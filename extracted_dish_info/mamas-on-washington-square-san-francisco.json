They satisfied both my savory and sweet cravings. \n- Their Bellini was also very refreshing, I highly recommend getting a drink with your brunch.

I think this strategy works well in SF since lines for breakfast seem to be common.  As far as Mama's go, I would be willing to wait 45 minutes, 60 minutes maximum.  Lucky for me, I was fortunate to be able to go to Mama's on an October Tuesday Morning.  BF and I got there at 7:45am and we were 5th and 6th in line.  The doors opened shortly after 8am and we had ordered and been seated by about 8:10am. I think it took ten minutes or so for our entrees to come out. Our brief wait was totally worth the deliciousness that followed.\n\nAt first I was disappointed to learn that there is only a partial waitress service here - diners order at the counter and seat themselves. When the food is up on the pass, a runner will deliver it to the table.  But, while waiting to place my order I got to see the ingredients Mama's was using.  Everything looked super fresh, hand picked and high quality.  Something else that looked good was the chocolate drizzle coffee cake so on an impulse I added that to my order.   Come to find out, that coffee cake was absolutely, positively delicious!  \n\nBF has been reading Yelp reviews so he knew to try the Monte Cristo sandwich, which is listed on the lunch menu but it actually served all day. Imagine slices of turkey, ham, cheddar and gruyere sandwiched between two pieces of bread that have been encased in battered egg and grilled.  Once battered, it is hard to tell where one slice of bread ends and the other begins.  The bread was slightly sweet but the inside was pure savory.  For additional sweetness, the sandwich is served with a side of jam.  I thought the bite of sandwich was good but for me there was too much going on for me to make a meal of it.\n\nAs usual, I went for a protein packed eggs benedict.  I ordered the North Beach which consisted of prosciutto and tomatoes.  It was tasty and the presentation was beautiful.  It was served with a side of breakfast tomatoes.

I can't decide if its Italian countryside, French countryside, rustic sheik or some other d\u00e9cor but I did like it.  Also, the restaurant is small so I don't recommend it for parties larger than four.  Finally, the wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  At the table next to me there was a mix up/miscommunication about what the lads had ordered and the waitress was super friendly and accommodating about it. \n\nI would definitely return to Mama's again on a weekday but I can't foresee myself hanging out on Stockton St. for two hours on a weekend morning.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-11-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Mamas on Washington square was hyped up to be the best brunch spot by my friend ", "but unfortunately I didn't share the same opinion - hence the four stars instead of five.

I don't really understand why this benedict was so expensive as all the benedicts on the regular menu were around $13-15; I suppose the cost was due to the fact that they used real crab, but even so, that is a huge price increase compared to the regular benedicts.\n\nThe Crab Cake Benedict was definitely tasty, but was it a mind-blowing, life-changing, 2.5 hour wait worthy benedict? Sadly, no. In fact, I had some issues with cutting into the English muffin portion of the benedict. Even though I was given a serrated knife, I had to put in some serious upper arm work to cut through the muffin -- luckily I work out or I would have been sore the next day from how much effort I had to put in. My friend who also ordered a benedict was also struggling to cut through his English muffin, so at least I have some peace of mind that it wasn't my (lack of) upper arm strength that failed me in trying to cut through the muffin.\n\nWhat I did enjoy about the benedict was how juicy the crab cakes were and the fact that the hollandaise sauce had a bit of spice to it which complemented the dish perfectly. I am normally not a fan of spice due to my low spice tolerance, but the spice on this sauce was a perfect amount to give something different and unexpected to an otherwise ordinary benedict.\n\nWhile Mama's on Washington has good food, the wait and service time to enjoy the food are simply not worth it.

We then had to wait another 10 mins inside the shack after paying at the cashier. That was a bit confusing. However, service was awesome and the food was pretty good--but not worth a 50 minute wait though. I had the Washington Square omelet for $10.99 (this was in 2013), which is pretty decent. The omelet was large and the home made raspberry jam was great. \n\nThe second visit to Mama's:\n\nWe waited for 15 minutes after getting there ~12pm. Our buddy came to visit SF and we wanted to give him the full SF experience. Harking back to my very good first visit, I decide that this place would be worth the premium price that they charge (most of the prices have gone up). I had a hard time deciding what to get this time since I had the omelet two years ago. I was really worried that I would be disappointed if I chose a sandwich versus breakfast item. But, summoning my courage, I decided to go with a sandwich: The Famous Monte Cristo for $12.95. \n\nThe presentation was very nice, complete with cute little triangle sandwiches, slices oranges topped with strawberries, their famous jam in the middle, and a side of your choosing. You can choose between potato salad, a regular mixed salad, or roasted potatoes. In my case, I told the cashier roasted potatoes, but I was served potato salad. I immediately told the waiter that I asked for roasted potatoes. She then proceed to ask the kitchen to get a free side plate of roasted potatoes compliments of the staff! All was going too well. \n\nBut after the first bite, I immediately regretted my decision in choosing the sandwich over the other breakfast items. The sandwich consisted of ham, turkey, melted cheese nestled in two bread slices that were dipped in egg and pan fried. The taste was underwhelming and each bite was drier than the last. Eating the first piece was ok, but by the time I got to the third piece I was overcome with boredom and dreaded consuming the last piece. The only savior to my dish was, ironically enough, the potato salad. The moisture was a good complement to the dry and boring sandwich. I was still hungry by the time I devoured the sandwich and potato salad, so thankfully I had the free side of roasted potatoes. After consuming the orange slices and the strawberries (none of which were in season, mind you), I was left a bit disappointed with my experience. If only I ordered the omelet like I did two years ago... \n\nBottom Line: Get there around noon to avoid the wait. Don't get the sandwiches; it's a breakfast place so treat yourself to an omelet or something. This is a place you need to try just once, since it's a premium price for decent, but not extraordinarily amazing food.

That is the only reason I endured circling around the area for 40 min looking for street parking, only to pay to park in a parking lot near chinatown, and then proceed to wait outside Mama's for another hour and 20 minutes. \n\nAfter waiting a total of 2 hours, we finally stepped into the quaint cafe furnished with plenty of homey knick knacks that you would find in your grandma's kitchen or living room. I adored the fresh flowers at each table and really appreciated the openness of the cafe. There were large windows that allowed plenty of natural lighting to spill through and light up the restaurant. \n\nInstead of being seated first, we were directed to order at the window first and then were allowed to pick from any open tables. We ordered the blackstone eggs benedict and the french toast sampler. After doing extensive yelping, it seemed like I'd be missing out on not trying the chocolate cinnamon french toast so I asked them to sub the regular cinnamon brioche for the chocolate cinnamon and they were happy to accommodate at no extra cost :) \n\nMama hit my major sweet tooth right on the spot with her delicious french toast. What makes this the best french toast I've ever had is the ridiculously flavorful slices of brioche. Each slice was moist, packed with warm spices, and the cranberry orange and banana nut brioche were studded with walnuts. The shining star of the show had to be the cinnamon french toast. It had the best texture, lightness, and overall flavor. The cinnamon brioche was the best bread for soaking up the french toast egg mixture (in the end the chocolate didn't add much). The banana bread was also delicious but slightly denser. The cranberry orange french toast was my least favorite but still better than any I've tried. \n\nDunk the french toast in syrup or do yourself a flavor and slather on a bit of the blackberry jam sitting innocently on your table. It wasn't too sweet and had a very bright berry flavor (I'd imagine it'd go amazing with a meyer lemon scone mmm). If you're not too careful, you could end up chugging the whole jar on the spot. \n\nThe eggs benedict were pretty customary, but too salty for my taste. I'm not much of a savory breakfast person so I'm biased but my friend said they were good, not amazing. We also ordered the old fashioned bar and a slice of carrot cake to go. The carrot cake fell short for me because it wasn't exceptional in any way and didn't have a cream cheese frosting but a rather plain buttercream frosting. The old fashioned was just average for me as well. It had an ok crumb topping but not really worth trying. \n\nWe received excellent and friendly service from everyone including the busboys! I never felt rushed during the meal and our water glasses were always filled. A busser was even kind enough to box my food and pack up some jam for me :) \n\nThe price for breakfast was fairly reasonable, about $10 or so a plate. However, the price for pastries that didn't blow my mind was somewhat stiff. \n\nFinal verdict: \nAll you french toast fanatics out there, this will now be our official congregation spot, 10 minutes or 2 hours, rain or shine. Everyone else, not really worth waiting more than 30 minutes in line for! I would also save my money for pastries elsewhere.

This sandwich alone gives this place five stars. Whoever invented this is a genius. Ham, turkey, cheddar, Havarti cheese stuffed between three slices of French toast with a side of homemade blackberry jam. Perfect balance of sweet and savory.

Delicious.\n\nSmoked Salmon Benedict - Same as above except replace with smoked salmon. It is a bit on the salty side, but goes well with the bland taste of the egg. \n\nPan Dore - This was probably not good for me at all. French baguette toasted with slices of sauteed apples drenched in lemon butter sauce. It was more like pure butter. If you have a heart condition, you should probably not eat this. One bite was enough, but anymore than that is a bit much. \n\nI should note that everything at this place tastes good with the homemade blackberry jam. Potatoes too dry? Dip it in the jam.

The one let down, which will not be reflected in the star rating, is the unavailability for credit card transactions, which was startling because it is the new age. What's interesting is that, I called ahead to make sure what forms of payments they take, though they take debit cards, credit cards are of another story. I think if an establishment is able to process debit cards, credit cards are no different (maybe with a small fee, but I think it's necessary). Service was prompt, fast, and the servers were accommodating. \n\nOn to the food: I ordered (1) Dungeness Crab Benedict [fresh lump crab meat, poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise, english muffins, and grilled potatoes] - WOW, delicious, well prepared, and with ACTUAL CRAB MEAT, MMMMMMM! (2) Smoked Salmon Benedict [smoked salmon, poached eggs, and english muffins] - my cousin gobbled it up! We shared (3) Kugelhopf French Toast [house made Kugelhopf, dates, almonds, raisins, and maple syrup] - YUM! It was a bit dry, somewhat caky, so make sure you drizzle some maple syrup (drench it!) and it'll taste superb! And (4) Monte Cristo [turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar and gruyere cheese, and grilled potatoes] - It was more on the sweet side with the jam, but once you cut into the filling, it's \"heaven in bread\", simply \"delicious\". (5) I drank some bubbly - Ruby Grapefruit Mimosa [refreshing!], and my cousin had (6) Mama's Smoothie [bananas, berries, orange juice, yogurt, and honey] - a great combination for a light and delicious drink. \n\nThis restaurant is a \"must go\" for those who love breakfast, and brunch!

Washington Square Omelette. - It was basically your standard omelette with italian sausages, tomato, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese sprinkled with some garnish. Nothing outrageously special here.. except that it was cooked to perfection! Woo!\n\n2. French Toast Sampler (French toast made out of Swedish Cinnamon bread, Cranberry Orange Walnut bread, and Banana Nut bread) -  Although personally the swedish cinnamon wasn't particularly a favorite of ours and cranberry orange walnut wasn't too strong, the banana nut bread just hit the spot!  It was amazing! None of these are overly sweet, and the french toast is topped off with fresh fruits with maple syrup that is subtly and perfectly sweet and complements the sweetness of the berries and toast very well.  I would strongly recommend getting just the banana nut french toast rather than the sampler, but of course, if you wanna try the various types of french toast they have here, be my guest.\n\n3. Monte Cristo - Golly, the thing everyone seems to talk about, and rightfully so! It's QUITE delectable and so rich and cheesy, I'm craving some right now as I'm writing this review! I don't want to spoil any more, but it's too amazing not to talk about it.  It looks like a boring, fat piece of french toast.  But inside.. seriously.. The perfect combination of turkey, ham, and melted gooey cheddar between two slices of bread with a subtle cheese taste. Once you top it off with their homemade jam, everything just melts in your mouth.\n\nSome ending thoughts: Their homemade jam is absolutely great! I think they sell em too but I forget. I'll be back there soon enough so I'll find out then. Lines are long, especially so with the chilly weather, but summer's coming up soon so that's not a concern woo!.. hopefully.

Ok, their OJ is really from the fruit and you can definitely taste it! You gotta try it! Their omelette was so yummy! It was packed with veggies and meat! Definitely filling for a day full of walking in SF. It's served with a side of toast, my choice was sourdough. Why not when you're in SF?!?!?

I've only been once because every time I pass by the line is out-the-door.  There is a funky system here whereby one orders her food and pays for it at the counter before getting a table.  The food is then brought out to the table after the person sits down.  I imagine they have this down to a science, and given the modest size of the restaurant, people probably order well before the kitchen is ready to prepare their meal.\n\nOn the one recent day that I finally did grace the interiors of Mama's, it was pleasant outside (upper 50s, perhaps) and it appeared that the line out the door wasn't too bad, and much more attractive than what I had witnessed previously.  I was, perhaps, the third or fourth person standing outside.  I didn't realize that there was another line at the counter waiting inside.  And even though the line wasn't so long, I still waited about 45 minutes before I got a table.  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I waited 45 minutes to sit down and about one hour before I got my omelette.  Was it good?  Sure.  Worth an hour of my life?  No way.  Did I mention that I arrived about 2:30p, just a half hour before closing, hoping to avoid the lunchtime crowds?  And I still had to wait an hour! \n\nThe omelette was good.  It was a vegetarian variety -- spinach, onions, egg whites, etc.  The breakfast potatoes were also pretty good.  I enjoyed the slices of homemade bread that they included on the plate.  But, was it better than Rick & Ann's in Berkeley, where I seldom have to wait more than 10 minutes?  Marginally, if at all.  (When Bette's Oceanview Diner does it right, its omelettes are better, though there is less variety).\n\nIt's a pleasant place, and on a nice sunny day, looking out over Washington Square is a delight.  But who wants to wait an hour for eggs?  The whole brunch thing is something that I simply don't get.  People flock to these tiny \"quaint\" places, wait in grostequely long lines for an interminable amount of time for eggs.\n\nIt's too bad.  My girlfriend loves brunch (her running favorite is Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley -- another place that has obscenely long waits; Mama's is worse).  I'd love to introduce her to Mama's to spice up our brunch rotation, but with food that more-or-less runs with the pack, why would I bother?  Why would anyone?\n\nGranted, as a vegetarian, there's a lot on the menu I wouldn't touch.  The person in front of my raved about their Monte Cristo; the person behind me was jonesin' for the Slim Joe Burger.  Perhaps with life-affirming options like those, I could be inspired to waste my life away for a meal at Mama's.  For vegetarians, however, it's the standard brunch alternatives (eggs, pancakes, french toast) or a handful (as in three) of additional vegetarian lunch options (quesadilla, sandwich, quiche).  I'm sure they are all reasonably satisfying, even if the options aren't as varied.\n\nIn a perfect world, I might venture out to try the French toast or the pancakes even though as someone who doesn't eat breakfast much I haven't eaten them in over twenty years.  But, alas, this world ain't perfect, and my time is too valuable to spend 90 minutes for a breakfast plate that at most I would acknowledge as good.\n\nI wish Mama well, but there are reasons why I moved out of the house long ago.\n\nPlease Note:  CASH ONLY.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-04-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I also love Washington square park and the neighborhood in general...\n\n"], "author": "Sapna E.", "review": "The food itself was really good!

The line was already down the block, half of it shaded, the front half of the line (right before you step inside) right in the sun.  \n\nWe waited nearly an hour outside, before stepping in doors to the \"inside line\" which was much shorter but allowed you time to see the chefs in action and some of their fresh baked goods.  The smell was amazing, and we loved watching the chefs cooking up their delicious treats.  We must have changed our minds about what to order 10 times while waiting inside.  We spent maybe 30 minutes inside waiting to order, and then waiting for a table to open up.\n\nMama's is a small restaurant (you could call it cozy if you're nice, \"cramped\" if you're upset).  It is nice and well maintained - and the staff was very friendly while we were there.  I can't imagine how hard it would be to be happy at all times when they are SO busy, but they did a good job of seeming that way.\n\nWe settled in on our orders - myself, I ordered the Washington Square Omlette (sausage, veggies, cheese) and my wife ordered the french toast sampler.  We also ordered a stack of buttermilk pancakes to share.  Yes, too much food for us...but really, we're on vacation, and we wanted to try it all.\n\nThe omlette was delicious - made especially so by the fantastic spicy italian sausage contained within.  It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned.  My favorite part of the entire meal.  \n\nMy wife's french toast sampler came with 3 different types of french toast - each delectable in their own right.  Very different.  We liked the banana bread french toast the best.  The pancakes as well were light, fluffy and delicious.  \n\nDon't forget to try the jam they have on the tables.  It's made fresh there and I can't remember the name - but it was great on toast, great on pancakes and great on french toast.  \n\nService was quick and efficient (it would have to be to keep this place moving and seeing as many patrons as they do), and it was a decent value for the price.  Portions are good sized, but not outrageous.  \n\nSo for us, the wait was worth it.  We would definitely return, although we'd probably try to get there earlier.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-07-15"}, {"excerpts": ["People napping on the grass of Washington Square.

We had been told by at least 10 people we had to go there and if we didn't get there early we'd be waiting in line.  The second part we screwed up.  After we were able to regain our equilibrium, walk and shake off the head fog from the previous night we headed towards\n\nMAMA'S ON WASHINGTON SQUARE\n\nMama's is a motherly feel inspired too small bakery and restaurant.  I say too small cause on a Friday around 11:30am when people should be working, this isn't LA where people don't work, we were standing behind about 30 people outside of Mama's.  We were told it's like this everyday and weekends are even worse.  Mama's line is like nothing I've ever seen (Pink's in LA is the closest).  While most restauants have a waiting list or people just hanging artound outside, at Mama's the line starts inside the restaruant at the register and travels up the block elementary school style, one person behind the other.  The employees regulate how many people come inside at a time and if you leave the line you're screwed, you've lost your place.  Standing there you wonder if Mama's is worth it?  Well you should see the food first.\n\nOur party of three ordered Prosciutto and Tomatoes Benedict, the Vegetarian Benedict and a special, the French Toast Sampler. \n\nThe Prosciutto and Tomatoes Benedict was very tasty, a mix of salty flavor from the prosciutto, creamy hollandaise sauce which was a little bitter or sour, which is a nice original touch.\n\nThe Vegetarian Benedict was just as tasty.  If you read me often you know from my burger eating that I'm as carnivor as they get, but this vegetarian dish packed the power of a carnivore's punch, full of flavor.\n\nThen came the sugar and like Jesse James' obsession with sexy tatted-up pinup models my obsession is with sugar.  I like Jesse's obsession just as much, but they don't have \"Those\" kinda girls at Mama's.  Not only did I order the French Toast Sampler but I ordered two slices of Cinnamon Sour Cream Walnut bread.  Today I was all about the carbs and the sugar.  The French Toast Sampler was fantastic, two of the three.  What was cool about their french toast was they make it with their sweet breads and cakes. (The basket of breads photo is what they use to make the french toast) One piece was banana nut topped with fresh bananas, swedish cinnamon topped with berries and another was cranberry orange walnut, which I could have done without (just my personal taste).  The banana nut and the swedish cinnamon was soo sweet and tasty I didn't even need syrup which is like Jesse James and Tiger Woods not needing sluts.\n\nBy the end of my french toast rampage I was stuffed.  I had also eaten the last bites of both of the Benedicts.  I stand to see good food go to waste, especially not after waiting 40 minutes in line.  But we were still left with the Cinnamon Sour Cream Walnut bread.  My friend and my cousin were waving the white flag.  BITCHES!  But I still had the motivation and will to at least try these heavenly sweet pieces of decadence.  I dove in and it was everyting every coffee cake in every coffee shop around the world tries to be.  It was sweet but not too sweet, spiced but not too much cinnamon, and soo moist I thought it was attracted to me.  (This is me chuckling.)\n\nI didn't try the Chocolate Drizzle Crumb or any of the other spectacular baked items they bake fresh daily, but they all looked amazing and if the line wasn't forever we probably would have gone back to try them. \n\nWhile Mamas is a great meal, a fantastic breakfast\nand was worth waiting in 40 minutes in line in the hot sun for, it wasn't good enough to do it again.  Nothing against Mama's but I don't really know any meals I'd wait 40 minutes for.  I totally go to Mama's again if I was back in SF but not if I had to wait in line.  No line means I'm there, otherwise SF offers too much good food to be standing in a line.  That 40 mintues we lost could have been 40 minutes of drinking, eating or finding tatted-up pinup models that we missed out on.\n\n-LAFoodGod", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-03-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Situated on a sunny corner of Washington Square, the place has got charm.

Who knew the love would last after all these years. \n\nWhen I first moved to the Bay Area in 99 a couple of friends wanted to take me to the City and kept raving about a place called Mama's. Now coming from the Midwest I had in mind a soul food place filled with comfort foods that would revert me back to that fat little kid from Indianapolis however when you get there you realize (1) this isn't that type of place and (2) its going to be a loooooong wait to get in.  It's bad enough that parking can be extremely tricky in the Washington Square area however even more discouraging is looking at a long line that brings back memories of my club hopping days. Fortunately for people like me unlike those SF clubs, Mama's welcomes all walks and not just the \"best looking/best dressed\". From the tourist from France, to the young couple in love, to the pet owner who dresses her dogs in sweaters although its 85, to the guy flying solo who comes only with a word puzzle. \n\nOnce you get up to the window you almost feel like its teasing you... you can see but don't touch as you see happy customers slowly enjoying their food as you watch like young Oliver begging for more. When your ushered in you notice even more how SMALL this place is. Just imagine your dorm room in college and subtract a couple feet. You start to wonder where there going to squeeze you in when your drawn to the cooks using their utensils like artists. You gaze over the fresh made breads, fruits, and omelets just made and think you know what you want until something else is made then you change it again... and again.I've had several amazing items including very delicious  Dungeness Crab Benedict , Nelson's Rancheros, and the\nNorthern Italian however the one thing I come all the way from San Jose to Mama's for is the same thing over and over... the Monte Crisco Sandwich. I order it so much that guy who I always see there knows what I want and this is even after I had not been there in over a year! Talk about knowing your customers! The Monte Crisco sandwich is the one thing that people will stare and point at you through the window. If you've never had it you MUST try it... a perfect combination of Turkey, Baked Ham, Cheddar and Havarti Cheese Bread dipped in Egg and grilled served with Homemade Raspberry Jam cut in triangles dusted with powdered sugar that will make make you feel like your eating at a 5 star restaurant while sporting flip flops.  First time I was told about it I thought there was no way I eat a sandwich with raspberry dipping sauce but after one bite I was a believer. Wash it down with a cold Mimosa and your day starts off better than anything Tony The Tiger puts out there.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite place for breakfast or brunch in the City. Delicious FRESH foods, nice staff, interesting people to meet in line, and one of the oddest places for a bathroom you'll ever see... trust me just make the trip back there and you'll see. No matter what your taste in food is, you'll find something there to savor. The only cons...  Long days you can stand in line for up to 1 1/2 hours so you might have to run to the meter again and put more money in since parking authority has a cruel sense of humor in SF. Not sure how they could do it in that space but like to see them get a lil bigger so you don't invest 3 hours of your morning just for breakfast, and also like to see Mama's come into the year 2010 and start accepting plastic instead of cash. Mama's though is the type of place you normally see in movies that you wish you could also experience.

The wait is long and draining, but it is well worth it! \n\nI've tried several different items at this popular breakfast place including:\n\nOmelettes: Washington square (italian sausage, peppers, cheese and tomatoes) and Mama's Children's Favourite (tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, cheese). Both of these omelettes are amazing. They are piled with fillings that are chunky so you have the satisfying bite to your omelette. They are also huge and take up half the plate alongside crispy homefries and your choice of wheat, white, rye or sourdough toast. If you are opting for something savory, definitely go for the omelette and you will be satisfied for hours as the portions are big enough for both breakfast and lunch.\n\nPancakes: hot, fluffy, perfect and so satisfying! The creamy soft texture with the perfect blend of savory and sweet paired with a warm maple syrup topped with icing sugar is perfect for pancake lovers. The best pancakes I've tasted.\n\nFrench Toast: Kugelhumph french toast with dates, cinammon and nuts is the perfect wake up medley of sweet syrup and crunchy creamy brioche bread.\n\nCorned Beef Hash: (a special and not always offered everyday) The best in the city! the perfect mix of two over easy eggs, fresh shredded semi-lean corned beef and crispy bite size potatoes. Hit it with some ketchup and tobasco sauce along with an oozing yolk and you've got a plate of caloric goodness that is worth every bite. \n\nNOW, the sourdough toast is an essential selection in all of the bread options that come with your meal. The crispy yet warm buttery bread paired with the excellent olallieberry jam that is readily available on all tables is one of the main reasons I go to Mama's. Their jam is amazingly the perfect combination of sweet and tart with chunks of olallieberries drowning inside a syrupy concoction. I was tempted to swipe that container of jam into my purse as it is homemade and not available for purchase. \n\nThe baked instore items such as the lemon berry muffin and banana bread is served warm when you order in the store. They also have carrot cake, blueberry crumble cake, apple crumble cake, and other varieties. \n\nTheir coffee is always hot and refilled constantly with the friendly yet efficient service. It is always a mouthwatering 10 minutes when you stand in line observing  the cooks casually cook up a storm behind the glass of baked treats while you decide on your order. \n\nSo go early, bring a jacket and stand in line to wait for a perfect breakfast in San Francisco!", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered the Washington Square and the chicken  ", "caesar salad.

I had woken up uncharacteristically early one morning at 6:30a, strategically woke my bf up for some morning \"fun\", and we decided to walk to Mama's for breakfast afterwards.  By the time we got there at 8:00a, the line was really long!  It took us 1.5 hours to get through the line out front and to get through the line inside.  I had the french toast and my bf had the Washington square and we both LOVED our food.

I had never been able to go back to Mama's because it's just so hard to get up that early and I don't have weekdays off anymore.

We got to Mama's around 7:30 and found several parking spots open right in front! Score! We also saw a line about 20 or so people deep.  No score...  Still, we knew we would get in for the first seating, so we waited in line.  My bf ordered the crab egg benedict and I  ordered the Monte Cristo.  Bf said his egg benedict was okay.  The crab tasted like they had cooked and shelled it the day before and there was something off about it.  I liked the Monte Cristo, but it's not something I would order again.  I thought the OJ tasted diluted.

You pretty much order what you've been eyeing on the menu before you get led to your assigned table. The workers are all hard-working and nice, but are definitely busy so it may be hard to get one's attention right away. My boyfriend and I ordered the French Toast Sampler, The Californian Omelette, Northern Italian Omelette, Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice, and a smoothie.\n\nCalifornian Omelette - Prepared very well with crispy bacon, avocado, and Monterey Jack Cheese. Not too burnt or watery, and very fluffy. Delicious, but I would not recommend it because it is a bit on the plainer side (I'd suggest an omelette with more ingredients in it).\n\nNorthern Italian Omelette - Includes Italian Cured Bacon, mushroom, fresh basil, tomatoes, and garlic jack cheese. My boyfriend loved this one; me not so much. I thought it was a bit too pepper-y or too many spices in a bite for my taste. But try it for yourself, I'm sure it's delicious :)\n\nFreshly Squeezed Orange Juice - Very freshtasting and delicious. Quenches your thirst perfectly on a hot day. Recommended.\n\nSmoothie - Delicious and fresh tasting as well. You can taste the blended texture of fresh fruits and not something artificial at all. Recommended.\n\nFrench Toast Sampler - Very good, and I would recommend it for everybody to try! It features three different types/flavors of toasts, and I enjoyed the one that tasted like cinnamon the most. Comes with syrup and fruits such as blueberries, strawberries, and bananas. Definitely big enough to split too.\n\nI hope my recommendations help you with your first or returning visit, but this place is definitely a must-try to check off of your foodie bucketlist!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Northern Italian (omelet)"], "author": "Judy V.", "review": "I am so bummed that this place did not live up to the hype.\n\nWe've waited in line for almost an hour and half on a Tuesday morning.

It's Mama's, that restaurant that always has a ridiculous line (even when it's freaking closed) and is on every to-eat list in San Fracisco.  The question for such a restaurant usually boils down to 'is it worth it', to which I typically say 'probaby not, but let's give it a shot'.  Being the kind of person who actually doesn't mind lines all that much (you're probably with friends if it's a restaurant, right?), it becomes about the charm.  The food, the service, the smiles; oh, how Mama's lacks.\n\nFirst things first: the line.  Expect it to be apparently over an hour, especially if you don't feel like getting up early.  And then once inside, you line up to order at a register, your butts in some other eater's faces, themselves cramped into a small table in a tiny restaurant.

And considering the three types of toast are as different as flavor profiles can be, it's odd that three different fruits are dumped on the top of the all of them - acceptable for your mama while at home, but not a restaurant serving alledgedly the best French toast on this coast.

Oh yeah, and a coffee and mimosa.  What the hell--it was my birthday!\n\nUm, wait about two minutes then our table was ready, then waited less than five and these plates overflowing with deliciousness came our way.  The waiter was SO nice--told us to use the homemade jam on the pancakes instead of the syrup and had a great sense of humor.  We dug in and--heaven.  I don't know what else to call it.  We didn't know if we should enjoy our own plate, eat off each other's, eat the pancakes....ey.  Crab meat was fluffy and fresh, no brown in the avocado, the cheese in my omelet with the pancetta was the tastiest thing ever...and the pancakes!  Good lord.\nOh, and the mimosa?  Fresh squeezed OJ splashed into champagne.  Yes, it's worth the price.  \n\nProbably the only thing that wasn't remarkable was the coffee, but that's probably because it got cold as I tried to eat as much as possible before I started to feel full.\n\nThat's all I can say, really.

Who knew the love would last after all these years. \n\nWhen I first moved to the Bay Area in 99 a couple of friends wanted to take me to the City and kept raving about a place called Mama's. Now coming from the Midwest I had in mind a soul food place filled with comfort foods that would revert me back to that fat little kid from Indianapolis however when you get there you realize (1) this isn't that type of place and (2) its going to be a loooooong wait to get in.  It's bad enough that parking can be extremely tricky in the Washington Square area however even more discouraging is looking at a long line that brings back memories of my club hopping days. Fortunately for people like me unlike those SF clubs, Mama's welcomes all walks and not just the \"best looking/best dressed\". From the tourist from France, to the young couple in love, to the pet owner who dresses her dogs in sweaters although its 85, to the guy flying solo who comes only with a word puzzle. \n\nOnce you get up to the window you almost feel like its teasing you... you can see but don't touch as you see happy customers slowly enjoying their food as you watch like young Oliver begging for more. When your ushered in you notice even more how SMALL this place is. Just imagine your dorm room in college and subtract a couple feet. You start to wonder where there going to squeeze you in when your drawn to the cooks using their utensils like artists.

Delicious FRESH foods, nice staff, interesting people to meet in line, and one of the oddest places for a bathroom you'll ever see... trust me just make the trip back there and you'll see. No matter what your taste in food is, you'll find something there to savor. The only cons...  Long days you can stand in line for up to 1 1/2 hours so you might have to run to the meter again and put more money in since parking authority has a cruel sense of humor in SF. Not sure how they could do it in that space but like to see them get a lil bigger so you don't invest 3 hours of your morning just for breakfast, and also like to see Mama's come into the year 2010 and start accepting plastic instead of cash. Mama's though is the type of place you normally see in movies that you wish you could also experience.

The egg just melts in your mouth and the smoke salmon was so fresh and capers added a nice flavor. It balanced the salmon for sure. Also, I tried my friends Monte Cristo and 2nd best in my opinion.

It is basically a french toast ham and cheese sandwich served beautifully on a powder sugared plate. You can choose to bite right into the crispy exterior of the french toast and let the warm ham and cheese slowly fill into your taste buds, OR you can choose to cut the sandwich up into tiny pieces and dip them into a sweet syrup before your epic indulgence. \n\nReason Number Two: CRAB BENEDICT\nThe Dungeness Crab Benedict is so delicious that it would make Benedict Arnold come back over to the U.S. Army. It's pretty hard to turn your back on fresh-tasting crab engulfed in egg yolk and hollandaise sauce. You can betray your country Mr. Arnold, but you can't betray your tummy!\n\nReason Number Three: HYPE\nAs good as Mama's is, the wait is 2.5 hours no joke on a bloke. So if you go consistently, you must either be a very patient grasshopper or simply a bonafide hypebeast. Let's be real, we are only talking about breakfast food. I don't care how organic the eggs are or how much powdered sugar they put on the plate, no brunch should be worth waiting 2.5 hours for under the heat of the blazing North Beach sun.\n\nWith that being said, I'll probably still go to Mama's if I know of a friend that hasn't been here before.

Right across the street from Washington Square Park in North Beach, sits Mama's, a rather small establishment known for their \"to die for\" breakfast. I planned today to brunch with my cousin, and had her wait in line while I Barted in. She wrote me a text, \"hurry, where are you, there's no line, oh wait, it was hiding,it is long\".\n\nThe line wasn't terrible, but the cold weather certainly made it seem like \"forever\". The longest I have ever waited for food was in New York, SoHo: Dominque Ansel's Cronut - three hours in line was certainly \"forever\". My cousin and I, as well as other patient guests, stared inside as people ate and we drooled for their food. We came hungry! I arrived at 9:30AM and we were let inside to the warmth at around 11. Be sure to come prepared, because there are no menus at the tables. Upon entering the restaurant, you are directed to the registers, and once you order, you will then be seated. It is very organized! The one let down, which will not be reflected in the star rating, is the unavailability for credit card transactions, which was startling because it is the new age. What's interesting is that, I called ahead to make sure what forms of payments they take, though they take debit cards, credit cards are of another story. I think if an establishment is able to process debit cards, credit cards are no different (maybe with a small fee, but I think it's necessary). Service was prompt, fast, and the servers were accommodating. \n\nOn to the food: I ordered (1) Dungeness Crab Benedict [fresh lump crab meat, poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise, english muffins, and grilled potatoes] - WOW, delicious, well prepared, and with ACTUAL CRAB MEAT, MMMMMMM! (2) Smoked Salmon Benedict [smoked salmon, poached eggs, and english muffins] - my cousin gobbled it up! We shared (3) Kugelhopf French Toast [house made Kugelhopf, dates, almonds, raisins, and maple syrup] - YUM! It was a bit dry, somewhat caky, so make sure you drizzle some maple syrup (drench it!) and it'll taste superb! And (4) Monte Cristo [turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar and gruyere cheese, and grilled potatoes] - It was more on the sweet side with the jam, but once you cut into the filling, it's \"heaven in bread\", simply \"delicious\". (5) I drank some bubbly - Ruby Grapefruit Mimosa [refreshing!], and my cousin had (6) Mama's Smoothie [bananas, berries, orange juice, yogurt, and honey] - a great combination for a light and delicious drink. \n\nThis restaurant is a \"must go\" for those who love breakfast, and brunch! It is absolutely \"worth the wait\".", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-10-27"}, {"excerpts": ["The first bite of the the Dungeness Crab benedict...

Is there usually a long wait? Yes. Is it worth it? Pretty darn close. However, I knew this beforehand so that did not bother me at all. \n\nA good tip to know is that the waiter service isn't like your typical one. Yes, there are people that bring your food to you, however, you actually pay for your entire meal before you sit down. It does make it a lot easier to just get up and go about your day when you're done because you don't have to wait for someone to bring you your bill and for them to cash you out. \n\nI really wanted to dungeness crab benedict since I thought it would be super drool worthy.

The salmon was super rich but not heavy, and adding the avocado to it added just the right amount of that something that I was looking for. \n\nGot a carrot cake to-go for the bf since he was at home, and I knew he would probably want something from Mama's. The cake itself was pretty good, however, at times the texture was a bit off, but the taste was still there. The frosting, though, was absolutely creamy, dreamy, and delicious. I kinda cheated and whilst sharing with him turned into a frosting hog. It was so good that he called me out several times, whoops. :)\n\nTo top everything off I got a drink, mimosa to be exact, at brunch, of course. However, I noticed they had two kinds of mimosas, the regular OJ, and another one that I've never seen paired with champagne...grapefruit! Interesting! I had to get it! I asked them to put more champagne than grapefruit, and wow...hit the spot. I seriously loved my grapefruit mimosa. So refreshing. So delicious. So addictive. Trust me, get it.

Saw a line. Still telling each other, \"this is going to be great..\"  I kept telling myself it will be just a few minutes 'til I eating some of Mama's food.

We had to wait in yet another line! Geez... well can't turn back now since we already survived a 55+ minute wait outside. The line inside was shorter, it was only about 15 minutes. You have to wait in line to order and pay for your food. NOTE: it is CASH or DEBIT only! There's a $1 fee if you use your debit card.  Our bill ended up at $57.20.. The reason for the line is because we're waiting on other diners to get up and free up the tables. Man, I was so upset I saw some peeps who were already done eating, still seating down texting on their cell phones.. Seriously, get up and go so the rest of us can eat some tasty Mama's food.

Finally, the waiter brings 2 dishes out. The crab benedict and the crab omelette. We immediately split our plate half-and-half. Based on the Yelp review I immediately opted to fork over some crab benedict into my mouth...and it. was. a. little..... disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it was good but not *that* good, definitely not based on all the hooplah I read about on yelp. No worries though, it's still pretty good, just nothing special. Next I tried the crab omelette.. now, that. was. the...... bomb.com!!!! It was sooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooood, like slap yo' Mama good! Yum!!! It's like I couldn't eat it fast enough, hmmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm goooood! ; ))  \n\nThey kinda skimped on the crab on the benedict, but the omelette was filled with crab, it was so good! I was full and I still wanted more of that omelette. However, some of the homestyle fries were kinda burnt, not good! Next, they brought the french toast sampler. There were 3 types--the Swedish french toast, the banana nut, and the low-fat apple yogurt cinnamon. There were all good. I didn't really care too much for the banana nut bread french toast, it was a little dry for me, but I put the homemade jam on it and it helped! I loved the Swedish cinnamon and the apple yogurt cinnamon, I could hardly believe it was low-fat!\n\nBottom line, everything was pretty good. I'm glad I went, I think it was worth the wait.

I used to come here as a kid and their breakfast haunted me into adulthood.

Figured it was just the wrong day so we said we'd come back another day when it wasn't so busy.  I decided to do some research and then realized that a long wait is to be expected at good ol' Mama's - due to all of the media coverage it's delectable food has received.  So, mostly you'll find tourists waiting in the long line waiting to get a taste of this San Francisco treat.  \n\nFor my next venture to Mama's I was a bit more prepared.  My boyfriend and I decided to go on the 4th of July, figuring a weekday wouldn't be as busy... even though it was a holiday.  Luckily we only had to wait about an hour to get inside.  We ordered our food at the counter where you could see the cooks cooking away the scrumdiliumptiousness.  We ordered 4 items off the menu: The French Toast sampler, The Lox Bagel Platter, the Dungeness Crab Benedict, and the Californian Omelette... oh and we ordered their tasty beverages too... Mama's Spiked Lemonade and Fresh Squeezed Mimosas.  \n\nI was a little nervous that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered it to be back when I was a kid - but nope... DEEEEEEEELECTABLE!  I wasn't a fan of all of the french toasts... my favorite was the original, but even the one I wasn't too fond of (the Kugelhopf) was still better than your average french toast you get when ordering out.  The Lox Bagel Platter was SO good.  I'm really picky when it comes to salmon and I couldn't stop eating this thing.  Yum... I want to eat it right now.  The Californian Omelette was delicious and fresh - loved the potatoes that came with them.  And the Dungeness Crab Benedict was tasty too!  After devouring all of that we moved onto the toast and their special homemade jam that's sitting on the table.

That being said, I've never felt like I needed to rush through my meal to make room for the crowd outside waiting to be seated. The servers are always polite and I've always had a good dining experience there.\n\nNow about the food. There are so many things to choose from on the menu, so even though I've been here many times, I always have something new to try. One of their most popular dishes has got to be the Monte Cristo. They are triangular pieces of bread stuffed with ham, cheese, and turkey, battered in egg, grilled, and served with homemade jam. It's absolutely delicious!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something sweet, their french toasts are a great option. They really are very tasty (writing this review is making me crave for them right now)! If it's your first time here, I suggest you try their french toast sampler. This typically includes banana nut, cranberry orange walnut, and Swedish cinnamon french toast, but it depends on what breads they have available that day. The french toast is topped with a generous amount of fresh fruits and dusted off with powdered sugar. It's perfection on a plate.\n\nTheir eggs benedicts are delicious as well. They have a dungeness crab benedict on their specialty menu and what I love about it is that they don't skimp on the crab. It's a bit more pricey than the other dishes but you do get what you pay for. I've also tried the Paisano benedict, which has pancetta and grilled peppers in it. Delicious. \n\nBottom line: There is always a long line but it really is worth the wait.

They use 3 different house-baked breads and top them off with bananas and a trio of fresh berries.  One of the staff tipped us off to using the house-made olallieberry (a blackberry-raspberry hybrid) jam that sat on our table, which made a great breakfast plate even more amazing.\nThere is not much on the menu for vegans, but ovo-lacto vegetarians will rejoice!\n\nPrice:\nSome things are more expensive than others.  The majority of their breakfast and lunch items are reasonably priced ($7-10).  A few select items are a little on the pricey side, but justifiable.  Substitutions cost extra.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe interior is kind of small (hence the long waits), but so cute and homey.  I felt like I was in Mama's cozy breakfast nook.  Photographs and newspaper clippings about the establishment decorate the walls. We came on a day where the rare San Francisco sunlight poured into the room, creating a soft, sweet glow.\n\nRestroom:\nI wouldn't describe the bathroom as an \"outhouse\" like another Yelper wrote.  OK, it's not your traditional WC; you have to walk through the kitchen and outside and down a small set of stairs.  There is only one and it is unisex (so it smells a little like sperm).  But it's got a toilet, mirror, soap, and sink... what more do you need?\n\nParking:\nSucks.  You can drop off your friend(s) to wait in line while you circle around looking for a free parking spot.  Or do what I did:  I walked from my hotel, which was in Union Square (Tenderloin-adjacent).  It was a brisk 30-minute walk.  Just about all of SF is walk-able (that is, IF you are able to walk).  Or take the MUNI (30, 39, 41, 45, 8X).\n\nOverall Review:  \nThere is a reason why there are over 2000 highly favorable reviews (and counting) on Yelp.  There is a reason why Mama's consistently finds herself on numerous \"Best of\" lists.  There is a reason why people line up around the block and wait 1-3 hours.  I have waited 4 long years to try this place.  Was it worth the wait?  Yes!  Does it live up to the hype?  Yes!  Will I be back?  Yes!  Is $20+ a bit much to pay for a breakfast plate?  Yes, but I have to take into consideration that they use REAL crab.  They get bonus points for giving back to the community.\n\nTips:\nGo early.  Like, 30-to-45-mins-before-they-open-early.  If you don't want that big of a wait, I would recommend that you also go close to closing time because they do serve breakfast all day, BUT you may run the risk of them running out of certain food items.\nCertain dishes are only available on the weekend.  Use that opportunity to try something that you wouldn't be able to get Tuesday-Friday.\nBring cash or your debit card.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-09-18"}, {"excerpts": ["In addition to the pancakes, I ordered the dungeness crab benedict - which were amazing ", "but they could have added a bit more crab for $21.

The food was really good overall.  And ambience and service were excellent.  We left satisfied and happy.  We all agreed we must come again! \n\nIt was tough deciding what to order, as the menu was full of goodies.  We ended up going with a Monte Cristo, the Dungeness Crab Benedict, and the Northern Italian Omelette.  We dined family style and shared everything.\n\nThe MONTE CRISTO was a thing of beauty.  Four golden wedges of turkey/ham/cheese sandwiches egged and grilled into perfect, perfect French toast.  Lightly dusted with powdered sugar and accompanied by a small ramekin of homemade boysenberry sauce.  Oh my goodness, savory and sweet, warm and light, this dish answered every one of my needs!  As I took my first bite, my mind began to hum.  :)\n\nThe DUNGENESS CRAB BENEDICT was also quite good.  The poached eggs especially were done really well.  The egg whites were so tender, but still completely cooked.  And though I'm not a big fan of crab usually, I enjoyed the meat here, which was fresh and tasty.  The Hollandaise was also nice and mustardy.  I'm glad they didn't drench the whole dish in it.  The English muffins at the bottom, though, were soggy and a little sad.\n\nThe NORTHERN ITALIAN OMELETTE was a let down for me, but my two dining partners really enjoyed it.  I found the egg overcooked, with both the texture and the flavor reminding me of a rubber ball.  Very strange.  The filling was also lackluster and rather generic.  I didn't taste any basil or pancetta.  Maybe it was late in the day and some ingredients ran out.  But again, the people sitting to my left and right thought it was good.  \n\nThe grilled red potatoes that came with each of the dishes were so-so.  My sister makes the ultimate oven roasted version with cilantro/garlic pesto and peanut butter(!), so perhaps I'm overly critical here.\n\nThe housemade berry jam, which is really more of a sauce in texture, is very good and also pretty for the eye.  It's magenta, a little tart and not too sweet.  A drop of it goes well with everything.  \n\nService was excellent all around.  The wait staff, the bussers were across the board very efficient and courteous.  The owner was also very personable.  All are truly praiseworthy.  The vibe at Mama's is full of goodwill and welcome.

Very long. So you must go there with someone whose company you truly enjoy, so much so that the SF chilly wind wouldn't bother you. Otherwise, you would inevitably raise your expectations for the food to compensate for the pain, which is not really fair (especially if you intend to yelp afterwards).\n\nSecond, Mama's has some interesting dishes you would not want to miss. Their serving portion is generous. Unless you are going there in a large group, and especially if you are going there with just one another person besides yourself, make sure that your companion LOVES to eat and LOVES to eat a lot.  \n\nThe first time I tried Mama's, the wait didn't bother me. Love was in the air. We shared Dugeness crab benedict, day's special omelet, and the combination french toast. Needless to say, the 6'3\" 230+ lbs then-boyfriend and 5'3\" *cough* I cleaned up the plates, smiling, laughing, and savoring each bite. The french toast was made of three different kinds of sweet bread, which gave each slice different texture and varying degree of sweetness. It's fun sharing it with someone and discuss which one's your favorite and why. With the homemade jam, this was the best french toast I'd ever tasted. The Dungeness crab benedict was made of fresh and authentic ingredients, where each ingredient retained its original flavor yet worked together beautifully. This was truly a 5+ star experience. \n\nThe second time I went there, the wind seemed colder. The wait seemed much longer. Once inside, I ordered the divine french toast to boost my mood along with some kind of eggs benedict, and the pretty boy ordered  the Dungeness crab benedict. After a long wait, the food was served, and I was disappointed. The poached eggs were over-cooked. The model-thin pretty boy didn't seem to enjoy eating too much and just poked his eggs and took a few bites of crab. The french toast was still good but went cold and hard barely touched. The food was still good, but the magic was gone.

I'd pass on the crab benedict the next time since the Hollandaise sauce masks the taste of the fresh crab anyway.  Everything else was under $10 and I could go back every day of the week to try more of their French toasts.   \n\nI've totally been craving the Monte Cristo but it seems easy to make at home.

Who knew the love would last after all these years. \n\nWhen I first moved to the Bay Area in 99 a couple of friends wanted to take me to the City and kept raving about a place called Mama's. Now coming from the Midwest I had in mind a soul food place filled with comfort foods that would revert me back to that fat little kid from Indianapolis however when you get there you realize (1) this isn't that type of place and (2) its going to be a loooooong wait to get in.  It's bad enough that parking can be extremely tricky in the Washington Square area however even more discouraging is looking at a long line that brings back memories of my club hopping days. Fortunately for people like me unlike those SF clubs, Mama's welcomes all walks and not just the \"best looking/best dressed\". From the tourist from France, to the young couple in love, to the pet owner who dresses her dogs in sweaters although its 85, to the guy flying solo who comes only with a word puzzle. \n\nOnce you get up to the window you almost feel like its teasing you... you can see but don't touch as you see happy customers slowly enjoying their food as you watch like young Oliver begging for more. When your ushered in you notice even more how SMALL this place is. Just imagine your dorm room in college and subtract a couple feet. You start to wonder where there going to squeeze you in when your drawn to the cooks using their utensils like artists.

Wash it down with a cold Mimosa and your day starts off better than anything Tony The Tiger puts out there.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite place for breakfast or brunch in the City. Delicious FRESH foods, nice staff, interesting people to meet in line, and one of the oddest places for a bathroom you'll ever see... trust me just make the trip back there and you'll see. No matter what your taste in food is, you'll find something there to savor. The only cons...  Long days you can stand in line for up to 1 1/2 hours so you might have to run to the meter again and put more money in since parking authority has a cruel sense of humor in SF. Not sure how they could do it in that space but like to see them get a lil bigger so you don't invest 3 hours of your morning just for breakfast, and also like to see Mama's come into the year 2010 and start accepting plastic instead of cash. Mama's though is the type of place you normally see in movies that you wish you could also experience.

Based on reading other yelp reviews, I hear that there are usually long line ups so that's why the bf and I woke up early to get to this place to eat a hearty breakfast.\n\nAnyway, I wasn't going to give up based on a silly snaffoo so the bf and I woke up early the next day to come to this place to eat breakfast. No lineups thank god BUT it was a full-house...jam-packed place! Unbelievable. I think it was only half an hour after the opening hours and the place was packed. \n\nThe bf ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich french toast sandwich with fries (no salad). I thought it was a sandwich but it was cool that it was like french toast...soft and fluffy. I, on the other hand, had a hard time selecting my food because I was hoping I could get more points on choosing good food since the bf is at 7 points of choosing good restaurants and good food while I only have 3 points. I selected the dungeness crab omelette with avocado and tomatoes with whole wheat toast. It sounded really yummy. I should have kept things simple. The crab meat was rich so that's a bonus but maybe it wasn't the best combination to have egg with it. The avocodo was so mushy that I couldn't find my tomatoes...The bf sensed that I didn't really like my food so he passed me off his plate :) So the bf with 8 points and me still 3 points. \n\nJust for the first comers, you need to order first before getting a table.

My crab cake Benedict arrived next... and what a disappointment it was! First off, the portion size was SUPER small! Two small ass benedicts with maybe 6 or 7 potato slices. Um, WHAT? If I'm paying you $25 for breakfast, you better FEED ME damnit! \n\nI cut into the Benedict... and I was appalled. No runny egg yolk... at ALL! These eggs were completely overcooked! To top it off, it tasted horrible. Bland and the crab cake was just nasty! I started to wonder if they had served me bad crab. The potatoes were mushy and cold. One of the biggest lies that I've ever told occurred here on this day... when one of the cooks asked me if it was good. My heart was broken, but I did not want to break his heart after what was probably a long work day for him. I just nodded and smiled. \n\nWhat was perhaps the most disturbing element of this entire experience was how the owner/manager continued to let people in while his employees begged him to stop. They looked drained and tired and I overhead him say that he would make them serve people until there was nobody else left at the door. I understand from a business standpoint, but these people have lives and families. It lightweight sickened me, and I started rushing to get out of there because I was so uncomfortable. I also witnessed how they completely forgot to make an order for one of the family's children and then just ignored the mistake. \n\nNot sure if this was an off day, but there was just way too many bad vibes in there for me to ever consider going back at this point. 2 stars instead of 1 because of the hard working staff and the friendly owner (he was friendly to the guests at least).", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-08-08"}, {"excerpts": ["The food came promotly my friend also ordered the north beach eggs Benedict that we shared. \n\n", "For my friends north beach eggs Benedict it was really delicious as well.

It was so good!! I'm in love with sweet and savory dishes and this dish hit that spot quite perfectly. I would eat the jam everyday if I could! I honestly would want to know the secret specialness that makes this jam because it's perfect. The sandwich seems like it's deep fried/ French toast and the inside is the meat and cheese.

I think this strategy works well in SF since lines for breakfast seem to be common.  As far as Mama's go, I would be willing to wait 45 minutes, 60 minutes maximum.  Lucky for me, I was fortunate to be able to go to Mama's on an October Tuesday Morning.  BF and I got there at 7:45am and we were 5th and 6th in line.  The doors opened shortly after 8am and we had ordered and been seated by about 8:10am. I think it took ten minutes or so for our entrees to come out. Our brief wait was totally worth the deliciousness that followed.\n\nAt first I was disappointed to learn that there is only a partial waitress service here - diners order at the counter and seat themselves. When the food is up on the pass, a runner will deliver it to the table.  But, while waiting to place my order I got to see the ingredients Mama's was using.  Everything looked super fresh, hand picked and high quality.  Something else that looked good was the chocolate drizzle coffee cake so on an impulse I added that to my order.   Come to find out, that coffee cake was absolutely, positively delicious!  \n\nBF has been reading Yelp reviews so he knew to try the Monte Cristo sandwich, which is listed on the lunch menu but it actually served all day. Imagine slices of turkey, ham, cheddar and gruyere sandwiched between two pieces of bread that have been encased in battered egg and grilled.  Once battered, it is hard to tell where one slice of bread ends and the other begins.  The bread was slightly sweet but the inside was pure savory.  For additional sweetness, the sandwich is served with a side of jam.  I thought the bite of sandwich was good but for me there was too much going on for me to make a meal of it.\n\nAs usual, I went for a protein packed eggs benedict.  I ordered the North Beach which consisted of prosciutto and tomatoes.  It was tasty and the presentation was beautiful.  It was served with a side of breakfast tomatoes.  In general I think breakfast potatoes are just meh but I was glad to use them to sop up the yolky and hollandaise goodness from my benny.\n\nA few other notes - the d\u00e9cor here is homey and cute.  I can't decide if its Italian countryside, French countryside, rustic sheik or some other d\u00e9cor but I did like it.  Also, the restaurant is small so I don't recommend it for parties larger than four.  Finally, the wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  At the table next to me there was a mix up/miscommunication about what the lads had ordered and the waitress was super friendly and accommodating about it. \n\nI would definitely return to Mama's again on a weekday but I can't foresee myself hanging out on Stockton St. for two hours on a weekend morning.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-11-05"}, {"excerpts": ["North Beach Benedict - prosciutto and grilled tomato.

The hollandaise sauce on these egg benedicts were soo good. You can tell right away it's not going to be too rich due the color of the sauce. If it's too yellow, it's too rich and overwhelming. But the light yellow hollandaise sauce was amazing and I finished all of it.\n\n3. I normally don't like french toast, but these were pretty good. Also, it was the most prettiest plate I have ever seen in my life. I MEAN LOOK AT THE COLORS OF THAT PLATE.\n\n4. MONTEEEEEEEEEE CRISTOOOOOOOOOO. need i say more? This isn't your average monte cristo. It's not oily at all. Its crispy on the outside and gooey and cheesy on the inside. And that raspberry jam it comes with oh my god. Remember this is an ALL DAY food item so you can order this for breakfast too! I wish I would have just ordered this as my main dish. Damn it was good. \n\n5. You know the chefs there are perfectionist because everything was perfectly made and delicious! The waiters there are so kind and they kept refilling our drinks and they smiled a lot which is always a plus because I know they love what they're doing :)\n\nWORTH THE WAIT.

So why are people lining up for 2.5 hours at the corner of North Beach? Because Mama's Brunch. There are three big reasons why Mama's is such a consistently popular place.\n\nReason Numero Uno: THE MONTE CRISTO\nThe Monte Cristo is the crown jewel of this popular brunch place. It is basically a french toast ham and cheese sandwich served beautifully on a powder sugared plate. You can choose to bite right into the crispy exterior of the french toast and let the warm ham and cheese slowly fill into your taste buds, OR you can choose to cut the sandwich up into tiny pieces and dip them into a sweet syrup before your epic indulgence. \n\nReason Number Two: CRAB BENEDICT\nThe Dungeness Crab Benedict is so delicious that it would make Benedict Arnold come back over to the U.S. Army. It's pretty hard to turn your back on fresh-tasting crab engulfed in egg yolk and hollandaise sauce. You can betray your country Mr. Arnold, but you can't betray your tummy!\n\nReason Number Three: HYPE\nAs good as Mama's is, the wait is 2.5 hours no joke on a bloke. So if you go consistently, you must either be a very patient grasshopper or simply a bonafide hypebeast. Let's be real, we are only talking about breakfast food. I don't care how organic the eggs are or how much powdered sugar they put on the plate, no brunch should be worth waiting 2.5 hours for under the heat of the blazing North Beach sun.\n\nWith that being said, I'll probably still go to Mama's if I know of a friend that hasn't been here before. It's just so famous now that I think everybody ought to go at least once and judge for themselves. But OTHERWISE, I won't be waiting for 2.5 hours here unless they're attaching a pair of Space Jams to my order of Monte Cristo.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-09-12"}, {"excerpts": ["North Beach (prosciutto benedict): ", "Skip.

While standing in line we decided to order all most of the popular dishes since we probably won't every go back due to the long wait.\n\nMonte Cristo: It's a cross between a grilled cheese sandwich and French toast served with their special jam. The jam was REALLY good.\n\nNorwegian (smoked salmon benedict): I am usually not smoked salmon kind of person since its always taste salty. However, the smoked salmon served here was fresh and tasty.\n\nNorthern Italian (omelet): It was on the saltier side but still good.\n\nNorth Beach (prosciutto benedict): Skip. it was also very salty.\n\nCorn hash benedict (I don't remember the name): It was my favorite one out of all the dishes we had.  \n\nOverall the food was good.

Got to make the trip worth it. \n\nHow can anyone not love the Monte Cristo?! Sweetness of the jam paired with the salty turkey breast, baked ham, and Harvarti cheese is already a match made in heaven. Having the entire sandwich dressed up as French Toast send this dish over the top. Dungeness Crab Benedict did not disappointed either. Perfectly poached eggs on top of a nice helping of crab and spinach. Some might think this is blasphemy, but Mama's Crab Benedict rivals Zazie's La Mer. French Toast Sampler was excellent and a great way to try their Banana Nut, Kugelhopf, and Swedish Cinnamon. Fruit was fresh and not doused in syrup, which is always a plus. The other two Benedicts were good but not memorable. \n\nNow for I passed the boring wait. First, you need a very nice, patient Buddy #1 to drive around looking for parking while you wait in line. Either that or take the bus. Second, you need Buddy #2 to wait in line with you. You can also throw in Buddy #3 to create the perfect even group of four. Once Buddy #1 has found parking, divide up into pairs - one set will stand in line, while the other explores North Beach and Chinatown. Exercise, good conversation, and great food all rolled into one trip to Mama's. \n\nWhat I recommend: \n\n-- Monte Cristo\n-- Dungeness Crab Benedict\n-- French Toast Sampler\n-- Be prepared to stand and wait. \n-- Bring a good parker, preferable one that can park up hills and in tight spaces or take the bus. \n-- Bring cash, unless you want to pay the extra $1 card charge.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I went with the North Beach benedict and shared it with my girl who ordered the Blackstone benedict.

Service was prompt, fast, and the servers were accommodating. \n\nOn to the food: I ordered (1) Dungeness Crab Benedict [fresh lump crab meat, poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise, english muffins, and grilled potatoes] - WOW, delicious, well prepared, and with ACTUAL CRAB MEAT, MMMMMMM!

We shared (3) Kugelhopf French Toast [house made Kugelhopf, dates, almonds, raisins, and maple syrup] - YUM! It was a bit dry, somewhat caky, so make sure you drizzle some maple syrup (drench it!) and it'll taste superb! And (4) Monte Cristo [turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar and gruyere cheese, and grilled potatoes] - It was more on the sweet side with the jam, but once you cut into the filling, it's \"heaven in bread\", simply \"delicious\". (5) I drank some bubbly - Ruby Grapefruit Mimosa [refreshing!], and my cousin had (6) Mama's Smoothie [bananas, berries, orange juice, yogurt, and honey] - a great combination for a light and delicious drink. \n\nThis restaurant is a \"must go\" for those who love breakfast, and brunch!

So the day before my sister arrived from Chicago, I got an email from Scoutmob with what sounded like an incredibly good deal.  I bought it and am very glad I did.\n\nFor $25 we got one order of buttermilk pancakes, 2 entrees, we had a choice of the Monte Cristo sandwich, Slim Joe burger, or a Paisano Eggs Benedict.  Also 2 specialty baked goods, choice of crumb cake or homemade bread, plus 2 drinks, choice of mimosa, Papa's punch which is made with red wine, or coffee, tea or a soft drink.  I figured this would cost over $50 without the deal.\n\nWe got there about noon on Friday and the line wasn't too long, could have been worse from what I've read here, about 45 minutes.  My sister has recently had 2 knee replacements and can not stand for very long.  I asked if we could take a chair out to the line but they wouldn't allow it, but they did allow her to sit on a chair that was just inside the back door while I waited in line.  I'm taking one star off because I thought they could have let us put that chair in the line so we could talk while waiting, we hadn't seen each other in a year.  \n\nOnce we got inside you have to wait in another line to order your food and then they direct you to a table.  It's kind of a weird system but I guess it works for them.  It seems more confusing to me.\n\nI'm not sure why they were offering this Scoutmob deal because they obviously don't need to drum up more business, especially at the height of tourist season.  Mama's must be written up in every tourist guidebook because everyone waiting in line with us was a tourist, and all were from other countries.  The woman in front of us was from Mexico and she said her friend had visited here and loved Mama's so much he waited in line twice to eat there.\n\nThe food was really good, the pancakes were the best I've ever had, really light and fluffy, melt-in-your mouth variety.  The crumb cakes were absolutely delicious also, I had chocolate which had chocolate baked in and drizzled over the top, my sister had cinnamon walnut.  I had the burger with potato salad and my sister had the Monte Cristo with coleslaw.  All of it was spectacular.  There was so much food we took home half of our sandwiches and sides so we got 4 meals out of this $25 deal, although I left a $10 tip so it really came to $35, but well worth it.\n\nI would come back bit I would come in the winter and I would arrive earlier, I'm not fond of lines even if the food is great.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-07-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I love North Beach!

The moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with a warm welcome. While we were waiting outside on a cold January morning, my wife and I looked at the menu which is posted by the door, so the moment we were seated we knew what to order. The restaurant is very busy, full of positive energy, yet the wait staff is very friendly, fast and efficient. The service was awesome and our waitress was always attentive. Most of the tables are very close to one another and it is possible that the couple beside you can hear your conversation. The decibel level can be high because the restaurant is packed. \n\nI ordered the eggs Benedict and they were just amazing. However, the highlight of my meal was the french toast sampler. As Adam Richman from \"Man Vs. Food\" would say, 'Oh my goodness, Oh my goodness!' or Guy Fieri from \"Diner, Drive-in, & Dives\" would say, 'money!' The chocolate cinnamon swirl french toast melts in your mouth and it was awesome, but I suggest the sampler, because you get the best of all. Furthermore, the side of strawberry jam on the table is amazing! The staff @ Mama's know their stuff, baby. \n\nHere is my advice: Before parking your car, have someone wait in line because it can be very, very long. Parking can be a challenge in North Beach, so I suggest taking public transportation or bring your patience with you (anyway your spouse, significant other, or friend will still be waiting in line when you do find a spot). Before entering the restaurant, browse at the menu outside the door before you enter. The line is extremely long on Sundays, so I suggest dining @ Mama's on weekday's, except on Mondays because they're closed. Just be sure to bring your appetite with you. \n\nI love this place for many reasons: friendly staff, great service, moderately priced, and most importantly is the food.

Once you're in, you'll have to wait in line again to order (it goes much faster though).  This is where the torture starts.  While waiting, you're forced to watch the chefs prepare all the amazing looking breakfast dishes that they offer.  They've also strategically placed the coffee cakes and other goodies in plain view.  Talk about  indecision.  \n\nUltimately, I went with the Rancheros (the Banana French Toast looked mighty tempting though).  It was delicious, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  The coffee here isn't fantastic, but it's not bad either.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nThe service here is friendly, welcoming, and laid back...which seemed to be the case for all the places I visited in San Francisco.

IS NOT A TOURIST TO SAN FRANCISCO, I AM A SF RESIDENT FOR OVER A DECADE WHO HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DINING ALL OVER THE BAY AREA. \n\nWARNING: If you read this you'll be compelled to wage an all-hands campaign to revise, revoke, re-edit and break rank with any guidebook, website, blog or public record of any kind that recommends dining at... Mama's in North Beach. \n\nThis place sucks, and it's not worth the wait AT ALL. Other reviewers refer to the scores who flock to Mama's as lemmings and victims of clever marketing. I couldn't agree more. Once I checked out other single star reviews of this joint, I was further appalled at how Mama's treats customers--\"Moldy french toast?\" that review was classic. Anyway, here's another outrage to add to Mama's list of spurned customers and embarrassing customer service:\n\nMidweek the wait was still an hour from when I stepped on the line OUTSIDE to sitting down at my table inside. And, what's with the SECOND line inside the restaurant? You place your order with a cashier and PAY (cash only) without even the privilege of sitting down or taking a sip of water. ****What a great way to \"trap\" customers in the restaurant while you continue to wait standing inside to sit down at your table. And HOW CLEVER that they only take cash and they give you NO RECEIPT showing what you paid for and ordered!\n\nMeanwhile, there I stood at the front of the big inside line with another single diner like neglected livestock in a very crowded high traffic area-- WTF??!! People squeezing past every few seconds. What rocket-scientist thought of this system? It doesn't make anyone feel welcomed or special. You immediately feel like just another tourist, and warm body in the pursuit of profit. It didn't take long for me to figure how their system totally benefits the owners, see **** above.\n\nI repeat...WTF???!!!! \n\nWhat's even more sad. With this assembly line dining experience deflects, negates, amputates any poetry from the customer service experience. But, again, I don't think Mama's cares about customer service...\n\nAfter another 10-15 minutes of standing and waiting, a 'host' approaches me and the other single diner, \"Do you two want to share a table?\" Again, WTF???!!!! That kind of instant chumminess might work in a more loving atmosphere but as I've now waited ages the last thing I want to do it make awkward conversation with a stranger who is obviously just as frustrated as I. The host is noticeably pissed when I say, no, I'd rather not do that, and once my table is ready he practically yells at me to sit down.\n\nI sit down--more waiting. I even waited for ice water. YET, they have at least 4 people working the floor at a place that can serve only about 40-50 people at a time? Again-- WTF??!! Finally, my omelet arrives, and you know what, I'm so over this place that I don't even want to look at the indifferent host and the tourists who are shoveling food down hoping to justify the ridiculous wait.\n\n\"How are you?\" said the server smiling sweetly. Too little, too late. I took my food to go and ate in the park. By the way, when they packed up my food, they gave me a small baby fork! Hello??????? And, no jam. WTF????!!! I swear, this fork was like a golf pencil with tiny little tines--how am I supposed to eat a crab omelet with that thing??? WTF???!!! Their response, \"We don't have \"real forks\" right now... \"\n\n\"I'll give the place 2 stars,\" I said, \"if the food is out of this world.\" NOT!! The eggs on the omelet were not seasoned at all, too much avocado and not enough cheese inside, potatoes also very little seasoning, tomatoes--even during high tomato season in SF--flavorless&cheap!\n\nBland, pedestrian, predictable...Read all of the single and double star reviews of this place--they all attest that the food is very, very, very commonplace... similar and better can be found all over the city. They had a Sysco Food Supplier calendar hanging next to the register-- so you do that math. If you want a great brunch try The Butler and the Chef Cafe in South Beach, Foreign Cinema in the Mission, Brenda's French Soul Food in the T-loin--that place always has a line, but their beignets, shrimp and the Hangtown Fry are totally worth every second.\n\nMAMA's in North Beach aka MAMA's on Washington is PURE EVIL...

The line was less long than usual so we examined the menu and immediately recoiled at the $18.50 shrimp and dungeoness crab omelet options.  \n\nMy first thought was \"WTF!

They are always heavily laden with seafood, (to compensate for the outrageous pricing), and they are often watery and downright fishy, and/or rich and overpowering.  \n\nTo top it off, the fact that they would dumb-down precious dungeoness crab by wrapping it in egg and cheese earns them the douchebag award in my book.  That is on par with ordering a Knob Creek bourbon and mixing it with Diet Dr. Pepper.\n\nMy boyfriend tried the shrimp omelet and was highly dissatisfied.  (See above said reasons why seafood omelets do not work) He was also expecting prawns and instead the omelet was over-filled with baby sweet shrimp.  \n\nI thought I would keep it safe and order the proscuitto benedict, which was one of the few other items on the menu that is inarguably difficult to fk up.

One opened up and we were directed to seat ourselves. The drinks we ordered were unceremoniously dropped off at our table.

A bowl of fruit was brought -- along with a bill that was expected to be paid upon receipt, before our main meal was brought. This was a real put-off.  When our food did arrive, it was luke warm. At this point  - now an hour and twenty minutes into the ordeal - we did not have the patience to send it back.  I had Florentine Benedict and my husband had the Crab Benedict. Both were pretty much unacceptable. The Hollandaise sauce tasted like yellow-colored paste - not a even a hint of tangy lemon or and echo of rich butter to be found anywhere on the plate. Honestly, I am an average home cook and I can create a better Hollandaise from scratch at home. I was inclined to scribble down my recipe on a napkin and hand it to the cook. \nTruly, I felt embarrassed for them for what was supposed to be \"the best breakfast in town.\" The poached eggs were overcooked so that the yolks were not runny, but chalky-cooked.

I bought it and am very glad I did.\n\nFor $25 we got one order of buttermilk pancakes, 2 entrees, we had a choice of the Monte Cristo sandwich, Slim Joe burger, or a Paisano Eggs Benedict.

Mama's must be written up in every tourist guidebook because everyone waiting in line with us was a tourist, and all were from other countries.  The woman in front of us was from Mexico and she said her friend had visited here and loved Mama's so much he waited in line twice to eat there.\n\nThe food was really good, the pancakes were the best I've ever had, really light and fluffy, melt-in-your mouth variety.

I had the burger with potato salad and my sister had the Monte Cristo with coleslaw.  All of it was spectacular.

I assure you, it's worth it. The place itself is quite small and the seating is limited, but it has a very cozy and relaxed atmosphere. That being said, I've never felt like I needed to rush through my meal to make room for the crowd outside waiting to be seated. The servers are always polite and I've always had a good dining experience there.\n\nNow about the food. There are so many things to choose from on the menu, so even though I've been here many times, I always have something new to try. One of their most popular dishes has got to be the Monte Cristo. They are triangular pieces of bread stuffed with ham, cheese, and turkey, battered in egg, grilled, and served with homemade jam. It's absolutely delicious!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something sweet, their french toasts are a great option. They really are very tasty (writing this review is making me crave for them right now)! If it's your first time here, I suggest you try their french toast sampler. This typically includes banana nut, cranberry orange walnut, and Swedish cinnamon french toast, but it depends on what breads they have available that day. The french toast is topped with a generous amount of fresh fruits and dusted off with powdered sugar. It's perfection on a plate.\n\nTheir eggs benedicts are delicious as well. They have a dungeness crab benedict on their specialty menu and what I love about it is that they don't skimp on the crab. It's a bit more pricey than the other dishes but you do get what you pay for. I've also tried the Paisano benedict, which has pancetta and grilled peppers in it.

Debit card/cash only though.\n\nI got an order of the Norwegian eggs benedict (smoked salmon) and it was off the charts good!! That egg was phenomenal. The yolk just oozing out right after I took a stab at it...it was delicious to say the least. The English muffin was properly toasted and the Hollandaise sauce was perfect. I'm salivating just thinking about it. We also got an order of the famous Monte Cristo and it was fantastic. Everything about it..the presentation, taste, jam....all went perfectly together. It comes loaded with turkey, ham and cheese. My favorite part was the jam. Count me in for anything homemade.\n\nAre you looking for a delicious, old-school brunch spot?

I got the our famous monte cristo. I was enjoying it until I pulled out a 1 1/12 inch white hair from the cheesy part of my sandwich. I was so saddened to not have been able to finish my meal. Our waitress immediately offered to bring another plate or refund my meal. I opted to refund my meal as I was almost done with my plate anyhow. The fresh squeeze orange juice was good too but again nothing I'd have to come back for. My 9yr old picky eater ordered a large bowl of fruit (small was $7.95 and large was a dollar or two more, about $10?) and she mostly enjoyed it but the strawberries were a little unripe and too tart for her liking. For the cost, you'd think the serving size or taste would make up for it but it just didn't. It was just strawberries, cantaloupe, honey dew melon and pineapple. No blueberries! We came at 11:53a and got in to order in 45 min. But then waited another 30min for our food to come out. The big guy in a niners beanie and white t shirt was seen outside sitting on the next door pavement or steps smoking a cigarette. When he took or order he had no smile, no enthusiasm, and no sense of humor and looked really grungy.  I want to even say he seemed a bit hungover or just out of it. He had the \"why am I here right now\" type of look. I don't normally care about big, not happy type of people taking my orders but I'm slowly realizing it does make a difference in the dining experience with happy vs not so happy employees. Overall, I would come back but only with people who \"have to\" come to try this establishment. On my own though, I wouldn't bother.

The poached eggs from the eggs benedict were the most perfect poached eggs I've ever eaten in my life. THEY WERE PERFECTION ON A PLATE.\n\n2. The hollandaise sauce on these egg benedicts were soo good. You can tell right away it's not going to be too rich due the color of the sauce. If it's too yellow, it's too rich and overwhelming. But the light yellow hollandaise sauce was amazing and I finished all of it.\n\n3. I normally don't like french toast, but these were pretty good. Also, it was the most prettiest plate I have ever seen in my life. I MEAN LOOK AT THE COLORS OF THAT PLATE.\n\n4. MONTEEEEEEEEEE CRISTOOOOOOOOOO. need i say more? This isn't your average monte cristo. It's not oily at all. Its crispy on the outside and gooey and cheesy on the inside. And that raspberry jam it comes with oh my god. Remember this is an ALL DAY food item so you can order this for breakfast too! I wish I would have just ordered this as my main dish. Damn it was good. \n\n5.

I had the Norwegian Benedict (smoked salmon) and my boyfriend had the corned beef hash Benedict. Both dishes were good but I think my smoked salmon was a little over cooked. Both plates went for about $13.75 each and the wtf moment for me was our small orange juices that went for $3.50 each, I literally finished that thing in 5 gulps! It was like an oversized shot glass. Too pricey if you ask me. Also, wear a sweater if you plan on going here, they have the entrance  doors open as well as multiple fans blowing full speed down on you. It gets chilly and cools the food down pretty quick.

From there, you're seated at your table.\n\nSomehow one of my friends brought up the fact that my birthday is next week and the guy asked me if I wanted the restaurant to sing me Happy Birthday. I shrugged it off and the guy announced my birthday and indeed got the whole restaurant to sing me Happy Birthday. Haha.\n\nHere's the rundown of the food and drinks:\n\n1. Orange Juice - looked like fresh squeezed OJ and my friends seemed happy with it!\n2. Monte Cristo Sandwich - pretty good rendition of the classic sandwich. Not as heavily fried as the one from Disneyland, but that's probably a good thing. They serve it with a jam that tastes homemade. The sandwich itself probably could use some more filling since I didn't really taste any of the ham or cheese.\n3. Crab Benedict - they're doing it right. It's one of the pricier options, but they put a fair amount of crab under a buttered english muffin, topped with a perfectly cooked poached egg, and a rich hollandaise sauce. It was so filling I couldn't finish the entire english muffin.\n4. French Toast Sampler - three different pieces of bread dipped in an egg batter and cooked to perfection. It's topped with sliced bananas, strawberries, and blueberries. The cranberry orange walnut bread was probably my favorite. Nice and sweet. The banana bread was also nice, but quite dense to be made into french toast. The Swedish cinnamon bread was just okay, with a slight cinnamon flavor, but not much else.\n\nOther items that looked pretty good were the omelets and the bacon (nice thick cut strips).\n\nThe service was excellent and the food was tasty and rather filling.

Also tacked on the Smoked Salmon Benedict and Eggs Florentine. I figured that starving for an hour equals ordering more worth. Got to make the trip worth it. \n\nHow can anyone not love the Monte Cristo?! Sweetness of the jam paired with the salty turkey breast, baked ham, and Harvarti cheese is already a match made in heaven. Having the entire sandwich dressed up as French Toast send this dish over the top. Dungeness Crab Benedict did not disappointed either. Perfectly poached eggs on top of a nice helping of crab and spinach. Some might think this is blasphemy, but Mama's Crab Benedict rivals Zazie's La Mer. French Toast Sampler was excellent and a great way to try their Banana Nut, Kugelhopf, and Swedish Cinnamon. Fruit was fresh and not doused in syrup, which is always a plus.

I don't want to spoil any more, but it's too amazing not to talk about it.  It looks like a boring, fat piece of french toast.  But inside.. seriously..

Abigail H.", "review": "I'm kinda in the 3.5 Stars range...\n\nTook a 1 1/2 trip with a friend to Mama's based on all the reviews. It was a Friday afternoon, the sun was shinin' the sky was a beautiful blue and the birds were chirpin'... Well, maybe no chirping birds, but we did run into a couple of gangsta pigeons as we were walking out of the Montgomery Street BART Station...Then we walked 20 minutes to get to Mama's, saying to ourselves, \"this is gonna so great, so worth the trip.\" \n\nGot to Mama's. Saw a line. Still telling each other, \"this is going to be great..\"  I kept telling myself it will be just a few minutes 'til I eating some of Mama's food. I got excited as we neared the door, there was even a menu on the window, so we occupied our time thinking about what to order. We decided on the Dungeness Crab Benedict (#1), Crab Omelette (#4, not #5), and the French Toast Sampler (#10).\n\nWe were *finally* granted access into the little cafe. And guess what..?  We had to wait in yet another line! Geez... well can't turn back now since we already survived a 55+ minute wait outside. The line inside was shorter, it was only about 15 minutes. You have to wait in line to order and pay for your food. NOTE: it is CASH or DEBIT only! There's a $1 fee if you use your debit card.  Our bill ended up at $57.20.. The reason for the line is because we're waiting on other diners to get up and free up the tables. Man, I was so upset I saw some peeps who were already done eating, still seating down texting on their cell phones.. Seriously, get up and go so the rest of us can eat some tasty Mama's food. Geez... \n\nWell, we finally sat down and had to wait again for our food to arrive. I'm sure this time it was only like 5 to 10 minutes, but we were so hungry it felt like forever.. sigh.... Finally, the waiter brings 2 dishes out. The crab benedict and the crab omelette. We immediately split our plate half-and-half. Based on the Yelp review I immediately opted to fork over some crab benedict into my mouth...and it. was. a. little..... disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it was good but not *that* good, definitely not based on all the hooplah I read about on yelp. No worries though, it's still pretty good, just nothing special. Next I tried the crab omelette.. now, that. was. the...... bomb.com!!!! It was sooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooood, like slap yo' Mama good! Yum!!! It's like I couldn't eat it fast enough, hmmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm goooood! ; ))  \n\nThey kinda skimped on the crab on the benedict, but the omelette was filled with crab, it was so good! I was full and I still wanted more of that omelette. However, some of the homestyle fries were kinda burnt, not good! Next, they brought the french toast sampler. There were 3 types--the Swedish french toast, the banana nut, and the low-fat apple yogurt cinnamon. There were all good. I didn't really care too much for the banana nut bread french toast, it was a little dry for me, but I put the homemade jam on it and it helped! I loved the Swedish cinnamon and the apple yogurt cinnamon, I could hardly believe it was low-fat!\n\nBottom line, everything was pretty good. I'm glad I went, I think it was worth the wait. I'll be back to try more items on the menu, but if the line isn't so long.\n\n\nLast TIP:  The cafe closes at 3:00, if you get there like 2:00-ish, there's barely any wait! We left like 2:15PM and there was no wait at all! If only wee had planned our trip better lol! (But then, again it may have just been that one time). I have to come back again to give you a better sense of things. But do believe when I (and a lot of yelpers) say that it is worth the hour wait!

We probably waited about 15-20 minutes outside and then another 15 minutes inside (yes, you have to wait again when you get inside). \n\nHow this place works is when you get inside, you get to watch the food preparation (just beware, this may change your mind on what you originally wanted because everything looks soooo good!!) and then finally it's your turn to order. You also pay at the cashier and then you will be seated as soon as a table that can accommodate your party opens up.  It's a short wait from there on for your food. \n\nJenny K. got the dungeness crab benedict and I got the swedish cinnamon french toast. OMG. Both were sooooo good and so worth the wait. I really do wish the place was a lot bigger to accommodate more people at a given time since there's ALWAYS a long line. But don't let the long line scare you.

I say too small cause on a Friday around 11:30am when people should be working, this isn't LA where people don't work, we were standing behind about 30 people outside of Mama's.  We were told it's like this everyday and weekends are even worse.  Mama's line is like nothing I've ever seen (Pink's in LA is the closest).  While most restauants have a waiting list or people just hanging artound outside, at Mama's the line starts inside the restaruant at the register and travels up the block elementary school style, one person behind the other.  The employees regulate how many people come inside at a time and if you leave the line you're screwed, you've lost your place.  Standing there you wonder if Mama's is worth it?

I like Jesse's obsession just as much, but they don't have \"Those\" kinda girls at Mama's.

The French Toast Sampler was fantastic, two of the three.  What was cool about their french toast was they make it with their sweet breads and cakes. (The basket of breads photo is what they use to make the french toast) One piece was banana nut topped with fresh bananas, swedish cinnamon topped with berries and another was cranberry orange walnut, which I could have done without (just my personal taste).  The banana nut and the swedish cinnamon was soo sweet and tasty I didn't even need syrup which is like Jesse James and Tiger Woods not needing sluts.\n\nBy the end of my french toast rampage I was stuffed.  I had also eaten the last bites of both of the Benedicts.  I stand to see good food go to waste, especially not after waiting 40 minutes in line.  But we were still left with the Cinnamon Sour Cream Walnut bread.  My friend and my cousin were waving the white flag.  BITCHES!  But I still had the motivation and will to at least try these heavenly sweet pieces of decadence.  I dove in and it was everyting every coffee cake in every coffee shop around the world tries to be.  It was sweet but not too sweet, spiced but not too much cinnamon, and soo moist I thought it was attracted to me.

No line means I'm there, otherwise SF offers too much good food to be standing in a line.

Wonderful wonderful place that any short visit to San Francisco is incomplete without. Mama's is truly a top tier place to go to for a brunch and an icon to the city and North Beach. First thing's first, if you're planning on coming here, plan on a solid wait (30 minutes to an hour, sometimes even more). It's a really small space and they can only fit so many people at once. If you're lucky and show up a tad before closing (3 pm) you might only have a 20ish minute wait, otherwise showing up that late could risk being just short of the cut off. Anyways once you've trekked your way inside, there's another smaller line but then you can use this time to make the ultimatum between two items or take in the homely interior. Mama's also has amazing little pastries, but they only make one batch of each per day so you're gonna have to come a little earlier and pray that they haven't ran out of carrot cake (I've only been lucky enough to have this once throughout my multiple visits). Be sure to also sample some of their freshly squeezed orange juice or grapefruit juice. You'll be seated shortly after ordering by one of the very friendly and conversational servers and you can even spot the owner lurking around on occasion. The entire place just makes you feel like you're in a classic mama's place, so home-like and cozy. The food doesn't take too long to come out but it feels like years after all the collective waiting and it definitely amplifies the taste a little, but it's still the highest of quality regardless. As good as the eggs benedict are, I somehow always end up ordering french toast. The kugelhopf and chocolate cinnamon french toasts are both to die for. So sweet, so soft, and so satiating. It enough to leave you full but still surmountable, you don't have to be a competitive eater to clean your plate here.

Sure the long is wait and finding parking is a headache but if you come with the right mindset, Mama's is totally worth trying at least once. \n\nFor years, I had been driving past this brunch locale wondering why the line is out the door. Finally, I committed, took the plunge, and waited like the many before me to try their most popular dishes. Yes, you guessed it -- Dungeness Crab Benedict, French Toast Sampler, and the Monte Cristo. Also tacked on the Smoked Salmon Benedict and Eggs Florentine. I figured that starving for an hour equals ordering more worth. Got to make the trip worth it. \n\nHow can anyone not love the Monte Cristo?! Sweetness of the jam paired with the salty turkey breast, baked ham, and Harvarti cheese is already a match made in heaven. Having the entire sandwich dressed up as French Toast send this dish over the top. Dungeness Crab Benedict did not disappointed either. Perfectly poached eggs on top of a nice helping of crab and spinach. Some might think this is blasphemy, but Mama's Crab Benedict rivals Zazie's La Mer. French Toast Sampler was excellent and a great way to try their Banana Nut, Kugelhopf, and Swedish Cinnamon. Fruit was fresh and not doused in syrup, which is always a plus. The other two Benedicts were good but not memorable. \n\nNow for I passed the boring wait. First, you need a very nice, patient Buddy #1 to drive around looking for parking while you wait in line. Either that or take the bus. Second, you need Buddy #2 to wait in line with you. You can also throw in Buddy #3 to create the perfect even group of four. Once Buddy #1 has found parking, divide up into pairs - one set will stand in line, while the other explores North Beach and Chinatown. Exercise, good conversation, and great food all rolled into one trip to Mama's. \n\nWhat I recommend: \n\n-- Monte Cristo\n-- Dungeness Crab Benedict\n-- French Toast Sampler\n-- Be prepared to stand and wait. \n-- Bring a good parker, preferable one that can park up hills and in tight spaces or take the bus. \n-- Bring cash, unless you want to pay the extra $1 card charge.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Kugelhopf - $7.95\n-Brioche french toast.

Right across the street from Washington Square Park in North Beach, sits Mama's, a rather small establishment known for their \"to die for\" breakfast. I planned today to brunch with my cousin, and had her wait in line while I Barted in. She wrote me a text, \"hurry, where are you, there's no line, oh wait, it was hiding,it is long\".\n\nThe line wasn't terrible, but the cold weather certainly made it seem like \"forever\". The longest I have ever waited for food was in New York, SoHo: Dominque Ansel's Cronut - three hours in line was certainly \"forever\". My cousin and I, as well as other patient guests, stared inside as people ate and we drooled for their food. We came hungry! I arrived at 9:30AM and we were let inside to the warmth at around 11. Be sure to come prepared, because there are no menus at the tables. Upon entering the restaurant, you are directed to the registers, and once you order, you will then be seated. It is very organized! The one let down, which will not be reflected in the star rating, is the unavailability for credit card transactions, which was startling because it is the new age. What's interesting is that, I called ahead to make sure what forms of payments they take, though they take debit cards, credit cards are of another story. I think if an establishment is able to process debit cards, credit cards are no different (maybe with a small fee, but I think it's necessary). Service was prompt, fast, and the servers were accommodating. \n\nOn to the food: I ordered (1) Dungeness Crab Benedict [fresh lump crab meat, poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise, english muffins, and grilled potatoes] - WOW, delicious, well prepared, and with ACTUAL CRAB MEAT, MMMMMMM!

We shared (3) Kugelhopf French Toast [house made Kugelhopf, dates, almonds, raisins, and maple syrup] - YUM!

Good thing I had anticipated this and grabbed a custard bun at a Chinese bakery on my way here!\n\nTIP 2: If you are here for the French toast and have a hard time deciding on which type to get, just get one of everything! You get a choice of any 3 if you order the Sampler and can add more for an additional price.\n\nKnowing that we would not likely return due to the wait, my friend and I wanted to cram in 4 dishes (literally) during this visit - 2 x French toast, pancakes, and an omelette. Our server warned us it was a lot of food for two people, (if I had a penny every time I heard that... well, I still wouldn't be rich, but I'd have a lot of pennies!) so we settled on an augmented French toast Sampler, omelette, and a side of buttermilk pancake instead.\n\nFor the FRENCH TOAST SAMPLER (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=yvneqNYV2HY6-r_KvZTq9g) we had the standard banana nut, cranberry-orange walnut, and Swedish cinnamon, but we also added the kugelhopf, chocolate cinnamon, and fat-free apple yogurt cinnamon (cause you know, we're watching our figures). The BANANA NUT and CRANBERRY-ORANGE WALNUT were just basically banana bread and cranberry-orange loaf - there wasn't really anything \"French toast\" about them. The SWEDISH CINNAMON was very nutmeg-y and the APPLE YOGURT CINNAMON wasn't very memorable. My favourites were the KUGELHOPF (the brioche bread makes a big difference and this had the best egg batter \"crust\") and the CHOCOLATE CINNAMON (great with the side of chocolate sauce). All of them could've been moister though.\n\nWe got the Mama's Children's Favorite OMELETTE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=ns3tMMIpWsZWSS-L7Aa-tw) - mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, and jack cheese, served with home fries and sourdough toast. The omelette itself was pretty good and the home fries were decent, but my favourite part of the dish was the sourdough toast! Lightly buttered, it was simply scrumptious with the delectable homemade OLLALIEBERRY! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=pAI-DXUoanNioABKH_tDAQ)\n\nThe BUTTERMILK PANCAKE was also delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=m1eLpd2H-8m6B1laOqZIPw). Incredibly fluffy texture with a nicely browned \"crust\". There was a hint of saltiness (from the butter?) that went perfectly with the sweetness of the syrup.\n\nAs for the service, I was very impressed - fast, efficient, and so friendly (especially considering how busy and hectic this place gets).\n\nMama's is a place I would go to *once* - I'm glad I can say that I've been here but even gladder that I've tried everything I wanted to so that I'll never have to wait in that line again!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-15"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the dungeness crab eggs benedict with spinach, short stack of Kugelhopf frech toasts, and OJ.

Figured it was just the wrong day so we said we'd come back another day when it wasn't so busy.  I decided to do some research and then realized that a long wait is to be expected at good ol' Mama's - due to all of the media coverage it's delectable food has received.

Friends and I had just finished volunteering during an early morning shift in SF and we were looking for a place to grab breakfast; saw Mama's on Yelp--the comforting name of \"mama\" wooed us to adventure forth into SF and find out about Mama's!\n\nParking was definitely a bit difficult since it's SF and all, but there are ample streets all around the place so you're bound to find a place at some point. \n\nThe line is just as bad as the reviews say they are. We got there around 9:30 and got in around 11:15 a.m. Definitely a place you don't want to go to on a busy day--treat Mama's as luxury for leisurely days. The line was insane, but go with a group of friends and time passes by pretty quickly. One slight downside is that once you get in, you wait in yet another line--but that at least gives you the time you need to figure out your orders and pay! By the way, cash only!\n\nWe got a total of four dishes and split them for maximum joy. We ordered:\n\nChocolate Cinnamon French Toast: Heaven. Besides its beautiful presentation--chocolate drizzled on the plate and toast and garnished with fresh fruits, this was the best french toast I've ever had! Super soft and chocolately. They give you some syrup but the flavor is rich enough that you won't need it.\n\nMonte Cristo: Basically a grilled cheese but fancier and with ham embedded. They serve this with a salad--we got a Spring Salad, pretty normal, and their homemade jam! You MUST try their jam! There's a jar on the table so even if you don't get a meal with the jam, definitely give it a shot! It's a strawberry flavor and despite the sweet/salty combo, it compliments the Monte Cristo quite well! Soft and delish. I wouldn't actually be able to eat the whole thing though since it could be overwhelming, so sharing is a great option.\n\nSalmon Smoked Eggs: I will never eat normal scrambled eggs again. Coming from an Asian family, I've always been really picky about my eggs in American dining because they always feel undercooked to me. These eggs were perfectly cooked and had smoked salmon! How can you not like smoked salmon?! Phenomenal. It comes with a bagel and cream cheese, although I'd personally suggest you slather their jam on your bagel instead. :)\n\nMama's Children's Favorite Omelette: Meh. I'm not an omlette person. Friends got it cause they liked it. I'm an egg person. I can say that the egg is pretty well cooked though? Also comes with a slice of sourdough bread--SLATHER THE JAM. THE JAM IS GREAT!\n\nMama's Smoothies: Definitely a very healthy smoothie with fresh ingredients. Not exactly worth the five dollars though, but it's decent! Berries, orange juice, yogurt and honey!\n\nWaiters are extremely nice and the decor of the restaurant has this great homey feel. They decorate the place with all the awards they've gotten and cute very vintage photos and posters and it honestly does feel like home. Go with friends so you can sample more!

That is the only reason I endured circling around the area for 40 min looking for street parking, only to pay to park in a parking lot near chinatown, and then proceed to wait outside Mama's for another hour and 20 minutes. \n\nAfter waiting a total of 2 hours, we finally stepped into the quaint cafe furnished with plenty of homey knick knacks that you would find in your grandma's kitchen or living room. I adored the fresh flowers at each table and really appreciated the openness of the cafe. There were large windows that allowed plenty of natural lighting to spill through and light up the restaurant. \n\nInstead of being seated first, we were directed to order at the window first and then were allowed to pick from any open tables. We ordered the blackstone eggs benedict and the french toast sampler. After doing extensive yelping, it seemed like I'd be missing out on not trying the chocolate cinnamon french toast so I asked them to sub the regular cinnamon brioche for the chocolate cinnamon and they were happy to accommodate at no extra cost :) \n\nMama hit my major sweet tooth right on the spot with her delicious french toast. What makes this the best french toast I've ever had is the ridiculously flavorful slices of brioche. Each slice was moist, packed with warm spices, and the cranberry orange and banana nut brioche were studded with walnuts. The shining star of the show had to be the cinnamon french toast. It had the best texture, lightness, and overall flavor. The cinnamon brioche was the best bread for soaking up the french toast egg mixture (in the end the chocolate didn't add much). The banana bread was also delicious but slightly denser. The cranberry orange french toast was my least favorite but still better than any I've tried. \n\nDunk the french toast in syrup or do yourself a flavor and slather on a bit of the blackberry jam sitting innocently on your table. It wasn't too sweet and had a very bright berry flavor (I'd imagine it'd go amazing with a meyer lemon scone mmm). If you're not too careful, you could end up chugging the whole jar on the spot. \n\nThe eggs benedict were pretty customary, but too salty for my taste. I'm not much of a savory breakfast person so I'm biased but my friend said they were good, not amazing. We also ordered the old fashioned bar and a slice of carrot cake to go. The carrot cake fell short for me because it wasn't exceptional in any way and didn't have a cream cheese frosting but a rather plain buttercream frosting. The old fashioned was just average for me as well. It had an ok crumb topping but not really worth trying. \n\nWe received excellent and friendly service from everyone including the busboys! I never felt rushed during the meal and our water glasses were always filled. A busser was even kind enough to box my food and pack up some jam for me :) \n\nThe price for breakfast was fairly reasonable, about $10 or so a plate. However, the price for pastries that didn't blow my mind was somewhat stiff. \n\nFinal verdict: \nAll you french toast fanatics out there, this will now be our official congregation spot, 10 minutes or 2 hours, rain or shine. Everyone else, not really worth waiting more than 30 minutes in line for! I would also save my money for pastries elsewhere. Heads up, Mama's only takes debit cards, no credit!!!\n\nIf Mama's didn't have such a long wait I would come back for brunch every time I was in the city!\n\nP.S.

This is amazing!! spinich, tomotal, mushrooms, and avocado may just be one of the BEST benedict I've had here or in general. Even though I said its the best for me, one plate is not satisfying for a 2 hour wait. \n\nBlackstone Benedict:\nIt has crispy bacon and tomaton topped with two poached eggs. It was okay... wasn't that good actually. just tasted like bacon egg and tomoato because the ingredients didn't really like blend and more like you taste them individually. If you want bacon I recommend just getting a side of bacon.\n\nMonte Cristo:\nI myself am not a fan of it at all. The reason though is probably because I don't like grilled cheese sandwiches and this somewhat tasted like it. There ham and cheese in the middle and it's cooked kind of like a french toast. Yes it's salty not sweet, however they give you homemade jam so that you can dip into it. The jam was delicious and I would recommend getting toast on the side to eat with it. I think it's weird to have salty and sweet together like that so I didn't enjoy the combination, but that's me not you so you should try it still.\n\nChocolate Cinnamon French Toast:\nFrench Toast has always been a favorite part of my breakfasts.

This was yummy except the salmon seems to be a bit too salty for my liking and the sauce is slightly heavy. \n\nSwedish cinnamon French Toast with berries:\nI think this is quite similar to the CCFT but maybe the different timing that I ate it at made a difference because I actually thought this was delicious.

Wonderful wonderful place that any short visit to San Francisco is incomplete without. Mama's is truly a top tier place to go to for a brunch and an icon to the city and North Beach. First thing's first, if you're planning on coming here, plan on a solid wait (30 minutes to an hour, sometimes even more). It's a really small space and they can only fit so many people at once. If you're lucky and show up a tad before closing (3 pm) you might only have a 20ish minute wait, otherwise showing up that late could risk being just short of the cut off. Anyways once you've trekked your way inside, there's another smaller line but then you can use this time to make the ultimatum between two items or take in the homely interior. Mama's also has amazing little pastries, but they only make one batch of each per day so you're gonna have to come a little earlier and pray that they haven't ran out of carrot cake (I've only been lucky enough to have this once throughout my multiple visits). Be sure to also sample some of their freshly squeezed orange juice or grapefruit juice. You'll be seated shortly after ordering by one of the very friendly and conversational servers and you can even spot the owner lurking around on occasion. The entire place just makes you feel like you're in a classic mama's place, so home-like and cozy. The food doesn't take too long to come out but it feels like years after all the collective waiting and it definitely amplifies the taste a little, but it's still the highest of quality regardless.

French toast and the like. She once messaged me: \"Do you dip or soak when you cook French toast?\" It turns out we both dip. Over the past few years, we've traded some cooking tips and gone on some culinary Yelp adventures. \n\nWhen her birthday rolled around this year, there was only one place she wanted to go: Mama's. With over two thousand reviews on Yelp and a 4 star average, Mama's is *the* place to go for breakfast or brunch.\n\nNow I'm not the type of girl who likes to wait in line for food. I just don't. I can think of so many other things I'd rather do than wait to be seated. But I'll do it for a friend in honor of her birthday. And we tried to minimize the wait by going on a weekday. There still was a surprisingly huge line (please note that pics in this review aren't mine, I just link to them from other fabulous Yelpers.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#OawUK99pZ3IBleoLxk7nfQ  I found it shocking. And even more stunning was seeing some people wait with kids for over an hour. I can imagine doing that with a foodie adult friend, but never an impatient child (like me or my son). \n\nAnyway, birthdays are special, so we waited. And tag-teamed out of line a couple of times to investigate local bakeries and make a coffee run. There was plenty of time for that.\n\nWhen we finally got inside, we decided to go nuts and order a lot of food, because we wouldn't likely return and put up with the wait ever again. So we'd try whatever we wanted on this one special visit.\n\nWe ordered (note photos are not mine):\n\n* French Toast Sampler - House Baked Bread made with Cranberries, Fresh Orange Juice and Walnuts battered in Egg Whites, Chocolate Cinnamon French Toast, and Banana Bread French Toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#qpaVLJLdxdVkhHrWoooTVA\n\n* Pan Dore - Slices of Sourdough Baguette with Saut\u00e9ed Apples in Lemon Butter Sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#v-qevWmOqGFBPzVaUXO2sA\n\n* Blueberry Pancakes - Blueberries inside the fluffy pancakes and out http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#hRjUmhJhxN4PaZDEg_jyxQ\n\n* Vegetarian Eggs Benedict - Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms, Avocado, Baby Spinach and Grilled Tomato http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#oo1oZHVRl93w_Mw-MyriRQ\n\n* Chocolate Crumb Cake - Warmed up and very sweet http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#vWOA05LUl46MXE91JchA5Q\n\n* Fresh Orange Juice - Super fresh and sweet\n\nIt was a carb fest of gut-busting proportions. We had plenty leftover. While the food was 5 star worthy, I have to dock a star for the wait. Unless you're into that, it makes me think about the former USSR and those poor bastards who had to wait in line for things, and thank G-d I usually don't have to. Phew.\n\nOur favorites were the Cranberry French Toast and Pan Dore (a unique dish), followed very closely by the Blueberry Pancakes. Their house-made jam was excellent as well. I wasn't crazy about the Eggs Benedict, but I liked the home fried potatoes that came with it.\n\nTo get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen. When we were there yesterday, the handle came off the faucet, so there was a definite plumbing issue to address.

It's not nice to glare at people while they eat because YOU didn't get here early enough.\n\nHaving seen Mama's featured on multiple TV shows and magazines, I knew to expect a line. It was an hour wait for us even at 9am on a Saturday (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=qUajojEM0TDUOXdGis2kwg). Good thing I had anticipated this and grabbed a custard bun at a Chinese bakery on my way here!\n\nTIP 2: If you are here for the French toast and have a hard time deciding on which type to get, just get one of everything! You get a choice of any 3 if you order the Sampler and can add more for an additional price.\n\nKnowing that we would not likely return due to the wait, my friend and I wanted to cram in 4 dishes (literally) during this visit - 2 x French toast, pancakes, and an omelette. Our server warned us it was a lot of food for two people, (if I had a penny every time I heard that... well, I still wouldn't be rich, but I'd have a lot of pennies!) so we settled on an augmented French toast Sampler, omelette, and a side of buttermilk pancake instead.\n\nFor the FRENCH TOAST SAMPLER (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=yvneqNYV2HY6-r_KvZTq9g) we had the standard banana nut, cranberry-orange walnut, and Swedish cinnamon, but we also added the kugelhopf, chocolate cinnamon, and fat-free apple yogurt cinnamon (cause you know, we're watching our figures).

My favourites were the KUGELHOPF (the brioche bread makes a big difference and this had the best egg batter \"crust\") and the CHOCOLATE CINNAMON (great with the side of chocolate sauce).

The omelette itself was pretty good and the home fries were decent, but my favourite part of the dish was the sourdough toast! Lightly buttered, it was simply scrumptious with the delectable homemade OLLALIEBERRY! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=pAI-DXUoanNioABKH_tDAQ)\n\nThe BUTTERMILK PANCAKE was also delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MvAo0hj9FXOeNL5PwBZ0fQ?select=m1eLpd2H-8m6B1laOqZIPw).

An hour and a half wait for me has to result in something out of this world.\n\nSo the routine is you stand in line outside which has its own appeal.  Monkey see monkey do.  Then a man beckons you inside in which you proceed to wait in a much smaller line, standing next to the fresh pastries, watching the cooks prepare the orders, smelling the aromas, and finally you get to the cashier where you can order what your stomach has built up desiring.  They do not take credit cards but they do take debit for an extra $1 charge.\n\nAs soon as you order, you wait only a little while more until another man directs you to your table.  I actually think their method is most efficient because while you're in line to order your food, they have time to prepare the tables.  It makes you feel like things are happening and that you're more productive even though they just put you in another line.  And after we sat down, the food only took about 5 minutes?

Nuff said. My wife and I came here on Sunday at approximately 9:20 am and we waited in line more than an hour. And yes, it was worth the wait. The moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with a warm welcome. While we were waiting outside on a cold January morning, my wife and I looked at the menu which is posted by the door, so the moment we were seated we knew what to order. The restaurant is very busy, full of positive energy, yet the wait staff is very friendly, fast and efficient. The service was awesome and our waitress was always attentive. Most of the tables are very close to one another and it is possible that the couple beside you can hear your conversation. The decibel level can be high because the restaurant is packed. \n\nI ordered the eggs Benedict and they were just amazing. However, the highlight of my meal was the french toast sampler. As Adam Richman from \"Man Vs. Food\" would say, 'Oh my goodness, Oh my goodness!' or Guy Fieri from \"Diner, Drive-in, & Dives\" would say, 'money!' The chocolate cinnamon swirl french toast melts in your mouth and it was awesome, but I suggest the sampler, because you get the best of all. Furthermore, the side of strawberry jam on the table is amazing! The staff @ Mama's know their stuff, baby. \n\nHere is my advice: Before parking your car, have someone wait in line because it can be very, very long. Parking can be a challenge in North Beach, so I suggest taking public transportation or bring your patience with you (anyway your spouse, significant other, or friend will still be waiting in line when you do find a spot). Before entering the restaurant, browse at the menu outside the door before you enter. The line is extremely long on Sundays, so I suggest dining @ Mama's on weekday's, except on Mondays because they're closed. Just be sure to bring your appetite with you. \n\nI love this place for many reasons: friendly staff, great service, moderately priced, and most importantly is the food.

Over the past few years, we've traded some cooking tips and gone on some culinary Yelp adventures. \n\nWhen her birthday rolled around this year, there was only one place she wanted to go: Mama's. With over two thousand reviews on Yelp and a 4 star average, Mama's is *the* place to go for breakfast or brunch.\n\nNow I'm not the type of girl who likes to wait in line for food. I just don't. I can think of so many other things I'd rather do than wait to be seated. But I'll do it for a friend in honor of her birthday. And we tried to minimize the wait by going on a weekday.

I can imagine doing that with a foodie adult friend, but never an impatient child (like me or my son). \n\nAnyway, birthdays are special, so we waited. And tag-teamed out of line a couple of times to investigate local bakeries and make a coffee run. There was plenty of time for that.\n\nWhen we finally got inside, we decided to go nuts and order a lot of food, because we wouldn't likely return and put up with the wait ever again.

I ordered 2 dishes: \n\nPan Dore - (2/5) french toast drenched in lemon butter. I didn't like the sour/oily combo that was a little bitter and it soaked the already thin slices of french bread to the point that they were soggy/rubbery. The bread was too thin to have a fluffy consistency and the egg mixture overwhelmed it. It tasted of fried egg basically and I regretted choosing this french toast even though it sounded so unique!\n\nMonte Cristo - (3/5)  I loved the presentation, how the meat & cheese were encased inside the batter and it was divided into 4 neat triangles. While the bread was pretty good, the cheese I had was not melted enough and tasted like Kraft cheese, which I really hate. The breast and ham were thin deli slices that they gave too little of, at least relative to the thickness of the sandwich bread. In short, what was on the inside left something to be desired. My two friends took two of the  4 triangles eagerly since it looked really good, but they were left unimpressed as well. \n\nI tried a bit of my friends' french toast sampler. The presentation was stunning like most dishes here. The fruits were a nice touch, but I usually don't pay restaurants for fresh fruit. I go to the farmer's market for those. The french toasts themselves were underwhelming. I think the best one was the banana bread, but banana bread is hard to mess up.\n\nI think their savory items are better overall from past experiences of ordering benedicts and everything involving eggs. \n\nI'm going get on the bandwagon and say that I would come here again if the line is short, simply because  Mama's is usually in such high demand and I buy into the hype and recognize a rare opportunity.  The service is always efficient at least, and it is an inviting, cozy spot to eat with warm, bistro colors.

I have no qualms about standing in line, as it's indicative of a good restaurant and something we volunteer for. \n\n1.

We got to stand in line and watch the cooks put together all the plates, which was very interesting.  They have everything down to a science and make it look easy!  \n\n3. I swapped dishes with someone else so we ordered 2 dishes and passed them back and forth.  The first dish was their apple pan dore. The sourdough bread was really good and tender, nice and thin, very moist.  I was extremely disappointed in their lemon butter sauce.  There was no citrus at all, and it mostly felt and tasted like a melted butter sauce.  There was no zing and it left the dish lacking.  The saut\u00e9ed apples were very good, still a good crunch factor but tender and a really pretty presentation with the pink skins still on. They still didn't quite finish the dish.

Once we received this, the dish turned completely different. The sour preserve helped cut the butter of the sauce and paired well with the sweet apples. This should just come with the jam because it's lackluster without it.\n\n4. The other dish was the North Coast Benedict. The prosciutto was amazing.  Tender and shredded, it was salty and piled on high. The English muffins were crisp and buttery. The biggest issue: the poached eggs were BAD. In hindsight, I should've sent them back. But we had been waiting for an hour and the restaurant was clearly busy. We went with it. The eggs were hard-poached. When you broke the yolk, they were completely solid, no runniness at all. How can I saturate my muffin when the yolk is basically hard-boiled? I admire egg poaching, as it's not something I have mastered, but for a breakfast place this was the most disappointing portion of the plate.\n\n5. Most everyone else at the table ordered the corned beef hash or corned beef benedict. The beef was good.  Tender and shredded, but it lacked the typical vivacity of corned beef I know and love. I think the emphasis on all those pickling spices and mustard seeds would've really popped this savory dish. With the egg on top, the meat just lacked life. \n\nOverall, a good breakfast place. I think the hour long wait is a bit over-hyped but I can safely say I have tried Mama's! If you're willing to wait, it's worth a try for the experience.  \n\nP.S.

The crab was fresh (as you can watch them cook while you're in line to order) and they paired it with fluffy scrambled eggs and cheese and put it all on a soft bun. It comes with their yummy home fries. \n\nI also had their fresh-squeezed orange juice, which was great! Not too sweet or too tangy and I do love fresh-squeezed!\n\nOverall the experience was great.

"], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "I'm not the first to point out that the ingredients that make up french toast, pancakes, omelettes, and eggs Benedict do not add up to $$-$$$, and yet people still pay it, and line up for about an hour prior to forking over said $$. It is delicious and when you make your own, the results usually are not restaurant quality. Even if yours are restaurant quality, it is still a pain to wash all the dishes.\nI'm not one to line up for brunch or breakfast. I'm not a morning person. So Mr. Joy had the brilliant idea to dine at Mama's close to closing time, around 3PM, in hopes that we wouldn't have to compete with the brunch crowd. We still had to wait about 40 minutes, but it was a nice day, so it wasn't too bad hanging out under the green awning. Once you step into the cozy little diner, you order at the counter where all the fresh baked goods are lined up. They only take cash or debit card.\nThe thing about Mama's is you pay before you are seated. Some leave a cash tip on the table on their way out. So when we sat down at our table, there was a $10 tip, which I handed to the waitress. What would you do if you found cash just lying around on the table? Honestly, I was tempted to use it as my own tip.\n\n$6.25 Mama's Smoothie - bananas, berries, orange juice, yogurt, honey:\nMr. Joy heard good things about the smoothie, and wanted to give it a try. It was sweet, a little thick, with some seed texture throughout, so it was not a bad smoothie. But I thought the ingredients were very simple, and easy to make with a blender, so the price is too steep for me.\n\n$12.95 Monte Cristo - roasted turkey breast, honey baked ham, cheddar & gruyere cheese battered in egg, grilled, served w/ homemade jam:\nOf course I had to try the the amazing Monte Cristo sandwich as I am a fan of French sandwiches. It was beautifully plated with 4 thick triangle sandwiches, each one made up of 3 slices of battered bread. The middle slice in each sandwich makes the Monte Cristo. The plate was dusted with a little powdered sugar and accompanied with potatoes and fresh fruit. The sandwich was so fluffy and lightly crisped up on the outside. I actually thought it could have used more turkey, to balance out the carb to protein ratio, but I'm always in favor of more meat. After finishing that sandwich, I definitely felt like I had consumed enough carbs for the whole day. The jam helped me chew through all the bread, while also adding a sweet component.\n\n$11.95 Blueberry Pancakes:\nI'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but these are some very moist and fluffy pancakes. It was satisfying to cut into the fresh blueberries embedded in the pancakes.\n\n$4.95 Spicy Italian Sausage:\nThis sausage was halved and flattened out, almost looking like a sausage patty. Delicious.\n\nThe prices at Mama's are not bad compared to most brunch places with long waits. I'd still like to try the crab Benedict or pick up some freshly baked items from the Bake Shop. So perhaps one day I'll return for brunch in the afternoon, which is when I usually have my first meal on weekends.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-05-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the crab benedict, but I have to say that the real highlight of the meal was the blueberry pancakes which were seriously the best I've ever had! \n\n"], "author": "Elise K.", "review": "This place was amazing!!

It wasn't greasy by any means, but the bread was moist enough to appreciate the perfect amount of butter that got the sandwich to grill just right.

The jam was fruity and florescent, with a calmly sweet taste to it.  This dish was  my favorite.\n\nFresh Crab Sandwich Special\nThe crab was quite fresh to the taste and was seasoned so nicely.

So we'd try whatever we wanted on this one special visit.\n\nWe ordered (note photos are not mine):\n\n* French Toast Sampler - House Baked Bread made with Cranberries, Fresh Orange Juice and Walnuts battered in Egg Whites, Chocolate Cinnamon French Toast, and Banana Bread French Toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#qpaVLJLdxdVkhHrWoooTVA\n\n* Pan Dore - Slices of Sourdough Baguette with Saut\u00e9ed Apples in Lemon Butter Sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#v-qevWmOqGFBPzVaUXO2sA\n\n* Blueberry Pancakes - Blueberries inside the fluffy pancakes and out http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#hRjUmhJhxN4PaZDEg_jyxQ\n\n* Vegetarian Eggs Benedict - Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms, Avocado, Baby Spinach and Grilled Tomato http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#oo1oZHVRl93w_Mw-MyriRQ\n\n* Chocolate Crumb Cake - Warmed up and very sweet http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mamas-san-francisco?select=bMs0gU72ZjeB1CXDt2_YMg#vWOA05LUl46MXE91JchA5Q\n\n* Fresh Orange Juice - Super fresh and sweet\n\nIt was a carb fest of gut-busting proportions. We had plenty leftover. While the food was 5 star worthy, I have to dock a star for the wait. Unless you're into that, it makes me think about the former USSR and those poor bastards who had to wait in line for things, and thank G-d I usually don't have to. Phew.\n\nOur favorites were the Cranberry French Toast and Pan Dore (a unique dish), followed very closely by the Blueberry Pancakes. Their house-made jam was excellent as well. I wasn't crazy about the Eggs Benedict, but I liked the home fried potatoes that came with it.\n\nTo get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen. When we were there yesterday, the handle came off the faucet, so there was a definite plumbing issue to address. Be prepared for a wait and for cash only.\n\nI thought the food was really delicious and excellent, but I wouldn't travel a distance and wait in a huge line for it.

Did I mention that I arrived about 2:30p, just a half hour before closing, hoping to avoid the lunchtime crowds?  And I still had to wait an hour! \n\nThe omelette was good.  It was a vegetarian variety -- spinach, onions, egg whites, etc.  The breakfast potatoes were also pretty good.  I enjoyed the slices of homemade bread that they included on the plate.  But, was it better than Rick & Ann's in Berkeley, where I seldom have to wait more than 10 minutes?  Marginally, if at all.  (When Bette's Oceanview Diner does it right, its omelettes are better, though there is less variety).\n\nIt's a pleasant place, and on a nice sunny day, looking out over Washington Square is a delight.  But who wants to wait an hour for eggs?  The whole brunch thing is something that I simply don't get.  People flock to these tiny \"quaint\" places, wait in grostequely long lines for an interminable amount of time for eggs.\n\nIt's too bad.  My girlfriend loves brunch (her running favorite is Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley -- another place that has obscenely long waits; Mama's is worse).  I'd love to introduce her to Mama's to spice up our brunch rotation, but with food that more-or-less runs with the pack, why would I bother?  Why would anyone?\n\nGranted, as a vegetarian, there's a lot on the menu I wouldn't touch.  The person in front of my raved about their Monte Cristo; the person behind me was jonesin' for the Slim Joe Burger.  Perhaps with life-affirming options like those, I could be inspired to waste my life away for a meal at Mama's.  For vegetarians, however, it's the standard brunch alternatives (eggs, pancakes, french toast) or a handful (as in three) of additional vegetarian lunch options (quesadilla, sandwich, quiche).  I'm sure they are all reasonably satisfying, even if the options aren't as varied.\n\nIn a perfect world, I might venture out to try the French toast or the pancakes even though as someone who doesn't eat breakfast much I haven't eaten them in over twenty years.  But, alas, this world ain't perfect, and my time is too valuable to spend 90 minutes for a breakfast plate that at most I would acknowledge as good.\n\nI wish Mama well, but there are reasons why I moved out of the house long ago.\n\nPlease Note:  CASH ONLY.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-04-11"}, {"excerpts": ["lunch... \n\nslim joe burger\nmonte cristo\n\ntry them, love them, let them show you how food should be prepared."], "author": "Wayne L.", "review": "this place is one of my absolute favorite breakfast spots of all time... and in a way raised my level of expectation when going to any other breakfast spot.  i practically grew up eating at this place.\n\nthe ingredients are all fresh and the atmosphere is both cozy and friendly.  i always love to start with a freshly squeezed OJ, some fresh berries, possibly one of their fresh baked coffee cakes or something and maybe a slice of their home made kugelhof french toast.  since they have the best hollandaise sauce i have ever had, i usually go with their eggs benedict, which is very traditional, or their crab benedict.. or the one with spinach.  any of them are delicious.  the homefries are fresh and very tasty, they go great with the hollandaise sauce and a smidge of paprika.\n\nif you aren't in the mood for their benedicts, go for an omelet or some french toast/pancakes.  the berries are fresh if you go the french toast route, the kugelhof french toast it amazingly good and after all the years of eating french toast, this place has the best i have ever had.  (sorry chloe's, your croissant french toast is great, this kugelhof would be world renown if more people knew about it).  actually, maybe it is world renown, the line to get into this place is ridiculous, i have literally seen it go around the block.  as in it went down the street, you turn the corner and it went down the entirety of the next street.  needless to say, the weekend is not a great time to go, but if you see a short line, jump in and enjoy the best breakfast you will ever have.\n\nsince i haven't hit my 5001 world limit, i will go into how wonderful the omelets and ingredients taste.  since everything is absolutely fresh, there is no mistaking that all of their flavorful omelets are delicious.  from the washington square with fresh panchetta to their south of the border blackbean omelet.  \n\noh, and they have this thing called an apple pan dore, its french toast with sliced apples in some crazy sweet sauce.  try their bacon or italian sausage with this.  its divine.\n\nas you can tell, i get very excited when thinking about eating at this place, its mouth watering.\n\nlunch... \n\nslim joe burger\nmonte cristo\n\ntry them, love them, let them show you how food should be prepared.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-02-20"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend got the monte cristo and I ordered the slim joe burger.

The poached eggs from the eggs benedict were the most perfect poached eggs I've ever eaten in my life. THEY WERE PERFECTION ON A PLATE.\n\n2. The hollandaise sauce on these egg benedicts were soo good. You can tell right away it's not going to be too rich due the color of the sauce. If it's too yellow, it's too rich and overwhelming. But the light yellow hollandaise sauce was amazing and I finished all of it.\n\n3. I normally don't like french toast, but these were pretty good. Also, it was the most prettiest plate I have ever seen in my life. I MEAN LOOK AT THE COLORS OF THAT PLATE.\n\n4. MONTEEEEEEEEEE CRISTOOOOOOOOOO. need i say more? This isn't your average monte cristo. It's not oily at all. Its crispy on the outside and gooey and cheesy on the inside. And that raspberry jam it comes with oh my god. Remember this is an ALL DAY food item so you can order this for breakfast too! I wish I would have just ordered this as my main dish. Damn it was good. \n\n5.

We also had brunch drinks, which is pretty standard although they tried to be creative with it - white wine with lemonade (my friend didn't like it, but I thought it was decent). Our cashier gave us more french toast complimentary to welcome us to SF, since we both just relocated here. Friendly, but slow service. It was also a little frustrating how you have to stand in line to order, wait and then get seated and wait some more for your food to come out. And when you're waiting outside, you see several empty tables inside and it's like, why aren't they seating more people? They are creating a line on purpose. I hate that. Or maybe just slow and inefficient operation. Decent food, but not worth the hype.

I was excited thinking that we made it as we got to the door, and then my heart dropped when I saw the line INSIDE. WHHYYYYYYYYYYYY.

I need to remind myself that my stomach can't take in as much food as my eyes do... needless to say I was very full and couldn't finish the pancakes.

Alas, that did not work out for me since that piece of heaven was about $21.50, and I just couldn't justify spending that much on a benny, especially when they had about 10 other ones to choose from. I ended up getting the smoked salmon benny, which was AHmazing. The salmon was super rich but not heavy, and adding the avocado to it added just the right amount of that something that I was looking for. \n\nGot a carrot cake to-go for the bf since he was at home, and I knew he would probably want something from Mama's. The cake itself was pretty good, however, at times the texture was a bit off, but the taste was still there. The frosting, though, was absolutely creamy, dreamy, and delicious. I kinda cheated and whilst sharing with him turned into a frosting hog. It was so good that he called me out several times, whoops. :)\n\nTo top everything off I got a drink, mimosa to be exact, at brunch, of course. However, I noticed they had two kinds of mimosas, the regular OJ, and another one that I've never seen paired with champagne...grapefruit! Interesting! I had to get it! I asked them to put more champagne than grapefruit, and wow...hit the spot. I seriously loved my grapefruit mimosa. So refreshing. So delicious. So addictive. Trust me, get it.

I could hear from the conversations that most of the people in line were locals so I could only imagine what the line would be like on the weekends...(shudder.)\n\nSo after a 45 minute wait in the sunshine, my sister and I were finally called up to the coveted spot at the front doors to await the line to finally order food. Luckily, they post their specials on the window adjacent to said door and much like the ritual at the \"Soup Nazi's\", one should have their order ready and cash out. By the way, this place does NOT take credit cards in case you didn't notice but they will accept ATM debit cards with a slight fee. \n\nWe decided on the french toast sampler with fresh fruit and the Northern Italian with two cups of coffee. Mama's also serves fresh juices and mimosas with orange and grapefruit juice but I reserve alcohol for special occasions so I declined this time. The best part about standing in line forever is the line for the cash register. You're just a mere 6 inches from the actual kitchen and the scent of batter, fresh cake, muffins and sourdough tempt and lure you. Mmmm...I love breakfast.\n\nAfter ordering and paying (about $30) we were sat at a little 2 top table facing the kitchen and patiently waited for coffee. There's only about 2 servers for the entire dining room so I am forgiving about 4 minutes for a cup of coffee and I take it with a grain of salt. The food arrives hot and gorgeous promptly and it makes up for the almost now hour wait. \n\nThe french toast is made with cranberry-orange, banana, and cinnamon swirl loaf bread. All of this is topped off with strawberries, blueberries and half of a banana and lightly dusted off with powdered sugar. This entire concoction is sweet enough with just the sugar and fruit that you don't need the maple syrup taking up space on the plate. I honestly couldn't remember how my sister's omelette tasted but it must have been good considering how most of it was finished.\n\nA word of warning if you're coming to Mama's to have a nice meal and conversation with a friend: the tables are cramped and you will have no privacy. There is no such thing as \"can I have a window seat\" or \"could we have a booth.\" Nuh uh. Forget about it. I was within inches of the couples to my left and right and apparently, whatever I was saying offended them enough to stop them in mid-conversation.

Figured it was just the wrong day so we said we'd come back another day when it wasn't so busy.

The Californian Omelette was delicious and fresh - loved the potatoes that came with them.  And the Dungeness Crab Benedict was tasty too!

I would gladly walk back to San Francisco from Los Angeles and wait another 2.5 hours to eat at this place. Mama's set the bar for breakfast in my mind. Obviously they should be larger and opened longer, but that's part of the allure. I am a Chef and business major. I understand. Nonetheless, I can't wait to get back to Mama's.

Jeff loves eating so I thought this would be a good place for our final SF meal together.\n\nI knew to expect a long wait.  We arrived at 10:15 on a Friday morning and a long line had already started.  We arrive to the front door and end of ordering line about 45 minutes later.  Probably sat at like 10:55 and got our food around 11:15 or so.  So all in all waited an hour for food.\n\nI ordered the french toast with the apples and lemon sauce stuff.  There was an advertisement on the window for it winning an award so I thought it would be a good choice.  Jeff got a salmon scramble thingie.  We both got mimosas and coffee.  Jeff got toast with his meal so he got to try the olallieberry jam.  \n\nMy meal was ok.  It was french toast made with a bagutte cut long-ways.  The french toast was really eggy which I like.  It takes a bite out of the sweetness.  And this is just that--VERY sweet.  It has this lemony sauce in the place of syrup and sauteed apples on top of that.  It was just a little too sweet for me.  \n\nI ordered a chicken apple sausage on the side and it was amazing.  You could tell they cooked it in the same pan they cook the bacon and other fatty yummy stuff because it was pretty greasy.  Which was nice because it definitely gave me a nice break from the sweet french toast.\n\nI tried a bit of Jeff's scramble and it was pretty tasty.  Nothing spectacular but very good and had fresh salmon.  He also got a side of pancakes and they were probably the best thing either of us ordered.  Light, fluffy, perfect combination of salty and sweet.  Pretty much why I love breakfast in one wonderful bite.\n\nAlso, Mama's should be commended for the olallieberry jam.  Its soooo fantastic.  My mom took my sister and I and some of our childhood friends olallieberry picking every summer north of Half Moon Bay and it brought me back.

It's Mama's, that restaurant that always has a ridiculous line (even when it's freaking closed) and is on every to-eat list in San Fracisco.

Being the kind of person who actually doesn't mind lines all that much (you're probably with friends if it's a restaurant, right?), it becomes about the charm.  The food, the service, the smiles; oh, how Mama's lacks.\n\nFirst things first: the line.  Expect it to be apparently over an hour, especially if you don't feel like getting up early.

It looks like a freaking American flag, though there's nothign wrong with that if that was the intention, which I kind of doubt.  And considering the three types of toast are as different as flavor profiles can be, it's odd that three different fruits are dumped on the top of the all of them - acceptable for your mama while at home, but not a restaurant serving alledgedly the best French toast on this coast.  To boot, the toast wasn't all that great; I enjoyed the fruit more.\n\nNorthern Italian - Pancetta (Italian Cured Bacon) , Mushrooms, Fresh Basil, Tomatoes, and Garlic Jack Cheese $10.95: Considering everything, this actually wasn't that bad of an omelette, except that the bacon completely ruined the it.  The crispy crunch really doesn't help the consistency or give it an interesting texture, instead distracting you from the rest of the gooey soft goodness, making you think 'who the hell put that in here?'  It'd probably be a decent dish if they used something a bit softer, say, a more stereotypically Italian sausage?  You can evaluate for yourself what the bread and orange were like based on the picture (not great...), the potatoes were, well potatoes.  It's a good portioning for that - enough to make you happy but not enough to be the main course.\n\nSo, Mama's.

Oh my goodness. \nSuch a awesome place to spend my birthday brunch. Everyone was in such a great mood. It was just an overall pleasant way to start the morning. \n\n- I believe total line wait time was 1hour & 1/2. It was worth it though! So off the bat, two of my friends & I decided we were going to split the French toast platter. It came w 3 of their signature French toast. I really loved the cranberry orange one! Distinct orange flavors, dried cranberries in the batter.. Ah, perfection. \nI ordered for my main dish, a salmon benedict. I've never had one before, wasn't sure what Hollandaise sauce was.. Okayyyyyyyy, why haven't I tried this dish sooner!? It was deeeeelicious. Came w a good portion of potatoes. The entire plate was gone. \nMy group all equally enjoyed their food. \n\n- Quick mention: their screwdrivers are made w Soju! Funny story.. my friends told our waitress that they couldn't taste their liquor in their drinks. The people that I'm w are a liquor w a splash of orange juice type lolol.

Go to other brunch places to save you the wait!\n\nPros: \n- Good food (but not amazing)\n\nCons: \n- Long wait (at least an hour) since it's hyped and it's a small restaurant. You wait outside in the cold too\n- Very weak alcoholic drinks\n- Wrong prices on the menu\n\nWAIT - 45 minutes to get inside. Another 15 to get seated (for a party of 2. If you're a bigger party, wait for a little longer)\n\nFOOD - Ordered Monte Cristo since that's what Yelpers are raving about. From browsing through pictures on this site, it just looked like french toast and fried potatoes, but here's a pic of when I took a bite in it [http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dJ_ZTHjj6dZEKn_PVMd5AQ/l.jpg].  It's basically a french toast sandwich, with turkey, ham, and cheese in between. It is good I won't deny that. But for the wait we had, I expected more.  Bf wanted to get the eggs benedict, but we got so hungry from waiting in line that he got the omelette since it looked bigger. It was yummy but again, not impressed.\n\nDRINKS - After a long wait we wanted a drink. On the menu outside of the door, it said Mimosa for $7.95 and Screwdriver for $6.50. So we ordered the screwdriver and it came in a cute jam can. Now, I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but I tasted no alcohol and it was basically just orange juice! I told our waitress this and she said she can give me a mimosa instead, but that's not what I wanted. I just wanted to drink a bit of something since the wait was so long! Tryna scam me for a more expensive drink? But when we got the bill, we got charged $7 each for our screwdrivers. I told her it was $6.50 on the menu but she said \"No all our alcoholic drinks are $7.\" Uhhh.. well then you should charge me what's written on the menu!\n\nOVERALL - Expectations for this place were not met, so I'm not coming back. I'd recommend going to Lime in the Castro for brunch instead!

I don't think I've ever waited for Mama's breakfast this long before, but regardless of our 2 hour wait, it was all worth it in the end. \n\nI have tried the Dungeness Crab and Spinach Benedict - probably the best crab benedict I have ever had. Smoked Salmon Benedict - the smoked salmon is so delicious. French Toast Sampler - I would say my favorite of the three options is the banana walnut french toast. The Washington Square M'Omlette - savory and delicious. All of the breakfast options are served with a side of house potatoes and house jam. Honestly everything I've tried on the menu is cooked and crafted to perfection. But overall I think the dish that really wins my heart is the Dungeness Crab and Spinach Benedict. \n\nThey also have a nice selection of breakfast drinks - soju screwdrivers, bellini's, mimosas, and bloody marys.\n\nI don't understand how Mama's does it, they have the ability to make food so delicious that people are willing to wait 2 hours just to have a taste of the food!

They also have Bloody Marys and screwdrivers haha. \n\nEverything on the menu looked so good and I was debating for 15 minutes before I knew what I wanted. The way we ordered was like a cafeteria. We had to line up to place our order with the cashier and then we get seated. I ordered the Swedish Cinnamon French toast with a side of fresh fruits since they looked so good when I was standing in line. My friend ordered their infamous Benedict. Omg I should have ordered the Benedict with spinach and mushroom. Damn that thing looked sooooo good my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The French toast tasted really good with the berries and syrup. I'm glad the waitress told me about the jam that was on the table. I was wondering what it was and she told me it was lolly berry jam. I'm not even sure if it was lolly berry but that's what it sounded like to me. It was so good with the french toast.\n\nI'M COMING BACK! I'M COMING BACK!
