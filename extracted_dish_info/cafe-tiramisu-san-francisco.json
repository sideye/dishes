Risotto is perfect texture and the scallops are just lightly cooked, very tender.\nMonterey Calamari stuffed with crab and served on Italian garlic toast - Not as good as the risotto, but an ok dish. Nothing special here.\n\nEntree:\nI had the Black pepper crusted ahi tuna over a spicy shrimp risotto. A vast improvement over the dish I remember having two and a half years ago (slab of grilled salmon or something. It stands out because I remember it being very tender... almost as tender as the scottish salmon that Aqua used to serve). The tuna was only slightly seared and for the most part rare, just as I like it, but the highlight of the dish is the risotto. The texture of the rice and shrimp is perfect. Not really the spicy shrimp as described though.\n\nMy friend got the short ribs, which was an absolutely monstrous plate. It would be a good entree if you are starving. Didn't ask him how it tasted as I was too focused on my dish.\n\nDessert:\nMy friend's Profiteroles looked amazing, but I had the warm chocolate cake. It came with a hazelnut \"soup\" and a scoop of chocolate ice cream. The dish is pretty sweet for my tastes, but not too sugary. I did like dipping the chocolate cake into the chocolate hazelnut soup. It reminded me of dunking oreo cookies into chocolate milk for that soggy texture.\n\nService - Standard. If you've eaten in Belden Alley before, you know what to expect.\n\n-1 star for not being able to seat us outside and putting us all alone in the overflow dungeon downstairs. I had a reservation too! The air was stuffy and smelled of detergent. Regardless, the food was good.\n\nTotal cost - $210\n- 5 people, no wine, 2 diet cokes, 3 coffees.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-08-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Seared Ahi Tuna with Risotto", ": i give this one a 4/5 rating.

I must be getting old.\n\nAnyway, this was a picture perfect night.  Why??  Well, it might have to do with my childhood of being around a bunch of people during the holidays and being outside in inclement weather.  This night, we were with our kids, one of my kid's friends and our two friends from Oregon.  We were going to just stay home and have homemade spaghetti sauce and some garlic bread - I am sure glad we decided to come into the city!!!\n\nWe parked at Union Square garage, went by Macy's and saw the kitties and pups, saw the tree in the square and then went to Chinatown for some bargain xmas shopping - my kids idea.  All the while, the rain was coming down in buckets.  After a few stops in Chinatown, we decided to get a snack, but, decided otherwise since everyone wanted more than a bite.  I remembered Cafe Tiramisu from another celebration, so, off we went from Chinatown.\n\nThe place is located in Belden alley, which in my mind, is a perfect little getaway.  The scene couldn't have been more perfect.... walking down Bush street, jumping over huge puddles, me yelling out to the crowd through the rain buckets \"take a left, it's down that alley.  The bright neon sign above the door showed us the way to our perfect destination.\n\nEvery dish that was ordered was consumed in record time, not because we were overly ravenous, rather, because with each bite you wanted more!!\n\nI had the Caesar and the short ribs.  The Caesar was good, nothing extraordinary.  The short rib didn't look like much, just a long piece of meat on a bed of horseradish mashed potatoes with a red/brown sauce.  But the taste.....it was veryyyyy good, succulent meat - didn't even need to chew it, it was that tender.  The sauce was also perfect.  I also had a Manhattan and a glass of Cab - both accompanied my meal perfectly.\n\nWe all ordered dessert, because, well.... our other choice was to leave and go into a major downpour.  So, we stayed, had cappuccinos and some sweets.  The profiteroles were amazing, the tiramisu was off the charts, I had the sugar and cinnamon coated doughnuts filled with italian custard.   OH  MY EFFIN GOD - THESE WERE AMAZING!!!  Maybe one of the top 5 desserts I ever had - that good.\n\nWe were the last in the restaurant, the manager gave us some comp'd lemoncello's. We got to talking to him and the next thing you know, it's 10:15!!!  (we got there at 7:30!!!).  So we bid Tiramisu a fond farewell and went out into the night.\n\nBut.... our night wasn't done yet!!!  We walked over to the B of A building (in light rain) to see that tree - it is much nicer than the Union Square tree, imo.  After a photo shoot around the tree, I came up with the idea to walk down to the Hyatt Regency to see their Christmas display.  It was nice, it was warm, it was dry.  After a few trips up and down the elevators (and finding the on/off switch for the lobby xmas tree on the 14th floor and messing with that, hehe) we settled into the Hyatt bar for a drink.\n\nAll in all, just a perfect evening with wonderful companions on a picture-perfect night (for me).  This night, not only thanks to Tiramisu, will go down in the annals as one of my fav holiday season visits to the city.  It was just that good.  Sometimes a perfect storm can be quite positive, and in this case, truer words could not be uttered. \n\nYa feel me??", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-12-03"}, {"excerpts": ["The first time I had Beef Short Ribs and the cheese platter and the second time Veal Scalapini....

Why!!!!!\nI know KQED has a lot of foodies, and it's quality t.v. so while in the City I was dying to try this place.  We were greeted by the hostess, the owner was as my bf. said \"kind of an ass', didn't get the friendly vibe like on the show.  We were sat at the very back, people have said \" They felt as if they were transported to Italy!\" Yea it smelled like the Venice canals.  I get it, its an old building but the smell was off putting and gets worse when you go down stairs to use the bathroom or being punished and actually have to sit at the tables down there...  The owner took our order, didn't go over any specials maybe there weren't any?  The menu wasn't that exciting, I wanted to try the homemade pasta and at the recommendation of the owner I ordered the Paperadelle with meat sauce and the bf had Veal Scallopine.  Truthfully nothing sounded all that great.  I ordered a deeelish Prosecco, the waiter brought out with bread, never caught his name.  The bread is made in house, again nothing exciting rolls that should have been served warm I thought and the dipping oil people raved about on this site was forgettable.   I ate a lot of bread since I knew the entree was gonna tank, it did... My dish was paperdalle noodles that were super thin, maybe that's how they are in Italy but I like my pasta with a bit of substance.  The sauce was kinda tasteless except for an overbearing wine taste.  Meeehhh on my food. The bf loooovvveeed his Veal Scaloppine, I don't eat veal but I tried the Parmesan Risotto and again I have had better.  So I thought I will try the Tiramisu, terrible.  Again made in house but over espresso-ed and the bitter chocolate powder was just that a bitter addition, the dish wasn't overly sweet that the powder needed to be added.  It was super crowded, why who knows.  I'm no food expert but this experience for me was bad.  And to offend all the foodies out there, Maggianos which is a chain has better food and the atmosphere doesn't need to transport me anywhere except to sheer ecstasy.  Their Tiramisu is wonderful, and you get as much as you want!  Some Yelper posted on her review that an appetizer, 6 beers and 3 or 4 entrees was $ 150.00, for 1 salad 2 entrees 1 prosecco and a coke was close to $ 80.00 and for a 20% tip we left $ 100.00 lighter.  It's kinda upscale, maybe since I was wearing a Giants ball cap nice yoga outfit and tennis shoes and the b.f. the same we looked like we didn't belong there?

We had a wonderful waiter who was on top of everything!\n\nI was only eating small plates because of the hour.

The scallops were good however my expectations were that the sauce would have a sweeter taste with the butternut squash sauce but I really could not taste the squash at all.  They were still delicious!\n\nMy son who is so picky at 13 could not find anything that he wanted to eat, but my hubby and the waiter were able to create a spaghetti and veal meatball dish, that he loved!\n\nHubby had the short rib ravioli, he liked it but said he would not order it again, just something about the taste.\n\nIt is located in the financial district in this cool alley with other restaurants.  They featured outside seating but we chose to eat inside.  The place has a great authentic Italian feel, and I cannot say enough about our waiter and his service.\n\nThe only thing minor thing I would add is the menu was kind of limited in choices.  I definitely would go back to try some other dishes.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-11-17"}], "roasted brussels sprouts": []}
