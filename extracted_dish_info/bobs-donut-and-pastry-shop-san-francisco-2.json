Our family continues this tradition to this day, dedicated to preserving the art of making handmade donuts. We are proud to be one of the last independent donut shops that still make our donuts and pastries from scratch. Our donuts have a classic taste...\"\n\nNow don't expect fancy here. Expect something from Hill Valley from Back to The Future, sans the root beer float and Chip. You can expect counter stools and small rickety cafe tables. Stacks of pink to-go donut boxes clutter half the counter top and a crew somewhat as dated as the stools. On my latest visits a couple of younger employees liven the place up. One kid blasts gangsta rap behind the counter! No longer is it only Bob and grumpy beehives working. I'm not sure if the latest hires are to entice the young hipster drunks, but it seems to work with the myriad of customers I saw - coming and going. Old and young, all wanting donuts! I've had the maple bar, old fashion plain, chocolate donut, cake donut, glazed donut, etc. I have yet to try the legendary apple fritter or the gigantic donut! \n\nBob's Donuts (did the hipsters add \"pastry\" to it?) is one old school donut shop! The coffee is average at best, but damn it works at 2am. The donuts on the other hand, are exceptional and always freshly made. Fluffy AF! And yes, Bob has a loyal following not only with the drunks, but those that know the warm fluffy donuts freshly pop out before 5am. \n\nAll in all, I recommend trying Bob's at any hours at least once, but if you want the full effect come after midnight and before the sunrises. That's all part of the Bob's Donut urban 'lore. Try the donut eating contest Bob has going too - that might be fun (or annoying) with a group of sniffling hipsters, but I'd refrain from the contest showdown with the pimp vs. John. Yet, today Bob's Donut is no longer just for the drunks and hood rats... it's for all to enjoy! \n\nAnd \"she ain't nothing more than a pit-bull with lipstick!\" I think I heard Bob say that once... well it was Twilight time!

Bob's enlightened me to a new world of possibilities where a donut can actually taste amazing.\n\nIf you come on a Saturday night, prepare to wait in line.

Bob's is hands down the best I have ever had. The dough is so delicately fluffy and mild. The jelly just oozes out in perfection.

Who would be crazy enough to buy one? Apparently we were, to the point where we ended up getting two. The dough is cloud-like, gently melting in your mouth. The hype of M&Ms or 50 Cent melting in your mouth doesn't even come close (no homo). The flavor is all in the topping, which blends wonderfully with the rest of the donut. \n\nMy friend who initiated the excursion here ended up leaving the 2nd donut at our afterparty spot.

I think the donuts would have tasted better when fresh, or at least slightly heated up. We decided to heat it up using the microwave provided by the front of the shop. But I soon realized that after heating it up my croissant got flat instead of the crispy and flaky I wanted (my fault).\n\nDespite the change in texture of my croissant, I was able to finish it and still thinks it tasted pretty good. But it's nothing to write home to mother about. My friend, on the other hand, was not able to finish her buttermilk donut (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES donuts). The cake crumble that we got to-go was also not that great and also went un-finished. My friend thinks its because it lost a certain air of freshness to it.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by this place, especially because there are so many good reviews and people talking about this place.

What better place to start than with one of my all time favorite late night spots right? This one's for you Bob's!\n\n First of all, there are two important elements to what makes this place stand out:\n1) You can get a donut here 24 hours a day. \n2) They continue to make fresh donuts late at night.\n\n A traditional donut shop generally makes most of their donuts early in the morning. This means that the later you get there, the older the donuts taste. Because they are continually making donuts, just ask the staff for one from the freshest batch and you will always enjoy that fresh donut taste. And there are only a few things as magical as the melt-in-your-mouth, fresh-from-the-fryer donut taste. Just ask any cop, lol. No seriously, ask them. That being said, most of the donuts I've tried are definitely above average in texture and flavor but at the same time not really anything extraordinary. To me, the fresh donuts are really the major appeal here.\n\n The other thing that sets them apart is their GIANT DONUT. You really haven't had the full Bob's experience until you've had their big donut. Yum! As far as I've seen when I go, they have at least three flavors. Glazed, chocolate, and crumb. I've gotten the big donut a few times now and I'm leaning toward the glazed as my personal favorite.\n I'd rather not ask how many calories is in one of these things but let me just say that I definitely recommend bringing a few friends along to help finish it off. And an equally GIANT glass of milk!\n Unfortunately, these are not as plentiful as the rest of their stock so they don't always have them ready but that's the unpredictability of supply and demand yeah? Also, on one particular occasion I brought home a big donut home and discovered it was not cooked all the way through. Many sad faces were earned that day =(, but that's the only time I've been disappointed it the few years I've been going. However, I still feel they deliver an above average product quite reliably and will make it a high priority destination next time I return to the mainland. \n\nThanks Bob's, and may you continue to please donut lovers for years to come!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-02-27"}, {"excerpts": ["I'm not even a big donut person..", "and I've taken others to bobs who claim the same..

But twice I came here with my boyfriend in a sudden urge for a donut to find the shop closed and dark, teasing us with its neon-lit open sign.  Even calling the phone number got no answer (obviously).  I asked the lady at the counter about their hours when I came back on a weekday.  \"24 hours!\" she said.  Then I asked, \"Even Sundays?\"  \"Oh we're closed 6-10.\"  Ahem.  That's minus one star for not posting their hours.  Sorry, I become unhappy without a sugar fix.\n\nRegardless, the pastries and donuts here are amazing.  I remember sitting at the mini tables on a \"bad date\" (not the current bf, mind you).  They are nice for an intimate post-dinner footsie, but obviously not for me.  I wished they were larger so I could get a good sugar fix without the bad date in my face.\n\nGet the donuts and pastries when they're fresh from the oven.  I came here on a Saturday night around 10 pm and had a fabulous freshly baked glazed donut.  The other times I have come, I had the apple fritter, a cheese pastry and an apple turnover.  Amazing, but would be better if warm.  I often take the pastry/donut with me back on the 49 to the mission.  Convenient location too, a block from Van Ness!\n\nI find it rather difficult to know what to get since the goods don't have labels.  It's all about pointing-- \"the thing with nuts...no no, that one to the left, no a little farther...\"  I often have to go outside to look through the window and decide what to want.  Was that an intentional design decision (give people fresh air? let pedestrians experience the goods?)  or just simply bad layout?\n\nThe ladies at the counter are unpretentious.  They happily accommodate both the rowdy club-goers and those coming for a quick sugar fix.  The walls are filled with glowing reviews of the place, but still they carry a community feeling.  \"Friends are welcome here.\"\n\nWhen I first came here, I went to Bob's diner on the corner.

My friend and I came on a Tuesday around 3 pm, and there was no line and maybe one other person at their sit-down tables. We came after hearing so many people talk about \"the challenge,\" which is basically eating a large donut (worth $12) in 3 minutes or less. But after arriving at the shop, we decided to just get the regular donuts because we had just finished having lunch and didn't have much space left in our stomachs.\n\nI liked how they had a variety of options besides just donuts. When we went they had cinnamon buns and chocolate croissants! Chocolate croissants?! Yup. I've been on the look out for the best chocolate croissants in the NorCal area, and was pretty excited to try it out. My friend on the other hand got a buttermilk donut. We also got a cake crumble to-go for another friend. \n\nI think part of my disappointment with this place was when we were paying for our donuts and we asked the owner to see how big the big donut was (out of curiosity and to gage how much space we need in our stomachs for next time). She turned around to show it to us, and then proceeded to tell us that she didn't think we could do it because she hadn't seen any girl finish \"the big donut\" before. Yikes! I just looked on their website and see girl names, so I don't really know what she was talking about. \n\nMy chocolate croissant was very mediocre. The only good thing about it was it had chocolate filling throughout the croissant, unlike many others that just have some parts filled. I tried a bit of my friend's buttermilk donut and thought it tasted okay. It definitely had a distinct taste because of the buttermilk. I think the donuts would have tasted better when fresh, or at least slightly heated up. We decided to heat it up using the microwave provided by the front of the shop. But I soon realized that after heating it up my croissant got flat instead of the crispy and flaky I wanted (my fault).\n\nDespite the change in texture of my croissant, I was able to finish it and still thinks it tasted pretty good. But it's nothing to write home to mother about. My friend, on the other hand, was not able to finish her buttermilk donut (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES donuts). The cake crumble that we got to-go was also not that great and also went un-finished. My friend thinks its because it lost a certain air of freshness to it.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by this place, especially because there are so many good reviews and people talking about this place. To top it all off, I was very turned off by the half-gallon of half-&-half milk for the coffee just sitting out on the counter for who knows how long. Probably won't be coming back any time soon, but I really do want to give this place another shot (perhaps sometime in the far future).", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-12-20"}, {"excerpts": ["People want that sweet fried pastry all glazed up or filled.

Bob's enlightened me to a new world of possibilities where a donut can actually taste amazing.\n\nIf you come on a Saturday night, prepare to wait in line. Along with burritos, donuts are some of the most sought after drunchies. If Bob's opens a location in the Mission, that combination is very well possible. \n\n- Raspberry Jelly Filled Donut: I grew up eating sufganiyot, the Jewish version of a jelly donut. Bob's is hands down the best I have ever had. The dough is so delicately fluffy and mild. The jelly just oozes out in perfection. It's not too sweet and is the ultimate combination of rich raspberry flavor and blissfully fried dough.\n\n- LARGE DONUT: To this day, I still can't fathom how they pull off making these. Who would be crazy enough to buy one? Apparently we were, to the point where we ended up getting two. The dough is cloud-like, gently melting in your mouth. The hype of M&Ms or 50 Cent melting in your mouth doesn't even come close (no homo). The flavor is all in the topping, which blends wonderfully with the rest of the donut. \n\nMy friend who initiated the excursion here ended up leaving the 2nd donut at our afterparty spot. The next morning, her first text wasn't \"Hey are you hungover?\" or \"Hope you got home safe.\" It was \"Where is my donut? -___-\" That just proves what kind of addiction Bob's can trigger. \n\nThe comparison to your average Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme is simply heaven and Earth.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-10-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The raspberry filled donut tasted like a cross between a donut & an extremely light cake-- too good.

We thought Bob's would hit the spot: delicious and cheap donuts, how can you go wrong? Bob's highly exceeded our expectations -- we tried 5 different of their donuts and \"wow\" is all I have to say. Between the 5 of us, we got the following flavors: apple fritter, chocolate custard, caramel, original glazed, and a regular chocolate one. All of the are warm, fluffy, filled with probably 1000 calories each, and so delicious you won't know what to do with yourself. \n\nIt all comes down to personal preference when deciding which one is your favorite. I'm a big chocolate person, and I think overall, my favorite one was the chocolate donut (chocolate frosting on top), with custard stuffed inside of it. It was sooo chewy and creamy and had the *perfect* balance of everything in it. Not too much chocolate or custard. One of my friends loved the caramel one (this was probably my 2nd favorite) because it was simple and just hit the spot. The other three loved the apple fritter one the most, the donut that Bob's is famous for. It's super delicious and if you see them making it, you'll see them pour a tonnnn of milk over the donuts which probably infuses tons more calories but lots more goodness. The apple fritter one is super different and unique and unlike other donuts I've had, but I'm just a chocolate sucker at the end of the day.\n\nYou should totally come here after a meal or in the morning - or just whenever they're making fresh batches of them.

Sorry, I become unhappy without a sugar fix.\n\nRegardless, the pastries and donuts here are amazing.  I remember sitting at the mini tables on a \"bad date\" (not the current bf, mind you).  They are nice for an intimate post-dinner footsie, but obviously not for me.  I wished they were larger so I could get a good sugar fix without the bad date in my face.\n\nGet the donuts and pastries when they're fresh from the oven.  I came here on a Saturday night around 10 pm and had a fabulous freshly baked glazed donut.  The other times I have come, I had the apple fritter, a cheese pastry and an apple turnover.  Amazing, but would be better if warm.  I often take the pastry/donut with me back on the 49 to the mission.  Convenient location too, a block from Van Ness!\n\nI find it rather difficult to know what to get since the goods don't have labels.  It's all about pointing-- \"the thing with nuts...no no, that one to the left, no a little farther...\"  I often have to go outside to look through the window and decide what to want.  Was that an intentional design decision (give people fresh air? let pedestrians experience the goods?)  or just simply bad layout?\n\nThe ladies at the counter are unpretentious.  They happily accommodate both the rowdy club-goers and those coming for a quick sugar fix.  The walls are filled with glowing reviews of the place, but still they carry a community feeling.  \"Friends are welcome here.\"\n\nWhen I first came here, I went to Bob's diner on the corner.  Confused as to why I didn't see any donuts, I immediately saw some glazed eye people outside and followed them.  And so begins my love of Bob's donuts.

Yes sir, that's the stuff I'm talkin bout. \n\nThe apple fritters are a friend's favorite. They are HUGE. The biggest I've seen yet. Enough to last a couple days, if you have the will. \n\nMy favorite are the cake donuts. Crumb to be exact. Delicious and not greasy. A close second is the maple bar, my childhood favorite. \n\nFun fact: They make 6 donuts (one of each flavor - glaze, choc., etc.)  the size of a pink cake box on Friday and Saturday nights.

This same nice lady behind the counter says I just bought the last three.  She turns to me as I was leaving and offers to double my money.  I politely said no thanks, and she offers to triple my money.  Now I KNOW these must have been good since she offered $15 for just three of them, and not ever having them before, I had to get out of there FAST to get them in the car, and speed away before she could make me an offer I could not refuse.  I later found out that these are THAT GOOD.\n\nI also got some donuts as big as a frisbee.  The nice lady behind the counter says these go really quickly, as people order them for parties.
