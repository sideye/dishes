You have two corn tortillas with meat, topped with cilantro and onion; lime and salsa on the side from the salsa bar. \n\nSo naturally when I was asked to customize my tacos I was shaking my head in worry. I asked for the beans on the side and refused to put any cheese. C'mon, beans and cheese are for burritos, not tacos. I ordered one shrimp taco and one al pastor taco. The shrimp was amazing! Plump and juicy, the shrimp was cooked to perfection. I did not care for the al pastor. It was too sweet and made my taco soggy. \n\nOn my previous trips I've had the salmon salad and the beef taco.

The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that when phoning in an order to-go, at times, it can take just as long to wait in line.  Can't blame them though since La Corneta is always jam packed and the line always wraps around.  It is definitely worth the wait!\n\nHere is my usual order:\n- super steak and prawn burrito on spinach tortilla\n- tostadas de ceviche\n- strawberry fresca", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-09-15"}], "fish tostada": [{"excerpts": ["Even better is the fish tostada! \n\n"], "author": "Wendy G.", "review": "First time I drove by this place, there was a line out the door and down the block and I thought , \"Hey, they must be giving away burritos!\". Unfortunately, no free burritos--La Corneta is just that good that the place gets packed. Burritos, tacos, quesadillas are all huge and well-priced. The \"baby\" burritos are the best deal--and there's nothing \"baby\" about 'em. The fish burritos here feature salmon and are wonderful. Even better is the fish tostada! \n\nAnd don't wait in line--call ahead, order your Super Baby Fish Burrito and skip right up front to the register.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-02-21"}], "prawn tostada": [{"excerpts": ["I ordered the super prawn tostada for take out.
