I love a nice smokey flavor in my meat, but most of these were more stewed, so a little mushy. Even the al pastor which was kind of weird. It did have a nice chew though. The taco tortillas were different. Not corn or flour, but more like masa. I didn't really eat the tortillas so I can't advise on the difference, but it did get soggy in transit and wouldn't stay together to eat as a taco.\n\n*Breakfast Burrito: eggs, beans, rice, potato ($8), add Al Pastor (+$2.50)\n*Elote Loco: street corn with mayo, cheese, chile ($4)\n*Churros ($4.50)\n*Chips (1st order free with purchase, additional order $2 each)\n\nThe roomie got the burrito, I got the elote, and we shared the churros. I adored the elote. The corn was cooked nicely. The kernels were plump and juicy. The mayo, cheese, chile, and lime added a nice contrast in flavor though I wish the mixture was thicker so it would stick to the corn more. The churros were amazing. Fresh out of the fryer, so a nice crispy exterior. The whipped cream did dissipate in transit, so there really wasn't any when we got home.\n\nSalsas\n*Salsa de Mango: mango, pineapple, orange juice, garlic, chipotle, salt & pepper\n*Salsa Verde: tomatillo, jalapeno, garlic, cilantro, salt & pepper\n*Salsa Ranchera: tomato, tomatillo, garlic and olive oil\n*Salsa Habanero: fiery smoked habanero, garlic, onion and touch of tomato\n\nThey have a great salsa bar of the variety listed above along with Pickled jalapenos and carrots, Cilantro, Onions, Limes, and Radishes. I love salsa, so I got a 2-3 containers of each. My favs were the ranchera and habanero. The habanero had a nice kick. For some reason, I adore mango habanero, so mixing the two salsas provided that spicy sweet kick that enjoyed with the free chips.\n\nThe tacos weren't really my thing.
