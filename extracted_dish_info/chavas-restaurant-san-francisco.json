For those who don't know, pozole is a chile-based soup with pork and hominy.  Add tons of chopped onions, cilantro and lime to enhance the hearty soup.  Typically, pig's feet are also used in pozole, which can deter some people from eating it, but growing up in a very Chinese household, pig's feet are no foreign object to me.\n\nChava's $8.25 bowl of pozole is gigantic and can leave your bladder on the verge of bursting.  It's chock full of meat, pig's feet, and hominy.  Every spoonful is loaded with goodies.  Although the soup is a bright hue of red, it's not too spicy either.\n\nWe also tried their carnitas platter, which didn't do it for us.  The meat was bland and not crispy, the way carnitas should be.
