We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs ( the highlight of the meal) and the Orecchiette.

Their menu is pretty crazy, and the atmosphere is kind of divey, but has quality service and food. I came here with my coworkers, and we ordered a whole unofficial tasting menu. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Mozzarella balls: absolutely delicious. I don't normally like mozzarella, but these were perfection, fried with the texture of a tater tot and savory. \n- shrimp ceviche: kind of out of place, and the shrimp was cooked, but it was top notch! Really refreshing and punchy with flavor. Even the from a guy who makes his own ceviche loved it. \n- garlic bread: this was alright. It was slices of toast, with pretty raw minced garlic and cilantro all over it. WARNING: this will give you garlic breath for a couple days at least. No exaggeration. \n\nMain dishes:\n- Bucatini with mushroom and leek: this was one of my favorites. The bucatini is like a short spaghetti straw (it literally has a tunnel/hole through it!). It was really creamy, and the mushroom and leek offered it awesome mix of texture and subtle flavors.\n- Fall pappardelle: this one was just okay. By the time I got to this dish, the pasta was cooled and stuck together in an unappetizing mass, and I remembered it tasting slightly bitter \n- Zoodles: SO GOOD. I am a converted zoodle fanatic now. Everything about this dish was just perfect: the texture of the zoodles themselves (slightly crunchy), the fat juicy shrimp, and whatever sauce/seasoning they had complemented everything super well. \n- spaghetti with meatballs: I know they're famous for this dish, but I think my expectations were much higher.

So, I came here with said friend on a Sunday night. When we got there, we were told that there is a 15 minute wait and we were fine with that and the hostess told us that we could sit at the counter and order drinks while we waited. We waited for a bit, probably about 10 minutes and we were told that our table was ready. We got seated in a booth and given our menus.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, I settled on the spaghetti with meatballs since my friend was raving about them. He, himself, got the orecchiette with pancetta and got garlic bread for starters.\n\nThe garlic bread left a lot to be desired, it had some garlic spread but not nearly enough and was hardly salted at all. My friend got his orecchiette before I got my spaghetti (i.e. they didn't come at the same time) and I don't really find that to be a big deal but I know it's bad serving etiquette.\n\nMy spaghetti and meatballs were okay for a little bit but the more I ate it, the more I disliked it. I think the problem came from the fact that it was fresh tomato sauce and so it was VERY acidic with each bite. I ended up having to resort to eating a remaining slice of garlic bread to cut some of the acid. The meatballs themselves were okay, it felt like they used too much filler and so it didn't taste as meaty as I imagined it should have been. Quite honestly, I struggled to finish the plate and I ended up having to get help from my friend.\n\nMy friend complained about how salty his orecchiette was but I didn't try it so I can't say from personal experience but I trust his judgement. During our entire meal, we didn't get checked in on once. It wasn't like the place was super busy and it wasn't that we needed anything in particular, but it's one of those things that we felt like that we weren't welcomed; it's a bit difficult to describe that feeling because it's not like they did anything in particular (really a more lack thereof) to make us feel that way.\n\nOver all, I can't say I look forward to coming back. It's one of those places that I feel like that I would come back if someone wanted to come but it would not be a place I would suggest going to. The food wasn't pleasing, the service was pretty non-existent and kids were running around like they owned the place (I know, it's not the place's fault but it's not Chuck-E-Cheese either).
