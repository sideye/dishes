Granted, my living here has never once tempted me indoors (I usually stick to Chinese on Clement or just simple dim sum I pick during window shopping excursions for cheesy stocking stuffers in Chinatown) but tonight was different.

It's not your typical Chinese place, kind of upscale, so a $6 lunch seemed like a great deal.\n\nEverything started fine. We sat down and were given soup and hot tea. One of my friends asked for hot oil, they don't have the condiments on the tables. The soup was a very bland egg drop type thing with lots of tofu and carrots; I didn't like it. After about ten minutes, that is hours in soup time, my friend had to ask for the hot oil again. I tried a bit of oil in the soup but it really didn't improve it much. I tried to eat around the tofu as best I could but left most of it in the bowl.\n\nWhen they took our order I asked what the waiter recommended and he suggested the Hunan fish.

We called the waiter over and tried to explain but he didn't understand so the owner came over and I believe he thought we were complaining that there was too much sauce. We decided to switch to pot stickers instead. Still no Hunan fish!\n\nFinally about 20 minutes after the first dish came out I got my lunch. It was very good but I thought a little soy sauce might make it even better so had to ask for it, they don't have the condiments on the tables.\n\nFinally the pot stickers came out and they were the best I've ever had. We wanted to put vinegar on them so we had to ask for it because they don't have the condiments on the tables!\n\nThe food was good but the service was a catastrophe. My friends that go there a lot say it isn't usually like that so I'll give them another try and they could very well get another star out of me. \n\nOne bit of advice though; ask for all of the condiments as soon as you sit down so you don't have to wait for them later.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-08-17"}, {"excerpts": ["By far the groups favorites were the sesame beef, spicy eggplant and the walnut prawns.

Go figure. My favorite chinese restaurant is called ERICS! lol.  \n\nErics is a little place tucked away on beautiful Church Street in Noe Valley. I like it because its unassuming but nice enough to have small group parties and impromptu lunches (It's like shopping at a little neighborhood boutique rather than a department store)\n\nhttp://erics.ypguides.net/\n\nA mixture of Hunan and Mandarin Chinese Cuisine, the food here is \"clean\"-- never overly cooked, never overly sauced, never greasy. I love eating chinese food where I'm not OVERWHELMED and ASSAULTED by the sauces, spices or oils. At Eric's I'm pleasantly surprised by the taste of the meats, or the vegetables, \"accented\" by the spices and sauces. That's how cooking should be!\n\nI'm always suspicious of places that overly sauce. What are they hiding? And why can't I taste anything else BUT the sauce? YIKES!\n\nMy favorite dishes at Eric's is the Sesame Chicken, the Walnut Prawns, the Garlic Eggplant, the Hunan Fish and House Fried Rice. Each are presented tastefully on white plates. And if your vegetarian, do not dismay, they have alot of dishes for you as well.\n\nI can't find anything wrong with this place, and wished more places EDITED when cooking. It's not a fancy place, although you'll find people dressed business casual, to just casual. But it's also not a dive. Tables are draped in white cloth with votive candles, for that bistro feel... The large picturesque windows give you a view of one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco. And if you've ever entered this place from a wintery rainy evening; it sets a beautiful mood as your enjoying your hot & sour soup, while looking out at the wet and rainy streets.\n\nEric's is just a great place to have a nice \"fresh and clean\" tasting meal. I'd recommend Erics' to everyone. Because there aren't many tables, you won't be at a loss for table service either. \n\nBut seriously come here for the food. I love it! (If their tables are full and there's a wait.. walk on over to Alice's (Sanchez Street) just around the corner, and at the tail end of Valley Street behind the Church...

They had several interesting choices on the lunch side so I decided to stick with that. It's not your typical Chinese place, kind of upscale, so a $6 lunch seemed like a great deal.\n\nEverything started fine. We sat down and were given soup and hot tea. One of my friends asked for hot oil, they don't have the condiments on the tables. The soup was a very bland egg drop type thing with lots of tofu and carrots; I didn't like it. After about ten minutes, that is hours in soup time, my friend had to ask for the hot oil again. I tried a bit of oil in the soup but it really didn't improve it much. I tried to eat around the tofu as best I could but left most of it in the bowl.\n\nWhen they took our order I asked what the waiter recommended and he suggested the Hunan fish. One of my friends ordered a chicken broccoli and cashew dish and the other ordered an eggplant and shrimp thing that wasn't on the lunch menu.\n\nFirst they brought out the eggplant dish and then the chicken lunch. My friends were sharing so one took some rice off of the plate and the other one started to eat the chicken when the waiter came and took the plate away. He came back with a brand new one and put it down in front of my friend with the only explanation being \"you order spicy\". I was left sitting there with no food and no plate to put any of the already served food on. I told my friends to please start with out me.\n\nMy friend's chicken was way too salty; we all tried it and agreed. We called the waiter over and tried to explain but he didn't understand so the owner came over and I believe he thought we were complaining that there was too much sauce. We decided to switch to pot stickers instead. Still no Hunan fish!\n\nFinally about 20 minutes after the first dish came out I got my lunch. It was very good but I thought a little soy sauce might make it even better so had to ask for it, they don't have the condiments on the tables.\n\nFinally the pot stickers came out and they were the best I've ever had. We wanted to put vinegar on them so we had to ask for it because they don't have the condiments on the tables!\n\nThe food was good but the service was a catastrophe. My friends that go there a lot say it isn't usually like that so I'll give them another try and they could very well get another star out of me. \n\nOne bit of advice though; ask for all of the condiments as soon as you sit down so you don't have to wait for them later.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-08-17"}, {"excerpts": ["These dishes have that heavy sauce: general Tso's chicken, eric's chow mein, mongolian beef, broccoli & beef."], "author": "Patrick L.", "review": "not sure why most of the dishes have that dark heavy sauce. too bold.

Lots of whole garlic cloves were included that were really tasty.\n- Some Eggplant Stir Fry - Probably my least favorite dish, because it was the saltiest. It was also almost exactly the same as the garlic shrimp dish (same sauce), and also included shrimp, so we felt like we were eating pretty much the same thing again.\n- String Bean w/ Fried Tofu - Liked this dish.

However, I hate American-Chinese food -- especially when it's full-service restaurant-style.

All the people who are saying that this is \"authentic\" Chinese food are most certainly not of Chinese-decent. Sure they may have authentic Chinese-named dishes, but the taste is definitely not authentic. Still, though, there are American-Chinese restaurants that really do serve great food -- Eric's is not one of them.\n\nThe string beans with bean curd was horrible -- dry, tasteless, tough. The Ocean's Delight was mediocre at best (the crispy noodle nest that it comes in was insanely stale). The Eric's bread (which is basically green onion pancake topped with peanut sauce) was decent, but it was definitely concocted for an American tongue -- you will never find such a combination in China. The spicy chicken with basil was not spicy whatsoever (throwing jalapenos into a wok is NOT Chinese spice). Even the white rice was mushy and overcooked. How the hell does a Chinese restaurant not know how to make a decent pot of white rice?!\n\nThe service was good for a Chinese restaurant and they served wine, which is always a plus. It's also very clean, which may be a plus for most people, but I like my Chinese restaurants dirty and delicious.\n\nAll in all, Eric's just isn't a good Chinese restaurant.

I love eggplant!  The tofu was very tasty and cooked perfectly with a lightly crisped exterior and warm and juicy interior.

They had several interesting choices on the lunch side so I decided to stick with that. It's not your typical Chinese place, kind of upscale, so a $6 lunch seemed like a great deal.\n\nEverything started fine. We sat down and were given soup and hot tea. One of my friends asked for hot oil, they don't have the condiments on the tables. The soup was a very bland egg drop type thing with lots of tofu and carrots; I didn't like it. After about ten minutes, that is hours in soup time, my friend had to ask for the hot oil again. I tried a bit of oil in the soup but it really didn't improve it much. I tried to eat around the tofu as best I could but left most of it in the bowl.\n\nWhen they took our order I asked what the waiter recommended and he suggested the Hunan fish. One of my friends ordered a chicken broccoli and cashew dish and the other ordered an eggplant and shrimp thing that wasn't on the lunch menu.\n\nFirst they brought out the eggplant dish and then the chicken lunch. My friends were sharing so one took some rice off of the plate and the other one started to eat the chicken when the waiter came and took the plate away. He came back with a brand new one and put it down in front of my friend with the only explanation being \"you order spicy\". I was left sitting there with no food and no plate to put any of the already served food on. I told my friends to please start with out me.\n\nMy friend's chicken was way too salty; we all tried it and agreed. We called the waiter over and tried to explain but he didn't understand so the owner came over and I believe he thought we were complaining that there was too much sauce. We decided to switch to pot stickers instead. Still no Hunan fish!\n\nFinally about 20 minutes after the first dish came out I got my lunch. It was very good but I thought a little soy sauce might make it even better so had to ask for it, they don't have the condiments on the tables.\n\nFinally the pot stickers came out and they were the best I've ever had. We wanted to put vinegar on them so we had to ask for it because they don't have the condiments on the tables!\n\nThe food was good but the service was a catastrophe. My friends that go there a lot say it isn't usually like that so I'll give them another try and they could very well get another star out of me. \n\nOne bit of advice though; ask for all of the condiments as soon as you sit down so you don't have to wait for them later.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-08-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Hunan fish, Walnut Prawns and everything else on the menu.

It's not a fancy place, although you'll find people dressed business casual, to just casual. But it's also not a dive. Tables are draped in white cloth with votive candles, for that bistro feel... The large picturesque windows give you a view of one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco. And if you've ever entered this place from a wintery rainy evening; it sets a beautiful mood as your enjoying your hot & sour soup, while looking out at the wet and rainy streets.\n\nEric's is just a great place to have a nice \"fresh and clean\" tasting meal.

More than enough food for three of us, and with enough left overs for two to eat lunch the following day.\n\nThe Vegetarian Egg Rolls looked crisp and delicious, although I did not indulge.  The Crab Rangoon, arrived a bit chewy and luke warm, as if they took a little trip through the microwave and then sat for a few minutes.  At the very least they should arrive crisp if not piping hot and crisp, they arrived neither which was quite disappointing.  We also had the Spicy Eggplant, which was \"egg\"ceptional, some of the best spicy eggplant I've had... AWESOME!  The spicy fried tofu with fried greens and pine nuts, was also quite good.  We ordered the Scallops with Szechwan Sauce and Broccoli as the non-vegetarian option.  This was at best average, drowned in sauce, and lacking scallops.  It is better described as Szechwan Sauce with Broccoli and some Scallops. \n\nI wanted to love Eric's, but it just didn't measure up to my expectations.  I will give it another shot, as my dining companions have dined here in the past and enjoyed those experiences.  Here's to hoping this was a weird off night fluke.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-09-24"}], "fresh clams with black bean sauce": []}
