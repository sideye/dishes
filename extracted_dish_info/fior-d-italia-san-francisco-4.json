The decor is very old school and laid back. In my opinion, it needs a bit of upgrade and maintenance. The floors creak when you walk and the carpet looked quite dirty. Apparently, it is one of the oldest Italian restaurants in the United States. Might as well hold the position high! \n\nOnce we were seated, we were served with some complimentary bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar that were already on the table. I'm not sure if the bread was supposed to be that way but it was quite rough in texture. We were in for some light dinner and chose Caesar salad and Tortellini alla Panna. I don't think there is any way to mess up the salad so it was nice but the Tortellini was very bland. My palate was craving for some spice and all I got was cheese!

That's because it was considered fancy eating for someone barely making enough to keep warm in a studio apartment. It used to be where Original Joe's is now across from Washington Square Park, but for the past decade, it's been up a few blocks on Mason in the San Remo Hotel. After passing by it, usually after a hearty meal at Albona around the corner, Jamie W. and I finally tried it just before Christmas, and it brought back warm memories of my penny-saving youth. The prices are still not bad by San Francisco standards.\n\nAnyway, we were seated toward the back of the dining room as a jazz ensemble was finishing up near the front window (photo: http://bit.ly/2j9z6XO). There was quite an audience of enraptured regulars singing and snapping along with the Christmas swing standards the band played. We enjoyed it from where we were but honestly focused primarily on the menu. A big hunk of rustic sourdough bread landed on our table which we surrounded with quite a pool of olive oil and red wine vinegar (photo: http://bit.ly/2imF1I5). For a starter, we didn't go wrong with the $16 Burrata con Pomodori Basilico e Olio (Burrata with Tomato, Basil and Virgin Olive Oil) (photo: http://bit.ly/2j9FBtr).\n\nVery fresh mozzarella surrounded by tomato slices and olives resting on basil leaves with a bit of frisee on top. Delicious. We also did well with our pasta entrees. Jamie had the $17 Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was eggy with just the right amount of meat sauce to satisfy a true carnivore who would otherwise bypass the bistecca (photo: http://bit.ly/2ja9cU6). I went for the more luxuriant $17 Tortellini alla Panna stuffed with chicken and swimming a bit in lighter-than-expected cream sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2j3f9jq), Thank goodness we ordered the $12 Funghi di Selva Trifolati, a medley of three wild mushroom sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and parsley (photo: http://bit.ly/2imy0a6).\n\nI quickly mixed it up with the tortellini to enhance my dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2jm8rEM).

With a straight cup of coffee (photo: http://bit.ly/2imHlPf), it provided just the right finale as the ensemble had already packed up and went home.

Since this was our first time at the new location on Mason, in fact, I didn't know until recently that Fd'I had reopened after the fire of 2005. As soon as I saw it is still in existence, I have been craving Spaghetti Amatriciana.\n\nMy introduction to the spicy Amatriciana sauce was twenty or more years ago when Fd'I was located on Washington Square. Amatriciana is what I ordered on my first visit to Fd'I and the only dish ordered there until the fire mentioned above. \n\nI love spicy food, and this sauce packed quite a punch. In fact, I was amazed that an Italian restaurant in California would serve a sauce so heavily laced with cayenne and pepper flakes. It turned my face a Marinara-red, and I had to wipe the sweat from my brow, but with my Cajun roots prevailing, I relished every bite. I've learned since that this sauce isn't always easy to find on the menus of other Italian restaurants, but when it was listed, nothing else on the menu matters, I know what I'm having. But I never found a restaurant that could satisfy my palate with a spicy Amatriciana like that from the kitchen of Fd'I.\n\nO and I  arrived for an early dinner, around 4:00 p.m. The jazz band was playing to a small but enthusiastic audience of diners. It was the lull between lunch and dinner. We were greeted and escorted to our table by a pleasant and swarthily attractive host. As we followed our dishy host,  I delighted in the sound of the creaking floors and live jazz. This restaurant occupies the ground floor of one of the city's oldest hotels, The San Remo, a proud Victorian Italianate, and I would have been extremely disappointed had the walk to our table been without creaks. Some of us cling desperately to the remaining charm in San Francisco, and this is the kind of Victorian splendor we find intoxicating.\n\nTo me, this space seemed brighter than the former Washington Square location, but it is certainly not without charm. On our visit, it was a gloriously sunny afternoon in North Beach, so the large window that looks out onto Mason behind Leon Oakley's band filled the dining room with light. \n\nAnother gorgeous, swarthy young man appeared with a big basket of bread. Paradiso! We found Paradiso! It was abundantly clear that we were in for a titillating dining experience. I didn't ask the young man's name because I'm far too old and way too shy so I'll call him, Roman. O and I each ordered the Venesia Martinis, aka Trixie's, from Roman off the House Cocktail Menu and proceeded to enjoy the bread.\n\nThe bread was exactly what I expect from an Italian restaurant: rustic, crispy crust and moist and flavorful inside. If you don't hear a sound and if it doesn't make a huge crumbly mess when you tear into Italian bread, well, just open a bag of Wonder and knock yourself out. Fd'I's pane hit the mark. Bull's Eye!\n\nOne sip of the Venezia Martini and O and I were hooked! It came with a slice of marinated pear that was, well, sublime. We asked Roman about the pear, he smiled (and what a smile) like he had heard this before and said we might want to try it later in a house-made dessert which turned out to be Pera Caramellata with Passito di Pantelleria. Roman could have sold me the Coliseum and a Ferrari factory-slash-garlic-farm in Gilroy. We had planned to switch to wine with our meal, but there was no way I wasn't going to order another Trixie and O felt the same.\n\nI was enjoying a bowl of Minestrone and O a Cesar Salad when Roman appeared, like a vision with 6 o'clock shadow, Bucatini Amatriciana in hand. I place an order for two more Trixies. Sorry, Bacchus.\n\nAnd the jazz played on.\n\nOkay, the Amatriciana was not as I remembered. It was far less spicy. But I believe this is because people with sensitive palates dismissed the descriptive word \"spicy\" on the menu, ordered it then after the first bite, likely complained, some fainted and some, I suspect sued. So, of course, they had to tone it down. But it was still better than I'd had at other restaurants.  Next time, I'll ask Roman if he can crank the heat up a notch or two and I'm sure he'll accommodate.\n\nDessert: Pera Caramellata with Passito di Pantelleria. Have it!\n\nWhat a marvelous dining experience. The service, the music, the food and the cocktails, the seven o'clock shadow, the decor and the history...

A+ on the cocktails!\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Caesar Salad ($7) and Roasted Potatoes ($7). The salad was soaked in dressing (maybe a little too much) but was flavorful and filling. The potatoes (cut into the shape of rounds) were good but the fact that they were sitting in a giant puddle of olive oil was not very appealing.\n\nOnto the entr\u00e9es. I'm generally a huge fan of Pumpkin Ravioli so I ordered the Ravioli di Zucca ($16) which is pasta stuffed with pumpkin, amaretti and mustard fruit with a butter, pinenuts and sage sauce. YUM!

In my humble opinion that's why many of these TV programs featuring restaurant \"makeovers\" involve Italian restaurants.  I think that Italian chefs use recipes handed down for generations and have very personal touches.  If you order dish \"A\" in a place and order the same thing in another place, they may have the same core ingredients but the flavor palette may be entirely different.\n\nI have a friend who thinks genuine \"Italian\" food starts and stops with spaghetti and meatballs.  The Fior D'Italia doesn't eschew those \"American staples\" but has enough variety to suit anyone and everyone.  I went there the other night for the first time since Chef Gianni took over the place and reopened (hence I'm treating this as a new review rather than an update).    Service was spot on attentive, bread hot and water glasses filled and coffee replenished.  I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  I was impressed by the fact that one of our party, a vegetarian, was able to get a \"special\" dish just by asking the waiter (Donny) politely if it was possible.  No problem.\n\nI always read the bad reviews just to get a sense of how a place clicks.  I noticed many were because some coupons from a few years back aren't redeemable under the new owner.   I remember the old owner - a heck of a nice fellow but  prone to giving out coupons and free dinners (I had a free dinner there myself several years ago).  That may be patriotic or civic minded but it impacts negatively on the bottom line.  Personally I would never expect a coupon more than a year old to be honored and don't think anyone else should either.  Kudos to Chef Gianni for trying to make things right  with people that do try to use them.\n\nI had a mixed green salad for starters and the saltimbocca (literally jumps in your mouth) for the main course.  The presentation was excellent and the taste was very exquisite.  This dish could be very bland in the hands of an unskilled chef but Gianni's kitchen did a outstanding job.  There were some potatoes and asparagus to complete the dish - not so much as to waste but definitely enough to satisfy.  My wife had the veal chop (Cotoletta alla Piemontese) and it was huge.

The food was hot, tasty and delicious.  The menu has been cut back from what it was but that's a good thing as it allows them to focus.  The bar seems to be a local neighborhood hangout.  I understand they serve finger food but I didn't try any so my  comments are based on my experience.

There was quite an audience of enraptured regulars singing and snapping along with the Christmas swing standards the band played.

Good to rediscover a San Francisco institution and still be able to recommend it.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...classic Italian fare, well remembered, still well executed\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...big space, enough for a jazz combo and tables of fans\nSERVICE - 4 stars...young waiter who respects old traditions\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely worthwhile to come back to a proven North Beach spot", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-11"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered Funghi di Selva Trifolati.

Our waiter was not terribly helpful. It took him forever to come to our table and he never checked in with us to see how everything was. This was at around 4:30 PM on a work day, he was not overwhelmed or busy in any way. I had lasagna and my friend had the Risotto alla Piemontese. The lasagna was absolutely horrible. I could not find a morsel of meat in it and the sauce was an orangish color. It was the kind of thing that you know was put together in an unthoughtful lazy way. No layering of b\u00e9chamel, bolognesem and pasta was attempted.  The frozen stuff you get at the grocery store is far superior.  The Risotto was not bad, but subpar for a restaurant that advertises itself as 'fine dining'. We also ordered Funghi di Selva Trifolati. Which is basically an assortment of three wild mushrooms saut\u00e9d in garlic and parsley. You think they could not mess this up? Yes they can and they did. This was very pungent. I do not mean garlicky pungent, but very old mushroom pungent. It was really not edible. After the horid dining experience, we decided to skip the desert and jolt out of there as fast as possible. The atmosphere is old school Italian without any attempt to update or clean it up.
