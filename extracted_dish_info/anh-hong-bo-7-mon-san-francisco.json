First course is beef salad. The second course is beef fondue. It's more like you boil the raw beef yourself. The next 4 course came all together, coz, I guess, they are similar kind of food? They include 3 kinds of beef sausages and one huge beef meat ball. And all these came with mixed vegetables, cucumber, bean sprouts and carrots, most importantly, the rice sheets!!! What you have to do is take a piece of dry rice sheet and immerse it in a bowl of water in a circular motion, and then take it out put it on your plate. Then you can start to put vegetables, beef and sauce on it. (btw, their sauces are really stinky but good @@)  By the time you are ready to wrap those stuff all together, the rice sheet is already softened like what you had with spring rolls =D, this will only take a minute or two. So now you just wrap it and eat! The last course is the beef congee, kind similar with those Cantonese dim sum kind congee.  \n\nIt was fun and the food was so tasty, oh, did I mention it's cheap too. 4 of us, ordered 2 of the seven courses of beef and a raw beef in vinegar appetizer, which was also really good.

While there are other dishes here, like vermicelli or pho, it seemed like everyone in the restaurant knew that they wanted the seven course beef. And after trying the seven course beef, this would be the only thing I could ever get at Anh Hong.\n\nMe and 3 other friends came in around 5:30, and was seated promptly. We were all eager to try the seven course beef, so we only ordered that and some drinks such as thai tea, yuja cha, and coconut milk.\n\nSurprisingly, seven course beef isn't as meat heavy as one would expect. There is a large plate of carrots, cilantro, mint, radish, and lettuce. If you ever run out, you only need to ask the workers to receive more vegetables. The seven course beef also came with a lot of a lot of rice paper (which you dip into water to make it softer), and some fish sauce and anchovies sauce.\n\nMoving onto the main attraction, the seven course beef.\n\nThe Seven course beef has:\nBeef Salad,\nbeef fondue(beef hot pot),\n3 types of beef sausages (with shrimp chips),\nbeef meatloaf,\nand beef rice porridge(congee).\n\nThe beef salad was very good in my opinion. The beef salad has very strong mint taste. I thought it was going to be raw beef salad, but it was in fact a cooked beef salad. It was quite good, nothing mind blowing but it was a nice minty beef salad.\nThe beef fondue was just OK, but not as great as the salad. I personally thought the broth didn't have enough flavor, because when i cooked the beef in the fondue the fondue did not enhance the beef very much.\nIn my opinion, the main dish of the seven course beef is the giant platter of sausage and meatloaf, which has shrimp chips on top. This was definitely the best part of the seven course beef. Each sausage had a distinct taste, for example, one sausage had a thin slice of pork wrapped around it, another has a taro leaf wrapped around it, and the last one had a lemongrass taste. Each of these sausages were good by itself, but it really came alive when you wrapped a sausage with rice paper and put some vegetable with some fish/anchovy sauce on top.\nThe shrimp chips were fried well as well, so I enjoyed them very much.\nThe meatloaf was very fluffy, it almost tasted like meat flavored eggs. I personally didn't think the meatloaf was very good, but it added a different texture and taste.\nThe last dish was the rice porridge(congee) with beef. In my opinion, this had much to be desired. The congee was plain, and there was no beef taste. This congee might be a good cleansing dish, and that might have been the point. \n\nOverall, I would be very excited to recommend this to any group of two or more. This is a really fun experience.

The one with the 714 area code? But I'd never eaten this infamous and amazingly orchestrated meal before. \n\nThe fact that very few pictures were snapped (none by me at all) bears testament to the scrumptious things that you can do with beef.

I couldn't get enough of it - and the flavor was luxurious and perfectly complemented by the quick marinade, not at all overwhelmed. \n\nA generous salad was tangy and crisp... which I piled onto my plate and into the baskets full of rice paper \"frisbees\" that you dampen in a bowl of hot water, circling, circling, circling... until \"al dente\" - they continue to soften once you place them on your plate and start filling them up with all manner of goodies which will tempt your palate. \n\nThe imperial rolls were petite and full of meaty flavor without being greasy at all... but still, very rich.

One thing that Pagolac had that Anh Hong doesn't is the grilled beef slices, which I would have much preferred instead of either the beef pate or the beef rolls w/ ginger. Pagolac does spice things up with allowing you to cook your own meat -- but when it comes to quality, Anh Hong wins bar-none. \n\nThe cha gio was insanely good. Much better than at Pagolac or most other Vietnamese restaurants for that matter. I love how it comes with the vermicelli. The grilled pork was also really tasty.\n\nThis is how good the food at Anh Hong is: during dinner, I found a nasty fly floating around in my fish sauce. I told the waiter and he just took away my bowl without so much as a \"sorry\". Even a \"oops, my bad\" would have sufficed. Usually this would be the defining moment where I claim that I had a horrible experience and vow to never come back.\n\nYeah...

Either wrap or eat alone.  I chose to eat alone.  Have to practice my chopstick holding anyway.  Failed miserably.\n\n5)  Beef Pate.  With this you get shrimp chips to load up with the pate.\n\n6)  Two kinds of rolled up beef things.  Don't know what they are, but they are great!  One is rolled in a grape leaf maybe?  Closest thing to is is Lumpia Shanghai.   Another was kind of like a spring roll, but I did not see any wrapper.  This had glass noodles in it maybe?\n\n7)  Last, and not least, is a soothing Beef Soup, with just a hint of ginger.  Just the thing to aid in digesting all that protein.\n\nAll this for $17.95.

It was validating to see traditional Vietnamese salad ingredients such as basil, mint, red onions, and carrots - all julienned or finely chopped. They even served two sauce options, both fish sauce-based and very delicious.\n\nThe second dish is a favorite in most Vietnamese households and is so very refreshing: beef fondue with special vinegar sauce. The dish is served with slices of raw tenderloin beef, an overflowing plate of greens, and pickled veggies. To eat, you just cook the beef in the fondue pot and then make a spring roll with the cooked beef, greens, and pickled veggies. Dipping sauces are the same as the salad above.\n\nThe third, fourth, fifth and sixth courses all arrived at the same time on one platter. It was a sight to behold! One item was steamed beef pate - delicious meat balls mixed with nuts, mushrooms and various Vietnamese spices. Another item was grilled beef sausage with a flavor that made me miss Grandmother's cooking. An item I don't think I've ever had was the beef wrapped in Hawaiian leaf. This was also mind boggling. But my absolute favorite of this combo was the slices of tenderloin in lemon grass and green onion and grilled to tender perfection. \n\nBy the time the seventh and final course arrived, I was ready to burst.

Created as recently as the 1950's by the progenitors of Anh Hong's owners\u00ba\u00ba, Bo 7 Mon is now widely served at Vietnamese wedding banquets, as well as restaurants throughout the world. The influence of this feast is not only far-reaching, but has been propagated in a relatively short period of time. It is the aim of this paper not to examine the meal's influence upon culture, but culture's influence upon the meal.\n\n\n Before continuing, it is important to identify the components of Bo 7 Mon, as presented by Anh Hong. Please note that other restaurants may present the dishes in a different order, or with several different components altogether.\n\n\n Bo 7 Mon is comprised of Goi Bo (a beef salad mixed with assorted vegetables), Bo Dung Dam (beef fondue in which slices of raw tenderloin are dipped in a hot pot of vinegar sauce), Bo Cha Dum (steamed beef pate with nuts and mushrooms), Bo Moi Chai (grilled beef sausages), Bo La Lot (mince beef wrapped in Lot leaf), Bo Nuong Sa (grilled beef roulades around scallion, flavored with lemongrass), and Chao Bo (beef rice soup with scallions, ginger and lemongrass).\n\n\n The first and most obvious element of Bo 7 Mon is Bo or, more simply, beef. While Chinese cuisine serves as the basis of Vietnamese cooking (i.e. the use of broths, noodles, and the extensive incorporation of rice), the consumption of beef is representative of the vast influence of the Mongol empire, namely the Mongolian invasion of the 13th century.+\n\n\n Furthermore, the Khmer influence from neighboring Cambodia brought forth the use of what is commonly referred to now as small plates, as opposed to large, centralized meals.+\n\n\n Taking the above-named influences and mating them with the abundance of fresh vegetables and herbs and rich fishing waters of the Mekong Delta has resulted in much of the Vietnamese cuisine that survives to this day. Thus, one is commonly able to consume beef accompanied by rice noodles, rice wrappers, fish sauce, carrots, daikon, sprouts, mint, and basil at any of thousands of Vietnamese food outlets.\n\n\n The brutal French occupation of Vietnam from 1858 to 1954 resulted in much bloodshed and colonialist fallout, as documented in various historical studies. In terms of foodways, it had the more positive effect of widening the scope of Vietnamese cuisine by introducing French cooking techniques and customs. The Bo Nuong Sa is an exemplary dish, using native lemongrass to flavor thinly julienned green onions wrapped in a tightly rolled beef roulade,++ a cooking method unused in the region before the occupation.\n\n\n It was also the French proclivity to serve meals in multiple courses that influenced the Bo 7 Mon consumed by millions of Vietnamese today. Per the research of Steel,\u00ba\u00ba the proprietor of Anh Hong's great grandmother wanted to introduce French-style, multicourse meals to Vietnam.\n\n\n As uncovered further in these field studies, it is common practice to drink Vietnam's 33 Export beer as a gustatory enhancement for Bo 7 Mon. Research into the background of 33 reveals further French influence, as well as Dutch. 33 is a beverage brewed by an arm of Netherlands-based Heineken International that specializes in the manufacture of beer in former French colonies, such as Vietnam and Morroco#. (Previous work by this researcher has found that 33 in Morocco is identical to 33 from Vietnam.)\n\n\n It can thus be gleaned that the components and the whole of Bo 7 Mon (and its accompanying beverages) as found at Anh Hong exemplify regional and colonial influences on modern Vietnamese culture, and that foodways are indeed a suitable means of examining a culture.\n\n\n While it would be irresponsible to condone invasion and occupation, or to make light of people's struggles against said invaders and occupiers, it can be scientifically concluded that the Chinese, Mongolian, and French sacking of Vietnam have resulted in something truly delicious.\n\n\n Sources:\n\u00ba Jaffe and Fredericksen, 2005; \u00ba\u00ba Steel, 2006; + Civil, 1995; ++ Pepin, 1976; # Heineken International annual report, 2006", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-07-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Roll up into a little cigar and dip in your choice of sauce (regular fish sauce, or something that sounds like mum nem, which has anchovy paste or shrimp paste or something like that, and is more tasty; i also dump in a bit of chili sauce) and eat.

Since we were a bit early, we decided to sneak a cocktail down the street at Rye before dinner.

I never come for the ambiance anyways.  \n\nLike many other people say, you have to order the 7 course beef dinner.  You will be stuffed and extremely content.  Basically, you just get 7 huge dishes of beef pastes, sausages, skewers, etc... with different wraps and rice noodles.  Dip them all in the fish sauce.  There's also a really good soup that comes with it.  I could be wrong about what was exactly on the menu because we had a friend order for us.  I know we did the 7 courses though.  \n\nI think the price is really good too.  It was about $20+ per person for dinner.  Great price considering how good the food was and how much we got.  If you can't speak vietnamese, ask the waiters to help you order.  \n\nI've also come here for just 5 courses of the beef dinner and was pretty stuffed so you will have plenty of food.

However, if you love beef, read on.\n\nIn the latest Yelp event sponsored by Connie and Shatangi (did I even see Shatangi??!!), we hit this place up.   The 7 course beef meal is not to be missed.  Don't think you will be in a meat coma after eating a five pound steak.  This is Vietnamese food, and is light and lively.\n\nThe meal includes:\n\n1)  Beef Salad ... Think of it like \"Chinese\" Chicken Salad.  Fantastic!\n\n2)  Beef Hot Pot.  You get a pot of soup, veggies, and a plate of raw beef.  You can figure out what to do next!  Also you get rice paper, and a bowl of hot water to soften them up in.  Fill it with beef, veggies, lettuce, bean sprouts, etc.  Take the 1..2..3.. sauce, which are cups of anchovy paste, fish sauce, and chili sauce.  Great!\n\n3)  Char grilled Beef.  Do the same thing ... fill the rice paper.  Also with this is calamari, shrimp and chicken.\n\n4)  Beef Sausage!  About two inch long grilled sausage, not to sweet or salty.  YUM!  Either wrap or eat alone.  I chose to eat alone.  Have to practice my chopstick holding anyway.  Failed miserably.\n\n5)  Beef Pate.  With this you get shrimp chips to load up with the pate.\n\n6)  Two kinds of rolled up beef things.  Don't know what they are, but they are great!  One is rolled in a grape leaf maybe?  Closest thing to is is Lumpia Shanghai.   Another was kind of like a spring roll, but I did not see any wrapper.  This had glass noodles in it maybe?\n\n7)  Last, and not least, is a soothing Beef Soup, with just a hint of ginger.  Just the thing to aid in digesting all that protein.\n\nAll this for $17.95.  Great deal for good food, and it actually is pretty light and not too filling.\n\nMy roommate was texting me all evening wondering what I was going to bring home.  When was I coming, are you done YET??!!  The kitchen was closed when I place a to-go order, the they made a combo grill anyway.  1 additional star!  She tore into the box, and devoured the grill plate plus the extra rolls from our table.  So that must be good too.
