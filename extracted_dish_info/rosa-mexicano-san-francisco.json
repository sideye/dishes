The restaurant is set up in a way I think Bobby Berk from Queer Eye, you know the one who flips houses, would appreciate. \n\nNow it is time for the food. I first started out with ceviche, which I was swimming in it. The guacamole was so thick and creamy I wanted to rub it all over my body; you know millennials and guac. Since it was a lunch date and Friday I didn't want to gorge myself with food. I had people to impress later on that night. So I orders some tacos, and let me just say the tacos and I had a moment. As I was sitting there eating some juicy meat, I couldn't help but wonder... what would be the icing on top of a fantastic lunch?

We were promptly greeted by the smiling hostess who asked if there were any vegetarians in the party so she could bring the additional menu.  She had a great smile and made us feel very welcome.  This time I dined with my family and my mom was present, Party of 4.  We were promptly greeted with a friendly smile, chips, salsa (amazing , chunky and flavorful) and water.  The server asked if we dined there before and welcomed us back.  Suggested the guacamole to start, the cart was rolled over to the table and a beautiful mocajete was the foundation of our soon to be devoured perfect guacamole.  I was telling the table the queso fundido was to die for, so we ordered that as a second appetizer.  When the cast iron skillet of ooey' gooey melted deliciousness was brought to the table, we served our mom first with one of the perfectly cooked and homemade I might add, corn tortilla.  I mean honestly, if butter was served with them, I would have proposed.  The peppers in the queso fundido add a small amount of heat and the vibrant green cilantro adds a freshness to the melted, salty, creamy cheese we were about to enjoy.  Two native Texans agreed the cheer was authentic and clearly imported!  We talked mom (really had to twist her arm) into ordering a Paloma cocktail, this is the cocktail I had, ok fine, a few I had when I was there the first time in my date.  A very mild and smooth tequila with red grapefruit juice, the rim covered in their original concoction of amazing.  A must try!\n\nWe then moved on to entrees, after all the apps I had the chicken tortilla soup which was absolutely delightful.  It is a unique soup here because the broth is more of a sauce (like a red enchilada sauce) with moist and flavorful chicken, plenty of cheese, tortilla strips and fresh cilantro.  Mom had the tinga de res tacos, which were served with a very generous portion of flavorful, juicy and well seasoned meat.  Of course the home made corn tortillas were divine!  The pickled red onions was a great addition of acidity to the tacos!  I love that they serve the tacos on a plate with the cool taco stand so the tacos stay upright, whoever invented this was pure genius.  The others had the Arrachera which was a perfectly cooked medium, with a warm pink center served a top beautifully grilled green and red peppers and onions, oh and I did I forget to mention, more cheese?  It was also served with two other salsas, a green tomatillo salsa, which had a sweet note and a fiery red salsa that had heat.  The entrees were also served with perfectly cooked, fluffy and well seasoned Mexican rice and black beans (retired style).  Both were a great accompaniment to the meal and we were all very impressed with the flavor extracted from the beans and rice.  \n\nLastly our outstanding waiter suggested churros for dessert, he painted a picture I could taste, but unfortunately we were stuffed from the lunch.  We will definitely be back to enjoy the rest of the menu and our new found favorites!  \n\nI hope you give this amazing restaurant a try, it is only two blocks from Embarcadero BART stop and they have a great outdoor eating area and bar area!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-04-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Also enjoyed the Partida Paloma cocktail.

The restaurant is close to home for me, a short walk. I had a reservation through OpenTable, and was quickly seated.\n\nI really like the interior of this restaurant. It has a fun color scheme, with lots of eye candy - artistic lighting fixtures, earthy colors, and the divers leaping off the waterfall is certainly creative (see pictures). Music is a mix of modern latin flavor & downtempo, I liked it a lot. Sadly I didn't hear Vamos A La Playa, not even once. (I'm joking.)\n\nOn the Dine About Town menu, they list the table-side guacamole. Unfortunately, you can't get that unless you're a party of two, using your mutual two first course options to get the guacamole. Or, you can pay $7 more to get it as a single eater. It normally costs $14, so I guess I can understand that, considering the whole DAT lunch is $18.95. The way they word this on the menu is not the best, and I can see how it would disappoint some people. Generally when I get guacamole prepared at a table, the waiter brings over avocados, salsa, lime, other fixins & the container to crush everything in in a small hand held tray or basket, makes it, takes the tray or basket & leaves. At Rosa Mexicano, they have a cart they wheel to your table, a little retro, but everything on the cart looks tasty. They prepare your guacamole with some of the biggest avocados I've ever seen (I watched as another table got theirs); I believe Bruce Willis shot down the errant asteroid in Armageddon with one of those. I'm sure it was delicious, I love fresh guac.\n\nThe chips came with two salsas, a red salsa that got a smoky flavor from some of the chiles used, and a green salsa that was milder. That said, have a glass of water or drink ready to go. The sauces are delicious, so you eat a lot of them, but the spicy heat will sneak up on you & all of a sudden you realize you need water.\n\nMy first course was flautas de pollo, which are rolled crispy chicken tacos (think taquitos), covered in red & green salsas, Mexican cheese & sour cream. These were delicious, with so many different flavors, spices, and heat & cooling levels (physical & spice level).\n\nSecond course was enchiladas rancheras, cheese enchiladas in a roasted tomato sauce. From my photo you would not think these were different than what you're used to, but they are. Once again, there are a variety of subtle flavors & spices that hit you. The cheese doesn't entirely melt, and both the cheese & corn tortilla give texture to the dish. This is served with a healthy bowl of refried black beans, which seemed very fresh, unlike some Mexican restaurants where refried beans can taste dried out & generally old. They also include a bowl of brown rice. Now normally, brown rice tastes flavorless & sad, like you're on a diet you hate. This rice was full of flavor, from the cilantro, mint, and chile it was prepared with. Once again, many subtle flavors playing on your palette.\n\nThird course, I got their pastel de queso, a cheesecake. Their cheesecake is light compared to what you're probably used to, and had a razor-thin slice of baked apple which gave a nice flavor. The cheesecake & plate had a drizzle of something that had a flavor & consistency somewhere between applesauce & caramel, hard to describe, but wonderful, and walnuts.\n\nThey're currently running \"The Art of Mexican Mixology,\" a special cocktail menu from Jun 5-30. I believe they do different events like this throughout the year. I tried their tequila sunrise, made with Herradura silver tequila, house-made pomegranate grenadine, and fresh orange juice. Two cherries on top of the glass... The staff assured me they were nothing special, but they tasted infused with an alcohol, or something... Not sure what. EVERYTHING at this restaurant tastes a little different, better than normal. They even had a recipe for it printed on a card attached to the bill, a nice touch.\n\nWaitstaff was attentive & friendly, and either knew the answer to my questions about what chile or spice I was sensing, or was willing to go find out. Water was always topped off; one of the guys was joking with me, that since he started eating there he drinks a lot more water. I believe it!\n\nI love Mexican food, and I really love fancy Mexican food when the chef plays with different chiles that all have different heat levels & spice flavors. This is a fantastic restaurant, and I'm lucky they're close to me. I throughly enjoyed every single thing I ate, and I will be back for more. It was literally difficult to wipe the smile from my face at the end of this feast, I felt so completely sated. Thank you for a wonderful meal.\n\n- Adam", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-06-08"}], "don fulano fuerte": [], "tromba blanco": [], "riazul plata": [], "milagro reposado": [], "hibiscus pomegranate iced tea": [], "strawberrymango": [], "cucumber mint refresco": [], "nonalcohol michelada": [], "jarritos grapefruit": [], "jarritos mandarin": [], "jarritos tamarind": [], "mexican cocacola": [], "pinot grigio principato trentino it": [], "albarino paco  lola rias baixas es": [], "sauvignon blanc haras maipo valley cl": [], "sauvignon blanc kim crawford marlborough nz": [], "chardonnay seven falls wahluke slope": [], "chardonnay sonomacutrer russian river sonoma": [], "white blend hugel gentil alsace fr": [], "riesling chateau ste michelle columbia valley": [], "riesling eroica columbia valley": [], "brut chandon napa ca nv  ml": [], "cava juv\u00e9 y camps penedes es": [], "champagne vueve cliquot brut reims fr nv": [], "pinot noir cono sur bicicleta rapel valley cl": [], "pinot noir robert mondavi carneros napa": [], "tempranillo torres coronas catalunya es": [], "tempranillo bodega numanthia numanthi toro es": [], "merlot tilia mendoza ar": [], "malbec terrazas mendoza ar": [], "malbec salentien reserve valle de uco mendoza ar": [], "cabernet sauvignon los vascos colchugua valley cl": [], "cabernet sauvignon jordan alexander valley": [], "ros\u00e9 jean luc colombo cape bleu provence fr": [], "michelada": [], "corona light": [], "negra modelo": [{"excerpts": ["Good service, interesting margs and cocktails (negra modelo + sangria?), huge bowls of guac, not too noisy, good layout and table space."], "author": "Sonya Z.", "review": "Good service, interesting margs and cocktails (negra modelo + sangria?), huge bowls of guac, not too noisy, good layout and table space.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-11-18"}], "modelo especial": [], "pacifico": [{"excerpts": ["$18 for2 Pacifico beers?!!
