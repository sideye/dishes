I'm always conflicted when we're about to leave for another restaurant because I catch the smell of their juicy Kalbi ribs.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe place gets super packed, but oddly enough, we got a table for 6 right away last time we came. Make sure you wear old clothes because you'll smell like Korean food when you leave.\n\nService is lacking, however. They turned me away once since I came at 9 and they closed at 9:30. They also forget to give you some of the free items such as the soup or the fried fish.\n\nThe food:\n\nWhat's great at Korean restaurants is the plethora of appetizers. You have the kimchi, pickled turnips, cucumbers, anchovies, fish cake, bean sprouts as well as kimchi tofu soup or a fried fish. I think the rule of thumb at this (and most) Korean restaurants is if you order soup, you get a fried fish; if you don't order soup, you get the house tofu soup.     Shin Toe Bul Yi does give seconds on the mini trays of appetizers - major plus in my book since I can't get enough of that fish cake.\n\nCalamari Bok (saut\u00e9ed rice cake, calamari and vegetables in spicy sauce) - This is my faaaavorite dish at this restaurant. It's made with 4-5\" pieces of the chewy rice cake saut\u00e9ed in a sweet and spicy sauce. I'm not big on calamari though, so I ate around it.\n\nPork Bul-Go-Gi (broiled lean pork marinated in spicy sauce) - This is K's favorite dish. The thin slices of pork are marinated in the same sweet and spicy sauce. The meat is very tender and has great flavor. The only thing that worries me about this dish is the bright red color; it doesn't seem natural.\n\nKal Bi (beef short rib marinated in house special sauce) - Koreans make some dang good short ribs. I just love their marinade. It's sweet, salty and spicy. This Kal Bi was much meatier than other Korean short ribs. Usually, a majority of the pieces are just fat and bones.\n\nChicken Small Pieces (deep fried) - Last but not least is the fried chicken - hands down, the most popular dish at the restaurant. It's not your typical fried chicken that you get at KFC or Popeyes. The chicken is very crispy. I'm pretty sure they use cornstarch rather than flour for their batter. The cornstarch brings the crunchiness to a whole other level. After the chicken has been deep fried, it's sprinkled with a spicy powder. One time I came here, we had a ton of chicken left over and I accidentally dropped 3 pieces on the floor when boxing it up.

It often gets smokey from the grill and they try to keep the door open to vent the smoke, so it can be cold and smokey.\n\nMy favorite is the Kal Bi; for the lunch special it is a pretty good deal. They serve nice Kim Chee too (actually, all the little side dishes [ban chan?] are pretty darn good)\n\nFor dinner it can get a little bit spendy, but the portions are good sized and the food really is excellent.  It is usually crowded at dinner time. They seem to get a lot of families. \n\nAbout the Fried Chicken - honestly, I tried it a while back and didn't see what was so special.

Big chunks of chicken, seasoned, battered, and deep fried GB&D (Golden brown and delicious-thanks Alton Brown). Its still tasty and juicy and the best bang for your buck for fried chicken @ $9.99 an order. \n\nThe seafood pancake was ehh.....nothing but mung bean batter, some green onion here and there and the only seafood in it was squid.

I prefer the one at My Tofu House more. \n\nKal bi is consistent, can't really go wrong with kal bi. \n\nThey didn't give us the complimentary vegetable pancake appetizer like they did before. Maybe it was because we had already ordered the seafood pancake, but I didn't see any other table receive it either. \n\nThe complimentary spicy tofu soup was lacking.

So as I was saying, the food here isn't the best, or bad, but because I live so close to this place, I usually just settle for it because I don't want to drive too far to into the richmond district just for some food. The soups are usually bland and watery, their meat dishes like the kal bi is usually burnt to the grilling plate, and their fishes have this nasty after taste, which typically means its not FRESH! The only upside to this place is their green onion pancake, but that alone is not enough to save this place. And after the last TWO times I've been here, I've had the WORST service ever. If I could give it 0 stars, I WOULD.\n\nThe first experience was with the old lady (probably the owner), who was a total B**** about an order of soup that my party and I DID NOT ORDER. She not only forced the soup that we did not order upon us, but had the audacity to charge us for it. Apparently she has a hearing problem, so the next time you go there and she's your server, be sure to SPEAK UP. \n\nThe second experience was tonight, and it was with the short/stubby  waitress. I was waiting in line with my sister, and we preferred to sit in the inside since the seat they offered us was in the front near the doors, plus my sister has kids. So we offered to wait for the table away from the door since they were practically paying the bill and ready to leave. After they finish cleaning, the stupid girl comes with her broken english and tells us that shes giving that table away when we clearly told her that we'll wait for THAT table. We asked her why, and she was like well... they're customers. I looked at her as if she was stupid or something because... HELLO, we're customers too!  Not only did it not make sense since she was giving a table that could have seated 6 (which was the size of my party) to a party of 2 instead. So my sister asked the dumb waitress politely if we could get the bigger table since we had a larger party and if the other party could get the table next to ours instead (which seated 4, which would have been perfect for the couple). Instead of even acknowledging our existence she just rolls her eyes and walks off, oblivious to everything. So we finally had it with this place, and we left, FOR GOOD.\n\nGoodbye Shin Toe Bul Yi, we've had enough of your BS service and your mediocre food. I would much rather drive my ass to the richmond district and be treated with respect at a better establishment than here. For those of you who don't mind being treated like garbage, and eating garbage, then feel free to come here, otherwise I would suggest My Tofu House, Han Il Kwan, Muguboka, or any other place than here because they either serve better or the same quality food as Shin Toe Bul Yi... but the only difference is at least you would be treated with respect. It's a different story if they served GREAT FOOD, then I guess it would be okay to treat your customers like garbage, but if you don't serve great food and your service sucks, then you have no right to treat anyone that way. \n\nP.S.

The outside sign is a bit tattered, the ambiance is just okay, and a few of the dishes won't appear to be mind blowing.  And yet, despite whatever shortcomings they may seem to have, the place is still so good!\n\nI'm not sure what exactly it is that makes them so lovable, but their fried chicken dish might have something to do with it.  Whenever I'm there, I see it show up on people's tables more often than not.   It's not something unique to their menu, but they do theirs a little differently.  Instead of just the usual wings and drumsticks, they also include chopped up pieces from the breast and thigh.  Though it makes for some awkward looking pieces, the taste is spot on!  The batter can be a little thick, but it's got some flavor, the portion is generous, and the meat is moist (for the most part).\n\nBeyond the fried chicken, the rest of their food is not too shabby, though nothing stands out as a star.  If anything, the haemul pajun (seafood pancake) would be the closest - loaded with a good amount of seafood, it wasn't too doughy and had a nice bit of crispiness.  Their broiled fish dishes are good, and the bulgogi is my favorite of their meats, but it's served as slices rather than chunks (it still tastes good though).  Sadly, I was disappointed with their kimchi jiggae (kimchi and pork stew) as it was too thin for my liking.\n\nIn addition to the usual array of banchan, I love that they hook you up with a free dish as well.  Depending on what you've already ordered, they'll usually give you a small pot of basic soon doobu, or a few pieces of mackarel(?).  Free food definitely goes a long way!

Doing KDer an xmas service and knocking down a restaurant off her endless bookmarks, we arrived at Shin To Bul Yi's door.  It was a monday night yet it was packed.  It is a very small restaurant and seems like it was converted from a residential house.  I advise going in groups to eat Korean food as it allows you to order more and sample each others plates.  We put our name on the list and huddled inside for warmth, staring at patron eating their food with doe eyes until we were shoo'd outside to wait in the cold.  Once seated, we ordered:\n\n1.  bulgogi: By far the best dish.  It was perfectly marinated, tender and juicy.  The portions were generous where all 5 of us had our way with the dish.  If i had it my way, i would have taken this dish all for myself.\n\n2.  kalbi: The kalbi was very flavorful.  There was a mention of how authentic this place was in terms of not being too Americanized.  The kalbi i love from john's snack and deli which comes in form of a kalbi burrito is very sweet.  Shin Toe Bul Yi's kalbi was subdued in sweetness and was also very good.  I preferred the bulgogi but there are no complaints about their kalbi.\n\n3.  tofu soup: The tofu soup was given to us on the house.  It was good for a cold night and not spicy at all.  There were generous portions of tofu and a good complement to pour over the rice.\n\n4.  fried chicken: The fried chicken was a house specialty and many yelpers have raved about it.  It is certainly good, but in controlled portions.  It is very fatty and rich and taste similar to KFC.  I could eat one or two pieces but after that, it was a little too much.\n\n5.  seafood pancake: I didn't touch this as I don't really eat seafood outside of fish.  This dish came at the tail end of our dinner so everyone else was much too stuffed to really put a dent in it.  \n\n6.  bimbimbap: My gf got the bimbimbap bowl for herself.

She said she was sorry, but they had just a few pieces left so they give it to that couple on the house. :( So sad was I. Then the waitress comes back with a plate of four pieces of chicken and told us that it was HER chicken that she was going to have for dinner! Needless to say, that chicken...was....so....good. \n\nIn conclusion, they really take care of you here; their food is good; its a small place and they sometimes will stop taking people if its nearing closing time.
