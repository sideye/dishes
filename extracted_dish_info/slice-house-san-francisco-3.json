Yeah probably but it's not like he's sold out and become a Food Network whore like Guy Fieri whose most current culinary connection is the excessive amount of carbs he can stuff in his ample mouth. Like many in our fair city, I became a fan when he opened his first San Francisco place, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, back in 2009. That's when my friend Maggie organized a birthday f\u00eate for me, and we tried a number of different pies including my eventual favorite, the Cal Italia with four Italian cheeses, prosciutto, a Croatian sweet fig preserve and a liberal drizzle of a balsamic reduction. Fantastico and then Jamie W. and I recently tried Tony's other North Beach Capo's for the first time.\n\nFantastico seconda parte. And then we found out Tony was taking over the former Ironside space on 2nd which thrilled us since he's now in our 'hood. This may be his third San Francisco operation, but he has since expanded his pizza empire from here to Vegas. Fantastico terza parte? Jamie and I decided to give it a try this past Friday and were surprised to find it nearly empty at about 6PM since there's plenty of beer on tap (photo: http://bit.ly/1byJErQ). I got here a bit earlier than Jamie, so you'll probably never guess what pizza I ordered for the two of us. The Cal Italia, of course (photo: http://bit.ly/1PQiKek). The ingredients were the same, but the crust was different. He bills it as \"Ancient Grain Pizza\" which represents a blend of Tony's double-zero flour, spelt, semolina, sprouted grain & whole wheat.\n\nThe result was probably healthier than the original but not quite as satisfying because of the chewier texture. You would think that would be enough for two mean with healthy appetites, but we were mindful of the name of the place, Slice House. With that in mind, I ordered a $6 square of the Sweet Grandma's Pizza, a Sicilian-style creation of which they make a limited number daily. It's really more a thick foccacia-like loaf with a sauce made of sweet, vine-ripened tomatoes ladled on top with mozzarella, garlic, oregano and pecorino (photo: http://bit.ly/1JwYGNf). While I appreciated the freshness of the ingredients, the breadiness overwhelmed me somewhat, so much so that for the first time, I could not finish a slice of Tony's pizza.\n\nJamie liked his $5.25 slice of the Pepperoni, and the slice was frankly enough for two with an abundance of meat (photo: http://bit.ly/1GCBVXt). My one complaint was the amount of grease that accumulated on the cheese probably because it spent some time saturating in the display case. Even with the focus on pizza, there were plenty of other items on the menu - salads, a couple of pasta specialties, paninis and apparently a meatball sub to die for according to the server who was pushing it hard.

He is also the first and only American to date to win the World Champion Pizza Maker at the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy, where he was the first non-Neapolitan to achieve such glory. Since then, he's opened up a lot of popular and successful pizza joints in North Beach and all over San Francisco, Sacramento and Las Vegas. He's also got one joint inside AT&T Park for all you Giants fans. I'm sure Timmy would love that joint after hitting the peace pipe. \n\nAfter attending a meeting at the ballpark, we were walking back to work and we were all getting hungry. We were undecided on where to go at first until we stumbled in front of this place. You can't go wrong with pizza so that three of us all walked in and started perusing the menu. You can get a slice or the whole pie or pan as they describe it ranging from Classic American, Italian, Sicilian and Neapolitan. They also have meatballs, chicken wings, garlic bread, salad, paninis and pasta to choose from.

Our pizzas arrived in a jiff and thank goodness since we were starving. I ordered the Grandma and it was a perfect name as it was like comfort food. These are not thin-sliced pizzas as the dough is fairly thick, but it's very light and fluffy. You can tell the sauce is made from fresh tomatoes and not from a can based on the texture and wonderful flavor. And the ingredients are portioned evenly giving it a good balance from dough to sauce to fillings. The meatballs were delicious and seasoned well. It was moist, meaty and manly. \n\nIt's another good addition to the neighborhood (no surprises here) as it's reasonably priced and they even have a Sunday Brunch special.

No toppings, no folding, just a firm bottom crust (that doesn't flop down) and parmesan cheese, red pepper fakes, oregano and garlic salt on top.  Most pizza by the slice is pretty bad in San Francisco.  Besides Tony's, Arinell is the only tolerable one out there.  At Slice House, it's almost like being back in NYC.  The crust is a little fluffier and they're a little more generous with cheese, but the sauce is spot on and the bottom of the crust is nice and firm from the oven reheating.

Yeah probably but it's not like he's sold out and become a Food Network whore like Guy Fieri whose most current culinary connection is the excessive amount of carbs he can stuff in his ample mouth. Like many in our fair city, I became a fan when he opened his first San Francisco place, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, back in 2009. That's when my friend Maggie organized a birthday f\u00eate for me, and we tried a number of different pies including my eventual favorite, the Cal Italia with four Italian cheeses, prosciutto, a Croatian sweet fig preserve and a liberal drizzle of a balsamic reduction. Fantastico and then Jamie W. and I recently tried Tony's other North Beach Capo's for the first time.\n\nFantastico seconda parte. And then we found out Tony was taking over the former Ironside space on 2nd which thrilled us since he's now in our 'hood. This may be his third San Francisco operation, but he has since expanded his pizza empire from here to Vegas. Fantastico terza parte? Jamie and I decided to give it a try this past Friday and were surprised to find it nearly empty at about 6PM since there's plenty of beer on tap (photo: http://bit.ly/1byJErQ). I got here a bit earlier than Jamie, so you'll probably never guess what pizza I ordered for the two of us. The Cal Italia, of course (photo: http://bit.ly/1PQiKek). The ingredients were the same, but the crust was different. He bills it as \"Ancient Grain Pizza\" which represents a blend of Tony's double-zero flour, spelt, semolina, sprouted grain & whole wheat.\n\nThe result was probably healthier than the original but not quite as satisfying because of the chewier texture. You would think that would be enough for two mean with healthy appetites, but we were mindful of the name of the place, Slice House. With that in mind, I ordered a $6 square of the Sweet Grandma's Pizza, a Sicilian-style creation of which they make a limited number daily.

While I appreciated the freshness of the ingredients, the breadiness overwhelmed me somewhat, so much so that for the first time, I could not finish a slice of Tony's pizza.\n\nJamie liked his $5.25 slice of the Pepperoni, and the slice was frankly enough for two with an abundance of meat (photo: http://bit.ly/1GCBVXt). My one complaint was the amount of grease that accumulated on the cheese probably because it spent some time saturating in the display case. Even with the focus on pizza, there were plenty of other items on the menu - salads, a couple of pasta specialties, paninis and apparently a meatball sub to die for according to the server who was pushing it hard. I have no doubt that Tony will bring 'em in again although I hope he doesn't go into a franchise zone with his award-winning pizzas. Not worried yet, but I'll be back to monitor it.
