I really had to think about how many stars this place deserves..\n\nMy husband's friend who was born and raised in Nicaragua brought us here yesterday for lunch, and up until yesterday, I had never tried Nicaraguan food, so I was super excited. I love trying new food! And what better what to do it than with a friend who knows what it's about!! \nSo we parked, and headed into the restaurant around 1:00pm, and the first thing I noticed was that it was CASH ONLY. I hate cash only, but I guess no biggy, our friend went to the ATM next door. The place was busy, but we were able to sit down immediately, and were given our menus. 45 MINUTES LATER the waitress took our order!! That is no joke! I'm not exaggerating. From the time we sat down, our order was taken 45 minutes after. She never even came over to acknowledge us. Our friend had to call her over twice. The first time he did, she very rudely told him to wait. If it weren't for our friend taking us here and loving this place because it feels like home, I would've said something after 15 minutes, but I let it go. After ordering, it took another 30-45 minutes to get our food. What irritated the hell out of me was that two tables that sat down about 10 minutes after we did got their food about 20 minutes before we did. I hate it when restaurants do that! My 1 year old is fantastic when we go out to eat, but even this was too long for her, she was getting pretty fussy. \nOur friend ordered two plates of the Maria Elena Special, a side of the fried cheese, and 3 cacao drinks and man was the food awesome! I loved it!! He originally wanted to order just one of the Maria Elena Specials and then another, but the waitress told us that they were out of the other one. I didn't hear what he ordered, but I thought it was strange that they were out on a Sunday for lunch (probably their busiest time of the week). You should have popular items prepared.. just saying.. but anywho, the fried cheese was so good!! My husband really liked the asados and plantains, and my daughter loved the gallo pinto. Either that, or she was starving from the wait -___-. The salad also paired really nicely with everything else. I loved everything! The disappointing part... the waitress never brought the side of the fried cheese. Unfortunately, my friend never double-checked it, but I really hope he wasn't charged for it because I felt like he was. The crazy part was when she brought the two plates of the Maria Elena, she said the fried cheese was coming, so I don't know how it got lost there..\n\nWe left a 3:20pm. We were there for lunch over 2 hours!! 2 HOURS!!!!! I'm just glad that we were with good company. Chatting helped distract us from the RIDICULOUS SLOW SERVICE. And to me, the waitress wasn't all that friendly or apologetic about the long wait. I actually thought she was rude. I am so happy our friend took us here, but it sucks how bad the service was. I really wanted to give it a 5 star review because the food here is awesome. So awesome that even after the experience, I think I would come back, but I definitely don't think it deserved it. I actually think I'm being generous with the 3 stars..I think if this place were to do better in serving their customers it would be a HIT!
