Coming out of the Montgomery BART station, reminded me of why Skid Row remained \"Skidded out.\"\n\nCheap Chinese Food, Crackheads screaming out obscenities, and your fashionable Hipster Business Consultant all on the same block, go figure. Back on topic, we finally got here after drifting about, discussing which streets to turn on and such. A notable restaurant on my bookmark list for a good year and a half, I get to see why so many people enjoy and appreciate this small French Get Away in an SF Alleyway!\n\nGoing inside, it is it dim with splash of bright red and an authentication of location (Euni says this place is as legit as French can be in the Bay Area, go figure). After waiting for several minutes, the waitress sat us down and urged us to order in 10 minutes otherwise we wouldn't be able to order brunch (boo, for lack of compromise). I hate being rushed to order stuff, so it made me a bit disappointed. Looking through the options for a good 5 minutes, here's what we decided to order:\n\nDrinks:\n-Waters all around\n-1 glass of ($15.00 for a glass and $60.00 for a bottle) Lalande De Pomerol  Ch\u00e2teau Haute-Goujon, Bordeaux 2002 \n\nDishes:\n\nSandwiches:\n-1 order of Quiche Lorraine; consists of: pate feuillet\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fraiche, bacon, and egg\n\nEntree's:\n-1 order of Paleron De Flanchet ; consists of:\nflank steak, marchand de vin sauce, served with pommes frites\n\n(I couldn't recall the third entree that my friend Zel ordered but it was also delicious)\n\nDesserts:\n\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e; consists of: 'bourbon' vanilla bean\n-1 order of Sorbet du Jour; selection of Ciao Bella sorbet (plum and mango flavors chosen)\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Coconut Cafe Claude's house flan\n\n\nLet's start with the missing entree, although I wasn't able to recall which one it was. The mysterious green dish escaping my memory banks served its purpose by fulfilling my appetite, probably my more preferred dish to order over my Flat Iron Steak any day of the week. Apologies for the lack of detail on that note.\n\nNext, the Quiche' was decent and size and of course filling for my friend Euni. Although just like my mother, she too has an inability to take a lot of rich food within a short period of time. Therefore, I guess unlike her I can continue enjoying the culinary delights the French can offer at a greater magnitude. Then comes my dish the Paleron De Flanchet, was alright. Tender (as it was served medium, but preferably medium-rare per suggestion of the server) but not enough to satisfy my love for steak. The sauce, was good with the pomme frites, and I decided to decline the use of ketchup.\n\nThe wine, my god for $15.00 I considered it a bit of highway robbery initially. If, Euni didn't mention to me that any wine from Bordeaux was worth the price hike I probably would have cried foul. But no, alas it did its job in pacifying my post-economic recession rage. I was smitten and smothered with the smooth rouge hitting my tongue. No spice, no fuss, all nice (another bottle to add to my ever growing wine collection).\n\nLastly the desserts, the sorbet (consisting of plum and mango) that Euni ordered was splendid. Sorbets not being my thing since the invention of \"Push-Pop creamsicles\" made me appreciate tartness. Then came the coconut flan of Zel's, very creamy. I actually wish my mom and other dessert specialists were to re-create this masterpiece for me personally in the future. And of course, my Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e was outstanding (much better than Shin Sen Gumi's in Fountain Valley, Ca. and Bijou's in Hayward). \n\nSo even with all this good food, why such a mediocre rating? Service...I can't stress that enough. Like Somerset, I felt our table was a bit overshadowed, although our waitress apologized the delay in our receipt and change after paying for the meal ($85.00 altogether with tax and tip). I can't believe their detail in service is lacking. Maybe it's because we came in at a time when they were transitioning shifts from Brunch to Dinner...I'm willing to give them that. But until, I come back for a dinner experience my rating still stands.\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoy what you brought in terms of French cuisine as far as my experience is concern.

This little slice of awesome has been sitting in my bookmarks for who knows how long.  \"I'll get to typing out your review one day\" I would promise but the day never seemed to come.  Well lunch today reminded me of why I love the Cafe Claude experience and moved me to finally express my feelings for all to see.\n\nI really had no idea where I was going to eat today so I started my usual stroll by places familiar in search of the right spot to fill my belly.  However, I did not want my belly too full.  So as I was walking along I started to think to myself, \"where can you get something that has amazing flavor in a relatively small package?\"  Being that I was now walking along Kearny it hit me...CAFE CLAUDE!!!\n\nSo I walk up to the little alleyway in which the cafe is located and was greeted with their signboard listing today's specials.  I was actually a little heartbroken when I saw that I was going to have to chose between two items that I knew would be wonderful, either the pasta bolognaise or the pan seared scallops with mashed potatoes and a hollandaise sauce.  I knew no matter which one I picked I would have my mind on the other one, wondering if I made the right choice.\n\nLucky for me, there was no wrong choice.  My waiter, whose name I unfortunately did not memorize, recommended the pan seared scallops.  Not because it was better than the bolognaise, but because I had let him know that I was hoping to eat something a little less filling.  He also suggested that I have the endive salad, which was delicious and a great preparation for the scallops.\n\nThe pan seared scallops, the hollandaise sauce, the mashed potatoes...what can I say about something so close to perfection?  My goodness when I took that first bite of the scallops I was so happy.  You couldn't possibly sear them any better.  They had a nice slightly firm texture and the flavor mixed beautifully with the hollandaise sauce.  I thought that I would pass on the mashed potatoes since I didn't want to leave with a heavy stomach but they were whipped wonderfully.  They weren't runny or too dense.\n\nI'm usually obsessive about brushing my teeth after lunch but today I want to savor the flavor in my mouth.  I don't care if I run into one beautiful lady after another, I'm not trading my cafe claude flavor for kissable breath anytime soon.  I will most definitely be back soon to hopefully have another chance at the bolognaise, which I am sure will be just as tasty.\n\nAside from today's lunch Cafe Claude has some tasty sandwiches.  The most memorable was a crab sandwich I had the first time I stopped by Cafe Claude for lunch.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the sandwiches on the menu.  Items that I have had my eye on but have yet to try are the soupe a l'oignon, quiche lorraine, and the gratin dauphinois.\n\nThe staff here is pleasant to outstanding.

(Lunch)\nFrench 75 - This has got to be the tastiest champagne cocktail ever!  I forget exactly whats in this but I believe its rosee with grapefruit and lime juices - packs a nice punch and fizz, especially for an afternoon lunch or brunch.  I really liked this one, plus it looks pretty!\n\nCheese Plate w/ Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry, pica portuguese, Runchon - This was such a GOOD deal.  Cheese plate was only $16 and had huge slices of fabulous cheese.  The Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry was soft, creamy and absolutely, RIDICULOUSLY yummy with a hint of sweetness on the tongue; Pica was very creamy and had a brie-like texture with a nice milky smell, and the Runchon was fabulous with the dates and honey supplied on the plate.  \n\nCroque Madame w/ Pommes Frites & Salad - HOOOOOMG.  The Croque Madame PWNS any sammich out there. Straight up... PWNS.  Crisp toasted bread with ham, and grueyre cheese melted with a lovely sunnyside egg on top?  What the F*XOrz.  It was so good.  The pommes frites were thin and crispy but the insides were not soggy and the dipping sauce was just right! This plate even had an accompanying salad, that was drizzled with olive oil (I presume). PERFECT. \n \nQuiche Lorraine - only having a bite of this. I'd have to say it was pretty damn good. But i really did prefer my Croque Madame much better :D\n\n-----------------------------\nPigging out - Second Round - GO! (Dinner)\n\nLe Petit Ecolier - Tasty little bugger, but not much alcohol in it.  I would suggest something else if you're interested in a *real* cocktail. \n\nPommes Frites - Very good, same rating as above in the Lunch portion of the review.\n\nEscargot - Okay, snails - probably not exactly the food you'd eat everyday, but hello, if I can eat cow tongue and not flinch then I think I can handle some wimpy little snails.  F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!!!!  Kinda expensive for $10 for 5 little snails, but damn were they good.  Baked in some sort of special crockery with five little holes topped with round disks of baked bread or some sort of flaky pastry all broiled under a tasty oily concotion.  It was like SUPER MINI SNAIL POT PIE.  YUM.  YUM!!!\n \nFlank Steak - Very very well done \"medium rare\" steak.  Cooked on the outer edges with a good rare on the inside, this steak was yummy though I wish I would have had the Coq au Vin for my main dish. \n\nCoq au Vin - What praise I have for this dish.  Fabulous, hearty, rich and absolutely satisfying any time or place.  Soft, falling off the bone chicken with pearl onions, bacon and a wonderful wine sauce.  Not too salty, not too bland, just perfect!  Loved this; I had to stop myself from stealing it all from a hungry bear! \n\n------------\n\nResult: Me= KO and Cafe Claude = WINS AGAIN!\n\n\nReally though, a fabulous bistro with great atmosphere and better than average service.

Our server's mixing station was out of my line of vision, so I couldn't really see what was going on. The end result revealed a smooth and creamy steak tartare. The accompanying ingredients were easy to pick out and had a mild tartness, but weren't too strong and didn't overpower the steak. The thin, buttery slices of baked baguette were thin, crunchy vessels for the tartare.\n\n$28 Steak Frites - bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise sauce, pommes frites:\nThe flank steak was a small portion, but it was still pretty juicy for a lean cut of beef, especially with the bordelaise sauce. The bone marrow butter, surprisingly, was green. Mr. Joy, the fry connoisseur, also said the frites were very good - crispy and seasoned well with herbs.\n\n$24 Coq au Vin - mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrot, red wine sauce:\nClaude makes coq au vin just how I like it. It was served in a cast-iron dish, which helped keep it warm throughout the meal. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Next to the chicken, the cipollini onions are my favorite part. They just taste taste so sweet and juicy. Their red wine sauce, surprisingly, was rather light in color. It still had the savory, tart, and buttery notes of a red wine sauce though. The consistency is not very thick, but I prefer the sauce to be not too heavy. Like some coq au vin dishes that I've tried in France, it tastes like chicken sitting in a rich broth as opposed to a thick sauce. The only thing minor thing I would have changed was they could have cut the carrots smaller so it would have been easier to eat.\n\nWe left with satisfied taste buds and full bellies after realizing we had consumed a nearly all meat meal. Well, as true carnivores, it wasn't all that surprising. Service was as delightful as the food. Our server was very sweet & friendly, and spoke with an enviable French accent.

Knowing of the French places near the French Consulte, I focussed there. I'm a former resident of France and appreciate the food tremendously.\n\nUnfortunately, there were so many negative reviews of so many of the places, including Cafe Claude, I just set it aside in desperation, figuring we'd just walk around and pick a place based on a pretty full restaurant (actual attendance speaks louder than reviews). Coincidentally, my wife's hairdresser just a block away highly recommended Claude, so we went.\n\nSuperb. Except for them serving bread and butter (unsalted--so I have zero idea of what all the \"too salty\" reviews are talking about) before the meal for American expectations, it was totally authentic. To wit:\n\n1. The veal sweetbreads were divine. I saw a veganesque review that actually complained about the name. Uh, how do you respond to that kind of utter ignorance? They were succulent, essentially natural meatballs in a preparation that allowed them to stand largely on their own.\n\n2. The Steak Tartare was precisely French. Hand chopped steak like I do at home (it's not hamburger folks) and even in the \"spicy\" configuration I asked for, it's French spicy, which means more of the provincial herbs and spices, not hot, not salty, not peppery.\n\n3. They know how to serve a whiskey: ice cubes on the side.\n\n4. The Onion soup was actually FRENCH onion soup and not AMERICAN onion soup so many of the ignorant, negative reviews complain about. See, French onion soup is not served such that it burns your mouth (French serve all food not extremely hot nor cold--except ice cream--because you get more flavor when food is in a smaller range from room temp, warm or cool). Nor is FRENCH onion soup thickened with corn or potato starch to make it \"hearty.\" It's a near demi-glace beef broth made from roasting bones & marrow, boiling them for a long time, letting the broth reduce and concentrate flavor, then introducing onions. Many French really don't even eat the croutons or much of the cheese, because it's never a meal. It's all about the oniony flavor of a light beefy broth.\n\n5. They had a lamb shank special and it was perfect. So Frenchy.\n\nIn all, a perfect meal where I left invigorated, massaged with flavor, pampered with good service and made the drive back to San Jose without the slightest hint of comatose remorse after so many American styled meals of excess.\n\nGood job.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-06-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The escargot, french fries, and the steak tartare were also amazing, as was the french onion soup, which was so NOT salty (I secretly wanted to add more salt and so did my friend).  \n\n"], "author": "Rachelle P.", "review": "Oh my, was I happy with Cafe Claude.  \n\nAfter reading a good amount of Yelp! reviews, I was worried that my friends and I had made our dinner reservation at the wrong place - overly salty soup, bland coq au vin, cramped quarters - so NOT true!   \n\nThe duck confit and the trout were phenomenal - and I'm not pulling your legs here - phenom.

"], "author": "Matt S.", "review": "I've been to Cafe Claude two times in the past 4-6 months and have experienced extreme inadequacies in both food and service. Let me get right into it.\n\n1) One one occasion I ordered the Coq Au Vin. Everything about it was pretty delicious but, about half way through, I realized that there were no fingerling potatoes in the dish. So, I asked the waitress - \"Does the coq au vin come with fingerling potatoes?\" The reply - \"Yes! Does yours not have any?\" Me: \"No, no fingerling potatoes found.\" Her: \"Oh I'm so sorry about that!\" Then she walks away. I was expecting to receive some potatoes after that. Nope. Nothing and no further acknowledgement. Weird. \n\n2) We stood at the bar once while waiting for our party to arrive. I ordered a Manhattan. A couple sips in, I realize there are two floating gnats/flies in my drink. I discreetly let the bartender know. He quickly takes the drink away and five minutes later produces another Manhattan. He does not say \"Sorry\" at least once. No \"Terribly sorry about that! Your drink will be free of charge.\" There are a lot of people I know out there that would FREAK OUT after this - he was lucky I don't take much mind to such things. \n\n3) On another occasion I ordered the Faux Fillet. I ordered it Medium Rare and it came to me Medium Well. The steak was chewy and lacked flavor. The only thing good about the dish were the fries. \n\n4) Ordered the Steak Tartare - it was so heavy with mustard that I couldn't taste anything else. Good thing I was hungry and didn't mind so much. \n\n5) Service. Just some general thoughts here. It's not really a big deal, but it seems like a lot of the service people accidentally step on each others toes. Bussers will take some plates, the waiter a few, some people get waters, some don't. One person brings the bottled water, while another brings something else. It just seems a little amateur at times. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, there are definitely some great things about Cafe Claude, but they don't really make up for all the bad that has occurred. But, I'll mention them anyway!\n\nGood stuff - the live music is great. It's always very entertaining, but not too loud as to make it so ALL you're doing is listening to the music. It's still very easy to have a conversation. It's subtle, yet present. Despite my bad experience with the cocktail above, I really do think they mix up a great cocktail. I also really like their glassware. If anything, maybe Cafe Claude is a great place for a cocktail and a couple appetizers, or maybe a cocktail and desert.

Perfect 'Mr. Big' situation.\n\nCafe Claude is a gem tucked in an alley near Union Square. I had meant to go there in a long time, and I picked the right occasion to give it a try - what a captivating place!\n\nThe restaurant is relatively small, with a nice patio area. The interior looked more appealing to me, with its dimmed lighting, jazz band playing and sensual decor. We sat at the very back of the restaurant, where we could still enjoy the music, but at the same time carry a good conversation comfortably. Yes, that was the most important thing as we had a lot to catch up on.\n\nI ordered a glass of Sancerre, a French white that went really well with the special: seafood risotto. What an entrancing experience! Maybe it was the fact that I had the worst seafood risotto in my life a week before (see previous review), or maybe it was the ambiance or circumstance. But all I can say is 'wow'! The perfect texture, the perfect flavors, fabulous presentation!\n\nBig ordered the Truit Aux Amandes (pan-seared trout, almonds, white mushroom lemon sauce, fingerling potatoes, romano beans). His dish was also delish, and although he was a little hesitant about going to a French restaurant, he was really happy with my suggestion. ;-) \n\nThe service was attentive, and I really appreciated that they gave us time to just enjoy our meal and conversation without interruptions. That was definitely a plus.\n\nIt was one of those  nice warm week nights in SF, and the situation didn't allow me to focus 100% on the restaurant experience as I would like to.

The ambiance was very warm and intimate, and live jazzy music started about halfway through our meal.\nWe shared the escargots to start. The snails were deliciously drowning in garlic-parsley butter, with little \"croute\" hats on top. I wish there had been more than six - very tasty!\nIt took us a while to figure out what entrees to order as both colleagues are limited eaters at the moment (one is gluten-free) and the server was a little fussy about substitutions.

The seared-to-medium fillet was perched atop French lentils with bacon, and dressed with a tangy horseradish cream. The dish was rich enough to stand up to the bottle of Cotes du Rhone that we shared.\nI stole a few bites of the white bean and artichoke ragout from the lamb plate, but was unimpressed. My favorite entree turned out to be my friend's trout aux amandes - perfectly cooked trout was slathered in lightly toasted almonds and a white wine lemon sauce (that inexplicably contained mushrooms?). The green beans were somewhat uninspired but the butter-drenched fingerling potatoes were very good, as butter-drenched items tend to be. \nI also had a bite of the moelleux au chocolat, which was soft and chocolaty good.\n\nThe special was described as a blue-nose sea bass and it sounded really good, but it was 29 bucks!

"], "author": "Vivienne K.", "review": "Cafe Claude, you are a French Cloude floating amid the SF financial district.  A little piece of Paris for the hefty price of San Francisco - a little food staycation for those that want more than food... like jam (no, not the fruity jar-ed kind - the melodic kind). I like that this restaurant integrates a musical live jazz experience with the romantic French prose of food - the escargot; the wine; the French onion soup; the chocolate soft cake.  It is an experience for the taste buds - and for the ear buds over a most memorable experience with your best buds (the human ones).  \n\nIt is nice that the people running the restaurant are  from France, and are very helpful and kind in making recommendations and providing decent service (though it could have been a bit more efficient). \n\nWhat dishes did I enjoy?\n\n(1) The escargots en croute.  I liked the buttery, garlic and parsley infused reduction with shallots and anchovy - and how the escargot were baked in like delicate swirled angels sleeping in a puff pastry blanket.  \n\n(2) My favorite dish was the french onion soup (soup a l'oignon). And is the oignON spot ON. My only constructive criticism about this dish is that I wish it were less salty. However, the onion soup gratinee had a most beautiful red wine aftertaste that married well with the melting emMENTAL cheese that is a mental wonderland. The baguette crouton was sliced in the perfect thickness to create a golden ratio of onion soup. \n\n(3) Actually - I take that back. My actual favorite dish was the dessert. The Moelleux au Chocolat was in fact my favorite dish here.  The soft chocolate cake was not too sweet - which I appreciated as the bitterness of the chocolate was able to come through to surface in its natural roughness. The Creme Anglaise vanilla sauce was poured in, melding in with the chocolate to form a chocolate-creme anglaise combination that was black and white harmony at its most intimate peak. \n\nWhat dishes could have used perhaps a little more thoughtfulness?\n\n(A) The Casserole de Champignon. The ingredients were great - the farro verde, the king trumpet mushrooms, the carrots, the broccolini and kale.  I just wish there were more flavor other than butter. And I wish that there was more to it. I am a person who appreciates simplicity when it comes to good food - but there is simplicity done thoughtfully and tastefully and simplicity done in the other direction. I am afraid this fell in the latter category. \n\n(B) Confit de Canard. The duck was crisp, but it came at the expense of moisture, for I have never eaten such a dry piece of duck in my life. I was also a bit disappointed at the portion size. I did appreciate the warm puy lentils and the fris\u00e9e; and I enjoyed the flavor of course mustard against the duck.  \n\nCafe Claude, I applaude that you share a little piece of France - and beautiful live music with it - in the oft busy SF life.

She's so fabulous! \nMy only gripe with the pate is that I wish they gave us more crostinis. 3 girls, 3 pates, and only like pieces?

But I've tried others' dishes and I can honestly say that pretty much anything you get here excels in both quality and quantity, so you're bound to find something to suit your needs or preferences. Most importantly, it's consistently fulfilling... as French cuisine, fortunately, tends to be.\n\nThe ambiance really does it for me though... As a Barcelonian, I often miss that quintessentially European atmosphere and they've really managed to capture that essence at Cafe Claude, from the decor to the lighting, so that's a lovely touch. Jazz evenings are delightful, unless you're trying to have an intense conversation, so that's something to keep in mind, but I personally enjoy it every time. The customer service is reliably good, ranging from polite to warm, depending on the person, but I've never had any complaints. While I've experienced and sincerely enjoyed eating outside on their alleyway tables, I love the atmosphere inside and typically prefer to stay in the warmth of their dining rooms... but both are excellent options, weather permitting. Ultimately, Cafe Claude works for every occasion, but is always uniquely charming, which is quite the accomplishment and, in my books, completely deserving of 5 stars... so with all my heart and stomach: merci, Cafe Claude!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-07-31"}], "brandade de morue": [], "foie gras au torchon": [{"excerpts": ["We started the meal with the Foie Gras Au Torchon and it was delicious!

We just so happened were planning to catch up since he was in town (and nothing more than that if you were thinking so... haha) and a lot of the places we considered were closing because we had to go after I got off work and so we were thinking of a great place around the downtown area.  We both agreed that we would LOVE to find that French restaurant we went to for lunch back when we were dating and since I remembered what street it was on but not the name, I simply googled \"french restaurant by bush street\" and this place came up on top.  I was 100% it was the place because the name sounded so familiar so we gave it a try! Didn't take long to find parking (thank goodness) and we saw the nostalgic ally way it hides in and we were SO happy! They weren't too busy either so we were able to get seats pretty fast.  You would not believe how nostalgic that place was to us.

It tasted so similar to the one I had in France at Le Zeyer but they added fromage on top which I thought was such an interesting touch, which made it all the more amazing! I believe I ordered the Confit De Canard that night and my date had the Coq Au Vin.  I seriously loved that duck.

I'm in SF for a week and I fully expected to fall in love and eat there every day for the rest of my visit. Unfortunately, I was disappointed from the moment I walked in the door.\n\nI arrived at 1:35 for a 1:45 lunch reservation. The hostess met me at the door and the first thing out of her mouth was \"Do you have a reservation?\" (Note: it was obviously the end of lunch time with several open tables inside the small dining room and the remaining diners clearly reaching the end of their meals). When I told her I had a 1:45 reservation she pointed out that I was 10 minutes early and they had not turned over my table yet. She asked if I wanted to sit outside instead, which I did not. She directed me to wait at the bar and handed me a cocktail menu and wine list to peruse while I waited.\n\nAfter maybe five minutes the hostess informed me my table was ready and brought me to the worst table in the dining room - a two top at the end of the banquette with a large column on one side. It was such a tight corner that the chair for a second diner was at a 90 degree angle to the banquette instead of across from it and about 25% of the table was actually pushed up to/in front of the corner column. I squeezed my way between the tables to sit on the banquette where I basically had no room to use my left arm and sat with my left hand in my lap the whole time. There was a four top table next to me with two older ladies at it and on the other side of them were two open tables.\n\nAfter a couple more minutes my server came over and just said \"We have a soup of the day, it's beef and vegetable.\" and then just looked at me. I asked for sparkling water with lime. She may have given a quick nod and then walked away.\n\nSeveral minutes later (and with no water) the server returned and literally said \"Are you ready to go?\" I asked about my water and she explained that she has to wait for the bartender to get the bottle for her. There had been no one at the bar since before I entered the restaurant, so I'm not sure what the hold up was. I ordered the salade maison to start and the steak frites medium rare with a side of aioli.\n\nA few minutes later the hostess who originally sat me came over with my bottle of sparking water and a glass - but no lime. A couple minutes after that my salad arrived.\n\nThe salad was very good - the champagne vinaigrette was just right and the lettuce was fresh - and I really enjoyed it. When I was finished my server cleared my plate and left a steak knife but left my fork (I kind of expected a clean fork for each course).\n\nSteak frites showed up and, no surprise, no side of aioli. After a couple of minutes my server noticed I had received my food and remembered I had asked for aioli, which she then brought over. It was orange, so I asked what it was seasoned with and she told me it was harissa. Seems a little odd for a French place and I really didn't care for the flavor with the frites, but my only other options were ketchup or spicy mustard. The steak and marrow butter were very good and cooked perfectly, but I seem to have been missing the port-shallot sauce.\n\nAdditionally, there did not appear to be any bread offered during lunch. If a place is going to advertise themselves as \"A virtual European vacation tucked in the heart of San Francisco's financial district near Union Square, this charming French restaurant provides a Paris fix via \"tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licieux\" cuisine, exquisite service and lovely Left Bank atmosphere.\" I kind of expect to have some baguette and butter.\n\nTo summarize, the food was quite good but the service I received was a huge let-down and I will not be going back.

Anyway, I came back for lunch with a couple of colleagues, and it was quite nice and not at all crowded. Pardonnez-moi, Claude.\n\nEven though Gaspar Brasserie is more elaborate, Cafe Claude is still the most authentic feeling French bistro in the FiDi although both are owned by Franck LeClerc. Strolling on Claude Lane may stir memories of the back alleys of Montmartre in Paris. As if I knew. However, I've seen a Truffaut film and an episode of Rick Steves' Paris series, so that must make me a Francophile par excellence. The menu is classic bistro fare with no exceptions. We first started off with the $14 Salade D'\u00e9t\u00e9, a lovely melange of heirloom tomatoes and lemon cucumbers with herb oil, tomato coulis, and crispy shallots (photo: http://bit.ly/1KiPgqg). Yes, that was indeed an idyllic taste of summer. One of my colleagues went for the Salade Ni\u00e7oise, which was presented in classic fashion.\n\nUnlike the perfunctory presentation I received at the Honey Bistro, the tuna confit was piled high on the lettuce, along with the haricots verts, olives, potatoes, capers and anchovies with the hard-boiled eggs decoratively placed on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1LBoVkz). My $20 Moules Frites came next, and the pile of mussels were flavored pungently with a garlic confit, shallots, white wine, dijon, and saffron (photo: http://bit.ly/1NFcaZu). My one minor complaint was that there could have been a few more, even for lunch, but the pomme frites were perfectly crisped and seasoned and placed in a rumpled faux-newspaper (photo: http://bit.ly/1i947aj), the same as the sliced crusty baguette (photo: http://bit.ly/1Eov7N2). I should probably wear a beret and smoke those little French cigarettes next time I come.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...classic bistro fare doesn't disappoint\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...closest I'll get to Paris for a while\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...mostly attentive, they should speak with Maurice Chevalier accents\nTOTAL - 4 stars...wish I had not waited so long to return as it is still a jewel", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Her dish is a complete roasted half chicken paired up with seasonal greens, Ni\u00e7oise olives (which were omitted from her dish by request), rosemary, and lemon. "], "author": "Donovan H.", "review": "When visiting San Francisco, it can be a real challenge finding an ideal French restaurant that blends romantic, intimate, and classy. With that said and done, \"Cafe Claude\" offers everything you're looking for in a cozy and ambient atmosphere. And surprisingly, for a city that has an endless list of award-winning restaurants, finding somewhere to dine was trickier than I had anticipated.\n\nLocated directly in the heart of the Financial District and only a few blocks from Union Square, \"Cafe Claude\" is actually tucked on an alley way. Parking in this part of town can be very scarce any day of the week so its best to use public transportation or take a cab. However, on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm, I was able to score a parking spot less than 2 blocks away which doesn't happen very often in downtown San Francisco.\n\nI come here with my fianc\u00e9e, Claudia as I had already made reservations (via-Open Table) prior to arrival. As expected, the restaurant was bustling with hungry customers inside and out. And when I say out, there is a large area where people are seated outside; I'd have to say that I am not entirely thrilled by it as it takes away a lot of the charm of the restaurant. Fortunately, we were seated inside and placed directly in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe overall interior is as French and European as you can get.  Everything from the decor to the French artwork placed on the walls, this place truly feels as if you're dining in Paris. Keep in mind that the inside is relatively small so don't be discouraged if you happen to eavesdrop in your neighbors conversations. One thing that had me sold on dining here is that \"Cafe Claude\" offers live jazz music Wednesday through Sunday. This was one of the major reasons what inspired me to dine here as French cuisine and jazz music go hand in hand.\n\nAs we were seated, our waitress explains some of the specialties of what they're offering. Now I don't like to criticize but her French accent was a bit hard at times to understand but fortunately I was able to pick up most of the words. We brought a bottle of our red wine where they will charge a $20.00 corkage fee. As an appetizer, we decided on splitting their \"Ch\u00e8vre\" (for $14.00). This was a salad that consisted of baby lettuce, warm goat cheese, toasted levain, apples, candied walnuts, and drizzled with cider vinegar. Our salad comes out within 5 minutes and is complemented with a French baguette.\n\nAs far as our main entrees, I decide on ordering the \"Coq Au Vin\" (for $24.00). This meal is a free-range chicken that includes bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrots, and red wine sauce. My fianc\u00e9e decided on the \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" (for $23.00). Her dish is a complete roasted half chicken paired up with seasonal greens, Ni\u00e7oise olives (which were omitted from her dish by request), rosemary, and lemon. Both of our dishes arrived within 20 minutes.\n\nAt first glance, the servings that are offered at \"Cafe Claude\" are very generous. You definitely get your moneys worth as the entire presentation was simple yet effective. I was pleasantly surprised with the how tasty my \"Coq Au Vin\" was. The red wine sauce had a zesty flavor that complimented well with the tender pieces of chicken. It also had a unique homemade taste that is not found at a classy French restaurant and something that I would enjoy at my mom's house. I also tried some of my fianc\u00e9es \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" as this was extremely tasty. The chicken was very moist as it had the perfect amount of lemon and rosemary that balanced out the dish very well.\n\nSince we still had a little room left for dessert, we decided on going the safe route in ordering their \"Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" and 2 glasses of champagne to go with it. That hit the spot as it had the perfect amount of crust on top with the creamy filling underneath. Overall, if you're looking for an above average French restaurant in San Francisco, \"Cafe Claude\" is a restaurant worth checking out. Was it the best I've had? No, but it was very good and you won't be disappointed.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-10-19"}, {"excerpts": ["She got the tuna ni\u00e7oise and wasn't as impressed - not that it was necessarily bad, but the tuna was quite salty.

I felt like sitting down and having a nice experience while eating and I did not want to go to the usual Belden Ct places.... so, I said... Cafe Claude!  The location is a bit hidden, which I like because it seems like you are going to a secret spot... although, it is good... and as such it is hard to keep it a secret.  As you walk up to the alley it is located in... you all of the sudden feel like you are transported to a land far away... well... as long as you don't sit outside looking towards Bush street.

A little piece of Paris for the hefty price of San Francisco - a little food staycation for those that want more than food... like jam (no, not the fruity jar-ed kind - the melodic kind). I like that this restaurant integrates a musical live jazz experience with the romantic French prose of food - the escargot; the wine; the French onion soup; the chocolate soft cake.  It is an experience for the taste buds - and for the ear buds over a most memorable experience with your best buds (the human ones).  \n\nIt is nice that the people running the restaurant are  from France, and are very helpful and kind in making recommendations and providing decent service (though it could have been a bit more efficient). \n\nWhat dishes did I enjoy?\n\n(1) The escargots en croute.  I liked the buttery, garlic and parsley infused reduction with shallots and anchovy - and how the escargot were baked in like delicate swirled angels sleeping in a puff pastry blanket.  \n\n(2) My favorite dish was the french onion soup (soup a l'oignon). And is the oignON spot ON. My only constructive criticism about this dish is that I wish it were less salty. However, the onion soup gratinee had a most beautiful red wine aftertaste that married well with the melting emMENTAL cheese that is a mental wonderland. The baguette crouton was sliced in the perfect thickness to create a golden ratio of onion soup. \n\n(3) Actually - I take that back. My actual favorite dish was the dessert. The Moelleux au Chocolat was in fact my favorite dish here.  The soft chocolate cake was not too sweet - which I appreciated as the bitterness of the chocolate was able to come through to surface in its natural roughness. The Creme Anglaise vanilla sauce was poured in, melding in with the chocolate to form a chocolate-creme anglaise combination that was black and white harmony at its most intimate peak. \n\nWhat dishes could have used perhaps a little more thoughtfulness?\n\n(A) The Casserole de Champignon. The ingredients were great - the farro verde, the king trumpet mushrooms, the carrots, the broccolini and kale.  I just wish there were more flavor other than butter. And I wish that there was more to it. I am a person who appreciates simplicity when it comes to good food - but there is simplicity done thoughtfully and tastefully and simplicity done in the other direction. I am afraid this fell in the latter category. \n\n(B) Confit de Canard. The duck was crisp, but it came at the expense of moisture, for I have never eaten such a dry piece of duck in my life. I was also a bit disappointed at the portion size. I did appreciate the warm puy lentils and the fris\u00e9e; and I enjoyed the flavor of course mustard against the duck.  \n\nCafe Claude, I applaude that you share a little piece of France - and beautiful live music with it - in the oft busy SF life.

This was the same alley that housed dumpsters full of restaurant waste all day and down which I'd seen rats routinely darting.  Cafe Claude opened on another alley, Claude Lane, and I felt similarly though I'll admit to enjoying a post-work drink there now and then.  \n\nIt'd been years since my last visit but on this evening I walked here from the new MOMA with friends in tow who knew not where we were headed.  What still looked like sort of an abysmally dark alley was seen through their fresh eyes as we ventured down the lane.  Then, stepping into Cafe Claude we were greeted in a way that helped overcome any reticence I might have been wrestling with.  \n\nAll eyes in my party lit with joy when we entered to a trio of jazz musicians (sultry femme singer included) in Cafe Claude's entry.  It seemed as though we'd stumbled into a very well-known (to others) secret and it felt both romantic and very special.  Remember this place if those are the feelings you're going for.  \n\nNo one was sitting outside and it still looked less than appealing to me.  Indoors, however, was packed.  Two tight rooms full of diners enjoying French bistro fare and wine with musical accompaniment.  Ooh la la, tres chic.    \n\nDespite what was an overly long wait between first course and entree (and for which no explanation was given), the food and service here were good, enhanced by the ambiance.  I enjoyed traditional Soupe A L'Oignon ($11) and a Salade with Lardons.  The Steak Frites ($28) wasn't best in class but it was still good and worked well in this environment.  Others at my table had Trout Amandine ($25) and Coq Au Vin ($24) and registered satisfaction.    \n\nDespite falling off my radar the fact that Cafe Claude is still packing them into the FiDi on a weekend night says something for the appeal of their offering.  Be certain to visit on a night with live jazz (Thursday - Saturday, 7 - 10 p.m.) as it'll smooth over any minor flaws and deliver what I'll now call a perfect ambiance.  \n\nIn a dark San Francisco alley.  Who knew?\n\n*  Other stuff:  $1 oysters and $6 cocktails + bites (poutine anyone?) available during HH.

I hadn't heard of hard cider being used to cook mussels, but it turned out magical.

The interior is pretty small, but the booth seating makes it more comfy and cozy. It seems like most of the seating is made up of the covered seating out front. Dining outdoors in Claude Lane is almost a nod to the sidewalk cafes in France, while the dim lighting inside is a more intimate setting. On weekends, there is live music that lightly emanates in the background. Even better, they sometimes have 1000-pt.

Anyway...\n\nWe started with fresh bread wrapped in newsprint with butter filled to the brim of a ramekin. So many delicious things on the menu. Between the mussels, duck confit, & coq au vin, I had a hard time choosing.\n\n$14 Steak Tartare - hand chopped raw flank steak, quail egg, mustard, cornichons, capers, shallots, parsley, croutons:\nThe tartare was prepared tableside, but the tables were too close together. Our server's mixing station was out of my line of vision, so I couldn't really see what was going on. The end result revealed a smooth and creamy steak tartare. The accompanying ingredients were easy to pick out and had a mild tartness, but weren't too strong and didn't overpower the steak. The thin, buttery slices of baked baguette were thin, crunchy vessels for the tartare.\n\n$28 Steak Frites - bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise sauce, pommes frites:\nThe flank steak was a small portion, but it was still pretty juicy for a lean cut of beef, especially with the bordelaise sauce. The bone marrow butter, surprisingly, was green. Mr. Joy, the fry connoisseur, also said the frites were very good - crispy and seasoned well with herbs.\n\n$24 Coq au Vin - mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrot, red wine sauce:\nClaude makes coq au vin just how I like it. It was served in a cast-iron dish, which helped keep it warm throughout the meal. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Next to the chicken, the cipollini onions are my favorite part. They just taste taste so sweet and juicy. Their red wine sauce, surprisingly, was rather light in color. It still had the savory, tart, and buttery notes of a red wine sauce though. The consistency is not very thick, but I prefer the sauce to be not too heavy. Like some coq au vin dishes that I've tried in France, it tastes like chicken sitting in a rich broth as opposed to a thick sauce. The only thing minor thing I would have changed was they could have cut the carrots smaller so it would have been easier to eat.\n\nWe left with satisfied taste buds and full bellies after realizing we had consumed a nearly all meat meal. Well, as true carnivores, it wasn't all that surprising. Service was as delightful as the food. Our server was very sweet & friendly, and spoke with an enviable French accent.

With that said and done, \"Cafe Claude\" offers everything you're looking for in a cozy and ambient atmosphere. And surprisingly, for a city that has an endless list of award-winning restaurants, finding somewhere to dine was trickier than I had anticipated.\n\nLocated directly in the heart of the Financial District and only a few blocks from Union Square, \"Cafe Claude\" is actually tucked on an alley way. Parking in this part of town can be very scarce any day of the week so its best to use public transportation or take a cab. However, on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm, I was able to score a parking spot less than 2 blocks away which doesn't happen very often in downtown San Francisco.\n\nI come here with my fianc\u00e9e, Claudia as I had already made reservations (via-Open Table) prior to arrival. As expected, the restaurant was bustling with hungry customers inside and out. And when I say out, there is a large area where people are seated outside; I'd have to say that I am not entirely thrilled by it as it takes away a lot of the charm of the restaurant. Fortunately, we were seated inside and placed directly in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe overall interior is as French and European as you can get.  Everything from the decor to the French artwork placed on the walls, this place truly feels as if you're dining in Paris. Keep in mind that the inside is relatively small so don't be discouraged if you happen to eavesdrop in your neighbors conversations. One thing that had me sold on dining here is that \"Cafe Claude\" offers live jazz music Wednesday through Sunday. This was one of the major reasons what inspired me to dine here as French cuisine and jazz music go hand in hand.\n\nAs we were seated, our waitress explains some of the specialties of what they're offering. Now I don't like to criticize but her French accent was a bit hard at times to understand but fortunately I was able to pick up most of the words. We brought a bottle of our red wine where they will charge a $20.00 corkage fee. As an appetizer, we decided on splitting their \"Ch\u00e8vre\" (for $14.00). This was a salad that consisted of baby lettuce, warm goat cheese, toasted levain, apples, candied walnuts, and drizzled with cider vinegar. Our salad comes out within 5 minutes and is complemented with a French baguette.\n\nAs far as our main entrees, I decide on ordering the \"Coq Au Vin\" (for $24.00). This meal is a free-range chicken that includes bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrots, and red wine sauce. My fianc\u00e9e decided on the \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" (for $23.00). Her dish is a complete roasted half chicken paired up with seasonal greens, Ni\u00e7oise olives (which were omitted from her dish by request), rosemary, and lemon. Both of our dishes arrived within 20 minutes.\n\nAt first glance, the servings that are offered at \"Cafe Claude\" are very generous. You definitely get your moneys worth as the entire presentation was simple yet effective. I was pleasantly surprised with the how tasty my \"Coq Au Vin\" was. The red wine sauce had a zesty flavor that complimented well with the tender pieces of chicken. It also had a unique homemade taste that is not found at a classy French restaurant and something that I would enjoy at my mom's house. I also tried some of my fianc\u00e9es \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" as this was extremely tasty. The chicken was very moist as it had the perfect amount of lemon and rosemary that balanced out the dish very well.\n\nSince we still had a little room left for dessert, we decided on going the safe route in ordering their \"Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" and 2 glasses of champagne to go with it. That hit the spot as it had the perfect amount of crust on top with the creamy filling underneath. Overall, if you're looking for an above average French restaurant in San Francisco, \"Cafe Claude\" is a restaurant worth checking out. Was it the best I've had? No, but it was very good and you won't be disappointed.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-10-19"}, {"excerpts": ["My coq au vin was tender and flavorful and my friend's steak frites was cooked to perfection. \n\n"], "author": "Suzanne D.", "review": "We dined her last night and were pleased to find that Caf\u00e9 Claude still serves an excellent dinner.

VERY DISAPPOINTED.\n\nWith the new addition of a 2nd dining area at Cafe Claude, all the asian couples were seated in this newly added area. If you were asian, you were seated in this part of the restaurant. Even if only part of the couple was asian, they were still seated in this area. The girlfriend and I thought this was weird. I personally thought that this was very, VERY uncool. Being as this is the bay area and San Francisco especially. I'm still shaking my head at this establishment. To ensure that was possibly an accident, the girlfriend and I decided to leave through the back of the of this dining area so that we would walk through the other part of the restaurant; and to my disappointment, there was not one asian person seated in the main dining area at Cafe Claude. This is FUCKED UP!\n\nNow on to the dining experience.\n\nAs I made reservations 2 days prior, and arriving 15mins late (thanks bay bridge traffic) we were seated right away in the new dining area. When we checked in at the main part of Cafe Claude, only 25% of the tables in the main dining area were filled, so as to why the hostess chose to seat us in the secondary dining area, I have no fucking idea why.\n\nOur server was cordial, polite, and informative. She was professional and a terrific reflection upon the establishment. The wait for our food was the exact opposite. We and the tables around us waited about 45-55 minutes for our mains dishes. How do we know, we spoke with our surrounding tables. One couple joked and said \"we thought the long wait was because they didn't like us\". We noticed how the men were constantly looking at their watches as they waited for their dishes. We noticed how the women looked around for the server to bring their mains. Mind you the restaurant was NOT packed. This was the day before Valentine's day. I can only imagine that the wait would possibly be doubled. Maybe if you were NON-ASIAN, your food might be served to you faster.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers. The escargot and foie gras. Those took about 20 minutes until there were served. For our mains we ordered the bavette and coq au vin which took about 50mins. 50 minutes, seriously. For dessert we ordered some type of chocolate cake and coffee. That took 10mins.\n\nWe arrived at 6pm. We left at 8:50pm. Over 2 and a half hours for 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert. If it wasn't for the glasses of wine we ordered and the wonderful company of my girlfriend, this dining experience definitely could have been a very, very disappointing night.\n\nIf you are asian, I advise you to dine else where as there are so many other wonderful places to eat in San Francisco. And when you go dine there, ensure that the restaurant does not segregate you to one section as Cafe Claude.\n\nOnce again, I am very disappointed with this establishment and will not dine here again.", "rating": 1, "date": "2016-02-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Especially big props on the Seared Foie Gras (properly rendered), Coq Au Vin (beautiful kick of red wine flavors coming through without being too thick, the meat just melted off the bones), Trout (this place executes it with perfection, and it was a great contrast with haricots vert and almonds, and the addition of raisins just added a right touch of sweetness). \n\n"], "author": "Natalie W.", "review": "Quite honestly one of my best experiences ever having French food!\n\nIt was a spontaneous thing, deciding to have French for dinner last night.

We live in Portland and a trip to Cafe Claude is always highly anticipated.  The food was always fantastic, reasonably priced, great service and a fun atmosphere.  We tell everyone to go there...\n\nThat being said, I am sad that I have to reduce my rating from 5 stars (I would have given it 10 stars in 2009) to 4.  They always treat us very well---our service was great again last night.  However, if I was rating the food only, I would reduce the rating to a 3.  I'm not sure what has happened, but the food has really diminished.  When I was reading through the reviews last week I was startled to see that there were several negative ones.  I figured they must be wrong.  Nope.\n\nThe escargot was delicious.  I was reasonably happy with the coq au vin.  I thought it was flavored well and tender. I am very sensitive to salt and did not think it was overly salty as others have said.   I would order it again.  My husband and son both ordered the duck confit.  The duck was tender, moist and full of flavor.  It was the plate itself that failed.  The lentils were terrible---dry and totally tasteless.  The frisee wasn't much better.  The duck could have been improved with a light port sauce or any type of sauce to accompany.  The duck would pair much better with a mashed potato, hash or a light pasta.  My husband commented that he felt the food had just been dumped on his plate with no caring.  \n\nAs always, the service was very nice.  We visited for our combined birthday/anniversary dinner and the manager brought us complimentary champagne.  Our server brought us a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert. VERY NICE touches and much appreciated!!!  Our waiter, who is French, was also outstanding.  The great service is why I am giving a 4 instead of a 3 for the restaurant overall.\n\nThis review is hard for me to write because we have been such big fans.  On our first and subsequent trips we would moan in pleasure with every bite we took.  This time, we were making excuses to each other to justify the food...\"They must have a new chef, must have someone new in the kitchen, it's still good, just not great, my coq au vin is pretty good....\"  It's not good when one goes there.  We just wanted to love it as we normally do.  We also heard the lady at the next table complaining about a corn cake and some others stating that it's not as good as it used to be.  The restaurant was not as full as it once was.  It used to be packed.  We had late reservations, so that could be why.  Or, it could be that word is getting out that it's just not as good anymore.  I hope Cafe Claude is listening and takes the words of their devoted customers to heart.  I would hate to see this once-wonderful place go out of business.\n\nOverall rating 4 due to the great service,  Food alone 3.  :(  Please work on fixing this so I can return Cafe Claude to my Favorite Restaurant in San Francisco!  We are returning in October and hope to see great improvements!  Also, my YELP profile asks where I want to eat my last meal on earth.  It has said Cafe Claude since 2009!

It's not really a big deal, but it seems like a lot of the service people accidentally step on each others toes. Bussers will take some plates, the waiter a few, some people get waters, some don't.

I also really like their glassware. If anything, maybe Cafe Claude is a great place for a cocktail and a couple appetizers, or maybe a cocktail and desert. The service, despite a bit on the side of amateur, is very friendly. They are always smiling and charming. This is a joy. The ambiance is nice. I enjoy the lighting, the table settings and decorations. The outside seating is enjoyable. \n\nTo conclude - I will not be coming back to Cafe Claude for dinner.

The ambiance is warm and nice, and we missed the only day that they don't play live jazz (darn!). Many people just had jeans and regular shirts on. Being a teenager, I thought it would be too grownup for me, but it wasn't extremely weird. Our waiter was super nice too.\n\nWe ordered the cauliflower soup (not on the menu), French Onion Soup, and the Truffle Mouse for appetizers. Cauliflower soup was amazing, but the French Onion wasn't the greatest. A bit of a muddled salty taste, but its hard to compare after having that soup in France. I also prefer Gruyere cheese, not Swiss. Also, my parents liked the one at Cafe Central better. I personally loved the Truffle Mousse, so full of flavor and a great combo with the dijon mustard and little pickles. \n\nI got the cider brined tenderloin. Had an amazing jus and the pork was moist and flavorful; probably the best dish I've had in a while. My sister got the salmon with Israeli couscous. The salmon was lacking in flavor, but the couscous tasted great. My dad got the lamb sirloin medium-well (we don't like pink meat too much). It was a bit dry, but had good flavor. The chickpeas and vegetables were a bit odd, but tasted pretty good. My mom got the coq au vin (chicken w/red wine, bacon, etc). She wasn't too crazy about it, and didn't really expect the chicken to be on bone, but the sauce was really flavorful. \n\nDessert was moelleux au chocolate (flourless chocolate cake).

The outdoor seating area was packed full as was the restaurant inside (in sharp contrast to its neighbor, Gitane, just down the alley which appeared empty at 7pm). The ambiance was nice - dark, small tables, intimate.\n\nWe ordered a plate of charcuterie, the coq au vin, the bouillabaise, and a side of pomme frites. The waitress seemed very informed when she rattled off wine to pair with our entrees and we went with her suggestions.\n\nThe first red flag was the bread placed on the table. Sliced baguette that was stale. Oh, it's probably a fluke, I chided myself. Slather on some more butter!\n\nOur pathetic plate of charcuterie turned up. An uninspired selection of 3 cuts. Not particularly flavorful, rich, or interesting, served with cornichons, 3 dabs of mustard and 4 slices of bread. For $19. Ouch. Still, I convinced myself that the entrees would be better.\n\nThe wine arrived, huzzah! That excitement fizzled when I tried my \"bold, full bodied white wine\" - it was boring, that kind of bad wine that's been open and sitting around funky. My girlfriend's red was no better. \n\nOn to entrees! My bouillabaise seemed promising - the monk fish was cooked well and the mussels were bouncy perfection. Unfortunately the dish was ruined by being almost unbearably salty. I ate the seafood because I hate to waste food and I think I was still trying to convince myself that it was good. But I could not finish the bouillabaise or the hunk of bread soaking up what should have been delicious broth. For $26 how could it be this bad?? \n\nI hoped the coq au vin would save the day but my girlfriend said it was average at best. I tried a taste - the chicken and sauce were decidedly sour.

I'd rather go to a different restaurant and be served fresh raw meat than stay at a restaurant where the freshness could be questionable. \n\nSo, the server at Cafe de la Presse recommended Cafe Claude for Steak Tartare and we headed over, resigned to the fact that we were probably going to end up eating cheap Chinese in Chinatown.\n\nWe were mistaken.\n\nCafe Claude not only has one of the cutest outdoor alleyway set ups in San Francisco (with heat lamps), but the interior of the restaurant is a very good replication of what you would find in Paris on a warm summer's night, complete with warm incandescent lighting, fans rotating overhead and a dark wood bar near the entrance. You can almost feel Toulouse-Lautrec, Balzec or Verne hovering over their French comfort food in the warmly lit and secluded corner booths.\n\nThe BF and I shared a large Steak Tartare, complete with a raw quail egg, diced cornichons, relish, finely chopped parsley, shallots, and mustard. We added a couple of drops of Tabasco and worcestshire to the mound of boeuf and mixed our own with glee. \n\nThis was the first time he had tasted Tartare, and he loved it. The chuck was very fresh, with a good amount of fat mixed in. The seasoning was perfect. I think my only comment would be to have either more quail eggs or just one good large cage-free chicken egg to bind the ground chuck more. \n\nYet, I still say YUM.\n\nWe also split a Coq au Vin, which is a homestyle chicken stew braised in red wine. Although I highly doubt they pick out roosters for this dish, it was fragrant and hearty, with the chicken meat falling delicately off the bone and chunks of mushrooms and pearl onions.

One goat, one Brie and a mild bleu. \n\nCocktails. Best name for a French cafe cocktail ever: Zidane Coup a Tete. Binky had this, and I believe it had 3 or 4 different alcohols mixed in.

(Lunch)\nFrench 75 - This has got to be the tastiest champagne cocktail ever!  I forget exactly whats in this but I believe its rosee with grapefruit and lime juices - packs a nice punch and fizz, especially for an afternoon lunch or brunch.  I really liked this one, plus it looks pretty!\n\nCheese Plate w/ Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry, pica portuguese, Runchon - This was such a GOOD deal.  Cheese plate was only $16 and had huge slices of fabulous cheese.  The Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry was soft, creamy and absolutely, RIDICULOUSLY yummy with a hint of sweetness on the tongue; Pica was very creamy and had a brie-like texture with a nice milky smell, and the Runchon was fabulous with the dates and honey supplied on the plate.  \n\nCroque Madame w/ Pommes Frites & Salad - HOOOOOMG.  The Croque Madame PWNS any sammich out there. Straight up... PWNS.  Crisp toasted bread with ham, and grueyre cheese melted with a lovely sunnyside egg on top?  What the F*XOrz.  It was so good.  The pommes frites were thin and crispy but the insides were not soggy and the dipping sauce was just right! This plate even had an accompanying salad, that was drizzled with olive oil (I presume). PERFECT. \n \nQuiche Lorraine - only having a bite of this. I'd have to say it was pretty damn good. But i really did prefer my Croque Madame much better :D\n\n-----------------------------\nPigging out - Second Round - GO! (Dinner)\n\nLe Petit Ecolier - Tasty little bugger, but not much alcohol in it.  I would suggest something else if you're interested in a *real* cocktail. \n\nPommes Frites - Very good, same rating as above in the Lunch portion of the review.\n\nEscargot - Okay, snails - probably not exactly the food you'd eat everyday, but hello, if I can eat cow tongue and not flinch then I think I can handle some wimpy little snails.  F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!!!!  Kinda expensive for $10 for 5 little snails, but damn were they good.  Baked in some sort of special crockery with five little holes topped with round disks of baked bread or some sort of flaky pastry all broiled under a tasty oily concotion.  It was like SUPER MINI SNAIL POT PIE.  YUM.  YUM!!!\n \nFlank Steak - Very very well done \"medium rare\" steak.  Cooked on the outer edges with a good rare on the inside, this steak was yummy though I wish I would have had the Coq au Vin for my main dish. \n\nCoq au Vin - What praise I have for this dish.  Fabulous, hearty, rich and absolutely satisfying any time or place.  Soft, falling off the bone chicken with pearl onions, bacon and a wonderful wine sauce.  Not too salty, not too bland, just perfect!  Loved this; I had to stop myself from stealing it all from a hungry bear! \n\n------------\n\nResult: Me= KO and Cafe Claude = WINS AGAIN!\n\n\nReally though, a fabulous bistro with great atmosphere and better than average service.

I personally believe this makes a big difference especially in the restaurant biz, where the work can be grueling and dealing with the public can be draining. When employees have a passion for what their company represents (or their \"mission\") and can be proud of the product coming out of (in this case) the kitchen - your clientele picks up on this consciously or subconsciously.\n\nSo needless to say the atmosphere is truly wonderful. It's just as much about the employees as the beautiful decor. We started at the bar where the bartender was super nice even though it was very busy. This is something we rarely ever encounter in Washington, DC (bad service town). It was even more refreshing since it was our first time - the bar is small and most everyone else seemed like a regular. We were being treated no differently! How nice. :) The cocktails were strong but balanced and delicious.\n\nI thought the jazz trio was fabulous. They had a singer on a few songs - really nice. These musicians, as well as the singer, are real true-to-life artists. We don't get that at Washington restaurants which made me appreciate them all the more.\n\nAfter about 20-30 minutes at the bar we were seated at our table within 5 or 10 minutes of our reservation. Now this is something that frequently is *not* the case when we have reservations at a Washington restaurant. We're on time but for some reason we cannot get seated until 30-45 mins PAST our rsv. This was not the case at Cafe Claude and was a refreshing change from our experiences at home.\n\nOur waiter was super nice, funny and knowledgeable about the food and wine. We only ordered entrees but he didn't try to up sell or if he did was so casual about it I forgot. This is also another technique which the staff at Cafe Claude could teach to Washington restaurant employees. While I understand the need for up selling - there's a right and wrong way to go about it. Here it was the right way.\n\nAlthough we did not do appetizers we did share a dessert and it was just as delicious as our main courses (which were btw coq au vin, the best we've ever had and pork tenderloin another *the-best-of* ). \n\nWe also ended up ordering cognac and a brandy with our dessert (tart tatin). It was autumn and it just made the dessert and after dinner drinks perfect. \n\nSo restauranteurs, there is no need for your staff to engage in the \"up sell\" if what you offer is thoughtfully prepared delicious and graciously served. \n\nCafe Claude was and still is one of the very best restaurant experience we've had  and will always be tops in our travels on our next visit.\n\nPS - If mgrs, chef or owner(s) read these reviews and have any heart for those of us living far far away from your beautiful restaurant and charming city, is there any way possible to get the recipe for your coq au vin?

The GM, Cinzia, is a perky, sweet Milanese woman who tells entertaining stories with an adorable Italian accent to boot. Their sommelier is Sean, who also does the list for Gitane right next door. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience here yet. This is biased though, as they know me and know that I send a lot of my hotel guests here since it's great and just around the corner. \n\nThe menu is classic French bistro food, which would I would choose for my last meal if it ever came down to that.  \n\nBest items on the menu are:  the onion soup, which is perfectly and delicately flavored, not the saltwater that most places try to pass off as French onion soup. The pat\u00e9 is house made and deliciously rich. I'm a huge fan of the escargot en croute and the steak tartare, which has a roughly chopped texture to it which I love. They prepare the tartare tableside as well. \n\nThe coq au vin is a rooster braised in wine for hours so it falls off the bone, wonderfully tender and rich. The lamb is quite good as well. Everything reasonably priced, in my opinion.\n\nNow for the beverage side. \n\nThe list is is almost entirely French with about eight California selections. Most of the wines on this list are under $100, and all very reasonably priced. I love bev programs like this because the wines are super good value. Ask for Alex if you need help navigating the list, he is extremely knowledgeably and good-natured. \n\nIf you're looking for a wine white and can deal with some residual sugar, try Francois Chidaine's \"Les Tuffeaux\", a semi-sweet chenin blanc from Montlouis in the Loire valley. The wine is a steal, with a huge amount of complexity. Very traditional producer making single-vineyard chenin blanc. \n\nCafe Claude also has a nice cocktail list, in a similar vein to Gitane but with all different items. They also have a selection of absinthes and pastis which is icing on the cake for me. \n\nDid I mention live jazz on weekends?", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-06-27"}, {"excerpts": ["But half way through it, the waitress brought out the main course (we had both ordered the coq au vin)!

GF ordered a delicious sounding margarita type thing and I ordered something that I attempted to pronounce with a french accent. When in Rome. Our waiter was not amused, and sternly told me that he clearly speaks english. Hmm. Not off to a great start.

I devoured the Paleron Sauce Poivre Vert (flat iron steak with a wonderful chessy baked mashed potato formed into a circular mound and French style green beans $22.00 (two orders) and my other guest order the Coq Au Vin (chicken marinated in red wine with all the usual trimmings for this classic dish) $20.00 along with a side order of their famous spicy Pommes Frites (French fries) $5.00!\n\nSince it was my guests birthday dinner, we finished with the Coconut Flan $7.00,  Apple Tarte Tatin $7.00 with a side of a la Mode $1.00, and Moelluex Chocolat (chocolate souffle) $7.00.

It's just a few little steps down Claude Lane, off of Bush St near Grant, and it's the cutest little spot for a tete a tete. \n\nMy hubby and I were staying at Hotel Des Arts, just a couple doors down, and made reservations for dinner at Cafe Claude on the recommendation of a fellow Yelper. My first impression started at the phone call. The woman was very friendly, and she didn't act like I was calling last minute for a spot the next evening. She simply told me that either of the times I requested were available, and happily booked me for one of them.\n\nThen, when we arrived, the hostess greeted us with a friendly, \"Bonsoir!\" took our names, and walked us to a nice little softly lit table. \n\nThe waiter (wish I could remember his name) with a French accent, was SO helpful with our choices... even to recommending that I not order the haricot verts with the coq au vin because it wasn't a great combination, and he suggested the soup du jour, which we both LOVED... it was a cream of bell pepper soup, which my hubby finished completely, so the waiter left his spoon in case he wanted to help me finish mine.

Not only that, but they give you the little solitaire shaker so you can top yourself off when you finish up your first glass! Can you say halleluja? HALLELUJA, mes soeurs et mes freres!  \n\nAt the end of our meal, we looked at the damage and were happily surprised that with our four drinks, soups, main courses, side dish and dessert, that we came just to $100. That is, until the waiter realized that he'd left the cheese plate on there and took it off, and then our total was UNDER $100!  Can you believe it? We were ready to pay and they tell us, 'Oops! We charged you too much, let us take that off your bill...' \n\nBetween the cozy romantic feel of the place, to the delicious food, to the excellent service and affordable price, I'd have to say that this was one of my favorite dining experiences in San Francisco.

It's quite amazing that when we touched base that day, we both came up with Cafe Claude.\n\nThe venue itself is tucked away into the many nooks and crannies the FiDi possesses.  If you walk by the alley while on the phone, you'd be sure to miss it.  But once you pass the uninviting pseudo wall blockers, you'd find yourself whisked away into a seemingly another city.  The French speaking Asian lady-owner quickly hosts you to an assortment of tables both inside and out.  We sat outside, heat lamps on.  The atmosphere appears to be frequented by Financial District business people that know the best kept French secret in town.  However, we did sit next to a table of French gangsters with their import cigarettes (they got up and smoked elsewhere like gentlemen),  white pants, no socks, and skinny shirts with the collar wide open.  That actually was a plus to the whole experience.  Just to hear a table of people laughing and speaking French.\n\nOnce inside, the place opens up to 10 or so tables.  A live jazz band is squished into the corner.  A tad loud, but the music selection was smooth and nonabrasive.  An 8 stool bar and a hellava wine list helps to ease the wait.  And on a Saturday night with 8:30PM reservations, I would say it was at full capacity, with patrons still waiting for a table.  The place is quaint but the vaulted ceiling made it feel just right.  Warm low set lights and candles kept the joint hazy and optimal for sharing that nice red.  They boast quite a wine list, but unfortunately, its not online.  The decor is a mix of strategically placed frames and photos - trendy, but not so much where it gets too mind boggling.   Good masculine and feminine balance.\n\nAll servers were French and spoke with a thick French accent - very nice touch.  The service was professional, a bit dry but fair, not too much on the entree suggestion pitch, but overall way above par.\n\nBrochette - $12 black tiger prawn salad with mango, etc.  Yum.  Tasty scrimps.\nTartare de Thon Rouge - $12 raw ahi tuna, goat cheese, quail egg.  tuna was fresh and firm, goat cheese was almost Philadelphia Cream Cheese-ish.  Not a fan of the cream cheese.\nCoq Au Vin  $17 - chicken with red wine sauce, bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions.  very tasty and dense.  chicken was off the bone tender.  sauce was a mild reduction with a very herbal scent.  good stuff.\nAgneau $23 - roasted lamb sirloin - these deli pre-sliced lamb slivers had a lot of taste.  however, the medium rare ordered came out a tad too raw.  The intramuscular fat (marbling) was undercooked giving it a little chewiness and yes, you guessed it, a need for dental floss.  But the sauce was mildly tart and delicious.\nPommes Frites $5 - Must have frites.  Perfect seasoned and fried.\nTarte Tatin  $7 - the upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  eh, actually was disappointed with the inverted apple pie from 7/11.  the apples were overdone and soggy, it looked real dark, and the taste was can-like.   Pass.\n\nOverall, the experience est bonne.  You still get that city-feel with the sounds of blaring of taxicab horns without all the visuals.  You really do feel transported to a private French cafe.  There are no other restaurants in that alley, so it has that exclusive feel.  Our server let us dine for hours, without interruption or hint-dropping.  Definitely a great place to intimately share a great meal, tap a bottle of wine, and ultimately create long lasting memories.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["For our main course, he had the \"coq au vin\" - a chicken stew marinated for 5 hours ", "and he devoured it.

We sat and chatted for a while, sipping on Bastille Bellinis.    Our waiter came by several times to see if we were ready to order.  We couldn't decide right away.

Chicken was moist, and I made use of the sauce with the dinner bread provided.  I didn't realize that sides had to be ordered separately, but it was ok.  It was just the right amount of food for me (actually, I wouldn't have minded seconds).  We passed on dessert this time, but I'm sure there will be a chance to sample it another time.

"], "author": "Vivienne K.", "review": "Cafe Claude, you are a French Cloude floating amid the SF financial district.  A little piece of Paris for the hefty price of San Francisco - a little food staycation for those that want more than food... like jam (no, not the fruity jar-ed kind - the melodic kind). I like that this restaurant integrates a musical live jazz experience with the romantic French prose of food - the escargot; the wine; the French onion soup; the chocolate soft cake.  It is an experience for the taste buds - and for the ear buds over a most memorable experience with your best buds (the human ones).  \n\nIt is nice that the people running the restaurant are  from France, and are very helpful and kind in making recommendations and providing decent service (though it could have been a bit more efficient). \n\nWhat dishes did I enjoy?\n\n(1) The escargots en croute.  I liked the buttery, garlic and parsley infused reduction with shallots and anchovy - and how the escargot were baked in like delicate swirled angels sleeping in a puff pastry blanket.  \n\n(2) My favorite dish was the french onion soup (soup a l'oignon). And is the oignON spot ON. My only constructive criticism about this dish is that I wish it were less salty. However, the onion soup gratinee had a most beautiful red wine aftertaste that married well with the melting emMENTAL cheese that is a mental wonderland. The baguette crouton was sliced in the perfect thickness to create a golden ratio of onion soup. \n\n(3) Actually - I take that back. My actual favorite dish was the dessert. The Moelleux au Chocolat was in fact my favorite dish here.  The soft chocolate cake was not too sweet - which I appreciated as the bitterness of the chocolate was able to come through to surface in its natural roughness. The Creme Anglaise vanilla sauce was poured in, melding in with the chocolate to form a chocolate-creme anglaise combination that was black and white harmony at its most intimate peak. \n\nWhat dishes could have used perhaps a little more thoughtfulness?\n\n(A) The Casserole de Champignon. The ingredients were great - the farro verde, the king trumpet mushrooms, the carrots, the broccolini and kale.  I just wish there were more flavor other than butter. And I wish that there was more to it. I am a person who appreciates simplicity when it comes to good food - but there is simplicity done thoughtfully and tastefully and simplicity done in the other direction. I am afraid this fell in the latter category. \n\n(B) Confit de Canard. The duck was crisp, but it came at the expense of moisture, for I have never eaten such a dry piece of duck in my life. I was also a bit disappointed at the portion size. I did appreciate the warm puy lentils and the fris\u00e9e; and I enjoyed the flavor of course mustard against the duck.  \n\nCafe Claude, I applaude that you share a little piece of France - and beautiful live music with it - in the oft busy SF life.

It had this puff pastry on top that went perfect with it, and then we dipped the bread from the bread basket into the leftover pesto sauce. The beef tar tar was alright, it has a more sour taste than we would have liked, and the presentation probably could have been better. My sisters were not into eating something that looked like a plopped down brain but they're also younger.

Alsatian tarte flambee (puff pastry, caramelized onions, creme fraiche, bacon lardons): Mmm buttery flakey puff pastry! The sweet caramelized onions, luscious creme fraiche, and hammy bacon were excellent toppings, all outstanding on their own and balanced in flavor and texture by the endives. Curiously, it's built like a taco and looks like a taco, but way fancy.\n\n2. Carbonnade flamande (Flemish beer-braised beef, pearl onions, winter root vegetable puree): Frankly I was disappointed with the portion size, but if you eat it reeeeaaaaallllllllyy sloowwwwwwwwlllyyyyyy and mindfully appreciate the nuances, you will be more satisfied because you will notice the culinary finesse going into this dish (and also because it will last longer and feel less small). The beef is so tender, you could probably sneak it into someone's juice cleanse without them noticing\n\n3. Choux aux chantilly (almond profiteroles, vanilla bean cream, orange gastrique): Tasty and a nice sweet dessert at the end of the meal, but nothing too special and it's somewhat difficult to taste the almonds and the orange.

Following Google Maps, we were directed into a shady little alleyway tucked away within the vast SF urban landscape. But shady it was not! Quite the opposite...it was packed with a decent handful of restaurants, with loads of outdoor seating.\n\nUpon entering Cafe Claude, we were whisked away into a very charming French restaurant with an amazing ambiance. The dim lighting, the incredibly talented jazz band, the intimate seating (esp. for two)...it was all very romantic.\n\nWe were seating right away, early even, at a table in the corner of the restaurant. Our server came by immediately, and was very helpful and polite. She provided some excellent cocktail recommendations, and attended to our every need. She even brought out what looked like a giant nail filer to whisk away the crumbs off the table after our meal and having finished the bread. (Sad to say, I just might be uncultured, seeing as I've never encountered a restaurant that does this. Completely mind-blown when I saw this.)\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Confit de Canard, while I opted for the Porc. For cocktails, my girlfriend ordered the Hummingbird, while I got the Vieux Carre.

The meat complimented really well with the lentils and greens.\n\nThe Porc was amazing! Cooked medium, and placed on top of a delicious stew of sweet potato, cabbage, and other goodies, I was completely satisfied with my dish. The meet was really tender, cooked to perfection, and still quite moist.\n\n**Amusing fact** - as the waiter brought us our food, he exclaimed: \"watch out, the plates are hot.\" Oh indeed they were, sir!! Quite a surprise to see Cafe Claude doesn't warm up their plates, but heats them to a very high temp - excellent to keep the food warm throughout the meal!\n\nBack to the review~\n\nOur cocktails were really good. The Hummingbird - a mixture of St. Germain Elderflower liquer, sparkling wine, soda water, and fresh lemon juice - was well made, and the perfect light cocktail for my girlfriend. A solid recommendation by our amazing waitress.\n\nMy Vieux Carre - a combination of cognac, rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters - was also a solid drink, touched with a slice of orange rind. In comparison to another vieux carre I've had at a fancy SF speakeasy, I'd say this probably takes the cake. Rather than the dry taste you get from some vodka or gin drinks, this had a really heavy, flavored taste from start to finish. It also went well with the Porc dish.\n\nTo round things up, the dessert tasted great! Their creme brulee was really smooth, compounded with an intense vanilla flavor, and a nicely caramelized crust on top. My girlfriend and I were left wanting more afterwards, but after all the food, we were both quite full towards the end.\n\nOverall, an amazing dining experience. A very romantic/intimate place to bring that special someone for any special occasion, or if you're just in the mood for something different.

We both agreed that we would LOVE to find that French restaurant we went to for lunch back when we were dating and since I remembered what street it was on but not the name, I simply googled \"french restaurant by bush street\" and this place came up on top.  I was 100% it was the place because the name sounded so familiar so we gave it a try! Didn't take long to find parking (thank goodness) and we saw the nostalgic ally way it hides in and we were SO happy! They weren't too busy either so we were able to get seats pretty fast.  You would not believe how nostalgic that place was to us.  It was definitely a different setting and some decorations were different (I mean, come on, it's been YEARS since the last time we were both here) but we had so much fun recalling where we were sitting, what was around, and etc.  \n\nSo a few years ago we came here for lunch and ordered some sandwiches with pommes frites which are delicious.  I love thin fries and it's what they serve here.  This time around, we were here for dinner and I seriously wanted to try everything. We started off with the pommes frites of course and escargot (the last time I had it was in France so I had some expectations of it).  The escargot did NOT disappoint me at all.

"], "author": "Donovan H.", "review": "When visiting San Francisco, it can be a real challenge finding an ideal French restaurant that blends romantic, intimate, and classy. With that said and done, \"Cafe Claude\" offers everything you're looking for in a cozy and ambient atmosphere. And surprisingly, for a city that has an endless list of award-winning restaurants, finding somewhere to dine was trickier than I had anticipated.\n\nLocated directly in the heart of the Financial District and only a few blocks from Union Square, \"Cafe Claude\" is actually tucked on an alley way. Parking in this part of town can be very scarce any day of the week so its best to use public transportation or take a cab. However, on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm, I was able to score a parking spot less than 2 blocks away which doesn't happen very often in downtown San Francisco.\n\nI come here with my fianc\u00e9e, Claudia as I had already made reservations (via-Open Table) prior to arrival. As expected, the restaurant was bustling with hungry customers inside and out. And when I say out, there is a large area where people are seated outside; I'd have to say that I am not entirely thrilled by it as it takes away a lot of the charm of the restaurant. Fortunately, we were seated inside and placed directly in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe overall interior is as French and European as you can get.  Everything from the decor to the French artwork placed on the walls, this place truly feels as if you're dining in Paris. Keep in mind that the inside is relatively small so don't be discouraged if you happen to eavesdrop in your neighbors conversations. One thing that had me sold on dining here is that \"Cafe Claude\" offers live jazz music Wednesday through Sunday. This was one of the major reasons what inspired me to dine here as French cuisine and jazz music go hand in hand.\n\nAs we were seated, our waitress explains some of the specialties of what they're offering. Now I don't like to criticize but her French accent was a bit hard at times to understand but fortunately I was able to pick up most of the words. We brought a bottle of our red wine where they will charge a $20.00 corkage fee. As an appetizer, we decided on splitting their \"Ch\u00e8vre\" (for $14.00). This was a salad that consisted of baby lettuce, warm goat cheese, toasted levain, apples, candied walnuts, and drizzled with cider vinegar. Our salad comes out within 5 minutes and is complemented with a French baguette.\n\nAs far as our main entrees, I decide on ordering the \"Coq Au Vin\" (for $24.00). This meal is a free-range chicken that includes bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrots, and red wine sauce. My fianc\u00e9e decided on the \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" (for $23.00). Her dish is a complete roasted half chicken paired up with seasonal greens, Ni\u00e7oise olives (which were omitted from her dish by request), rosemary, and lemon. Both of our dishes arrived within 20 minutes.\n\nAt first glance, the servings that are offered at \"Cafe Claude\" are very generous. You definitely get your moneys worth as the entire presentation was simple yet effective. I was pleasantly surprised with the how tasty my \"Coq Au Vin\" was. The red wine sauce had a zesty flavor that complimented well with the tender pieces of chicken. It also had a unique homemade taste that is not found at a classy French restaurant and something that I would enjoy at my mom's house. I also tried some of my fianc\u00e9es \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" as this was extremely tasty. The chicken was very moist as it had the perfect amount of lemon and rosemary that balanced out the dish very well.\n\nSince we still had a little room left for dessert, we decided on going the safe route in ordering their \"Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" and 2 glasses of champagne to go with it. That hit the spot as it had the perfect amount of crust on top with the creamy filling underneath. Overall, if you're looking for an above average French restaurant in San Francisco, \"Cafe Claude\" is a restaurant worth checking out. Was it the best I've had? No, but it was very good and you won't be disappointed.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-10-19"}, {"excerpts": ["- Poulet R\u00f4ti - half roasted chicken with lemon, ni\u00e7oise olives, rosemary, and saut\u00e9ed swiss chard - always consistent here!\n\n           "], "author": "Manda Bear B.", "review": "**************** REVIEW 416 ******************\n\n            Cafe Claude is 1 of my favorite spots for date night, Happy Hour, and also when shopping with mom.

When cafes opened on Belden Alley and began serving dinner al fresco I was mystified.  This was the same alley that housed dumpsters full of restaurant waste all day and down which I'd seen rats routinely darting.  Cafe Claude opened on another alley, Claude Lane, and I felt similarly though I'll admit to enjoying a post-work drink there now and then.  \n\nIt'd been years since my last visit but on this evening I walked here from the new MOMA with friends in tow who knew not where we were headed.  What still looked like sort of an abysmally dark alley was seen through their fresh eyes as we ventured down the lane.  Then, stepping into Cafe Claude we were greeted in a way that helped overcome any reticence I might have been wrestling with.  \n\nAll eyes in my party lit with joy when we entered to a trio of jazz musicians (sultry femme singer included) in Cafe Claude's entry.  It seemed as though we'd stumbled into a very well-known (to others) secret and it felt both romantic and very special.  Remember this place if those are the feelings you're going for.  \n\nNo one was sitting outside and it still looked less than appealing to me.  Indoors, however, was packed.  Two tight rooms full of diners enjoying French bistro fare and wine with musical accompaniment.  Ooh la la, tres chic.    \n\nDespite what was an overly long wait between first course and entree (and for which no explanation was given), the food and service here were good, enhanced by the ambiance.  I enjoyed traditional Soupe A L'Oignon ($11) and a Salade with Lardons.  The Steak Frites ($28) wasn't best in class but it was still good and worked well in this environment.  Others at my table had Trout Amandine ($25) and Coq Au Vin ($24) and registered satisfaction.    \n\nDespite falling off my radar the fact that Cafe Claude is still packing them into the FiDi on a weekend night says something for the appeal of their offering.  Be certain to visit on a night with live jazz (Thursday - Saturday, 7 - 10 p.m.) as it'll smooth over any minor flaws and deliver what I'll now call a perfect ambiance.  \n\nIn a dark San Francisco alley.

The interior is pretty small, but the booth seating makes it more comfy and cozy. It seems like most of the seating is made up of the covered seating out front. Dining outdoors in Claude Lane is almost a nod to the sidewalk cafes in France, while the dim lighting inside is a more intimate setting. On weekends, there is live music that lightly emanates in the background. Even better, they sometimes have 1000-pt. Opentable reservations.\nMr. Joy & I were taking in the ambience when certain details felt familiar and I realized I had been here before. Has anyone else ever had a deja vu dining experience? Anyway...\n\nWe started with fresh bread wrapped in newsprint with butter filled to the brim of a ramekin. So many delicious things on the menu. Between the mussels, duck confit, & coq au vin, I had a hard time choosing.\n\n$14 Steak Tartare - hand chopped raw flank steak, quail egg, mustard, cornichons, capers, shallots, parsley, croutons:\nThe tartare was prepared tableside, but the tables were too close together. Our server's mixing station was out of my line of vision, so I couldn't really see what was going on. The end result revealed a smooth and creamy steak tartare. The accompanying ingredients were easy to pick out and had a mild tartness, but weren't too strong and didn't overpower the steak. The thin, buttery slices of baked baguette were thin, crunchy vessels for the tartare.\n\n$28 Steak Frites - bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise sauce, pommes frites:\nThe flank steak was a small portion, but it was still pretty juicy for a lean cut of beef, especially with the bordelaise sauce. The bone marrow butter, surprisingly, was green. Mr. Joy, the fry connoisseur, also said the frites were very good - crispy and seasoned well with herbs.\n\n$24 Coq au Vin - mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrot, red wine sauce:\nClaude makes coq au vin just how I like it. It was served in a cast-iron dish, which helped keep it warm throughout the meal. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Next to the chicken, the cipollini onions are my favorite part. They just taste taste so sweet and juicy. Their red wine sauce, surprisingly, was rather light in color. It still had the savory, tart, and buttery notes of a red wine sauce though. The consistency is not very thick, but I prefer the sauce to be not too heavy. Like some coq au vin dishes that I've tried in France, it tastes like chicken sitting in a rich broth as opposed to a thick sauce. The only thing minor thing I would have changed was they could have cut the carrots smaller so it would have been easier to eat.\n\nWe left with satisfied taste buds and full bellies after realizing we had consumed a nearly all meat meal. Well, as true carnivores, it wasn't all that surprising. Service was as delightful as the food. Our server was very sweet & friendly, and spoke with an enviable French accent.

I'm in SF for a week and I fully expected to fall in love and eat there every day for the rest of my visit. Unfortunately, I was disappointed from the moment I walked in the door.\n\nI arrived at 1:35 for a 1:45 lunch reservation. The hostess met me at the door and the first thing out of her mouth was \"Do you have a reservation?\" (Note: it was obviously the end of lunch time with several open tables inside the small dining room and the remaining diners clearly reaching the end of their meals). When I told her I had a 1:45 reservation she pointed out that I was 10 minutes early and they had not turned over my table yet. She asked if I wanted to sit outside instead, which I did not. She directed me to wait at the bar and handed me a cocktail menu and wine list to peruse while I waited.\n\nAfter maybe five minutes the hostess informed me my table was ready and brought me to the worst table in the dining room - a two top at the end of the banquette with a large column on one side. It was such a tight corner that the chair for a second diner was at a 90 degree angle to the banquette instead of across from it and about 25% of the table was actually pushed up to/in front of the corner column. I squeezed my way between the tables to sit on the banquette where I basically had no room to use my left arm and sat with my left hand in my lap the whole time. There was a four top table next to me with two older ladies at it and on the other side of them were two open tables.\n\nAfter a couple more minutes my server came over and just said \"We have a soup of the day, it's beef and vegetable.\" and then just looked at me. I asked for sparkling water with lime. She may have given a quick nod and then walked away.\n\nSeveral minutes later (and with no water) the server returned and literally said \"Are you ready to go?\" I asked about my water and she explained that she has to wait for the bartender to get the bottle for her. There had been no one at the bar since before I entered the restaurant, so I'm not sure what the hold up was. I ordered the salade maison to start and the steak frites medium rare with a side of aioli.\n\nA few minutes later the hostess who originally sat me came over with my bottle of sparking water and a glass - but no lime. A couple minutes after that my salad arrived.\n\nThe salad was very good - the champagne vinaigrette was just right and the lettuce was fresh - and I really enjoyed it. When I was finished my server cleared my plate and left a steak knife but left my fork (I kind of expected a clean fork for each course).\n\nSteak frites showed up and, no surprise, no side of aioli. After a couple of minutes my server noticed I had received my food and remembered I had asked for aioli, which she then brought over. It was orange, so I asked what it was seasoned with and she told me it was harissa. Seems a little odd for a French place and I really didn't care for the flavor with the frites, but my only other options were ketchup or spicy mustard. The steak and marrow butter were very good and cooked perfectly, but I seem to have been missing the port-shallot sauce.\n\nAdditionally, there did not appear to be any bread offered during lunch. If a place is going to advertise themselves as \"A virtual European vacation tucked in the heart of San Francisco's financial district near Union Square, this charming French restaurant provides a Paris fix via \"tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licieux\" cuisine, exquisite service and lovely Left Bank atmosphere.\" I kind of expect to have some baguette and butter.\n\nTo summarize, the food was quite good but the service I received was a huge let-down and I will not be going back.

But if you call something coq au vin, it should have some red wine flavor. I couldn't really find much.\n\n*Steak frites: new york steak, bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise, pommes frites ($28)\nSo I ordered my steak rare. But this came out blue. It was still raw in the middle! I was already full by this course, so I didn't really care. And we were bringing it home for the roommate to reheat and eat later, so I didn't say anything.\n\n*Creme brulee: made with tahitian vanilla ($8)\nNice crusty top, but super runny for a creme brulee. I liked the flavor though.\n\nThe service, however, was excellent. Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating. She coursed everything so we'd have a nicely paced dinner.

The arugula was fine but didn't really match well. \n\nFortunately the server was very considerate and removed the appetizer and moved us on to the main course. I had the flat iron Steak Frites. And my boyfriend had the Coq Au Vin. My steak was cooked perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed the Bordelaise Sauce. I tried to scoop up every bit of sauce with the fries. The slice of herb butter that they put on top of it was ok but I wish it would have been melted on top as opposed to just sitting cold on the steak. My BF liked his chicken but said it wasn't anything amazing.\n\nWhen offered dessert we thought \"why not?\" So we got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I also got a cappuccino, which was amazing. I dunked the little dark chocolate they gave us to make it a slightly more sugar blasted sweet sip. When we tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e it was pretty good. It tasted a little too milky and you could tell that the custard hadn't hardened quite enough to be ready for br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Oh well I still liked it. \n\nWe did have to wait quite a while for our check. The manager/hostess? said that she had to do a tar tar service which slowed here down. One would think that she would help out and bring the check for the server? \n\nI don't think I'd come back to Claude. It was just ok. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the live jazz band.

Between the mussels, duck confit, & coq au vin, I had a hard time choosing.\n\n$14 Steak Tartare - hand chopped raw flank steak, quail egg, mustard, cornichons, capers, shallots, parsley, croutons:\nThe tartare was prepared tableside, but the tables were too close together. Our server's mixing station was out of my line of vision, so I couldn't really see what was going on. The end result revealed a smooth and creamy steak tartare. The accompanying ingredients were easy to pick out and had a mild tartness, but weren't too strong and didn't overpower the steak. The thin, buttery slices of baked baguette were thin, crunchy vessels for the tartare.\n\n$28 Steak Frites - bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise sauce, pommes frites:\nThe flank steak was a small portion, but it was still pretty juicy for a lean cut of beef, especially with the bordelaise sauce. The bone marrow butter, surprisingly, was green. Mr. Joy, the fry connoisseur, also said the frites were very good - crispy and seasoned well with herbs.\n\n$24 Coq au Vin - mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrot, red wine sauce:\nClaude makes coq au vin just how I like it. It was served in a cast-iron dish, which helped keep it warm throughout the meal. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Next to the chicken, the cipollini onions are my favorite part. They just taste taste so sweet and juicy. Their red wine sauce, surprisingly, was rather light in color. It still had the savory, tart, and buttery notes of a red wine sauce though. The consistency is not very thick, but I prefer the sauce to be not too heavy. Like some coq au vin dishes that I've tried in France, it tastes like chicken sitting in a rich broth as opposed to a thick sauce. The only thing minor thing I would have changed was they could have cut the carrots smaller so it would have been easier to eat.\n\nWe left with satisfied taste buds and full bellies after realizing we had consumed a nearly all meat meal. Well, as true carnivores, it wasn't all that surprising. Service was as delightful as the food. Our server was very sweet & friendly, and spoke with an enviable French accent.

I enjoyed this dish.\n\nHouse Pate Assortment:  duck rillettes, chicken liver mousse, pork campange.  My favorite was the chicken liver mousse.  So good.  It also had some mustard, grape thing.

The caf\u00e9 is tuck away in a narrow alley bordering Union Square and the FiDi.

Our first course was their pate plate, a choice of their three house made pates.  We went with the rillette du perigord, sauterne mousse, and truffle mouse.  The rillette was made with shredded duck meat and duck fat.  Honestly, it was my least favorite because it conflicted so much with the other selections.  The sauterne was quite nice.  This combination of chicken liver, truffles, and cepes had a sweet aftertaste and a pleasant texture.  The truffle mousse was outstanding.  Deep, rich, and creamy, the truffle carried an beautiful low note that lingered, enticing you to make spread after spread.  \n\nNext came a petit plat de escargot en croute.  Holy butter bandit batman!

The outdoor seating area was packed full as was the restaurant inside (in sharp contrast to its neighbor, Gitane, just down the alley which appeared empty at 7pm). The ambiance was nice - dark, small tables, intimate.\n\nWe ordered a plate of charcuterie, the coq au vin, the bouillabaise, and a side of pomme frites. The waitress seemed very informed when she rattled off wine to pair with our entrees and we went with her suggestions.\n\nThe first red flag was the bread placed on the table. Sliced baguette that was stale. Oh, it's probably a fluke, I chided myself. Slather on some more butter!\n\nOur pathetic plate of charcuterie turned up. An uninspired selection of 3 cuts. Not particularly flavorful, rich, or interesting, served with cornichons, 3 dabs of mustard and 4 slices of bread. For $19. Ouch. Still, I convinced myself that the entrees would be better.\n\nThe wine arrived, huzzah! That excitement fizzled when I tried my \"bold, full bodied white wine\" - it was boring, that kind of bad wine that's been open and sitting around funky. My girlfriend's red was no better. \n\nOn to entrees! My bouillabaise seemed promising - the monk fish was cooked well and the mussels were bouncy perfection. Unfortunately the dish was ruined by being almost unbearably salty. I ate the seafood because I hate to waste food and I think I was still trying to convince myself that it was good. But I could not finish the bouillabaise or the hunk of bread soaking up what should have been delicious broth. For $26 how could it be this bad?? \n\nI hoped the coq au vin would save the day but my girlfriend said it was average at best. I tried a taste - the chicken and sauce were decidedly sour. Not that unctuous sour tartness that results from cooking meat with wine and animal fats but the funkiness that comes from food starting to go bad. Ugh.\n\nEven the pommes frites were ruined from being way too salty!\n\nI regret not speaking up when the waitress hurried by to ask \"how is everything?\" I could only manage to squeak out \"Oh, pretty good...\" when I meant \"it's too salty, it tastes unpleasant...\"\n\nOffered a selection of desserts, I quickly declined any more food from this establishment.\n\nBased on other reviews, this place seems to have a Jekyll and Hyde personality.

Back on topic, we finally got here after drifting about, discussing which streets to turn on and such. A notable restaurant on my bookmark list for a good year and a half, I get to see why so many people enjoy and appreciate this small French Get Away in an SF Alleyway!\n\nGoing inside, it is it dim with splash of bright red and an authentication of location (Euni says this place is as legit as French can be in the Bay Area, go figure). After waiting for several minutes, the waitress sat us down and urged us to order in 10 minutes otherwise we wouldn't be able to order brunch (boo, for lack of compromise). I hate being rushed to order stuff, so it made me a bit disappointed. Looking through the options for a good 5 minutes, here's what we decided to order:\n\nDrinks:\n-Waters all around\n-1 glass of ($15.00 for a glass and $60.00 for a bottle) Lalande De Pomerol  Ch\u00e2teau Haute-Goujon, Bordeaux 2002 \n\nDishes:\n\nSandwiches:\n-1 order of Quiche Lorraine; consists of: pate feuillet\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fraiche, bacon, and egg\n\nEntree's:\n-1 order of Paleron De Flanchet ; consists of:\nflank steak, marchand de vin sauce, served with pommes frites\n\n(I couldn't recall the third entree that my friend Zel ordered but it was also delicious)\n\nDesserts:\n\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e; consists of: 'bourbon' vanilla bean\n-1 order of Sorbet du Jour; selection of Ciao Bella sorbet (plum and mango flavors chosen)\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Coconut Cafe Claude's house flan\n\n\nLet's start with the missing entree, although I wasn't able to recall which one it was. The mysterious green dish escaping my memory banks served its purpose by fulfilling my appetite, probably my more preferred dish to order over my Flat Iron Steak any day of the week. Apologies for the lack of detail on that note.\n\nNext, the Quiche' was decent and size and of course filling for my friend Euni. Although just like my mother, she too has an inability to take a lot of rich food within a short period of time. Therefore, I guess unlike her I can continue enjoying the culinary delights the French can offer at a greater magnitude. Then comes my dish the Paleron De Flanchet, was alright. Tender (as it was served medium, but preferably medium-rare per suggestion of the server) but not enough to satisfy my love for steak. The sauce, was good with the pomme frites, and I decided to decline the use of ketchup.\n\nThe wine, my god for $15.00 I considered it a bit of highway robbery initially. If, Euni didn't mention to me that any wine from Bordeaux was worth the price hike I probably would have cried foul. But no, alas it did its job in pacifying my post-economic recession rage. I was smitten and smothered with the smooth rouge hitting my tongue. No spice, no fuss, all nice (another bottle to add to my ever growing wine collection).\n\nLastly the desserts, the sorbet (consisting of plum and mango) that Euni ordered was splendid. Sorbets not being my thing since the invention of \"Push-Pop creamsicles\" made me appreciate tartness. Then came the coconut flan of Zel's, very creamy. I actually wish my mom and other dessert specialists were to re-create this masterpiece for me personally in the future. And of course, my Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e was outstanding (much better than Shin Sen Gumi's in Fountain Valley, Ca. and Bijou's in Hayward). \n\nSo even with all this good food, why such a mediocre rating? Service...I can't stress that enough. Like Somerset, I felt our table was a bit overshadowed, although our waitress apologized the delay in our receipt and change after paying for the meal ($85.00 altogether with tax and tip). I can't believe their detail in service is lacking. Maybe it's because we came in at a time when they were transitioning shifts from Brunch to Dinner...I'm willing to give them that. But until, I come back for a dinner experience my rating still stands.\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoy what you brought in terms of French cuisine as far as my experience is concern.

I forget exactly whats in this but I believe its rosee with grapefruit and lime juices - packs a nice punch and fizz, especially for an afternoon lunch or brunch.

Cheese plate was only $16 and had huge slices of fabulous cheese.  The Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry was soft, creamy and absolutely, RIDICULOUSLY yummy with a hint of sweetness on the tongue; Pica was very creamy and had a brie-like texture with a nice milky smell, and the Runchon was fabulous with the dates and honey supplied on the plate.  \n\nCroque Madame w/ Pommes Frites & Salad - HOOOOOMG.

Cooked on the outer edges with a good rare on the inside, this steak was yummy though I wish I would have had the Coq au Vin for my main dish. \n\nCoq au Vin - What praise I have for this dish.  Fabulous, hearty, rich and absolutely satisfying any time or place.  Soft, falling off the bone chicken with pearl onions, bacon and a wonderful wine sauce.  Not too salty, not too bland, just perfect!  Loved this; I had to stop myself from stealing it all from a hungry bear! \n\n------------\n\nResult: Me= KO and Cafe Claude = WINS AGAIN!\n\n\nReally though, a fabulous bistro with great atmosphere and better than average service.  We were seated as requested and it is a very cute, romantic restaurant; love the outdoor seating and the windows allow good ventilation though I could see it getting really hot in the summer.  Nice live jazz music and a very comfortable noise level.  \n\nAll in all a four star experience, could get expensive fast, but definitely a cute place to take a loved one or someone special for a nice dinner out.  :)", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-04-29"}, {"excerpts": ["I think the measure of a good french bistro is their fries (pommes frites).

I'm scared, but suddenly there are pretty murals on the walls, maroon overhangs, and some white cloth covered tables. \"Cafe Claude\" doesn't have very good signage, but its the one with the maroon overhang. The green overhang belongs to some Irish Pub.\nI'm still confused, so she sits me down and the waiter brings us the menu. First thing I see is \"Croque Monsieur\". I squeal internally since the waiter is watching me. You see, a few weeks ago, well actually...for a couple weeks, I have been lamenting that I won't be able take my trip to Europe this summer as I had wanted. I was complaining that I wanted French food. And I wanted it now. And my mom brought it to me.\nUmm, can you say amazing?

But anyhow, so I'm having a freaking heart attack of happiness because we pretty much could be in France with the outdoor seating and God help me there are Vespa scooters parked nearby.\nSo we order. Decided to share our courses instead of ordering individual. My choice. Mom took a Lactaid so everything on the menu is free game. Chevre cheese salad to start- chevre goat cheese on toasts, bed of greens tossed in amazing vinaigrette, apple slices, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes. Standard, but come on guys, the cheese was all crispy on the outside and gooey inside. Mouth orgasm number one.\nFor our entree, Porc au Miel. Umm, sweet things and salty things together is my specialty. Tender pork tenderloin ( was that redundant?) in a honey caramel-ish butter sauce with haricots vert and caramelized apple slices. Rich and a generous serving so I'm glad we shared this.....so we could make room for the pommes frites. Umm, fried in duck fat anyone? And served with ketchup AND some spicy mayonnaise looking thing that I have been missing all my life. I really had to pace myself. I really did. Especially since my mom mentioned chocolate cake. Chocolate anything makes me happy, but recently I've been training myself to be a sort of snob. Valhrona or bust, y'all. So I had some high expectations for that chocolate cake....which ended up being a souffle like contraption under the nickname of Moelleux au Chocolat with creme anglaise. This will be the name of my first born child. I'm sorry Bushi Tei Bistro, my souffle de-virginizing at your place was totally not the real thing. This was it.

Nearly a month later, we went back.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of operating structure Cafe Claude works on, but it was kind of chaotic.

Claude Lane is much nicer than Maiden Lane--it's more quaint & there were FAR less flying rats--aka pigeons--so we expected a pleasant lunch.\n\n5 stars for the food.\nPortions are much larger than expected, so you definitely get your money's worth.  We started out with the Rillette du Prigord, which was so rich & delectable.  Next, we each got a sandwich (mine was pork tenderloin & hers was the tuna), both of were very good & came with a side salad.  We also split a side of pommes frites.\n\nI docked a 1/2 star for lukewarm water & no ice in our water glasses.  Nothing makes me enjoy a meal more than drinking a carafe of water that has been baking in the sun.\n\nAnother star docked for the lackluster service.  It started out fine, but towards the end, it was super slow & shoddy.  As the servers were clearing away our dishes, they moved so quickly that they splattered melted butter from the butter dish all over my co-worker.  Not the most pleasant ending to a meal.  If Cafe Claude had great customer service, the server would have taken an item off of our final tab, but that didn't happen.  Also, we had to make several requests to get our check.\n\nOh well, c'est la vie.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-07-19"}, {"excerpts": ["We shared some Pommes Frites (c'est magnifique!), and an heirloom tomato salad with pinenuts which was a unique and nice addition.

", "Perfect seasoned and fried.\n"], "author": "Isaac L.", "review": "Serendipitously profound.\n\nTo start off, we both had randomly selected this restaurant on our own accord.  It's quite amazing that when we touched base that day, we both came up with Cafe Claude.\n\nThe venue itself is tucked away into the many nooks and crannies the FiDi possesses.  If you walk by the alley while on the phone, you'd be sure to miss it.  But once you pass the uninviting pseudo wall blockers, you'd find yourself whisked away into a seemingly another city.  The French speaking Asian lady-owner quickly hosts you to an assortment of tables both inside and out.  We sat outside, heat lamps on.  The atmosphere appears to be frequented by Financial District business people that know the best kept French secret in town.  However, we did sit next to a table of French gangsters with their import cigarettes (they got up and smoked elsewhere like gentlemen),  white pants, no socks, and skinny shirts with the collar wide open.  That actually was a plus to the whole experience.  Just to hear a table of people laughing and speaking French.\n\nOnce inside, the place opens up to 10 or so tables.  A live jazz band is squished into the corner.  A tad loud, but the music selection was smooth and nonabrasive.  An 8 stool bar and a hellava wine list helps to ease the wait.  And on a Saturday night with 8:30PM reservations, I would say it was at full capacity, with patrons still waiting for a table.  The place is quaint but the vaulted ceiling made it feel just right.  Warm low set lights and candles kept the joint hazy and optimal for sharing that nice red.  They boast quite a wine list, but unfortunately, its not online.  The decor is a mix of strategically placed frames and photos - trendy, but not so much where it gets too mind boggling.   Good masculine and feminine balance.\n\nAll servers were French and spoke with a thick French accent - very nice touch.  The service was professional, a bit dry but fair, not too much on the entree suggestion pitch, but overall way above par.\n\nBrochette - $12 black tiger prawn salad with mango, etc.  Yum.  Tasty scrimps.\nTartare de Thon Rouge - $12 raw ahi tuna, goat cheese, quail egg.  tuna was fresh and firm, goat cheese was almost Philadelphia Cream Cheese-ish.  Not a fan of the cream cheese.\nCoq Au Vin  $17 - chicken with red wine sauce, bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions.  very tasty and dense.  chicken was off the bone tender.  sauce was a mild reduction with a very herbal scent.  good stuff.\nAgneau $23 - roasted lamb sirloin - these deli pre-sliced lamb slivers had a lot of taste.  however, the medium rare ordered came out a tad too raw.  The intramuscular fat (marbling) was undercooked giving it a little chewiness and yes, you guessed it, a need for dental floss.  But the sauce was mildly tart and delicious.\nPommes Frites $5 - Must have frites.  Perfect seasoned and fried.\nTarte Tatin  $7 - the upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  eh, actually was disappointed with the inverted apple pie from 7/11.  the apples were overdone and soggy, it looked real dark, and the taste was can-like.

Conveniently located in between the Financial District and Union Square, Caf\u00e9 Claude is hidden on what feels like a Parision alley (Claude Lane).

After asking for water that the busboy had already managed to slip in front of me while I was immersed in the menu, the waiter good naturedly joked with us about their methods of teleportation (needless to say I am a geek and went with a geek).  He was patient and very helpful as we scoured the way too enticing menu.\n\nThe food, which was actually not as over-priced as one might think, was fantastic!  To start, we shared an order of Rillete du Perigord, shredded all-natural duck meat Pate, and Escargot, smothered in yummy butter garlic pesto sauce with cheese on top. Making sure to save room for dessert, for my main dish, I ordered the carrot cr\u00e8me soup with gruyere cheese, which was nicely complimented by the house bread, and stole a few bites of perfectly cooked lamb ...  For dessert, in addition to the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e8e, we shared the Tarte Tatin, an upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.\n\nNeedless to say I was in heaven for what we both considered a belated birthday treat.

"], "author": "Isaac L.", "review": "Serendipitously profound.\n\nTo start off, we both had randomly selected this restaurant on our own accord.  It's quite amazing that when we touched base that day, we both came up with Cafe Claude.\n\nThe venue itself is tucked away into the many nooks and crannies the FiDi possesses.  If you walk by the alley while on the phone, you'd be sure to miss it.  But once you pass the uninviting pseudo wall blockers, you'd find yourself whisked away into a seemingly another city.  The French speaking Asian lady-owner quickly hosts you to an assortment of tables both inside and out.  We sat outside, heat lamps on.  The atmosphere appears to be frequented by Financial District business people that know the best kept French secret in town.  However, we did sit next to a table of French gangsters with their import cigarettes (they got up and smoked elsewhere like gentlemen),  white pants, no socks, and skinny shirts with the collar wide open.  That actually was a plus to the whole experience.  Just to hear a table of people laughing and speaking French.\n\nOnce inside, the place opens up to 10 or so tables.  A live jazz band is squished into the corner.  A tad loud, but the music selection was smooth and nonabrasive.  An 8 stool bar and a hellava wine list helps to ease the wait.  And on a Saturday night with 8:30PM reservations, I would say it was at full capacity, with patrons still waiting for a table.  The place is quaint but the vaulted ceiling made it feel just right.  Warm low set lights and candles kept the joint hazy and optimal for sharing that nice red.  They boast quite a wine list, but unfortunately, its not online.  The decor is a mix of strategically placed frames and photos - trendy, but not so much where it gets too mind boggling.   Good masculine and feminine balance.\n\nAll servers were French and spoke with a thick French accent - very nice touch.  The service was professional, a bit dry but fair, not too much on the entree suggestion pitch, but overall way above par.\n\nBrochette - $12 black tiger prawn salad with mango, etc.  Yum.  Tasty scrimps.\nTartare de Thon Rouge - $12 raw ahi tuna, goat cheese, quail egg.  tuna was fresh and firm, goat cheese was almost Philadelphia Cream Cheese-ish.  Not a fan of the cream cheese.\nCoq Au Vin  $17 - chicken with red wine sauce, bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions.  very tasty and dense.  chicken was off the bone tender.  sauce was a mild reduction with a very herbal scent.  good stuff.\nAgneau $23 - roasted lamb sirloin - these deli pre-sliced lamb slivers had a lot of taste.  however, the medium rare ordered came out a tad too raw.  The intramuscular fat (marbling) was undercooked giving it a little chewiness and yes, you guessed it, a need for dental floss.  But the sauce was mildly tart and delicious.\nPommes Frites $5 - Must have frites.  Perfect seasoned and fried.\nTarte Tatin  $7 - the upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  eh, actually was disappointed with the inverted apple pie from 7/11.  the apples were overdone and soggy, it looked real dark, and the taste was can-like.   Pass.\n\nOverall, the experience est bonne.  You still get that city-feel with the sounds of blaring of taxicab horns without all the visuals.  You really do feel transported to a private French cafe.  There are no other restaurants in that alley, so it has that exclusive feel.  Our server let us dine for hours, without interruption or hint-dropping.  Definitely a great place to intimately share a great meal, tap a bottle of wine, and ultimately create long lasting memories.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-09-26"}, {"excerpts": ["For afters we had the tarte tatin and a chocolate cake.

A little piece of Paris for the hefty price of San Francisco - a little food staycation for those that want more than food... like jam (no, not the fruity jar-ed kind - the melodic kind). I like that this restaurant integrates a musical live jazz experience with the romantic French prose of food - the escargot; the wine; the French onion soup; the chocolate soft cake.  It is an experience for the taste buds - and for the ear buds over a most memorable experience with your best buds (the human ones).  \n\nIt is nice that the people running the restaurant are  from France, and are very helpful and kind in making recommendations and providing decent service (though it could have been a bit more efficient). \n\nWhat dishes did I enjoy?\n\n(1) The escargots en croute.  I liked the buttery, garlic and parsley infused reduction with shallots and anchovy - and how the escargot were baked in like delicate swirled angels sleeping in a puff pastry blanket.  \n\n(2) My favorite dish was the french onion soup (soup a l'oignon). And is the oignON spot ON. My only constructive criticism about this dish is that I wish it were less salty. However, the onion soup gratinee had a most beautiful red wine aftertaste that married well with the melting emMENTAL cheese that is a mental wonderland. The baguette crouton was sliced in the perfect thickness to create a golden ratio of onion soup. \n\n(3) Actually - I take that back. My actual favorite dish was the dessert. The Moelleux au Chocolat was in fact my favorite dish here.  The soft chocolate cake was not too sweet - which I appreciated as the bitterness of the chocolate was able to come through to surface in its natural roughness. The Creme Anglaise vanilla sauce was poured in, melding in with the chocolate to form a chocolate-creme anglaise combination that was black and white harmony at its most intimate peak. \n\nWhat dishes could have used perhaps a little more thoughtfulness?\n\n(A) The Casserole de Champignon. The ingredients were great - the farro verde, the king trumpet mushrooms, the carrots, the broccolini and kale.  I just wish there were more flavor other than butter. And I wish that there was more to it. I am a person who appreciates simplicity when it comes to good food - but there is simplicity done thoughtfully and tastefully and simplicity done in the other direction. I am afraid this fell in the latter category. \n\n(B) Confit de Canard. The duck was crisp, but it came at the expense of moisture, for I have never eaten such a dry piece of duck in my life. I was also a bit disappointed at the portion size. I did appreciate the warm puy lentils and the fris\u00e9e; and I enjoyed the flavor of course mustard against the duck.  \n\nCafe Claude, I applaude that you share a little piece of France - and beautiful live music with it - in the oft busy SF life.

If so, you unfortunately don't have many options in French restaurants except the sides maybe.\n\nI had the salmon served medium rare. That's how I like my salmon. It was a little bit more than medium rare but still moist and good. The potatoes served on the side were again very average & some were undercooked.

It is located in an ally along with several other eating establishments.  We  made a reservations (which I recommend) via Open Table and that went without a hitch.  The restaurant is lovely and they have a very nice bar area with live music.  Tables are far enough apart so that you have some privacy to enjoy your dinner.\n\nThe staff was excellent.  Helpful, friendly, attentive and all around just great.  I want to point out something here.  I had ordered a second drink mid meal and the staff got busy with another table.  I'm not sure if it was the owner, hostess or someone else but they were watching and a few seconds later out comes a drink.  This is just great service and to me, shows that they really care about the experience and their customers.\n\nThe food:  Excellent!  Onion soup was very good and prepared so that there was just enough baked cheese to enjoy but not so much that it was  problematic to eat.  We went with the Coq Au Vin and it was delicious.\n\nFor dessert I went for the Moelleux Au Chocolat. Awesome!\n\nWas it expensive?  I don't  think so for what I received and the experience I walked away with.  I have been to so called brew pubs in SF and paid more and it was not 1/2 the food or experience.\n\nThis was a great experience and I would go back - and will.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["For dessert we all ordered the moelleux au chocolat.

Go there yourself, taste the food, drink the wine, listen to the jazz, enjoy the friendly service, and don't forget the zinc bar.  I'm sure you'll find multiple reasons to love Cafe Claude.\n\nIf you like wines, check out their selection of French reds.  I especially recommend their choice of Bordeaux wines from Saint-Emilion and Pomerol.  Not to be outdone, they have a killer selection of wines from Burgundy and Rhone.  You can never go wrong asking for a recommendation from their experienced and knowledgeable servers.\n\nSome snapshots of my favorite moments at Cafe Claude:\n\nSeptember 2003:   The first time I tried the Bavette Sauce Poivre Vert at Cafe Claude.  They cook it exactly the way I like.  I'm hooked.\n\nBastille Day 2006.  Claude Lane was jam-packed.  Marcus Shelby Trio was playing.  I was waived past the security guards and found a place at the bar.  Probably the best jazz and wine pairing I've ever experienced.\n\nSeptember 2006:  Best first date of my life.   I order her the Moelleux au Chocolat.  Her eyes roll back in her head and she almost has an orgasm in the restaurant.

The ambiance was very warm and intimate, and live jazzy music started about halfway through our meal.\nWe shared the escargots to start. The snails were deliciously drowning in garlic-parsley butter, with little \"croute\" hats on top. I wish there had been more than six - very tasty!\nIt took us a while to figure out what entrees to order as both colleagues are limited eaters at the moment (one is gluten-free) and the server was a little fussy about substitutions. Which in a small kitchen on a busy Friday night, I suppose I can understand. \nBeing delightfully food issue-free, I immediately went for the pan-roasted salmon, which turned out to be a good idea. The seared-to-medium fillet was perched atop French lentils with bacon, and dressed with a tangy horseradish cream. The dish was rich enough to stand up to the bottle of Cotes du Rhone that we shared.\nI stole a few bites of the white bean and artichoke ragout from the lamb plate, but was unimpressed. My favorite entree turned out to be my friend's trout aux amandes - perfectly cooked trout was slathered in lightly toasted almonds and a white wine lemon sauce (that inexplicably contained mushrooms?). The green beans were somewhat uninspired but the butter-drenched fingerling potatoes were very good, as butter-drenched items tend to be. \nI also had a bite of the moelleux au chocolat, which was soft and chocolaty good.\n\nThe special was described as a blue-nose sea bass and it sounded really good, but it was 29 bucks! My salmon was only 19, and I just can't see another fish entree as worth those extra 10 bucks.

The green overhang belongs to some Irish Pub.\nI'm still confused, so she sits me down and the waiter brings us the menu. First thing I see is \"Croque Monsieur\".

Decided to share our courses instead of ordering individual. My choice. Mom took a Lactaid so everything on the menu is free game. Chevre cheese salad to start- chevre goat cheese on toasts, bed of greens tossed in amazing vinaigrette, apple slices, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes. Standard, but come on guys, the cheese was all crispy on the outside and gooey inside. Mouth orgasm number one.\nFor our entree, Porc au Miel. Umm, sweet things and salty things together is my specialty. Tender pork tenderloin ( was that redundant?) in a honey caramel-ish butter sauce with haricots vert and caramelized apple slices. Rich and a generous serving so I'm glad we shared this.....so we could make room for the pommes frites. Umm, fried in duck fat anyone? And served with ketchup AND some spicy mayonnaise looking thing that I have been missing all my life. I really had to pace myself. I really did. Especially since my mom mentioned chocolate cake.

Then only reason we didn't want to wipe it clean was because we wanted to save room in our bellies!\n\nI then ordered the pork with gratin on the side and my husband ordered steak with fries and the gratin as well, being that it is one of our favorites side dishes. For dessert, we shared the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e and it was very scrumptious. Everything was very high quality. The pork was a bit undercooked for my taste but even if, I ate every last bite. I had a bite of my husband's steak and the sauce was just right, not too rich not too bland. Our waiter was french and spoke french to us and english to our vegetarian friends. (We'll make it a habit not to bring them along with us next time we go to a french restaurant being that two of them only ordered fries and a salad, this resto is not vegan friendly). Anyway, we always enjoy it when we can have a nice convo in french with our waiter without the parisian attitude. The location is alright. I had to park in the garage nearby but it wasn't too pricey. The staff was also very professional and kept their cool even if the noise made it hard to hear. \n\nThe down side was that the decor was a bit average. Not at all tacky just boring and predictable. Having worked near la tour eiffel and seeing it daily, I'm sick of seeing it plastered everywhere outside of France. I know it is the symbol of France but there is much more to France than the tower and I think for those who have never been, it would definitely be appreciated if those best kept secrets were to be shared. Anyway, I feel that they could have been more creative with that. It's quite noticeable because the place is a bit small (to no fault of their own) and (I don't know if it was because of Bastille Day but it was crowded. I guess for all these reasons it didn't give you much of the desire to want to hang around longer than you needed to). \n\nI will sum it up by saying my husband and I both agreed that despite the price for the wine and being just a bit jipped for the price for the food in comparison to what you could find in a little brasserie tucked away in Paris for a more reasonable price, we'll take into consideration that this SF and say we're definitely coming back and are sure to be regulars (ou bien, pour ceux qui parlent fran\u00e7ais: les habitu\u00e9s) ! \n\nau fait, c'est dommage que les prix sont un peu chers, on aimerait bien y aller plus souvent.. !", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-07-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Dessert:\nCr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e (5/5) - Simply unreal.

"], "author": "Ryan M.", "review": "I met up with Euni and Zel as one last rendezvous for food and good company before they headed back down to SoCal before I did.  Coming out of the Montgomery BART station, reminded me of why Skid Row remained \"Skidded out.\"\n\nCheap Chinese Food, Crackheads screaming out obscenities, and your fashionable Hipster Business Consultant all on the same block, go figure. Back on topic, we finally got here after drifting about, discussing which streets to turn on and such. A notable restaurant on my bookmark list for a good year and a half, I get to see why so many people enjoy and appreciate this small French Get Away in an SF Alleyway!\n\nGoing inside, it is it dim with splash of bright red and an authentication of location (Euni says this place is as legit as French can be in the Bay Area, go figure). After waiting for several minutes, the waitress sat us down and urged us to order in 10 minutes otherwise we wouldn't be able to order brunch (boo, for lack of compromise). I hate being rushed to order stuff, so it made me a bit disappointed. Looking through the options for a good 5 minutes, here's what we decided to order:\n\nDrinks:\n-Waters all around\n-1 glass of ($15.00 for a glass and $60.00 for a bottle) Lalande De Pomerol  Ch\u00e2teau Haute-Goujon, Bordeaux 2002 \n\nDishes:\n\nSandwiches:\n-1 order of Quiche Lorraine; consists of: pate feuillet\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fraiche, bacon, and egg\n\nEntree's:\n-1 order of Paleron De Flanchet ; consists of:\nflank steak, marchand de vin sauce, served with pommes frites\n\n(I couldn't recall the third entree that my friend Zel ordered but it was also delicious)\n\nDesserts:\n\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e; consists of: 'bourbon' vanilla bean\n-1 order of Sorbet du Jour; selection of Ciao Bella sorbet (plum and mango flavors chosen)\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Coconut Cafe Claude's house flan\n\n\nLet's start with the missing entree, although I wasn't able to recall which one it was. The mysterious green dish escaping my memory banks served its purpose by fulfilling my appetite, probably my more preferred dish to order over my Flat Iron Steak any day of the week. Apologies for the lack of detail on that note.\n\nNext, the Quiche' was decent and size and of course filling for my friend Euni. Although just like my mother, she too has an inability to take a lot of rich food within a short period of time. Therefore, I guess unlike her I can continue enjoying the culinary delights the French can offer at a greater magnitude. Then comes my dish the Paleron De Flanchet, was alright. Tender (as it was served medium, but preferably medium-rare per suggestion of the server) but not enough to satisfy my love for steak. The sauce, was good with the pomme frites, and I decided to decline the use of ketchup.\n\nThe wine, my god for $15.00 I considered it a bit of highway robbery initially. If, Euni didn't mention to me that any wine from Bordeaux was worth the price hike I probably would have cried foul. But no, alas it did its job in pacifying my post-economic recession rage. I was smitten and smothered with the smooth rouge hitting my tongue. No spice, no fuss, all nice (another bottle to add to my ever growing wine collection).\n\nLastly the desserts, the sorbet (consisting of plum and mango) that Euni ordered was splendid. Sorbets not being my thing since the invention of \"Push-Pop creamsicles\" made me appreciate tartness. Then came the coconut flan of Zel's, very creamy. I actually wish my mom and other dessert specialists were to re-create this masterpiece for me personally in the future. And of course, my Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e was outstanding (much better than Shin Sen Gumi's in Fountain Valley, Ca. and Bijou's in Hayward). \n\nSo even with all this good food, why such a mediocre rating? Service...I can't stress that enough. Like Somerset, I felt our table was a bit overshadowed, although our waitress apologized the delay in our receipt and change after paying for the meal ($85.00 altogether with tax and tip). I can't believe their detail in service is lacking. Maybe it's because we came in at a time when they were transitioning shifts from Brunch to Dinner...I'm willing to give them that. But until, I come back for a dinner experience my rating still stands.\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoy what you brought in terms of French cuisine as far as my experience is concern. I'm definitely willing to give this place a shot again, and maybe with another Lalande De Pomerol on hand.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-12-30"}, {"excerpts": ["*\n\n- Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e $7.\nmade with 'bourbon' vanilla bean\n"], "author": "Heidi C.", "review": "Why am I giving this place 3?

It gave the impression of some sort of comfort food, but didn't meet my expectations. It lacked strong \"comfort\" taste, but my honey liked it so maybe it was just me.

She didn't look very friendly, so I got the BITCH vibe from her. Her name is SOPHIE. I did NOT like this SOPHIE girl a bit. As we were finishing up our bowl of bread and butter (which was also very tasty), our pate plate came out... without any kind of crackers or bread of some sort... I don't know about you, but I can't eat pate but itself. So my honey asked her for more bread and she said that it will take a few minutes because they had to get more. OK understandable, no rush. As we waited with the last of our first batch of bread, she walked by and for no reason said to my honey something along the lines of \"I'll get you your bread, you don't have to be so stingy about it\".... WTF??? are you flippin' serious?? How do you say THAT to a customer? That TOTALLY ruined the mood. What could've possibly made her say something like that? I have NO idea. Oh and everytime we said \"Thank You\" to her, she NEVER EVER said \"You're Welcome\". WHAT IN THE FREAKIN HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?\n\nAs we finished up the pate, we left the last pate behind because it wasn't our favorite one. She comes back and is VERY adamant about us finishing the last pate. FIRST, she suggested adding some salt and pepper to it... So I did and we tried it after she left our table. Still didn't like it. She came back and was ATTEMPTING to suggest something about the salt grinder, which had NO point. Something about the salt crystals being so huge and she even OPENED up the grinder to show us.... I'M SORRY, BUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE POINT IN THAT? There WAS no point. You have just wasted a good few minutes of mine and my boyfriend's dinner time together to talk about your DAMN SALT GRINDER.\n\nYou don't freakin push a customer to finish something if they don't want to. I did not like her A BIT.\n\nI left 15% tip anyways because of the food.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCome here. This place is pretty good.

I will forever and always dote on French cuisine just as much as I dote on French art such as that of my Claude Monet.  So, it was quite fitting when my fianc\u00e9 I found ourselves seated at a fantastic cafe named after my favorite artist (not saying that Claude Monet actually inspired the naming of this restaurant).\n\nThe presence of live jazz music made up for the lack of lily pads, but the music-induced ambience sure made me feel as if I was enjoying myself in little old Giverny.  The music filled the entire interior and exterior space, and as my fianc\u00e9 and I were sat outside we enjoyed the lovely weather in addition to the fantastic music.  I believe that the live jazz music only occurs on Thursday nights (though I could be wrong)...if I'm not wrong, you should plan a date night here on Thursday's!  Even were you to come on any other night, Cafe Claude is brilliant choice for date night, especially if you do opt to sit outside (given it is warm enough - but don't worry, there's heated lamps).  Sitting outside gives the sense that you're in a Parisian alley, enjoying all the luxuries of life.\n\nAll this and I haven't even gotten to the food.  Though everything else makes the trip to Cafe Claude worth it, the cuisine is the star.  We ordered the escargot to begin with, and that's a must as this escargot is topped with some beyond good pastry substance.  Then we got the croquet madame, charcuterie board, and the French onion soup for splitting.  This was the second best croquet madame I have had (the very best being in Paris) because of how perfectly balanced and rich every ingredient was.  The French onion soup was also in the top 5 best that I've had - and this soup was huge!  So that was all savory and delicious, but we ended on a high note by getting the chocolate cake souffl\u00e9 which was just as good as those you would get in France.

Finally had to ask that font of all wisdom, my phone.\n\nI had requested outdoor seating. At first I was on a table right under a heater, but after the run felt too hot. The very nice waiter moved me, but within a few minutes I felt cold, as the outdoor area is in shade & wind. I did not want to ask to be moved again, so figured I'd just manage. Maybe next time come early when it's not crowded & sit indoors.\n\nOK, food! I got the Sparkles in the Sky, Salade de Chevre Chaud, Confit de Canard, and Creme Brulee. A bit of confusion over water, asked if I wanted water I said yes, then another person said do I want still or sparkling, I said sparkling. Ended up with a glass of regular water and a carafe of sparkling.\n\nBasically - everything was good. Cocktail, very good, slightly sweet but not overwhelming, mild enough so it did not knock me over, very pretty shade of lavender! Salad, excellent, don't know what they put in dressing but it was really good, loved the pecans. Goat cheese spread on brioche croutons. Practically a meal, in fact, pretty close to what I eat for lunch when I prepare my own, although fancier. Loved duck; when I see duck on a menu I rarely order anything else. The duck was falling off bone, crisp skin, not at all fatty. Liked the lentils and big pieces of bacon (is that what they were? A smoked pork of some kind). The creme brulee had a good thin crust, and was rich and creamy, although a tad lacking in vanilla flavor.\n\nI ordered a pot of tea to have with entree. Next mishap. The hot water comes in a metal pot and it's heavy (tempted to say Heavy Metal!). The pot has a narrow base and flared sides, so it's not just heavy, it's top heavy. The ground outside is not level and the pot toppled right over, spilling hot water everywhere. Fortunately it did not get in my food or on me, but my two magazines got very wet. I later had to carefully unstick the pages. The waiter very promptly and without being asked came to the rescue, moved everything to a new table. So I got quite the table tour at Cafe Claude! \n\nI would like to return some time, try the onion soup and one of the fish entrees or maybe just make a meal of salad and charcuterie.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-10-30"}], "solace": [{"excerpts": ["- Solace - Get this! "], "author": "Keizzel C.", "review": "After studying abroad and visiting France I was dying to find a french gem in Fidi. After looking on opentable I thought this place would be a great spot to check out. We had a reservation for lunch at 2:30PM but after running late from another event they were more than willing to change it to 2:45PM. Thank you for that! \n\nThis location is in an alley so don't expect to be finding on the street casually walking by. I actually like that since it's hidden from all the crowds and to me makes it a little more special. Once you come up to the place you realize that there is an outside area and a small indoor area. The place has a black mirror wall that really expands the place and you realize how small it is. Bathrooms are also through the back door & shared I believe. \n\nWHAT WE GOT: \n\n- Escargot - Not my fave. The puff pastry was a nice touch but I thought it tasted better with the bread vs the escargot itself. \n\n- Steak & Fries - I asked for it rare and it came pretty done. The steak wasn't cooked evenly and while I was excited about the bone marrow butter, I thought the taste steak/meat was covered by the gravy they added on top. The french fries were super crispy though which I enjoyed.\n\n- Crispy Duck - The crispy duck was perfectly crisp on the outside while staying juicy on the inside. I wish there were other sides vs. what it came with since it felt like something was lacking.\n\n- Solace - Get this! If you're a fan of gin and want something refreshing this is a great option. \n\nOverall, the service was OK. The waitress was sure to make sure she was available when we ordered and asked for the check, but aside from that it felt hands off. TBH it was nice spot to check out but I don't think the food/portions warranted the high prices.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-10-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Next time I'm trying the SOLACE per the waitress' recommendation.\n\n"], "author": "Jessica L.", "review": "Great atmosphere. It is the perfect amount of romantic, classy, but comfortable. This place is like a more intimate version of Balthazar in New York, but the food here is more traditional french cuisine.\n\nSTEAK TARTARE appetizer is delicious. The waitress brings a little cart near your table and mixes the ingredients in front of you. \n\nTRUITE AMANDINE was such a great choice and prepared to perfection. The fish was moist on the inside and  had a crispy outside. But, I do think that this dish is only good for someone that likes lemony capery flavors. Don't get this is you don't like those flavors because you will probably HATE the dish.\n\nCOQ AU VIN is amazing. The chicken was fall off the bone tender, and the wine sauce was strong and thick, and the flavors were nicely absorbed into the chicken and vegetables. \n\nFRENCH MARTINI was really good, very sweet drink. Next time I'm trying the SOLACE per the waitress' recommendation.\n\nService is great too, and I would definitely come back to try the other options on their menu!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-19"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Solace, which is totally a disaster....", "it's a mix of cucumber vodka, ginger liquor and fresh lime juice, got a really weird bitter and sour flavor.

For another drink, Hummingbird, despite its fancy name, its just Mojito without mint leaf. \n\nThe food part was a pleasure experience.\nTo start, we had Escargots and Charcuterie. the Escargots are great, goes perfect with the puff pastry. \n\nFor entree, we went for Lamb shank and Pan roasted ling cod. The Lamb Shank is a special menu for that day, nicely flavored and well cooked, I would come back for this again. The cod is only ok, good fresh fish but the flavor is too plain. In addition, we got creamy salted spinach as a side and it turned out to be one of the smartest choice! \n\nTo finish, we ordered creme brulee and moelleux au chocolat. The creme brulee definitely made the night, it's just the perfect way a creme brulee should be, crispy at the top, soft and creamy in the center, not too sweet, but makes a great touch. Moelieux au chocolat is a thick soft chocolate cake, i personally feel it too heavy and too sweet.\n\nOverall, I will come back to this place again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered a Solace from the bar because I wanted to try cucmber vodka which went from interesting to blah by the end of the drink.
