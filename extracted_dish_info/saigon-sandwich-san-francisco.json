Most of their sandwiches are under $4, which is a great price compared to a lot of banh mi places in the city, and an especially great price for a sandwich nowadays. Bummer that they don't accept cards. Cash-only is inconvenient, but for $4, I guess I can't complain too much.\n\nOn a weekday afternoon, I picked up a Thit - Roast Pork Sandwich, and a Thit Cha Pate - Special Combination w/ pate, roast pork, ham, both of which were topped with pickled carrots & daikon, jalapenos, and lots of cilantro. The French baguette was lightly toasted and crunchy. There was a good amount of meat and pate. I could distinctly taste the sweet and savory flavors of the pork, as well as the pate, unlike some banh mi that just have a light smear of pate and the flavor fades into the background. If I could change one thing, I'd use less cilantro, or at least take the leaves off the stalks, so the celery-like texture doesn't interfere with the sandwich.\n\nI don't usually factor in location, since good food is good food, no matter where you are, but you're pretty likely to run into some people on the street who are not all there. You know, people who are talking to themselves, or going off on an incoherent rant, or who seem to be yelling at you, at themselves, or no one in particular. \n\nLuckily, I didn't have to deal with their weekend lines. There were only a couple of people ahead of me. The space is no larger than a takeout counter, so when a line accumulates, it can easily go out the door. \nIf you're in the area and there isn't a long line, and in need of an inexpensive & satisfying banh mi on the go, Saigon is great for that. However, if there is a line, the sandwiches are not a must have. In fact, there are quite a few other banh mi joints nearby that are a pretty decent substitute as well.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Try the combination (Thit Cha Pate) for  $4.75."], "author": "Andrew F.", "review": "All the other reviews raving about this place are true.
