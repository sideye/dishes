Our group was the majority of their Friday lunch crowd, except for a group of 2 and a solo guy.\n\nSituation: I am allergic to bread/gluten. When the waitress took my order for a Kabob Soltani I specifically asked, \"Does this come on bread? I can't eat bread\". She replied that they could swap the rice for salad, do 50/50 rice/salad, etc. I ordered the kabob w/rice.\n\nSome time later, the Kabob Soltani came out on a bed of lavash bread. I brought this up to the waitress and she claimed that I'd never said anything about my allergy. My coworkers and I were adamant that I had in fact asked for \"no bread\".\n\nTHEIR RESPONSE: Here's the thing - Mistakes happen. As someone with a food allergy, I've been in situations where I have forgotten to mention my intolerance. I've also been in situations like today where the restaurant messed up. It's fine. I'm used to it. What's telling is how the restaurant staff handles the situation. \n\nThe way it was handled by the waitress and manager is that they falsely and repeatedly accused me of not mentioning the bread allergy. Additionally, they said that I could either eat the kabob as-is, or I could pay for a new plate. Why would I eat the kabob that's been laying in bread if I am allergic to bread? Why would I pay for a second plate? In the 7 years that I've been intolerant of bread, this is the first time that a restaurant has asked me to pay to re-make the food -- even counting times where it was my own fault!!\n\nWhat really topped this off was the awful attitude of the staff. From that moment till we left, they were really bitchy towards us. No politeness. No hospitality. No thank you or goodbyes. Just dirty looks and sh|%%y attitude.\n\n\nOther feedback on the food: \n* The tadig appetizer was a \"D\". Not very crispy or crunchy.\n* The khoreshts for the tadig (ghormeh sabzee and ghaymeh) were both so-so.\n* When the Mirza Ghasemi appetizer came out, one of my coworkers joked that it was mostly tomato paste with a touch of eggplant. Subpar.\n\n\nBetween the mediocre food and the awful customer service, I am never going back here and I would not be surprised if this place is closed within a year.

His aunt took him here a few times and he said it's probably the most authentic Persian food in the city.  We love it. \n\nWe first started with glasses of wine.  They gave us free samples to decide which wine and then a very heavy pour.  A great start.  ;-).  We did family style\n\nMy favorites were the following.  5 stars \n- Anar salad.  Fresh and delicious.   I got it light on the dressing which was perfect.  Loved the combo of broccoli and walnut with the red lettuce \n- ground lamb - omg this was so delicious.  We had to order a second one.   This is probably my favorite kebab of all time. So tender and flavorful but not greasy at all\n- half and Half dessert.  The ice cream and vermicelli in rose water.  It's the last one on the dessert menu.  Omg.  I must come back for that and I am not even a dessert person. \n\nThe other stuff we ordered were just okay. I wasn't big fans of the crispy rice appetizer. It seems stale to me.  The stew were authentic according to our friend but an acquired taste. We had the chicken and beef.  Both were unique both not my favorite. \n\nOverall, a great experience in an unexpected part of town.  We drive by all the time and never noticed this restaurant.

I don't know how to say that in Farsi, but I'm in Sunday's San Francisco Chonicle (http://bit.ly/1pQgJQ8). Based on their suggestion, this is the place where they photographed me for the article because I had a nice dining experience here the week before, and fortunately I was able to get the same high quality of Persian food this time. I first noticed this place when I was taking the MUNI 12-line but really got motivated to try it when a friend of Jamie W.'s and a fellow Yelper, wrote that it was the \"BEST Persian food in SF right now\" (armand d. - here's his helpful review: http://bit.ly/XvIvuz). That was enough of an endorsement for me, so Jamie and I gave it a go last week.\n\nWell, it's not in a great location unless, I assume, you happen to be coming at... I mean coming to Blow Buddies or the End Up. It's on the speedway block of Harrison between 5th and 6th where all the Bay Bridge traffic pours into the city. Once you enter, it's a modestly decorated place, and you are greeted by one or both of the lovely young women who manage the front of the house. Persian cuisine is not well represented in the city, which is a shame since it has a lot in common with Turkish, Greek and Indian food. Most everything sounded tempting on the menu, so we started with the $7 plate of Dolmeh (Leaf), similar to Greek dolmas in the use of ground beef, rice and grape leaves but different in the use of split peas, herbs and a pomegranate seed garnish (photo: http://bit.ly/1shV47d). Delicious mouthfuls. We then shared two entrees.\n\nThe first was the $15 Loobia-Polo, a basmati saffron rice plate with chunks of beef, green beans and all sorts of spices (photo: http://bit.ly/1AMZ2JU). The second was our favorite, the $12 Kabab Koobideh, savory skewers of Persian minced meat kabab made from ground lamb and beef mixed with saffron seasoning, parsley, and chopped onions. It comes with lots of rice which put us on official grain overload (photo: http://bit.ly/1s0ZLB6). The last dish was actually an accident. It was the $12 Dolmeh (Belly Pepper) (photo: http://bit.ly/1pRyLl2) which the server had thought was the other dolmeh dish. When we pointed out that this was the one we wanted, she immediately had the chef make one for us free of charge even though we naively thought the first dolmeh leaves were complimentary. The belly pepper turned out to be a better stuffed vegetable, but by that point, we were completely stuffed.\n\nI was so pleased with the home-style dishes that when the Chronicle asked me to identify a place to be photographed for their story on Yelp Elites, I told them to meet me there the following Wednesday. With my friend Stephanie, we ordered the $6 Naan Panir Sabzi, a cornucopia of pita with fresh scallions, mint and basil leaves and blocks of feta cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/UKxPX6), but the highlight turned out to be the $17 Fesenjan, a chicken stew with ground walnut in a sweet-and-sour pomegranate sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1qT65hV). It was like a Persian version of butter chicken. I even tried a $3 glass of Doogh, a salty yogurt-based drink that I just couldn't warm up to.

This is one skewer of marinated steak (barg), one skewer of ground beef and lamb (koobideh), and rice. All three were fantastic. I'm typically not a huge fan of koobideh, but they have spiced theirs perfectly. \n\n(2) Joojeh Kabob. This is one skewer of grilled chicken with rice. Again, excellent flavor and texture.\n\n(3) Fesenjan. This is a great dish that many non-Iranians probably don't know about. It is chicken and rice with a sauce made from crushed walnuts and pomegranate syrup. It is a sweeter-tasting dish, and I highly recommend this to people who haven't had it before. \n\nMy only suggestions on improvements would be:\n\n(1) Maybe keep the water bottles in the refrigerator. My table went through two bottles of water and both were room temperature. Or I could've just asked for ice...\n\n(2) Our entrees came out just a few minutes after the appetizer was brought out.

I have mixed feelings about Anar Restaurant, as some of the Persian home-style food was really good like the spinach yogurt (mast-o esfenaj), but the chicken (joojeh) kabob was a little dry. \n\nThe menu is small, with very few vegetarian options. I mentioned to the young waitress about the lack of vegetarian main dish options and she reacted as if she had never heard of this being an issue, which is ridiculous since we are in San Francisco. She also did not offer any substitutions for the vegetarian diner. The day we came to Anar there was nothing unusual about the menu offerings, it's mostly the same dishes as the other Persian restaurants in San Francisco including; Lavash, Alborz and Maykadeh but with less menu choices. It was unclear if their menu changes periodically?\n\nI ordered tea, but only given one 1/2 size sugar cube. My dining partner ordered bread, only a very small amount of bread given with one butter. It felt like everything was being measured, cutting corners and considering price over dining comfort.\n\nOur waitress is not formally trained in waiting tables, as it was made obvious that she is related to someone that works/owns the business. This is really sweet that it is a family business, but it also means that they are not professional. The decor is homey, looks like someone in the family tried to help decorate.
