Quite traditional decor, very dimly-lit, sharply-dressed servers. From the bar side of Harris, we could hear live music being played and sung, which was a nice touch. The first thing that was brought out to us was drinks menus. I wasn't interested, so I waited and waited and waited until the dinner menus were finally brought out. (As you can tell, I was not a fan of not being able to agonize over what I was going to eat for so long.)\n\nAfter we ordered food, each person was given one delicious roll of bread - just one? with all that butter? Ooookay. My boyfriend and I split the 24 oz. porterhouse and sprung to try it with the seared foie gras.

Not great, which is what I was expecting at this price point, but fine. The flavor was... fine. And the doneness and texture were... fine. But I didn't want to finish it.

I'm not sure what happened here, as it looked fantastic and smelled amazing, but something was just a little bit off.

Again, it was just fine, and we wound up not finishing it.\n\nAlso, this might sound trivial, but at past visits to nice steakhouses, I've experienced a more friendly level of service? At Harris, I often felt like the servers were a bit annoyed with us and weren't particularly warm.

The black truffle cabernet sauce was complex and had depth of flavor to it; adding that a layer of earthiness with a tangy rich sweetness that set this dish over the top! \n\n*SIDES: Our entrees came with a choice of a Baked Potato or Cheese Scalloped Potatoes. \n\n--BAKED POTATO: OK! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=UCfw-bRQf84F1fJcp9ZhRw \nIt was just a plain baked potato you can get at any chain restaurant like Sizzler's or Red Lobster. \n\n--CHEESE SCALLOPED POTATOES: GOOD! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=4r10-Sw5q6yxaHA0LiNXFQ\nThe slices of potatoes were stacked and then topped with cheese.

The lemon ice cream was refreshingly tart with a hint of sweetness while the sponge cake was rich and buttery, but light. The combo of all three created contrasting warm/cold temperatures, crisp, smooth, and soft textures with sweet, creamy and refreshing citrus flavors. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nProfessional and attentive but pretentious.

I like the clubby old-school steakhouse look, but at least they don't go overboard with it so it doesn't look too stuffy.  We had reservations for 7:30 but arrived around 15min earlier, but they seated us right away anyway.\n\nHubby got one of their \"King Eider\" martinis for his ap\u00e9ritif and it looked pretty cool.  They serve it in a small-ish martini glass but they give you a tiny carafe in a little ice bucket for the rest of it...this is pretty nice, especially for people who like to nurse their drinks since it guarantees that your martini is always perfectly chilled even though it's a large portion.  I only had a small sip since I was DD for the night and it tasted really good too.\n\nFor our appetizers, we started off with the oysters and the sweetbreads.  The oysters tasted really fresh, and came 6 oysters and 3 different sauces...they were all good but I like the mignonette sauce the best.  The sweetbreads were even better, we got a pretty large portion (3 pieces) and they were seared with a nice sauce.  They were cooked perfectly and I gotta say a lot better than what I've had at some French restaurants! \n\nFor our main course, I had the filet mignon rossini and hubby got the ribeye.  My filet was cooked perfectly medium-rare, and they gave a really generous portion of nicely seared foie gras on top.  It came with a really nice red wine sauce, though I couldn't really taste the truffle that was supposed to be in the sauce.  I'm not a big potato person, but I LOVED the scalloped potatoes that came with my steak...it kinda tasted like mac&cheese but with potatoes instead of the mac.  Very yummy.  Hubby's ribeye was also really good, it had those nice little pockets of fat that ribeye steaks do, and had some nice beefy flavor from the dry-aging.  We had some mushrooms on ths side, which I thought was a little too peppery but the hubby liked it.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate cake and hubby had some sort of fruit crisp.  They were both kinda meh, but then I didn't really have great expectations at this sort of place anyway.  It satisfied the urge to have something sweet at the end of our meal, that's all.\n\nFrom looking at the website, I was kinda scared that they wouldn't have much of a wine selection, since it only indicated their banquet wine list which wasn't much.  However the wine list they have at the restaurant was much more extensive.  We wanted to try something new, and settled on a Bordeaux-style blend from Napa (Robert Craig \"Affinity\").  It wound up being really good for the price, and went really well with our steaks.  Their wine markups didn't seem too bad, especially comparing to other restaurants in this price range.  Our bottle was less than 2x of the retail price, as opposed to the 2-3x markup you see at some other restaurants.\n\nService was pretty good, you can always find a server when you need them but they're not all over you.  One thing that was pretty curious was that the bathrooms had some sort of malfunction (water started coming up from the drains!) and we were surprised with their swiftness in dealing with the situation.  Probably within the hour, they had everything cleaned up as if nothing happened, so we thought they dealt with the problem really well.\n\nWe don't go to steakhouses often, since it always seems so easy to just cook steak at home (as opposed to fancy French dishes).  However, I felt like we got our money's worth here, in terms of the ambiance, getting pampered, and perfectly cooked steaks.  Hubby likes the ribeye at Ruth's Chris better, but I like the filet here more (might have something to do w/ the foie gras on top).  We've only ever been at Ruth's Chris during DAT though and pay so much less that it's probably not a fair comparison.  It's not as fancy-shmancy as Alexander's but I actually liked their steak here better, and it's a much better value overall due to their larger portions.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you're looking for a good steak in the city.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-10-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Filet Rossini-8oz filet with black truffle sauce and seared foie gras wins every time.\n\n"], "author": "Allen K.", "review": "This place gets my vote for best steak in the city.

The restaurant was not open, however, and we had to wait on the sidewalk with other early dining patrons which was an odd way to start the evening.  Even the valet staff was on duty, but the restaurant did not unlock the door until 4:59 (Our reservation was at 5:00).  It is not a customer friendly policy for an upscale restaurant and even more puzzling in that it is a missed opportunity for the bar.\n\nWhen we were seated at our table, the ambiance was very nice as described by other Yelpers.  I am a big fan of the dark, wood paneled, old fashion steakhouse, but the decor in this restaurant struck a good balance of traditional and modern.  It is worth noting that almost all of the tables in the restaurant are booths and the tables for 2 are quite small (although due to our early dinner, we were seated at a larger table, which we appreciated).  \n\nBefore I get into the food, I want to say that the service was excellent and in particular, our server, Lucy, managed to handle quite a number of tables, but was always available to refill our wine glasses or attend to other needs.  She was also helpful in answering our questions about the menu.\n\nThe menu is a traditional steakhouse menu with all of the popular cuts of beef, steak sauces and a few additional dishes for the customers who prefer something other than beef.  While we were looking at the menu, a plate of toasted bread and cheese spread was provided, which wasn't very flavorful.  Unless you are really hungry, you might want to skip this (they also provide a nice baguette with the meal).  I brought my own bottle of wine and felt the corkage fee was reasonable at $25.  The server decanted the wine and filled our glasses throughout the meal.  The wine list seemed quite sufficient and had a number of moderately priced options, but I already had a special wine that I wanted to bring and enjoy with our dinner.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer to share, which was the Veal Sweetbreads with a sauteed cream sauce.  The sweetbreads were well cooked and the mushroom sauce was flavorful, but the dish lacked a bit of a WOW factor that we had hoped for.  Very good, very competent preparation, however.\n\nWe also ordered wedge and spinach salads, both of which were good and not overly dressed.  When we were placing our order, the server suggested half portions of the salads, which was a great suggestion and delivered a perfect portion for our meal.  \n\nAs far as the steak goes, we both ordered the bone in ribeye, which is accompanied by potato and daily vegetable (Asparagus).  I had noticed that other Yelp reviews discussed the temperature of the steak preparation, so we made sure that we clarified how the steaks should be ordered.  Typically, medium rare is how I prefer my steak prepared (erring on the rarer side) and my companion prefers even rarer.  The server steered us to either ordering rare or Black and Blue (rare with a charred crust).  We both ordered rare and while I really enjoyed the steak, it was cooked more than what most people would consider \"rare\".  Definitely order an undercooked steak, if you don't like it too well done.  The baked potato comes with the typical toppings served table side and the potato of the evening, buttermilk mashed was well prepared.\n\nFinally, because it was a special occasion, I went for dessert an ordered Baked Alaska, which is something that I haven't seen on a menu in many years.  Knowing that it was a special occasion, they also served an ice cream sandwich with homemade cookies and an amazing chocolate sauce.  The Baked Alaska was good, but the cookie was even better!  A nice end to a wonderful dinner.  \n\nAll in all, a very good, competent steakhouse (except for the odd steak temperature  approach).  Everything was very good, but nothing was exceptional, except for the server, Lucy.  A good special occasion or business dinner location.  \n\nOne additional note is that they have live jazz music in the lounge, which we couldn't hear in the dining room, but looked like it was worth the trip just for the lounge.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-06-30"}], "deep fried onion rings or mushrooms": [], "traditional onion soup": [{"excerpts": ["He was told it wasnt French but traditional onion soup and equally amazing.

I was a bit hesitant when told it came with sugar snap peas because most places don't string them properly, but these guys did, and they were nice and crunchy.

My mom also had the scalloped potatoes, which were quite good, and we all shared a hefty side of creamed spinach (probably 50/50 high quality cream to spinach).\n\nAll the food was filling, classic, and perfect for a dinner with the parents. I'm vegetarian, so it would have been nice to have more vegetarian options; but, I did not get a stink-eye when I only ordered a salad with dressing on the side. I appreciated that, bc at the steakhouse across the street (ahem, HoPR), I was always haggled a bit for only ordering a side dish or salad, and eating bread. On the contrary, our waiter treated us well. \n\nFor the birthdays: we even got two complementary scoops of vanilla ice cream in a small waffle cup and a bruleed marshmallow candle to share! Between this and coffee, we did not need more dessert.

We ordered the clams and onion soup...Clams were AMAZING.  The broth was addictingly good and with Acme bread to complement the broth, we finished up the entire bowl quickly.  The onion soup was just OK.  The pepper taste was too overwhelming and honestly, I like the traditional onion soup with the baked cheese on top and bread inside.\n\nI ordered the filet mignon which comes with snap peas and a choice of potato... I chose the scalloped potatoes and was all over the sides!  They were very well prepared...  the snap peas were juicy and crunchy, the scalloped  potatoes were full of rich flavor, crunchy on the top and smooth below.  ahhhhhhh  typing it right now makes my mouth drool!\nThe filet mignon came medium rare as requested and it was just OK.  The taste wasn't there for me and I usually imagine filet mignon to almost melt in my mouth and it was actually very tough.

To start off, we were served Crostini with cheese spread and warm Pain Epi supplied from Acme Bread Co., both were good and the latter was exceptional with its crunchy exterior and fluffy texture.\n\nNext up we had the traditional onion soup and the daily special mushroom clam bisque.  Both were well done and I especially liked the bisque with the copious bits of clam and smooth mushroom flavor at the end of each spoonful.\n\nNow, the entrees - Steak Diane, Pan Roasted Breast of Chicken with a Sherry glaze, and Atlantic Grilled Salmon with Champagne sauce.  Wow, just...wow.  The execution of these dishes was simply extraordinary and the chicken and salmon, in fact, have set a new personal standard against which all future poultry and fish dishes will be compared =D\n\nThe filet mignon was literally melt-in-your-mouth and perfectly complemented by the cognac and shallot demi glace.  The chicken breast was so juicy, rounded out by a delicious, zesty seasoning.  Finally, the salmon was so tender that it had an outright creamy texture to it upon first bite.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Guinness Chocolate Cake and Classic Creme Brulee.  The cake turned out to be only okay - somewhat bland butterscotch frosting and dry texture.  The Guinness ice cream though, was fantastic and tasted exactly like the stout: no more, no less.  The creme brulee was very smooth and creamy, but I would've appreciated having it served colder rather than at room temperature.  \n\nLastly, the service here was some of the best I've seen yet: extremely well-mannered, great awareness and timing with orders and refills, and even the maitre d' and bread/water server came by to ask how our food was!

They make it look so easy to be classy. The dark wood accents can be a bit stuffy to some, but I didn't mind it.\nMr. Joy had made reservations for dinner. When we arrived, the host whisked us to a spacious booth. It looked like the entire dining room was decked out in leather booths.\n\nThey started us off with some good bread. The toasted slices were accompanied with a small ramekin filled to the brim with butter so soft it was like cream.\nMy martini was nice and strong. The rest of it was chilled in a little ice bucket.\n\n$15 Crab Cakes w/ Buerre Blanc:\nThey were okay. The shredded crab meat was crumbly and dry inside and the breading could have been more crunchy, but I guess that's what the buerre blanc was for. There was quite of bit of the buttery sauce. \n\n$46 Petite Filet Mignon 8 oz. w/ potato gratin:\nDelicious filet was cooked to a wonderful, juicy medium rare with beautiful grill marks on the outside, a little pink on the inside. My knife cut through it with ease. The soft, scalloped potatoes were buttery and cheesy.\n\n$53 Bone-in Ribeye w/ baked potato:\nMr. Joy's steak was amazing as well with the added benefit of the flavor of meat on the bone. The baked potato was enormous. The butter dissolved into the potato nicely, but beneath it, the potato was a little chalky. It was topped with a hefty amount of sour cream and chives.\n\nBoth plates were garnished with a little rosemary. Our seasonal vegetables were snap peas and some julienned carrots. Alright, not bad, but definitely added some much needed crunch in the meal.\n\n$9 Molten Chocolate Cake:\nMr. Joy said he was tired of bread pudding and I guess I order it very often, so we went with the molten chocolate cake. It was served with some ice cream (strawberry?) inside a wafer-thin cookie topped with a surfboard-looking piece of chocolate, and adorned with a sprig of mint. There was also a lit candle sitting in a dollop of whipped cream. I wish I had taken a shot of the gooey chocolate fudge inside the cake. It was yummy!\n\nHarris' is a great classic steakhouse in my opinion. If I ever return, I'd go for the Japanese ribeye.

", "For an appetizer we got the crab cakes, which only two come out, and the flavor was just okay.  "], "author": "Angeline Z.", "review": "Okay so this review will be a little bit in the middle.  I didn't think it was as amazing as everyone else on here has ranted and raved about or even met the expectations that my friends have set for this place.\n\nFirst I do want to say it was a super classy place, and the ambiance is nicer than the Ruth's Chris down the street, and the staff is incredibly polite, friendly, and most important knowledgeable on the food they are serving.  I asked my waiter several questions about their cuts and what meat he recommends and so on., and typically I haven't encountered many waiters to really give a full 'accurate' description of what would end up on my plate.\n\nAfter looking up their menu online I had m heart set on trying their American Style Kobe 15 oz. Wagyu steak.  Now if you do not know what Wagyu beef is, it's a specific pedigree meant for the finest , buttery, tender cut you should ever experience.  Reason being is that in Japan these cows are literally massaged everyday, and limited in their use of their muscles yielding in an extremely tender meat. Anyways, I have always wanted to try a \"Kobe\" or Wagyu steak, however, many steakhouses have this so-called \"Kobe\" but it is not Wagyu.  So one of my spouse's first questions for our waiter was to find out if this was 100% Wagyu beef as it was stated at Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino that Japan is not currently exporting this cut right now.  Well, that was confirmed here at Harris'.  The steak is not 100% Wagyu reason, why they call it an American Style.  So these cows are not pampered the extreme traditional way that a Wagyu cow is such as being lifted up and carried to each location.  It's a hybrid of how we treat our cows in America with the Wagyu cut.  Well to me that is unfortunate, but it makes sense that is why that steak would only cost $78 bucks.  So, I didn't feel the need to really buy that steak as it was not 100% Wagyu.  Just a tip for anyone seeking the traditional Wagyu steak.\n\nMoving right a long, my spouse got the Maine Lobster and petite filet mignon, and I got the Filet Mignon Rossini.  For an appetizer we got the crab cakes, which only two come out, and the flavor was just okay.  You do get started off with free crustini's with special spreads, and for dessert we ordered the creme brulee. \n\nAnyhow, I was really looking forward to my filet mignon with the grilled foie gras, which the foie gras was AMAZING!!!  I wish I could say the same for my filet mignon as well as my spouse's, but there was just something off that wasn't our preference.  The texture of the meat was a bit grainy for lack of a better word.  I mean don't get me wrong it was melt in your mouth meat, but it was just a bit grainy, and not sure if that is due to the cows being corn fed, but I don't know.  You can also tell they cook their steaks on an open grill and may have a little mesquite smoke to it, something I could have definitely lived without.  I also didn't like the flavor of my steak, somewhat bland, BUT, I am not sure if that is our faults as we paired our steak with a Petite Sirah from Imagery Estate and it was incredibly peppery and possibly overwhelmed my palate.  Something that was nice is that the steaks actually came with vegetables and your choice of a baked potato or the evening potato.  Most steakhouses, usually charge an additional cost.\n\nAnyhow, I was disappointed with my food experience at this restaurant due to the flavors, however, the following morning, we heated up the steak with our scallop potatoes (it was the evening potato that accompanied our steak).  I would have to say the flavor was AMAZING the following morning and the texture was not grainy. So in terms of flavor the night of the meal I would have only given them a 3 star (foie gras was a 5 star though!!), and the next morning I would have given their steak a 5 star. So, I rated this place with a 4 based on the meal the next day.\n\nSorry for the rambling, but overall an a great experience, and I'll have to go back and possibly try their rib-eye which I think they are known for and review this place once again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-02-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I came back here for a birthday dinner and ordered a dual petite filet mignon over veggies and scallop potatoes.

Our anniversary comes along and surprise, surprise, he chose Harris' restaurant. Coincidence? I don't know.\n\nOn arriving, my boyfriend was lucky enough to find parking right in front of Harris' as opposed to paying $10 flat rate for valet parking which isn't bad because we've done it for Ruth's Chris. Very convenient.\n\nFrom the exterior, Harris' is more polished looking than other steakhouses on Van Ness like Ruth's Chris or House of Prime Rib. It definitely had the essence of high class elegance.\n\nTable for two. We were escorted to a booth but were given options to sit wherever we desired, of course we chose the leather booths! It was just my boyfriend and I but we like the extra space. Not only were they comfy but they were clean. Booths are really hard to slide into and the kind host moved the table for us to sit which was nice and they do it for all their guests that sit in the leather booths.\n\nOur waiter arrived with menus. All the waiters and waitresses in the restaurant matched with burgundy vests, white long-sleeved collars, black slacks and shoes. The servers wore more of a chef-esque outfit in all white without those hats.\n\nI'm underage and forgot that my boyfriend no longer is but water was served in crystal water glasses. They don't have ordinary pitches of water here, they're steel. We were given two different kinds of bread with cheddar spread and butter to start. I've never tried cheddar spread but it was tasteful.\n\nCaesar salad to begin. A lady followed with a large pepper grinder. It was really thoughtful of them because we had smaller salt and pepper shakers on our table that sat close to the candle. Still a very nice gesture.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the 49er cut while I got the filet Mignon. There's a 4 inch difference with the filet Mignon and the petite filet Mignon. I opted for the larger cut. Both were served with vegetables and a side of mashed potatoes or baked potato. We both got the baked potato. Places like Ruth's Chris have you order the sides separately.\n\nOnce the food arrived, our waiter told us the condiments for the baked potato were behind. I thought he wanted us to get up and get it ourselves and sure enough, another man comes with a serving metal tray with sour cream, soften butter, and chives. He gracefully put it on our baked potatoes depending on requests. \n\nI like my steaks well-done, and always get steak sauce with my steak. I still like the taste of the steak with sauce but let me just tell you about the steak alone. It is tender and juicy for a well-done steak, yes. I'm so used to dried, almost burnt steaks, haha. Even though I didn't need steak sauce to savor it down, I still like the taste of it.\n\nWhen we asked for A1 sauce, my boyfriend and I are so used to it given to us in the A1 bottle like most steakhouses but not at Harris', it's given to you in a gravy boat. Yes, a gravy boat.\n\nWe're always too full to get dessert but our waiter suggest we take a look anyway, which was really nice of him. The dessert list is really short but they have lots of wines and liquor but of course, still young (just a few days, literally). It's nice that they include the pastry chefs name in the dessert menu too, I'm not sure if they did that for the standard menu though.\n\nWe're all used to restaurants having the standard black \"leather\" guest check/bill presenter with the credit card holder sponsored by one a credit card company. Not at Harris', they have their own guest check presenters. Very nice touch.\n\nSome people might think that it's expensive which it is but you pay for what you get, really. The atmosphere, the people, the food. All excellent. I liked it better than Ruth's Chris quite frankly. We've paid more in other restaurants like Melting Pot which had horrible service, atmosphere, and food.. never again. But you won't get that kind of service from Harris'. They're top notch and one of the finest restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nUpon leaving, we were greeted goodbye by the host. They had toffee in a clear glass bowl with silver tong on a plate right beside it. No peppermint wrapped in plastic over here!\n\nOverall, great restaurant, great service, great food. \n\nThomas was our waiter and he was completely generous and not irritated by us. He helped take a picture of us as he joked that he was technologically impaired since I had an dslr, hehe. But he did just fine.\n\nYou can tell, we're new to this kind of service.

I was wearing a white-and-black checked silk shirt, because that's what people did back then, and listening to Steve Winwood remind me that you can always get back what you once lost.  The song made sense to me, because I intended that very night to get back the girlfriend I had lost by being stupid.  I remember, too, how all that turned out.  But what I prefer to remember is that perfect, sunset-drenched moment of perfect hope and pure music, where the plan seemed as fool-proof as anything I had ever envisioned, and the payoff looked as tantalizing as anything I could ever imagine.  At a minimum, the memory serves to remind me that my excessive optimism has deep roots in my personal history, even though it may not always pay off.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-04-03"}, {"excerpts": ["And the Porterhouse steak.\n", "Very good atmosphere(romantic).\n", "But the waiter don`t pay very much attention after he served your food to check if everything is alright, was a little disappointing."], "author": "Sandy W.", "review": "Oh man that place has amazing good meat.\nMy favorite is the Steak-Tatare very fresh.\nAnd the Porterhouse steak.\nVery good atmosphere(romantic).\nBut the waiter don`t pay very much attention after he served your food to check if everything is alright, was a little disappointing.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-09-11"}, {"excerpts": ["i had the porterhouse steak and my lady got  prime rib.\n"], "author": "Wilson H.", "review": "my lady brought me here for my bday and was told there was a dress code.\n\nme, not a dress code type, i wore nice jeans, dress shirt and shoes, and a nice blazer.\n\nafter arriving at harris, we had to wait 15-20 mins longer then our reservation time, and the service was super slow.\n\nafter being seated, i saw people coming in normal clothes. for a place that has a business casual dress code, they sure dont enforce it.\nfor the price you pay to eat here, it would be nice to see people dressed up to step foot in here.\n\nthe food was alright.\ni had the porterhouse steak and my lady got  prime rib.\nthe steak was tasteless but the prime rib was delicious.\n\nits way overpriced for what you get here.\nbeing nosy, i looked through the menu for the most expensive things, and it seems the most expensive meat is kobe steak for $75 a cut and a bottle of wine or champagne for $2995.

Our reservation was at 7pm on Saturday evening. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we eventually found free street parking just a block away from the restaurant on Van Ness. Sweet! There are two entrances, a single door at the corner of Van Ness and Pacific, right under the Harris' logo. And the other has double doors just down the side of the building on Pacific, adjacent to the cool window display of dry-aged meats. We were brought to our seats immediately after checking in with the hostess, and directed to the impressive main Van Ness room: high ceilings, dark woods, large booths, as well as smaller booths for 2 where we dined for the evening. Service was friendly and timely: our waiter came by just enough to check in during our meal.\n\nWe started off with cocktails. The little miss ordered the French 75, while I tried the Aviation. Both were tasty! Hers came in a flute, while mine was served up in a smaller sized martini glass, with the excess kept in a small carafe over ice in a cute mini wood bucket. Nice presentation!\n\nFor dinner we ordered the Harris steak, which is a bone-in NY cut steak, as well as the bone-in rib-eye, with a bottle of Zinfandel to share. I asked our waiter for his opinion, and he mentioned that both steaks were quite popular. People enjoy the dry-aged flavors of the NY cut, and folks also enjoy the marbling of the rib-eye. Win-win. The gf wanted to add seared foie gras on top of the rib-eye for that extra good good. Our waiter suggested to upgrade her choice by preparing her rib-eye Rossini style, with foie gras and truffle Cabernet sauce. Got 'em. Both came with asparagus and our choice of potatoes for sides. We had mashed potatoes, the evening's preparation. We also ordered a side of cream of spinach, which in retrospect we didn't need. It wasn't that special either. Our steaks, on the other hand, were delicious! While both steaks were exceptional, we agreed that the rib-eye was the winner of the night. For dessert, we gave their Guinness chocolate cake a try. She was not impressed, but I liked it! The good folks at Harris' were kind enough to personalize our dessert to commemorate the occasion.

Everyone loves steak. Meh, I have some friends who do not like steak. Not because they're vegetarians - they just don't like steak. Weird. But we can talk about that some other time...\n\nI LOVE A GOOD STEAK. And I love a good, old-school authentic steak house. Morton's is good, but nothing special (anymore). Ruth's Chris has good steaks. Both are perfectly decent, but at the end of the day, they feel like chains. Harris' is family owned, and it just feels more 'authentic' - whatever that means. Have spoken to many of the servers and bartenders, and a good handful of them have been there for years! It shows in the quality of service. \n\nI come often with friends and try to sit in the bar area as it feels more intimate and casual *and* I have come a time or three in shorts, so the bar area is just more comfortable. I do not know how often they have live music in the bar, but it is special when they do - just quiet, lounge-y music appropriate for the venue.\n\nIt's also fun to sit at the bar if you're dining on your own. Love striking up conversations with the bartenders - Robert, David, Freddy, all lovely - and with the other single diners. Have met so many interesting people: a young quirky women who *insisted* I sample her sweetbreads (I did!), and a beautiful women in her 80s who was flirting with me, and I suppose I was flirting with her too...\n\nHighlights:\n\nDrinks - I go back and forth between a straight vodka martini (Ketel One) or a Manhattan (bartender's choice). Hard to mess up, but still good and classic. Re: wine, the bartenders and servers know the menu, and make great recommendations. \n\nMy go-to salad is *always* the iceberg wedge. Probably the best wedge I have ever had. They'll happily split it if you're with a date.\n\nGreat starters are anything foie gras, which lately has been coming in a chilled or a seared version. I have enjoyed both. The sweetbreads are listed as a starter, but it's really big enough for a main - or split it. The steak tartar is listed as a starter too, but again, probably more of a main.

Added, I also had great expectations heading to Harris'--after trying and loving House of Prime Ribs down the street and hearing rave reviews about how Harris' even tops that.\n\nSo onto the experience.\n\nThe atmosphere and environment is just right: exactly what you'd expect in an upscale American fine-dining steakhouse. We were seated in the main dining room, gently lit. It was a 6pm dinner, so not quiet so packed yet, but a good amount of diners were there. As the dinner progressed, a live jazz band started playing in the small dining room, and it really added to the mood.\n\nThe food:\n\nWe started off with the appetizer grilled foie gras with toast, and an orange marmalade. Love the toast, and it really goes well with the foie gras and the sauce. What's not to love? The foie gras itself... unfortunately, it just wasn't the same as what I thought it would be (perhaps I had a wrong image in my mind). Perhaps it was also due to I was not feeling that great, but it was way too greasy for me. I couldn't really finish it.\n\nThe steak tartare, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. Not as delicately prepared in a tiny bowl as in other restaurants, but the flavor and the freshness is perfect! \n\nAlso they serve you a cracker with cheddar and wine paste appetizer, which is amazing as well!\n\nAfter the appetizers were the steak itself. I got the Harris Steak, medium rare. It's done really well, juicy and tender. Surprisingly, there was no sauce on the steak, but it's juicy and flavored enough that you don't actually need any either.\n\nIt wasn't bad or anything, just a bit disappointing.

It's an old school steakhouse w/ dark woods, spacious booths and tables and a meat counter.  A valet parks your car, a not inconsiderable convenience in this part of San Francisco.  Or any part, for that matter.  Our experience was flawless.  We were seated at a table in a small library-like side room by the bar w/ built-in bookshelves flanking a fireplace over which hung a portrait of \"The Boss\".  We were brought toasted bread rounds w/ cheese and butter while we perused the menu.  We decided to share a spinach salad, a petite boneless New York steak, the bone-in ribeye and a side of creamed spinach.\n\nService was attentive, w/ water glasses kept filled and bread brought.  Both the waiter and the busser were present and available.  The waiter even was able to answer Alan's query about the Raiders-Jets game this afternoon.  The couple at the adjacent table got involved in the discussion, he being a Jets fan while she was a Patriots fan.\n\nI started w/ a gin martini, de rigeur for a steakhouse.  It was good.  We placed our orders, both steaks ordered medium rare since we were sharing them.  I ordered a baked potato and Alan requested onion rings rather than a potato, a request that was generously accommodated.  The salad arrived split and was not only delicious but substantial, w/ lots of baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, pitted kalamata olives and sweet yellow pear shaped tomatoes lightly dressed w/ a tasty vinaigrette.  When the steaks arrived I cut the baked potato in half, giving one half to Alan.  Butter, sour cream and chives were offered.  Rather than 3 or 4 onion rings as Alan had expected, there were probably close to a dozen of them on the plate.  I had a few and they were crisp and good.  The steaks were accompanied by lightly sauteed green beans and carrot strips.  Both steaks were tender, flavorful and cooked medium rare, the New York a little firmer than the ribeye.  The creamed spinach was tasty, w/ a hint of nutmeg.  Around 6:00 a pianist and bass player started playing in the bar, sounding very good.

We had a reservation for 6:30pm so we rushed through SF traffic and barely made it on time to the restaurant. We pulled up to the front of the restaurant for the valet service ($10 + tip) and were met by two gentlemen who were beyond polite. After I had entered the restaurant, one of the valets had noticed my wallet in the car and had come into the restaurant to notify me. That surprised me a bit and made me like this restaurant even more.   \n\nAt the host table, we were greeted by a gentleman who quickly seated us and showed us the menus. Our server Devon came by soon afterward to take down our orders. They started us off with some bread, butter, and some sort of spread. I could not put my hands on what the spread was, but it was quite delicious with subtle flavors. \n\nI ordered the executive cut of the Prime Rib (medium rare) w/ scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach. The outskirts of the prime rib were more thoroughly cooked and seasoned, while the center was fairly pink and tender. I remember sticking my fork in the prime rib and it went straight through with ease... it was that tender. As far as the sides go, the creamed spinach was amazing while the scalloped potatoes were somewhat standard. My girlfriend ordered the Steak Diane (medium rare) w/ baked potatoes. The steak was drenched in some sort of glaze sauce that had great flavor, but it wasn't overpowering.  \n\nThe only thing that I could complain about this restaurant was that the table was a bit small (I'm nitpicking at this point). The booth that they sat us at had enough seating room for two, but it would get cluttered at times. The table got packed with the bread plates, water glass, and wine glass, but after they cleared the table for the main course, there was more than enough room. \n\nWhen I looked around, I noticed that my girlfriend and I were probably the youngest people there. Everyone seemed to be in their mid 30's and up... I guess the high price point drove away all the broke youngsters. \n\nI must say that I am thoroughly impressed with this place.

Walking up to the entrance there's a ton of porterhouse steaks being dry aged right through the front windows.  When entering the restaurant it reminded me of the classic steakhouses in New York with the bar area right in front.  Then the dim lighting, old booth styled seating, and dark wood everywhere.

I don't know why this city lacks a real steakhouse the quality of a Keens or Old Homestead in NYC (shudder at the thought of having a Luger's or a Wolfgang's on a good day).  But it does, and this is what we get.\n\nIt's not bad.  I'm not going to say it's leagues better than a good night at Ruth's Chris or even Morton's.  I suppose it's better if you don't want the generic chain approach.\n\nSo the good - the Steak Diane was excellent.  Nice quality filet, excellent caramelized sauce.  Actually it was the sauce that saved this steak from being just another mediocre (yet high quality) cut of beef.  The dark, deep, sweet richness of the shallots, the savory-ness of drippings.  I dream of dabbing a fresh slab of French bread into the sauce and eating some roast beef with horseradish smothered in it.\n\nThe Pepper Steak was fine, though less successful and reveals the fundamental problem with Harris' as a steakhouse.  The peppercorn sauce was adequate but just lacked presence and personality to make up for a good quality, but relatively flavorless strip steak.  Why does the beef lack flavor?  Is it a fear of aging?  Minerality?  Lack of intense surface char?\n\nI remember biting into my first real steak at Keens, and oh man, the gaminess - it was pungent, fragrant, yes, dare I say, hinting at what I would have once thought to be past-due beef.  But man, once you get over the slight shock/revulsion and get that this is how it's supposed to taste, that steak was a revelation.  What flavor!  It's like trying a good blue cheese and allowing the robustness to drag you, mouth first, into a new taste sensation.\n\nSadly, none of that is here.  Nor do the steaks benefit from a pure, straightforward meat flavor intensified with a great char/seasoning.  So when you have an excellent shallot sauce to make up for it, like in the Diane, great.  When you don't, either on the Pepper Steak or the other, unadorned cuts, you end up with a fine, but not extraordinary, piece of meat.\n\nScalloped potatoes were pretty spot on excellent.  Other sides were just kind of there.  Onion rings, fried mushrooms, creamed spinach, nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhen I think about the salads at Harris', I miss the crazy crispness, overwhelming quantity, rich, intense blue cheese flavor with the perfect accents of tomato and bacon from the iceberg wedge at Morton's.  That salad is more steak-like than most steaks, now that I think about it.  There's nothing subtle about it, and that's how I want it.  Salads here are fine but they only remind me of amazing salads -- actually they kinda pale in comparison if I'm really being honest.\n\nBut what an excellent salted caramel cheesecake.  The pure flavor and essence of the salt, caramel - hang on, perhaps there's a theme here, that Harris' carmelizes things well.  But it doesn't.  The steak crust caramelization is lacking, especially compared to the awesomeness of the crust at Luger's or (again, on a good day) Wolfgang's.  The carmelized onion side was fine, but lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for.\n\nStill, I guess there's a reason I keep coming back.  Not like there are many other choices in town.  Skip the prime rib.  Skip the ribeye.  Definitely skip the rediculous wagyu crap (not unique to Harris', though it's a story worth a post of its own.)  Skip the appetizers and most of the sides.

The hostess walked by and loudly announced that we couldn't sit there and we should move to the bar. Rule broken: don't make paying customers get up and move around an empty bar when they are interested in buying a $18 martini. The bartenders and bar staff seemed shocked that this woman just yanked an order+ tip away from them. \n\nFlustered with her rudeness, I suggested we sit instead, early for our 6:45 meal. she walked us to our reserved booth and left the menus in a sloppy pile at the edge of the table. I was so appalled by her UNWELCOMING nastiness that I considered leaving right then and there. \n\nThankfully we didn't have to encounter her again and we had a classic steakhouse feast served by Michael G., a generous & kind server. Ordered some signature cocktails, a bottle of Louis Martini and a mass helping of sides to accompany our steaks.

We also shared a bottle of champagne to celebrate my 21st.  For my dinner I chose the regular cut of prime rib & opted for the veggie of the day instead of the cream spinach along with my baked potato.

The people at the front were very nice too.  I can't compare Harris' to House of Prime Rib since I haven't been to HOPR in years; but while HOPR may give you a little more (salad, popover with your meal) there's nothing like eating at Harris to make you feel classier.

To start off, we were served Crostini with cheese spread and warm Pain Epi supplied from Acme Bread Co., both were good and the latter was exceptional with its crunchy exterior and fluffy texture.\n\nNext up we had the traditional onion soup and the daily special mushroom clam bisque.  Both were well done and I especially liked the bisque with the copious bits of clam and smooth mushroom flavor at the end of each spoonful.\n\nNow, the entrees - Steak Diane, Pan Roasted Breast of Chicken with a Sherry glaze, and Atlantic Grilled Salmon with Champagne sauce.  Wow, just...wow.  The execution of these dishes was simply extraordinary and the chicken and salmon, in fact, have set a new personal standard against which all future poultry and fish dishes will be compared =D\n\nThe filet mignon was literally melt-in-your-mouth and perfectly complemented by the cognac and shallot demi glace.  The chicken breast was so juicy, rounded out by a delicious, zesty seasoning.  Finally, the salmon was so tender that it had an outright creamy texture to it upon first bite.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Guinness Chocolate Cake and Classic Creme Brulee.  The cake turned out to be only okay - somewhat bland butterscotch frosting and dry texture.  The Guinness ice cream though, was fantastic and tasted exactly like the stout: no more, no less.  The creme brulee was very smooth and creamy, but I would've appreciated having it served colder rather than at room temperature.  \n\nLastly, the service here was some of the best I've seen yet: extremely well-mannered, great awareness and timing with orders and refills, and even the maitre d' and bread/water server came by to ask how our food was!

If smoking were allowed indoors, this place would reek of cigars.  Dark wood, live jazz, wait staff in ties and white jackets.  My favorite style of restaurant seating, round booths.  It's like you're all cozied up in some enormous tufted leather chair.\r\nFor private parties, there is a room called the Library Room, which makes me think of the game Clue - i.e. Professor Plum did it with the Lead Pipe in the Library.

Think Onion Soup is all about the cheese?  Try this one.  The flavor is excellent.\r\n\r\nRare Steak:\r\nMy advice with premium aged meat such as they serve at Harris' is keep it simple.  What I mean is go with a preparation that doesn't involve a lot of sauce.  For example, choose the Ribeye or Filet Mignon over the Steak Diane.  If you like sauce, order the Bearnaise on the Side.

Several other Yelpers had mentioned that their steaks were overcooked too, so if I were to go again, I would request my steak, rare. It took 10 mins to get a new one.\n\nMy perfectly grilled 8 oz. filet was crowned with a generous slab of seared foie gras with juices oozing from the sides. As I cut into the filet and the foie gras, the juices from the foie gras dripped into the filet, marinating each fiber with decadent richness. The well-seasoned filet was soft, tender and the foie gras was like crumbles of fat that melted in my palate. Together, the filet and foie gras married and created the perfect harmony of rich, beefy and savory goodness. The black truffle cabernet sauce was complex and had depth of flavor to it; adding that a layer of earthiness with a tangy rich sweetness that set this dish over the top! \n\n*SIDES: Our entrees came with a choice of a Baked Potato or Cheese Scalloped Potatoes. \n\n--BAKED POTATO: OK! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=UCfw-bRQf84F1fJcp9ZhRw \nIt was just a plain baked potato you can get at any chain restaurant like Sizzler's or Red Lobster. \n\n--CHEESE SCALLOPED POTATOES: GOOD! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=4r10-Sw5q6yxaHA0LiNXFQ\nThe slices of potatoes were stacked and then topped with cheese.

The lemon ice cream was refreshingly tart with a hint of sweetness while the sponge cake was rich and buttery, but light. The combo of all three created contrasting warm/cold temperatures, crisp, smooth, and soft textures with sweet, creamy and refreshing citrus flavors. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nProfessional and attentive but pretentious.

I desparately wanted to give five stars, but I was not crazy about my porterhouse, and the sides could use some work. Now that I explained my relatively \"low\" four-star review, on to the good stuff... \n\nEverything from the service, decor, and ambiance add to the phenomenal dining experience. We start of course, with the food. The grilled foie gras with grill toast and fire roasted marmalade was absolutely incredible, a perfect way to start off. \n\nFor the main course, I had the 16 oz. porterhouse and my wife had the filet mignon rossini. One side of my porterhouse was a little tough, while the other side was absolutely perfect. When I tried my wife's filet mignon, I couldn't stop digging into it (much to her chagrin).  It was lively, flavorful, and simply amazing. \n\nService was nothing short of excellent. If you look up perfect customer service, you'll probably find our server's picture next to it. No need to ever look around to find him. It's like he has ESP, reading our minds as to what we need and checking often without being annoying.  He was knowledgeable of the menu and gave insightful suggestions. \n\nThe decor was pretty good, though I would have preferred to sit in the jazz room rather than the booth (as an aside, I've never been a fan of booths). \n\nOverall, I'd recommend Harris to anyone without hesitation.

Looks like Gary Danko or Masa's would have been a better but I'm happy to say that at least we gave it a try.\n\nFor a top of a line steakhouse, one has expectations.  My simple request?  Keep up with the times.  Sure, I'm all about the environment because it adds to the experience.  But when you see paint chipping from a wall, bathrooms that are two decades behind, and wood varnishing that needs to take place, one starts to wonder.  I do, however, have to say that the lounge was quite comfortable and the perfect place to mingle with a good social and younger crowd.\n\nOur service was good and the environment not too noisy.  There was a dull drone as dinner parties took to their own decibel level and most of the clientele this evening were the 40/50+ crowd.  I like to eat my steak when it is not too noisy so it was perfect.  I ordered the Rib Eye, requested rare.  This came accompanied with sauteed sugar snap peas and a baked potato.  While the peas were pretty amazing, they were a bit heavy handed with the oil as it left a slight slick on my plate.  The steak?  Pretty good, even though I found it slightly more gristly and fibrous to my liking.  The last Rib Eye I had was at Ruth Chris and that had literally melted in my mouth.  This one took a little more effort.  Otherwise, at $43, I would not order it again.\n\nAt $9 a bowl (and it was a large large bowl), skip the potato with black truffle soup unless you and your stomach are most inclined.  Otherwise, it was a pretty dense and extremely rich soup, made even worse with the delightful pieces of bread that kept on keeping up with my empty bread plate.  The waitstaff here are spot on.\n\nTwo other orders in my party:\n\nPrime Rib\nRare.  Amazingly soft and tender, despite my friend's statement that Morton's gave them a larger cut that covered the entire plate.  I was nonetheless impressed with my sample.  It melted in my mouth.\n\nFilet Mignon Rossini\nRare.  A good thick filet (could have been slightly larger) topped off with grilled foie gras and black truffle, drizzled with a cabernet sauce.  He was quite pleased with his order and even though I'm against the harvesting method of foie gras, my first ever taste of it now makes me understand why one would order it.  It was a pretty amazing nibble of the exotic and the rush of flavors on the palate: So so rich.\n\nLast but not least of all, was our dessert.  Our party had done research on Yelp and we decided on the Baked Alaska and was not disappointed.  A lovely and cute display of flamed meringue piped around ice cream in the shape of a mini bee hive.  Flanked by caramelized slices of banana and drizzled berry/chocolate sauce.  I savored this, with each creamy and sugary decadent bite,  It was enough to set me into a blissful food coma.\n\nOverall, for a large tab, we were happy and left with more than half in leftovers.  However, we did agree that the steaks were not entirely out of this world.

I didn't think it was as amazing as everyone else on here has ranted and raved about or even met the expectations that my friends have set for this place.\n\nFirst I do want to say it was a super classy place, and the ambiance is nicer than the Ruth's Chris down the street, and the staff is incredibly polite, friendly, and most important knowledgeable on the food they are serving.  I asked my waiter several questions about their cuts and what meat he recommends and so on., and typically I haven't encountered many waiters to really give a full 'accurate' description of what would end up on my plate.\n\nAfter looking up their menu online I had m heart set on trying their American Style Kobe 15 oz. Wagyu steak.  Now if you do not know what Wagyu beef is, it's a specific pedigree meant for the finest , buttery, tender cut you should ever experience.  Reason being is that in Japan these cows are literally massaged everyday, and limited in their use of their muscles yielding in an extremely tender meat. Anyways, I have always wanted to try a \"Kobe\" or Wagyu steak, however, many steakhouses have this so-called \"Kobe\" but it is not Wagyu.  So one of my spouse's first questions for our waiter was to find out if this was 100% Wagyu beef as it was stated at Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino that Japan is not currently exporting this cut right now.  Well, that was confirmed here at Harris'.  The steak is not 100% Wagyu reason, why they call it an American Style.  So these cows are not pampered the extreme traditional way that a Wagyu cow is such as being lifted up and carried to each location.  It's a hybrid of how we treat our cows in America with the Wagyu cut.  Well to me that is unfortunate, but it makes sense that is why that steak would only cost $78 bucks.  So, I didn't feel the need to really buy that steak as it was not 100% Wagyu.  Just a tip for anyone seeking the traditional Wagyu steak.\n\nMoving right a long, my spouse got the Maine Lobster and petite filet mignon, and I got the Filet Mignon Rossini.  For an appetizer we got the crab cakes, which only two come out, and the flavor was just okay.  You do get started off with free crustini's with special spreads, and for dessert we ordered the creme brulee. \n\nAnyhow, I was really looking forward to my filet mignon with the grilled foie gras, which the foie gras was AMAZING!!!  I wish I could say the same for my filet mignon as well as my spouse's, but there was just something off that wasn't our preference.  The texture of the meat was a bit grainy for lack of a better word.  I mean don't get me wrong it was melt in your mouth meat, but it was just a bit grainy, and not sure if that is due to the cows being corn fed, but I don't know.  You can also tell they cook their steaks on an open grill and may have a little mesquite smoke to it, something I could have definitely lived without.  I also didn't like the flavor of my steak, somewhat bland, BUT, I am not sure if that is our faults as we paired our steak with a Petite Sirah from Imagery Estate and it was incredibly peppery and possibly overwhelmed my palate.  Something that was nice is that the steaks actually came with vegetables and your choice of a baked potato or the evening potato.  Most steakhouses, usually charge an additional cost.\n\nAnyhow, I was disappointed with my food experience at this restaurant due to the flavors, however, the following morning, we heated up the steak with our scallop potatoes (it was the evening potato that accompanied our steak).  I would have to say the flavor was AMAZING the following morning and the texture was not grainy. So in terms of flavor the night of the meal I would have only given them a 3 star (foie gras was a 5 star though!!), and the next morning I would have given their steak a 5 star. So, I rated this place with a 4 based on the meal the next day.\n\nSorry for the rambling, but overall an a great experience, and I'll have to go back and possibly try their rib-eye which I think they are known for and review this place once again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-02-06"}, {"excerpts": ["For the main course, I had the filet mignon rossini ", "and my friend ordered the Porterhouse.

Figured I was being efficient when I ordered the filet mignon rossini. Plus, the waitress smiled approvingly after I ordered so I figured I was good to go. This may be preference but the dish was just way, way too rich. The foie gras topped on medium rare filet mignon(which I actually found to be a little tough) on a toast and then placed on top of cabernet sauce proved to be too intense for my palate.

No, no...not with a guy. I could care less about who my company is with at Harris', but if I had to compare my steak meal to something it would be the perfect first date. \n\nI arrived to my date about 10 minutes late due to traffic, but I called in and Harris' was very understanding and apperciative for my call. When I arrive, I'm warmly greeted and quickly seated to my table. Although Harris' is a fine dining establishment, I didn't feel like I was surrounded by pretentious people or uncomfortable that I wanted to scarf down my bread and smear it with copious amounts of their cheese spread. What I hate most on a first date is being judged for the way I eat. So Harris' was a perfect place to not only get the fine dining experience but to also feel comfortable in your own skin. Anyone that can make you feel comfortable with your quirks and treat you to the finer things in life is a winner in my books. \n\nAnyway, let's get back to what this date had to offer besides what was just on the surface. I had already picked out my entree weeks before even coming here due to a recommendation, which was the Filet Mignon Rossini w/ a baked potato. My other party ordered the Bone-in Ribeye w/ mashed potatoes. I appreciated the fact that they included the potato sides w/ the entree as opposed to having to pay for it separately like most fancy shmancy steakhouses.

(Also, thanks to my server who let me keep the bottle after I had made a remark that it was \"too cute to throw away\" cause it makes for a perfect vase for a half dozen of dried roses). We started our meal with the crab cakes and plate of fresh oysters. The crab cake was delish and didn't taste too heavy or buttery, like I've had at other establishments. The oysters were divine and were not skimpy at all. You can never go wrong with some aphrodisiacs on a first date. ;) Our steaks came out cooked to a perfect medium rare. I always appreciate when a date can handle their meat and to make sure it is perfect at first glance. The Filet Mignon Rossini is topped with perfectly grilled Foie Gras and Black Truffle, Cabernet sauce, and wiith just the first bite, I had my first mouthgasm. After I had given my company a bite of mine and it looked like he had died and went to heaven, he looked at his steak and looked back at me and said, \"I think they messed up my steak.\" In which, I asked, \"how so?\" He replied with the saddest look on his face and said, \"It doesn't taste like yours.\" For the rest of my meal when I would take breaks in between bites, he would quickly ask, \"Are you going to finish that?\"  Typically, I can never finish a whole steak even if it's only an 8oz, but this steak had me coming back for multiple mouthgasms. Also, because I wanted to torment him, I made sure I finished my whole steak so that I wouldn't have any leftovers. That my friends, was honestly the best perfect date I have ever had with a steak. \n\nYou can trust that you'll find me coming back for more with Harris'. He seems to be a busy man and it's been a week since I've heard back from him, but this wouldn't stop me from jumping on any opportunity to go on that second date if the opportunity arose.

"], "author": "Arlene M.", "review": "My husband wanted some steak for his birthday, so we decided to give this place a try.  I like the clubby old-school steakhouse look, but at least they don't go overboard with it so it doesn't look too stuffy.  We had reservations for 7:30 but arrived around 15min earlier, but they seated us right away anyway.\n\nHubby got one of their \"King Eider\" martinis for his ap\u00e9ritif and it looked pretty cool.  They serve it in a small-ish martini glass but they give you a tiny carafe in a little ice bucket for the rest of it...this is pretty nice, especially for people who like to nurse their drinks since it guarantees that your martini is always perfectly chilled even though it's a large portion.  I only had a small sip since I was DD for the night and it tasted really good too.\n\nFor our appetizers, we started off with the oysters and the sweetbreads.  The oysters tasted really fresh, and came 6 oysters and 3 different sauces...they were all good but I like the mignonette sauce the best.  The sweetbreads were even better, we got a pretty large portion (3 pieces) and they were seared with a nice sauce.  They were cooked perfectly and I gotta say a lot better than what I've had at some French restaurants! \n\nFor our main course, I had the filet mignon rossini and hubby got the ribeye.  My filet was cooked perfectly medium-rare, and they gave a really generous portion of nicely seared foie gras on top.  It came with a really nice red wine sauce, though I couldn't really taste the truffle that was supposed to be in the sauce.  I'm not a big potato person, but I LOVED the scalloped potatoes that came with my steak...it kinda tasted like mac&cheese but with potatoes instead of the mac.  Very yummy.  Hubby's ribeye was also really good, it had those nice little pockets of fat that ribeye steaks do, and had some nice beefy flavor from the dry-aging.  We had some mushrooms on ths side, which I thought was a little too peppery but the hubby liked it.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate cake and hubby had some sort of fruit crisp.  They were both kinda meh, but then I didn't really have great expectations at this sort of place anyway.  It satisfied the urge to have something sweet at the end of our meal, that's all.\n\nFrom looking at the website, I was kinda scared that they wouldn't have much of a wine selection, since it only indicated their banquet wine list which wasn't much.  However the wine list they have at the restaurant was much more extensive.  We wanted to try something new, and settled on a Bordeaux-style blend from Napa (Robert Craig \"Affinity\").  It wound up being really good for the price, and went really well with our steaks.  Their wine markups didn't seem too bad, especially comparing to other restaurants in this price range.  Our bottle was less than 2x of the retail price, as opposed to the 2-3x markup you see at some other restaurants.\n\nService was pretty good, you can always find a server when you need them but they're not all over you.  One thing that was pretty curious was that the bathrooms had some sort of malfunction (water started coming up from the drains!) and we were surprised with their swiftness in dealing with the situation.  Probably within the hour, they had everything cleaned up as if nothing happened, so we thought they dealt with the problem really well.\n\nWe don't go to steakhouses often, since it always seems so easy to just cook steak at home (as opposed to fancy French dishes).  However, I felt like we got our money's worth here, in terms of the ambiance, getting pampered, and perfectly cooked steaks.  Hubby likes the ribeye at Ruth's Chris better, but I like the filet here more (might have something to do w/ the foie gras on top).  We've only ever been at Ruth's Chris during DAT though and pay so much less that it's probably not a fair comparison.  It's not as fancy-shmancy as Alexander's but I actually liked their steak here better, and it's a much better value overall due to their larger portions.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you're looking for a good steak in the city.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-10-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Went back with friends and ordered steak tartare & salad for appetizer,\nand I had Filet Mignon Rossini again.\n", "Can never go wrong with it!\n", "Due to insane traffic, we arrived about 25 min late,\nso they sat us at the piano lounge instead of the reserved table we missed.\n", "I was kind of bummed at first, but the piano lounge wasn't bad at all.\n", "Definitely had a different ambiance, but I enjoyed the live jazz playing in the background =)\nServers were attentive, all of the foods were delicious,\nI give it 5 stars again :D"], "author": "Hyemin J.", "review": "Went back with friends and ordered steak tartare & salad for appetizer,\nand I had Filet Mignon Rossini again.\nCan never go wrong with it!\nDue to insane traffic, we arrived about 25 min late,\nso they sat us at the piano lounge instead of the reserved table we missed.\nI was kind of bummed at first, but the piano lounge wasn't bad at all.\nDefinitely had a different ambiance, but I enjoyed the live jazz playing in the background =)\nServers were attentive, all of the foods were delicious,\nI give it 5 stars again :D", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-02-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Filet mignon Rossini\nfilet mignon with grilled foie gras and black truffle, cabernet sauce\n", "We had it medium rare.

And I want to go here to celebrate, but I'm afraid to make the reservations, because I'm afraid I'll jinx myself, fail, and have to call the restaurant and cancel, awash in shame and humiliation.  I mention this to my husband, and smart guy he is, made the reservations himself.  And I pass. Woo-hoo!!!\n\nWe were seated immediately, and were brought the little crostini type bread and some kind of fluffy buttery stuff. My husband and I agreed: tastes like Cheetos! (but in a good, non-chemical way).\n\nWe started with the steak tartare appetizer. It was insanely good and quite a plentiful portion.  It was chopped with onions and was delicious.\n\nMy son had the shrimp cocktail. He devoured it in roughly five minutes, so I assume it was good.  I can only assume, because when I started to grab a shrimp, I thought he was going to bite my hand.\n\nThe waiter was very friendly, but not overly so. We asked for help with our wine selection. He listened carefully and  helped us pick a wine that was just perfect.\n\nThen my husband and I each had the Filet Mignon Rossini, rare, which is the filet topped with Sonoma foie gras and cabernet sauce.  Or as I like to call it, freaking heaven on a fork.  God it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly.  This is key because as a female, when I order steak rare, I don't always get it rare, like they think I don't know what I'm doing when I order.\n\nWe had scalloped potatoes, and they were so rich and creamy it was amazing.  Kid had baked potato.  What can you say about a baked potato? It was a potato that had been baked.  He asked for sour cream and butter. Kid doesn't like creativity with his food.\n\nKid had the Harris steak, which was a thick cut, bone-in New York strip.  He loved it. He is quite the carnivore.\n\nTo finish up, I had the lemon tart.  It was perfect.  Let me put it this way, my son and husband both had chocolate desserts (a cake and a brownie sundae type thing), but I was so engrossed in my lemon tart that I did not even ask for a bite (if you know me, you would know that is really something).\n\nMy son's cake, according to him, was \"awesome.\"  My husband said his sundae was good \"but not the reason I came here.  The meat eclipses the sundae.\"\n\nOne other thing I'd like to add. My son drank a cherry 7-up with the appetizer, and immediately asked for another one. He didn't get it until he got his meal. Whether this was deliberate on the part of our waiter or not, I don't know, but I am very happy, because I don't like him sucking down endless sodas.  So if it was intentional, I salute you, sir!\n\nAll in all, a wonderful topper to what was a fantastic evening.  We will definitely be back.\n\nRe: Clothing\n\nMen, if you're thinking of taking your girl here, for God's sake, put on a damn tie.

In particular, filet mignon always does it for me. After having the best filet of my life at the Metropolitan in Seattle, I've been just slightly underwhelmed by the (still very good) steak I've had in SF. Bob's, House of Prime Rib, Boboquivari's, and Ruth's Chris are all spectacular, but in my book, barely miss the mark. It's not a surprise then that I was excited to finally give Harris' a try for the very first time.\n\nOverall, Harris' was wonderful. I usually loathe pretentious four-dollar-sign restaurants, but everything about Harris' made me feel immediately comfortable and welcome--from the incredibly attentive and hospitable service to the extravagant, yet charming decor that adorned the walls. Most importantly, the food was delectable. The crab cakes with beurre blanc were out-of-this world - without question, the most amazingly delicate, savory crab cakes I've ever tasted. Even the baked potato that accompanied my steak was top-notch - it's hard to cook a baked potato that one can say is far superior to any he or she has ever tasted, but Harris' manages to pull it off.\n\nThe only four star part of my dining experience - and undoubtedly the most important part - was the steak itself. I ordered the filet mignon Rossini - a petit filet with grilled foie gras and black truffle, cabernet sauce. Although the steak was really good, it probably ranks as the third or fourth best steak I've ever had (surprising only because of Harris' premiere reputation). Although I ordered my steak medium, the first filet I was served was an overcooked medium well and the second filet I was served was an undercooked medium rare.

By the end of the meal, even though I had a really good steak, I guess my expectations were too high because I left just a tad disappointed. I expected the best steak of my life and got something that was delicious, but not worth the almost-$100 price tag.\n\nDespite this, Harris' undoubtedly provided a dining experience I won't soon forget.

The bathroom and bar was near us and the jazz band was right outside our door. My party was able to have fun, be loud and enjoy the food. Our server was miss sexy cheekbones Lucy and she was sooooo wonderful. We stayed an hour and half after closing and we totally didn't know cuz' Lucy didn't rush us at all.
