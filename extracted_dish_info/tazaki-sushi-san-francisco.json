This review is based on my takeout experience only. \n\nI came with the intention of simply ordering a specialty roll to go, as I wasn't too hungry - but the moment I walked in, my nostrils were engorged with the dazzling aroma of sweet and savory teriyaki sauce. I ended up ordering salmon teriyaki ($12.95) while my friend ordered ahi tuna teriyaki ($14.95) to go. \n\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes for our food. Each of our orders came with a side of miso soup, small side salad, white rice, and our entree - pretty standard. The miso soup was nice and hot, warming my palate at first sip. The salad was just some pieces of lettuce with thousand island drizzled over it - nothing special. \n\nNow, when I bit into the salmon teriyaki.... INSTANT DISAPPOINTMENT. When I took another bite, and another... TOTAL REGRET. The salmon was extremely bland; it didn't taste the least bit seasoned. The teriyaki sauce was light and watery, sweet and savory, but not at all powerful enough to combat the utter lack of flavor from the salmon. The salmon was also very dense and overcooked and chewy. There was nothing that could save this dish. My friend said her ahi tuna turned out similar...as in tasteless and overcooked. I am saddened to say that this was probably the worst salmon teriyaki I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant.\n\nAside from the total miss from my teriyaki takeout experience, I do remain hopeful and would give this place another shot. Everyone deserves a second chance, right? Although i can't comment too much on the service, every staff member I interacted with seemed pretty friendly. The restaurant itself is pretty cute and quaint inside as well. Next time I'll definitely skip the teriyaki and try the sashimi/sushi instead, which is what I intended to do in the first place... \n\nTl;dr - Never judge a restaurant by the way it smells...Lesson learned.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-08-18"}], "bbq short ribs": [{"excerpts": ["BBQ short ribs entree, caterpillar roll, 49er roll, white tuna sushi, spider roll, and something else.
