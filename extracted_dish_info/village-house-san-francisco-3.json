When I first walked in I was pleasantly surprised to find that they make all their dim sum fresh, right up front for everyone to see. The atmosphere of the place is nice as well. It's small, quiet, clean and pleasantly decorated. The staff is courteous and more than willing to answer any questions you may have. The size of the menu is decent for a place like this, but what's on the menu is fairly uninspired. There isn't much you won't find at any other generic Chinese-American restaurant. The real question is... is the food any good? \n\nI have been to Village House half a dozen times over the span of a few weeks to try and get a sense of quality and consistency. Unfortunately, they are one of the most inconsistent restaurants I have ever experienced. The dim sum has ranged from absolutely outstanding to a doughy, under-seasoned mess. the chicken dumpling with green chives is the only one that really blew my mind. The potstickers, which are typically one of my favorite dishes, were a total disappointment. They charge $5.95 for 4 doughy, flavorless pockets of disappointment. I can go to any number of other dim sum places and get 3 for around $2. The spicy dumplings, which were recommended to me as their most popular dish tasted okay, but made me feel ill later that day. Also, more than one my dishes were swimming in oil, which somewhat ruined it for me. Out of curiosity I tried the Chinese hamburger. It's simple and delicious. I just wish it had more filling. I would recommend it as a late-afternoon snack to anyone walking by looking for a quick bite to eat. My biggest complaint about this place isn't actually about the quality of the food it's the fact that everything is made to order, which in this case is actually a detriment to their business model. Dim sum restaurants are supposed to be fast and have small portioned, good quality dumplings at affordable prices. Village House doesn't really offer that. The prices are too high for the quality of food they provide and because everything is made to order, you have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes for even a single order of dim sum. I haven't tried any of their soups yet and I have seen quite a few people ordering it when they eat in the restaurant. They look quite good and I look forward to trying them. Although my experiences with Village House have not been the best so far, I will go again to try different things and see if their consistency improves. \n\nOverall I believe Village House has the potential to be a great, local dim sum place, but at this point I wouldn't recommend ordering any of the actual dumplings. It is a good place to bring a date for a small meal before seeing a movie at the theater down the street.

Believe it or not, you can subdivide those regions even further into an almost innumerable variety of regional cuisines. It's where two regions (and their unique cultures) overlap that you find some of the most magical food.\n\nWe came to the Richmond in search of Shanghainese food, and we found an even more specific variation of that cuisine, with influences of the Muslim culture from the western part of China, here at Village House. \n\nAs with most great Chinese eats in the US, you've gotta look past the recognizable items on the menu and dig to uncover the unique specialties of the house. I've gotten to the point where I can trust my gut (literally and figuratively) and we selected several dishes that let the true regionality shine including: \nShredded Pork with Bean Curd Skin, Ro Ja Moa (aka Chinese \"Hamburger\"), Cumin Lamb, Hot and Sour Potato, Chao Bing (stir fried shredded pancake with beef and bean sprouts), AND hand folded lamb and zucchini dumplings. \n\nHard to pick a favorite from that lineup because they all had their own unique merits, but I think I fell in love with the dish that sounds the simplest... hot and sour potato. Chinese chefs are masterful with their cleaver, and to julienne a potato by hand is no small feat. The uniformity in the cutting and cooking was truly impressive, and the sour and spicy sauce made this simple dish a beautiful marriage of flavor and texture that perfectly interrupted some of the richer dishes on the table. \n\nI'd have to say my second favorite was the shredded pork with bean curd skin. The shredded pork is coated in a glistening sweet sauce and set atop a pile of sliced cucumbers and bean sprouts, garnished with fresh cilantro and surrounded by squares of bean curd skin. As with many Chinese dishes, elements combine flavors and textures for the perfect bite, and in this one, the pork is so tender delicate that the bean curd adds in the chew while the veggies add in some freshness. \n\nLastly, you can't help but notice the prep area dedicated to dumplings here. These aren't the intricate Cantonese dim sum dumplings you might've enjoyed elsewhere, but rather these are simple, handmade, and comforting dumplings, quickly boiled and served with black vinegar for dipping. They seem to make them by the bushel, almost to order, and you should absolutely try them when you're here.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with this cuisine, I'd suggest repeating our order because it really hits some high notes. We were a party of three and ordered enough food for six, and yet our bill was still only $30/pp with tax and tip. I craved these flavors for the next few days.

I was probably drawn there by the fact thaat a Yelper had mentioned a \"Chinese hamburger\" and (correctly) assumed it was a roujiamo, but since it was past 5:00 when I got there I decided to make that the appetizer to  an early dinner. The young woman server was eager to promote the house-made xiaolong bao, dumplings (jiaozi) and noodles, so I ordered a basket of XLB and a lamb dumpling and noodle soup as my mains.\n\nThe roujiamo (\"Chinese Hamberger\" on the menu) was on the small side, but heck, it cost all of  $2.95. The panbread bun was about the right thickness, browned but not greasy, though a bit less dense than some versions. The meat filling was appropriately porky and salty in flavor, though the texture seemed wrong because  it was coarsely chopped (loin?) instead of stewed, so the sandwich was a bit dry as well.\n\nI don't know if they knew what they were getting into, boasting about their house-made xiaolong bao in earshot of both Shanghai Dumpling King and Shanghai House, but they didn't embarrass themselves.  Their XLB is probably better than the last I had at SDK, but not quite as good as I remember Shanghai House's to be (though I haven't been to either of these places in a long time). The wrappers were delicate, and the soup ample, though they need to push the needle away from the salty side of the dial a bit toward the sweet side. But then, those were Beijingese voices floating around the room, not Shanghainese.\n\nThe soup was hearty, with six lamb dumplings and a long ton of noodles.  The dumplings were meaty but not particularly lamb-y (but I'd like try them again, outside of soup, to be fair). The noodles were springy and fresh, if not hand pulled. The broth seemed under-seasoned, particularly lacking salt, of all things. Since there was no salt shaker of the condiment tray, I used a bit of soy sauce along with chili paste to sex it up.\n\nThe menu contains a lot that will be of interest to fans of Northern Chinese style \"dim sum.\" Chao bing was mentioned by a previous reviewer (in fact Village House has four versions), and they also have such relative rarities as sweet and savory shao bing (saobing), jian bing guozi, ji dan guan bing and doufu nao (which I'll definitely be back soon to try). In addition to other, more familiar  Northern Chinese fare, Village House's menu is augmented with a smattering of Shandong, Shanghainese, Xi'an, Sichuan and Xinjiang offerings.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Family really enjoyed the kou rou with preserved vegetables, dry fried chicken wings, Chinese hamburger, lamb dumplings, pot stickers, hot sour soup, braised beef noodles, beef stir fried shredded pancake with cabbage , sesame chicken among other dishes.\n", "Look forward to going down the menu and trying everything especially the Ma la hot dishes!

When I first walked in I was pleasantly surprised to find that they make all their dim sum fresh, right up front for everyone to see. The atmosphere of the place is nice as well. It's small, quiet, clean and pleasantly decorated. The staff is courteous and more than willing to answer any questions you may have. The size of the menu is decent for a place like this, but what's on the menu is fairly uninspired. There isn't much you won't find at any other generic Chinese-American restaurant. The real question is... is the food any good? \n\nI have been to Village House half a dozen times over the span of a few weeks to try and get a sense of quality and consistency. Unfortunately, they are one of the most inconsistent restaurants I have ever experienced. The dim sum has ranged from absolutely outstanding to a doughy, under-seasoned mess. the chicken dumpling with green chives is the only one that really blew my mind. The potstickers, which are typically one of my favorite dishes, were a total disappointment. They charge $5.95 for 4 doughy, flavorless pockets of disappointment. I can go to any number of other dim sum places and get 3 for around $2. The spicy dumplings, which were recommended to me as their most popular dish tasted okay, but made me feel ill later that day. Also, more than one my dishes were swimming in oil, which somewhat ruined it for me. Out of curiosity I tried the Chinese hamburger. It's simple and delicious. I just wish it had more filling. I would recommend it as a late-afternoon snack to anyone walking by looking for a quick bite to eat. My biggest complaint about this place isn't actually about the quality of the food it's the fact that everything is made to order, which in this case is actually a detriment to their business model. Dim sum restaurants are supposed to be fast and have small portioned, good quality dumplings at affordable prices. Village House doesn't really offer that. The prices are too high for the quality of food they provide and because everything is made to order, you have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes for even a single order of dim sum. I haven't tried any of their soups yet and I have seen quite a few people ordering it when they eat in the restaurant. They look quite good and I look forward to trying them. Although my experiences with Village House have not been the best so far, I will go again to try different things and see if their consistency improves. \n\nOverall I believe Village House has the potential to be a great, local dim sum place, but at this point I wouldn't recommend ordering any of the actual dumplings. It is a good place to bring a date for a small meal before seeing a movie at the theater down the street.

I was very wary when I saw a much bigger seating selection while Village House was remodeling, worried that it wouldn't have dim sum options and was purely a sit down place. However, it's looking like they're doing ready to go dim sum, at least a bit! It's definitely more of a sit down place and their ready made food is a little lacking in selection, but it's there and I'm hoping they expand on it more. \n\nRegardless, I've been there a couple times now and it's been pretty good! I was again worried that it would be a copycat of Shanghai Dumpling King across the street, but their menu is different enough that it works on its own. So far I've tried the chinese hamburger, ready made and fresh made pork dumplings, ready made fried rice, green onion pancake and beef pancake. The chinese hamburger was a little dry, but the flavor was definitely there! It's a bit spicy too. I feel like the buns were what was making it dry, as they were a bit thick and dense. I wasn't a huge fan of the ready made pork dumplings. They felt a bit bland to me, but somehow the ones I ordered that were made fresh were much better. Perhaps it was because they were hot?

The premade fried rice was very bland but I liked the addition of pineapple to it. I just threw in a bit of salt when I got home and it was better. The beef pancake has to be my favorite so far, though. It's the same kind of green onion pancake dough but wrapped almost crepe style around green onion, various green veggies, beef, cilantro and a really tasty sauce. \n\nPricewise it's pretty standard. Prices range between $2.50-$10. With how downhill Shanghai Dumpling King has been feeling, it's nice to have a good lunch option for a similar price point. \n\nThey don't have any music playing, but everyone is very friendly and the wait times for food aren't super long!

Curteous, quick and thoughful and with interesting menu and nice paper Chinese tales of dumpling and soup on the walls.  It is a Village House type simplicity replete with the classic linoleum and fluorescent lighting sf is known for :)).  House made Xiao Long Bao is ordered almost every time.  Chinese hamburger and pot stickers also good and fried but clean.  Bean paste with noodle is refreshing with raw veggies and satisfying with the pork bean paste and noodle (not house made noodle for this one but?).  The kung pao chicken is a sensation with the chili oil, whole peanut, celery, green pepper, onion, and a haunting after bite that leaves a tingle.  Numb face lamb soup at Mission Chinese only other place I've tried that has the same spice.
