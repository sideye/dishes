Caught a standup show a couple weeks ago, and just stopped in for a snack and a shot of Jameson. \n\nOn food, tried bangers and mash, exactly what I was looking for with bockwurst and mashed potatoes. So good. And just tried the sausage roll, expect a sausage, but it was more like ground sausage Ina pastry roll with savory sauce. Hit the spot.\n\nDon't expect a trendy experience, just a great neighborhood pub with solid food and drinks.
