It takes a lot to make me write a bad review, because any bad press drives down business.  The last thing a long established Mom and Pop owned kind of place needs is negative feedback, but after many years of getting food at Blue Iguana, my overall experience can only be called negative.  Worst of all, it's because they're socially disconnected. If it was just the food, I might not even bother to write a review. \n\nI used to work in the neighborhood and get food there after a long day of driving, and I'm still in the area several times a week.  Good thing El Pollo Supremo is right around the corner, I say.  They're the opposite: almost always good. \n\nIguana Azul started out good.  This was probably 15 years ago.  Then it was like they changed owners or something, or stopped caring about who they hired.  Over time I saw cooks who clearly didn't care about what they were doing.  Cashiers were almost always friendly, polite and even attractive ladies, but the food got worse and worse. \n\nWhen before the burritos used to be fresh, not sloppy and poorly put together, the last three times I have gone over a stretch of 3-4 months, but also long before that, I got probably the worst burritos I've ever had, and I was born and raised in the city.  I have had the best burritos and Mexican food, and at Blue Iguana, now I have had the worst.  Undercooked chicken?  Over cooked?  Scrap meat and grease piled from the grill?  Tons of water in the salsa?  Old ass guac?  Way too hot?  Torn flour tortillas and you still shoved a burrito together?  Check all of the above.  \n\nBut even worse, and likely related to all of the above?  Yeah, I'm gonna go there: the gringo treatment... when the cook sees who he's making it for and does the worst job he can, on purpose. Yeah, I'm a white guy.  Yeah, white privilege is a thing, especially in San Francisco (only since tech culture came up), but I'm not that guy.  I'm not one of the guys guiltily pretending to fit in and dressing down like I could be from here and I didn't out earn for your apartment, which magically became a condo. I'm a blue collar worker who has worked with people of every background and kind  for many years.  You think I don't know it when I see it?  I don't like the way white privilege is shaking down in the city or the Bay Area either, but I'm not going to take it out on you because you look like one of them.  Why did this restaurant?  Somebody wasn't paying attention to the character of the people they hired, or if they did, they took a wrong turn somewhere themselves.  \n\nSo I ban myself from Blue Iguana, boycott them by telling my friends why they should pass and now I have made my voice heard more publicly.  I hope you will take this into consideration before you pay them a visit.  My mistake was going back when the food kept getting worse and worse... for what?  No reason?  You can't fool me.

That said, I wouldn't go out of my way to find this place. The peeps behind the counter are friendly enough but not interested in chit chat. Know what you want before you step up to the counter and for God's sake people, the regular burrito does not come with cheese. Just like it says on the menu: rice, beans, salsa and choice of meat. You want cheese? Ask for it. Or better yet, get out of line and go to Taco Bell.\n\nI've had the carne asada, chicken, but never been brave enough for the carnitas (deep fried pork). I usually pop in here around 10:00 p.m. and at that time of day the meat is usually a little dry and pretty salty. I have a high tolerance for salt so I love it, but friends have said it's too much. The guacamole is good and freshly made, but be warned, towards the end of the night they sometimes run out.\n\nGood late night meal: One Regular Burrito with chicken, rice, black beans, and spicy salsa; one Tamarind soda; chips and a side of guacamole. This meal provides all the flavors one needs to end a meal: sweet, spicy, sour and savory.
