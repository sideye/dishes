They make the same kind of toasted bread, hot sub sandwiches with great toppings.  Even the menu board looks like the same font, perhaps done by the same person generations ago.\n\nA few notable differences:  \n- Larger seating area.  It has all of the charm of a church rec-room (no frills), but at least it's not crowded.  When I went, it was occupied by men in their late 30's/early 40's only.  Like the mafia-esque Men's Clubs that are all over Hoboken NJ (think Sopranos)\n- Two sizes of sandwiches, instead of 3.  Medium and Large.  Large is HUGE.  For $7.25 for a large, enough to feed two people, that's quite a bargain.\n- No jalapenos.  I panicked as my husband must have these on his cheese steak, and it's my job to make sure they're on there.  No worries!  They have a great home-made hot sauce  which is delicious and offers a very satisfying kick.\n- More chewy less crusty bread.  I actually liked the bread better than at the Submarine Shop, because the toasty bits didn't threaten to rip up my mouth at all.\n- They offer a Reuben, but without Thousand Island dressing.  To me, this means, they DON'T offer a Reuben.  A corned beef or pastrami sandwich?  Sure.\n- Fries.  I've read that they are good.  The fryer wasn't on (it was 4pm, so only me and the sandwich junkies were out getting sandwiches anyway).  I'll try these next time, and if they're good, I'll consider rounding up to 5 stars.\n- ATM at the entrance, right by the front door.

They make the same kind of toasted bread, hot sub sandwiches with great toppings.  Even the menu board looks like the same font, perhaps done by the same person generations ago.\n\nA few notable differences:  \n- Larger seating area.  It has all of the charm of a church rec-room (no frills), but at least it's not crowded.  When I went, it was occupied by men in their late 30's/early 40's only.  Like the mafia-esque Men's Clubs that are all over Hoboken NJ (think Sopranos)\n- Two sizes of sandwiches, instead of 3.  Medium and Large.  Large is HUGE.  For $7.25 for a large, enough to feed two people, that's quite a bargain.\n- No jalapenos.  I panicked as my husband must have these on his cheese steak, and it's my job to make sure they're on there.  No worries!  They have a great home-made hot sauce  which is delicious and offers a very satisfying kick.\n- More chewy less crusty bread.  I actually liked the bread better than at the Submarine Shop, because the toasty bits didn't threaten to rip up my mouth at all.\n- They offer a Reuben, but without Thousand Island dressing.  To me, this means, they DON'T offer a Reuben.  A corned beef or pastrami sandwich?  Sure.\n- Fries.  I've read that they are good.  The fryer wasn't on (it was 4pm, so only me and the sandwich junkies were out getting sandwiches anyway).  I'll try these next time, and if they're good, I'll consider rounding up to 5 stars.\n- ATM at the entrance, right by the front door.  If you are like me and constantly cash-less, this is a very nice convenience.\n\nI highly recommend:  Cheese Steak with everything + hot sauce, Italian Combo with everything.\n\nI do not recommend: the Veal Parmesan.  Blah.  Stick to the sliced meat sandwiches.\n\nService was East-Coast-style friendly.  Meaning, it was factual and to the point while we negotiated what they had vs. what I wanted.  Then, when business was concluded, we had a nice chat.  They greeted some customers by name, which I liked a lot.  \n\nThere is a big public parking lot up the street on 6th, which is extremely convenient as I've left this neighborhood more than once for lack of parking.\n\nNothing tastes better on a rainy and cold day than a warm, well-made, sandwich, esp when you are a bit *ahem* hung over from a fabulous party the night before (or so I HEAR ;) ).
