Ultra thick noodles with ruffled edges layered on top of each other with ground beef, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce in between. I liked it so much I made my own version for college potlucks. I only knew how to make lasagna and key lime pie.\n\nThat was my entire cooking repertoire as a Berkeley undergrad. But I digress since chef Massimo Di Sciullo creates his own unique version quite unlike what I've experienced. First, the handmade pasta is extremely thin like tissue paper. Six layers of this pasta are piled on top of each with three cheeses in between - not only mozzarella but also Parmigiano Reggiano and bechamel - and six variations of fillings and toppings in separate trays in the display case (photo: http://bit.ly/ZTa52W).

"], "author": "Evan R.", "review": "Admittedly, this lasagna is the main reason I created this Yelp account. This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten. Period. \n\nI have been here countless times. Each experience is equal to the last (I hate when people say better than the last, it detracts from all the other times they have gone). \n\nThat is the first question I asked myself as I entered this modest Father/Son Italian eatery was a simple one: What is a \"Lasagneria\"? \n\nKnowing the answer to this question is completely irrelevant. \n\nThere is no point in trying to find another \"Lasagneria\". This is the one. The only one. Marcella's wins. If you've eaten here you no longer need to search for any other lasagna anywhere ever. You want to google Lasagneria? \n\nI will save you some time. Your search will return Marcella's. And it isn't because other Lasagnerias don't exist. I am sure they do. It is because no other Lasagnerias in the area are relevant. \n\nA day may come when you think to yourself, \"What about that fun family Italian joint down the road?\"\n\nForget it. \n\nOr maybe you will think, \"How about that fancy Italian restaurant with a bunch of Michelin stars?\" \n\nNope. Wrong. The correct answer was go straight to Marcella's Lasagneria. This lasagna will blow you away. \n\nOkay. Breathe. Now to pair that with some evidence. \n\nService: Every time I come into Marcella's, I feel at home. G and Massimo treat every customer with care and respect. G often works the front end of the restaurant with other excellent servers like Rory. All of them are speedy, thoughtful, polite, and have a sense of humor. If you'd like to sit quietly in the back and shovel food into your mouth - you can. But I'd recommend striking up some conversation. \n\nAmbience: It's a Father/Son Italian eatery in the Dogpatch. It isn't Saison, but it has a uniquely charming atmosphere. You feel like you've been transported out of the normal SF hustle and bustle straight to an Italian eatery in Florence. Or maybe not. I haven't been to Italy so I wouldn't actually know. \n\nFood: \n\nI will review my personal favorite: The Bianca Lasagna\n\nLet's begin with the thinly prepared sheets of hand-crafted semolina pasta. Each pasta sheet is delicate, and about as thick as cardstock. The pasta is layered among creamy Bechamel sauce, pancetta, and a variety of herbs and possibly spices. The bottom sheet of pasta coalesces and crisps up with the cheese and pancetta creating a chewy and delicious foundation to the perfect slice of lasagna. \n\nAs you work you way through the block of fresh pasta, melted cheese, pancetta, and love, you may begin to question your morals. Should you take out the person next to you so you can eat whatever they ordered? Don't do it. That is murder and is extremely wrong and illegal. Instead, you should call over the waiter or waitress and order a tray to go. I have shamefully done that before. Except when I called, I pretended there was a party that night so G and Massimo wouldn't know the entire thing wasn't only me and pass silent, but visible judgement. \n\nAnyway, all their ingredients are incredibly fresh and delicious. This is arguably the best food I have eaten at this price point. Roughly $15-18 for the meal of dreams.\n\nMy only qualm is that they are not open on weekends. But that won't stop me and it shouldn't stop you. Just go there between 11:30am and 3:30pm on a weekday. Take a long lunch. Skip work and go here. Whatever.

The atmosphere indoors and outdoors (umbrella table seating) seems pretty Italian (looks and feels like it).  Wish it was open on the weekend, but right now the best thing to do is get take out of the Abruzzio (I've also tried the eggplant and the Bolognese) and take it up to some rooftop with a bottle of red wine.

First of all, they immediately sat me and were incredibly nice, which was very comforting being by myself and coming in from the rain. I was pretty hungry so I ordered the Caprese salad and the Ravioli al Tartufo. \n\nCaprese - The ingredients were clearly very fresh, and having the greens tossed in EVOO was great - I'm personally not a huge fan of balsamic with Caprese so it was a nice touch, along with the oregano on the mozzarella.\nRavioli - I tried so hard not to inhale it and savor it as much as I could because it was SO GOOD and extremely comforting on a cool, rainy day. The pasta itself was wonderful and the black truffle sauce was amazing with it. **Pro tip** if you get bread, use it to soak up any leftover sauce after you finish the pasta. \n\nEverything I had here was fantastic - even the bread! Also, the owners were so genuinely nice and took care of me very attentively. But the craziest part of all this?
