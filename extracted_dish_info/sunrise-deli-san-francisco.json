They are delicious just by themselves, and you can order 6 ($5) or 12 ($8) in a paper bag to go.  They are freshly cooked.  While the inside tastes pretty typical of a good falafel, it's the outside that is unique.  They have a great crunch, and I think they pick up a nice flavor from the oil they are cooked in.\n\nI ordered the Avocado Falafel in a Pita for $9.  It's served in a thin, cold pita, that can easily break open.  Other than the Falafel, the flavors of the other ingredients are just OK.  If I remember right, you get a total of 4 falafel as the pita is rather small.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would order some Falafel from Sunrise Deli, run a few blocks and ask Sabra Grill https://www.yelp.com/biz/sabra-grill-san-francisco to use those Falafel in their warm thick pita with all the trimmings.  That would taste great.\n\nI also tried a half pint of their Mujaddara (Rice and Lentils) for $5.  Though I really like most Mujaddaras, this was one of the worst.

It basically tasted like something that had been made a few days before and reheated.  Other than bulk, the Mujaddara added nothing to my meal, and I wish I had not ordered it.\n\nSo, on the strength of the Falafels, I'll give an overall rating of 3 stars.\n\n_______________\nOn another visit, I tried a small Lentil Soup for $5, and a Lamb Shawarma for $9.\n\nI really liked the lentil soup.  While a bit too salty for me, it had nice flavor.\n\nThe flavor of the Lamb in the Shawarma was OK; but, overall the Lamb was dry and the shawarma needed more flavor.  I tried adding hot sauce.

For some reason though, even though there was only one guy waiting for his food, we both waited for at least 20 minutes for our food. A true WTF moment.\nAfter I got my food (standard chicken plate with hummus and cucumber salad) I walked off to sit down, only to discover they forgot to include my falafels. I walked back and fortunately one of the staffers was in a jovial mood and wanted to give me more than I ordered, possibly because they were done for the day and closing. So, he gave me 6 falafels, 3 more than I paid for, along with an extra side of hummus. Bonus.\nThe food was, I have to say, excellent. It was definitely of food truck calibre, I thought. The hummus was too watery but it had a good creaminess and was not overly garlicky. The falafel was, as others have stated, the best. Crunchy non oily goodness. Slathered with hummus it is divine.\nThe chicken was very tasty. Not necessarily best I've had but not bad at all.

I'm Italian, okay?  If I don't get a certain quota of olive oil, I shrivel up and blow away.  While I don't consider Sunrise my fave, it has its own lovable quirks and specialties that keep me coming back.\n\nSunrise is not such a good place for groups, but if you're after an intimate-but-casual lunch for a friend or a fan of small spaces (I personally find them cozy!), there should be nothing stopping you from enjoying this ultra-casual setting for a sit-down meal.  And really, if you're working in SOMA or the FiDi and wearing a suit all day, doesn't it feel good to hunker down to a laminated table and stuff your pretty face with falafel?  Go ahead, I won't tell.  Oh, fine.  You can get it to go if you must.\n\nSpeaking of falafel, it's really some of the best I've had.  It's not greasy, but it is delightfully crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Like, creamier than any other falafel I've had.  This, of course, takes care of one of the issues one can take with falafel: it's just a lot of chickpea.  Sunrise adds in a couple other flavors to the mix to keep things interesting.  My personal favorite is the avocado falafel, and my boyfriend goes for the super falafel.  Point being, adding more fat and starch to your fat and starch is clearly the best way to go.  Their pitas are artfully arranged with just enough avocado (if that's your thing), a generous amount of tahini (or possibly a hummus-tahini mixture thing that's equal parts hummus, tahini, and awesome), and crunchy fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and what have you (the latter being a plant from the \"StuffnThings\" genus).  They also have super good pickled turnips.  Sound weird?  Eat it anyway, you'll like it.\n\nOne of the qualms I have is that Sunrise is not the best place to go if you're trying to eat healthily.  Since I almost always turn to Mediterranean fare when I'm looking to ingest something biologically helpful, its very existence seems a little oxymoronic to me.  Sure falafel is vegetarian, but if you're looking to eat veg and avoid the fried (yes, even lightly fried), your best bet is either to get a bunch of dips and pita (which is tasty, but doesn't really feel like a meal) or a veggie wrap (which is good but not the best, kind of deflating when you want a bit more of a selection).\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't swear off my other Mediterranean haunts, but when I want some mind-numbingly delicious falafel, pleasant service, and a phenomenally hobbit-hole-like dining experience, I go to Sunrise straight away.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Pickled turnips are great and always welcome.
