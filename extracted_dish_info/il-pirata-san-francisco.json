Pleasantly surprised.  \n\nWent the Sunday after Christmas, it was pretty dead inside - EXCEPT for a decent number of 49ers fans.  Had NO idea this place was a sports bar, guess it's not really, not sure what you'd classify it as actually, but it does have a good number of huge TVs for watching the game, and then also separate rooms w/ no TVs if that's not your thing. \n\nAs for the food, not the best I've ever had, some items better than others, but overall good experience.  Since we had the rest.com gift certificate we had to spend a minimum of $35 on food (pre-tax/tip).  At most SF places that's not difficult to do; here however, we ended up w/ 3 starters (steak bruschetta, classic salad, & wings) and two of the more expensive-ish entrees (chicken scallopini and chicken parm).   The bruschetta was a little oily for my taste but good.  Salad was really good, fresh, and a large portion.  The wings we just got to go b/c had so much food coming already (ate them the next day for lunch, pretty good, could have been hotter).  Both chicken dishes were good, nothing spectacular but met expectations (i.e. we weren't in North Beach and we knew that when we ordered, got what we expected). \n\nBest part of the meal were definitely the waitress (who I think was also the manager/owner?) and bartender.  Both seemed like great gals, knew the patrons coming in to watch the game by name, a good mood and smiling face can go a long way - particularly when eating a hungover lunch.  \n\nI think next time I'll come back for brunch, cheap menu with what looked like good cure for what ails you - pitchers of mimosas on an outdoor patio & pancakes would sure make me happy fast.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-02"}, {"excerpts": ["The Steak Bruschetta is equally amazing!
