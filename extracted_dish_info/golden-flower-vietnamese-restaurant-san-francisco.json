Its this spicy broth with pork blood and rice noodles. If pho was the sweet girl next door, Bun Bo Hue would be the cool, hipster chick that lives across the street. You get it once in a while to get that extra flavor and kick. I prefer to get this noodle soup with the PHO noodles and not rice noodles because this noodle soup is suppose to have a lot of flavor but I think rick noodles don't soak up the flavor as well as the pho noodles; up to you. \n\nVermicelli: If you really feel like a skinny gal tonight, order this. Its basically a bed of lettuce coupled with mints and sprouts with a bundle of dry vermicelli blanketed with sweet, fish Vietnamese sauce. You can order it with spring rolls on top or bbq or shrimp....(list goes on and on...) I must say, you have to ask for another thing of sauce, its simply not enough or else your noodles will be too dry. This is basically a light noodle salad( but it will fill up)!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-09-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Stopped by this relatively spacious place (for chinatown) for some pho and bun bo hue.

(\"Low Fan\", or \"outsider\" version though!)\n\nThis one benefits from being on the now busy lower Jackson street corridor in Chinatown. It's busy because Obama once ducked into the Great Eastern for Chinese food, and this has seemed to create a tourist frenzy that has spilled over to nearby establishments, even if they are Vietnamese. The fat tourists don't have to walk up the hills to Grant or Stockton on the verge of a heart attack to get here. And it is closer to FiDi.\n\nIt is narrow and long, with 3 rows of tables, quatres on the sides, community or quatres in the middle. The cashier counter is in the rear. \n\nI ordered Pho Tai Bo Vien, which is rare beef slices (Tai) with beef balls (Bo Vien). No, they weren't balls from cattle, they are little meatballs you can buy at any Ranch 99 market, and popular in Pho. \n\nThe broth was pretty clear, a good sign that flavor was cooked in, not added artificially. Still, i like a little more hint of anise in my broth, and this had a little more sour taste than many. It came out quickly and the condiments were fresh. The noodles were al dente, which was different, because many places over cook them and they become mushy and milky. \n\nThe owner is from Central Vietnam. She lived in Pleiku, Da Nang, Hue, and Nha Trang. Central Vietnam, or the Highlands region, is mountainous, cooler, and the food is spicier. Hue is the ancient capital near the old DMZ. Da Nang is popular with honeymooners due to cooler and pretty scenery. Pleiku was a US Air Base during the Vietnam war. Nha Trang (actually not quite central, more north part of South) is now a top tourist destination with a beautiful beach and a recent world beauty pageant held there. \n\nThe signature noodle dish from Central is Bun Bo Hue, a hearty stew like, spicy noodle soup with just about everything thrown in. Since the owner is from Central, I would suggest trying the Bun Bo Hue if you like that dish.   \n\nThe fact that this and the other Viet places in Chinatown are all called Golden something gives a hint that, although from Vietnam, these people may be part of the large Chinese diaspora that resided in Vietnam. Most Vietnamese Vietnamese places are named after a city (like those mentioned above, or Saigon, Vung Tau, My Tho and many others) or after an important year in history, like Pho 54 (1954, the year a young general named Ho Chi Minh defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu), or after the Vietnamese family, like Vien Huong, Huynh Hiep, and many others. (This would be like Tony Roma's, etc.) \n\nThe Vietnamese restaurants with names like Golden something in English, or Kim something something in Vietnamese (Pho Kim Long), are often Chinese-Vietnamese. They could be diaspora for generations, so it often doesn't show up in the food, and especially to the American or non-Vietnamese. But sometimes it does.\n\nBut perhaps they are called Golden something for the American tourists to remember, and for good luck. Most tourists from the midwest not exposed to Vietnamese food will still come into a restaurant like this looking for Chow Mien and fried rice. At least they can get egg rolls. (Cha Gio, pronounced Cha Yaw) and spring rolls (Goi Cuon, pronounced Goy Koon). \n\nVietnamese, like Chinese, is a Tonal language, so getting the pronunciation is only half the battle. The tone of each word is critical to the meaning. Their are 6 ways to say \"Ba\" in Vietnamese, and depending on the tone, it means 6 different things.  \n\nAlthough big brother to the north (China) has meddled with Vietnam through the ages, the Chinese in Vietnam were discriminated against as a minority, not unlike the other minorities in the region, like the Hmong, Mien, and others. In Saigon (Now Ho Chi Minh City), there was a specific large ghetto in the city called Cho Lon (still there) that is the Chinese district.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-07-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered a small Pho Tai here and it was hard not to like it.

"], "author": "Wanugee N.", "review": "Well just like the Koreans taking over Japantown, the Vietnamese are taking over Chinatown, just more slowly. \n\nThis is the third Pho (pronounced Fa-uh) restaurant I have eaten at in Chinatown, and funny, they are all named Golden something. (That would be \"Kim\" something in Vietnamese)\nAnd it is the 113th or 114th Pho Noodles restaurant I have eaten in and reviewed! (I lose count, there are so many!) Call me a Pho King Noodle expert! (\"Low Fan\", or \"outsider\" version though!)\n\nThis one benefits from being on the now busy lower Jackson street corridor in Chinatown. It's busy because Obama once ducked into the Great Eastern for Chinese food, and this has seemed to create a tourist frenzy that has spilled over to nearby establishments, even if they are Vietnamese. The fat tourists don't have to walk up the hills to Grant or Stockton on the verge of a heart attack to get here. And it is closer to FiDi.\n\nIt is narrow and long, with 3 rows of tables, quatres on the sides, community or quatres in the middle. The cashier counter is in the rear. \n\nI ordered Pho Tai Bo Vien, which is rare beef slices (Tai) with beef balls (Bo Vien). No, they weren't balls from cattle, they are little meatballs you can buy at any Ranch 99 market, and popular in Pho. \n\nThe broth was pretty clear, a good sign that flavor was cooked in, not added artificially. Still, i like a little more hint of anise in my broth, and this had a little more sour taste than many. It came out quickly and the condiments were fresh. The noodles were al dente, which was different, because many places over cook them and they become mushy and milky. \n\nThe owner is from Central Vietnam. She lived in Pleiku, Da Nang, Hue, and Nha Trang. Central Vietnam, or the Highlands region, is mountainous, cooler, and the food is spicier. Hue is the ancient capital near the old DMZ. Da Nang is popular with honeymooners due to cooler and pretty scenery. Pleiku was a US Air Base during the Vietnam war. Nha Trang (actually not quite central, more north part of South) is now a top tourist destination with a beautiful beach and a recent world beauty pageant held there. \n\nThe signature noodle dish from Central is Bun Bo Hue, a hearty stew like, spicy noodle soup with just about everything thrown in. Since the owner is from Central, I would suggest trying the Bun Bo Hue if you like that dish.   \n\nThe fact that this and the other Viet places in Chinatown are all called Golden something gives a hint that, although from Vietnam, these people may be part of the large Chinese diaspora that resided in Vietnam. Most Vietnamese Vietnamese places are named after a city (like those mentioned above, or Saigon, Vung Tau, My Tho and many others) or after an important year in history, like Pho 54 (1954, the year a young general named Ho Chi Minh defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu), or after the Vietnamese family, like Vien Huong, Huynh Hiep, and many others. (This would be like Tony Roma's, etc.) \n\nThe Vietnamese restaurants with names like Golden something in English, or Kim something something in Vietnamese (Pho Kim Long), are often Chinese-Vietnamese. They could be diaspora for generations, so it often doesn't show up in the food, and especially to the American or non-Vietnamese. But sometimes it does.\n\nBut perhaps they are called Golden something for the American tourists to remember, and for good luck. Most tourists from the midwest not exposed to Vietnamese food will still come into a restaurant like this looking for Chow Mien and fried rice. At least they can get egg rolls. (Cha Gio, pronounced Cha Yaw) and spring rolls (Goi Cuon, pronounced Goy Koon). \n\nVietnamese, like Chinese, is a Tonal language, so getting the pronunciation is only half the battle. The tone of each word is critical to the meaning. Their are 6 ways to say \"Ba\" in Vietnamese, and depending on the tone, it means 6 different things.  \n\nAlthough big brother to the north (China) has meddled with Vietnam through the ages, the Chinese in Vietnam were discriminated against as a minority, not unlike the other minorities in the region, like the Hmong, Mien, and others. In Saigon (Now Ho Chi Minh City), there was a specific large ghetto in the city called Cho Lon (still there) that is the Chinese district.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-07-21"}], "pho tai nam": [{"excerpts": ["I had pho tai nam ", "and my wife had seafood pho.

In an attempt to save money and eat at home more, we were driving home through Chinatown when \"Golden Flower Pho!\" popped into both our heads.  It was 9:10pm and we didn't know if they closed at 9:30pm so we drove quickly and found rockstar parking half a block down the street.  There were still customers inside but when we got to the door, the sign read \"9:00am - 9:00pm\".  We stepped in anyway and the proprieter lady waved us to a table (YAY!)  We'd been here once before and eaten something other than the pho so this time we went straight for the pho:  #7: rare steak and beef balls LARGE for me and Pho Ga - chicken pho for him, also LARGE.\n\nTea was served immediately and about 5 minutes later, 2 giant, steaming, bowls of pho were placed in front of us.  \n\nI don't know how they do it, the beef pho had abotu 6 good-looking pieces of steak, pink in the middle and lots of large beef balls.  The soup was so comforting and really hit the spot.  Of course, I topped it with beansprouts, lemon and peppers and sprinked the Siracha over the soup.\n\nI hate it when meat has dangly bits of fat and tendons and other oddities on it but the meat in both our bowls was nice and clean.  There was a generous amount of shredded chicken in the Pho Ga and some lettuce which would have been really good if there wasn't some brown bits on the edge - we picked that out.\n\nSoon the restaurant started to clear out, the proprieter making conversation with the last trickle of customers.  As they cleaned up, we hurried to finish our piping hot soup - but she called out to us to take our time and even topped up our water glasses (all past closing time!!)\n\nI love this place for having delicious, comforting broth: slightly sweet and really tasty and for being near to home.  I also like that they keep it relatively clean (sweeping the floor and wiping the chili bottles at the end of the day) and there is obviously lots of heart put into the restaurant.\n\nI would come here 3 times a week - if I got home in time. :)  at a previous visit, my husband got the 5 spice chicken which came with a bowl of soup noodles.  The bbq chicken was served on the side and was a fine piece of thigh meat: a never ending supply of relatively lean and clean chicken served on a lettuce leaf.
