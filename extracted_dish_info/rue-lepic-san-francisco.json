"], "author": "cindy w.", "review": "OK...I'm a little bias regarding this restaurant.\n\nI ABSOLUTELY love this restaurant and used to eat ther almost every other night, since I lived a block from there.\n\nFirst, this is no fancy place, it's a small quaint little french bistro, seats about 35ppl.  There's no fancy decoration, but there is a life size potrait of the owner.  I'm not sure of the spelling of her name, but it's something like, Mischiko. She's japanese.  Mischiko studied in Europe and came back to SF to open Rue Lepic.  She buys the meats and produce fresh daily.\n\nI always get the fixed chef's menu ($49.50/ person).  With this pricing, you get a seafood pasta appetizer, soup of the day, salad, a full size main entree and the piece de resistance....DESSERT!  I highly recommend LES ESCARGOTS A LA PROVENCALE  (if you are into snails, which I am), it has the best sauce, LE FILET DE SAUMON SAUTE A L'ANETH (salmon) or LE CARRE D'AGNEAU ROTI (Lamb) for the main entree and then dessert: LES FRUITS DESAISON SUR UN LIT DE CREME ANGLAISE! It's so Yummi!\n\nThis is a GREAT french restaurant at an AMAZING price.\n\nBon Appetit!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-05-15"}], "la ganache au chocolat nappee dune creme anglaise parfumee aux fraises et kiwis": [], "creme brulee garnie de fraises": [], "mousse aux fruits de la passion avec un coulis de fraises et de kiwis": [], "sorbet de peche avec de fraises et de kiwis": []}
