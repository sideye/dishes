I think we've all had our fair share of Panda experiences. We know the menu, we understand what we're paying for, and we take the risk of our bodies hating us directly afterward. If you read my reviews, you might notice a recurring theme- not only do I enjoy nice dinners with quality wine and a bill that makes you cringe, but I also love late night junk food excursions. I enjoy the best of both worlds!\n\nI've always held Panda Express in a higher regard within the \"junk food\" realm. On par with In N Out. It's junky, it's low brow, but it's delicious and hits the spot. Unfortunately, this location of Panda missed that for me. \n\nThe Orange Chicken, which I remembered to be delicious and crunchy, was soggy. The Walnut Shrimp that I had remembered to be oh so delicious, was horribly fishy (I couldn't even finish it, which is a big deal for me). My fried rice was overcooked and barely edible. My divine memories of being dropped off at the mall when I was 14 just to eat Panda with my friends suddenly faded. Was it all a lie?\n\nThank god my chicken egg roll was actually REALLY GOOD or I would have ran out of place in hysterics. So much so that I went up and got a few more. But, as for my actual entrees.. All I have to say is Yikes.

I'd even called the first thing the following morning to report the issue so no other customers would get ill. \n\nFlash forward 4 years: I went today and it was as expected.
