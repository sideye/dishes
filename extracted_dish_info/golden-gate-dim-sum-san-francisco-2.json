"], "author": "Wendy H.", "review": "3/19/08 Update:\n\nOk we finally got around to having dinner here.  We did take out and we also ate in.  \n\nTake out:  We ordered Peking pork chop, tofu sole hot pot, green beans and green onion chicken. That qualified us for free delivery.  \n\nDelivery was fast and food came out hot.  Food was pretty good.  Portions are a bit on the small side.  Would do take out again.\n\nEat in Dinner:  After testing out their dinner food, I made reservations for a table in the patio room for a family dinner.  This was an early dinner (5:30).  The hostess the reservation wasn't a problem.  \n\nHowever, when we got there, they told us that a bunch of people (who's been eating since 2 PM!?!?) is still squatting on our reserved table.  They did not have the heart or were gutless to kick these losers out of our table.  Upon inspection, those people weren't even eating.  They were squatting at the table chit chatting (how to ya like that?).  \n\nThe other tables in the patio room were reserved for other people at 7 (huh, we came at 5:30, how come we can't have one of those?  We're super fast eaters!) so they didn't want to offer those tables to us.  The waiter offered the ones in the front room but my folks complained about the room being drafty (it is cold w/ the door opening and closing).  \n\nFinally, they made a makeshift table of 10 for us in the hallway connecting the front room to the patio room (the hallway were tables of 4 are located).  Unfortunately, that meant we were squeezed together in the table cuz one side of the table is flushed against a wall (so no on can sit there!).  They also gave us a bum lazy susan that literally moves across the table when you spin it!.\n\nReally for all our discomfort and inconvenience (remember, we had a reservation!), you'd think they'd give us a discount or throw in some free food. Nada.  We got zilch!  They just apologized and said we'll make it up to you next time.  Really, I don't know how you're gonna make it up to us since there's no documentation of what ya did and you didn't promise a free dish or anything like that!\n\nFood was ok but on the small portioned side.\n\nOh yeah, we finished and left before that 7:00 PM reservation for the remaining patio room tables arrived.  So ya see, we would have vamoosed it before anyone showed up.  We have some consideration!\n\nThose damn squatters on our reserved table were still sitting around and NOT EATING by the time we left.\n\nBased on the poor dinner service, I'm deducting a star (I'm being generous too!).  Come here for the dim sum.  Don't come here for dinner.\n\n*********************************\n\nI heard about this new restaurant via Chowhound so I decided to take the parents for lunch here.  This is a little bit off Clement St (a couple of  blocks past Park Presidio to be exact, between 19th & 20th Avenue).\n\nRestaurant is very spacious and clean.  They sat us in the back, indoor patio section.  There's a real nice koi filled fountain beyond the patio that you can go out and look at the Koi.  Several of the patrons actually went out and got a smoke there.\n\nThere are no carts.  Service is given via a check list.  I prefer this because the food comes out hot.  Dim sum is excellent.  My folks raved about how the Chicken Feet were the best they've had in a long time.  That's saying something cuz they always complained about the chicken feet.\n\nWe also ordered a plate of vegetarian chow mein.  That was pretty yummy too.\n\nThe food was done just right.  Not too salty.\n\nService was excellent.  The staff checked back to see how you were doing and you were profusely thanked on your way out the door.\n\nDim sum prices $2-$4.50.  Pretty reasonable considering the Banquet costs a bit more and food is mediocre at best.\n\nThis isn't just a dim sum house because they serve dinner too.  Based on the menu, I'd say the prices are pretty good.  Gotta go back to eat dinner here one of these days.\n\nParking is the only thing that sucks.  It's very difficult to find parking although I noticed they had the front of their restaurant marked off for customers so I guess if you have a big party, they'd save you 2 spots.\n\nGo ahead, check it out.

Aside from the churng funs, go with anything shrimp. I usually don't like the ha gao, BUT for some reason theirs taste good!! I think it's because they actually de-vein (poop) the shrimp so it doesn't feel as yeucky. Their shrimps are nice and crunchy.

Just a little note that they charge extra $0.50 per plate for dim sum during dinner hours. \n\nThe dim sum was okay, not great... Definitely not as good as HK Lounge... For example, the egg yolk buns  did not have the 'oozing' effect when you split the bun in half and the Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) were pretty dry; there was no soup/ juice when you bite into the skin.. We did enjoy the steamed pork buns and the steamed sweet cake though. \n\nThe quality of service was below my expectations. I have to admit their service was prompt but their warped logic was a little too much for us... We actually ordered steamed pork buns and they served us chicken buns, telling us that 'oh, these are chicken buns in replacement of the pork buns.' and left. We were baffled, thinking that they probably ran out of steamed pork buns and hence the replacement.. but they didn't check with us if we wanted the replacement (which a usual restaurant would if they ran out of something, no?). So I asked if they ran out of steamed pork buns. I was stunned by their reply -- \"Oh we steamed the wrong buns so we gave you the chicken buns.

Previous orders have included:\n\nFebruary 2013:\nEgg rolls ($2)\nSteamed beef balls ($2)\nTaro cake with chinese sausage ($2)\nDeep fried stuffed dumplings ($2)\nSteamed chicken feet ($2)\nSteamed pork dumplings ($2)\nSteamed pork spareribs ($2)\nSteamed house dumplings ($2.50)\nHouse steamed shrimp dumplings ($2.50)\nSteamed pea sprout dumplings ($2.50)\nSteamed stuffed tofu skin rolls ($2.50)\nShrimp rice noodle rolls ($3)\nSticky rice with lotus leaf ($3)\nSteamed beef tripe ($4.50)\nBeef tripe with turnip ($4.50)\n\nDecember 2012:\nPan fried turnip cake ($2)\nSteamed pork dumplings ($2)\nSteamed egg custard bun ($2)\nSteamed bbq pork bun ($2)\nSteamed beef balls ($2)\nPan fried pot stickers ($2.50)\nSteamed Shanghai dumplings ($2.50)\nHouse steamed shrimp dumplings ($2.50)\nSteamed scallops dumplings ($2.50)\nSteamed stuffed tofu skin rolls ($2.50)\nShrimp rice noodle rolls ($3)\nSticky rice with lotus leaf ($3)\nSteamed beef tripe ($4.50)\nClam with black bean sauce ($4.50)\nShrimp dumpling soup ($4.50)\nFREE Chicken chow mein\n\nTheir dim sum is pretty average. The staple dishes such as the har gow, shu mai, chicken feet, spareribs, noodle rolls, sticky rice in lotus leaf, etc are good enough to satisfy my dim sum craving when I'm too lazy to go out. And for the prices, I can still order all the dishes I want! 3 stars for the food, but bumping it up to 4 stars since they deliver!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-06-20"}, {"excerpts": ["* Fried Shrimp Dumpling: ", "A little greasy.

Initially, we were heading towards Hong Kong Lounge but after seeing the line, we decided to go elsewhere. And that's how we were brought here. I actually just found this place by mistake. \n\nI was lured in by the shorter line & pricing. We waited a few minutes to be seated. I was so surprised to see that the dishes were so cheap! From $2.50-$3.25!!! Specialty dishes were priced at $5.50...but not bad.\n\nThe restaurant was packed! So I was assuming it was good. So we marked on the little paper provided ehat we wanted and gave it to the waitress. \n\nService:\n\nIt's really not the best. They sorta ignore you and have to wave them down for something. I had to ask 3 times for my water to come. The guy was pretty attentive though when clearing our dishes. But we waited 20-25mins for our food to come out. Idk if it was because it was a holiday?\n\nFood:\n\n* Siumai: Standard. A little smaller than usual but served hot. Also it was pretty moist. \n* Har Gow: Good size. The skin was a little sticky but othereise delicious. \n* Chicken Feet (NOT PICTURED): Was tender yet had an overpowering anise flavor. But not bad for the price.\n* Shrimp and Chive: Delicious filling but the wrapper was also sticky. We finished it though.\n* Fried Shrimp Dumpling: A little greasy. But otherwise standard.\n* Steamed Spareribs: I've had better. But it cured my craving.\n* Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf (NOT PICTURED): Lots of filling. Served hot.\n* Steamed Tofu Roll (NOT PICTURED): Kept falling apart. Not too much flavor.\n* Fried Sesame Ball  (NOT PICTURED): Good but a little softer than I'm used to. A little greasy as well.\n* Fried Shrimp Roll (NOT PICTURED): Ehh. Greasy. Slightly burnt.\n* Foil Wrapped Chicken: I guess I'm not a big fan of five-spice. The chicken was moist though.\n\nOverall I would come back if I was in the area and Hong Kong Lounge had a long line again. Not the best dim sum in the world but it also depends on what you order. I loved how the dishes were always served hot. Not bad for a quick fix. Pretty cheap too. All of the dishes ee ordered rounded up to $39.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-12-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Pan fries chives dumpling\nSteamed shrimp dumpling (this was ok)\nPan fried pot stickers (amazing)\nSteamed BBQ pork buns (delish)\nStuff crab claws with shrimp\n\n"], "author": "Kuanie J.", "review": "This place is open on Sunday morning for dim sum!!!

We headed to Chinatown every week and ate at one of those huge tea houses way back when.  They used to count the plates at the end of our meal before the whole stamp system came along.  Carts were the norm.  \n\nThese days, tiny restaurants can also service those looking for dim sum without all the fuss.  As a result, there are no carts being pushed and instead, you have a menu that you pencil in how many of each item you want.  (Good for those who know their dim sum, bad for newbies.)  \n\nWhat makes Golden Gate Dim Sum a great steal?  Their Monday through Friday (10:30 am to 3:00 pm) dim sum prices at $1.90/plate.  These account for their small, medium, and large plates.  My retired parents know all about these places and frequent them quite a bit.  Word gets around at the senior centers.  They know they want to be seated downstairs, and they have to ask that all the food not come out at once.

I guess not because we were ignored for ten minutes (I even got to get into a long discussion about anatomy) while sitting on the chairs for waiting and then they made us feel stupid and made a gesture and face that indicated we were stupid for not knowing we just go in and sit. I realize it was a mistake on my end but they could have handled it better because there's a fucking sign that says WAIT TO BE SEATED. Secondly, I don't know what we did to piss the waiters off but they were rude right off the bat. When giving us our food the waiter simply and literally just propped the plates on the table almost in an aggressive manner (the plates made a loud clank when he just dropped the food and utensils on the glass surface) looking flustered walking away angrily. I felt so hurt! haha, We wait a while, then 2 big groups of people came in. Our waiter was so nice to the chinese group that walked in, definitely looked happier than with us and was clearly giving them way nicer treatment, I guess just because they can speak chinese or something like that, a cultural habit that's inevitable I guess. The other table was a bunch of kids that looked like Lowell High students looking for a bite to eat after studying for hours on end. I turn around and even though our waiter took good care of the chinese group next to us the hs kid group remained unattended. I heard them complaining saying how ridiculous the wait to order was. (On a very UNIMPORTANT, DON'T EVEN BOTHER READING side note, f*** that group of HS elite overachievers, they were mocking my pre med books and saying shit like \"ohhhh big deal anyone can learn anatomy\"SMHSMHSMH) \n\nThe food is the only reason I didn't give them just one star. We had:\n\nHoney Walnut Prawns (tasted good, yet standard...you can get $5.00 same quality at this chinese restaurant on union) \nDuck (mmm, so succulent, really good, duck is always fantastic)\nSauteed Tofu with black mushroom (for you filipinas, the tofu tasted like TAHO! not a good thing this was probably the worst tofu dish I've ever had. I was so frustrated because tofu dishes never disappoint ever, how do you fcuk up tofu!??! The sauce was bland and if you closed your eyes you wouldn't be able to tell if you were eating mushroom or tofu, maybe the black mushroom was made out of tofu.) \nThai Ice Tea (tasted like chocolate [: ) \n\nI guess I liked that the menu was 5 pages of everything you could ever want at a chinese restaurant, it took like 10 minutes looking at everything trying to decide because it all looked so good, the descriptions and pictures did anyway, definitely doesn't apply to the actual piping hot plate you get :p\n\n$40.00 for two people and three items and rice. WHAAAATAHELL, AND IT WASN'T EVEN GOOD. Everything we had could have been a $20.00 meal at an EVEN BETTER neighboring chinese restaurant I imagine, I mean S.F. is adorned with them, in fact I bet I would have, no wait, I HAVE HAD better at the $1 an item Chinese restaurant on 24th and mission.
