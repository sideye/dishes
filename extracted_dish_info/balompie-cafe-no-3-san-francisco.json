Both the steak and shrimp were good, especially when I put some salsa and the coleslaw stuff on it, but nothing fantastic.  They weren't greasy, but there was a little too much cheese for my taste, and I wished they had more flavor before I put the toppings on them.  The spicy vegetables served in a side dish were really good - especially the cauliflower.\n\nIt was a good meal and friendly service, but I'd probably try out a different pupuseria before coming back here again.\n\nOh, and to comment about the other review I saw about a hair in the food - all of the cooks were wearing hairnets the night I was there, so hopefully no more hairs in the food!  :-)", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-06-08"}], "pupusas con casamiento": [], "chicken breast grilled onions": [], "chicken stew": [], "breaded chicken": [], "spaghetti with chicken in tomato sauce": [], "grilled chicken and shrimp": [], "steak with grilled onions": [], "breaded beef steak": [], "grilled beef steak": [], "salvadoran beef steak and red sauce": [], "beef tongue in red sauce": [], "beef tongue in grilled onions": [], "shredded beef with egg": [], "shredded beef with vegetables": [], "oxtail in tomato sauce": [], "grilled steak and shrimp": [], "grilled red snapper": [], "grilled shrimp": [{"excerpts": ["The pastel (like an empanada) we chose had chicken  and our yuca was steamed and came with grilled shrimp. \n", "The pupusa was very flavorful, but a little oily for my taste.

So when she makes it a point to recommend a little place located on the quiet side of Mission Street you must heed her words of wisdom and make your way there.\n\nBalompie 3 is an absolute gem of a restaurant. The minute you walk in you are greeted by the super friendly staff. The restaurant is clean and decorated with futbol memorabilia on the walls and two large flat panel televisions on either mounted high on the walls where you can catch a glimpse of the River Plate and Boca Junior game in high definition. \n\nThe dining room is small, yet spacious and open. The kitchen is clearly visible from most of the tables where you can spot your breakfast order being freshly and prepared by experts in El Salvadoran cuisine. The menu is authentic and all your favorites are included. On this Saturday morning, three of sat down to feast on as much as we could and sampled each others choices. My wife went with the huevos con chorizo, this dish is served with refried beans and rice. The eggs were perfect and not overcooked. The flavors of all the ingredients were shining and my wife throughly enjoyed her meal. I went with the Number 19, plantains with crema and refried beans. This dish is served with a little cube of goat cheese which I am telling you right now, do not overlook this tiny little box of cheese goodness. Sprinkle a little on your beans as the saltiness of the cheese combined with the richness of the beans are a match made in Heaven. I also got an extra side of eggs over medium which helped round out the dish. \n\nMy wife and split an order of papusas, one bean and cheese and pork and cheese. Both were delicious, but surprisingly we agreed that we preferred the bean and cheese. A word of warning, these things are filling and even after 5 hours am still completely stuffed and cannot ever imagine eating again.\n\nA nice selection of salsa, cabbage and pickled jalepenos and carrots accompanied our food along with a side of thick hand made corn tortillas. I also made certain that a bottle of Tapatio sauce was brought over which I then used to sprinkle on my beans. \n\nThe service is excellent and the waitstaff made sure that our coffee cups were always warm and water glasses always filled to the rim.

Um, yeah I've been eating there since I was 2 years old.  Sure.  Yeah, that's it. . 2 years old. . . \n\nAnyway in the battle of pupusa greatness, to me, Balompie #1 has always come out on top over Panchita's, Zocolo and La Santaneca.    The fillings are always abundant and the dough is always tender and not greasy.  Their curtido is balanced and tasty.   Also, their caldo de pollo is my  I-am-so-sick-I-want-my-mommy therapy.\n\nThe only draw back of Balompie #1 is that it is ALWAYS crowded and the seats are packed in tight so you always feel cramped or rushed or infringed upon . . ..Balompie #3 is small but the tables are spaced well so that won't be a problem.  \n\nThe restaurant has only been open for three weeks and they are offering a fairly limited menu (compared to Balompie #1).  The star of the menu are the pupusas.  They have your usual suspects - cheese, revueltas, loroco, ayote, etc.  They also have \"Specialty\" pupusas. . .three with the stomach churning combo of fish, shrimp and cheese - not my cup of tea but three other ones - the Mejicana (sic) which is a mixture of ground pork, jalapenos, & cheese; the Italiana which is prosciutto and cheese and the Gringa which is seasoned ground beef and cheese.    They offer both the corn masa and the rice masa. . .my boyfriend likes the rice masa so he always gets those. . .I  much prefer corn masa.  He got the chicharron and queso (revueltas) in rice masa and I got the Mejicana in corn masa.  I also got an Italiana because, well, I had to. . . it sounded bizarre enough to work.  Being the fromage-o-phile that I am you must understand that what I am about to say goes against the very fiber of my being. . .the pupusas were good but not great because. . . .are you sitting down?. . . .there was TOO MUCH cheese in them.  I know.  Crazy talk.   But the balance was thrown by all that cheese.  I was piling on the curtido to balance out the richness of the cheese.  Also, the pupusas broke which isn't such a tragedy because the crispy cheese ooze is such a bonus but ALL of them were broken and mis-sized so their are a couple of consistency problems (see my pics).  But I did really like the mejicana - the combo was good and I liked the jalapenos and the nice kick they added.  So how about that Italiana?  It was GENIUS!  Seriously delicious. . .a good amount of prosciutto but not so much as to be overwhelmingly salty, cheese (not too much in this one) and fresh oregano leaves. . it worked.  My dream would be to have a couple of those with two fried eggs atop. . .it would be the breakfast of champions!  As stated earlier, Balompie #1 as the best curtido and that is true here as well. . also make sure to get some escabeche - theirs is so good!  We also had a side of casamiento which was a tad dry.   They are frying up fresh chips and they are delicious and the salsa, which is traditionally very low key - here it is actually quite good.  We also had some jamaica which was very, very good - not too sweet but not bitter or tart either - it went perfectly with our meal.  \n\nI went again last night to get a quick bite and had the Gringa which was very good - this time not too much cheese but a little greasy from the ground beef.  But good.\n\nI am excited to know that they will be open until midnight on Friday and Saturdays - you just never know when you might be overwhelmed by a desire for pupusas and now at least their is a fairly late night option out there.   \n\nSo why only three and a half stars?  Well . .. one thing is that they charge different prices for eating there or to go.  It's weird and off-putting.  Their menu is limited - I will update this review when they add a few more items - especially my beloved caldos and if you sit in the front two window tables at sundown you will hate your life. . .it's hot, bright and you have to eat wearing sunglasses - please my darling friends at Balompie #3 - get some shades for those windows!
