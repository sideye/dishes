My friend and I ordered potato garlic soup, Lardon and Frisee salad, pastured beef sliders, and Tuscan Steak Salad.  The soup was decent, fairly smooth, but not much potato consistency and flovrs were bland.  The soup was served with a few slices of toasted bread.  The Lardon and Frisee salad was very dissappointing.  The salad had no frisee, the lardons were just bacon slices, and the poached egg was leaking.  To make matters worse, the dressing was tasteless.  I am a big fan of this classic french salad that brings together contrasting ingredients and combines them in a tantalizing way.  This salad did not do justice to the real thing.  The beef sliders used the wrong bread, instead of mini rolls, they used baggettes sections which were very tough to chew, and made eating the burger a chore.  The beef was under seasoned and not very flavorful.  the burger looked nothing like the picture on the restaurant's website.  Also a very dissappointing dish.  Finally, the Tuscan Steak sandwich.
