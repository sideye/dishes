The kitchen is closed.\" No apologies, just flat out denial. \n\n\"If at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again.\" Right? Right. So now I'm back and this time we arrived earlier and were seated right away. We sat in the back of the restaurant which was quite disappointing because the room was too dark. I struggled to read the menu and enjoy the food since our table was only lit by a tiny candle. One star down.\n\nWhen it came to the food, the chips and salsa were a-ok. The salsa tasted like a fusion of canned tomatoes and ketchup, which I can assure you is not a good combination. Two stars down. However, the green salsa was good and extra spicy. The chips were super crunchy and highly addictive. \n\nFor starters, we had the chicharrones and I felt it was overpowered with cumin. It was crispy but too salty. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp with garlic and butter sauce) was good but nothing special. It's paired with flour tortillas and that made it fun to eat. \n\nOn to the main courses. We had enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and flautas. What a disappointment. The dishes were bland and tasteless. We had to add salt to every single serving and that is a no, no in my book.  Although the portions are big, it did not make up for the mediorce options on the menu. Three stars down.\n\nAs for service, our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She always made sure we had our refills on drinks, tortillas, and chips and salsa. We didn't try their margaritas but overheard from the two tables next to us that they were \"pretty damn strong.\" Too bad I won't be coming back to give you an updated review on that.\n\nI should of known that it wasn't meant for me to try the food here when we were already denied the first time around.

I'm no help.\n\nWhat I can say, is that while they're not re-defining the bounds of Mexican food, you can find a classic Mexican restaurant menu here. You know the kind: enchiladas, burritos, tacos, chiles rellenos; the old reliables. You get a bunch of chips and salsa to your table, and one of them was a bit too hot for me, but it will burn your mouth in the best way. They don't want to be precious or fancy, they just want to be an old school neighborhood spot.\n\nThat's what they are: a neighborhood spot. On a Saturday evening in the neighborhood I noticed a lot of families coming in. Granted, it was early for dinner. Like, embarrassingly early. But they definitely had a full house by 6pm, and it wasn't rowdy, rather neighbors filing in. \n\nIt's simple, they have a really great neon sign out front, and some old school booths as well as a dining area on the non-bar side of the building. the bar is a cool little wrap area, and they were stuffed to the gills with margarita glasses and limes. Even though I'm not a drinker, I can tell they do a serious business of margaritas. They have all the usual suspects on the menu, all the normal Mexican beers, and from the looks of the marg glasses, you can order a bunch and enjoy the night just fine.\n\nI had a chimichanga and it was exactly as you'd expect. But it was well-made, simple, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. \n\nThe comparison to Tommy's is inevitable, so I'll throw in my non-alcoholic two cents: I'd much rather eat here than there. The alco-philes can argue the maragaritas and tequilas all day without my input, but food wise it really was no contest.

That's why the five stars.  \n\nIt seemed like all the Mexican places I found on Yelp were either burrito joints or sit-down restaurants with high-dollar interior Mex food.  I wanted a Mexican restaurant like the ones I grew up eating as a SoCal suburb girl.  Americanized Mexican combinations that are REALLY good.  Nothing fancy; just solid (traditional chile relleno beats out one with goat cheese and pine-nuts in my book).  A sit-down restaurant that served chips and salsa right off the bat.  Has great homemade guacamole.  And an enchilada with good enchilada sauce (not mole sauce or super-mild red sauce).  This place was perfect.  \n\nWell, the rice IS kinda a mystery.  The flavor is like Chicken Rice-a-roni but milder.  But the beans are deliciously topped with that sizzling white cheese.  And I recommend asking them for HOT sauce.  If you mix it with the salsa they give you, it's TOPS.  \n\nI had a chicken taco, cheese enchilada and shredded beef and bean burrito (for a combo plate, the burrito is was HUGE).  I had some of my boyfriend's chile relleno.  Everything was awesome.  The flan was perfect too.\n\nGo here for the best mexican family restaurant I've seen yet in these parts.

The Spanish rice was made with Risotto style rice, the salad came covered in Salsa, and the refried beans, basically tasted like a 50 cent can of refried beans.\n\nThe chips and so-called salsa did little for me.

I know, she probably needs to work, etc. etc. etc. Fine. I'm not against old people working... just find another job, not waitressing at a busy restaurant.\n\nAnyway, needless to say, she was really slow, we had to repeat our orders at least five times, and she continuously forgot to get us drinks. We got our chips right away from the bus boy, but never received any water. The bus boy was friendly and fast. We ended up just asking him for a lot of things. Perhaps the waitress thought it was beneath her to bring us water. It is, after all, a bus boy's job.\n\nOnto the food... it was average. This is as whitewashed of a Mexican restaurant as it gets. The only thing I remember was my flauta, which was very crispy, the way they should be. The salsa was good, and the chips seemed fresh.\n\nI guess if you like the Americanized sour cream drenched, cheese covered enchilada two/three item combos, then this is the place to go.

I had purchased some half off dinner vouchers for Tia Margarita online months ago and completely forgot about them.  Since the vouchers expired yesterday, I went with a friend to try the place out. Each voucher was good for 2 small (not small by any means) combo dishes and 2 margaritas.  We could only use one of the vouchers last night.  The Manager, Jennifer, kindly extended the second voucher it so that I could either come back or give it to someone else to enjoy.  \n\nThis place was great!  A pleasant find; I will recommend and return to with family and friends. We were greeted right away and provided a table.  Chips and 2 types of salsa were brought to our table. Showed our friendly server our vouchers and he told us what was included.  Made us feel very welcomed.  Portion sizes are very generous...plenty for lunch left over's.  The small combo dish came with two main dish choices, black beans, rice and green salad.  The rice and beans were full of flavor as was the entire dish (Shredded Beef Burrito and a Chile Relleno).  The Margaritas are as original as you can get.  Our meals came with a Double Top Shelf Margaritas; a few sips of that and you are on cloud 9!  :)  A little too strong at first but as the ice melted, it was fine and fully enjoyed!  \n\nThe horseshoe shaped bar is very inviting.

Half-way through eating their 'chicken dish' my guest noticed that there were chunks of beef in the 'chicken' dish. We immediately asked to speak to a manager and when my guest stated that they were highly offended by the beef in their dish due to religious practices, the manager rudely said 'that's chicken, there's no beef.' I had to pull out the chunks of beef and put them on the side of the plate to show her that there was in fact beef in the dish. And even still, she questioned the fact that it was beef. SO RUDE. The manager's questioning of our rightful accusation was rude and not customer service-oriented at all. Instead of addressing the offensive nature of what had just occurred, she repeatedly insisted we order something else. Why would we want to order anything else when you've lost all the trust of your customer by not taking their concern seriously?

Did I mention the margis rule???\n\n\nFull Review:\n-------------------\nI have eaten here a few times and was disappointed with the Mexican food the first few times, having grown up in San Diego and been weaned on the best. After 12 years in SF I know there is much better Mexican restaurants around (La Barca and Tortilla Heights are two great ones) and even many better taquerias (La Taqueria and Nick's are epic). But the basic staples I have discovered to be very good. What has always kept me coming back (probably 15 times now) is the ultra friendly bartender (manager?) Francisco and his truly authentic margaritas. \n\nThe margaritas here are made using only good quality silver tequila, cointreau triple sec and fresh lime juice (so no sugary mix). I rarely drink margaritas because those made with the sweet and sour mix give me brutal heart burn but I have no problem taking down a few authentic margaritas and quite enjoy those served here. Just one of the jumbo margis will smack you in the face and two will make you delightfully toasted and much smarter, funnier and better looking. \n\nThe other cool thing about the place is that most of the patrons (like myself) are locals from the Richmond/Seacliff neighborhoods so on a Friday night you see lots of familiar faces. \n\nThe only other bummer is the place has limited hours (they close at 10:30 Friday and they do not open on weekends until 4PM!). WTF? Anyways, if you go for the margis and basic Mexican staples. Also, definitely sit at the bar as Francisco (the more outgoing, mexi-beach bum bartender) is much friendlier and efficient than the wait staff I have experienced.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-15"}, {"excerpts": [", I had the chicken enchiladas with a fried egg on top.

This was in spite of the fact that our table was right next to a little window to the bar where all the waiters picked up the drinks.

After 12 years in SF I know there is much better Mexican restaurants around (La Barca and Tortilla Heights are two great ones) and even many better taquerias (La Taqueria and Nick's are epic). But the basic staples I have discovered to be very good. What has always kept me coming back (probably 15 times now) is the ultra friendly bartender (manager?) Francisco and his truly authentic margaritas. \n\nThe margaritas here are made using only good quality silver tequila, cointreau triple sec and fresh lime juice (so no sugary mix). I rarely drink margaritas because those made with the sweet and sour mix give me brutal heart burn but I have no problem taking down a few authentic margaritas and quite enjoy those served here. Just one of the jumbo margis will smack you in the face and two will make you delightfully toasted and much smarter, funnier and better looking. \n\nThe other cool thing about the place is that most of the patrons (like myself) are locals from the Richmond/Seacliff neighborhoods so on a Friday night you see lots of familiar faces. \n\nThe only other bummer is the place has limited hours (they close at 10:30 Friday and they do not open on weekends until 4PM!). WTF? Anyways, if you go for the margis and basic Mexican staples. Also, definitely sit at the bar as Francisco (the more outgoing, mexi-beach bum bartender) is much friendlier and efficient than the wait staff I have experienced.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-15"}, {"excerpts": ["My buddy ordered a small combination plate and that came with TWO burritos!

The waiters forgot our orders,  bartenders ignored us, and it was not quite the same experience. The margaritas were actually pretty bad? So we ordered some top shelf to see if there would be a difference -- nope. The food quality was different, too! Our sampler's empanada's looked like fried cheese bread.
