What makes HS stand out is their creativity. Their creative flavors are bold and intense. You won't find normal vanilla, chocolate or strawberry here. On my most recent visit to SF I went to HS three times. I tried many of their flavors, all of which were really good. I think their ice creams are a bit denser than most I have tried but they're still pretty creamy.

You could taste the bourbon so much that I swore I was going to be drunk by the time I was finished with my scoop. It also had a somewhat caramel taste. I also loved the crispy corn flakes inside this ice cream too. My other favorites were the black sesame, PB curry and Jesus Juice, which also had a strong alcohol taste. HS also has some excellent toppings, like homemade mallow fluff, frosted peanuts, alcohol infused cherries, homemade butterscotch, etc. \n\nThe three times I visited the lines were actually really short, which was surprising. The prices here are slightly high but the quality and intense flavors of their ice cream make up for the prices. The staff here are all super friendly and willing to let you try as many free samples as you'd like.

It has a distinct bourbon flavor which slightly lingers in your mouth. It's creamy, smooth, and not too sweet. The cornflakes add a nice crunch. I'm a clear type of gal, so I didn't care much for the SB.\n\n*Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee: DELIOUSNESS! I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but when I do have it, I enjoy having Viet Coffee from the local hole-in-the-wall pho place. If you like Viet coffee, you will love the BBVC. The BBVC was creamy, sweet, and a tad bit tart from the coffee grinds. You can really taste the kick from the coffee, especially when you get a piece of the coffee grinds, but the condensed milk flavor balances it our perfectly. It's sweet w/o being overly sweet.\n\n*Pink Apple: At first, the description of apples and cranberry didn't seem appealing at all. But, having a bit of my friend's, I felt like kicking myself for not sampling the PA beforehand. It has a very clean and crisp apple flavor and tasted like you were eating a creamy frozen apple. I didn't really taste the cranberries, and I think it gave the sorbet the red color more than anything. If you're looking for a refreshing treat, go for the PA!\n\n*Tahitian Vanilla: Mmmmm...although I was expecting more of a vanilla flavor too it, I wasn't disappointed.
