JB and I settled ourselves into the leather section sofa underneath the front window. Immediately, water is brought to our table and wine lists placed in front of us. We were in a serious talking mood so instead of asking for flights or tastings, we both reached into our respective minds and asked for wines from specific regions. \n\nChris, the owner, had a Petite Syrah from Dry Creek Valley (my new favorite wine region in Sonoma). He knows his wines well. My friend JB managed a 60 seat fine dining establishment in her previous life and was talking Italian wines with Chris. \n\nThe bathroom was spotless. I wondered aloud if it would be just as clean on a Friday night and Chris said, \"Yes, I make sure of it.\"\n\nChris was friendly but knew when to walk away and leave us to our discussion. Music was alternately soft and loud, which was a bit strange. However, he even played Patsy Cline...gotta love that.

I was very pleased with the small plates that we shared and the wine paired nicely. \n\nWe shared one of the preset menus of appetizers (I don't recall all of them but a few were quite good that they stood out in my mind.) The salted Brussels sprouts were delicious, and the aioli sauce that came with the dish added a creamy finish that was just perfect. One of my coworkers loved the artichoke dip so much that we ordered another plate. The variety of pizza plates appealed to all of us. My personal favorite was the pesto flatbread. The smoked trout and lightly toasted bread was also a group pleaser. \n\nOverall, I'll definitely be back!

YOLO! Ok, ok... more like ratchet. \n\nNow that I'm in my 30s, all I care about is wrinkle cream, flats, spanx, and sleep. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still like going out at night and getting a happy buzz but I don't want to deal with parking, long lines, crowds, and running into my friend's younger sibling(s).\n\nMe: \"Oh hey, what are you doing here?\"\nFriend's younger sibling: \"It's my homegirl's 21st birthday. What are YOU doing here?\"\n\nMe: \"........\"\n\nUmm yah, so wine bars are now my BFF. \n\nYield Wine Bar is perfect for someone like me; someone that still wants to enjoy the night life without getting all ratchet. Street parking is plentiful. Getting a seat isn't a problem before 10 pm (there's two communal tables for larger groups). And, the chances of getting sh*tfaced is minimal since they don't serve hard liquor. It's also a great date place as it's more intimate and the music isn't blaring so you can actually hold a conversation. \n\nYield serves sustainable, organic and biodynamic (eco-friendly) wine. For wines by the glass, there were about 5 selections each for sparkling, white, and red wine ranging from $9-$13. Bottles ranged from mid $30s to low $80s. Happy hour is Monday - Friday, 4:30 pm - 7 pm and half bottle carafes are $12. \n\nThey also have a rotating bar bite menu with vegan options (Hi John & Chel!). On the night that we went, there were nuts, olives, cheese, dips, and flatbreads on the menu ($6-$13). Kitchen closes at 10 pm. \n\nI had a glass of the sparkling rose and a chardonnay that I wasn't too crazy about but that's just me as I prefer Italian or French wines. The food and service more than made up for it though. \n \nMy gf and I shared the grilled brussel sprouts ($6), cod sliders (2 for $8), and the Parisian flatbread ($13) for a late dinner. The cod sliders are a must order. A pan-fried cod patty topped with a creamy sriracha aioli, buttery avocados, and sandwiched between a pillowy Hawaiian bun. I love sweet and salty combos so the Parisian flatbread was an easy choice as it was topped with brie, apples, and caramelized onions: http://bit.ly/1mYxUOp. The flatbread had a nice crunch with great flavors from the m\u00e9nage a trois of ingredients but the apples could have been sliced thinner as it had more of a mushy texture.\n\nWe spent over 3 hours at Yield and we never felt rushed. Our waitress was an absolute sweetheart and kept checking in with us to make sure everything was ok. \n\nDefinitely adding Yield to my weekend rotation as they close at midnight which gives me enough time to go home to catch an episode of Cheaters.
