But this last time we were there, was terrible! Our food that we got was good, we order the Cookie Bottom thingy, I didn't want two scoops of just vanilla ice cream so we instead got one scoop of Cookies n Cream and one of Rocky Road. They gave us more Rocky Road ice cream than Cookies n Cream. Plus wayyy more whipped cream too.\n\nHere's the thing though...we waited for just that one item for about 25 mins!!! We came with friends and they ordered right before us, we'll they got theirs first of course so I thought within the next five mins I should get mine...NOPE! They were done with theirs and we still didn't get ours...I had the BF go check to see what was up and the workers told him its coming up. We waited...I saw people who came in after us get theirs...so we still waited, after waiting for about five mins more, I had it. The BF goes up to see what's taking so long, they told him again \"It's coming up.\" He told them how long we've been waiting and I guess they HAD to make it right then in there cuz he came back with it. I was mad though! I know the place was super busy, but I've been there before when it's been super busy and I didn't have to wait THAT long for one item! I couldn't believe it. There was a family of like I think 8 who sat @ a table next to us...they ordered 7 items and got it before us, that made me kinda want to just get my money back. \n\nThe workers were kinda rude too. When we were waiting for a table to open up, we of course were standing in the way. Well this one worker, an older lady, had an order and she was looking for the number right. Well I wasn't really in the way, I was standing by the stairs and she comes by doesn't even say excuse me and bumps into me. I say excuse me out loud and she just looks @ me with a dirty look like \"well if you weren't in 'my' way that wouldn't have happened.\" I know having a job sucks, but you don't need to show it. Suck it up!!! People are going there to have a good experience, A LOT of tourists, not to mention. If you don't like how it is there, then quit!! \n\nI would give this place four stars, but thinking about it, I don't think they deserve it. I would give three and a half but since there isn't a half star up there, they only get three stars.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-05-07"}], "raspberry sorbet": [], "marshmallow cream": [], "strawberry topping": [], "ghirardelli mini dark chocolate chips": [], "maraschino cherry": [], "ghirardelli chocolate brownie": [], "classic ghirardelli hot cocoa": [], "caramel latte": [], "hazelnut latte": [], "pumpkin pie latte": [], "caff\u00e8 mocha": []}
