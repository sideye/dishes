I'm not sure how I didn't see it here before, as I visit the truffle shop around the corner every time I'm in town, but today I did see it. I had just checked into my hotel, and taken the bus up to this neighborhood to get truffles as my first SF destination (because priorities) and I decided to take a quick detour for a pastry or cookie or something first. It's the kind of thing that a trip to San Francisco *should* involve. Having delicious destinations, but being open to trying all kinds of new things as they come up. Finding cute bakeries and sharing a few treats while seated at a small table, watching people walk by. Sipping, smiling, sampling.\n\nRoll the dice and sometimes you lose, but not today. I walked in and saw that they have cookies for sale by the pound, and I ordered one of every single cookie on the middle shelf. They happily obliged and I ended up with a menagerie of delightful little cookies. They were all very European--small, cute, and would have been perfect to sample, share, and compare notes. But I was flying solo today and ate them all myself. I sat down at the cute table out front and ate every last one all by myself. I closed my eyes and felt the sun on my face, the breeze in the air, and the flavors in my mouth. It was aaaaalmost perfect.\n\nOf the cookies, the lunette is the most interesting, with its heart shape and window between layers that lets you peek into the jam. They're gorgeous. But the real winner was the almond flavored one, with the pine nut topping and the amazing chew. I can't even describe the perfect balance of sweet and texture and crunch. I could eat a dozen right now. \n\nThis really is the kind of place you just pop in and try. Their signature princess cake looks tremendous and you can try a slice, or there are a few others that were very tempting. The eclairs (choose from cream or custard) also called my name, but I will come back to share this sort of experience with others in the future; there's much to try.\n\nI left, and then went and got my truffles. And then I wandered and tried three other places on a whim. But there's so much more to explore, so I'll be back to the neighborhood, and back to Victoria.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-06-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The most popular items in here are their PRINCESS CAKE & CANNOLIS.

I frequent Chinatown every weekend for my weekly veggie and fruit shopping and Vietnamese food or dim sum fix, yet I never thought of walking in here to try their pastries....until I suddenly had a craving for cannollis. I don't know why, but I haven't had a cannoli since I've accepted my lactose-intolerance status years ago. I think the last time I had one was...10 years ago (?) from Dianda's Bakery here in the Mission. And here I was, craving for a connolli and I think it's because Lent is upon us and I usually give-up certain foods during Lent, including dessert, but cannolis??  Anyhoo, instead of stopping by Dianda's  on the way home (I live nearby), I thought I'd try this place since I was already in the area getting my pho fix. \n\nAs I walked-in, there was a lot of chatter from the patrons who were in there having coffee and pastries as an afternoon snack. No, not Italian, but Cantonese =). Remember, Chinatown is a hop, skip away. So the display was pretty empty. They still had cookies and various whole and slices of cakes, but I didn't see any cannolis. I was the next person to be helped and I told the young woman that I wanted two cannolis. She looked in the display case and of course she didn't say any left, but told me she would go to the back to get some. From what I've read in a previous review, they make their cannollis made to order. I paid for my cannollis ahead of time and about 5 min. later, she came back out with small box of cannolis =). I was happy. I now had my cannollis to satisfy my craving and dessert fix before Lent. \n\nSince I had two, I decided to only eat one with my tea when I got home and save the other for the next day. I was happy with my choice. Filling was firm and not runny, not too sweet, and had mini chocolate chips with a marachino cherry on each end. Mmmm....good choice, although I was eyeing there slice of tiramisu in t heir display case. Hmmm.....I just might have to go back on Monday or Tuesday before Lent to try that =D. \n\nOh, the cannolis set me back $8.50 ($4.25 for each). A little pricey??

I know it's been discussed before, but their Princess Cake is divine.   Pastry cream, whipped cream, and marzipan with one layer of raspberry jam is perfection.   Their tiramisu is a little heavy on the alcohol, but still good.  The other pastries I've tried have been good, but don't knock your socks off like the Princess Cake.   So on our last day driving out to Redwood City to our son's house, we were going to pick up Princess Cake but Richmond bakery called Schubert's was way more convenient.  VPC is a slightly better cake but about 60% more expensive than Schubert's on Clement St., so take that into account if you don't want the hassle of North Beach and want to pay $20 for a cake rather than $34.   Wish I got to the Bay area more often (only there about once/year to visit my son & his gf) as I adore VPC.   The owner & the staff are sweeties.  A few tables out front in the shade, as well as a few tables inside where my long-suffering husband sits & waits (he rarely eats desserts).

"], "author": "The Man M.", "review": "Youra gooda boy....\n\nOk --- I am 37 and yet I didn't mind being called a good boy by the woman who concocted my tasty treats. You should know a couple things about me. I try really hard to eat well six days a week. The seventh is pure gluttony! And I plan for it. I strategize as to how I am going to indulge. Today it was Victoria Pastry Co. I made the family wait in the car as I ran in to order (mainly because I knew my wife's mouth would drop as I picked one item after another). \"I'm gonna need a box\" I said when she asked me what I would like.  I ordered 2 cannolis for myself, a piece of chocolate cake for my wife's belated birthday, a napoleon for me, a kitty cat cookie for my daughter, and a chocolate eclair for me. (I do think of others....) \n\nI consider my self a critique of the eclair; so questioned the contents, \"is there real custard in there or something else\" --- \"I hava both custard and cream\" = \"Custard\" I replied without hesitation. \"And the napoleons too?\" --- \"Custard also\" she retorted.\n\"one of those please\"\n\n\"Youra gooda boy\" she said and handed me a complementary piece of cinnamon sour cream cake ( not bad also). I could not wait to get home.\n\nNow the review: the cannoli is as traditional as I have had in a while, not overstuffed with over-sweetened cream. The cookie was sturdy, and had more flavor than many of the other wafer types you find. The cream, though a bit bland for my taste, was very good. All in all, a solid A- for the treat. The napoleon: B+, though I am not a frequenter of the pastry. The pastry layers were a bit stiff, making the process a bit difficult to navigate. The custard was phenomenal! The cookie was good (and cute) and the chocolate espresso cake was very rich and moist; a clear A-. Now the best for last.\n\nThe best for last. Having tasted the custard with the napoleon, I could hardly wait to eat the eclair. But when I did, it surpassed my expectations. This is old school and what I mean by that, this is classic pat a choux, real custard and a fabulous chocolate ganache. This is like grandma used to make. The custard has been in the pat a choux just long enough for the texture to be firm on the outside and doughy on the inside. The ganache has a soft texture and melts on the roof of your mouth like a buttery kiss. A curve wrecker on the grading scale -  A+++.\n\nI will be back --- next Saturday of course. As for the rest of today --- harris' steak dinner and crme brule for yet another desert. Then, back to the gym for six more days.\n\nAdded commentary:  Victoria vs. Beard Papa  - this is kinda like Mercedes versus Porsche --- the two are very distinctive and good. Victoria is old school and classic (Mercedes) where as Papa is more performance (Porsche). \"It has an addictive chemical in it that makes ya crave it fortnightly smart ass\" (bonus points to those you can source the quote, which shouldn't be too hard in this city). There is no clear winner between the two.

I'm not sure how I didn't see it here before, as I visit the truffle shop around the corner every time I'm in town, but today I did see it. I had just checked into my hotel, and taken the bus up to this neighborhood to get truffles as my first SF destination (because priorities) and I decided to take a quick detour for a pastry or cookie or something first. It's the kind of thing that a trip to San Francisco *should* involve. Having delicious destinations, but being open to trying all kinds of new things as they come up. Finding cute bakeries and sharing a few treats while seated at a small table, watching people walk by. Sipping, smiling, sampling.\n\nRoll the dice and sometimes you lose, but not today. I walked in and saw that they have cookies for sale by the pound, and I ordered one of every single cookie on the middle shelf. They happily obliged and I ended up with a menagerie of delightful little cookies. They were all very European--small, cute, and would have been perfect to sample, share, and compare notes. But I was flying solo today and ate them all myself. I sat down at the cute table out front and ate every last one all by myself. I closed my eyes and felt the sun on my face, the breeze in the air, and the flavors in my mouth. It was aaaaalmost perfect.\n\nOf the cookies, the lunette is the most interesting, with its heart shape and window between layers that lets you peek into the jam. They're gorgeous. But the real winner was the almond flavored one, with the pine nut topping and the amazing chew. I can't even describe the perfect balance of sweet and texture and crunch. I could eat a dozen right now. \n\nThis really is the kind of place you just pop in and try. Their signature princess cake looks tremendous and you can try a slice, or there are a few others that were very tempting. The eclairs (choose from cream or custard) also called my name, but I will come back to share this sort of experience with others in the future; there's much to try.\n\nI left, and then went and got my truffles.

You should know a couple things about me. I try really hard to eat well six days a week. The seventh is pure gluttony! And I plan for it. I strategize as to how I am going to indulge. Today it was Victoria Pastry Co. I made the family wait in the car as I ran in to order (mainly because I knew my wife's mouth would drop as I picked one item after another). \"I'm gonna need a box\" I said when she asked me what I would like.  I ordered 2 cannolis for myself, a piece of chocolate cake for my wife's belated birthday, a napoleon for me, a kitty cat cookie for my daughter, and a chocolate eclair for me. (I do think of others....) \n\nI consider my self a critique of the eclair; so questioned the contents, \"is there real custard in there or something else\" --- \"I hava both custard and cream\" = \"Custard\" I replied without hesitation. \"And the napoleons too?\" --- \"Custard also\" she retorted.\n\"one of those please\"\n\n\"Youra gooda boy\" she said and handed me a complementary piece of cinnamon sour cream cake ( not bad also). I could not wait to get home.\n\nNow the review: the cannoli is as traditional as I have had in a while, not overstuffed with over-sweetened cream. The cookie was sturdy, and had more flavor than many of the other wafer types you find. The cream, though a bit bland for my taste, was very good. All in all, a solid A- for the treat. The napoleon: B+, though I am not a frequenter of the pastry. The pastry layers were a bit stiff, making the process a bit difficult to navigate. The custard was phenomenal! The cookie was good (and cute) and the chocolate espresso cake was very rich and moist; a clear A-. Now the best for last.\n\nThe best for last. Having tasted the custard with the napoleon, I could hardly wait to eat the eclair. But when I did, it surpassed my expectations. This is old school and what I mean by that, this is classic pat a choux, real custard and a fabulous chocolate ganache. This is like grandma used to make. The custard has been in the pat a choux just long enough for the texture to be firm on the outside and doughy on the inside. The ganache has a soft texture and melts on the roof of your mouth like a buttery kiss. A curve wrecker on the grading scale -  A+++.\n\nI will be back --- next Saturday of course. As for the rest of today --- harris' steak dinner and crme brule for yet another desert. Then, back to the gym for six more days.\n\nAdded commentary:  Victoria vs. Beard Papa  - this is kinda like Mercedes versus Porsche --- the two are very distinctive and good. Victoria is old school and classic (Mercedes) where as Papa is more performance (Porsche). \"It has an addictive chemical in it that makes ya crave it fortnightly smart ass\" (bonus points to those you can source the quote, which shouldn't be too hard in this city). There is no clear winner between the two. Try them both --- I did --- and will, again, -\nAnd again.\nAnd.....", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-11-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Their napoleons are to die for -- and this coming from someone who doesn't care much for desserts.
