A couple hours of senseless violence that was displayed through the launching of rubber balls at peoples heads and other extremities. I threw like a girl because my repaired right shoulder still doesn't have 100% strength. Which meant I was out a few times and couldn't really hit anyone. I was still able to catch the ball but what fun is that, right?\n\nSo after the games, we decided to walk over to Roxies, a place I know of by name but not by consumption. You walk in and the first thing you notice is how tiny the place is. Typical deli/corner store style place. The walls are fridges for drinks and maybe a freezer. One wall is where the food and deli counter is. Simple and easy and works great. So I order the Roxie special. Had a nice conversation with the guy and then with a lady that worked there that knew the original owners of Little Luccas. Since the place was kinda tight, we ordered and waited outside for them to get done after paying for them.\n\nWhat we weren't expecting was a free show. Almost like something out of Cops! Freaking hilarious shit! This skinny bony dude walks in and orders a sandwich and is leaving the store after paying for it. Then this other guy on a bike, kinda heavy set and looking kinda out of it starts talking shit to the skinny guy. Skinny dude walks backwards across two cross walks while talking smack back at bike guy, navigating their way through on coming traffic. Eventually, the guy with the bike came back and decided to tell us the reason why without much prodding from us. It turns out the skinny dude broke into bike guy's mom's house. Small world...Apparently too small...\n\nSo after the drama ended with a fizzle, our sandwiches slowly got done and we picked them up in order. After we got the food, we turned our attention the park and sat on the grass. The sandwich was amazing! The meats and the surprising melted goodness of American cheese on the sandwich was incredible! It's been a while since I've had American cheese. I never knew it could taste this good melted and on fine Italian deli meats. So we all ate and knocked back a few more brews before heading our own separate ways. \n\nNow that I know that they make good sandwiches, I will be back to the other selections they have on their menu.

Unless the other patrons physically have sandwiches in their hands and the cashier is actively helping them, there is no one in line.  You can waste a lot of time in there 'waiting in line' when all you've been doing is standing around with all the suckas who didn't call in their order.\n\nI always get the hot pastrami on soft Spanish roll (I know everyone sings the praises of the dutch crunch, but unlike you folks I like the roof of my mouth uninjured, so I go with the soft Spanish roll, kind of like a Cuban roll; soft on the inside and crunchy crusty on the outside).

The Junior size is a hefty sandwich that I wouldn't associate with the word little. The bread was...OMGSOGOOD (I'm a sucker for good bread and today, I was suckered) And MUSHROOMS and KIDNEY BEANS?! I was very happily surprised when I came to the realization that this was not a \"vegetarian\" sandwich, this was a VEGETARIAN SANDWICH. Most sandwich shops like to throw in an extra heaping of \"the works\", slip in a few slices of avocado and call it a day.\n\nI am always one to ask questions and since I didn't know what \"Mortadella\" was, I asked. The guy working behind the counter willingly answered, \"It's like bologna, want to try some?\" and offered me a slice.

It's so good, I even drove out of my way (moved to daly city) to get it after I came home already from sfsu. The prices are about 7-8$ for a jr which isn't too small, 10 for a regular, and about 15 for supreme. I normally get a regular and it fills me up with the wholesome goodness.  Their dutch crunch bread is amazing. I even met Simon after going there soo many times and the normal cashier there pretty much knows me.
