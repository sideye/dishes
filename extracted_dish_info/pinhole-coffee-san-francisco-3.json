I love the painting of a man in a coffee mug car riding down bernal heights with a pinhole camera attached to his face!

The piccolo is like a combination of a latte and a cortado because of the small size and steamed milk.\n\nAnd you know what makes this place even better??  They serve pastries from Third Culture Bakery!!  The Matcha Green Tea Custard Cake was sooo incredibly good!!  Very soft and delicious, perfectly paired with a drink!\n\nUnfortunately, wifi isn't provided here and I didn't really see outlets either.  Luckily I was using my sister's laptop that is connected to xfinity WiFi so I was able to get some work done still.  Wooden benches can tire your booty out after a while though, but there are a few pillows laying around.  This place seems to promote having conversations and catching up with people or on a good book rather than working on laptops.  The plus side is that having no wifi should (hopefully) keep me from getting too distracted from my textbook readings.\n\nQuality coffee and good vibes here.
