We arrived around early dinner hour and it was already packed.  Granted the place is not super huge, but it was still packed!  We waited at the door to be seated and was eventually \"greeted\" by the host who was very busy, hands full, serving multiple tables.  He wasn't particularly friendly, but not completely cold.  There were two small tables open and we were told we could sit wherever we'd like.  We chose a booth seat next to another couple, towards the front of the restaurant so that we could get close to the natural light.  \n\nShortly after seating ourselves, another server quickly stocked us with a basket of chips and two house salsas.  One was a mild pico de gallo and the other was a hotter red sauce.  Being of sensitive mouth when it comes to all things spicy, I preferred the flavor and heat of the pico de gallo, but both salsas were flavorful.  It was a tad bit of a wait before our waitress had a free moment to address us for drinks (because it was so busy) and in the meantime, they re-stocked our chips for us without us having to ask!  \n\nThe waitress was really nice, once she finally arrived, and I opted to try their peach margarita and bistek.

I don't mind if the food isn't top shelf....but in a way it is, because house favs like the quesadilla platter with a side of great guac followed a few drinks later by grilled chicken suizas perfectly suit me....i want to stress that the pitchers at PA are still, as far as I know, too difficult to make with fresh squeezed lime.....yes, i know odwalla etc might make big old half gallons of fresh lime juice, but the $$arm and a leg$$$ for that kind of juice is daunting to an individual in this economy, let alone a business, i would imagine. Everyone at Puerto is your friend, if you visit enough. My dear gf met her fiance there, hooked up by yours truly via a happy margarita-fueled invite to join our table that I passed along to him as he sat at the bar last winter....they are gonna get hitched in hawaii this xmas! warm fuzzies to the family:  Lorenzo, Patty and ALL the gang at PA!", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-11-19"}, {"excerpts": ["the easiest way to forget about the wait to get into Puerto Alegre, which is typically absurd, is to order youself a pitcher of lime margaritas.

They were both fresh and had a decent amount of heat.\n\nThe first time I went, our waitress was very friendly and helpful, great customer service.  The most recent time, not so much.  The first guy seemed okay, but he I guess ended up leaving before I was done with my meal.  Another guy and girl took over, and when I got my bill, I saw that my tequila sampler was $18.  $2 difference from what I was told, no big deal, but I figured I'd mention it.
