They have a vegetarian menu for which you'll need to ask, but the servers happily provides that and anything else you'd like.  More bread?  Certainly!  More bread to go with your leftovers?  That's fine, too.  The service isn't always very prompt but since you're probably going to be the only one in there, you can't necessarily expect them to be perpetually on their toes.

Came here after reading the SFGate's article on Yemeni food and I just had to try. \n\nParking wasn't too bad since it's in a quieter part of the tender-nob. Inside, pictures of Yemen/Middle East decorate the walls while music videos from the Middle East show on their tv. Went for lunch and it wasn't really busy but I knew this place had authentic food from the steady stream of Middle Eastern men, most of them dining solo. \n\nStarted with the maraq ($1) - lamb broth soup which reminded me of miso soup since it was clean without any fatty residue. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_M1DqDEZx2k24g1onEAQUQ&userid=pDfL8xt8F8ls0-kQIG_ADg)\n\nFalafal ($5) - 4 pieces and these were more pancake like in shape with a denser texture than a typical Mediterranean falafal. \n\nSaltah $10 - Our waitress suggested this Yemeni traditional dish which is like a braised lamb soup. It came to the table bubbling and the flavors of the tender lamb reminded me of Indian cuisine but softer, not as bold and complex. A comfort food type of dish. \n\nChicken gyro plate ($11) - came with a bunch of fresh veggies and the chicken was more chicken strips than the gyro that comes on a spit. Just ok. \n\nFinished the meal off with some Yemeni red and milk tea which had a hint of sweetness. ($1.50 each) \n\nIf you want an authentic taste of Yemen here's your place. Bring your quarters for the meters, not your passport.\n\nI'd come back to try this grilled lamb dish that everyone else was ordering.

But when we received our order, we noticed that the description on Seamless for the saut\u00e9ed vegetable dish was very different compared to what we actually got.  On the menu, it was supposed to include zucchini, potato, eggplant, green pepper and onion with homemade red sauce, for $10.  What we did get was a tiny portion of saut\u00e9ed green pepper and onion (maybe 3 tablespoonful), sans sauce, over rice, which was not mentioned on the menu.  So this turned out to be a very expensive side dish disguised as an entr\u00e9e with the addition of the rice.\n\nThe chicken dish was topped with cream sauce which was not mentioned on the menu.\n  \nThe lamb stew was quite bitter, something that I am not sure should be the case.  I also later read online that this type of dish should be accompanied by some type of bread, which makes sense considering that it's more liquid than anything else.\n\nThe lamb liver turned out to be the winning dish for both of us.  Though it was also presented differently to us than described on the menu, julienned instead of cubed liver, the meat was very tender, flavorful and not at all gamey as we feared.\n\nSo, all in all, everything was edible, but nothing really wowed us.

We went for lunch. We walked in and were warmly greeted.  The waitress told us to sit where we'd like.  She brought us this amazing tasting tea in these little clear glass cups. For an Aghan it is important to be served tea in a clear cup or it just isn't right.  The owner came and greeted us too.  He spoke to my husband as if they had known each other...it was nice.  We had the combination kabob...it melted in your mouth...yum!  We complemented the tea and the owner brought us a whole tea kettle.  After our meal the owner brought us some baklava and cookies...on the house...which was very nice. All in All 5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service, 5 stars for the hospitality.  The owner treated us as if we were guests in his home and that is just good old Mulsim hospitality...Thanks.  Definately recommend this place.
