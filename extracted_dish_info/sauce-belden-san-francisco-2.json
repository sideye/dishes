And it's a lot of food!  The real highlights of the sampler are the Portabello Mushroom Fries and the Bowl of Bacon.  The PM Fries come with a Ranch Dipping sauce and is so good!  I think even if you're not a mushroom fan, you'll probably want to dive into these suckers!! \nHere's another look at the Portabello Mushroom Fries when ordered separately --  (http://bit.ly/Pz7maK).  And the Bowl of Bacon is just simply magical.  Their Bacon is really sweet and smokey.  It's almost like candy!\n\nIf there's one constant that featured through their menu, it's definitely their Bacon.  They serve it in a bowl, on their Deviled Eggs, with their Salmon, and wrapped around mini meatloaf nuggets.\n\nHere are more of their Social Plates that are pretty amazing:\n\nBacon Wrapped Mini Meatloaf --  http://bit.ly/Pz7irn\nWhipped Potato & Pan Gravy\n\nProsciutto Wrapped Figs -- http://bit.ly/SoHY4o\nPoint Reyes Blue Cheese, Balsamic Reduction, Arugula\n\nSeasoned Fry Poutine --  http://bit.ly/SoHYBA\nMozzarella Cheese Curds, Pan Gravy\n\nThey do have main entrees ranging from Fried Chicken, a Deviled Egg Filled Bacon Cheeseburger, and Lobster Rolls to highlight a few.

Don't overlook this item, it's really underrated!!\n\nI do like how they are open pretty late on the weekend so that if you can stop over for a late bite after having a few drinks around town.  And they seem to have some great Happy Hour specials.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a spot that's easily accessible for dinner and for a very unique dining experience in the FiDi, I highly recommend Sauce on Belden.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-03-31"}, {"excerpts": ["I wanted all of the social plates: mini chicken pot pies, sausage cheese bread, bacon wrapped mini meatloaf...

I have been in a lull at work (bored), which actually makes me crazier than being insanely busy (not bored), so I decided to do all of those things I've been meaning to do but haven't. ... Restless person syndrome, and all. \n\nSauce is located in Belden Place, one of my favorite alleys for lunch in the Financial District. Be careful that you don't confuse it with Belden Taverna right next door--they have an extremely convincing hostess (but that place is fly too, so no worries if you have a brain cramp). \n\nI booked a reservation on open table with no hassle. Briefly, did you know you can't reserve a table for greater than five people on Open Table? Weird, because having a large party is probably a major reason to reserve a table in the first place. \n\nAnyhow, I was sat immediately for a 1:00 p.m. reservation on a Friday (hurrah). My friend joined, and we ordered drinks--he ordered an iced tea (bored), whereas I ordered a dark and stormy (not bored).  It was a solid cocktail-not too dark and not too stormy.  You can't really go wrong with black rum, unless you don't drink enough. \n\nSauce's menu is quite appealing. I wanted all of the social plates: mini chicken pot pies, sausage cheese bread, bacon wrapped mini meatloaf... All of that sounds smashing to me. Social plates at lunch, however, are hard to justify, so we skipped right to entrees. I ordered the salmon (bored?) and my friend ordered the burger (not bored). \n\nI note that almost everyone gets the burger, and it is a lovely thing to behold. It's a double, served with bacon, American cheese, chipotle aioli and ketchup. Yum--as an aspiring burger savant, I admit I was tempted to order it. But as a girl who has been clocking mad hours at the gym due to December's peppermint bark fiasco, I could not. I would not. \n\nBut as boring as I thought my order was, I was dead wrong.  It may have been the best salmon dish I've ever had. Sauce's menu describes it as \"sustainably farmed, spinach, bacon, tomato, horseradish and lemon.\" It is all of those things AND a new handbag!  Those flavors were complementary and so delicious together. The bacon--oh, the bacon. And the horseradish was just enough to give the dish a kick of excitement. The salmon was tailored to my taste--not so underdone that it's practically swimming off of the table, yet not so overdone that it's dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service is great.

The flavors were fantastic: at first you get the beautiful cherry and wine flavors of the sauce then a slight smokiness from the meat, then a tinny bite on the backend of the flavor profile of chili pepper.

We were initially concerned that it might be too dry, but when we asked the waitress about it she assured us that it would come out juicy and tender. Thankfully her suggestion was spot on. The dish, came out in about 4 bites, good for a tasting and the bacon complimented the meatloaf well as I think all bacon should.\n\nFinally we ordered the Mac and Cheese, Not exactly the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst. They added what seemed to be bits of pork in the Mac and Cheese, which helped add flavor. If I had the option I would have ordered another of the Portobello fries instead of this. The cheese was fairly mild and the pasta was on the soft side (maybe it was just my dish specifically) and the dish wasn't as tasty as somewhere like Homeroom in Oakland.\n\nWe also ordered 2 drinks (a cocktail and a cider) I didn't get to try the cocktail, but my cider (Crispen Hard Cider) was a bit too mild and seemed to be somewhat on the flatter side to me. Maybe next time I should just stick with the IPAs. Our total came out to be around 60 dollars for the meal. This is probably one of the better late night establishments I've been to in the city.

The deviled eggs were creamy, light and delicious. The mushroom fries and mini pot pies were just ok. But the star of the show was the bowl of bacon. Man! Seasoned with black pepper and brown sugar, these things were a blast! They weren't crispy but instead slow cooked to a very tender texture. Excellent to much on and heavenly to eat. If I would have known, I would have just ordered a few of these as our starter. \n\nFRIED ORGANIC ROSIE's CHICKEN ~ 4 stars: The chicken was crispy and prepped beautifully. I didn't have to work too hard to get a big bite of meat each time. The whipped yukon potatoes were excellent. The gravy brought everything together while the sauteed kale added a bit of greens. An excellent dish. The only thing it was missing, in my opinion, was a little acidity. I probably should have requested a lemon wedge but it really wasn't a deal breaker. Great dish and I would order it again. \n\nBRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS STROGANOFF ~ 4 stars: Tender bites of short ribs sitting on top of parpadelle. Sounds amazing. But they takes it up another notch with their awesome cream sauce, buttered mushrooms and asparagus. This was a complete meal made for a king. The short ribs were tender, moist and completely to die for. The parpadelle was cooked perfectly and went beautifully with the cream sauce. Everything worked on this plate. I also like that it's a HUGE portion. My gf got this and luckily for me, she couldn't finish it. So I went to town on her leftovers. \n\nThe other couple ordered the PEPPERED HANGER STEAK and the short ribs stroganoff. I didn't try the hanger steak but judging by how quickly they cleaned the plate, it was probably pretty damn good. \n\nSauce also offers a pretty healthy list of premium cocktails. I tried their Moscow Mule and it was poured perfectly - tart and refreshing. I then followed that with 2 gin & tonics. Those were also poured beautifully. \n\nAll in all, Sauce was a hit.

I'll admit, I liked it more this way. It allowed for the cheese to stay hot and melted over the sauce instead of hardening and cooling over the chicken.
