Earlier that day on Saturday, I went to pick up a cake from a local bakery to surprise my friend with. The problem was, he was staying with me so there was no way I could bring that cake home. I decided to call the restaurant and ask if they would hold it for me in their refrigerator. Unexpectedly, they answered their phones while they were closed and agreed to hold it! When it was time for the surprise, not only did they bring out the cake, they also accompanied it with a scoop of ice cream and candle. I was sooooo appreciative of that :) Overall, the staff was very consistent in service to that story. On point, everyone was so sweet and so efficient/accommodating to our party. \n\nThe joint is cozy and offers two dining areas next door to each other. The two rooms don't seem to be cohesive, however you can tell they acquired two different spaces and combined it to offer more room for diners. As busy as they were, they did a good job in turning the tables for future guests. \n\nFor dinner here's what I had: \n-Chicken Satay for $9: Chicken skewers marinated in herbs and spices, served with peanut sauce and cucumber salad. The dish came with about 5 skewers and filled with chicken I love the quintessential peanut sauce for any Thai dish, let alone this one. \n\n-Paradise wings for $9: Sweet and savory fried chicken wings saut\u00e9ed with a touch of garlic and topped with fried basil. This was a complete winner for me! Super flavorful and crispy, like the menu says, it's \"The saint to our murder wings' sinner.\" TOTALLY true!\n\n-BBQ Pork for $12: Thin slices of lightly grilled pork marinated in a blend of thai herbs and spices. Served with side salad and a savory sauce. OMG, this was my favorite dish hands down! So much pork in this dish! It was never ending. I tried to order brown rice for $2 on the side to be healthy and it was a little gummy; should've ordered the white rice but the dish more than made up for that! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\n-Oxtail Soup for $15: Oxtail slow stewed with carrot, tomato, and cabbage. This dish is rich and hearty, with a great balance between sweet and salty. Ok so I got this the last time I was here but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to talk about it. I LOVE the amount of oxtail that's in this dish the broth is rich and flavorful. Order a side of rice for $2 and you've got the PERFECT soup on a rainy day (or any day for that matter).\n\nI'm so happy this place is so close to my apartment. I'll be coming back here time and time again.

", "This took a while to come out like our entrees, but the presentation made up for it! "], "author": "Anthony N.", "review": "Came here with two of my friends for our last dinner in San Francisco! We walked in and was seated by a friendly server. After looking through the menu, my friends and I went a little crazy and ordered a bunch of food! We ordered the Golden Bags, Tom Yum Soup with Prawns, Beef Pad Kee Mao, Beef Pad Thai, Beef Panang Curry, and Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice. We also ordered Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee, and alcoholic beverages. We were probably thinking, \"Go hard or go home!\" \n\nThe Tom Yum Soup came out first and our server put them in our bowls for us. My friends and I loved it! The Golden Bags came out shortly after and looked awesome. It looked awesome, but I felt as if it was stuffed with too much potatoes and too little chicken. Nothing too special.\n\nThe entrees took a bit while to come out, but we were hanging out with our drinks and chit chatting. When the food came out, our server asked us if we wanted rice with our Panang Curry. It usually comes with rice at other Thai restaurants, so that was an automatic yes from us. He came out with 3 bowls, but that came at a price! We ordered a lot of food, so I wished he took that into consideration (it's okay, it's our last dinner in SF). All entrees were delicious with the perfect amount of heat! After we were completely stuffed, our server took our plates and asked us if we were ready for our Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice. This took a while to come out like our entrees, but the presentation made up for it! The rice was in the middle with thin slices of mango shaped like a heart around it!\n\nOverall, this place is a solid Thai restaurant in San Francisco! Thai food is normally a bit more on the pricey side, but you will always leave stuffed and satisfied!", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I've probably ordered half the menu, but some of my favorites are the spicy eggplant and basil beef, roast duck noodle soup, and panang curry."], "author": "Cynthia M.", "review": "I live really close to this place, so I have found myself coming pretty often, and every time I've left satisfied.

Golden Bags: Sort of like bag shaped egg-rolls filled with potatoes and other goodies! Extremely delicious especially with the sweet and sour sauce it was served with.\n2. Tom Yum: Honestly this was the best tom yum I've ever tasted! It was tangy and warm and sweet and even had a slight kick to it! 1 bowl was not enough.\n3. Pad Kee Mow: One of my favorite Thai dishes, executed to perfection.\n4. Pad Thai: Standard pad thai!\n5. Roasted Duck Curry: I couldn't get enough of this dish. The duck was so flavorful and succulent, and the curry itself was addicting! I poured it all over my rice. Probably my favorite dish of the night.\n6. Spicy Tilapia: I don't usually like fish, but this was pretty good.\n7. Crab Pancake: Loved this! Sadly each person only got a small slice since there were 6 of us, but it left me yearning for more!\n8. Murder Wings: Chef's special! Never tried anything like it. The chicken quality was superb, the sauce on the wings is sort of a lemongrass flavor that just felt like heaven on my palate. I don't know how I was still eating at this point, but I guess my stomach opened up another compartment.\n9. Fried Banana with Buko Ice Cream: First time having buko ice cream and it was great, but the star of the dessert were those deep fried bananas!
