My family and I are huge fans of a great steak dinner, and Cockscomb definitely delivered an experience beyond our expectations. \n\nWe decided to celebrate my dad's birthday on a Monday night, and the restaurant staff was very kind to have a birthday card at the table once we were seated. Once we were seated, the waiter was very friendly and eloquently told us the specials of the day. \n\nAPPETIZERS\n+ Fried squid and pig ears-- This might sound like a strange dish to try, but it was delicious! The pig ears tasted like crispy pig skin chips and the calamari was fried perfectly. I also enjoyed the addition of mint and citrus  to give the dish some brightness. \n\n+ Little Gems Salad--I ordered this salad without expecting anything too amazing (since salads are usually about the same to me), but this salad was so good! The romaine lettuce was crispy, fresh and sweet, and I loved the light vinegarette dressing. They also added fried anchovies and shredded cheese to give the entire dish some saltiness. \n\nENTREES (Shared between 4 people) \n+ Pin Bone Steak--If you're looking to treat yourself and happen to have a party of four with you, get this steak! It was honestly one of the best steaks I have ever had at any restaurant. We ordered it medium rare, and the dry aged quality of the beef definitely proved itself in this dish. The steak was massive, and served with a delicious gravy and bone marrow dip. It also came with some fresh greens and crispy potatoes\n\n+ Tuna Collar--I was skeptical about ordering this dish, since I've never been too impressed by fish collars, but I was blown away by this dish! The tuna collar was massive, and it came decked out with peppercorns, green onions, peppers, and other aromatics. It was cooked in the wood fire, and the meat was tender and fatty.  \n\nOverall, this was an amazing experience and I cannot recommend this restaurant more! The staff was so kind and friendly, and the service was amazing. They were constantly checking up on us, and filling our waters.

Hubs wished the pigs ear was saltier (probably more a la drinking food) but I thought it was perfect!\n* Octopus (daily special) - this dish was indeed special with the thick part of the tentacle being meaty yet tender, the tip of the tentacle being crispy. There was a hint of smokiness and a lovely spicy sauce to go with it. It was served on a bed of divinely crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside potatoes.

They take their protein very seriously (high quality, sustainably and humanely raised) and they don't shy away from bold flavors, which are both huge pluses in my book.\n\nCandice G. describes Cockscomb perfectly: this is where you eat like a Dothraki. Pure bliss as long as you don't limit yourself. \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Wednesday night during dinner peak hours. You'll need to make a reservation because the restaurant gets packed even on week nights. That being said, I made an online reservation the night before, so you won't don't need to plan months or weeks ahead like other restaurants in the city (perhaps you do for a weekend or Friday night reservation).\n\nFirst off, I love the decor of the restaurant. Very rustic furniture, big wooden tables, marble and comfy chairs, with an open kitchen that smells amazing against the cool brisk SF weather. They offer delicious cocktails, including my favorite gin and tonic (with fresh strawberry pur\u00e9e)! They offer sparkling or tap water, or both! Their open bar is pretty amazing with more cocktails than I had time to drink.\n\nFor those of you who haven't been here, Cockscomb is known for big plates New American-Italian style, to share over good conversations with old friends. The portions are meant to be family style and usually my friends and I wouldn't have it any other way. Their menu is decided into: 7 categories (wine and cocktail on separate menu):\n\n\"oysters and shellfish\"\n\"cured and raw\" \n\"starters and salads\" \n\"terrines\" \n\"shared supper\"\n\"offal and butcher's cut\" \n\"daily requirements\". \n\nDaily requirements are side dishes usually vegetables that is cooked in glistening animal fat. Honestly? I wanted to order and eat everything on the menu. Realistically? I'm coming back for more.\n\nBetween my friends and I, we ended up ordering too much food but that is usually as expected haha. The pig hearts were delicious! Definitely bigger, more tender and flavorful than I had thought. For starters, we shared the medium seafood platter of oysters ($48), Tombo crudo (hamachi crudo with interesting Asian inspired textures), pig skins with anchovy, olives and capers (this was amazing!). Both the smaller starters were $16 per.\n\nFor family supper slash big meat, we shared the beef heart tartar ($16), which was so interesting! Meaty, gamey with delicious marinade for the red meat offal. Their special of the night was a huge Wagyu T-bone shared supper. It was huge and smelled amazing. However, having recently returned from Japan where we had prized Wagyu and matsuzake beef, this was far less tasty and did not taste like Japanese Wagyu. While it was around $130, it wasn't nearly as good as what we had in Japanese because this was probably American Wagyu, another breed. It's also to be expected because even Wagyu in Japan is $$$ for a just few strips! Overall, it was still a delicious steak, superior to most I've had in America.\n\nAs for vegetables, our daily requirements were roasted duck fat cauliflower, crispy \"dirty\" potatoes, broccoli di ciccio and mushroom a la greque. All were delicious, well cooked and paired well with our rustic dinner bounty. Each daily requirement ranged around $7-9\n\nFor dessert, which we amazingly made room for, we shared the chocolate torte and another dessert which I don't remember anymore, other than they were tasty but were not mind blowing.\n\nOverall, great meal that is a pricey but nevertheless worth the splurge and experience! It's always a lot of fun to share a huge spread of mouthwatering food, family style, which Cockscomb is great for! Worth a return!

Used it as a spread on grilled bread. Wonderful.\n\n#Octopus A La Plancha - Appetizers ($18): B.\nNot sure about this one.

And the steak itself was bomb! Very, very nicely cooked. Even though the bone size was enormous, every piece of meat I tasted was almost at the same level of rawness (borderline of rare and medium rare). Very juicy, very tender. This dish came with two sauces: bone marrow sauce and red wine sauce. Honestly I could not taste much from the bone marrow sauce, probably the flavor from bone marrow was sort of on the light side. But the red wine sauce was definitely worth to be put on the steak. Some vege that came with this dish definitely helped balanced my stomach a little bit.\n\n#Wood Oven Roasted Pig Head - Shared Supper ($65): A+.\nThis dish alone could have fed another 4 people! What a big head. For anyone that has tried Chinese style roasted pig before this dish actually reminded me exactly that. The skin was crispy (not brittle enough to a point that it would break once you bite on it though) but the meat / fat underneath was WOW. It was actually a huge amount of fat. If it was not cooked properly it would actually feel pretty nasty to put so much fat in your mouth at the same time. Nothing like that from this dish. Very flavorful and the temperature was just about right. The meat tasted like moist pulled pork with lots of flavor too.\n\nSome other notes:\n- Cocktails were great. We tried \"The Towering Inferno\" (gin and ginger beer based) and \"About Cherry Sling\" (gin and cherry based) and both were very refreshing, not too strong and tasted very fruity.\n- Service was wonderful. Our server was wonderful and very attentive, and very energetic when explaining the menu to us. The cocktails above were actually suggested by him, he surely knows what's good there.\n- At the end of our dinner Chef Chris Cosentino walked out from the kitchen, sat down at our table chatted with us for quite a bit of time! He explained his philosophy of this restaurant, his goal about customer experience, what new dish he is working on etc. A very nice and passionate chef. We got to take a picture with him too!\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience with amazing food. I may not be coming back too often because the dishes were just too meaty but if I can manage to gather a big group of friends from out of town, Cockscomb will definitely be the few on top of my list for dinner gathering.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Foie Gras with Trotter and Medium Ripe Strawberries:  ", "A\nA very homestyle dish if I ever tasted one.

I was definitely on the hype train for Cockscomb, given all the great things that I'd heard from friends about it. We came as a group of six, and, unfortunately, had to limit our pork options since one person in our party didn't eat it, leading to orders of the:\n\n* Squid... something - Probably the tastiest dish of the night, which is unfortunate because there were six of us, and one of this little appetizer/side. And, yet, oddly, none of us remember exactly what it was we ordered: I'm inclined to think it was a pasta dish, but don't quote me on that.\n\n* Pig Skin Noodles - My hearing must not be what it once was, because I completely misheard/understood how this dish was prepared, after asking our waiter, thinking it was pig skin inside a noodle dish. But nope, the noodles themselves are actually made from pig skin :o Tasty, and, as you'd expect, incredibly rich and fatty. The texture of the \"noodles\" is, well, chewy and squishy, so prepare yourselves.\n\n* Pin Bone Steak - So, this was the centerpiece. Some tables went with the pig head, some with this, and others with both. Given the aforementioned pork limiter, we opted for the steak, and... any disappointment I had lay almost entirely in this dish. Yes, the quality of the meat was quite good, but our medium rare steak ended up coming out more as a rare steak, and one that seemed unseasoned, almost. I'm not usually one to complain about bland food, since I eat lighter than most, but EVERYONE in our group thought this was bland, even with the provided jus and bone marrow dip. It was bland enough that we had to bust out the salt shaker, which I haven't done since... 15 years ago?\n\n* Panna Cotta - Not something I usually order because, well, I'm lactose intolerant, but that I've somehow probably had more of than any other fancier dessert. And theirs was QUITE delicious, creamy, and rich.\n\nSide dishes aren't enough to save a restaurant, and, while I rarely given two star first experiences a second chance, there's a good chance I will with Cockscomb, since my friends insisted that this was probably a one off fluke. So, until then, 2.5 stars for the place.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak for the main floor of the restaurant, but they do have an elevator that goes up to the second floor, where I'm guessing the larger parties are seated.

A duck egg topped it off.  $11 for a grilled cheese is pretty redick in its own, and while this sandwich was good, it wasn't heavenly by any means.  The honey was a nice touch.  \n\n3.  pin bone steak: 3/5  This is what I came here for, and in terms of presentation, it did not disappoint.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and the bone marrow dip and au jus were ono grindz to the extreme.  However, beyond the presentation, the meat was a little too chewy.  Pin bone cuts are the most succulent of the sirloin steaks, however, this dish did not meet that billing.  I left Cockscomb -$110 for this steak as well as a jawache.  \n\nWe got some other dishes like halibut and some desserts.  To me, the dessert did not even qualify as a dessert.  One was an apple covered in a mountain of cheese...ehhhhh.  The second was some blank cake.  \n\nI really wanted to like Cockscomb.  The decor and motif of this place is super legit.  However, the food was lacking to me, especially for that price tag.  When you leave an eatery with a very light pocket and bummed out taste buds, that is pretty much the worse combo.

I was visiting SF at the time and my good friend Lorrie, who is a Yelp Elite for 10+ years probably and had over 3000 reviews suggested this place. The restaurant is located in SoMa and as we walked in I immediately loved the place, the ambience, which to me felt like rusty industrial meets modern chill. We sat on the top floor by the windows and before we got started, thoroghly enjoyed watching dishes getting served to the large/long table next to us, one of them being a huge slab of medium rare steak which looked amazing. We each looked through the menu and ended up ordering the following: Beef Heart Tartare, Raw Halibut with Jalapeno Peppers, \"Hot Mess\" Seared Foie Gras, and the Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head. Delicious!\n\nI'm just going to dive into ranking and reviewing the dishes: 1. Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head: this dish was HUGE, and both me and Lorrie loved it. The pig's head was so crispy on the outside, especially the ears, and soooo tender on the inside. Probably the most tender pork I have tasted in a long time. 2. \"Hot Mess\" Seared Foie gras: you can never go wrong with Foie gras - it was delish as usual. Not sure about the beef patty/cake on the bottom though. 3. Raw Halibut with Jalapeno Peppers: it was sooo tasty and refreshing! There is something about raw fish and olive oil, lemon/lime juice, and peppers. 4. Beef Heart Tartare: it was good but not amazing, and it really was nothing special. \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience and delicious food. Although the dishes were a lot for 2 people.

And it definitely did not disappoint. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Shaved vegetables - I wanted something fresh and earthy, and that's exactly what I got. Shaved radishes, daikon, carrots, arugula etc. in a light vinaigrette. So delicious and light.\n- Tombo ceviche - I loved the flavor in this dish. I reminded me a lot of a Thai dish with the very strong lime flavor with the Thai red pepper. Very delicious and fresh.\n- Roasted milk fed chicken - The bf ordered this, and it was the \"best chicken he's ever had\". It was so juicy and flavorful. It also came with a side of asparagus, which complimented the chicken well.\n- Coulette steak - loved my steak. Coming from Texas, it's hard for me to find good steak. It was very well cooked (medium-rare), and tender I could use my fork to cut it! I also really loved the vegetables it came with (radishes, pearl onions, etc.)\n- Duck fat cauliflower - We were being pigs and our waitress had to tell us \"this should be enough\". But this was a great addition, and we were happy we made it! Very tender and flavorful. \n\nOverall, a really great meal.

Anyway walking in, the restaurant has a warm feeling.  Maybe it's the open kitchen on a cold winter night and the big animal head that hung over head (I think it was a moose) but has a cabin like kind of feeling.  Once we checked in we were seated right away in a communal like table where they used a few jars of buddha hands to divide up the two parties.  Since my brother and I have been eyeing the menu for a bit, we knew what we wanted to order and our parents are pretty easy so we ordered uni butter with crab bruschetta, greens and herbs, little gem salad, beef heart tartare, medium shellfish platter, pin bone steak, sole, quail, and 18 layer crepe (I think it was 18).\n\nThe bruschetta was good but it was not worth $19.  I didn't taste too much crab or uni and the bread was too chewy for our liking.  The beef heart tartare was a good dish both in portion and taste.  Again the bread that came with it (since they use the same bread) was a bit too tough and chewy.  One thing I didn't appreciate was when we asked for additional bread, they charged us for it which is a bit absurd (2 slices for $1).  The two salads I thought were actually pretty tasty as it wasn't over dressed and decent in portion.  The medium shellfish platter at $48 was enough for us.  A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\nFor the entrees, I thought the quail was ridiculously over priced.  Two small pieces of meat for $35 was a rip off.  It was good but not worth $35 good.  We had a quail a few weeks ago at another place, while I don't remember the price (it was close, may be a bit less) there was definitely more meat to it.  The sold was a little bit more filling but could have used more seasoning I thought.  The main attraction, the pin bone steak was actually very generous in size.  There was more than enough for all of us but my brother and I both agreed it needed more flavor.  The beef jus that came with it was average and the bone marrow sauce was pure oil.  While I understand that eating meat on the medium rare side is generally how it's supposed to be, I would have appreciated if the waiter asked if that is okay.  \n\nOverall service was above average as they checked in on us often, made sure we had enough water.  One minor complaint is that if you have a special or something that says market price, let us know the price and don't wait for us to ask.  It's not a big deal but just something i appreciate.\n\nFor dessert the crepe had just the right amount of sweetness but it could be too much for one person as we shared it.\n\nWhy am I giving it 3.5 stars and rounding it down to three?  Overall I think the restaurant is a bit over priced.  We ended up paying $100 a person and I think at a $100 a person, we can probably do fine dining.

Not overly flavorful but very mild. If you didn't know it was beef heart, you'd never be able to tell. The pate was okay. It had more texture than I'd expect but flavor wise, it wasn't bad.

I definitely rate this dish an okay and would not be ordering it again. \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was the pig's head. It smelled heavenly and it was cooked to perfection. The skin was super crispy and the meat was fall off the bone melt in your mouth. But it was not seasoned!!! At all!! I looked around the table for salt and pepper shaker but did not see any. I normally never add salt to my food at restaurants. Never. But I needed some desperately for this meal. The head came with two \"sauces\": a white sauce made with brains and a salsa verde made with drippings. I didn't try the white sauce but the salsa verde was a complete fail. It too had no seasoning, just a tanginess and oiliness which was totally not necessary considering the pig's head is pretty much all fat. \n\nI came into this meal knowing it was super rich and fatty but had it had flavor, I would not have been disappointed. I understand that the inside of the pig's head would have been hard to season but the skin was bland and the accompanying sauces were bland. It was bland fat on fat. \n\nThe mushrooms, on the other hand, were utterly divine! Simply delicious. I could have eaten a tub of that. The cauliflower was also delicious. \n\nWe were also very pleased with the cocktails. Best cocktails I've ever had and we had the special house made ones which usually aren't great but these were really really good, especially the Sweet November. It was sweet with a slight but pleasant bitterness. \n\nThe service was a bit on the slow side but it was a packed house. Our meal took 3 hours to finish. \n\nOverall, I'm not sure I'd go back. We've had the leg of beast at his other restaurant that closed, Incanto, and we loved it. So we really expected this meal to be on par and it just didn't live up. \n\nThe sides and cocktails are what made this a 3-star experience for me.

Pretty much, this is the seat where I was drooling over all the items I didn't order, but wanted to... like this MASSIVE pin bone steak with bone marrow dip.\n\nThis is Chris Cosentino's latest restaurant in San Francisco. He's the winner of Top Chef Masters and even had his own show on the Food Network (Chefs VS. City).\n\nFor all you meat lovers and red-blooded carnivores, this is where you NEED to be. Trust me. The menu reflects Cosentino's background in butchery and his love of offal is obvious: there's even a wood oven-roasted pig's head on the menu.\n\nSide: The HUGE pig head kinda freaks me out, so if I'm feeling a bit more ballzy next time... I might order it.\n\nNow moving onto the food, here's what we had:\n\n+ Beef heart tartare is unlike anything I've ever had ($16). It comes with a helping of arugula and seasoned potatoes which were so on point! The quality of the meat was super fresh and it got me really excited for everything else to come. It's probably one of the best appetizers on the menu.\n\n+ Crudo of the day ($16) was dressed similar to a ceviche style, using lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos were added for a nice kick, and cucumbers brought a crispness to each bite.\n\n+ OMG this bacon chop ($32). Ok, so.....this thing is huge! Every bite was super tender and it's perfectly grilled and juicy on the inside. We couldn't finish half of it since the other dishes were pretty large as well.\n\nIt was honestly one of the best bacon chops ever, but I found it a little toooo fatty (I had to remove the fat to prevent next-day bloating and meat sweats).\n\n+ This quail tetrazzini ($35) is absolutely heavenly! The quail was deliciously tender and the creme fraiche went perfect with it. I thought it was the best thing of the night: juicy, flavorful, melted off the bones. The garnishes also added a nice crunch to each bite. This is a MUST GET.\n\nAnd if you happen to come here with a vegetarian (not sure why you would), but this whole roasted branzino ($35)  is a great option.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nCockscomb is the kind of place where you go with friends (meat lovers). And when the food comes out, everyone stops talking. It's time to eat.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here with only my boyfriend. So we ended up sitting at the counter while drooling over everyone else's food.\n\nThe tartare and quail are MUST GETS. If you're feeling adventurous, get the roasted pigs head (they only make a certain amount and they run out every night).\n\nFor more pics and deets, visit: http://cyneats.com/cockscomb/", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Crudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now.

"], "author": "Crystal V.", "review": "With all the mixed reviews, I came here slightly hopeful--but with a somewhat of a low expectation. My dining mate and I had reservations but we came early and were able to be seated right away. We came around the beginning of dinner service so we were one of the few patrons there, however when we left, it was really crowded. The ambiance and the music was really good. Tables are really close together as most SF restaurants are so that was pretty understandable. Our server [Justin I think?] was really on point in describing the specials and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. Coming in with an idea of what we wanted-- we ordered barely any of those because of his great recommendations.\n\nOysters: For $3 each and a minimum of 1/2 a dozen, we stuck to the west coast oysters because  I generally like the smaller ones more. Nothing really stuck out about the oysters so I'd probably recommend skipping it. Its very easy to find fresh oysters in the city so you're probably better off saving room for other yummies.\n\nCrudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now. It was dressed similar to a ceviche style with nice lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos for a nice kick, and cucumbers to bring a crispness to it. A good dish, but again, not something I'd order again only because you can find this almost anywhere in the city.\n\nBeef heart tartare: YUM. Get this. I was pretty disappointed that ours didn't have a quail egg that I've seen boasted everywhere online/yelp. Ours came with a mustard-y sauce that didn't really add anything to the dish except make it easier to mix? This dish comes with two pieces of crostini/toast so my dining mate and I each got one. I went for the route where you slab a heavy layer of the beef heart tartare on and spread it then top it off with the arugula. The arugula was seasoned really salty by itself, but together with everything it was a beautiful dish. This is probably the best way to approach this dish. It comes with a helping of their seasoned potatoes which were also on point! The crispy skin was so nicely seasoned and not over powering. The potatoes were cooked just right so they still had a nice texture without being too starchy. \n\nLittle Gems: Needing some greens to go with our meal we opted for this salad with fried pig ears. I let my mate eat most of the pig ear because they weren't that special to me. I really enjoyed the salad and munched on that. The dressing was really nice and I don't know if its because I haven't allowed myself to have salad dressing in a long time, but I couldn't put my fork down! However towards the bottom of the salad it was pretty drenched making the salad lose its crisp. Maybe opt for the dressing on the side next time.\n\nGrilled Cheese with Truffles: My mate loves grilled cheese. He loves cheese, period. When looking at the menu the night before he said he was probably going to pass on this dish, but upon hearing about how it is there most popular dish, he changed his mind. I am so happy he did! It ended up being a really good dish and one of the top dishes of the night. Judging the pictures doesn't do this dish justice. The beautiful art of having the right consistency for a grilled cheese is really important. Cheese ratio-- not valid because the more the better. The toast complimented the cheese in its beautifully browned texture. The secret to this dish is not the truffles that are on top, but the honey that is used. With a taste in every bite, it was well rounded and delicious. Not overpoweringly sweet, but made a beautiful sweet symphony with the cheese. This portion of the meal was quiet due to the lovemaking of the sandwich and I. \n\nButchers Choice: Clam linguine with pork belly-- This dish was okay. I have been craving pasta for awhile so I thought this dish would help satisfy that craving. Sadly it did not. The texture of the linguine noodles were definitely different and was borderline udon noodles. The sauce was a lime citrus sauce that was really one note. I had to ask for some crush red peppers to give this baby a kick. The clams were okay and I didn't really find any pork belly. Pretty oily and would probably recommend skipping.\n\nButchers Choice: Hot mess-- YISSSSS. YES YES YES. Foie gras on top with a beef patty/croquette it seemed. My mate found the beef patty to have too much going on with a strange consistency, however when he spread the foie gras over it, turned his world upside down. Like, moment of silence, put your fork and knife down good delicious. This ritual happened after every single bite. I don't need to write much on this dish to convince you to get this because you know when theres silence at a dining table, theres magic.\n\nThough we left room for dessert, none of the options were really that impressive.

The pig ear was so delightfully crispy and perfectly seasoned, and the squid wasn't tough in the slightest. The citrus, mint, and chili was a really beautiful compliment to everything.\n\n- Beef heart tartare: Enjoyed the tartare, but wasn't a fan of the grilled bread, which is probably my only negative criticism of the meal. The slices of grilled bread were just too big and just overpowered the taste of the tartare.\n\n- \"Hot Mess\" off-menu special: I wish I remembered the full details of this, but all I can recall is that it involved foie gras. Yum. It was delicious and rich as you'd expect. My only wish was that we ate it faster because it got cold fairly quickly.\n\n- Carrots with lebne + duck fat cauliflower: Great little sides that provided some fiber to a very carnivorous meal.\n\n- Roasted pigs head: A HUGE highlight of the dinner. It felt so primal seeing that entire half pigs head, eyeball and all, and then digging into it with our knives and forks. The skin was to die for - Amazingly crispy, crunchy, & savory. The meat was so tender that once you ate the skin, all the meat underneath just fell apart with a slight touch of the fork, and every part from the eye to the cheek tasted deliciously savory, rich, and all around just perfect. A bonus - A brain aioli dipping sauce for all of the skin and meat. Honestly this was one of the most decadent and most pleasurable eating experiences of my life. I took some of the leftover meat home and made fried rice with it the next day (highly recommend)\n\nOn top of all of this, service was fantastic, and our server was very attentive and friendly.\n\nI absolutely plan to go back to try some of their other unique meat-centric dishes like the whole duck or meat pie.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-03-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Starting with mixed oysters, we then tried the crispy squid and pig ears (the grapefruit was a touch of genius in here), and the beef heart tartare (wonderful).

Good selection of beers I'll say. \n\nWe got the gnocchi. 8 pieces for $9. Conclusion = waste of $9. Nothing wrong with them but I felt like I was just eating uncooked pizza dough covered in olive oil. \n\nGot the special waygu ribeye with dirty crispy potatoes and roasted corn. The corn was very good and had great flavor. The crispy potatoes were crunchy but not burnt and had the roasted pepper flavor. Sides were great. The waygu ribeye, which was the centerpiece of the dinner, was a huge disappointment. The waygu ribeye (see picture below) can easily feed 2-3 people. I would say two. It was priced at around $160. For that price and all the hype I heard, I expected more. \n\nThe steak was plated nicely in that it was on a huge wood board and overwhelmingly showered with peppers & potatoes. It was as if they were trying to hide something...the disappointment perhaps? It was all show. The few inner strips of the steak were cooked well, but the outer strips and edges were under-cooked and resulted in being very chewy. The steak itself was not hot/warm and borderline cold. Outside of the basic salt and pepper seasoning, this had nothing else. \n\nI understand sometimes you just want to savor the steak itself; however, for $160 and all the hype, in addition to the steak being unevenly cooked & cold, this steak was a miss. For a restaurant to be known for its meats, they failed to deliver. What we received was merely presentation and quantity rather than quality. The meat/steak is a chef's/restaurant's canvas and what you do with it, separates you from the rest. The end resulting canvas can be found at TJ Maxx HomeGoods. Nothing wrong there, I shop there. I don't believe they did anything different to separate themselves from any other restaurant or warrant the premium prices.\n\nI wouldn't come back here again not because the food was bad, but mainly because you're overpaying for the quality you get.

The tuna collar was described to us as being braised on a bed of aromatics, when it came to the table it was indeed on a veritable medley of stuff with varying degrees of edibility. There was roasted garlic but only the smaller cloves were cooked the larger ones were straight up lumps of raw garlic, the dish was also sprinkled with pink peppercorns which were also inedible, I felt that it was an appetizer minefield and was scared to take bites in case I was unfortunate enough to encounter something I didn't want to swallow, I will also say this dish was also lacking salt. Be careful what you wish for though because the entrees arrived and suddenly it became apparent what the kitchen had been holding on to the salt for. Three of us at the table got the coulotte steak, it looked great but the very first bite of the meat proved so salty I immediately started looking around for our server, the rest of the steak orderers were also pushing their plates away from them. Our server was great and asked if we would like the same dishes but with less salt, I opted to try the fennel sausage instead and the other two switched out to the pasta with bottarga dish.\nAbout 15 minutes later out comes my sausage entree which was basically a sausage with a side salad....odd. One bite of the sausage and it was salt lick city all over again and if anything it was even saltier than the steak (which I considered to be only slightly less saline than the Dead Sea). Also oddly one of my dinner companions pasta was ok and the other one was also off the charts salty.\nNeedless to say at this point we cut our losses and asked for the check, the server was gracious enough to not charge us for any of the disastrous entrees.\nAnother thing that spoiled the experience for me was the constant yelling out of tickets by the expediter, is it really necessary to be so loud, I mean people are trying to talk and not get PTSD from the constant shouting. Maybe instead of yelling he could have put his mouth to better use by tasting the food that was leaving the kitchen?\nThe whole experience was solely redeemed by the professionalism of the front of house staff.

Thanks for the excellent food!\n\nCame here for a birthday dinner on Saturday night. We had a reservation for 5 and I was the first to arrive 15 mins early, but our table was already ready and after I was brought there, the staff showed me where the bar was and suggested I could either hangout at the bar and waited at the table. Very thoughtful service!\n\nIt's not a big menu but all the dishes names sound very tempting. And since it is so hard to decide.... we just went ahead with the \"Shared Supper\" items and got both of them plus two other appetizers.\n\n#Beef Heart Tartare - Appetizers ($16): A.\nBeef tartare is pretty common but beef heart? It turned out to be pretty delicious. The meat definitely contained a lot more fat, and the texture was more smooth than regular beef tartare. I actually almost felt like eating fatty tuna tartare. Used it as a spread on grilled bread. Wonderful.\n\n#Octopus A La Plancha - Appetizers ($18): B.\nNot sure about this one. Portion was very small, and there were only few pieces of octopus plus some vegetables. Not recommended.\n\n#Pin Bone Steak - Shared Supper ($110): A+.\nFirst off, the price did justify at least from the portion point of view - this dish alone could have fed 6 people. And the steak itself was bomb! Very, very nicely cooked. Even though the bone size was enormous, every piece of meat I tasted was almost at the same level of rawness (borderline of rare and medium rare). Very juicy, very tender. This dish came with two sauces: bone marrow sauce and red wine sauce. Honestly I could not taste much from the bone marrow sauce, probably the flavor from bone marrow was sort of on the light side. But the red wine sauce was definitely worth to be put on the steak. Some vege that came with this dish definitely helped balanced my stomach a little bit.\n\n#Wood Oven Roasted Pig Head - Shared Supper ($65): A+.\nThis dish alone could have fed another 4 people! What a big head. For anyone that has tried Chinese style roasted pig before this dish actually reminded me exactly that. The skin was crispy (not brittle enough to a point that it would break once you bite on it though) but the meat / fat underneath was WOW. It was actually a huge amount of fat. If it was not cooked properly it would actually feel pretty nasty to put so much fat in your mouth at the same time. Nothing like that from this dish. Very flavorful and the temperature was just about right. The meat tasted like moist pulled pork with lots of flavor too.\n\nSome other notes:\n- Cocktails were great. We tried \"The Towering Inferno\" (gin and ginger beer based) and \"About Cherry Sling\" (gin and cherry based) and both were very refreshing, not too strong and tasted very fruity.\n- Service was wonderful. Our server was wonderful and very attentive, and very energetic when explaining the menu to us. The cocktails above were actually suggested by him, he surely knows what's good there.\n- At the end of our dinner Chef Chris Cosentino walked out from the kitchen, sat down at our table chatted with us for quite a bit of time! He explained his philosophy of this restaurant, his goal about customer experience, what new dish he is working on etc. A very nice and passionate chef. We got to take a picture with him too!\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience with amazing food. I may not be coming back too often because the dishes were just too meaty but if I can manage to gather a big group of friends from out of town, Cockscomb will definitely be the few on top of my list for dinner gathering.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["The beef heart tartare was delicious, but not for the faint of heart...

The open kitchen makes the dimly lit room more lively and exciting than your standard $$$ dining room.\n\nBut really, this place is about the food...and when I mean food I mean the different meat platters!!!  Okay, so we started off with the Grilled Cheese with Egg and Honey.  As far grilled cheeses go, you really can't get better than this.  Well you can, I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't the Truffle Grilled cheese I saw in pics on yelp, but I guess its not truffle season. Never the less, excellent grilled cheese.  The next dish was the pig ears and cabbage salad.  Similar to a Vietnamese salad dish, it was a bit tangy and spicy.  However, I probably would have enjoyed the pig ears by themselves, without all the cabbage and dressing.\n\nAfter wetting our appetites, we continued on to the heavier plates.  The beef heart tartare was delicious, but not for the faint of heart...  BEEFY is the best way to describe the flavor and the bread was perfectly grilled and buttered!  SO GOOD!  The butcher's choice was lamb heart with yellow zucchini.  It was well seasoned and cooked, but it just wasn't my thing.\n\nThe main event featured the heavy weight of the heavy weights!  Pine Bone Steak with Bone Marrow Dip!  The steak took a while, but after the seeing the size of it, you understand why.  Must have been at least 3 pounds!  The charring and seasoning was excellent.  The edges were a bit over cooked but it was darn near perfect the rest of the way.  The bone marrow dip was so flavorful and added an extra kick for your taste buds.  Of course the Au Jus kept it moist and juicy!  \n\nOverall, I loved the experience at Cockscomb!  Will definitely come back for the pig's head!!!

We came on a Wednesday night at 6:30 PM and the restaurant was already full. For all you meatlovers and daredevils, this is heaven. The meal was so meat-heavy that I didn't crave meat for days. Actually, I ate so much that the thought of meat made me uncomfortable. The menu offers pretty much any part of the animal that you can think of. Like pig skin, pig trotters, beef heart tartare, tons of liver, and pig head so get ready for an adventurous meal! \n\nThe setting works perfectly for large groups especially when you're trying to share a whole chicken, a 4 lb. sirloin, and 10 other dishes. But this is not to say that you shouldn't come here on a date night. Just be prepared to eat and unbutton your pants after 15 minutes. \n\n-- Orders --\n----------------\n- Special: 4 Lb. Bone in Sirloin [Recommend - Best dish of the night!] \n- Special: Whole chicken (including the feet and the head) in a pot with potatoes, carrots, and shallots\n- \"Hot Mess\" Pig Trotters with Foie Gras & Strawberries [Recommend]\n- Halibut Crudo\n- Oysters\n- Roasted eggplant\n- Bacon Chop with peaches and greens [Recommend - very nicely spiced]\n- Oven Roasted Beets\n- Summer Squash\n- Butcher's choice: Pig skin spaghetti (which actually had a chewy texture like spaghetti) \n- Dessert: Fruit \"Cobbler\" [Recommend - Perfect conclusion]\n- Dessert: \"Panna Cotta\"\n- Dessert: A type of \"Chocolate\" Mousse\n----------------\n\nAll the \"Supper\" and \"Shared Supper\" items were huge. The 4 lb sirloin is a must-get if you have a big enough group to finish it. They included foie gras and something that resembles fermented and spiced cabbage. We had eight people in the group to devour this and paired it with veggies like the eggplant and the squash for a more balanced dinner. The foie gras with the strawberries was succulent!! I loved the strawberries..It worked really well with the foie gras and the trotters. Everything melts in your mouth. \n\nOh, and you have to get a dessert, no matter how full you are. The fruit cobbler was soooooo good! There were some granola or oat crumbs with a variety of baked fruit. It was my second favorite thing after the sirloin which left a lasting impression. Because not only is the meat good...but the desserts are also spectacular. \n\nI regret not ordering the bruschetta, pig head, beef heart tartare, and the grilled cheese. But I'll be back!!

Pretty much, this is the seat where I was drooling over all the items I didn't order, but wanted to... like this MASSIVE pin bone steak with bone marrow dip.\n\nThis is Chris Cosentino's latest restaurant in San Francisco. He's the winner of Top Chef Masters and even had his own show on the Food Network (Chefs VS. City).\n\nFor all you meat lovers and red-blooded carnivores, this is where you NEED to be. Trust me. The menu reflects Cosentino's background in butchery and his love of offal is obvious: there's even a wood oven-roasted pig's head on the menu.\n\nSide: The HUGE pig head kinda freaks me out, so if I'm feeling a bit more ballzy next time... I might order it.\n\nNow moving onto the food, here's what we had:\n\n+ Beef heart tartare is unlike anything I've ever had ($16). It comes with a helping of arugula and seasoned potatoes which were so on point! The quality of the meat was super fresh and it got me really excited for everything else to come. It's probably one of the best appetizers on the menu.\n\n+ Crudo of the day ($16) was dressed similar to a ceviche style, using lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos were added for a nice kick, and cucumbers brought a crispness to each bite.\n\n+ OMG this bacon chop ($32). Ok, so.....this thing is huge! Every bite was super tender and it's perfectly grilled and juicy on the inside. We couldn't finish half of it since the other dishes were pretty large as well.\n\nIt was honestly one of the best bacon chops ever, but I found it a little toooo fatty (I had to remove the fat to prevent next-day bloating and meat sweats).\n\n+ This quail tetrazzini ($35) is absolutely heavenly! The quail was deliciously tender and the creme fraiche went perfect with it. I thought it was the best thing of the night: juicy, flavorful, melted off the bones. The garnishes also added a nice crunch to each bite. This is a MUST GET.\n\nAnd if you happen to come here with a vegetarian (not sure why you would), but this whole roasted branzino ($35)  is a great option.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nCockscomb is the kind of place where you go with friends (meat lovers). And when the food comes out, everyone stops talking. It's time to eat.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here with only my boyfriend. So we ended up sitting at the counter while drooling over everyone else's food.\n\nThe tartare and quail are MUST GETS.

My dining mate and I had reservations but we came early and were able to be seated right away. We came around the beginning of dinner service so we were one of the few patrons there, however when we left, it was really crowded. The ambiance and the music was really good. Tables are really close together as most SF restaurants are so that was pretty understandable. Our server [Justin I think?] was really on point in describing the specials and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. Coming in with an idea of what we wanted-- we ordered barely any of those because of his great recommendations.\n\nOysters: For $3 each and a minimum of 1/2 a dozen, we stuck to the west coast oysters because  I generally like the smaller ones more. Nothing really stuck out about the oysters so I'd probably recommend skipping it. Its very easy to find fresh oysters in the city so you're probably better off saving room for other yummies.\n\nCrudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now. It was dressed similar to a ceviche style with nice lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos for a nice kick, and cucumbers to bring a crispness to it. A good dish, but again, not something I'd order again only because you can find this almost anywhere in the city.\n\nBeef heart tartare: YUM. Get this. I was pretty disappointed that ours didn't have a quail egg that I've seen boasted everywhere online/yelp. Ours came with a mustard-y sauce that didn't really add anything to the dish except make it easier to mix? This dish comes with two pieces of crostini/toast so my dining mate and I each got one. I went for the route where you slab a heavy layer of the beef heart tartare on and spread it then top it off with the arugula. The arugula was seasoned really salty by itself, but together with everything it was a beautiful dish. This is probably the best way to approach this dish. It comes with a helping of their seasoned potatoes which were also on point! The crispy skin was so nicely seasoned and not over powering. The potatoes were cooked just right so they still had a nice texture without being too starchy. \n\nLittle Gems: Needing some greens to go with our meal we opted for this salad with fried pig ears. I let my mate eat most of the pig ear because they weren't that special to me. I really enjoyed the salad and munched on that. The dressing was really nice and I don't know if its because I haven't allowed myself to have salad dressing in a long time, but I couldn't put my fork down! However towards the bottom of the salad it was pretty drenched making the salad lose its crisp. Maybe opt for the dressing on the side next time.\n\nGrilled Cheese with Truffles: My mate loves grilled cheese. He loves cheese, period. When looking at the menu the night before he said he was probably going to pass on this dish, but upon hearing about how it is there most popular dish, he changed his mind. I am so happy he did! It ended up being a really good dish and one of the top dishes of the night. Judging the pictures doesn't do this dish justice. The beautiful art of having the right consistency for a grilled cheese is really important. Cheese ratio-- not valid because the more the better. The toast complimented the cheese in its beautifully browned texture. The secret to this dish is not the truffles that are on top, but the honey that is used. With a taste in every bite, it was well rounded and delicious. Not overpoweringly sweet, but made a beautiful sweet symphony with the cheese. This portion of the meal was quiet due to the lovemaking of the sandwich and I. \n\nButchers Choice: Clam linguine with pork belly-- This dish was okay. I have been craving pasta for awhile so I thought this dish would help satisfy that craving. Sadly it did not. The texture of the linguine noodles were definitely different and was borderline udon noodles. The sauce was a lime citrus sauce that was really one note. I had to ask for some crush red peppers to give this baby a kick. The clams were okay and I didn't really find any pork belly. Pretty oily and would probably recommend skipping.\n\nButchers Choice: Hot mess-- YISSSSS. YES YES YES. Foie gras on top with a beef patty/croquette it seemed. My mate found the beef patty to have too much going on with a strange consistency, however when he spread the foie gras over it, turned his world upside down. Like, moment of silence, put your fork and knife down good delicious. This ritual happened after every single bite. I don't need to write much on this dish to convince you to get this because you know when theres silence at a dining table, theres magic.\n\nThough we left room for dessert, none of the options were really that impressive.

If you are a big liver fan you will enjoy it, but if you are at all on the fence about such things it might be a pass. It comes with some jammed fruit and thick toast to help balance it, but the ratio leaves not enough bread. Had to ask for additional slices to finish it.\n\nThe pin bone steak was huge and would have fed four people as a main entree. The cool factor in this dish was it being served with a chefs knife; very empowering. It was good, but not remarkable as far as on the bone large cuts go.

The steak knives were very sleek Shun knives, which made the meat like a cloud to cut through, really excellent cutlery. \n\nThe desert was phenomenal, and was only $7.

None of them major, but for the price of the restaurant they added up. We arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table.

Ordered a coffee after dinner and it hadn't come by the end of desert, so we just canceled it. Also we ordered an additional side of bread to finish the terrine and they charged $1 for it. It seems petty to see a one dollar line item for bread on a $300 bill. On the plus side, there was a miscommunication on what we ordered for one of the dishes and they took it off the bill, nice touch.\n\nOverall would recommend this place out of the sheer uniqueness of the food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Beef heart tartare - interestingly springy, on the border of being spongy, but a lighter version of its typical predecessor.

Although they have some good veggie dishes but you are here for the meat and seafood. We (4) came here on a busy Sat evening, place is packed by 6pm and it is pretty loud. Very cool setting and you can see the chef working hard with his kitchen staff to prepare that delicious meal for you. \n\nWe started with cherrystone clams from WA, pretty good, very sweet, followed by the special of that night, which is fore gars, the fg itself is pretty small, buried under some shredded pork, not too bad. Then comes the beef heart tartare,I am not sure if this dish is really raw beef heart but it tastes great! it goes really well with the grilled bread. after that we had the bone marrow, I am not a big fan of it but my friends really enjoyed it. \n\nThen the waiter clear the table and about 20 min wait, comes the roasted pig head, they say it is for 2 to 3 people to share but we had plenty of left overs after we were done with it. I think maybe I was expecting a lot, since this is kind of like their signature dish, but sadly I only took couple bites of the skin and meat then that was it for me, any more I would throw up. I guess it is the greasiness...The skin was not that crispy, and it kinda stick to your teeth, for me I had to scrape off the fat attached to the skin, otherwise I don't think i can eat it. The other part is that you have to dig through all the fat under the skin in order to get to some lean meat and the digging part is kinda of... I don't know, it is just not for me. The dish came with some dipping sauce, it is pig's brain mixed with mayonnaise or they called it brainaise, not a big fan of it. There is also some sauce that dripped off the pig's head when roasting it, the chef mix it with some herbs which you can dip the skin or meat with it, again not a big fan of it. To be honest I wish the chef used the hoisin sauce as one of the dipping sauce, it would take some of the greasiness away... just a suggestion. The pig's ear that came with it was deep fried a bit, therefor very crispy and I like it a lot.\n\nAlmost all the meat dishes come with some good portion of veggies. My wife had the little gem salad and it was pretty good. She also had the quail with mushroom (she was not too fond of the pig's head), and she loved it, I tried it too and I would choose the quail over pig's head. \n\nI think I will be back couple more times just to try other dishes on the menu.

Is the celebrity chef a figurehead who never sets foot in a kitchen and is an absent owner? Or is the chef actively running the kitchen and we truly experience what they are about? No such worries at Cockscomb as chef Chris Cosentino was working hard on both sides of the pass to produce satisfying and comforting food.\n\nIt's hard enough to get people to eat raw beef. It's harder to get people to eat raw cow heart. Definitely need to attract daring diners to order the beef heart tartare. But those who take risks get the rewards. As my favorite dish of the night, the tartare mixture nicely balanced the \"pow\" of the heart with enough acidic \"zing\". The \"duck liver croquet en bouche\" starter had incredibly flavorful duck liver piped into a baked puff. I would have loved the dish except it had entirely too much sweet strawberry jam that buried the superb liver.\n\nThe entr\u00e9es were slightly homey. The tetrazzini included an entire roasted Cornish game hen topped with mushrooms, crunchy fried fideos, and cream sauce. Typically, scant and dry, this hen was meaty and tender. It surprisingly didn't loose its crisp skin in the sauce. For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered a \"zampini\" without knowing what it was. (I later did a web search. Google directed me to a Brazilian actress and Wikipedia to an Indian village. This means I should have eaten a sexy starlet or an entire Asian village like Godzilla.) What I actually ate was a grilled sausage with plenty of corn on the side. Topped with two gutty fried oysters, the ingredients never felt cohesive and the dish was oily.\n\nWe didn't have dessert because I was full from cleaning our plates. I don't like to waste food. Speaking of waste, we saw a couple of orders of \"pin steak\" which was served on a board that barely fit the table. I don't know how many pounds it was, but it's a roast that would probably serve six people. Unfortunately, I saw two boards go back to the kitchen only half finished. I sure hope the restaurant has a good plan for sizable amounts of uneaten meat otherwise that was a shameful waste, but they should consider serving a smaller portion.\n\nThe red wines by the glass were curiously South American, but appropriate given the amount of heavy red meats.\n\nThe menu had a \"Butcher's Choice\" of \"Daily Fall Offs\". Considering they have beef heart, I was expecting some crazy and fun parts like lamb brain, pig pancreas, boar dong, or anything with the word \"knuckle\" in it. Basically, something that would rival the banquet in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Sadly, the leftover cuts were the premium foie gras. Furthermore, if someone from PETA heard that the force feeding of fowl yielded what is considered a fall off, it would likely anger them even more.\n\nThere was a 4% pretax surcharge for \"San Francisco employer mandate\", although I'm not sure why some places charge this while others do not. Parking in this seemingly industrial area was oddly high at $7 per hour due do \"event parking rates\" when no major event was in sight.\n\nThe name of the restaurant is a little personal. How someone combs their privates is not my concern (hence the term \"privates\").

Anyway walking in, the restaurant has a warm feeling.  Maybe it's the open kitchen on a cold winter night and the big animal head that hung over head (I think it was a moose) but has a cabin like kind of feeling.  Once we checked in we were seated right away in a communal like table where they used a few jars of buddha hands to divide up the two parties.  Since my brother and I have been eyeing the menu for a bit, we knew what we wanted to order and our parents are pretty easy so we ordered uni butter with crab bruschetta, greens and herbs, little gem salad, beef heart tartare, medium shellfish platter, pin bone steak, sole, quail, and 18 layer crepe (I think it was 18).\n\nThe bruschetta was good but it was not worth $19.  I didn't taste too much crab or uni and the bread was too chewy for our liking.  The beef heart tartare was a good dish both in portion and taste.  Again the bread that came with it (since they use the same bread) was a bit too tough and chewy.  One thing I didn't appreciate was when we asked for additional bread, they charged us for it which is a bit absurd (2 slices for $1).  The two salads I thought were actually pretty tasty as it wasn't over dressed and decent in portion.  The medium shellfish platter at $48 was enough for us.  A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\nFor the entrees, I thought the quail was ridiculously over priced.  Two small pieces of meat for $35 was a rip off.  It was good but not worth $35 good.  We had a quail a few weeks ago at another place, while I don't remember the price (it was close, may be a bit less) there was definitely more meat to it.  The sold was a little bit more filling but could have used more seasoning I thought.  The main attraction, the pin bone steak was actually very generous in size.  There was more than enough for all of us but my brother and I both agreed it needed more flavor.  The beef jus that came with it was average and the bone marrow sauce was pure oil.  While I understand that eating meat on the medium rare side is generally how it's supposed to be, I would have appreciated if the waiter asked if that is okay.  \n\nOverall service was above average as they checked in on us often, made sure we had enough water.  One minor complaint is that if you have a special or something that says market price, let us know the price and don't wait for us to ask.  It's not a big deal but just something i appreciate.\n\nFor dessert the crepe had just the right amount of sweetness but it could be too much for one person as we shared it.\n\nWhy am I giving it 3.5 stars and rounding it down to three?  Overall I think the restaurant is a bit over priced.  We ended up paying $100 a person and I think at a $100 a person, we can probably do fine dining.

We also had cocktails beforehand and ordered two sides with our meal: mushrooms and foi gras cauliflower. \n\nThe beef heart had a creaminess you wouldn't expect and was very pleasant. Not overly flavorful but very mild. If you didn't know it was beef heart, you'd never be able to tell. The pate was okay. It had more texture than I'd expect but flavor wise, it wasn't bad. The hot mess was delicious. The trotters were perfectly melt in your mouth. There were some bones left which I didn't mind at all. \n\nThe steak was to be cooked medium rare but we all agreed it came out more rare as some of the beef appeared to still be breathing. It wasn't well seasoned but it was still good. I don't feel like the foi gras or the foi gras butter or the au jus added much to the meat other than more richness which it really didn't need. I definitely rate this dish an okay and would not be ordering it again. \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was the pig's head. It smelled heavenly and it was cooked to perfection. The skin was super crispy and the meat was fall off the bone melt in your mouth. But it was not seasoned!!! At all!! I looked around the table for salt and pepper shaker but did not see any. I normally never add salt to my food at restaurants. Never. But I needed some desperately for this meal. The head came with two \"sauces\": a white sauce made with brains and a salsa verde made with drippings. I didn't try the white sauce but the salsa verde was a complete fail. It too had no seasoning, just a tanginess and oiliness which was totally not necessary considering the pig's head is pretty much all fat. \n\nI came into this meal knowing it was super rich and fatty but had it had flavor, I would not have been disappointed. I understand that the inside of the pig's head would have been hard to season but the skin was bland and the accompanying sauces were bland. It was bland fat on fat. \n\nThe mushrooms, on the other hand, were utterly divine! Simply delicious. I could have eaten a tub of that. The cauliflower was also delicious. \n\nWe were also very pleased with the cocktails. Best cocktails I've ever had and we had the special house made ones which usually aren't great but these were really really good, especially the Sweet November. It was sweet with a slight but pleasant bitterness. \n\nThe service was a bit on the slow side but it was a packed house. Our meal took 3 hours to finish. \n\nOverall, I'm not sure I'd go back. We've had the leg of beast at his other restaurant that closed, Incanto, and we loved it.

All I knew was this was a place to get great meat, great drinks and Cherrystones. Being from MA, I crave a little bit of home every now and then. Cockscomb is THE PLACE for lobster, clams, oysters, real meat on the grill, potatoes cooked just like Grammy used to...THEY USE REAL BUTTER! The entire thing, everything...its done with love. The ambiance, the music, the little tongue-in-cheek labels on the hand drier in the bathroom...the line of (mostly super smokin' hot men) cooking, burning themselves, sweating their balls off; literally...all in the name of great food for YOU, Me...and everyone that walks through the threshold of this glorious masterpiece.\n\nThere are 3 ways that captivate my heart and create loyalty; authenticity, the little details and great food. From the moment I opened the door to this amazing venue everyone on 'Team Cockscomb' was attentive, courteous and professional. My friend and I were seated at the bar, which is perfect for 2 single girls enjoying the open kitchen and everything else that is sensory overload for a good solid hour. I was welcomed by a wonderful man that let me know just as part of my conversation where the bathroom was located and where the 'hooks for your purse' are located. PHENOMENAL. It's not that I don't ever leave my home and people aren't nice to me; it's just awesome to experience great attention to the 'little things' when you aren't expecting it. The Yelp reviews lead me to this place, but don't do any justice when it comes to really, truly experiencing what it's like to dine here. \n\nOur Server knew my name, he knew it was a Birthday Dinner for me (which was not necessary, I have generous friends). I liked the guy so much I hugged him twice...once at the beginning of our meal and at the end when he told me how great we were. HE was the great one. I mean this guy Gabriel...he gave us a tour of the menu, explained the details, helped us feel at home and everything...was PERFECT. We tried the oysters, the cherry-stones (which were fabulous). The avocado enhancement was killer, I wish I knew exactly what that was because it's creamy and so yummy on the raw shellfish. Never have I had that, and I love it much more than a mignonette. We also asked for the beef heart tartare with roasted/pan fried/buttered potatoes (I want a bucket of them so I can be in a carb coma); whoa! you have to order this. The foie gras...best I've ever had. The bacon chop; it's enough for 4 people. The thing is HUGE and yummy, bacony...again, I'd never had this cut of meat and I hardly eat pork. You must get this. We also tried the chocolate...and yes...the cheese. Chocolate was decadent, rich, chocolatey...I much preferred the cheese. Bleu, honey, walnuts, jam...yum. We left with a doggie bag. I left with a new found love for a slice of my home in San Francisco. The entire evening I felt like I was in the company of an old friend and now it makes complete sense why.

The place is welcoming and the staff is excellent  with the waiters always attentive .  The interior of the restaurant is very simple and modern with a large bar on the first floor, another mini bar on the second and plenty of tables on both.

The grilled cheese and beef tartare was delicious but the foie gras is must if you're a fan. The combination of the three was definitely enough for 4 grown men. \nFor my entree I ordered the Bacon Chop and  shared with the guys on the Pig's Head. The Pig's Head was roasted near to perfection coming out hot from the wooden oven, watch you're fingers! The best part was definitely the cheek, melting like butter in your mouth. The skin wasn't too over cooked but just at the right crunchiness, mm-mm! The Bacon Chop, unfortunately, was a bit of  a disappointment as most of it was all fat but nonetheless the flavor was excellent and the dip that came out with it made you want more. I would suggest ordering more bread if its gets too porky or meaty for you. I will note though that my two other buddies came out with better chops as theirs were not as fatty. The dinner ended with some coffee and chocolate which was satisfying. \n\nOverall, the place was  good but what made the place stand out I think was the service and the portion size.

"], "author": "Ed U.", "review": "I had such high expectations of dining nirvana here but it was just not meant to be. I remember enjoying Incanto's head-to-tail dinner during Chris Cosentino's early days as its chef. I had not tried his latest venture before New Year's Eve when they were offering a special $110 four-course prix fixe dinner. Surely this was an optional choice. No, it wasn't. Since I made the reservation just two days in advance, I was left a message that there was a no-cancellation policy and that the prix fixe menu was mandatory. It struck me as rather restrictive, a reason to give me a case of pre-meat sweats. Would Cosentino's chops be worth it?\n\nNow understand that since I tried Incanto over a dozen years ago, Cosentino has become a celebrity chef as he became a constant presence on the Food Network and the ultimate anointment, a friend of Anthony Bourdain when he came to town looking for local eats. So when Jamie W. and I entered the restaurant, the former Zuppa, we saw his staff hovering around him like acolytes near the grill oven (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYZAG7). We were squeezed against a banquette right next to a trio of obnoxious twenty-something hipster wannabes bellowed their conversation like it was a decibel-challenged nightclub. Cocktails were needed immediately.\n\nJamie ordered the $11 Pisco Punch, a sweet Peruvian elixir with pineapple and nutmeg added to the mix (photo: http://bit.ly/1V27tcD). I went for the more clubby $12 Boothby, a blend of cranberry juice, Douglas Fir bourbon, sweet vermouth, bitters and sparkling wine (photo: http://bit.ly/1NguYZG). It was almost enough to distract me from the 'dude'-laden dialogue inches away from us. For the first course, Jamie tried the Parsnip & Smoked Haddock Chowder, a buttery-salty blend that was indeed velvety good and gone all too soon (photo: http://bit.ly/1n6TzLa). I went for what I presume to be a Cosentino specialty, the Foie Gras Torchon with Cranberries & Brioche (photo: http://bit.ly/1PbtRC1).\n\nExcept for the sweetness of the cranberries, I found the foie gras quite bland and not lusciously addictive. The second course brought salads. Jamie tried the Castel Franco & Ricotta Salata with Olives (photo: http://bit.ly/1PlTeL7). Castel Franco is a mild form of bitter radicchio that was overwhelmed by the amount of ricotta shavings on the plate. Mine was the other choice, the Butter Lettuce with Hazelnuts & Blood Orange (photo: http://bit.ly/1PlTcmq). It tasted like a standard steakhouse salad, inoffensive and tasty enough but nothing more really. The entrees came next, and we knew this was the make-or-break point of our evening since Cosentino, by all accounts, knows his meats.\n\nJamie ordered the Pork Belly, Clams & Buddha's Hand Citron Salsa (photo: http://bit.ly/1OsmYZr), an odd surf-&-turf combo that just didn't quite mesh despite the richness of the belly. The citrus flavor of the salsa added another idiosyncratic note that made Jamie's shoulders shrug in indifference. I went for the Ribeye with Bone Marrow & Spinach, and at last the steak delivered the goods in its tender preparation and meltably good texture (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZwtnFZ). Strangely I would have thought the bone marrow would mean toast wedges would be forthcoming upon which to spread the marrow. When I inquired about this, I received a puzzled look of acceptance and then about ten minutes of radio silence.\n\nWhen he did come with the grilled bread, I was done with the marrow and rather perturbed to find my request added to the bill later for $2. I just think for a restaurant at this exorbitant price point, a simple piece of bread could have been made complementary. Oh well. We moved to our final course, the dessert, and they were reasonably satisfying treats. Jamie had the Chocolate Cremeux & Golden Marshmallows, a mousse-like creation with its sole marshmallow given a bit of gold leaf (photo: http://bit.ly/1OB6GeK). I went with the Baked Apple with Gorgonzola & Honeycomb (photo: http://bit.ly/1PBxsDH). It was just half a small apple given the peasant treatment, but it was enough.\n\nNearly $300 later, we felt somewhat disappointed. It was less about the quality of the food which we didn't question but rather the indifferent manner which was pervasive throughout what should have been a more festive evening. The restaurant never did crowd up while we were there, and while we didn't expect Cosentino to stop by, it would have been a nice gesture. However, I could say the same about the staff overall since we didn't feel much warmth though it was clearly thrown at other diners around us. Alas, maybe we'll try the regular menu sometime as the burger looked like a good deal, but frankly we're in no hurry.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...considering Cosentino's reputation, marginally disappointing especially given the price point\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...doesn't look much different than Zuppa but that's fine\nSERVICE - 3 stars...didn't feel the love\nTOTAL - 3 stars...it should be more than the meat, right?", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["$105 for clams and pork belly?!?!

It was not possible to get through the mussels before they had chilled far too much.\n\nSpaghettini with tuna heart was decent, but really just one flavor note.

"], "author": "Crystal V.", "review": "With all the mixed reviews, I came here slightly hopeful--but with a somewhat of a low expectation. My dining mate and I had reservations but we came early and were able to be seated right away. We came around the beginning of dinner service so we were one of the few patrons there, however when we left, it was really crowded. The ambiance and the music was really good. Tables are really close together as most SF restaurants are so that was pretty understandable. Our server [Justin I think?] was really on point in describing the specials and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. Coming in with an idea of what we wanted-- we ordered barely any of those because of his great recommendations.\n\nOysters: For $3 each and a minimum of 1/2 a dozen, we stuck to the west coast oysters because  I generally like the smaller ones more. Nothing really stuck out about the oysters so I'd probably recommend skipping it. Its very easy to find fresh oysters in the city so you're probably better off saving room for other yummies.\n\nCrudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now. It was dressed similar to a ceviche style with nice lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos for a nice kick, and cucumbers to bring a crispness to it. A good dish, but again, not something I'd order again only because you can find this almost anywhere in the city.\n\nBeef heart tartare: YUM. Get this. I was pretty disappointed that ours didn't have a quail egg that I've seen boasted everywhere online/yelp. Ours came with a mustard-y sauce that didn't really add anything to the dish except make it easier to mix? This dish comes with two pieces of crostini/toast so my dining mate and I each got one. I went for the route where you slab a heavy layer of the beef heart tartare on and spread it then top it off with the arugula. The arugula was seasoned really salty by itself, but together with everything it was a beautiful dish. This is probably the best way to approach this dish. It comes with a helping of their seasoned potatoes which were also on point! The crispy skin was so nicely seasoned and not over powering. The potatoes were cooked just right so they still had a nice texture without being too starchy. \n\nLittle Gems: Needing some greens to go with our meal we opted for this salad with fried pig ears. I let my mate eat most of the pig ear because they weren't that special to me. I really enjoyed the salad and munched on that. The dressing was really nice and I don't know if its because I haven't allowed myself to have salad dressing in a long time, but I couldn't put my fork down! However towards the bottom of the salad it was pretty drenched making the salad lose its crisp. Maybe opt for the dressing on the side next time.\n\nGrilled Cheese with Truffles: My mate loves grilled cheese. He loves cheese, period. When looking at the menu the night before he said he was probably going to pass on this dish, but upon hearing about how it is there most popular dish, he changed his mind. I am so happy he did! It ended up being a really good dish and one of the top dishes of the night. Judging the pictures doesn't do this dish justice. The beautiful art of having the right consistency for a grilled cheese is really important. Cheese ratio-- not valid because the more the better. The toast complimented the cheese in its beautifully browned texture. The secret to this dish is not the truffles that are on top, but the honey that is used. With a taste in every bite, it was well rounded and delicious. Not overpoweringly sweet, but made a beautiful sweet symphony with the cheese. This portion of the meal was quiet due to the lovemaking of the sandwich and I. \n\nButchers Choice: Clam linguine with pork belly-- This dish was okay. I have been craving pasta for awhile so I thought this dish would help satisfy that craving. Sadly it did not. The texture of the linguine noodles were definitely different and was borderline udon noodles. The sauce was a lime citrus sauce that was really one note. I had to ask for some crush red peppers to give this baby a kick. The clams were okay and I didn't really find any pork belly. Pretty oily and would probably recommend skipping.\n\nButchers Choice: Hot mess-- YISSSSS. YES YES YES. Foie gras on top with a beef patty/croquette it seemed. My mate found the beef patty to have too much going on with a strange consistency, however when he spread the foie gras over it, turned his world upside down. Like, moment of silence, put your fork and knife down good delicious. This ritual happened after every single bite. I don't need to write much on this dish to convince you to get this because you know when theres silence at a dining table, theres magic.\n\nThough we left room for dessert, none of the options were really that impressive.

Then this place is for you! \n\nEarlier this week we sat down to one glass each  of Mumms Brut Champagne & Mionetto Prosecco while we perused the straightforward yet innovative menu. The prosecco was dry and crisp, while the Mumms balanced dry with a hint of butter. \n\nWe started with a cherry tomato salad ($12), served with fresh herbs and an interesting celery vinaigrette. Light, refreshing, and bursting with summer-garden flavor, we both agreed this dish was a winner. \n\nNext up came the charcuterie ($25 for a platter $45 for a board). Dark, sweet prosciutto, terrine, and njuda, which is a spicey spreadable salami. Curiously perfectly,  good bread had been brushed with olive oil and toasted.. in advance - so by time it got to us it was cold, slightly stale and a bit tough. \n\nDuring all this, we were seated at the bar overlooking the open kitchen, a front row seat to all the action. And what action! Sous chef plunking down a 1.5 pound lobster in a saute pan for the night's special? Check. A truly gigantic lamb shoulder, bone in, being prettied up with herbs before serving in it's own all clad roaster for service? Check. Pin bone steak, cooked rare, being sliced on a board for service? Check. After spying the lobster and seeing it plated for customers, we asked, 'why don't we know about this?' Turns out our server never mentioned the night's lobster on special, you can add it to supplement a steak or bacon chop, ($65) or have it on it's own. \n\nIn the end we opted for the bacon chop with lobster side with summer corn/king trumpet mushroom succatash. Then we had to choose, the double chop or single. Seeing the portions coming outta there I knew the double could feed 4 people not 2, so we opted for the single. Good call, 'cause that single chop was humongous. Lobster served pan roasted with spices and a dipping sauce that was both spicy but low in actual heat. \n\nMoving on from our bubbles we each had a glass or two of the Pertinace Nebbiolo ($12) which pared well with the rich and abundant fare. \n\nFinishing off, we ordered a peach tart, made with a butter crust and fresh whipped cream. Impressed, the host came over with two small glasses of brandy, on the house. \n\nI can whole heartedly recommend Cockscomb, somewhat pricey but you get what you pay for 10 times over.

I guess it is the greasiness...The skin was not that crispy, and it kinda stick to your teeth, for me I had to scrape off the fat attached to the skin, otherwise I don't think i can eat it. The other part is that you have to dig through all the fat under the skin in order to get to some lean meat and the digging part is kinda of... I don't know, it is just not for me. The dish came with some dipping sauce, it is pig's brain mixed with mayonnaise or they called it brainaise, not a big fan of it. There is also some sauce that dripped off the pig's head when roasting it, the chef mix it with some herbs which you can dip the skin or meat with it, again not a big fan of it.

I ordered the quail and loved how juicy and tender the meat was. I also loved the variety of mushrooms included in the dish as I'm a huge mushroom lover. My BF had the & Chips which he thought was decent. It was a long and narrow pork sausage with a skin casing that had a great snap to it. The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that). I tried my friend's Calf's Liver and it surprisingly didn't have that strong of an iron taste that most livers have and was tender. Very glad I tried it. My other friends said they enjoyed their dishes as well, especially the Bavette Steak as it was perfectly cooked.\n\nService was fantastic. Watchful eyes constantly had our waters filled and napkins folded when we walked away. Empty plates quickly cleared away. One of our friends had all his drinks and dishes picked by our waiter and he enjoyed his choices. Definitely an interesting experience for him.\n\nChef Cosentino was there prepping many of the meals that night and showing the other chefs what to do. It was thrilling to watch him work! Our server found out that I was a fan of Chef Cosentino and checked to see if he would be willing to take a picture. He was busy but our server wouldn't let me leave until I got a picture (he actually blocked the door!). I'm super shy so one of my friends was able to get Chef Cosentino's attention to get a picture. Awesome that he's willing to step away and take some time with the clientele.\n\nAmazing experience and food. Highly recommend!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-12-01"}, {"excerpts": ["A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\n"], "author": "Pierre L.", "review": "3.5 stars\n\nMy brother, a fan of chef Constentino and of eating odd things wanted to try this place and since I knew he was going to be free, we made the reservation to give it a try.  \n\nThe restaurant is located on 4th street, across the street from the Well Fargo.  Anyway walking in, the restaurant has a warm feeling.  Maybe it's the open kitchen on a cold winter night and the big animal head that hung over head (I think it was a moose) but has a cabin like kind of feeling.  Once we checked in we were seated right away in a communal like table where they used a few jars of buddha hands to divide up the two parties.  Since my brother and I have been eyeing the menu for a bit, we knew what we wanted to order and our parents are pretty easy so we ordered uni butter with crab bruschetta, greens and herbs, little gem salad, beef heart tartare, medium shellfish platter, pin bone steak, sole, quail, and 18 layer crepe (I think it was 18).\n\nThe bruschetta was good but it was not worth $19.  I didn't taste too much crab or uni and the bread was too chewy for our liking.  The beef heart tartare was a good dish both in portion and taste.  Again the bread that came with it (since they use the same bread) was a bit too tough and chewy.  One thing I didn't appreciate was when we asked for additional bread, they charged us for it which is a bit absurd (2 slices for $1).  The two salads I thought were actually pretty tasty as it wasn't over dressed and decent in portion.  The medium shellfish platter at $48 was enough for us.  A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\nFor the entrees, I thought the quail was ridiculously over priced.  Two small pieces of meat for $35 was a rip off.  It was good but not worth $35 good.  We had a quail a few weeks ago at another place, while I don't remember the price (it was close, may be a bit less) there was definitely more meat to it.  The sold was a little bit more filling but could have used more seasoning I thought.  The main attraction, the pin bone steak was actually very generous in size.  There was more than enough for all of us but my brother and I both agreed it needed more flavor.  The beef jus that came with it was average and the bone marrow sauce was pure oil.  While I understand that eating meat on the medium rare side is generally how it's supposed to be, I would have appreciated if the waiter asked if that is okay.  \n\nOverall service was above average as they checked in on us often, made sure we had enough water.  One minor complaint is that if you have a special or something that says market price, let us know the price and don't wait for us to ask.  It's not a big deal but just something i appreciate.\n\nFor dessert the crepe had just the right amount of sweetness but it could be too much for one person as we shared it.\n\nWhy am I giving it 3.5 stars and rounding it down to three?  Overall I think the restaurant is a bit over priced.  We ended up paying $100 a person and I think at a $100 a person, we can probably do fine dining.  I did like this place better than Incanto (chef's last place) and I wouldn't mind giving it another try.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Then we had oysters, clams and crab appetizer followed with the special of the day lamb hearts.

Prior to this evening; I had NO idea that he was a Celebrity Chef (I knew he was a SF Chef, but really NO clue about the rest), no idea that he grew up in Rhode Island and no idea that he's an entrepreneur with a sausage outpost at San Francisco's Ferry Building. I didn't know about Iron Chef; i simply didn't know about the brainstorm behind the experience I had tonight that I am about to share with all of you. All I knew was this was a place to get great meat, great drinks and Cherrystones. Being from MA, I crave a little bit of home every now and then. Cockscomb is THE PLACE for lobster, clams, oysters, real meat on the grill, potatoes cooked just like Grammy used to...THEY USE REAL BUTTER! The entire thing, everything...its done with love. The ambiance, the music, the little tongue-in-cheek labels on the hand drier in the bathroom...the line of (mostly super smokin' hot men) cooking, burning themselves, sweating their balls off; literally...all in the name of great food for YOU, Me...and everyone that walks through the threshold of this glorious masterpiece.\n\nThere are 3 ways that captivate my heart and create loyalty; authenticity, the little details and great food. From the moment I opened the door to this amazing venue everyone on 'Team Cockscomb' was attentive, courteous and professional. My friend and I were seated at the bar, which is perfect for 2 single girls enjoying the open kitchen and everything else that is sensory overload for a good solid hour. I was welcomed by a wonderful man that let me know just as part of my conversation where the bathroom was located and where the 'hooks for your purse' are located. PHENOMENAL. It's not that I don't ever leave my home and people aren't nice to me; it's just awesome to experience great attention to the 'little things' when you aren't expecting it. The Yelp reviews lead me to this place, but don't do any justice when it comes to really, truly experiencing what it's like to dine here. \n\nOur Server knew my name, he knew it was a Birthday Dinner for me (which was not necessary, I have generous friends). I liked the guy so much I hugged him twice...once at the beginning of our meal and at the end when he told me how great we were. HE was the great one. I mean this guy Gabriel...he gave us a tour of the menu, explained the details, helped us feel at home and everything...was PERFECT. We tried the oysters, the cherry-stones (which were fabulous). The avocado enhancement was killer, I wish I knew exactly what that was because it's creamy and so yummy on the raw shellfish. Never have I had that, and I love it much more than a mignonette. We also asked for the beef heart tartare with roasted/pan fried/buttered potatoes (I want a bucket of them so I can be in a carb coma); whoa! you have to order this. The foie gras...best I've ever had. The bacon chop; it's enough for 4 people. The thing is HUGE and yummy, bacony...again, I'd never had this cut of meat and I hardly eat pork. You must get this. We also tried the chocolate...and yes...the cheese. Chocolate was decadent, rich, chocolatey...I much preferred the cheese. Bleu, honey, walnuts, jam...yum. We left with a doggie bag. I left with a new found love for a slice of my home in San Francisco. The entire evening I felt like I was in the company of an old friend and now it makes complete sense why.

I would also recommend to course the meat dishes out so that you could try each dish when they are at their best (hot).\n\nMy favorites:\nWood oven roasted pig's head - don't miss the crispy pig ear that one could tear off and the skin was some of the best part of the dish.\n\nRoasted butternut squash - well flavored and just the right texture.

People who complain about the head being too rich and knocking off points for it is being unreasonable. I feel like this dish isn't meant for just 2 people to eat it.. and it isn't a MAIN dish.  Because it's so rich, it should be shared and even having a little portion of it is enough.  My bf and I decided to get it because we just had to. You can't find anything else like that in the city. \n\nOld Fashion 5/5: The bartender made this drink perfect. \n\nOverall, we had a great anniversary dinner here. We were seated by the bar in front of the oven, which was fine because we got to see them cook and they were kind to answer any questions.

I didn't comprehend the name until he broke it out into syllables: Cock as in chicken and comb as in a hair comb.  After that, it was easy for me to Yelp it and grab the address.  Cockscomb is located on the corner of 4th and Freelon but the more familiar streets would be either Brannan or Bryant.  Street parking is your friend and usually there's a good amount of metered parking on Bryant Street.  There's two floors available and I personally think the top floor is slightly quieter than the bottom floor.\n\nThe waiter is friendly but extremely animated when it's his turn to describe in detail the various offering of today's menu.  I'd say he has a mutant power of memorization because he recited all of the little bells and whistles of each and every item.  We had to ask about a few items due to allergies and the waiter alleviated our concerns with confidence.  Anyhoo, here's the feast we ordered:\n\n- Pig Head = Half of a pigs head cooked for 45 min in their secret oven.\n- Bone Marrow = Bone marrow with bread\n- Bacon Chop = Pork chops\n- Grilled Cheese = sandwich\n- Hot Mess = Foie Gras special\n- Duck Fat Squash = Squash drizzled with fat from a fowl\n- Little Gems = Salad.  The only veggies we ordered.\n- Apricot dessert\n\nThe pig head is the signature thing you want to set your eyes on.  It's half of a pig's head braised for hours? (or days?) and cooked in the oven for 45 min before served to you.  The meat is extremely soft and tender.  The ears are crispy and chewy.  You may want to save them ears for your dog at home because it's a great treat.  This item serves 2-3.  The other notable items I want to point out are the Hot Mess and Duck Fat Squash.  The Hot Mess isn't always on the menu (it's a special) but it's basically Foie Gras.  If you're a fan of this delicacy, you don't want to miss out on it.

"], "author": "Crystal V.", "review": "With all the mixed reviews, I came here slightly hopeful--but with a somewhat of a low expectation. My dining mate and I had reservations but we came early and were able to be seated right away. We came around the beginning of dinner service so we were one of the few patrons there, however when we left, it was really crowded. The ambiance and the music was really good. Tables are really close together as most SF restaurants are so that was pretty understandable. Our server [Justin I think?] was really on point in describing the specials and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. Coming in with an idea of what we wanted-- we ordered barely any of those because of his great recommendations.\n\nOysters: For $3 each and a minimum of 1/2 a dozen, we stuck to the west coast oysters because  I generally like the smaller ones more. Nothing really stuck out about the oysters so I'd probably recommend skipping it. Its very easy to find fresh oysters in the city so you're probably better off saving room for other yummies.\n\nCrudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now. It was dressed similar to a ceviche style with nice lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos for a nice kick, and cucumbers to bring a crispness to it. A good dish, but again, not something I'd order again only because you can find this almost anywhere in the city.\n\nBeef heart tartare: YUM. Get this. I was pretty disappointed that ours didn't have a quail egg that I've seen boasted everywhere online/yelp. Ours came with a mustard-y sauce that didn't really add anything to the dish except make it easier to mix? This dish comes with two pieces of crostini/toast so my dining mate and I each got one. I went for the route where you slab a heavy layer of the beef heart tartare on and spread it then top it off with the arugula. The arugula was seasoned really salty by itself, but together with everything it was a beautiful dish. This is probably the best way to approach this dish. It comes with a helping of their seasoned potatoes which were also on point! The crispy skin was so nicely seasoned and not over powering. The potatoes were cooked just right so they still had a nice texture without being too starchy. \n\nLittle Gems: Needing some greens to go with our meal we opted for this salad with fried pig ears. I let my mate eat most of the pig ear because they weren't that special to me. I really enjoyed the salad and munched on that. The dressing was really nice and I don't know if its because I haven't allowed myself to have salad dressing in a long time, but I couldn't put my fork down! However towards the bottom of the salad it was pretty drenched making the salad lose its crisp. Maybe opt for the dressing on the side next time.\n\nGrilled Cheese with Truffles: My mate loves grilled cheese. He loves cheese, period. When looking at the menu the night before he said he was probably going to pass on this dish, but upon hearing about how it is there most popular dish, he changed his mind. I am so happy he did! It ended up being a really good dish and one of the top dishes of the night. Judging the pictures doesn't do this dish justice. The beautiful art of having the right consistency for a grilled cheese is really important. Cheese ratio-- not valid because the more the better. The toast complimented the cheese in its beautifully browned texture. The secret to this dish is not the truffles that are on top, but the honey that is used. With a taste in every bite, it was well rounded and delicious. Not overpoweringly sweet, but made a beautiful sweet symphony with the cheese. This portion of the meal was quiet due to the lovemaking of the sandwich and I. \n\nButchers Choice: Clam linguine with pork belly-- This dish was okay. I have been craving pasta for awhile so I thought this dish would help satisfy that craving. Sadly it did not. The texture of the linguine noodles were definitely different and was borderline udon noodles. The sauce was a lime citrus sauce that was really one note. I had to ask for some crush red peppers to give this baby a kick. The clams were okay and I didn't really find any pork belly. Pretty oily and would probably recommend skipping.\n\nButchers Choice: Hot mess-- YISSSSS. YES YES YES. Foie gras on top with a beef patty/croquette it seemed. My mate found the beef patty to have too much going on with a strange consistency, however when he spread the foie gras over it, turned his world upside down. Like, moment of silence, put your fork and knife down good delicious. This ritual happened after every single bite. I don't need to write much on this dish to convince you to get this because you know when theres silence at a dining table, theres magic.\n\nThough we left room for dessert, none of the options were really that impressive.

My BF had the & Chips which he thought was decent. It was a long and narrow pork sausage with a skin casing that had a great snap to it. The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that).

", "It was a lovely combo of salty and crunchy and herbaciousness. "], "author": "DeathandFood H.", "review": "We have a contender for best new restaurant of 2014/2015.  Some of the food harkens back to San Franciscan classics, lots of meats, a nice fire pit that is put to good use, lots of things that you will see at other restaurant but damn does Cosentino know that what really matter is flavour!\n\nTL:RL: pricy but totally worth it meatfest with good seafood too. Not the best place for a vegetarian but they would be happy here. Very noisy space that's a bit too hipster/early 90's skater for my personal tastes but in keeping with current trends. \n\nLonger review: We went during the soft opening and normally I wouldn't review it completely as most places are getting the kinks out but Cockscomb was already a smooth well oiled machine that did not disappoint in terms of service or food.\n\nDishes we tried:\n\n1. Eggs, Eggs, Eggs: chicken eggs, duck egg and roe-probably our least favourite dish. Surprisingly it was served cold, the herb dressing was delicious and tied it together into a nice cold egg salad. The eggs sadly were not all soft poached which they were suppose to be but they replaced our harder ones with some softer one.\n\n2. Tombo Crudo: chunks of tombo with a very little coating of chili and acid served with wontons wrappers. very nice quality fish, wish the wontons had been warm.\n\n3. Little Gems with green goddess and crispy pig ear- this was a classic salad with green goddess dressing and tiny crispy bit of pig ears. It was a lovely combo of salty and crunchy and herbaciousness. I would have loved for the pig ear to be freshly cooked.\n\n4 We started the meal with 1/2 dozen  oysters, they had a selection of four including ones from Virginia, Washington and Oregon. The selection was good and they were served with a choice of three sauces, a mustard oil, a traditional mignonette and an avocado cream.\n\n5. Grilled cheese with brioche bread and black truffles. I am not a \"comfort food\" person or someone who loves it when a chef \"elevates\" some thing simple and then charges 20 bucks for it. However this is freaking delicious. Sweet light brioche, pungent cheese, a thin layer of honey and a healthy portion of black truffles on top. I would happily come back just for that even if it was over 10 bucks.\n\n6. I had butcher's choice which was calf's liver and onions. Just like mom made it if mom was able to make a demi-glace and had an open fire to cook it. There were few tough bits but for the most part it was perfect cooked with a velvety texture and the onions and jus were great additions.\n\n7.  We finished with a Mille cr\u00eapes which instead of pastry cream between layers had a been soak in syrup of some kind. It wasn't overly sweet which I appreciated and the French Spouse declared it pretty good for a non-French person.\n\n8. They serve espresso but don't have cream only milk.\n\nService: I made a reservation so I was a bit surprised when I got there to be seated at the chef's bar. I expect to be given a choice of a table when I have a reservation. The hostess said there were no two-tops downstairs and the only one free were upstairs in the back dining room. We choose to stay at the low counter that was directly in front of the grills and enjoyed it there but when we left there were still two two-tops that had been free the entire time we were eating. Other than that the service was extremely good with a very friendly knowledgeable server who was responsive about things that didn't work for us and the rest of the serving staff including busers were on point.\n\nAtmosphere: While the restaurant is listed as being on 4th street, it's on a corner with the entrance is on the side street. The decor is pure hipster even if the chef would hate that term. Taxidermy on all the walls and Edison bulb as well as not a soft surface in sight means this is a loud place and the lighting is poor for reading the menu. It's ok for ASL but could be hard for the hard of hearing. There are two floors but there is an elevator and the bathrooms both unisex are on the ground floor. Most tables are wheelchair accessible as are three seats at the chef's counter.  There is one communal table downstairs. Upstairs there is small lounge area with perhaps the best seats if you like to hold court with a curved dining bar overlooking the lower space, there was also a bar and then a back dining room which looked great for a private event or dinner. The spouse kept telling me what late 90's music we were listening too and it had that feeling of a middle class skatepunk all grown up with the firewood stand made with BMX folks.\n\nWith entrees in the 30's, starters in teens, expect to pay at least 45-55 a person without drinks. They have some amazing shared meats like a whole pigs head that the folks next to us got that looked and smelled amazing and that I will try to find a carnivore friend to share it with in the future.\n\nAll in all Chris Cosentino has a really nice menu and staff happening here and there is no reason why it shouldn't be quite successful.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-11-29"}, {"excerpts": ["I wholeheartedly recommend everything I managed to eat, which I realize now is going to make an incredibly long list:\n\nGrilled Cheese w/Truffles and Honey, Oysters, Duck Liver Terrine, Eggs Eggs Eggs, Little Gems Salad, Bacon Chop, 'Ham' Burger, and at least two other unbelievable dishes that I can't seem to place the names of but hope to meet again. \n\n"], "author": "A Z.", "review": "Tastes like MORE!\n\nHad the pleasure of being treated to an amazing meal at the new Cockscomb for my birthday.

Both are expensive habits, so I try to ration my visits accordingly (but probably unsuccessfully).  So far, I've limited myself to special occasions to dine here (my wedding anniversary, the wedding anniversary for some friends, and to entertain out-of-town visitors).  \n\nFirst tip:  come hungry.  The portions are fairly big, but you want to try a bunch of different items.\nSecond tip:  make a dinner reservation, even during the week.  This place always seems full, even on random Wednesday nights.  Chef Cosentino is a big name in the culinary world, so plenty of tourists flock here.\nThird tip:  if you are looking for the \"Impossible burger,\" it's only served at lunch.  No dinner options for this popular (and curious) meal.\nFourth tip:  even though meat is the big draw here, leave some room for dessert.  After all the savory flavors, some sweet treats at the end of the meal are always welcome.\n\nSince the menu always changes, I will just highlight some of my most memorable dishes:\n\nPin bone steak:  one of the few non-rotating choices, it's listed under the \"Shared Suppers\" section.  And they are not kidding.  I've ordered this for parties of 4, and all 4 people need to be pretty hungry (and love beef) to finish this.  Served with a bone marrow dip, the steak is luxurious and food-coma inducing.  \n\nWood oven roasted pigs head:  always a head turner, this \"Shared Supper\" (also a menu staple) is not for the faint of heart.  The head of any animal is underrated by diners, with some of the most tender and flavorful meat inside the cheeks and neck of a beast.  The pig's head is no exception.  The skin was crispy from the oven-roasting and the meat among the most tasty I've ever had.  In addition, the dish is served with 2 different sauces on the side, both made from the pork \"drippings.\"  My wife & I shared this at one meal, but we had a difficult time sleeping that night, since that meal was so heavy.  You have been warned.\n\nCountry pate:  Sometimes this is offered by itself, other times as part of the charcuterie platter.  But it's the best pate I've ever had.  The meat is not so finely ground, but chunky instead, served with some very crusty bread.  I've been tempted to pick up an order of the pate to go and walk into AT&T Park with it, eating this while watching a Giants game (which would be SO San Francisco of me!).\n\nButcher's Choice:  this is usually one of the daily specials.  My favorite so far has been an order of cow udder, served with escargot.  I've never seen cow udder on any menu, but I plan to get an order every time it's available.

Acquired taste.\n\nDuck Fat Cauliflower-red fresno, garlic, caper & mint- I didn't like it. Kind of soggy and was bland.\n\nBroccoli Rabe-garlic, lemon, chili & breadcrumbs-Reminded me of Chinese Broccoli and kind of bitter. Not a big fan.\n\nBone Marrow-hay smoked fried oysters, watercress & horseradish. The star of the show! I was very pleased and I'm a sucker for it.\n\nToasted Oats- maitake mushrooms, kale, poached egg & button mushrooms-I guess I'm a snob because I did not like this dish at all. I believe toasted oats is a breakfast item and the mixture did not like my palate.\n\nBacon Chop-apples, brussellskraut & mustard-HUGE!! but where was the bacon? lol the pork chop itself was cooked to perfection, tender and grilled on point. My only complaint was the large amount of fat on it. \n\nI would like to give Cockscomb another chance and try other items on the menu, but for now 3.5 stars.

Lol!)\n\nMy friends and I have been waiting for a chance to go to Chris Cosentino's new restaurant Cockscomb. Who doesn't want to eat a whole pig's head?! Thank you Peter L for arranging the reservation and making this happen! We had a party of 5 people.\n\nDrinks:\n*Big trouble in little China ($11): dark rum, coconut milk, pineapple, mint\n*Boothby ($11): pomegranate infused bourbon, sweet vermouth, bitters & sparkling wine\n*Milk punch ($11): pisco based punch with a combination of rum, citrus & exotic spices\n*Bullitt ($15): old potrero rye, cynar, grapefruit bitters\n*The martini ($11): old Tom gin, noilly prat dry vermouth served up, finished with lemon disk\n*Cascina roccalini: barbaresco, italy, 2010 ($68)\n\nI had been nursing a hangover all day, so I really only had my drink which was the Bullitt. Dark and boozy and not too sweet. I had a sip of the red which paired nicely with our dinner selections.\n\n*Bruschetta ($19): uni and lardo\nThis was my favorite appetizer. The bread was rustic and crusty. And the uni with lardo was delicious!\n\n*'Eggs, eggs, eggs': salmon roe and tarragon aioli ($14)\nMy gf really liked this. She loves eggs. This was great on their toast. The egg yolk was like liquid gold! So rich and creamy.\n\n*Pickled sardines: giardiniera ($13)\nThis provided a salty contrast to our other dishes. I loved the veggies that came with this.\n\n*Duck liver terrine: pickled fruit and grilled bread ($14)\nDeliciously creamy! I love liver pate and this didn't disappoint.\n\n*Grilled cheese: truffle and honey ($16)\nI love truffle so I would have really enjoyed this without the honey. I only had a couple of bites since I'm not a huge fan of sweet and savory.\n\n*Wood oven roasted pig's head: endives, capers, parsley & lemon ($50)\nThis is a thing of beauty to look at! If you can't stand looking at fat, I'd say stay away from this. The dish is definitely like digging for moist delicious pieces of meat through layers and layers of fat! Due to richness of the meat, I could only eat so much of this. The crispy skin however, I kept picking at. It was like delicious pig chips! Yum!\n\n*Bone marrow mixed grill: watercress and horseradish ($20)\nThis was actually a huge disappointment. The big bone marrow barely had an marrow in it. And it was quite difficult to dig marrow out of the smaller bones. We basically gave up.\n\n*Bavette steak: roasted carrots, onions, thyme and kombu butter ($33)\nYum! Tender and cooked perfectly! And the serving was enough for each of us to have a slice. Definitely my favorite main.\n\n*Broccoli rabe: garlic, lemon, chili and breadcrumbs ($6)\nI love having veggies with dinner, so this was a great side! We needed some contrast to all the richness.\n\nWith all these dishes, we were stuffed! There was a party next to us who had ordered a delicious looking seafood tower. I may have to come back just for that. It looked amazing!\n\nI saw Chris Cosentino upstairs saying hi to a table and downstairs while they were closing up. But I was too shy to ask for a picture.

I cannot remember ever eating so much rich food in one sitting. It has original food, a comfortable yet upscale ambiance and it pays attention to detail. Coming with a larger group will make it a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe item everyone wants is the pigs head. Pretty amazing to see this on a menu and even more surprising to see it in person. People walking by stop and ask to take pictures of it. It is huge and incredibly fatty, we had most of ours bagged up to take home. The waiter said it goes great with eggs. The crispy ears that it comes with are amazing. I wouldn't recommend ordering this as everyone's main course, it is just too fatty, but a very fun and unique dish.\n\nBeef heart tartare was another original dish that I have never seen anyone else do. The waiter describes it as having fuller flavor, like steak tartare would have been 60 years ago before they started having hormones pumped into the meat. It was a spot on description. Full of flavor. This was my favorite dish of the night.\n\nThe duck liver terrine was incredibly strong. If you are a big liver fan you will enjoy it, but if you are at all on the fence about such things it might be a pass. It comes with some jammed fruit and thick toast to help balance it, but the ratio leaves not enough bread. Had to ask for additional slices to finish it.\n\nThe pin bone steak was huge and would have fed four people as a main entree. The cool factor in this dish was it being served with a chefs knife; very empowering. It was good, but not remarkable as far as on the bone large cuts go. It comes with some toppings which were tasty additions. The steak knives were very sleek Shun knives, which made the meat like a cloud to cut through, really excellent cutlery. \n\nThe desert was phenomenal, and was only $7. An olive oil cake with a lemon cream and br\u00fbl\u00e9ed blood oranges, which were fantastic.\n\nWine by the glass was a bit lacking in variety, only about four choices for red. There were some good reasonably priced options tho. The wine was served in Spiegelau glasses.\n\nAs with most new restaurants, the price of eating there soon after opening is dealing with some hiccups. None of them major, but for the price of the restaurant they added up. We arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table. With the larger items on the menu it is unclear how much to order and I feel our waiter made the pigs head seem like less food than it was. I've never left a restaurant with so many leftovers.  Ordered a coffee after dinner and it hadn't come by the end of desert, so we just canceled it. Also we ordered an additional side of bread to finish the terrine and they charged $1 for it. It seems petty to see a one dollar line item for bread on a $300 bill. On the plus side, there was a miscommunication on what we ordered for one of the dishes and they took it off the bill, nice touch.\n\nOverall would recommend this place out of the sheer uniqueness of the food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with the Beef Heart Tartar, Uni Bruschetta, and the Duck Liver Terrine was one of the best I've had.

The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that).

You enter the restaurant from a not-so-flashy entrance to a beautifully decorated interior. Open kitchen, ambient lighting, eclectic decorations, it makes for a perfect SF dinner.\n\nWe called for a reservation and found out that for parties of 5 or more, they require putting down credit card information. We ended up being just 4 people and arrived 45 minutes earlier than planned. They were very accommodating and were able to seat us right away. \n\nThe service was friendly and very quick. The server was knowledgeable in the menu and gave great recommendations. The most impressive was that we were not looking to spend a lot of money and she didn't seem annoyed by this. She gave fantastic recommendations for saving money and still getting enough food to fill us up. \n\nSome of our selections were grilled cheese with duck egg, HAM burger, and Zampini. The food came out faster than expected and was delicious. I thought the grilled cheese was good but not great. But it definitely changed my life for the better because who would've thought to put HONEY on grilled cheese??? I wasn't that big of a fan of the duck egg on top, maybe I just don't like the consistency of duck egg. The HAMburger was delicious, probably my favorite of the night. The patty (made of ham, obvi) was juicy and tender. The dish came with large heaps of roasted potatoes. This all came out to be just $15, well worth it. Lastly, the Zampini. I really struggled understanding what this dish was at first until it came out and it was a ring of sausage. The sausage itself was good, but nothing too special. However, the corn and tomato succotash of sorts was the highlight of the plate for me. Not sure what seasoning they used, but it was a weird but delicious flavor. \n\nI took off one star because for a restaurant with the price that they charge, the menu items weren't that appealing to me. I chose the grilled cheese appetizer as an entree because nothing else sounded THAT amazing to me. To each their own though, I think the food was still fantastic I would give the other items a try next time.

Talking to Chris who came to our table after dinner and talk about the origins of food and his desire to have Cockscomb be known as a SF Brasserie was great. It's not often you can have that type of conversation. He spent a good 10 minutes with us chatting and gave me some great restaurants to check out in my upcoming trip to Washington D.C. (You'll have to wait for my reviews to see what his favorites are there :-). \n\nChris is a fantastic and down to earth person who loves food and sharing the experience. Thanks Chris for an amazing evening.\n\nREVIEW\nWe walked in and waited at the bar ordering a great Amaretto Sour as a starter drink and had a great conversation with the bartender on gins and small distilleries (they serve some great locals such as St. George's from Alameda along with some other great local distilleries.\n\nAPPETIZER\nFor starters we ordered the special for tonight called \"Hot Mess\". This was a plate of seared fois gras and pig trotters set in a wonderful sweet berry sauce that offset the richness of the dish.\n5 stars\n\nNext was the Grilled Cheese with honey drizzle and fried duck egg with a wonderfully creamy yolk that I popped and poured over the dish. I then flipped over the white to cover the top and cut it up in bite size pieces for the table. The cheeses were oozing out of the bread like a river of cheese working it's way around the bread on the plate. This is a do not miss dish if you like GC and want it with a twist.\n5 stars\n\nMAIN COURSE 1\nDuck, served with the most amazing grilled squash. This is not the typical green squash squash bit rather various types with mottled skin that tasted very much like sweet potato and regular potatos perfectly seasoned with just enough salt to mix with the sweetness of the squash. I was surprised how good squash can be if care is given to think about cooking it differently such as tonight.\n\nThe duck skin was crispy and the amount of duck meat was surprisingly large. This feeds 4 easily.  The duck meat was tender, we'll seasoned and set on top of some duck au ju.\n5 stars\n\nMAIN COURSE 2\nPin Steak serverd with bone marrow sauce! Oh yes you heard it right. This is a massive sirloin with bone, cooked and served from rare to med rare so everyone was happy. The meat itself was fantastically seasoned and could stand on its own.  However, after you pour the bone marrow sauce on it and take a bite you want to yell \" THIS IS AWESOME!\".\n\nI have eaten tons of steak and a lot of bone marrow in my travels but bone marrow sauce poured on your steak? Yes it is WOW.\n5 Stars\n\nSIDE DISH\nDirty Potatoes which are slightly fried potato whole and pieces lightly salted with creme fraiche and sweet hot red peppers. The peppers add some nice flavor and slight heat to the potatoes to really give you something different than your usual potato dish. Crispy outside and a nice soft center made this a great starch to go along with the meat.\n5 stars\n\nDESSERT 1\nChocolate flourless cake with pistachio crumbles and chocolate ganache. A very rich and semi sweet cake that was excellent. Smooth as silk, and topped with a scoop of caramel ice cream, this dish was done in 30 seconds by the 4 of us.\n5 Stars\n\nDESSERT 2\nLemon olive oil cake with fresh citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges). This was very refreshing and light.  The olive oil cake was perfect, great smooth texture, and extremely moist. The citrus juices soaked into the cake for a mouthful of flavors. If you want to go light in dessert this is a great option.\n5 Stars\n\nCappuccino and Americanos were great. A nice layer of very thick and creamy foam topped our cappuccinos and the espresso was excellent.\n\nTIP: We came for the pigs head but they were out. Chris told me you have to come early (we had 8:30pm reservations) or call ahead and let them know you want one as it varies as to how many heads he can get daily. \n\nI will definitely be back to order the bacon chop and pigs head to finish off the large main meat dishes on the menu.\n\nAn amazing evening and incredibly well prepared food.

We ordered 5 items and it was the item I was least excited about ended up tasting the best. The bread and cheese ratio was the perfect balance. There was an extra flair of flavor added to the cheese that just made it that much more savory but what really impressed me and made the grilled cheese unique was the added honey! The marriage of this added ingredient was well thought out touch that made a grilled cheese become the life of the party.\n\nI was not impressed with the Bacon Chop. The fat ratio of the chop was extremely unbalanced and the texture of the Chop was not even a texture you can chew. Also not impressed with the Dirty Potatoes that everyone raves about. The spice was a bit strong and the the size of the potatoes was not cut to a proportionate size to the flavor. I was confused with every bite! The Pig Ears were ok.

Heck, we're eating at the winner of Top Chef Master's restaurant, and so we're expecting to have a unique and tasty experience, and we do.\n\nIf you were in San Francisco on March 12, 2016 you know that it rained gently for a good part of the day, and then hard for a good part of the day.  As we are tourists, we had planned for a long walk that included parking near Cockscomb, a walk to the Ferry Building for the farmer's market, a walk down to Pier 33 where we can get on our Alcatraz 'cruise' to the island, and then we tour the island and then our day concluded with the walk back to Cockscomb.  Sounded like a great plan, and it was, and it's all being shared here so that you appreciate that we showed up at the restaurant early and soaked... They opened about five minutes early so we got some reprieve from the weather.\n\nWe had requested the opportunity to watch the chef's work, and so we were able to sit right at the kitchen and chat with the chefs as they were working. This was great, and I'd highly recommend this to you if you're interested in food, asking questions and chatting, and at this restaurant you'd better be prepared.  The chefs are not shy.  We spoke with probably five or six different people working in the kitchen and we found them all personable and fun.  I'm sure it's the culture that's been created at the restaurant, and, for me, it's a great culture.  The Top Chef was not in the night we were there, and yet his crew carried on.\n\nOn to the food, and know that the menu is very tempting.  My wife and I ended up selecting the 'bacon chop', as we planned to share it. We also ordered sides of cauliflower braised in duck fat, gnocchi, and grilled broccoli.  The 'bacon chop' is huge.  Picture, if you will, a New York steak that's thicker and longer than the biggest New York steak you've ever had.  My wife at a third, and I was forced to eat the other two-thirds, but I was able to suffer through it.\n\nTo summarize, we enjoyed everything, and Cockscomb is now on the short list of places we'd return.  I was surprised in San Francisco though, as we mentioned to people that we were going here for dinner, and they didn't seem to even know it exists.  As far as I'm concerned, that's good for us.  On the Saturday night that I was there, it was crowded and I'm sure that's good for the restaurant.

A nice atmosphere. While I didn't spend any time at the bar, it was very cute looking. We were seated immediately upon arrival, given a choice of table or chef's counter. We were seated at a communal table, which did disappoint me at first since I had made reservations, I was expecting a private table. However, we shared the long table with two couples over the span of three hours, and it didn't bother us at all in the end.\n\nOur waiter was the best waiter I think I've ever had at any place I have ever eaten. His name is Sam, and I trusted him, wholeheartedly. He was very attentive, and knew the menu like the back of his own hand. He didn't even write down what we ordered, he just remembered, and we got everything we wanted in a very timely manner. The wine here is pricey (expect to pay about $100 for a bottle), but the bottle I chose was very good. It was the Arietta Bordeaux, 2014, and took about 20-30 minutes to fully open up, however Sam offered us a decanter (something that no other restaurant has ever offered). This wine paired well with everything we ordered.\n\nWe started with the grilled cheese. This was good. Could I make it at home? No. It uses incredibly expensive ingredients. Could I mimic it? Hmmm maybe. For our mains, we ordered the bacon chop, the sweet potato, as well as the spaghetti squash (a side dish). At first I found the bacon chop to be quite salty, but then I ate it with the tangerine slices served with it, and voila! Perfectly balanced. The sweet potato dish was delicious, no extra comments needed here. The spaghetti squash had a spicy kick that I wasn't expecting, but I welcomed it.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the first thing that we heard (Sam recited the whole menu, and we never even saw a physical dessert menu). All of it sounded amazing, but we got a chocolate flourless (? I'm guessing because I can't remember since I didn't read it), cake with pistachios and a small scoop of coffee ice cream on top. So good. Order this.\n\nOverall, we were never rushed and we both felt very at ease. We had a lovely dinner, and would like to thank the staff and the owner for giving us a pleasant and romantic Valentine's Day dinner. I'd also like to add that I was sending photos of the food to my dad, who I found out had actually been here before with a group.

Wines by the bottle were $40-$120.\n*Classic Gin & Tonic ($12): http://bit.ly/1yuRvh6\n*Chef's Gin Jam ($11): http://bit.ly/1yaFdwL\n*Big Trouble in Little China ($11): http://bit.ly/12jWzZM\n\nMy fav was the Chef's Gin with housemade strawberry jam; nicely sweet, tart, and refreshing.\n\nA P P E T I Z E R S \n*Little Gem Salad w/ green goddess dressing & crispy pig ears ($11): http://bit.ly/1tDTmuH\n*Grilled Cheese w/ shaved black truffles & honey ($16): http://bit.ly/1vJxRNh\n*Eggsx3 w/ trout roe & tarragon aioli ($14): http://bit.ly/12eQVsN; yolk porn: http://bit.ly/1wcejnf\n*Beef Heart Tartare w/ grilled bread & fries ($16): http://bit.ly/1FHB2Y8\n*Bone Marrow Mixed Grill w/ watercress & horseradish ($20): http://bit.ly/1FJ35IC\n*Uni Bruschetta w/ Iberico lardo ($18): http://bit.ly/1yBGnA3\n\nAll the apps we ordered were excellent. The little gem salad which was nicely dressed and had a great porky crunch from the pig ears (I wish there was more of it though). The grilled cheese could have had more cheese but the shaved black truffles added a great luxurious earthiness. If you like oozy yolk porn, the eggx3 is a must order!\n\nThe beef heart tartare was one hearty dish (great for sharing) especially with the deliciously crispy fried potatoes. The trio of bone marrow was slightly disappointing as we found it hard to dig out marrow from the other non-beef bones. The pairing of uni (sweetly briny) and iberico lardo (pork buttah) was pure ambrosia but would have been better with a less carby bread and sans the radish and greens.\n\nE N T R E E S\n*Bacon Chop w/ apples, brussellskraut, mustard ($32): http://bit.ly/12jWDJ4\n*Bavette Steak w/ roasted carrots & kombu butter ($33): http://bit.ly/1v4pFmX\n* Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head w/ endive salad & salsa verde dripping sauce ($50): http://bit.ly/1CygR2B; pig ear: http://bit.ly/1tv8zz8\n\nThe bacon chop is a must order for carniwhores! It's 2 lbs of succulent, meaty deliciousness. There's a thick layer of fat lining the chop which keeps it incredibly moist. The bavette steak was uber tender and had a subtle umami flavor from the kombu butter. The pig's head was a wondrous sight that would make most carniwhores cream...and vegetarians scream. I expected it to be uber crunchy like Chinese siu yuk or Filipino lechon but the skin was fatty and gelatinous. To get into the prized cuts of meat like the cheek, you'll have to pry through the thick layers of fat. We barely made a dent into it so I have the leftovers (carcass and all) in the freezer to make pozole at a later time. The leftover salsa verde made with the pig's drippings makes for a great crusty bread dipper. \n\nD E S S E R T\n*\"Classic\" Mandarin Orange Mille Crepe Cake ($7): http://bit.ly/1pH6wvE\n It was too soggy and wet for my liking. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nYou would have never known it was their soft opening because the staff was spectacular! From the hostess, waiters (Josh and David), busboys, and floor managers, everyone was so welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable (of the menu). Chris Cosentino even made his rounds around the dining room chatting with customers. Food service was also very timely. Best soft opening/grand opening that I've been to in 2014!\n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nDark and contemporary with concrete walls, dark furnishings, and Edison bulb lighting. In the main dining room there's 5 two tops, 3 four tops, 1 communal table and 12 counter seats in front of the open kitchen. Additional tables and the second bar is in the mezzanine level. Capacity is 120+. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nDifficult street parking due to ongoing construction. Parking is available across the street at the Wells Fargo lot for $10-$15 (depending on the night). \n\nI'm already planning for a group dinner at Cockscomb after the holidays.

An egg is something that seems so simple yet can be prepared exquisitely, as Cockscomb did. Of course, the flavors of the salmon oil and tarragon aioli added to the well-cooked eggs. The heart beef tartare was a wild adventure in my mouth. Slimy yet firm and flavorful at the same time. It was perfect on top of grilled bread! The Bone Marrow was a combo of beef, pig and lamb marrow.\n \nFor the main show, I got the quail tettrazine. Absolutely heavenly!

You may want to save them ears for your dog at home because it's a great treat.  This item serves 2-3.  The other notable items I want to point out are the Hot Mess and Duck Fat Squash.  The Hot Mess isn't always on the menu (it's a special) but it's basically Foie Gras.  If you're a fan of this delicacy, you don't want to miss out on it.

Thin slices of jalepenos were added for a nice kick, and cucumbers brought a crispness to each bite.\n\n+ OMG this bacon chop ($32). Ok, so.....this thing is huge! Every bite was super tender and it's perfectly grilled and juicy on the inside. We couldn't finish half of it since the other dishes were pretty large as well.\n\nIt was honestly one of the best bacon chops ever, but I found it a little toooo fatty (I had to remove the fat to prevent next-day bloating and meat sweats).\n\n+ This quail tetrazzini ($35) is absolutely heavenly!

And when the food comes out, everyone stops talking. It's time to eat.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here with only my boyfriend. So we ended up sitting at the counter while drooling over everyone else's food.\n\nThe tartare and quail are MUST GETS.

Run for your life  if you hate dark and rich charcuterie boards, the freshest shellfish, including oysters, crab, clams, and lobster, iodine rich and smelling of the sea. \n\nBut if you do like any of these things... Then this place is for you! \n\nEarlier this week we sat down to one glass each  of Mumms Brut Champagne & Mionetto Prosecco while we perused the straightforward yet innovative menu. The prosecco was dry and crisp, while the Mumms balanced dry with a hint of butter. \n\nWe started with a cherry tomato salad ($12), served with fresh herbs and an interesting celery vinaigrette. Light, refreshing, and bursting with summer-garden flavor, we both agreed this dish was a winner. \n\nNext up came the charcuterie ($25 for a platter $45 for a board). Dark, sweet prosciutto, terrine, and njuda, which is a spicey spreadable salami. Curiously perfectly,  good bread had been brushed with olive oil and toasted.. in advance - so by time it got to us it was cold, slightly stale and a bit tough. \n\nDuring all this, we were seated at the bar overlooking the open kitchen, a front row seat to all the action. And what action! Sous chef plunking down a 1.5 pound lobster in a saute pan for the night's special? Check. A truly gigantic lamb shoulder, bone in, being prettied up with herbs before serving in it's own all clad roaster for service? Check. Pin bone steak, cooked rare, being sliced on a board for service? Check. After spying the lobster and seeing it plated for customers, we asked, 'why don't we know about this?' Turns out our server never mentioned the night's lobster on special, you can add it to supplement a steak or bacon chop, ($65) or have it on it's own. \n\nIn the end we opted for the bacon chop with lobster side with summer corn/king trumpet mushroom succatash. Then we had to choose, the double chop or single. Seeing the portions coming outta there I knew the double could feed 4 people not 2, so we opted for the single. Good call, 'cause that single chop was humongous. Lobster served pan roasted with spices and a dipping sauce that was both spicy but low in actual heat. \n\nMoving on from our bubbles we each had a glass or two of the Pertinace Nebbiolo ($12) which pared well with the rich and abundant fare. \n\nFinishing off, we ordered a peach tart, made with a butter crust and fresh whipped cream. Impressed, the host came over with two small glasses of brandy, on the house. \n\nI can whole heartedly recommend Cockscomb, somewhat pricey but you get what you pay for 10 times over.

(See what I did there?)\n\nI'm going to get right into it.  After finding the front door (which is actually the side door, but who cares), we walked into a modern rustic space which was bustling and very lively for an early (6pm) Wednesday evening.  (I later found out they have one of the BEST happy hours in the city!)  After checking in, we were graciously escorted to our table on the second level which was quieter and more conducive to putting your face down and \"pigging out\".  (Meh meh meh ... You'll understand why I think that's funny in a minute ... )\n\nUnfortunately, I can't remember what cocktails we had (It was a good night - what can I say?), but for an appetizer we ordered the Beef Heart Tartar with a raw egg.  I may have been a teeny bit apprehensive about the flavor before I tried it, but once I did, all fear and dignity flew out the window.  I scarfed down about half a cow's heart with some unfertilized chicken ova like nobody ever did before.  A bit gamy in the sense that it had a slightly metallic flavor, not quite as pungent as liver ... along those lines.  But I like liver too.  \n\nOnto the mains.  It hurts a little bit to think about how much we ate and how rich it was but you'll get zero complaints from this gal because tasty, rich and filling was what we were going for.  And it was all very tasty.\n\nWe ordered the Chef's plate de jour, which was Foie Gras, Pig Trotters and Pickled Green Strawberries served with crostini.  Yes.  Everything you could wish for and more.  Foie Gras.  That is all.  No wait - that's not all because it was cooked to perfection and had the perfect Melt-In-Your-Mouth consistency.  The pig trotters reminded me of pulled pork but bathing in Foie Gras glory and then complimented by the tartness of the pickled green strawberries.  What?\n\nNow onto the real main dish.  We ordered the Half a Roasted Pig's Head.  It's a shared supper - I would say for more than 2 people ... Possibly, OH about 6 to 8?  Yeah, I know.  What were we thinking?  It was huge.  I was obviously in denial about how big pigs can be.  This was NOT your everyday teacup variety.  But delicious!  It was like a huge platter of pork belly ... with a snout, teeth and a crispy fried ear.  Yum!  I think there was some salad on the platter ... But we didn't dabble in the frivolous items.  We took a LOT home and my wee maltese doggy had pig face for  d a y s.  (Don't judge me - She's 11yo and has earned it).  Btw, she's still VERY happy and has a clean bill of health.  No animals were harmed in the making of this review.\n\nWe had dessert too.  Something chocolate that we couldn't finish.  It was his birthday - I had to order cake!  Ugh.

Did I miss the bandwagon (and I'm all for reppin' this city)? I'm just utterly disappointed.\n\nThe grilled cheese. For $20, this was not the best I've had in my life. I love smelly, good cheese. What I don't like, smelly, bad cheese. I've never been so offended. Mind you, we're a Filipino and Thai household. We love, bagoong, patis, and deep fried fish head, but this sandwich was rough. I saw the truffle shavings, but its essence was no where to be found. Honey was lacking and was not enough to balance out the audacity of the cheese.\n\n3 pieces of Uni on a plate of salad.

A solid duet.\n\nLastly, we ordered the bacon chop, moist and flavorful. It comes with a salad. A solid dish for my paleo only friends.

On the second sip I realized it was the cocktail), and invasion of the body snatchers. The body snatchers was my fave of the four. It wasn't too sweet and the blood orange with maple was an enjoyable treat.\n\nThe ambiance was like every other hipster establishment in the city.

My BF had the & Chips which he thought was decent. It was a long and narrow pork sausage with a skin casing that had a great snap to it.

Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that).

I ordered this since there wasn't much greens involved throughout the meal and upon seeing a good review of it from someone else who dined there, I ordered without hesitation.

Food was very good and unlike any unoriginal \"fancy date\" places.. Service started slow but ended well with needs being met.  Chef Cosentino is the man.\n\n----\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation and were seated right away at the counter facing the kitchen.  The ambiance was dress casual, seating is pretty cozy as my elbow bumped into my neighbor on occasion during the meal.  It can be loud too so if you're looking for an intimate evening, I probably wouldn't suggest this.  That being said, it's still a good date place, or even a small group date.  We saw Chris Cosentino walking around and even got a picture with him!\n\nService - While it took a few minutes for the waiter to finally come take our order.  The service started slow but ended up being pretty good.  Our waiter was probably overworked... The attentive-ness was the good side side of the border between good and not-good.  I'd say getting the waiter's attention was along the lines of, \"I'm really starting to wonder where my waiter was\"  And just before you start to get impatient he shows up.  Once the orders went in though, things ran smooth, and the waiters and other servers made sure we were happy.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful despite the slow start.  Sitting at the counter and watching all the action in the kitchen was also a great way to wait.  We saw our food getting prepared and everything!\n\nFood - Between my date and I, we had:\nGrilled Cheese with Honey and Truffle - Cheesy, buttery, sweet. Apparently it's the thing to get at cockscomb.  I'd say it's probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had.  [But I should probably caveat that in saying... it's probably the first \"gourmet\"/fancy grilled cheese I've ever had... unless you count Kraft singles as fancy cheese]\n\nBacon Chop - Man that's one huge hunk of meat.  When I first got it, it looked normal size with some salad on the side.  But nope, brush off the salad to reveal the whole other half of the bacon chop.  The salad was good, had some thin carrot slices, parsley and some other stuff.  I suppose that \"balances\" the meal ever so slightly with me eating the 2 pounds of bacon chop.  Although I admit i \"saved\" some weight by not eating all the fat that's part of the bacon chop.  Speaking of, the taste of the chop was great with the sauce.  The chop itself was cooked right, a touch of very light pink and very juicy.  This bacon chop is why i suggest a \"small group\" date because 2 lbs of bacon chop is a lot.  \n\nButchers Choice - Pork-skin spaghetti.  So apparently you can make pasta out of pork skin.   Very good pasta actually.  I would describe it as a better tasting udon noodle.  I will say though, personal preference is for pasta sauce to be light and \"barely there\"  This was definitely not that.  But the sauce was tasty, but once we ate all the spaghetti, there was definitely a surplus of the sauce leftover.\n\nChocolate Dessert - We had the brule'd marshmallow on top of chocolate pastry brick (I don't know what to call it, it's like a brownie but way more dense) with a chocolate mousse thing on the side.

Wasn't bad, but didn't knock my socks off.\n\nPork Skin Linguine with Clams: The pork skin linguine is made of pork skin, but is mushy, gelatinous, and overall just really fatty. Interesting idea,chef is definitely trying to \"do something new\" but it was pretty disgusting.\n\nBest items we had were, ironically, fish or vegetarian: tartare was tasty, roasted beet entree was delicious, and grilled cheese with truffle tasted like dessert. \n\nOverall this place was a bust. For calling themselves meat experts, it was obvious they don't know how to cook, season, or present meat. We could cook a better meal at home.

It was bursting with wonderful flavors of Vietnamese herbs that complimented the tuna. Next came the Beef Heart Tartare.

Chunky, twice-fried nuggets of potatoes that are impossibly crispy on the outside and creamy inside. These should be made into their own side dish. They were soooo much better than the side dishes we actually ordered. \n\nPretty good:\n-BACON CHOP apples, brussellskraut & mustard: not a Tomahawk size, but the pretty damn biggest serving of meat that I've had in awhile. I dug into it immediately and barely put a dent in it. But that's probably because I had to cut through 2-3\" of fat to get to the meat. If you're not okay with fat and gristle (which you don't have to eat, but which I did sneak bites of), you may be disgusted by the Bacon Chop. Bacon is ideal name for this chop as there are several thick layers of fat interlaced with meat. As I was cutting through the fat & gristle, I had a flashback to that scene from The Great Outdoors where John Candy gnaws and sweats his way through a 96oz steak. This pork chop was not on that level, but definitely reminiscent. The THICK layers of fat do serve a purpose tho. The resulting meat is enveloped in juicy layers of fat, self-basting itself with juices and super tender and juicy to the bite. The chop was probably brined as well to up the juicy-quotient. The apples/brusselskraut seemed more of an afterthought for me and it didn't stand out. I wish this dish came with a starch b/c the meat portion was daunting and needed something to contrast/offset it. I barely ate a third of it and I couldn't even bring myself to finish the leftovers for lunch because of all the fat. \n\n-COUNTRY PATE pistachios, cornichons, butter: one of the better country pates I've had in awhile. the pate was rustic and meaty and you could really savor and taste distinct pieces of meat in it\n\n-LITTLE GEMS green goddess, radish & cracklins: a nice beginning to the meal. the lighter, sweeter pieces of the romaine variety were a nice contrast to the crisp radish and the crunchy, slightly saltly cracklin pieces \n\n-\"HAM\"BURGER grilled onions, gruyere cheese, Dijon & fried potatoes: the server described it as as a ground pork patty, but it tasted and felt more like a salty bits of ham cold cuts that had been ground up and re-fashioned into a patty. The doughy bun, grilled onions and melted cheese made for a tasty sandwich, but it definitely doesn't pack the beef \"meatiness\" that you crave from a traditional hamburger. \n\n-\"& CHIPS\": a fancy version of traditional British bangers and mash, or sausages and mashed potatoes. The pork sausage itself was meaty, but the texture left something to be desired. It was slightly dry and I was craving a bit more fat content. The taste is interesting as well: super herbaceous, bright, and citrusy. \n\n-MARKET VEGETABLE weather dependent: roasted acorn squash \n\nOkay, but I would pass: \n-'EGGS, EGGS, EGGS' salmon roe & tarragon aioli: a creamy poached chicken egg, 2 poached quail eggs, and salmon roe atop a creamy, herbacious tarragon aioli. The combination of the luscious broken yolks, delicate egg whites, and aioli made for a light, yet decadent mouthful. The bright pops of saltiness from the salmon roe were an interesting side  note. However, it came with one hard piece of table bread. This would've been better if more thought was put into the accompanying bread, like if it were a buttered, toasted brioche. \n\n-CRUDO OF THE DAY: while crudo and ceviche are very similar, we felt that this was more of a ceviche preparation because it was served with tortilla chips. Pretty non-descript. \n\n-BROCCOLI RABE garlic, lemon, chili & breadcrumbs\n\n-DUCK FAT CAULIFLOWER red fresno, garlic, caper & mint\n\nI would like to give Cockscomb another chance and try other items on the menu (especially the shared suppers), but for now 3.5 stars for the food.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-01-08"}, {"excerpts": ["All the dishes we ordered tasted fine but none was particularly memorable, except for the bacon chop that stood out for being undercooked.

My friend had been raving about this place for a while, so we made plans to go here a month in advance and made a reservation.\n\nService was perfect. Very friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and always kept our water filled.\n\nFood:\n\nAsparagus Starter - very acidic, green, fresh, crisp salad. Almost like taking a mouthful of grass.\n\nButcher's Choice for the day - Morel Mushrooms + Cow Udder in a creamy white sauce. The morel mushrooms were delicious, but the cow udder was basically lightly fried fat. It got sickening really quickly.\n\nBacon Chop - 80% fat, 20% meat. The fat was good (fat is always tasty), but it got really really sickening.\n\nMeat Pie - Ingredients change daily. Mine had oysters, beef, carrots, and collared greens. Beef was tough and chewy. The pie was very disappointing. I was expecting an actual pie with a thick meat filling, but it was just a piece of crust on top of a bowl of watery soup, with no crust around the filling. The filling was, like mentioned, watery soup filled with oysters and unchewable beef.\n\nAt this point, we were disappointed with the meat pie and completely sick of all the fat from the bacon chop, so we decided to order the grilled cheese to get some carbs in.\n\nGrilled Cheese - Brie-filled grilled cheese sandwich perfectly fried, drizzled with honey, and topped with a sunny side up duck egg. In my opinion, it was the best dish of the night.\n\nFor desserts, we got the chocolate and the fruit desserts:\n\nChocolate hazelnut ganache cake topped with clotted cream - absolutely perfect. Moist, delicious, not too sweet.\n\nStrawberry Shortcake with mint leaves and rhubarb - the shortcake wasn't moist. It felt kind of old and dry. The mint was very refreshing though (the whipped cream seemed to be infused with mint as well), and the strawberries were tart and tasty.\n\nHere's the not so fun part. As soon as I finished eating, I had an upset stomach. After I got home, I threw up, and the morning after, I had uncontrollable diarrhea for hours.\n\nSo, in summary, this was my experience with Cockscomb:\n\n- Good service.\n- Tons of things not listed on the menu, such as Surf & Turf and Hot Mess. Pretty damn annoying. I know the ingredients change every day, but at least put the name of the dish on the menu. I don't want to be repeatedly asking the waiter for the specials (\"Hey, can we have the thing you mentioned that has cow udder in it? Oh that's called Butcher's Choice? Okay yea I want that.\").\n- Everything just has WAYYY TOO MUCH FAT. Like solid cubes and globs of lard.\n- The only dishes I truly enjoyed were the grilled cheese and the chocolate cake.\n- I got some kind of indigestion or food poisoning afterwards.\n- After tip, the bill came out to $75 per person (2 people total).\n\nI might come back to try out the pinbone steak instead sometime, but for now, I don't think I even want to look at meat.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-04-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Bacon chop big dish "], "author": "Yona F.", "review": "Good food, good vibes, service without personal touch ( too busy).good food, grilled cheese whatever you have heard is correct , shrimps avocado ;creative and fine ,highly recommend ,the foia gra is overrated.

Prior to this evening; I had NO idea that he was a Celebrity Chef (I knew he was a SF Chef, but really NO clue about the rest), no idea that he grew up in Rhode Island and no idea that he's an entrepreneur with a sausage outpost at San Francisco's Ferry Building. I didn't know about Iron Chef; i simply didn't know about the brainstorm behind the experience I had tonight that I am about to share with all of you. All I knew was this was a place to get great meat, great drinks and Cherrystones. Being from MA, I crave a little bit of home every now and then. Cockscomb is THE PLACE for lobster, clams, oysters, real meat on the grill, potatoes cooked just like Grammy used to...THEY USE REAL BUTTER! The entire thing, everything...its done with love. The ambiance, the music, the little tongue-in-cheek labels on the hand drier in the bathroom...the line of (mostly super smokin' hot men) cooking, burning themselves, sweating their balls off; literally...all in the name of great food for YOU, Me...and everyone that walks through the threshold of this glorious masterpiece.\n\nThere are 3 ways that captivate my heart and create loyalty; authenticity, the little details and great food. From the moment I opened the door to this amazing venue everyone on 'Team Cockscomb' was attentive, courteous and professional. My friend and I were seated at the bar, which is perfect for 2 single girls enjoying the open kitchen and everything else that is sensory overload for a good solid hour. I was welcomed by a wonderful man that let me know just as part of my conversation where the bathroom was located and where the 'hooks for your purse' are located. PHENOMENAL. It's not that I don't ever leave my home and people aren't nice to me; it's just awesome to experience great attention to the 'little things' when you aren't expecting it. The Yelp reviews lead me to this place, but don't do any justice when it comes to really, truly experiencing what it's like to dine here. \n\nOur Server knew my name, he knew it was a Birthday Dinner for me (which was not necessary, I have generous friends). I liked the guy so much I hugged him twice...once at the beginning of our meal and at the end when he told me how great we were. HE was the great one. I mean this guy Gabriel...he gave us a tour of the menu, explained the details, helped us feel at home and everything...was PERFECT. We tried the oysters, the cherry-stones (which were fabulous). The avocado enhancement was killer, I wish I knew exactly what that was because it's creamy and so yummy on the raw shellfish. Never have I had that, and I love it much more than a mignonette. We also asked for the beef heart tartare with roasted/pan fried/buttered potatoes (I want a bucket of them so I can be in a carb coma); whoa! you have to order this. The foie gras...best I've ever had. The bacon chop; it's enough for 4 people. The thing is HUGE and yummy, bacony...again, I'd never had this cut of meat and I hardly eat pork. You must get this. We also tried the chocolate...and yes...the cheese. Chocolate was decadent, rich, chocolatey...I much preferred the cheese. Bleu, honey, walnuts, jam...yum. We left with a doggie bag. I left with a new found love for a slice of my home in San Francisco. The entire evening I felt like I was in the company of an old friend and now it makes complete sense why.

We are both the type who like to go out and try new places and she mentioned Cockscomb. I didn't know about the place and did my research. I was so busy during the entire week I forgot to call the reservation line at 3PM. We decided to be rebellious and go on a Friday night and try our luck. Oh boy did we luck out! We didn't have to wait because there were seats upstairs by the bar that overlooked the entire lower dining room. Sick view, great food, good drinks and amazing company. \n\nIt was Friday so we started with some cocktails. I got the Pisco Punch and A got the Boothby. Both drinks were good. Mine had a nice tartness to it that I really enjoyed and the boothby was nice if you enjoyed a tropical coconut type flavor. \n\nWe decided to go all out on food and try everything that stood out to us. We started with the \"Hot Mess\" - seared foie gras. This was my first time having foie gras since they lifted the ban here in SF. It was definitely melt in your mouth, but not sure how we felt exactly about it being cold since it was seared. Good, but could have done without.\n\nNext up was the grilled cheese with honey and shaved truffles. Now this was a palate pleaser. The cheese and the honey complimented each other so well and the saltiness of the truffle was a little undermined but still a nice touch to the classic sandwich.\n\nFor our main courses we had the Quail Tetrazzini and the Coulotte Steak.\n\nThese two by far were our favorite dishes of the night. The quail had an amazing flavor to it and was complimented with this delicious white wine sauce with mushrooms and had some crispy noodle pieces to really give it that extra texture. The steak was seasoned to perfection and had a great charred taste to it. My taste buds were singing of joy. \n\nThe restaurant has great service. Everyone was pleasant and our server/bartender/do it all girl was amazing and brought us one of their house drinks that was AMAZING. Super refreshing and if I ever find myself at Cockscomb again, that WILL be my drink of choice. I'm not sure what it was called exactly, but I think it was one of the drinks with gin and jasmine.. or was it lavender water?

I ordered the quail and loved how juicy and tender the meat was. I also loved the variety of mushrooms included in the dish as I'm a huge mushroom lover. My BF had the & Chips which he thought was decent. It was a long and narrow pork sausage with a skin casing that had a great snap to it. The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that). I tried my friend's Calf's Liver and it surprisingly didn't have that strong of an iron taste that most livers have and was tender. Very glad I tried it. My other friends said they enjoyed their dishes as well, especially the Bavette Steak as it was perfectly cooked.\n\nService was fantastic. Watchful eyes constantly had our waters filled and napkins folded when we walked away. Empty plates quickly cleared away. One of our friends had all his drinks and dishes picked by our waiter and he enjoyed his choices. Definitely an interesting experience for him.\n\nChef Cosentino was there prepping many of the meals that night and showing the other chefs what to do. It was thrilling to watch him work! Our server found out that I was a fan of Chef Cosentino and checked to see if he would be willing to take a picture. He was busy but our server wouldn't let me leave until I got a picture (he actually blocked the door!). I'm super shy so one of my friends was able to get Chef Cosentino's attention to get a picture.

It's a pretty big chop, and i made the mistake of starting on the larger, meaty end, where the lean meat was.  The lean portion of the chop just tasted like an average pork chop, unfortunately.  That part is a 3/5 at most.  The good stuff is all of the fatty goodness surrounding the meat.  This part is a 4/5.

I figured my best bet to get in, w/o a reservation, was a Monday evening and I was right.  I slid in to a seat at the bar without a wait.  I started off with the daily special of steam mussels ($8 that night).  They were fresh and a good size and portion.  The sauce was a simple butter and white wine from what I could tell and wasn't distracting from the mussels themselves.  Since foie gras is now legal in SF I had to get an appetizer that contained that.  I was recommended to try the \"Hot Mess\" (picture uploaded) and my mouth is still drooling over this.  It sounded a bit funky but the taste was amazing.  The Hot Mess is grilled sour dough bread covered with strawberry jam/preserves, topped with grilled foie gras, smothered in melted duck fat (and I think some duck meat, but I'm not sure on that).  Granted mine wasn't as picturesque as some of the others I've seen posted here on yelp but that didn't detract from the flavor.  Was a meal, a desert, or both?  I'm not sure but it was damned good.  I decided not to get another Hot Mess but instead try something different and went for the Quail Tetrazzini.  It looked like the smallest, size wise, entry I could order as I was getting full from the 2 appetizers but wanted the chance to try one more thing before I called it for the night.\n\nI loved the open kitchen concept as well as the farm to table style dishes.

The slices of grilled bread were just too big and just overpowered the taste of the tartare.\n\n- \"Hot Mess\" off-menu special: I wish I remembered the full details of this, but all I can recall is that it involved foie gras.

The meat was so tender that once you ate the skin, all the meat underneath just fell apart with a slight touch of the fork, and every part from the eye to the cheek tasted deliciously savory, rich, and all around just perfect. A bonus - A brain aioli dipping sauce for all of the skin and meat. Honestly this was one of the most decadent and most pleasurable eating experiences of my life.

Overall: very good experience, and once they get everything really dialed in I think this could be great. \n\nGin Jam cocktail: Fine, but nothing special, lacking a bit of punch/vibrancy. Nothing wrong with it, but I'd prob stick to beer or wine here (which imo accompany this food better anyway).\n\nUni butter, lardo, and dungeness crab bruschetta: Disappointing only because they said uni butter and there was absolutely zero uni taste at all. If they hadn't said that, would have been very happy with a tasty bruschetta with a great combo of crab and lardo.\n\nDuck fat cauliflower: very good, exactly as expected.\n\nRoasted pig's head: This was almost as epic looking as the whole beast at Incanto. Giant pig's head with a ton of meat to dig into. Tender, flavorful meat from all parts of the head, lots of delicious crispy fatty skin, and an extra-tasty ear. We tackled this with two of us, but I'd probably recommend this as a better dish for 4-6 people with other mains alongside. Great dish, and apparently they run out pretty early. Only minor issue with this dish is it comes with some endives that get a little oily on that plate and don't end up contrasting enough with this intensely rich dish, but that's a small nitpick about an excellent dish.\n\nThe dessert menu was like we got transported to a minimalist tasting menu restaurant - entries were \"chocolate, classic, (something else), cheese\" with no other info, so it was useless without having them explained. No big deal, just seems silly. Was totally stuffed at this point anyway.\n\nService was good. Sat at the bar, bartender was very nice and pretty knowledgeable about the menu. Rest of service staff was very good, everything went smoothly.\n\n$80 each with not much drinking.

Almost like taking a mouthful of grass.\n\nButcher's Choice for the day - Morel Mushrooms + Cow Udder in a creamy white sauce. The morel mushrooms were delicious, but the cow udder was basically lightly fried fat. It got sickening really quickly.\n\nBacon Chop - 80% fat, 20% meat. The fat was good (fat is always tasty), but it got really really sickening.\n\nMeat Pie - Ingredients change daily. Mine had oysters, beef, carrots, and collared greens. Beef was tough and chewy. The pie was very disappointing. I was expecting an actual pie with a thick meat filling, but it was just a piece of crust on top of a bowl of watery soup, with no crust around the filling. The filling was, like mentioned, watery soup filled with oysters and unchewable beef.\n\nAt this point, we were disappointed with the meat pie and completely sick of all the fat from the bacon chop, so we decided to order the grilled cheese to get some carbs in.\n\nGrilled Cheese - Brie-filled grilled cheese sandwich perfectly fried, drizzled with honey, and topped with a sunny side up duck egg. In my opinion, it was the best dish of the night.\n\nFor desserts, we got the chocolate and the fruit desserts:\n\nChocolate hazelnut ganache cake topped with clotted cream - absolutely perfect. Moist, delicious, not too sweet.\n\nStrawberry Shortcake with mint leaves and rhubarb - the shortcake wasn't moist. It felt kind of old and dry. The mint was very refreshing though (the whipped cream seemed to be infused with mint as well), and the strawberries were tart and tasty.\n\nHere's the not so fun part.

Pretty damn annoying. I know the ingredients change every day, but at least put the name of the dish on the menu. I don't want to be repeatedly asking the waiter for the specials (\"Hey, can we have the thing you mentioned that has cow udder in it? Oh that's called Butcher's Choice? Okay yea I want that.\").\n- Everything just has WAYYY TOO MUCH FAT. Like solid cubes and globs of lard.\n- The only dishes I truly enjoyed were the grilled cheese and the chocolate cake.\n- I got some kind of indigestion or food poisoning afterwards.\n- After tip, the bill came out to $75 per person (2 people total).\n\nI might come back to try out the pinbone steak instead sometime, but for now, I don't think I even want to look at meat.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-04-26"}, {"excerpts": ["- Meat pie: pork belly, snails, black mushrooms.

It had a nice black pepper kick to it\n- Butcher's choice: calves liver - loved the mushrooms with it, but liver just isn't my thing\n- Meat pie: pork belly, snails, black mushrooms.

The portions are fairly big, but you want to try a bunch of different items.\nSecond tip:  make a dinner reservation, even during the week.  This place always seems full, even on random Wednesday nights.

No dinner options for this popular (and curious) meal.\nFourth tip:  even though meat is the big draw here, leave some room for dessert.  After all the savory flavors, some sweet treats at the end of the meal are always welcome.\n\nSince the menu always changes, I will just highlight some of my most memorable dishes:\n\nPin bone steak:  one of the few non-rotating choices, it's listed under the \"Shared Suppers\" section.

Served with a bone marrow dip, the steak is luxurious and food-coma inducing.  \n\nWood oven roasted pigs head:  always a head turner, this \"Shared Supper\" (also a menu staple) is not for the faint of heart.  The head of any animal is underrated by diners, with some of the most tender and flavorful meat inside the cheeks and neck of a beast.  The pig's head is no exception.  The skin was crispy from the oven-roasting and the meat among the most tasty I've ever had.  In addition, the dish is served with 2 different sauces on the side, both made from the pork \"drippings.\"  My wife & I shared this at one meal, but we had a difficult time sleeping that night, since that meal was so heavy.  You have been warned.\n\nCountry pate:  Sometimes this is offered by itself, other times as part of the charcuterie platter.  But it's the best pate I've ever had.  The meat is not so finely ground, but chunky instead, served with some very crusty bread.  I've been tempted to pick up an order of the pate to go and walk into AT&T Park with it, eating this while watching a Giants game (which would be SO San Francisco of me!).\n\nButcher's Choice:  this is usually one of the daily specials.

I simply liked the brave offerings on their menu and simply have heard enough good things from their execution.\n\nI like the look of the space, very casual.  Busy and loud on the ground floor, due to the kitchen and probably where the regulars hang out.  Urban loft look upstairs with dark, minimalist tones.  Urban art is riddled throughout the space, which I liked big time.\n\nStarted with Oeufs Mayonaise ($13) which is their deviled egg rendition.  Great, one of the better ones I've had.  Super creamy yolk that was bursting with seasoned egg flavor.  Nice herb mayo on the bottom of the plate to make it even more creamy and indulgent.  And a tiny sliver of crisp chicken skin as a garnish was a nice touch.  Almost wished there were more.\n\nSipped on their house Martini ($12) and it was extremely spot on.  Quality gin, herby vermouth and briny olives.  Chilled and perfect.  Stuck with these for the duration of the whole meal to counter all the richness of the food.\n\nSmoked Oyster Chowder ($14) was on special and we couldn't resist.  Execution was precise and kraft-worthy.  Creamy with the perfect consistency.  Skillfully diced tender Yukon potato.  And maybe 3-4, mildly smoked oysters.  So mild that some of the oysters had a rawish texture.  And when put all together, made for a stellar soup course.\n\nSince it was our first time, we indulged in their Half Pig's Head Dish ($69).  There's 2 things about this dish;  1) it is pretty hardcore and not for casual meat eaters;  2) it is a lot of food that can be shared amongst 4 people.  There were only 2 of us, so we didn't even come close to finishing it.  But they pack things up nicely.\n\nI've had many different pig parts in my time, but I've never had all parts of the head before me.  It was good, real good.  But it is just so rich with fat and sticky gelatinous tissue that you seem to get your fill pretty quick.  Our version, the skin was really crisp.  So crisp it was hard to carve.  Super tasty, but super sticky on the tooth.\n\nWe enjoyed the diverse textures and flavors of the different areas.  Ears, cheeks and jaw muscles are all so different.  2 sauces came with, one an herbaceous jus and another some creamy mayo.  Both really good.  Lots of chicory salad to accompany, which is a great contrast to the rich meat.\n\nFor dessert we chose their Pineapple Upside Down Cake ($7) rendition, and I loved it.  It was a total twist on most other versions.  First the cake seemed like it had cornmeal or polenta in it, a little gritty.  But the slightly sweet corn flavor was great.  Some dried berry on top (could be currants or dried blueberry) along with the pineapple added the tart fruit component while soft cream tied everything together.  Very nice adult oriented dessert, sugar levels totally in check.\n\nNow that I've knocked the pig's head dish off my culinary bucket list, I can now venture into the rest of their menu.  Their family style dishes all sound so good, from a sharable pin bone steak to a pork belly and scallop platter that seemed intriguing.

Thanks for the excellent food!\n\nCame here for a birthday dinner on Saturday night. We had a reservation for 5 and I was the first to arrive 15 mins early, but our table was already ready and after I was brought there, the staff showed me where the bar was and suggested I could either hangout at the bar and waited at the table. Very thoughtful service!\n\nIt's not a big menu but all the dishes names sound very tempting. And since it is so hard to decide.... we just went ahead with the \"Shared Supper\" items and got both of them plus two other appetizers.\n\n#Beef Heart Tartare - Appetizers ($16): A.\nBeef tartare is pretty common but beef heart? It turned out to be pretty delicious. The meat definitely contained a lot more fat, and the texture was more smooth than regular beef tartare. I actually almost felt like eating fatty tuna tartare. Used it as a spread on grilled bread. Wonderful.\n\n#Octopus A La Plancha - Appetizers ($18): B.\nNot sure about this one. Portion was very small, and there were only few pieces of octopus plus some vegetables. Not recommended.\n\n#Pin Bone Steak - Shared Supper ($110): A+.\nFirst off, the price did justify at least from the portion point of view - this dish alone could have fed 6 people. And the steak itself was bomb! Very, very nicely cooked. Even though the bone size was enormous, every piece of meat I tasted was almost at the same level of rawness (borderline of rare and medium rare). Very juicy, very tender. This dish came with two sauces: bone marrow sauce and red wine sauce. Honestly I could not taste much from the bone marrow sauce, probably the flavor from bone marrow was sort of on the light side. But the red wine sauce was definitely worth to be put on the steak. Some vege that came with this dish definitely helped balanced my stomach a little bit.\n\n#Wood Oven Roasted Pig Head - Shared Supper ($65): A+.\nThis dish alone could have fed another 4 people! What a big head. For anyone that has tried Chinese style roasted pig before this dish actually reminded me exactly that. The skin was crispy (not brittle enough to a point that it would break once you bite on it though) but the meat / fat underneath was WOW. It was actually a huge amount of fat. If it was not cooked properly it would actually feel pretty nasty to put so much fat in your mouth at the same time. Nothing like that from this dish. Very flavorful and the temperature was just about right. The meat tasted like moist pulled pork with lots of flavor too.\n\nSome other notes:\n- Cocktails were great. We tried \"The Towering Inferno\" (gin and ginger beer based) and \"About Cherry Sling\" (gin and cherry based) and both were very refreshing, not too strong and tasted very fruity.\n- Service was wonderful. Our server was wonderful and very attentive, and very energetic when explaining the menu to us. The cocktails above were actually suggested by him, he surely knows what's good there.\n- At the end of our dinner Chef Chris Cosentino walked out from the kitchen, sat down at our table chatted with us for quite a bit of time! He explained his philosophy of this restaurant, his goal about customer experience, what new dish he is working on etc. A very nice and passionate chef. We got to take a picture with him too!\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience with amazing food.

Thats also how long it took to finish the left overs!  Nestled right across the street from where I used to live in SOMA, it is unassuming in front, but once inside, it is well laid out, seems bigger than it is space.  The open kitchen makes the dimly lit room more lively and exciting than your standard $$$ dining room.\n\nBut really, this place is about the food...and when I mean food I mean the different meat platters!!!  Okay, so we started off with the Grilled Cheese with Egg and Honey.  As far grilled cheeses go, you really can't get better than this.  Well you can, I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't the Truffle Grilled cheese I saw in pics on yelp, but I guess its not truffle season. Never the less, excellent grilled cheese.  The next dish was the pig ears and cabbage salad.  Similar to a Vietnamese salad dish, it was a bit tangy and spicy.  However, I probably would have enjoyed the pig ears by themselves, without all the cabbage and dressing.\n\nAfter wetting our appetites, we continued on to the heavier plates.  The beef heart tartare was delicious, but not for the faint of heart...  BEEFY is the best way to describe the flavor and the bread was perfectly grilled and buttered!  SO GOOD!  The butcher's choice was lamb heart with yellow zucchini.  It was well seasoned and cooked, but it just wasn't my thing.\n\nThe main event featured the heavy weight of the heavy weights!  Pine Bone Steak with Bone Marrow Dip!  The steak took a while, but after the seeing the size of it, you understand why.  Must have been at least 3 pounds!  The charring and seasoning was excellent.  The edges were a bit over cooked but it was darn near perfect the rest of the way.  The bone marrow dip was so flavorful and added an extra kick for your taste buds.  Of course the Au Jus kept it moist and juicy!  \n\nOverall, I loved the experience at Cockscomb!  Will definitely come back for the pig's head!!!

It was still good, but we both felt the buttermilk ranch dressing was a little too much.. too much dressing and a bit salty. \n\nBeef heart tartar 5/5: This dish was delicious. Everything about it was perfect. The seasonings, texture, flavor, and even the crusted bread that came with it. Highly recommend!! \n\nWood oven's pig head 5/5: Although this item was really rich (as everyone says), I feel like it was still really good. Great crispy skin and flavor. People who complain about the head being too rich and knocking off points for it is being unreasonable. I feel like this dish isn't meant for just 2 people to eat it.. and it isn't a MAIN dish.  Because it's so rich, it should be shared and even having a little portion of it is enough.  My bf and I decided to get it because we just had to. You can't find anything else like that in the city. \n\nOld Fashion 5/5: The bartender made this drink perfect. \n\nOverall, we had a great anniversary dinner here.

The. Meat. Vegetarian? Yeah don't come here.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nAh, this is an hard review to have to write. I was definitely on the hype train for Cockscomb, given all the great things that I'd heard from friends about it. We came as a group of six, and, unfortunately, had to limit our pork options since one person in our party didn't eat it, leading to orders of the:\n\n* Squid... something - Probably the tastiest dish of the night, which is unfortunate because there were six of us, and one of this little appetizer/side. And, yet, oddly, none of us remember exactly what it was we ordered: I'm inclined to think it was a pasta dish, but don't quote me on that.\n\n* Pig Skin Noodles - My hearing must not be what it once was, because I completely misheard/understood how this dish was prepared, after asking our waiter, thinking it was pig skin inside a noodle dish. But nope, the noodles themselves are actually made from pig skin :o Tasty, and, as you'd expect, incredibly rich and fatty. The texture of the \"noodles\" is, well, chewy and squishy, so prepare yourselves.\n\n* Pin Bone Steak - So, this was the centerpiece. Some tables went with the pig head, some with this, and others with both. Given the aforementioned pork limiter, we opted for the steak, and... any disappointment I had lay almost entirely in this dish. Yes, the quality of the meat was quite good, but our medium rare steak ended up coming out more as a rare steak, and one that seemed unseasoned, almost. I'm not usually one to complain about bland food, since I eat lighter than most, but EVERYONE in our group thought this was bland, even with the provided jus and bone marrow dip. It was bland enough that we had to bust out the salt shaker, which I haven't done since... 15 years ago?\n\n* Panna Cotta - Not something I usually order because, well, I'm lactose intolerant, but that I've somehow probably had more of than any other fancier dessert. And theirs was QUITE delicious, creamy, and rich.\n\nSide dishes aren't enough to save a restaurant, and, while I rarely given two star first experiences a second chance, there's a good chance I will with Cockscomb, since my friends insisted that this was probably a one off fluke. So, until then, 2.5 stars for the place.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak for the main floor of the restaurant, but they do have an elevator that goes up to the second floor, where I'm guessing the larger parties are seated.

The sweetness of the honey...the richness of the egg...the saltiness and melty texture of the cheese.  It's really well balanced.    \n\nThe albacore collar is huge!  I thought we were getting a small piece of fish collar like what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant, but this seemed like the tuna's entire collar!  The herbs and peppercorns that it's roasted with taste really good even without a bite of fish.  The meat is tender, fatty, tasty.  This is a must try if you see it as a special again.  \n\nThe portion of mushrooms was a little smaller than I had expected but they were good.\n\nWhat carnivore doesn't want a massive board of steak?  The pin bone steak has both the bottom and top sirloin.  I'm a medium rare guy, and it was cooked to perfection.  On the side you have an au jus that's good, but I really loved the bone marrow sauce that also comes on the side. Spoon a little bit over your steak and you're living the dream!\n\nThe bacon chop...a giant, roasted slab of pork belly.  Wow!\n\nThe blueberry cobbler wasn't your standard heavy cobbler.  You get a lot of fruit topped with some granola and a thick quenelle of a lemon cream.  It's not very sweet.  I would have preferred a little more sweetness but everybody else at the table really enjoyed it.  \n\nThis isn't a true profiterole...I just don't remember what they called it.  This dish had a profiterole-like texture but was shaped like a thin bagel, cut in half and filled with chocolate and whipped cream.  This was definitely sweeter than the blueberry cobbler and I loved it.\n\n4 hungry people ate this meal.  I'm glad that my wife and I didn't eat much during the day because this was a massive amount of awesome food.   We had enough leftovers to feed a 5th person, but that was on purpose.  We were super satisfied with our meal.\n\nCome here with friends and share lots of food.

Pretty much, this is the seat where I was drooling over all the items I didn't order, but wanted to... like this MASSIVE pin bone steak with bone marrow dip.\n\nThis is Chris Cosentino's latest restaurant in San Francisco. He's the winner of Top Chef Masters and even had his own show on the Food Network (Chefs VS. City).\n\nFor all you meat lovers and red-blooded carnivores, this is where you NEED to be. Trust me. The menu reflects Cosentino's background in butchery and his love of offal is obvious: there's even a wood oven-roasted pig's head on the menu.\n\nSide: The HUGE pig head kinda freaks me out, so if I'm feeling a bit more ballzy next time... I might order it.\n\nNow moving onto the food, here's what we had:\n\n+ Beef heart tartare is unlike anything I've ever had ($16). It comes with a helping of arugula and seasoned potatoes which were so on point! The quality of the meat was super fresh and it got me really excited for everything else to come. It's probably one of the best appetizers on the menu.\n\n+ Crudo of the day ($16) was dressed similar to a ceviche style, using lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos were added for a nice kick, and cucumbers brought a crispness to each bite.\n\n+ OMG this bacon chop ($32). Ok, so.....this thing is huge! Every bite was super tender and it's perfectly grilled and juicy on the inside. We couldn't finish half of it since the other dishes were pretty large as well.\n\nIt was honestly one of the best bacon chops ever, but I found it a little toooo fatty (I had to remove the fat to prevent next-day bloating and meat sweats).\n\n+ This quail tetrazzini ($35) is absolutely heavenly! The quail was deliciously tender and the creme fraiche went perfect with it. I thought it was the best thing of the night: juicy, flavorful, melted off the bones. The garnishes also added a nice crunch to each bite. This is a MUST GET.\n\nAnd if you happen to come here with a vegetarian (not sure why you would), but this whole roasted branzino ($35)  is a great option.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nCockscomb is the kind of place where you go with friends (meat lovers). And when the food comes out, everyone stops talking. It's time to eat.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here with only my boyfriend. So we ended up sitting at the counter while drooling over everyone else's food.\n\nThe tartare and quail are MUST GETS. If you're feeling adventurous, get the roasted pigs head (they only make a certain amount and they run out every night).\n\nFor more pics and deets, visit: http://cyneats.com/cockscomb/", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the charcuterie and pin bone steak.

Stay away if you hate the sweet smokey smells of a wood fired burning oven. Run for your life  if you hate dark and rich charcuterie boards, the freshest shellfish, including oysters, crab, clams, and lobster, iodine rich and smelling of the sea. \n\nBut if you do like any of these things... Then this place is for you! \n\nEarlier this week we sat down to one glass each  of Mumms Brut Champagne & Mionetto Prosecco while we perused the straightforward yet innovative menu. The prosecco was dry and crisp, while the Mumms balanced dry with a hint of butter. \n\nWe started with a cherry tomato salad ($12), served with fresh herbs and an interesting celery vinaigrette. Light, refreshing, and bursting with summer-garden flavor, we both agreed this dish was a winner. \n\nNext up came the charcuterie ($25 for a platter $45 for a board). Dark, sweet prosciutto, terrine, and njuda, which is a spicey spreadable salami. Curiously perfectly,  good bread had been brushed with olive oil and toasted.. in advance - so by time it got to us it was cold, slightly stale and a bit tough. \n\nDuring all this, we were seated at the bar overlooking the open kitchen, a front row seat to all the action. And what action! Sous chef plunking down a 1.5 pound lobster in a saute pan for the night's special? Check. A truly gigantic lamb shoulder, bone in, being prettied up with herbs before serving in it's own all clad roaster for service? Check. Pin bone steak, cooked rare, being sliced on a board for service? Check. After spying the lobster and seeing it plated for customers, we asked, 'why don't we know about this?' Turns out our server never mentioned the night's lobster on special, you can add it to supplement a steak or bacon chop, ($65) or have it on it's own. \n\nIn the end we opted for the bacon chop with lobster side with summer corn/king trumpet mushroom succatash. Then we had to choose, the double chop or single. Seeing the portions coming outta there I knew the double could feed 4 people not 2, so we opted for the single. Good call, 'cause that single chop was humongous. Lobster served pan roasted with spices and a dipping sauce that was both spicy but low in actual heat. \n\nMoving on from our bubbles we each had a glass or two of the Pertinace Nebbiolo ($12) which pared well with the rich and abundant fare. \n\nFinishing off, we ordered a peach tart, made with a butter crust and fresh whipped cream. Impressed, the host came over with two small glasses of brandy, on the house. \n\nI can whole heartedly recommend Cockscomb, somewhat pricey but you get what you pay for 10 times over.

I cannot remember ever eating so much rich food in one sitting. It has original food, a comfortable yet upscale ambiance and it pays attention to detail. Coming with a larger group will make it a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe item everyone wants is the pigs head. Pretty amazing to see this on a menu and even more surprising to see it in person. People walking by stop and ask to take pictures of it. It is huge and incredibly fatty, we had most of ours bagged up to take home. The waiter said it goes great with eggs. The crispy ears that it comes with are amazing. I wouldn't recommend ordering this as everyone's main course, it is just too fatty, but a very fun and unique dish.\n\nBeef heart tartare was another original dish that I have never seen anyone else do. The waiter describes it as having fuller flavor, like steak tartare would have been 60 years ago before they started having hormones pumped into the meat. It was a spot on description. Full of flavor. This was my favorite dish of the night.\n\nThe duck liver terrine was incredibly strong. If you are a big liver fan you will enjoy it, but if you are at all on the fence about such things it might be a pass. It comes with some jammed fruit and thick toast to help balance it, but the ratio leaves not enough bread. Had to ask for additional slices to finish it.\n\nThe pin bone steak was huge and would have fed four people as a main entree. The cool factor in this dish was it being served with a chefs knife; very empowering. It was good, but not remarkable as far as on the bone large cuts go. It comes with some toppings which were tasty additions. The steak knives were very sleek Shun knives, which made the meat like a cloud to cut through, really excellent cutlery. \n\nThe desert was phenomenal, and was only $7. An olive oil cake with a lemon cream and br\u00fbl\u00e9ed blood oranges, which were fantastic.\n\nWine by the glass was a bit lacking in variety, only about four choices for red. There were some good reasonably priced options tho. The wine was served in Spiegelau glasses.\n\nAs with most new restaurants, the price of eating there soon after opening is dealing with some hiccups. None of them major, but for the price of the restaurant they added up. We arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table. With the larger items on the menu it is unclear how much to order and I feel our waiter made the pigs head seem like less food than it was. I've never left a restaurant with so many leftovers.  Ordered a coffee after dinner and it hadn't come by the end of desert, so we just canceled it. Also we ordered an additional side of bread to finish the terrine and they charged $1 for it. It seems petty to see a one dollar line item for bread on a $300 bill. On the plus side, there was a miscommunication on what we ordered for one of the dishes and they took it off the bill, nice touch.\n\nOverall would recommend this place out of the sheer uniqueness of the food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Instead of individual entrees we went for the Pin Bone Steak which came with roasted squash, bone marrow dip and au jus.

I can handle liver in small doses (unless fois gras), and while duck liver is a level up in decadence, they piled too much on the toast where it was just not savory.

A simply grilled cheese with duck egg and honey.  The cheese was very rich...i am not sure the blend.

The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that).

Anyway walking in, the restaurant has a warm feeling.  Maybe it's the open kitchen on a cold winter night and the big animal head that hung over head (I think it was a moose) but has a cabin like kind of feeling.  Once we checked in we were seated right away in a communal like table where they used a few jars of buddha hands to divide up the two parties.  Since my brother and I have been eyeing the menu for a bit, we knew what we wanted to order and our parents are pretty easy so we ordered uni butter with crab bruschetta, greens and herbs, little gem salad, beef heart tartare, medium shellfish platter, pin bone steak, sole, quail, and 18 layer crepe (I think it was 18).\n\nThe bruschetta was good but it was not worth $19.  I didn't taste too much crab or uni and the bread was too chewy for our liking.  The beef heart tartare was a good dish both in portion and taste.  Again the bread that came with it (since they use the same bread) was a bit too tough and chewy.  One thing I didn't appreciate was when we asked for additional bread, they charged us for it which is a bit absurd (2 slices for $1).  The two salads I thought were actually pretty tasty as it wasn't over dressed and decent in portion.  The medium shellfish platter at $48 was enough for us.  A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\nFor the entrees, I thought the quail was ridiculously over priced.  Two small pieces of meat for $35 was a rip off.  It was good but not worth $35 good.  We had a quail a few weeks ago at another place, while I don't remember the price (it was close, may be a bit less) there was definitely more meat to it.  The sold was a little bit more filling but could have used more seasoning I thought.  The main attraction, the pin bone steak was actually very generous in size.  There was more than enough for all of us but my brother and I both agreed it needed more flavor.  The beef jus that came with it was average and the bone marrow sauce was pure oil.  While I understand that eating meat on the medium rare side is generally how it's supposed to be, I would have appreciated if the waiter asked if that is okay.  \n\nOverall service was above average as they checked in on us often, made sure we had enough water.  One minor complaint is that if you have a special or something that says market price, let us know the price and don't wait for us to ask.  It's not a big deal but just something i appreciate.\n\nFor dessert the crepe had just the right amount of sweetness but it could be too much for one person as we shared it.\n\nWhy am I giving it 3.5 stars and rounding it down to three?  Overall I think the restaurant is a bit over priced.  We ended up paying $100 a person and I think at a $100 a person, we can probably do fine dining.

Right?\n\nLike NONE OTHER.\n\nI challenge you to find another high-end restaurant that puts a frickin' PIG'S HEAD right in the middle of your table.  Yes, yes, I get that Chinese restaurants have had whole pigs hanging behind glass since the beginnings of China Towns, and yes my friend Dorothy had a hugeass whole pig in her dinning room after her wedding, and Filipino yada yada yada...... no........ we're not talking barbarian style hunt and slay a pig to feed the tribe...  I am talking a nice trendy restaurant, with prices to match their high-end-ness, serving to all races of people, even the most squeamish, a PIG'S HEAD body removed...\n\nYeah?  Where?  That's right... So let's see what else we got:\n\n1. City of the Rose $13 \"Bieler rose wine, Cynar & dry vermouth\":  HORRIBLE.  Mostly tastes like cheap wine.  1/10\n\n2. Grilled Cheese $12 \"duck egg & honey\":  Another extremely disappointing serving.  Looks absolutely amateur for one.  Two sad looking pieces of stale toasts with cheese in the middle, honey dripping out like baby dribble.  Fried duck egg on top looks fine for a standard diner restaurant, for here... come on.....!  Doesn't taste much different than a chicken egg either.  2/10\n\n3. Whole Roasted Striped Bass $95 \"green bean almondine\":  So we learned the hard way that everything not served family style is probably crappy.  But they redeemed themselves with this fish!  Beautifully made, juicy, very crisp skin.  All X's crossed.  It's great.  Yes, I guess could be cooked a tad less to make the flesh even juicier, but it's still pretty good as it is.  Now get this--it's a whole fish but....... WHERE ARE THE BONES!?!?!?  Hell man, that's some kind of sick magic!  It's like a surgeon went in and removed all the bones in some mega operation, then sutured the whole thing back up!  Amazing.  Well done.  8/10\n\n4. Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Head $69 \"chicories, herbs & capers\":  Yes.  YES.  You want this.  You don't think you want this, but YOU WANT THIS.\n\nThis is probably the richest meat I've EVER had without getting that impulse to vomit.  ...(...um, maybe that doesn't sound so great... but I meant it as a good thing, really.)  The only thing I've ever had that was richer would be some Samoan food I had down in Carson--it was so extremely oily and fatty that I had to fight to keep it down after a few bites.  Really thought there would be a Samoan-style mess on the floor... after my eyes stopped tearing into the trash it all went. ...... okay okay... just saying... I've only had richer once.\n\nImagine... foie gras but instead of liver, it's face.  ...(.... okay... that didn't sound good either...)...\n\nUm, ...imagine beyond-ultra-marble Kobe beef, melting like butter just sitting on your plate, but with eyeballs on top........... oh... damn...\n\nI GIVE UP.  Trust me, you want this.  10/10\n\n5. Duck Fat Cauliflower $7 \"red fresno & mint\":  I think I was so struck with the fish and head that I totally forgot to eat this.  Seriously.  ?/10\n\n6. Latte $5:  Smooth, creamy, light.  6/10\n\n7. Fruit Bread Pudding $8:  The waiter called this a \"bread pudding.\"  Really, maybe it could technically qualify as bread pudding?  Maybe?  Pretty big stretch though.  But just think of it as a fruit-drenched cake with lots of cream, oozing with flavor.  Tastes awesome.  They could work on plating though--looks pretty amateur.  Also... I dunno, it's not really what I'd expect to have at a nicer restaurant.  Marie Calledar's perhaps.  Anyway, tastes good, but doesn't really belong here.  7/10\n\nIf you haven't been here, I urge you to.\n\nIf you call yourself a foodie, this absolutely must be on your list.\n\nAnd if you do not like this place, not that you have to enjoy everything they serve, but if you simply do not want to order every family-style dish they got...... YOU LOST YOUR FOODIE CARD.  Immediately shredded.

The meat is not so finely ground, but chunky instead, served with some very crusty bread.  I've been tempted to pick up an order of the pate to go and walk into AT&T Park with it, eating this while watching a Giants game (which would be SO San Francisco of me!).\n\nButcher's Choice:  this is usually one of the daily specials.

I made a reservation and requested a table that has the view of the open kitchen, the hostess seated us on 4 bar stools at what looks like a bar. We asked if it would be okay to get a table instead because we did not realize the chefs table would be just the bar so the hostess was nice enough to seat us at a table instead. We sat down for about 5 minutes and this older gentleman came to our table and in exact words said \"you asked for the chefs table and then asked for a regular table so I need this table back by 8pm\". First off, that was not a chefs table if you knew anything about chefs tables and second, if you are the manager of Cockscomb, god help the future of the restaurant because someone with your attitude should not be managing anything none the less a restaurant.

"], "author": "Crystal V.", "review": "With all the mixed reviews, I came here slightly hopeful--but with a somewhat of a low expectation. My dining mate and I had reservations but we came early and were able to be seated right away. We came around the beginning of dinner service so we were one of the few patrons there, however when we left, it was really crowded. The ambiance and the music was really good. Tables are really close together as most SF restaurants are so that was pretty understandable. Our server [Justin I think?] was really on point in describing the specials and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. Coming in with an idea of what we wanted-- we ordered barely any of those because of his great recommendations.\n\nOysters: For $3 each and a minimum of 1/2 a dozen, we stuck to the west coast oysters because  I generally like the smaller ones more. Nothing really stuck out about the oysters so I'd probably recommend skipping it. Its very easy to find fresh oysters in the city so you're probably better off saving room for other yummies.\n\nCrudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now. It was dressed similar to a ceviche style with nice lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos for a nice kick, and cucumbers to bring a crispness to it. A good dish, but again, not something I'd order again only because you can find this almost anywhere in the city.\n\nBeef heart tartare: YUM. Get this. I was pretty disappointed that ours didn't have a quail egg that I've seen boasted everywhere online/yelp. Ours came with a mustard-y sauce that didn't really add anything to the dish except make it easier to mix? This dish comes with two pieces of crostini/toast so my dining mate and I each got one. I went for the route where you slab a heavy layer of the beef heart tartare on and spread it then top it off with the arugula. The arugula was seasoned really salty by itself, but together with everything it was a beautiful dish. This is probably the best way to approach this dish. It comes with a helping of their seasoned potatoes which were also on point! The crispy skin was so nicely seasoned and not over powering. The potatoes were cooked just right so they still had a nice texture without being too starchy. \n\nLittle Gems: Needing some greens to go with our meal we opted for this salad with fried pig ears. I let my mate eat most of the pig ear because they weren't that special to me. I really enjoyed the salad and munched on that. The dressing was really nice and I don't know if its because I haven't allowed myself to have salad dressing in a long time, but I couldn't put my fork down! However towards the bottom of the salad it was pretty drenched making the salad lose its crisp. Maybe opt for the dressing on the side next time.\n\nGrilled Cheese with Truffles: My mate loves grilled cheese. He loves cheese, period. When looking at the menu the night before he said he was probably going to pass on this dish, but upon hearing about how it is there most popular dish, he changed his mind. I am so happy he did! It ended up being a really good dish and one of the top dishes of the night. Judging the pictures doesn't do this dish justice. The beautiful art of having the right consistency for a grilled cheese is really important. Cheese ratio-- not valid because the more the better. The toast complimented the cheese in its beautifully browned texture. The secret to this dish is not the truffles that are on top, but the honey that is used. With a taste in every bite, it was well rounded and delicious. Not overpoweringly sweet, but made a beautiful sweet symphony with the cheese. This portion of the meal was quiet due to the lovemaking of the sandwich and I. \n\nButchers Choice: Clam linguine with pork belly-- This dish was okay. I have been craving pasta for awhile so I thought this dish would help satisfy that craving. Sadly it did not. The texture of the linguine noodles were definitely different and was borderline udon noodles. The sauce was a lime citrus sauce that was really one note. I had to ask for some crush red peppers to give this baby a kick. The clams were okay and I didn't really find any pork belly. Pretty oily and would probably recommend skipping.\n\nButchers Choice: Hot mess-- YISSSSS. YES YES YES. Foie gras on top with a beef patty/croquette it seemed. My mate found the beef patty to have too much going on with a strange consistency, however when he spread the foie gras over it, turned his world upside down. Like, moment of silence, put your fork and knife down good delicious. This ritual happened after every single bite. I don't need to write much on this dish to convince you to get this because you know when theres silence at a dining table, theres magic.\n\nThough we left room for dessert, none of the options were really that impressive.

That brussellskraut STANK!  It was pretty foul smelling for me.  Took one bite and...nope, not for me.\n\nBone Marrow hay smoked fried oysters, watercress & horseradish: Kind of a standard bone marrow, they brought out our bread/toast after they dropped off our plate so we started to eat the bone marrow without it.

Service started slow but ended well with needs being met.  Chef Cosentino is the man.\n\n----\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation and were seated right away at the counter facing the kitchen.  The ambiance was dress casual, seating is pretty cozy as my elbow bumped into my neighbor on occasion during the meal.  It can be loud too so if you're looking for an intimate evening, I probably wouldn't suggest this.  That being said, it's still a good date place, or even a small group date.  We saw Chris Cosentino walking around and even got a picture with him!\n\nService - While it took a few minutes for the waiter to finally come take our order.  The service started slow but ended up being pretty good.  Our waiter was probably overworked... The attentive-ness was the good side side of the border between good and not-good.  I'd say getting the waiter's attention was along the lines of, \"I'm really starting to wonder where my waiter was\"  And just before you start to get impatient he shows up.  Once the orders went in though, things ran smooth, and the waiters and other servers made sure we were happy.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful despite the slow start.  Sitting at the counter and watching all the action in the kitchen was also a great way to wait.  We saw our food getting prepared and everything!\n\nFood - Between my date and I, we had:\nGrilled Cheese with Honey and Truffle - Cheesy, buttery, sweet. Apparently it's the thing to get at cockscomb.  I'd say it's probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had.  [But I should probably caveat that in saying... it's probably the first \"gourmet\"/fancy grilled cheese I've ever had... unless you count Kraft singles as fancy cheese]\n\nBacon Chop - Man that's one huge hunk of meat.  When I first got it, it looked normal size with some salad on the side.  But nope, brush off the salad to reveal the whole other half of the bacon chop.  The salad was good, had some thin carrot slices, parsley and some other stuff.  I suppose that \"balances\" the meal ever so slightly with me eating the 2 pounds of bacon chop.  Although I admit i \"saved\" some weight by not eating all the fat that's part of the bacon chop.  Speaking of, the taste of the chop was great with the sauce.  The chop itself was cooked right, a touch of very light pink and very juicy.  This bacon chop is why i suggest a \"small group\" date because 2 lbs of bacon chop is a lot.  \n\nButchers Choice - Pork-skin spaghetti.  So apparently you can make pasta out of pork skin.   Very good pasta actually.  I would describe it as a better tasting udon noodle.  I will say though, personal preference is for pasta sauce to be light and \"barely there\"  This was definitely not that.  But the sauce was tasty, but once we ate all the spaghetti, there was definitely a surplus of the sauce leftover.\n\nChocolate Dessert - We had the brule'd marshmallow on top of chocolate pastry brick (I don't know what to call it, it's like a brownie but way more dense) with a chocolate mousse thing on the side.  The added salt on the top was key in making the dessert great.  The brownie thing probably could have been smaller or the marshmallow could have been bigger... cuz we definitley wanted more marshmallow to go with the brownie.  Otherwise it was a good dessert, though not earth shattering.\n\nOverall - Food was different than your standard date-meal fare and new (\"avant-guard?\" is that a term i can use?)  I mean you see why Chef Cosentino is a celebrity chef.  While an initial look at the menu wasn't super impressive, once the waiter described the food, we wanted to order way more than what we could eat.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-02-08"}], "grandma rosalies tripe": [], "bone marrow": [{"excerpts": ["The steak was massive, and served with a delicious gravy and bone marrow dip.

My family and I are huge fans of a great steak dinner, and Cockscomb definitely delivered an experience beyond our expectations. \n\nWe decided to celebrate my dad's birthday on a Monday night, and the restaurant staff was very kind to have a birthday card at the table once we were seated. Once we were seated, the waiter was very friendly and eloquently told us the specials of the day. \n\nAPPETIZERS\n+ Fried squid and pig ears-- This might sound like a strange dish to try, but it was delicious! The pig ears tasted like crispy pig skin chips and the calamari was fried perfectly. I also enjoyed the addition of mint and citrus  to give the dish some brightness. \n\n+ Little Gems Salad--I ordered this salad without expecting anything too amazing (since salads are usually about the same to me), but this salad was so good! The romaine lettuce was crispy, fresh and sweet, and I loved the light vinegarette dressing. They also added fried anchovies and shredded cheese to give the entire dish some saltiness. \n\nENTREES (Shared between 4 people) \n+ Pin Bone Steak--If you're looking to treat yourself and happen to have a party of four with you, get this steak! It was honestly one of the best steaks I have ever had at any restaurant. We ordered it medium rare, and the dry aged quality of the beef definitely proved itself in this dish. The steak was massive, and served with a delicious gravy and bone marrow dip. It also came with some fresh greens and crispy potatoes\n\n+ Tuna Collar--I was skeptical about ordering this dish, since I've never been too impressed by fish collars, but I was blown away by this dish! The tuna collar was massive, and it came decked out with peppercorns, green onions, peppers, and other aromatics. It was cooked in the wood fire, and the meat was tender and fatty.  \n\nOverall, this was an amazing experience and I cannot recommend this restaurant more!

Talking to Chris who came to our table after dinner and talk about the origins of food and his desire to have Cockscomb be known as a SF Brasserie was great. It's not often you can have that type of conversation. He spent a good 10 minutes with us chatting and gave me some great restaurants to check out in my upcoming trip to Washington D.C. (You'll have to wait for my reviews to see what his favorites are there :-). \n\nChris is a fantastic and down to earth person who loves food and sharing the experience. Thanks Chris for an amazing evening.\n\nREVIEW\nWe walked in and waited at the bar ordering a great Amaretto Sour as a starter drink and had a great conversation with the bartender on gins and small distilleries (they serve some great locals such as St. George's from Alameda along with some other great local distilleries.\n\nAPPETIZER\nFor starters we ordered the special for tonight called \"Hot Mess\". This was a plate of seared fois gras and pig trotters set in a wonderful sweet berry sauce that offset the richness of the dish.\n5 stars\n\nNext was the Grilled Cheese with honey drizzle and fried duck egg with a wonderfully creamy yolk that I popped and poured over the dish. I then flipped over the white to cover the top and cut it up in bite size pieces for the table. The cheeses were oozing out of the bread like a river of cheese working it's way around the bread on the plate. This is a do not miss dish if you like GC and want it with a twist.\n5 stars\n\nMAIN COURSE 1\nDuck, served with the most amazing grilled squash. This is not the typical green squash squash bit rather various types with mottled skin that tasted very much like sweet potato and regular potatos perfectly seasoned with just enough salt to mix with the sweetness of the squash. I was surprised how good squash can be if care is given to think about cooking it differently such as tonight.\n\nThe duck skin was crispy and the amount of duck meat was surprisingly large. This feeds 4 easily.  The duck meat was tender, we'll seasoned and set on top of some duck au ju.\n5 stars\n\nMAIN COURSE 2\nPin Steak serverd with bone marrow sauce! Oh yes you heard it right. This is a massive sirloin with bone, cooked and served from rare to med rare so everyone was happy. The meat itself was fantastically seasoned and could stand on its own.  However, after you pour the bone marrow sauce on it and take a bite you want to yell \" THIS IS AWESOME!\".\n\nI have eaten tons of steak and a lot of bone marrow in my travels but bone marrow sauce poured on your steak? Yes it is WOW.\n5 Stars\n\nSIDE DISH\nDirty Potatoes which are slightly fried potato whole and pieces lightly salted with creme fraiche and sweet hot red peppers. The peppers add some nice flavor and slight heat to the potatoes to really give you something different than your usual potato dish. Crispy outside and a nice soft center made this a great starch to go along with the meat.\n5 stars\n\nDESSERT 1\nChocolate flourless cake with pistachio crumbles and chocolate ganache. A very rich and semi sweet cake that was excellent. Smooth as silk, and topped with a scoop of caramel ice cream, this dish was done in 30 seconds by the 4 of us.\n5 Stars\n\nDESSERT 2\nLemon olive oil cake with fresh citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges). This was very refreshing and light.  The olive oil cake was perfect, great smooth texture, and extremely moist. The citrus juices soaked into the cake for a mouthful of flavors. If you want to go light in dessert this is a great option.\n5 Stars\n\nCappuccino and Americanos were great. A nice layer of very thick and creamy foam topped our cappuccinos and the espresso was excellent.\n\nTIP: We came for the pigs head but they were out. Chris told me you have to come early (we had 8:30pm reservations) or call ahead and let them know you want one as it varies as to how many heads he can get daily. \n\nI will definitely be back to order the bacon chop and pigs head to finish off the large main meat dishes on the menu.\n\nAn amazing evening and incredibly well prepared food.

Why?  Because I love meat and the San Francisco Giants.  Both are expensive habits, so I try to ration my visits accordingly (but probably unsuccessfully).  So far, I've limited myself to special occasions to dine here (my wedding anniversary, the wedding anniversary for some friends, and to entertain out-of-town visitors).  \n\nFirst tip:  come hungry.  The portions are fairly big, but you want to try a bunch of different items.\nSecond tip:  make a dinner reservation, even during the week.  This place always seems full, even on random Wednesday nights.  Chef Cosentino is a big name in the culinary world, so plenty of tourists flock here.\nThird tip:  if you are looking for the \"Impossible burger,\" it's only served at lunch.  No dinner options for this popular (and curious) meal.\nFourth tip:  even though meat is the big draw here, leave some room for dessert.  After all the savory flavors, some sweet treats at the end of the meal are always welcome.\n\nSince the menu always changes, I will just highlight some of my most memorable dishes:\n\nPin bone steak:  one of the few non-rotating choices, it's listed under the \"Shared Suppers\" section.  And they are not kidding.  I've ordered this for parties of 4, and all 4 people need to be pretty hungry (and love beef) to finish this.  Served with a bone marrow dip, the steak is luxurious and food-coma inducing.  \n\nWood oven roasted pigs head:  always a head turner, this \"Shared Supper\" (also a menu staple) is not for the faint of heart.  The head of any animal is underrated by diners, with some of the most tender and flavorful meat inside the cheeks and neck of a beast.  The pig's head is no exception.  The skin was crispy from the oven-roasting and the meat among the most tasty I've ever had.  In addition, the dish is served with 2 different sauces on the side, both made from the pork \"drippings.\"  My wife & I shared this at one meal, but we had a difficult time sleeping that night, since that meal was so heavy.  You have been warned.\n\nCountry pate:  Sometimes this is offered by itself, other times as part of the charcuterie platter.  But it's the best pate I've ever had.  The meat is not so finely ground, but chunky instead, served with some very crusty bread.  I've been tempted to pick up an order of the pate to go and walk into AT&T Park with it, eating this while watching a Giants game (which would be SO San Francisco of me!).\n\nButcher's Choice:  this is usually one of the daily specials.  My favorite so far has been an order of cow udder, served with escargot.  I've never seen cow udder on any menu, but I plan to get an order every time it's available.

We blanketed it with the bone marrow dip it came with. \n\nAccording to the reviews I've read, you may want to skip the wood oven roasted pig's head because it's supposedly unpalatably fatty and chewy. If you fellow chocolate enthusiasts are still up for it, after all the entrees and starters, then order the Mexican Chocolate Cake w/ pumpkin. This was so thick and rich---not overwhelmingly sweet. Great drink menu and accommodating service as well. \n\n+ Chef Chris Cosentino is a sweetheart", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-01-29"}, {"excerpts": ["I went for the Ribeye with Bone Marrow & Spinach, and at last the steak delivered the goods in its tender preparation and meltably good texture ", "(photo: http://bit.ly/1ZwtnFZ). ", "Strangely I would have thought the bone marrow would mean toast wedges would be forthcoming upon which to spread the marrow. "], "author": "Ed U.", "review": "I had such high expectations of dining nirvana here but it was just not meant to be. I remember enjoying Incanto's head-to-tail dinner during Chris Cosentino's early days as its chef. I had not tried his latest venture before New Year's Eve when they were offering a special $110 four-course prix fixe dinner. Surely this was an optional choice. No, it wasn't. Since I made the reservation just two days in advance, I was left a message that there was a no-cancellation policy and that the prix fixe menu was mandatory. It struck me as rather restrictive, a reason to give me a case of pre-meat sweats. Would Cosentino's chops be worth it?\n\nNow understand that since I tried Incanto over a dozen years ago, Cosentino has become a celebrity chef as he became a constant presence on the Food Network and the ultimate anointment, a friend of Anthony Bourdain when he came to town looking for local eats. So when Jamie W. and I entered the restaurant, the former Zuppa, we saw his staff hovering around him like acolytes near the grill oven (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYZAG7). We were squeezed against a banquette right next to a trio of obnoxious twenty-something hipster wannabes bellowed their conversation like it was a decibel-challenged nightclub. Cocktails were needed immediately.\n\nJamie ordered the $11 Pisco Punch, a sweet Peruvian elixir with pineapple and nutmeg added to the mix (photo: http://bit.ly/1V27tcD). I went for the more clubby $12 Boothby, a blend of cranberry juice, Douglas Fir bourbon, sweet vermouth, bitters and sparkling wine (photo: http://bit.ly/1NguYZG). It was almost enough to distract me from the 'dude'-laden dialogue inches away from us. For the first course, Jamie tried the Parsnip & Smoked Haddock Chowder, a buttery-salty blend that was indeed velvety good and gone all too soon (photo: http://bit.ly/1n6TzLa). I went for what I presume to be a Cosentino specialty, the Foie Gras Torchon with Cranberries & Brioche (photo: http://bit.ly/1PbtRC1).\n\nExcept for the sweetness of the cranberries, I found the foie gras quite bland and not lusciously addictive. The second course brought salads. Jamie tried the Castel Franco & Ricotta Salata with Olives (photo: http://bit.ly/1PlTeL7). Castel Franco is a mild form of bitter radicchio that was overwhelmed by the amount of ricotta shavings on the plate. Mine was the other choice, the Butter Lettuce with Hazelnuts & Blood Orange (photo: http://bit.ly/1PlTcmq). It tasted like a standard steakhouse salad, inoffensive and tasty enough but nothing more really. The entrees came next, and we knew this was the make-or-break point of our evening since Cosentino, by all accounts, knows his meats.\n\nJamie ordered the Pork Belly, Clams & Buddha's Hand Citron Salsa (photo: http://bit.ly/1OsmYZr), an odd surf-&-turf combo that just didn't quite mesh despite the richness of the belly. The citrus flavor of the salsa added another idiosyncratic note that made Jamie's shoulders shrug in indifference. I went for the Ribeye with Bone Marrow & Spinach, and at last the steak delivered the goods in its tender preparation and meltably good texture (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZwtnFZ). Strangely I would have thought the bone marrow would mean toast wedges would be forthcoming upon which to spread the marrow. When I inquired about this, I received a puzzled look of acceptance and then about ten minutes of radio silence.\n\nWhen he did come with the grilled bread, I was done with the marrow and rather perturbed to find my request added to the bill later for $2. I just think for a restaurant at this exorbitant price point, a simple piece of bread could have been made complementary. Oh well. We moved to our final course, the dessert, and they were reasonably satisfying treats. Jamie had the Chocolate Cremeux & Golden Marshmallows, a mousse-like creation with its sole marshmallow given a bit of gold leaf (photo: http://bit.ly/1OB6GeK). I went with the Baked Apple with Gorgonzola & Honeycomb (photo: http://bit.ly/1PBxsDH). It was just half a small apple given the peasant treatment, but it was enough.\n\nNearly $300 later, we felt somewhat disappointed. It was less about the quality of the food which we didn't question but rather the indifferent manner which was pervasive throughout what should have been a more festive evening. The restaurant never did crowd up while we were there, and while we didn't expect Cosentino to stop by, it would have been a nice gesture. However, I could say the same about the staff overall since we didn't feel much warmth though it was clearly thrown at other diners around us. Alas, maybe we'll try the regular menu sometime as the burger looked like a good deal, but frankly we're in no hurry.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...considering Cosentino's reputation, marginally disappointing especially given the price point\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...doesn't look much different than Zuppa but that's fine\nSERVICE - 3 stars...didn't feel the love\nTOTAL - 3 stars...it should be more than the meat, right?", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["This dish came with two sauces: bone marrow sauce and red wine sauce.

Thanks for the excellent food!\n\nCame here for a birthday dinner on Saturday night. We had a reservation for 5 and I was the first to arrive 15 mins early, but our table was already ready and after I was brought there, the staff showed me where the bar was and suggested I could either hangout at the bar and waited at the table. Very thoughtful service!\n\nIt's not a big menu but all the dishes names sound very tempting. And since it is so hard to decide.... we just went ahead with the \"Shared Supper\" items and got both of them plus two other appetizers.\n\n#Beef Heart Tartare - Appetizers ($16): A.\nBeef tartare is pretty common but beef heart? It turned out to be pretty delicious. The meat definitely contained a lot more fat, and the texture was more smooth than regular beef tartare. I actually almost felt like eating fatty tuna tartare. Used it as a spread on grilled bread. Wonderful.\n\n#Octopus A La Plancha - Appetizers ($18): B.\nNot sure about this one. Portion was very small, and there were only few pieces of octopus plus some vegetables. Not recommended.\n\n#Pin Bone Steak - Shared Supper ($110): A+.\nFirst off, the price did justify at least from the portion point of view - this dish alone could have fed 6 people. And the steak itself was bomb! Very, very nicely cooked. Even though the bone size was enormous, every piece of meat I tasted was almost at the same level of rawness (borderline of rare and medium rare). Very juicy, very tender. This dish came with two sauces: bone marrow sauce and red wine sauce. Honestly I could not taste much from the bone marrow sauce, probably the flavor from bone marrow was sort of on the light side. But the red wine sauce was definitely worth to be put on the steak. Some vege that came with this dish definitely helped balanced my stomach a little bit.\n\n#Wood Oven Roasted Pig Head - Shared Supper ($65): A+.\nThis dish alone could have fed another 4 people! What a big head. For anyone that has tried Chinese style roasted pig before this dish actually reminded me exactly that. The skin was crispy (not brittle enough to a point that it would break once you bite on it though) but the meat / fat underneath was WOW. It was actually a huge amount of fat. If it was not cooked properly it would actually feel pretty nasty to put so much fat in your mouth at the same time. Nothing like that from this dish. Very flavorful and the temperature was just about right. The meat tasted like moist pulled pork with lots of flavor too.\n\nSome other notes:\n- Cocktails were great. We tried \"The Towering Inferno\" (gin and ginger beer based) and \"About Cherry Sling\" (gin and cherry based) and both were very refreshing, not too strong and tasted very fruity.\n- Service was wonderful. Our server was wonderful and very attentive, and very energetic when explaining the menu to us. The cocktails above were actually suggested by him, he surely knows what's good there.\n- At the end of our dinner Chef Chris Cosentino walked out from the kitchen, sat down at our table chatted with us for quite a bit of time! He explained his philosophy of this restaurant, his goal about customer experience, what new dish he is working on etc. A very nice and passionate chef. We got to take a picture with him too!\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience with amazing food. I may not be coming back too often because the dishes were just too meaty but if I can manage to gather a big group of friends from out of town, Cockscomb will definitely be the few on top of my list for dinner gathering.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Pine Bone Steak with Bone Marrow Dip!

Well you can, I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't the Truffle Grilled cheese I saw in pics on yelp, but I guess its not truffle season. Never the less, excellent grilled cheese.  The next dish was the pig ears and cabbage salad.  Similar to a Vietnamese salad dish, it was a bit tangy and spicy.  However, I probably would have enjoyed the pig ears by themselves, without all the cabbage and dressing.\n\nAfter wetting our appetites, we continued on to the heavier plates.  The beef heart tartare was delicious, but not for the faint of heart...  BEEFY is the best way to describe the flavor and the bread was perfectly grilled and buttered!  SO GOOD!  The butcher's choice was lamb heart with yellow zucchini.  It was well seasoned and cooked, but it just wasn't my thing.\n\nThe main event featured the heavy weight of the heavy weights!

Wines by the bottle were $40-$120.\n*Classic Gin & Tonic ($12): http://bit.ly/1yuRvh6\n*Chef's Gin Jam ($11): http://bit.ly/1yaFdwL\n*Big Trouble in Little China ($11): http://bit.ly/12jWzZM\n\nMy fav was the Chef's Gin with housemade strawberry jam; nicely sweet, tart, and refreshing.\n\nA P P E T I Z E R S \n*Little Gem Salad w/ green goddess dressing & crispy pig ears ($11): http://bit.ly/1tDTmuH\n*Grilled Cheese w/ shaved black truffles & honey ($16): http://bit.ly/1vJxRNh\n*Eggsx3 w/ trout roe & tarragon aioli ($14): http://bit.ly/12eQVsN; yolk porn: http://bit.ly/1wcejnf\n*Beef Heart Tartare w/ grilled bread & fries ($16): http://bit.ly/1FHB2Y8\n*Bone Marrow Mixed Grill w/ watercress & horseradish ($20): http://bit.ly/1FJ35IC\n*Uni Bruschetta w/ Iberico lardo ($18): http://bit.ly/1yBGnA3\n\nAll the apps we ordered were excellent. The little gem salad which was nicely dressed and had a great porky crunch from the pig ears (I wish there was more of it though). The grilled cheese could have had more cheese but the shaved black truffles added a great luxurious earthiness. If you like oozy yolk porn, the eggx3 is a must order!\n\nThe beef heart tartare was one hearty dish (great for sharing) especially with the deliciously crispy fried potatoes. The trio of bone marrow was slightly disappointing as we found it hard to dig out marrow from the other non-beef bones. The pairing of uni (sweetly briny) and iberico lardo (pork buttah) was pure ambrosia but would have been better with a less carby bread and sans the radish and greens.\n\nE N T R E E S\n*Bacon Chop w/ apples, brussellskraut, mustard ($32): http://bit.ly/12jWDJ4\n*Bavette Steak w/ roasted carrots & kombu butter ($33): http://bit.ly/1v4pFmX\n* Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head w/ endive salad & salsa verde dripping sauce ($50): http://bit.ly/1CygR2B; pig ear: http://bit.ly/1tv8zz8\n\nThe bacon chop is a must order for carniwhores! It's 2 lbs of succulent, meaty deliciousness. There's a thick layer of fat lining the chop which keeps it incredibly moist. The bavette steak was uber tender and had a subtle umami flavor from the kombu butter. The pig's head was a wondrous sight that would make most carniwhores cream...and vegetarians scream. I expected it to be uber crunchy like Chinese siu yuk or Filipino lechon but the skin was fatty and gelatinous. To get into the prized cuts of meat like the cheek, you'll have to pry through the thick layers of fat. We barely made a dent into it so I have the leftovers (carcass and all) in the freezer to make pozole at a later time. The leftover salsa verde made with the pig's drippings makes for a great crusty bread dipper. \n\nD E S S E R T\n*\"Classic\" Mandarin Orange Mille Crepe Cake ($7): http://bit.ly/1pH6wvE\n It was too soggy and wet for my liking. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nYou would have never known it was their soft opening because the staff was spectacular! From the hostess, waiters (Josh and David), busboys, and floor managers, everyone was so welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable (of the menu). Chris Cosentino even made his rounds around the dining room chatting with customers. Food service was also very timely. Best soft opening/grand opening that I've been to in 2014!\n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nDark and contemporary with concrete walls, dark furnishings, and Edison bulb lighting. In the main dining room there's 5 two tops, 3 four tops, 1 communal table and 12 counter seats in front of the open kitchen. Additional tables and the second bar is in the mezzanine level.

A thin, tall and erect man in a dark sports jacket and stripe shirt, with dark jeans to complete the mandatory SoMa biz look was waiting outside of the restaurant. The last sentence I said out loud was \"banana bread and pot brownies.\" Just a lovely way to impress the man in a dark sports coat. I bumped into him on purpose for I lacked the usual grace. He informed me there seemed to be a lot of Asians who just walked in. Our reservation was for 6:45. The maitre de led us to a counter space facing the kitchen. We both said, \"Dining at the counter was my favorite\" and then caught ourselves agreeing about something unintentionally. He scooped my stool closer to him so that we could find a suitable distance to discuss the comings and goings. \n\nCockscomb has been my secret obsession ever since it showed up in an Urbandaddy review. Any friend of mine who dined with me recently would know that I could not shut up about it. It was only a matter of time I'd come here. After canceling the prior two reservations, we made it finally. \n\nI noted a man I knew was sitting two stools down, I did not greet him for I was lazy. We caught up on our lives. His cousins were in town. He's headed to New England for a trip before New Years, and his father's 90th birthday was coming up and his flight to his Midwestern town required a mandatory stop over in Chicago. I asked about the timing for I had always wanted to check off several midwestern states that I had never been to and never intended to go: Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, the Dakotas.  You know, the bucket list that says \"Those midwestern states you swear that you'd never set foot in but you did anyway.\"  He laughed and invited me to a future trip on that account. \n\nHaving accomplished that, I started to review menu. Really good selection of odd yet familiar items. The bone marrow three way, the spicy tripe, the little gem with fried pig ears. The entire pig's head. The steak that is big enough to share with the entire village. Difficult choices but I all of sudden realize why so many Asians. We love that shit. The strangely familiar items on the menu spoke to Asians. The strange sounding comfort food that you'd see served in a different way in a Chinese restaurant, The ingredients that made some cringe and others jump up and down for joy. I'm the other. \n\nWe had a few things but I was not hungry as I should. The man to the left of me, the one I recognized but failed to say hello to earlier, was sharing a two pound pork chop with his lady friend, who could not have been his wife, so I wondered. The man to the right of me, the companion who was waiting for me outside earlier, was impressed by the tripe, but not so impressed with the aged ham. He claimed that back in his home town they knew how to really do the hog right. I reserve the right to get smarter and will hold him to it. \n\nYou don't need to be a Asian American person who grew up on pig's head or an Iowa Irish pig farm boy to appreciate the unusual combination of other worldly goodies Cockscomb cooks up.  It is a new age comfort food concept done right.\n\nI have a a few more friends that I'm anxious to drag into this scene. I'm also just plain juvenile.

Service is pretty good but I felt a little rush when waitstaff kept coming by wanting to take your plate away when you are still \"nibbling\" away. And most importantly, THE FOOD, was pretty good.

Yeah don't come here.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nAh, this is an hard review to have to write. I was definitely on the hype train for Cockscomb, given all the great things that I'd heard from friends about it. We came as a group of six, and, unfortunately, had to limit our pork options since one person in our party didn't eat it, leading to orders of the:\n\n* Squid... something - Probably the tastiest dish of the night, which is unfortunate because there were six of us, and one of this little appetizer/side. And, yet, oddly, none of us remember exactly what it was we ordered: I'm inclined to think it was a pasta dish, but don't quote me on that.\n\n* Pig Skin Noodles - My hearing must not be what it once was, because I completely misheard/understood how this dish was prepared, after asking our waiter, thinking it was pig skin inside a noodle dish. But nope, the noodles themselves are actually made from pig skin :o Tasty, and, as you'd expect, incredibly rich and fatty. The texture of the \"noodles\" is, well, chewy and squishy, so prepare yourselves.\n\n* Pin Bone Steak - So, this was the centerpiece. Some tables went with the pig head, some with this, and others with both. Given the aforementioned pork limiter, we opted for the steak, and... any disappointment I had lay almost entirely in this dish. Yes, the quality of the meat was quite good, but our medium rare steak ended up coming out more as a rare steak, and one that seemed unseasoned, almost. I'm not usually one to complain about bland food, since I eat lighter than most, but EVERYONE in our group thought this was bland, even with the provided jus and bone marrow dip. It was bland enough that we had to bust out the salt shaker, which I haven't done since... 15 years ago?\n\n* Panna Cotta - Not something I usually order because, well, I'm lactose intolerant, but that I've somehow probably had more of than any other fancier dessert. And theirs was QUITE delicious, creamy, and rich.\n\nSide dishes aren't enough to save a restaurant, and, while I rarely given two star first experiences a second chance, there's a good chance I will with Cockscomb, since my friends insisted that this was probably a one off fluke. So, until then, 2.5 stars for the place.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak for the main floor of the restaurant, but they do have an elevator that goes up to the second floor, where I'm guessing the larger parties are seated.

My friend and I are huge truffle fans so we could not resist the grilled cheese with shaved truffle on top (yes, please, the truffle was such a nice sweet balance against the cheese) and of course, as soon as the waiter said, \"Now I know you know that foie gras is now available again in Calfornia....\" My friend and I eagerly asked, \"Do you have any??\"  He said, \" Yes, we have a....\"  \"We'll take it!!\"  Do you think we have been deprived?  I say yes.  Haha, when the foie gras arrived, I cut myself a piece trying not to be too greedy because I was sharing the dish with two other people....mmm, I closed my eyes and savored its flavor.  I know it's a controversial dish and it is not completely ethical but I just can't help myself.  Why does it have to be so good?  \n\nAnyway I digress - we also ordered the pig skin spaghetti (my friend didn't care for the sauce, a little to salty?, I didn't mind at all, I thought it was tasty) and the bone marrow (creamy smooth, yummy).  All of the above so far was tasty but not necessarily all good for the heart so we also ordered some sauteed chard - that was a good balance (well, let's just say it was).  \n\nFor dessert, we had cheese with honey and walnuts and a layered crepe cake with fruit.

I might order it.\n\nNow moving onto the food, here's what we had:\n\n+ Beef heart tartare is unlike anything I've ever had ($16). It comes with a helping of arugula and seasoned potatoes which were so on point! The quality of the meat was super fresh and it got me really excited for everything else to come. It's probably one of the best appetizers on the menu.\n\n+ Crudo of the day ($16) was dressed similar to a ceviche style, using lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos were added for a nice kick, and cucumbers brought a crispness to each bite.\n\n+ OMG this bacon chop ($32). Ok, so.....this thing is huge! Every bite was super tender and it's perfectly grilled and juicy on the inside. We couldn't finish half of it since the other dishes were pretty large as well.\n\nIt was honestly one of the best bacon chops ever, but I found it a little toooo fatty (I had to remove the fat to prevent next-day bloating and meat sweats).\n\n+ This quail tetrazzini ($35) is absolutely heavenly! The quail was deliciously tender and the creme fraiche went perfect with it. I thought it was the best thing of the night: juicy, flavorful, melted off the bones. The garnishes also added a nice crunch to each bite. This is a MUST GET.\n\nAnd if you happen to come here with a vegetarian (not sure why you would), but this whole roasted branzino ($35)  is a great option.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nCockscomb is the kind of place where you go with friends (meat lovers). And when the food comes out, everyone stops talking. It's time to eat.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here with only my boyfriend. So we ended up sitting at the counter while drooling over everyone else's food.\n\nThe tartare and quail are MUST GETS. If you're feeling adventurous, get the roasted pigs head (they only make a certain amount and they run out every night).\n\nFor more pics and deets, visit: http://cyneats.com/cockscomb/", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Instead of individual entrees we went for the Pin Bone Steak which came with roasted squash, bone marrow dip and au jus.

Although they have some good veggie dishes but you are here for the meat and seafood. We (4) came here on a busy Sat evening, place is packed by 6pm and it is pretty loud. Very cool setting and you can see the chef working hard with his kitchen staff to prepare that delicious meal for you. \n\nWe started with cherrystone clams from WA, pretty good, very sweet, followed by the special of that night, which is fore gars, the fg itself is pretty small, buried under some shredded pork, not too bad. Then comes the beef heart tartare,I am not sure if this dish is really raw beef heart but it tastes great! it goes really well with the grilled bread. after that we had the bone marrow, I am not a big fan of it but my friends really enjoyed it. \n\nThen the waiter clear the table and about 20 min wait, comes the roasted pig head, they say it is for 2 to 3 people to share but we had plenty of left overs after we were done with it. I think maybe I was expecting a lot, since this is kind of like their signature dish, but sadly I only took couple bites of the skin and meat then that was it for me, any more I would throw up. I guess it is the greasiness...The skin was not that crispy, and it kinda stick to your teeth, for me I had to scrape off the fat attached to the skin, otherwise I don't think i can eat it. The other part is that you have to dig through all the fat under the skin in order to get to some lean meat and the digging part is kinda of... I don't know, it is just not for me. The dish came with some dipping sauce, it is pig's brain mixed with mayonnaise or they called it brainaise, not a big fan of it. There is also some sauce that dripped off the pig's head when roasting it, the chef mix it with some herbs which you can dip the skin or meat with it, again not a big fan of it. To be honest I wish the chef used the hoisin sauce as one of the dipping sauce, it would take some of the greasiness away... just a suggestion. The pig's ear that came with it was deep fried a bit, therefor very crispy and I like it a lot.\n\nAlmost all the meat dishes come with some good portion of veggies. My wife had the little gem salad and it was pretty good. She also had the quail with mushroom (she was not too fond of the pig's head), and she loved it, I tried it too and I would choose the quail over pig's head. \n\nI think I will be back couple more times just to try other dishes on the menu.

Service was impeccable but a tad impersonal...borderline cold.  We ordered:\n\n1.  duck liver on toast: 2/5.  I can handle liver in small doses (unless fois gras), and while duck liver is a level up in decadence, they piled too much on the toast where it was just not savory.  The bread was delicious, however, the amount of liver just overpowered it.  We had to ask for extra toast to divvy up the liver.  \n\n2.  grilled cheese: 4.5/5  This was the best dish of the night.  A simply grilled cheese with duck egg and honey.  The cheese was very rich...i am not sure the blend.  A duck egg topped it off.  $11 for a grilled cheese is pretty redick in its own, and while this sandwich was good, it wasn't heavenly by any means.  The honey was a nice touch.  \n\n3.  pin bone steak: 3/5  This is what I came here for, and in terms of presentation, it did not disappoint.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and the bone marrow dip and au jus were ono grindz to the extreme.  However, beyond the presentation, the meat was a little too chewy.  Pin bone cuts are the most succulent of the sirloin steaks, however, this dish did not meet that billing.  I left Cockscomb -$110 for this steak as well as a jawache.  \n\nWe got some other dishes like halibut and some desserts.  To me, the dessert did not even qualify as a dessert.

"], "author": "Pierre L.", "review": "3.5 stars\n\nMy brother, a fan of chef Constentino and of eating odd things wanted to try this place and since I knew he was going to be free, we made the reservation to give it a try.  \n\nThe restaurant is located on 4th street, across the street from the Well Fargo.  Anyway walking in, the restaurant has a warm feeling.  Maybe it's the open kitchen on a cold winter night and the big animal head that hung over head (I think it was a moose) but has a cabin like kind of feeling.  Once we checked in we were seated right away in a communal like table where they used a few jars of buddha hands to divide up the two parties.  Since my brother and I have been eyeing the menu for a bit, we knew what we wanted to order and our parents are pretty easy so we ordered uni butter with crab bruschetta, greens and herbs, little gem salad, beef heart tartare, medium shellfish platter, pin bone steak, sole, quail, and 18 layer crepe (I think it was 18).\n\nThe bruschetta was good but it was not worth $19.  I didn't taste too much crab or uni and the bread was too chewy for our liking.  The beef heart tartare was a good dish both in portion and taste.  Again the bread that came with it (since they use the same bread) was a bit too tough and chewy.  One thing I didn't appreciate was when we asked for additional bread, they charged us for it which is a bit absurd (2 slices for $1).  The two salads I thought were actually pretty tasty as it wasn't over dressed and decent in portion.  The medium shellfish platter at $48 was enough for us.  A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\nFor the entrees, I thought the quail was ridiculously over priced.  Two small pieces of meat for $35 was a rip off.  It was good but not worth $35 good.  We had a quail a few weeks ago at another place, while I don't remember the price (it was close, may be a bit less) there was definitely more meat to it.  The sold was a little bit more filling but could have used more seasoning I thought.  The main attraction, the pin bone steak was actually very generous in size.  There was more than enough for all of us but my brother and I both agreed it needed more flavor.  The beef jus that came with it was average and the bone marrow sauce was pure oil.  While I understand that eating meat on the medium rare side is generally how it's supposed to be, I would have appreciated if the waiter asked if that is okay.  \n\nOverall service was above average as they checked in on us often, made sure we had enough water.  One minor complaint is that if you have a special or something that says market price, let us know the price and don't wait for us to ask.  It's not a big deal but just something i appreciate.\n\nFor dessert the crepe had just the right amount of sweetness but it could be too much for one person as we shared it.\n\nWhy am I giving it 3.5 stars and rounding it down to three?  Overall I think the restaurant is a bit over priced.  We ended up paying $100 a person and I think at a $100 a person, we can probably do fine dining.  I did like this place better than Incanto (chef's last place) and I wouldn't mind giving it another try.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the beef heart tartare and bone marrow.

It's sooo good and I feel like you'd have to be totally insane to NOT find something amazing on the menu that you're dying to order.\n\nI'm kicking myself for not ordering oysters, first of all. It's the very first thing on their menu and they specialize in fresh beautiful seafood. Ah, well. Next time. I was still blissfully happy with what we did enjoy. We chose a bunch of sides (\"daily requirements\") to start with. Gnocchi with sage & brown butter, mushrooms \"a la greque\" with garlic, lemon, and parsley, \"dirty\" crispy potatoes, and duck fat cauliflower with chili, garlic, and mint. Being gluten free I avoided anything with gluten (duh) or anything fried, since they use one fryer for all things fried. But most of the menu was available to me! I loooooved the mushrooms which were so rich and just lemony enough, and the cauliflower was nuts. Why don't I use fresh mint more often in my daily life? It took the cauliflower to another level and I could not get enough.\n\nFor my entree I had the \"Local Fish\" dish, and I seriously ate every bite. That's a huge deal for me -- I tend to leave half of my meal for take-home leftovers. But this was just too good... The catch of the day was halibut, and it was incredibly fresh and salt-watery without being fishy at all. So flaky and soft and moist. It's served with \"gigantic beans,\" which were hearty and rustic and gorgeous, plus marinated mussels. YUM. I got some shellfish in there! The best part was the skin of the fish... it was coated in fennel and pan-fried, so I had this perfect, crispy, aromatic skin that made every bite way better. I get a little weird about fennel sometimes because I'm not a huge fan of licorice-y flavors, but this application didn't make me think of candy... it was mild and bright and just right. \n\nFor dessert we all shared the panna cotta. I'm not a big dessert person (I always choose savory over sweet), but you guys.... this panna cotta was INSANE. I feel like I'm being so over-dramatic in this review, but honestly... I can't get over how rad every single aspect of our entire meal was. Service included.

For myself and a few of my adventurous eater friends, this restaurant was an absolute pleasure to dine at.\n\nSome of the things we ordered:\n- Crispy squid & pig ears: One of my favorite appetizers...possibly ever. The pig ear was so delightfully crispy and perfectly seasoned, and the squid wasn't tough in the slightest. The citrus, mint, and chili was a really beautiful compliment to everything.\n\n- Beef heart tartare: Enjoyed the tartare, but wasn't a fan of the grilled bread, which is probably my only negative criticism of the meal. The slices of grilled bread were just too big and just overpowered the taste of the tartare.\n\n- \"Hot Mess\" off-menu special: I wish I remembered the full details of this, but all I can recall is that it involved foie gras. Yum. It was delicious and rich as you'd expect. My only wish was that we ate it faster because it got cold fairly quickly.\n\n- Carrots with lebne + duck fat cauliflower: Great little sides that provided some fiber to a very carnivorous meal.\n\n- Roasted pigs head: A HUGE highlight of the dinner. It felt so primal seeing that entire half pigs head, eyeball and all, and then digging into it with our knives and forks. The skin was to die for - Amazingly crispy, crunchy, & savory. The meat was so tender that once you ate the skin, all the meat underneath just fell apart with a slight touch of the fork, and every part from the eye to the cheek tasted deliciously savory, rich, and all around just perfect. A bonus - A brain aioli dipping sauce for all of the skin and meat. Honestly this was one of the most decadent and most pleasurable eating experiences of my life. I took some of the leftover meat home and made fried rice with it the next day (highly recommend)\n\nOn top of all of this, service was fantastic, and our server was very attentive and friendly.\n\nI absolutely plan to go back to try some of their other unique meat-centric dishes like the whole duck or meat pie.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-03-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I also really enjoyed the duck fat cauliflower (very tender and juicy!).

It was quite a menu and he described each dish with a full description which at the end of the specials was a bit overwhelming.

The main dish was VERY tasty.  I thought the scallops were divine!  The turnips were not the hit of the dish, but when they are competing with beef and scallops, who would expect them to be?  The salad was great because it was light and the peaches were sweet.  I also really enjoyed the duck fat cauliflower (very tender and juicy!).

Right?\n\nLike NONE OTHER.\n\nI challenge you to find another high-end restaurant that puts a frickin' PIG'S HEAD right in the middle of your table.  Yes, yes, I get that Chinese restaurants have had whole pigs hanging behind glass since the beginnings of China Towns, and yes my friend Dorothy had a hugeass whole pig in her dinning room after her wedding, and Filipino yada yada yada...... no........ we're not talking barbarian style hunt and slay a pig to feed the tribe...  I am talking a nice trendy restaurant, with prices to match their high-end-ness, serving to all races of people, even the most squeamish, a PIG'S HEAD body removed...\n\nYeah?  Where?  That's right... So let's see what else we got:\n\n1. City of the Rose $13 \"Bieler rose wine, Cynar & dry vermouth\":  HORRIBLE.  Mostly tastes like cheap wine.  1/10\n\n2. Grilled Cheese $12 \"duck egg & honey\":  Another extremely disappointing serving.  Looks absolutely amateur for one.  Two sad looking pieces of stale toasts with cheese in the middle, honey dripping out like baby dribble.  Fried duck egg on top looks fine for a standard diner restaurant, for here... come on.....!  Doesn't taste much different than a chicken egg either.  2/10\n\n3. Whole Roasted Striped Bass $95 \"green bean almondine\":  So we learned the hard way that everything not served family style is probably crappy.  But they redeemed themselves with this fish!  Beautifully made, juicy, very crisp skin.  All X's crossed.  It's great.  Yes, I guess could be cooked a tad less to make the flesh even juicier, but it's still pretty good as it is.  Now get this--it's a whole fish but....... WHERE ARE THE BONES!?!?!?  Hell man, that's some kind of sick magic!  It's like a surgeon went in and removed all the bones in some mega operation, then sutured the whole thing back up!  Amazing.  Well done.  8/10\n\n4. Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Head $69 \"chicories, herbs & capers\":  Yes.  YES.  You want this.  You don't think you want this, but YOU WANT THIS.\n\nThis is probably the richest meat I've EVER had without getting that impulse to vomit.  ...(...um, maybe that doesn't sound so great... but I meant it as a good thing, really.)  The only thing I've ever had that was richer would be some Samoan food I had down in Carson--it was so extremely oily and fatty that I had to fight to keep it down after a few bites.  Really thought there would be a Samoan-style mess on the floor... after my eyes stopped tearing into the trash it all went. ...... okay okay... just saying... I've only had richer once.\n\nImagine... foie gras but instead of liver, it's face.  ...(.... okay... that didn't sound good either...)...\n\nUm, ...imagine beyond-ultra-marble Kobe beef, melting like butter just sitting on your plate, but with eyeballs on top........... oh... damn...\n\nI GIVE UP.  Trust me, you want this.  10/10\n\n5. Duck Fat Cauliflower $7 \"red fresno & mint\":  I think I was so struck with the fish and head that I totally forgot to eat this.  Seriously.  ?/10\n\n6. Latte $5:  Smooth, creamy, light.  6/10\n\n7. Fruit Bread Pudding $8:  The waiter called this a \"bread pudding.\"  Really, maybe it could technically qualify as bread pudding?  Maybe?  Pretty big stretch though.  But just think of it as a fruit-drenched cake with lots of cream, oozing with flavor.  Tastes awesome.  They could work on plating though--looks pretty amateur.  Also... I dunno, it's not really what I'd expect to have at a nicer restaurant.  Marie Calledar's perhaps.  Anyway, tastes good, but doesn't really belong here.  7/10\n\nIf you haven't been here, I urge you to.\n\nIf you call yourself a foodie, this absolutely must be on your list.\n\nAnd if you do not like this place, not that you have to enjoy everything they serve, but if you simply do not want to order every family-style dish they got...... YOU LOST YOUR FOODIE CARD.  Immediately shredded.  Go find yourself an Olive Garden or something...\n\n4/5\n\n#sanfrancisco #american #star", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-09-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Def get their duck fat cauliflower, fresh burrata salad.

They take their protein very seriously (high quality, sustainably and humanely raised) and they don't shy away from bold flavors, which are both huge pluses in my book.\n\nCandice G. describes Cockscomb perfectly: this is where you eat like a Dothraki. Pure bliss as long as you don't limit yourself. \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Wednesday night during dinner peak hours. You'll need to make a reservation because the restaurant gets packed even on week nights. That being said, I made an online reservation the night before, so you won't don't need to plan months or weeks ahead like other restaurants in the city (perhaps you do for a weekend or Friday night reservation).\n\nFirst off, I love the decor of the restaurant. Very rustic furniture, big wooden tables, marble and comfy chairs, with an open kitchen that smells amazing against the cool brisk SF weather. They offer delicious cocktails, including my favorite gin and tonic (with fresh strawberry pur\u00e9e)! They offer sparkling or tap water, or both! Their open bar is pretty amazing with more cocktails than I had time to drink.\n\nFor those of you who haven't been here, Cockscomb is known for big plates New American-Italian style, to share over good conversations with old friends. The portions are meant to be family style and usually my friends and I wouldn't have it any other way. Their menu is decided into: 7 categories (wine and cocktail on separate menu):\n\n\"oysters and shellfish\"\n\"cured and raw\" \n\"starters and salads\" \n\"terrines\" \n\"shared supper\"\n\"offal and butcher's cut\" \n\"daily requirements\". \n\nDaily requirements are side dishes usually vegetables that is cooked in glistening animal fat. Honestly? I wanted to order and eat everything on the menu. Realistically? I'm coming back for more.\n\nBetween my friends and I, we ended up ordering too much food but that is usually as expected haha. The pig hearts were delicious! Definitely bigger, more tender and flavorful than I had thought. For starters, we shared the medium seafood platter of oysters ($48), Tombo crudo (hamachi crudo with interesting Asian inspired textures), pig skins with anchovy, olives and capers (this was amazing!). Both the smaller starters were $16 per.\n\nFor family supper slash big meat, we shared the beef heart tartar ($16), which was so interesting! Meaty, gamey with delicious marinade for the red meat offal. Their special of the night was a huge Wagyu T-bone shared supper. It was huge and smelled amazing. However, having recently returned from Japan where we had prized Wagyu and matsuzake beef, this was far less tasty and did not taste like Japanese Wagyu. While it was around $130, it wasn't nearly as good as what we had in Japanese because this was probably American Wagyu, another breed. It's also to be expected because even Wagyu in Japan is $$$ for a just few strips! Overall, it was still a delicious steak, superior to most I've had in America.\n\nAs for vegetables, our daily requirements were roasted duck fat cauliflower, crispy \"dirty\" potatoes, broccoli di ciccio and mushroom a la greque. All were delicious, well cooked and paired well with our rustic dinner bounty. Each daily requirement ranged around $7-9\n\nFor dessert, which we amazingly made room for, we shared the chocolate torte and another dessert which I don't remember anymore, other than they were tasty but were not mind blowing.\n\nOverall, great meal that is a pricey but nevertheless worth the splurge and experience! It's always a lot of fun to share a huge spread of mouthwatering food, family style, which Cockscomb is great for! Worth a return!

They KILL it and the truth is they don't have to. They're a meat place and everything from the name to sign will reinforce that but the Chef here still went above and beyond to create some incredible dishes for the non-meat and fish-eating friends and I really gotta give it up there because I've seen it done so rarely and even more rarely done well. \n\nOur server was too rad. I'd tell the table I'm waffling between some things because I want to ask about x and y and our guy would magically be right there with the answer just killing it. \n\nThe cocktails were sinfully good. \n+ I got the Pisco Punch (Pisco based punch with pineapple & Nutmeg) and at just $11 I would get it again every time. \n+ My second round was the Escape From Alcatraz (Sloanes gin, elderflower, mint, lemon, & elderflower tonic ) at $13 and it is potent and perfect and so well-presented that the rest of the table followed suit in ordering it as well. \n\nFor dinner my table split some stuff, most of which was meaty and hearty (literally, that lamb heart pastrami) and I did not partake but I did stuff myself with some notable delectable dishes. \n+ Broccoli Rabe Toast was something we shared but I wish I would've ordered my own because it was that good. \n+ The Grilled Cheese with duck egg and honey was the best grilled cheese I've ever had in my life.

This is a place that if you are a risk taker and adventurous with eating, you must come and try the dishes on the menu.  Every item we ordered was well seasoned and cook to perfection.  I would return to try the pin steak dish. One of the better culinary experience I have encountered.  On top of the great food, our wait staff was awesome making sure out water glasses were refilled and our waiter, Ian was so knowledgeable about the food and wine.  I will definitely be returning.  The only thing I was bummed out was not being able to see Chris Cosentino there.  With or without him, his team of Chefs ran a tight ship.  I hope he checks his Yelp reviews because if he was reading this, he needs to pay his Chefs more money.

Overall: very good experience, and once they get everything really dialed in I think this could be great. \n\nGin Jam cocktail: Fine, but nothing special, lacking a bit of punch/vibrancy. Nothing wrong with it, but I'd prob stick to beer or wine here (which imo accompany this food better anyway).\n\nUni butter, lardo, and dungeness crab bruschetta: Disappointing only because they said uni butter and there was absolutely zero uni taste at all. If they hadn't said that, would have been very happy with a tasty bruschetta with a great combo of crab and lardo.\n\nDuck fat cauliflower: very good, exactly as expected.\n\nRoasted pig's head: This was almost as epic looking as the whole beast at Incanto. Giant pig's head with a ton of meat to dig into. Tender, flavorful meat from all parts of the head, lots of delicious crispy fatty skin, and an extra-tasty ear. We tackled this with two of us, but I'd probably recommend this as a better dish for 4-6 people with other mains alongside. Great dish, and apparently they run out pretty early. Only minor issue with this dish is it comes with some endives that get a little oily on that plate and don't end up contrasting enough with this intensely rich dish, but that's a small nitpick about an excellent dish.\n\nThe dessert menu was like we got transported to a minimalist tasting menu restaurant - entries were \"chocolate, classic, (something else), cheese\" with no other info, so it was useless without having them explained. No big deal, just seems silly. Was totally stuffed at this point anyway.\n\nService was good. Sat at the bar, bartender was very nice and pretty knowledgeable about the menu. Rest of service staff was very good, everything went smoothly.\n\n$80 each with not much drinking. I recommend this place already, and suspect once they fine tune some things this will become a real favorite. Rest of the menu sounds great.

I ordered the quail and loved how juicy and tender the meat was. I also loved the variety of mushrooms included in the dish as I'm a huge mushroom lover. My BF had the & Chips which he thought was decent. It was a long and narrow pork sausage with a skin casing that had a great snap to it. The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that). I tried my friend's Calf's Liver and it surprisingly didn't have that strong of an iron taste that most livers have and was tender. Very glad I tried it. My other friends said they enjoyed their dishes as well, especially the Bavette Steak as it was perfectly cooked.\n\nService was fantastic. Watchful eyes constantly had our waters filled and napkins folded when we walked away. Empty plates quickly cleared away. One of our friends had all his drinks and dishes picked by our waiter and he enjoyed his choices. Definitely an interesting experience for him.\n\nChef Cosentino was there prepping many of the meals that night and showing the other chefs what to do. It was thrilling to watch him work! Our server found out that I was a fan of Chef Cosentino and checked to see if he would be willing to take a picture. He was busy but our server wouldn't let me leave until I got a picture (he actually blocked the door!). I'm super shy so one of my friends was able to get Chef Cosentino's attention to get a picture. Awesome that he's willing to step away and take some time with the clientele.\n\nAmazing experience and food. Highly recommend!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-12-01"}]}
