First off, we were not really hungry and just wanted a snack so why would we order more if we know we can't finish everything, not to mention the side dishes. So she decided to yell at me and gave me attitude by asking how much rice I wanted. I said we don't need much and before I finished, she said you get two rice bowls only and walked away.

When we told the waiter about the issue, he claimed that the fire went off because we put \"too much meat on top\" (there was only six small pieces of meat). He came back a second time to check on the grill and realized the flame was still off with two pieces of meat. He decided to just light up the grill and walked away and never came back. Our flame never came back on and they didn't bother to change our burnt bbq top. Next, I noticed the same chubby waitress was gossiping about us again but this time with a female coworker. They were both blatantly staring at us. When we called that female coworker over, she straight up threw the \"no\" hand signal at us and made a #2 hand signal (stereotype Chinese sign) to her other coworker while laughing.

While a tad bland, (maybe sans MSG), it did hit the spot and warmed me up! Soondobu was a soft silken tofu stew cooked with other vegs (or seafood if you prefer), served in a small cauldron, that infused deep, robust flavors. It was missing a cracked egg where the yolk gave it a bubbling volcanic effect while enhancing the overall flavor. (3/5)\n\nThe next dish was both good and interesting but I was somewhat intrigued by the difficult to pronounce name. Daeji Bulgogi ($23) was a hot plate of thinly sliced pork loin that was blended with soy and gochujang (a well-known, well-loved Korean chili paste) and pan cooked. It was served with a side of lettuce, which was used to wrap the cooked meat. The pork was well marinated, tender, slightly sweet and garlicky. The lettuce added a crunchy texture to the meat and helped tone down its saltiness and spiciness. I thought this was just simply finger licking good! (4/5)\n \nWe finished the meal with something chewy, sweet and slightly slippery! No, nothing from the ocean! It is one of Korea's best-loved dishes.....Japchae noodles ($12)! The noodles were made from sweet potato starch and stir-fried in multi color veggies. It also emanated terrific wok hay, had an addictive sesame oil flavor with just the right amount of garlic. The Japchae noodles had a lovely springy texture and chewy strips of beef.  Who says Koreans are not into noodles like the Chinese? Maybe only just not as much!

Not all of these mini plates were my favorite, but some of them, such as the Kimchi and marinated cucumbers were AMAZING! The restaurant was also kind enough to bring us the steamed egg dish on the house, which was very nice of them. \n\nI would've given this restaurant a full five stars, however, after we finished our meal and put down both of our credit cards, we received the credit card receipts back for signing purposes and realized that the restaurant had charged each of us the full price... From my perspective this was quite a silly mistake to make, but it felt as if they were testing my friend and I to see if we would just let it slide. Little did they know that we check the bill prior to leaving. \n\nOverall, the food was very good, the service was on point, but that last part (wrong charge on our cards) just threw me off and made me feel somewhat uncomfortable.

She made sure we were comfortable with the menu and introduced some of my friends who are fairly new to Korean food to some of her favorite dishes/popular dishes amongst the guests.\n\nWe decided to order the bulgogi which was very flavorful (serving is enough for two to share). My friend ordered the Seolleongtang which is an ox bone soup. We ordered two Soondoobu (soft tofu soup), one non-spicy, or \"white\", due to my request and the other being normal. My other friend ordered their bibimbap which he throughly enjoyed. Portions were very generous.\n\nTheir side dishes here known has \"banchan\" comes in a variety, varying from kimchi, kkadugi (cubed radish kimchi), myulchi bokkeum (stir-fried dried anchovies), sukjunamul (marinated mung bean sprouts), gaeranjim (steamed egg), etc...  Sangchu(lettuce) was also available. This made the experience the most exciting because not many Korean restaurants serve these type of side dishes.

The constant stream of Korean tourist being corralled in and out on a daily bases like a large herd of hungry cattle. And while the service can be measured on a scale of good to sometimes pretty bad. Han il Kwan is pretty much the best korean restaurant in SF hands down because of the food. \nThis place has been around as long as I can remember. When my family and I can to SF from Busan Korea....my Mom's first job was as a waitress here in the late 80's. So you can say, I pretty much grew up eating here all my life. (She's not working there anymore.) The services would be excellent if she was. Lol\nAnyways, owners have changed but the food still remains pretty close to home cooked, authentic korean cuisines. My favs are the Ahl chigae, (fish egg stew.) Yook geh jang, (spicy, shredded beef soup with japchae noodles.) I'll ask for extra spicy for that soup but its got pretty good heat as is. Everything that is spicy....u can get it milder or stronger.  The Ojing ah bokkem.(spicy squid with vegetables stir fry.) The bbq is good but I really believe the soups, stews and seafoods are the things that make me crave for the things that taste like home. \nI've learned that its easier and less, ( price wise,) to do lunch or lunch takeout. I've tried many other korean places in SF and this is by far the best. Especially if you like a lot of variety with banchans. \nIf you're looking to take a party with more than 5 people.

We usually go to Korean Village (on Geary), but A said there was this place on Balboa that is pretty good and Korean tourists go there all the time, so it MUST be good.  He was telling me all about how tour buses are always stopped there and the people are, like, straight from Korea.\n\nSo we drive over there and circle around for about 5-10 minutes looking for parking.  We find a spot less than a block and a half away and walk to the restaurant.  There's only one other booth filled, so we were greeted and seated immediately.\n\nWe decided to get the kalbi and the octopus.  We have a tendency to over-order and, hence, overeat.  They brought out some mung bean pancakes on the house and their spicy soft tofu soup as well as the assortment of banchan.  I like the mung bean pancakes, but I never order them because each order always has like twelve pancakes in them and I can't finish them all.  So this was good.  The tofu soup was good - not too spicy - and good flavor.  I like the assortment of banchan.  There was one dish which was like pickled, shredded potatoes.  Definitely my favorite, hands down.  I love potatoes.  I polished that whole dish off pretty much by myself.  They do offer refills of the banchan, but, as other Yelpers have mentioned, once a tour group comes in, it's pretty impossible to get any attention from the wait staff.  And wouldn't you know it, not only did three additional parties come in to fill the booths, but a busload of Korean tourists came in too.  It's all about timing.  If you make it there before tourists arrive or after they leave, it's an awesome place service-wise.\n\nAs for food, the kalbi was pretty good.  I've had better, but it's definitely good here.  The spicy octopus with vegetables was good, but the octopus was super chewy.  I like octopus and they are chewy.  It was just still a little difficult for me to chew after the teeth extractions.

Later that evening, I called again to tell the restaurant that our party of 10 for the bbq table would be 20 minutes late.  The person who I spoke with told me it was okay.

I told him I confirmed a bbq table for 10 and he told me that I called in and told them a party of 7 and later called in (when I called in to tell them we'd be late) and changed it to a party of 10...so they could do 7 outside to bbq but not 10.\n\nI was pretty angry then because of the error the restaurant made.

"], "author": "A P.", "review": "Not to be a jerk, but this place really doesn't deserve 4 stars. Sorry. Read on for why.\n\nSome 15-20 years ago, Han Il Kwan was under different ownership and had delicious Korean food. The owners moved on and, I believe, opened up Koryo Wood Charcoal in Oakland, which is a far, far superior restaurant in every possible way (except price if you're pinching pennies).\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a condescending, arrogant snob (sorry), I can only assume that the high review scores given to this restaurant are coming from folks who are not familiar with authentic Korean food (told you I'd come off like a snob). Being Korean myself, and having frequented much better restaurants (Brothers in San Francisco, Koryo in Oakland), I can say that this place is competent, and the best thing about it is the prices, which are a bit on the low side. Some of the cheaper soup/stew dishes, for instance, clock in at just around or under $10.\n\nThe \"new\" Han Il Kwan's cooking and preparation are competent and the food is definitely palatable, but nothing will set your soul afire. Also, and unfortunately, if you happen to have a taste for genuinely spicy Korean food, nothing here will set your tongue on fire either, since the spicier dishes, such as the yookyejang (spicy boiled beef stew) and kimchichigae (boiled-\"kimchi\"-spicy-cabbage stew) aren't really all that spicy at all. Please keep in mind, however, that this review is being written by a Korean fellow who has prefers his food SPICY, so if you have trouble handling spicy stuff, you may want to avoid the spicier dishes altogether and go with something milder like gomtang (non-spicy boiled beef stew), naengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles in cold broth--NOT bibimnaengmyun, which are cold buckwheat noodles in spicy sauce), or mandugook. And yes, with that last sentence...there's that pompous snob coming out again.\n\nHan Il Kwan apparently has some sort of deal with various Korean travel agencies; it's not uncommon to see one or more tour buses parked out in front of the restaurant around dinnertime on the weekends as Korean tourists pour out and pile into the restaurant. This is probably one of the more devious marketing maneuvers I've seen in a while, and weekend attendees at this restaurant may find themselves to be very impressed at the great number of REAL LIVE KOREAN PEOPLE who are patronizing this restaurant (much the same way that I'm patronizing anyone reading this review). Unfortunately, they're not here for the food; they're here because this is where the tour bus happened to stop. Brothers Restaurant on 6th and Geary otherwise has this place beat with fresher ingredients and flat-out tastier food. Presumably, it'd be harder to get a tour bus deal in the middle of Geary, which is, of course, the Richmond district's worst road in terms of traffic snarls.\n\nCons: Non-amazing food, non-amazing banchan, non-amazing spice level for soups and stews. Parking is also a serious pain in this neighborhood because it's residential, and parking spots in the Richmond district in general are laid out in a stupid manner that's extremely unfriendly to large cars. You may just want to take the 31 Balboa bus here if that's an option. It stops right in front of the restaurant.\n\nPros: Again, the 31 Balboa stops right in front of the restaurant, if that means anything to you. The restaurant also gives complimentary mini-bindaeduck (fried mung bean pancakes) with the purchase of every sit-down meal, and gives \"banchan\" side dishes that are plentiful, though they aren't amazingly fresh or flavorful. This place can also be a bit easier on your wallet, and the service is quite good, which is why I gave it the benefit of the doubt and 3 stars, rather than 2.\n\nIf you're looking for Korean food on the cheap and live nearby, Han Il Kwan is worth it for a quick, inexpensive meal with friends or family you know fairly well and don't need to impress.

Previously back in the day, my place was always one of the Brothers restaurants but when we moved back I found that the quality of the food is no longer as good as it once was.  After a few more times, we decided it was time to find somewhere new.\n\nHan Il Kwan is off the beaten path in a quiet residential part of the outer(ish) Richmond.  There is often a wait but during the week, you can usually find a table with a short wait time, maybes 5-15 minutes.  God help you on the weekends.  We've waited an hr before.  There are no decent bars nearby.  Not even good dive bars so waiting around here sucks.  The restaurant gives you the option of both cooking at the table and having them cook it for you in the kitchen.  But if you aren't familiar with K-food, give cooking at the table a try.  They'll help you too.  Note the funny receipt when you cook yourself: \"Cook at table.............$0\".  Lots of LOLZ for this. \n\nThe ladies who work here are great.  From the older waitresses, just the right amount of \"sternness\" you would deserve from the Korean aunties you never had (or do have!).  They don't have time to wait around for you to go the through the menu asking questions.  Peruse, then ask.  Korean BBQ dining is not for chatting or having a laugh with the waitresses unless they know you or you are a regular.    I have found the younger waitresses are more patient, \"nicer\" and speak clearer English (for those of you who have trouble with accents).  Not to say that the aunties are not nice, just stern.  Maybe you need to be past your mid-forties to graduate to a finger-wagging aunty. That said, the aunty waitresses are super efficient and will basically just take over if they see you cooking incorrectly or if you appear to be out of your depth.  One time I took my Dad and he prematurely tried to turn over some Kalbi before it was ready and the waitress [lovingly] smacked his hand with a stern \"not yet\". LOVE THIS PLACE.\n\nI have read that they can accommodate people with allergies which is great, but I would heed my previous advice and try to be as prepared with your questions as possible.  I personally feel that people with self-diagnosed restrictions such as \"gluten-intolerance\" should just expect gluten to appear in most places like this- unless of course they have celiac disease.....or something else that's REAL. I feel most good Asian restaurants in general, unless they are new wave, fusion, trendy or expensive, will not be gluten free or accommodate allergies. So that this place WILL is a wonderful! I've got a friend who self diagnoses herself as gluten intolerant, has to go over each item on the menu WITH the waiter, is particularly picky about \"cross-contamination\" and has to have tamari soy sauce, not normal soy sauce.  I won't be taking her here. \n\nThe food here is excellent.  Admittedly I am no longer adventurous with Korean BBQ bc I KNOWS WHAT I LIKES. I'm just a creature of habit.  The banchan (small side dishes) are just great here and I tend to \"graze\" on those all night long.  They don't give you as many options as some other Korean restaurants, but the kimchi and other various pickles here are legit. Plus they are generous on the refills! They also give you a choice of steamed egg custard \"Gyeran jjim\" or a spicy tofu \"Jjigae\" stew.  You can specify, so if you have a pref, ask.\n\nWe always get a Pajeon \"seafood pancake\" but if you don't eat seafood they have other versions.  I personally love Kimchi Jeon too! I also find it compulsory to order Jap Chae, a \"low calorie\" noodle dish, most aptly compared to eating heaven.  It is not questioned when Jap Chae is order at our table.  \n\nMost importantly, meat-wise: if you are not adventurous or are set-in-your-ways like me, I would recommend the beef kalbi, the daeji bulgogi and perhaps the pork belly if you are particularly hungry.  These 3 choices of meat combined with the other dishes I mentioned is more than enough for 4 hungry people, especially if they are drinking Beer or Soju with dinner.  \n\nLast time we ordered this \"basic\", there were 4 of us and we went home with lots of leftovers.  Keep in mind, we destroy the banchan, ask for refills and wrap out meat in the provided lettuce leafs.   This best way about eating like this is that you get the gristly richness of the meat,  the fresh crunchiness of the lettuce and pickles and the simple steamed rice, which makes for a very balanced combination of flavors.  Of course you have the other dishes as well which gives you some excellent additional varieties of flavours and textures!\n\nHappy eating, you won't be disappointed with this place!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Choice of seats, hurray! \n\n"], "author": "Claire S.", "review": "Hailing from the land of Southern California (for my formative years, at least), KBBQ was a solid staple in my diet. While I can't say I was thrilled by the concept of AYCE meat, the ice cream offered afterwards at places like Flower Pig or Cham Sut Gol kept KBBQ as a meal of comfortable, delicious comfort.\n\nOperating on a protein-based diet these days, KBBQ made sense for a recent weekend dinner. I called in reservations a few days in advance for a Saturday night with no issue, and conveniently arrived right after a large busload of Korean tourists were taken away. Choice of seats, hurray! \n\nAim for one of the covered tables with a grill, and you'll be set.\n\nTHE OVERVIEW.\n+ Fast service, even when they get slammed. Also, quality service - not a single server forgot any request we had (we made the mistake of asking 3 different servers for more banchan, and received 3 additional sets - yum!)\n~ It's a bit pricey, but the quality of the meat is delicious. It's not AYCE, but who wants the meat sweats anyways?\n+ Good selection of soju and other drinks\n\nDelicious dinner, best if enjoyed in a group or 3 or more. Also, at 8 pm on a Saturday there was a line out the door, so come early or make reservations!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-09-13"}, {"excerpts": ["We were given the choice to either be seated at a table with a grill or a regular table. "], "author": "Julia K.", "review": "Ever since I've been little, I've always passed by this restaurant and noticed how packed it was. I never got around to trying it out until just last week. I'm honestly surprised at how late I got around to trying it, as Korean food is one of my favorites. \n\nMy friend and I got to the restaurant around 6pm on Thursday and there were a lot of open tables, however within 30 minutes there was a line waiting outside, which definitely says a lot about a place. We were given the choice to either be seated at a table with a grill or a regular table. We decided to sit a regular table because we weren't in the mood to make our own food and we just wanted to order straight from the menu. \n\nWe ordered the following items:\n\n1. Bulgogi ---Hands down some of the most tender and juicy bulgogi that I've had in my life. The flavor definitely did not disappoint, but I do have to say, for the portion that's given, it's not worth the $24.00. \n2. Soft Tofu Soup (Not spicy) --- We asked to have the soup non spicy which turned out great. The tofu was super soft and every sip was truly enjoyable. \n3. Hot Stone Pot Bi-Bim Bab --- The bi-bim bap was also superb. The stone pot kept the rice and veggies hot for about an hour and continued cooking the rice to crispness at the bottom. It formed the most delicious golden crust and made the dish even more tasty.\n4. Pan Fried Tofu--- I would totally recommend this dish to those who love spicy tofu because the entire top is covered with spicy sauce and spices. The tofu itself was low on flavorful and not really what I wanted, but this may have been because I'm a harsh tofu critic. \n\nIn addition to all the items that we ordered, each table gets little plates called Banchan. These little side plates are all different and fun to try because they're very different than your typical American side dishes. Not all of these mini plates were my favorite, but some of them, such as the Kimchi and marinated cucumbers were AMAZING! The restaurant was also kind enough to bring us the steamed egg dish on the house, which was very nice of them. \n\nI would've given this restaurant a full five stars, however, after we finished our meal and put down both of our credit cards, we received the credit card receipts back for signing purposes and realized that the restaurant had charged each of us the full price... From my perspective this was quite a silly mistake to make, but it felt as if they were testing my friend and I to see if we would just let it slide. Little did they know that we check the bill prior to leaving. \n\nOverall, the food was very good, the service was on point, but that last part (wrong charge on our cards) just threw me off and made me feel somewhat uncomfortable. I really do hope that this isn't something they try with each of their guests, so take an extra minute to check your bill before paying!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-09-11"}, {"excerpts": ["They give you free banchan, rice, AND choice of tofu soup or steamed egg.

I enjoyed it immensely, and here are some key points that come into eating here.\n\nLocation: 5/5\nThe restaurant is located on 19th and Balboa, in a small corner shop of the street. The place looks quaint and small, but the inside has a large area with two huge cooking tables and other any tables surrounding it, plus a back area with more tables. When you go in, you sign into a paper to get seated and it goes quick. Me and my family came in quickly during the lunch rush hour and got seated within 5 minutes. Parking for cars may get a bit hard as the streets are very packed, so make sure to keep searching!\n\nFood/Pricing: 5/5\nOkay, okay. This food is incredible. They give you free banchan, rice, AND choice of tofu soup or steamed egg. I have never been to a place that gives out free tofu soup, but they gave our table two free soups and it was really good. I usually don't enjoy soup, but this one wasn't overly spicy, still flavorful, and the tofu was really soft. The star of the banchan was the kimchi. My god, the radishes were fresh and cold, really snapped in my mouth and were refreshing, while the cabbage had the sour taste that made your mouth reminisce of past kimchi experiences, but better in that it was stronger in taste and the cabbage was fresh. We also ordered dwaegi-bulgolgi (spicy pork), seafood pancake, and japchae (glass noodles). The spicy pork was really good, also not as spicy but tasty meat. The seafood pancake we got was huge, with 8 pieces filled with vegetables and squid that made me extremely satisfied. The japchae was the most normal out do the bunch, not too bad but also not that good. Everything else made up for it, however. They also give you a little bit of rice water at the end, to clear your mouth which was awesome. I had that done in a restaurant only once in the past. The pricing was typical of a Korean a-la-carte place, mid-range around $25 for meat and $15 for other food, but nothing that broke the bank too much.\n\nService: 4/5\nThe service here was quick paced and nice. The ladies that served us were rapid and to the point, but also courteous as they allowed us to order while we discussed what we should still order. It did, however, take us three times to get our drinks after receiving our food, and when we wanted to get to-go boxes, one lady looked past us TWICE and didn't come to our tables. Our main server, however, was nice and she made it up to us. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're ever in the Richmond District or the Bay Area and want some good Korean food, this place is the best.

We got to choose two kinds of meat, and it comes with tofu soup, squid with veggies, bibimbap, broiled fish, stir fried vermicelli, pan fried shrimps and veggies, steamed eggs. Yup definitely had a lot of left overs.\n\nHonestly, I think the food was okay but kinda pricey. I really like the rice juice they gave out at the end though. It was sweet and refreshing. I recommend to try it. I would prob go back here if I'm around the area only... because really, parking is hard to find.\n\nThe customer service was not that great so just be prepared. We were only given three servings of rice and when I asked for the other two, the lady came back with one rice. So I asked her later again and she seemed irritated. She answered \"I gave you one already!\" \n\nWell duh? I know that, but I asked for two! I needed one more that's why I asked her. It didn't occur to her I guess? Maybe didn't hear my \"two\". She didn't seem too happy and since they were busy I felt like I was bothering her. I understand that they were busy and I didn't really care about that missing rice.  I just didn't like they way she had to raise her voice at me. I was only asking for a rice and she yelled at me in front of my friends.=/ Anyway, she didn't come back with the other one.

Been coming here ever since we discovered it upon moving back to SF in 2016.  Previously back in the day, my place was always one of the Brothers restaurants but when we moved back I found that the quality of the food is no longer as good as it once was.  After a few more times, we decided it was time to find somewhere new.\n\nHan Il Kwan is off the beaten path in a quiet residential part of the outer(ish) Richmond.  There is often a wait but during the week, you can usually find a table with a short wait time, maybes 5-15 minutes.  God help you on the weekends.  We've waited an hr before.  There are no decent bars nearby.  Not even good dive bars so waiting around here sucks.  The restaurant gives you the option of both cooking at the table and having them cook it for you in the kitchen.  But if you aren't familiar with K-food, give cooking at the table a try.  They'll help you too.  Note the funny receipt when you cook yourself: \"Cook at table.............$0\".  Lots of LOLZ for this. \n\nThe ladies who work here are great.  From the older waitresses, just the right amount of \"sternness\" you would deserve from the Korean aunties you never had (or do have!).  They don't have time to wait around for you to go the through the menu asking questions.  Peruse, then ask.  Korean BBQ dining is not for chatting or having a laugh with the waitresses unless they know you or you are a regular.    I have found the younger waitresses are more patient, \"nicer\" and speak clearer English (for those of you who have trouble with accents).  Not to say that the aunties are not nice, just stern.  Maybe you need to be past your mid-forties to graduate to a finger-wagging aunty. That said, the aunty waitresses are super efficient and will basically just take over if they see you cooking incorrectly or if you appear to be out of your depth.  One time I took my Dad and he prematurely tried to turn over some Kalbi before it was ready and the waitress [lovingly] smacked his hand with a stern \"not yet\". LOVE THIS PLACE.\n\nI have read that they can accommodate people with allergies which is great, but I would heed my previous advice and try to be as prepared with your questions as possible.  I personally feel that people with self-diagnosed restrictions such as \"gluten-intolerance\" should just expect gluten to appear in most places like this- unless of course they have celiac disease.....or something else that's REAL. I feel most good Asian restaurants in general, unless they are new wave, fusion, trendy or expensive, will not be gluten free or accommodate allergies. So that this place WILL is a wonderful! I've got a friend who self diagnoses herself as gluten intolerant, has to go over each item on the menu WITH the waiter, is particularly picky about \"cross-contamination\" and has to have tamari soy sauce, not normal soy sauce.  I won't be taking her here. \n\nThe food here is excellent.  Admittedly I am no longer adventurous with Korean BBQ bc I KNOWS WHAT I LIKES. I'm just a creature of habit.  The banchan (small side dishes) are just great here and I tend to \"graze\" on those all night long.  They don't give you as many options as some other Korean restaurants, but the kimchi and other various pickles here are legit. Plus they are generous on the refills! They also give you a choice of steamed egg custard \"Gyeran jjim\" or a spicy tofu \"Jjigae\" stew.  You can specify, so if you have a pref, ask.\n\nWe always get a Pajeon \"seafood pancake\" but if you don't eat seafood they have other versions.  I personally love Kimchi Jeon too! I also find it compulsory to order Jap Chae, a \"low calorie\" noodle dish, most aptly compared to eating heaven.  It is not questioned when Jap Chae is order at our table.  \n\nMost importantly, meat-wise: if you are not adventurous or are set-in-your-ways like me, I would recommend the beef kalbi, the daeji bulgogi and perhaps the pork belly if you are particularly hungry.  These 3 choices of meat combined with the other dishes I mentioned is more than enough for 4 hungry people, especially if they are drinking Beer or Soju with dinner.  \n\nLast time we ordered this \"basic\", there were 4 of us and we went home with lots of leftovers.  Keep in mind, we destroy the banchan, ask for refills and wrap out meat in the provided lettuce leafs.   This best way about eating like this is that you get the gristly richness of the meat,  the fresh crunchiness of the lettuce and pickles and the simple steamed rice, which makes for a very balanced combination of flavors.  Of course you have the other dishes as well which gives you some excellent additional varieties of flavours and textures!\n\nHappy eating, you won't be disappointed with this place!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["He handed it to me, along with a shot of Soju.\n\n", "The pork belly carries very heavy flavors, so the Soju serves as a perfect complement to the after taste.

Nor is it the puzzling enigma that is their name (is it Han 2 Kwan or Han 'ill' Kwan?). No, the most conspicuous thing about Han Il Kwan is the gigantic tour bus that is always waiting by its door.\n\nPrincess Carewee and I walk by Han Il Kwan quite often, and witnessing a hoard of tourists being ushered into the restaurant has become quite a regular sight. As #blessed as I have made my life look on the gram, I have actually had some unfortunate experiences in traveling with a tour group. And from these pitiful experiences, I know very well for a fact that these tour groups bring you to the crappiest restaurants in town. Thus, that humongous tour bus always appeared to me as a \"DO NOT COME HERE\" sign. So I just never went to Han Il Kwan.\n\nThat was until one afternoon, when my homie Colin M. invited me to lunch.\n\n\"How about Han Il Kwan?\"\n\n\"Oh you mean Han 2 Kwan?\"\n\n\"Yeah, maybe, that one Korean place at the corner? With that tour bus parked outside?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah I know that one. Uhhhh you sure you want that place?\"\n\n\"Yeah man let's go.\"\n\nWe arrived inside Han Il Kwan a little bit after 12. There were no tourists today, but the restaurant was still filled with a healthy number of other patrons. That was my first time inside, and the Korean style d\u00e9cor already had me impressed. When we were seated by the booth, we were given the option of having cooked dishes, or doing KBBQ.\n\n\"KBBQ!\" I blurted. \n\nMama ain't raised no fool. There's not a lot for the restaurant to mess up on if the meats are uncooked. The quality may be shotty, but at least I can somewhat control the flavors.\n\nWithin 10 minutes of the Korean small dishes, the meats arrived. The chicken looked tender and soft. And the pork belly, well, that was a marbled-marvel. Colin M. must have saw the surprised look in my eye, so he grabbed my attention.\n\n\"Looks good, huh? Give me 2 to 3 minutes to fix you something amazing.\"\n\nColin placed 2 pieces of the pork belly on to the grill. It sizzled at the touch. The fat oozed out bubbles of oil, releasing an aroma that made my mouth water. After a brief period, he turned it over with the tongs, revealing a side of perfectly charcoaled belly fat. It was a sight to behold.\n\nWhen the meat was finished, Colin placed it on a green leaf of lettuce. He sprinkled some rice, added a dab of kimchi, and wrapped it all up. He handed it to me, along with a shot of Soju.\n\n\"Here. Eat this in one bite. The pork belly carries very heavy flavors, so the Soju serves as a perfect complement to the after taste. I call this, The Lettuce Shot.\"\n\nI put the Lettuce Shot into my mouth. The flavors from the pork belly exploded through the lettuce. The rice blended with the flavor, but offered itself as another texture in the experience. The kimchi splashed in a taste of pickled spice, completing the package. I threw down the Soju shot immediately after. The subtle flavors in Soju is accentuated amidst the saltiness of the Pork Belly after taste, leaving a pleasant sweet sensation. The burn of the alcohol all but disappeared from all the oil of that one bite. It was awesome. The Lettuce Shot was awesome.\n\nSo Colin M. and I spent that afternoon doing Lettuce Shots in Han Il Kwan. It was one of the more enjoyable lunches in recent memory. After the meal, the waitress served us this small cup of sweet soup, which was an ideal ending to such a heavy lunch. I was wrong, so wrong. Han Il Kwan (definitely \"ill\") was great.\n\nI learned an important lesson that day.

The egg the serve is always a perfect sunny side up to crack and mix all into the bowl, but it was a little skimp on the meat.\n\nThis time around my bf and I decided to get spicy pork and bulgolgi, which they cook for you if you opt out of grilling it yourself.

"], "author": "Priscilla C.", "review": "So, I'm a Korean from So Cal where there is an abundance of Korean businesses such as markets, boutiques, bakeries, bars/sooljibs and of course restaurants.  Even down in So Cal I never really go out to eat at Korean restaurants just because I don't see the point in paying money for food I can eat for free at home where the quality of ingredients surpasses any restaurant in LA and is made with extra love from mom.  ;] \n\nHowever, for some reason before I went on my last trip to SF I had the biggest craving for dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice with veggies, meat, egg and spicy chili paste cooked in a stone bowl).  I tried to ignore my craving, hoping it would subside after a few days, but no... I had to surrender.  \n\nTo be honest I was a little wary of going to eat Korean in SF as competition isn't that high amongst Korean restaurants as it is in LA so one might think that their A game is equivalent to LA's B game in regards to Korean food.  I did however, take note that Han Il Kwan has an impressive rating on Yelp that made me a little more comfortable of trying it out.  \n\nService was okay to good.  The older lady was alright and got the job done when it came to waitressing... the younger male was really cool & friendly towards my friend and I without giving us a stink face when we asked for extra banchan.\n\nSo here's the low down on the show down...\n\nDolsot Bibimbap - lunch portion was a huge portion... came with all the usual suspects of assorted veggies, pieces of beef, rice, fried egg and a squirt bottle of Korean chili paste.  I asked for a little side of sesame oil as I couldn't taste any when I took my first bite.  Overall it was a standard bowl of dolsot bibimbap, tasting better after I added the oil in combination with my heavy load of chili paste.  Not out of this world and not unsatisfying as if definitely satiated my craving.\n\nKalbi - It was okay... I don't know if it's because I've been spoiled with my mom's own need to make kalbi every time she sees that short ribs are on sale at the market or if because my tastebuds have become jaded living in LA.  Not disgusting, not amazeballs... more like a..\"these shall do\" kind of reaction.\n\nTofu soup - (Not soon tofu, but a spicy soup with veggies & tofu) Comes free with your lunch meal, I was pleasantly surprised with this soup.  Usually I don't really like soups like these so I didn't really taste my portion till later on in my meal.  It was quite tasty with the chunks of zucchinis I really enjoyed and a perfect side to go with my bibimbap.\n\nNokdoboochim (pancake) - It's always a plus for me when a restaurant gives any type of Korean style pancake as a complimentary appetizer.  These were the kind made out of grounded beans, they might have been free but they tasted like they were worth paying for. \n\nBanchan - Typical side dishes you'd get at any Korean spot...acorn jelly with seasoned soy sauce, kimchi, saut\u00e9ed oden, bean sprouts/soy beans sprouts, pickled veggies, and I forget what others.  None of them really stood out for me, but then again I was more focused on attacking my entree which was seriously a big portion.  \n\nAfter meal dessert drink (shikhye) - For real, super brownie points after giving the BEST Korean drink -better than soju, makgoli, bekseju, mekju, etc.  Sweet malted rice drink...the Korean's version of horchata perhaps???  BOMB.  No better way to end a Korean feast.  \n\nI don't know if I'll come back just because I still don't know how I feel about eating Korean in SF when I can just drive over to Ktown in LA where each restaurant is competing with the restaurant next door specializing in the same damn thing as them.    My meal, overall was standard, nothing blew me out of the water...okay maybe the dessert beverage did, but hey that should just be the icing on the cake right?

I'm not sure if it's because we were super hungry, but we were really satisfied and happy with most of the food!

Parking wasn't fun, but got lucky.  We get in and see two groups ahead of us, yet the restaurant had all these empty tables that needed to be cleared.  That gave me a bad first impression (why not clean the tables and let the people sit).  No one came up to us to ask how many in our party or anything.  So I started getting skeptical.  Within 5 minutes of getting to the restaurant, a string of korean people come in... non-stop.  A korean tour bus had just come.  So then it made sense, all the workers were busy setting up the table for this large group.  Once the group got seated in the back room, I see all these workers cleaning tables and that's when someone came to greet us.  Yes, not the most friendly of greetings, but cordial and fine.  \n\nThe food was good (but my mom's is better).  I think the kimchi at 90% of korean restaurants suck, this one was good/pretty good.  We ordered (the prices are what I think it was, don't quote me):\n\ngalbi chim (beef rib stew, sort of) ~$24: large potatoes, large carrots, good sauce, tender. very yum.  You can't really go wrong with galbi chim, but this one was like home cooking, not typical restaurant style\n\nDaenjangjigae (bean paste stew) ~$11: it was good.  tofu, jalapenos, not too strong smelling (I wanted my non-korean friend to try it)\n\nDukbokki (spicy rice cake) $~12 : this was really good.  It's not as spicy as most places (which is good and bad).  But still had enough heat at the end.  b/c it wasn't as spicy, you could taste more flavors. I brought some home to my mom, and she said it was pretty good dukbokki.\n\nKimchi jun (kimchi pancake) ~$14: I really liked this. It is pretty thick, but fully cooked.  Sometimes when juns are thick, they are not fully cooked all the way through and I hate that.  This was good stuff.  \n\nI thought the service was fine, but we weren't demanding diners (and we didn't do BBQ.

On one random occasion, my family and I decided to check the restaurant out. Like any other Korean restaurant they serve you with the many small appetizers. The sardines and that fish cake was mm mm good. I've tried almost everything there except for the stuff you cook at your table. I'm not a fan of that stuff because it makes your clothes smell. On a cold night, I recommend the tofu soup because it just has the right amount of spice. Sometimes the tofu soup is on the house..I guess it depends on how much you order. If you decide to drink soju there, then try the one with a white label with gold letters. I don't know what the brand name is but the soju was good enough to not get you hammered.

"], "author": "Priscilla C.", "review": "So, I'm a Korean from So Cal where there is an abundance of Korean businesses such as markets, boutiques, bakeries, bars/sooljibs and of course restaurants.  Even down in So Cal I never really go out to eat at Korean restaurants just because I don't see the point in paying money for food I can eat for free at home where the quality of ingredients surpasses any restaurant in LA and is made with extra love from mom.  ;] \n\nHowever, for some reason before I went on my last trip to SF I had the biggest craving for dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice with veggies, meat, egg and spicy chili paste cooked in a stone bowl).  I tried to ignore my craving, hoping it would subside after a few days, but no... I had to surrender.  \n\nTo be honest I was a little wary of going to eat Korean in SF as competition isn't that high amongst Korean restaurants as it is in LA so one might think that their A game is equivalent to LA's B game in regards to Korean food.  I did however, take note that Han Il Kwan has an impressive rating on Yelp that made me a little more comfortable of trying it out.  \n\nService was okay to good.  The older lady was alright and got the job done when it came to waitressing... the younger male was really cool & friendly towards my friend and I without giving us a stink face when we asked for extra banchan.\n\nSo here's the low down on the show down...\n\nDolsot Bibimbap - lunch portion was a huge portion... came with all the usual suspects of assorted veggies, pieces of beef, rice, fried egg and a squirt bottle of Korean chili paste.  I asked for a little side of sesame oil as I couldn't taste any when I took my first bite.  Overall it was a standard bowl of dolsot bibimbap, tasting better after I added the oil in combination with my heavy load of chili paste.  Not out of this world and not unsatisfying as if definitely satiated my craving.\n\nKalbi - It was okay... I don't know if it's because I've been spoiled with my mom's own need to make kalbi every time she sees that short ribs are on sale at the market or if because my tastebuds have become jaded living in LA.  Not disgusting, not amazeballs... more like a..\"these shall do\" kind of reaction.\n\nTofu soup - (Not soon tofu, but a spicy soup with veggies & tofu) Comes free with your lunch meal, I was pleasantly surprised with this soup.  Usually I don't really like soups like these so I didn't really taste my portion till later on in my meal.  It was quite tasty with the chunks of zucchinis I really enjoyed and a perfect side to go with my bibimbap.\n\nNokdoboochim (pancake) - It's always a plus for me when a restaurant gives any type of Korean style pancake as a complimentary appetizer.  These were the kind made out of grounded beans, they might have been free but they tasted like they were worth paying for. \n\nBanchan - Typical side dishes you'd get at any Korean spot...acorn jelly with seasoned soy sauce, kimchi, saut\u00e9ed oden, bean sprouts/soy beans sprouts, pickled veggies, and I forget what others.  None of them really stood out for me, but then again I was more focused on attacking my entree which was seriously a big portion.  \n\nAfter meal dessert drink (shikhye) - For real, super brownie points after giving the BEST Korean drink -better than soju, makgoli, bekseju, mekju, etc.  Sweet malted rice drink...the Korean's version of horchata perhaps???  BOMB.  No better way to end a Korean feast.  \n\nI don't know if I'll come back just because I still don't know how I feel about eating Korean in SF when I can just drive over to Ktown in LA where each restaurant is competing with the restaurant next door specializing in the same damn thing as them.    My meal, overall was standard, nothing blew me out of the water...okay maybe the dessert beverage did, but hey that should just be the icing on the cake right?  I suppose if I were to be randomly craving Korean in SF again this would be my first pick because service was good and the food didn't disappoint.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-05-17"}], "maechuisoon": [], "makgeoilee": [], "bokbunja": []}
