I was in my very early twenties and a few years or so have passed and this place remains just as fabulous as the first time.   I've been here over a dozen times, from business meetings, dates and birthday celebrations.   \n\nOn Christmas eve, two of my best girlfriends and I were here to celebrate my friends birthday.  We ordered several appetizers and entrees and shared each one.    I LOVE that when I go out to dinner with my best girlfriends that we always end up eating family style.  This way we can try as many dishes as possible without breaking the bank.  We ordered the following dishes for appetizers and split them: \n\nITALIAN MOZZARELLA & DINO KALE SALAD\nTreviso Radicchio, Napa Cabbage\nRoasted Meyer Lemon & Garlic Dressing \nReview: I loved this dish and will probably chop up my kale the way they did.  Very light and refreshing. \n\nBEER BATTERED ARGENTINIAN RED PRAWNS\nSalsa Molcajete, Lemon Aioli \nReview: There were about 5 prawns and there were 3 of us.  \nWe each had 1 and then tried to fight over the 2.  Ha!  In the end, we just cut up the other 2 into tiny pieces and split those. These were delicious. \n\nSPICY SESAME AHI TUNA TARTARE\nMiso Cucumbers, Charred Shishito Peppers, Lime Aioli\nShiso Tempura, Nori & Taro Chips \nReview:  This was OK and nothing to write home about\n\nLobster Bisque Soup\nReview:  LOVED dipping my bread into this soup and the waitress mentioned this is their specialty.  It wasn't on the menu so you may ask your server if they have it. \n\nFor our main entrees, we ordered the following: \n\nGRILLED SWORDFISH\nCalamari Stuffed with Clam & Pancetta Panzanella\nSauteed Spigarello with Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Tomato Relish\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\nReview:  This was just OK and I will probably not order it again.  My friends felt the same\n\nSEARED HOKKAIDO SEA SCALLOPS\nGolden Beet Risotto, Vacca Bianca Parmesan \nReview:  This was my FAVORITE dish.  I loved the risotto and will return soon for this dish.  Delicious! \n\nBRAISED BERKSHIRE PORK RIB CAP with ROASTED GULF PRAWNS\nSpanish Style Paella with Roasted Tomato, Green Garbanzo Beans & Chorizo\nSmoked Paprika & Pork \nReview:  I seldom eat pork so I didn't try the pork but had the prawns and paella and it was just wonderful. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the following: \n\nBUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING\nDark Chocolate Bavarian Cream, Pecan Shortbread\nWild Pecan Granola, Vanilla Chantilly \nReview:  I DIDN't want to share this dish.  It was that good.  Definitely try this.  You will LOVE.  Our waitress said this was her favorite dish. \n\nCHOCO-LICIOUS\nBaked Hot Chocolate Cake, Mousse, Wafer\nDark Chocolate Ice Cream & Meringue \nReview: If you like dark chocolate, definitely try this dish.  I wasn't in love with it but it was definitely good! \n\nOur meal was amazing as always and I will return. Fun fact:  Jay-Z and Beyonce also dined here during their 2014 On The Run Tour.  I saw it with my own eyes in a picture on an article somewhere haha.  No really they did, it's even stated on this SF Eater article:  http://sf.eater.com/2014/8/7/6173823/where-beyonce-and-jay-z-ate-during-their-sf-visit  So if you want to dine like hip hop royalty, definitely try it out. \n\nLove and highly recommend this place!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-12-27"}, {"excerpts": ["For starters we shared the goat cheese and medjool date salad along with the spicy sesame ahi tuna tartare and the seared sea scallops.

"], "author": "Andrew C.", "review": "I visited Boulevard on Friday night with two friends that live in the city. I have to say I was little skeptical at first because I had read recent mixed reviews of a lot of \"hype\" with under delivery, but ultimately was convinced by all of the positive recommendations I had received from friends and fellow Yelpers (thanks guys!). Man am I glad we decided to go! When we arrived through the rotating front door we were immediately captivated by the trendy decor, such as the brick style ceiling and stylish lights. It reminded me of a trendy New York restaurant, like something you would see in SOHO. We were seated promptly and greeted by our friendly server who took our drink order. However, when we had questions about some of the wines on the menu, she answered with non-informative, lukewarm, descriptions. Kind of a disappointing start to the evening, but at least it was only the wine list and the only isolated complaint I can offer. She gave us a few minutes to mull over our decision, and we decided on a California red (Prelude Pinot Noir - very good). When it was time to order appetizers, she instantly transformed into a knowledgable foodie who was able to break down all of the dishes! Thank goodness for the transformation, as all of her recommendations that we ended up ordering were great. She had explained that the appetizer selections were on the smaller side, and they were designed to be ordered \"one per person\" to accompany each meal. We opted to order 3 appetizers and share them so we could all try a little sample of each. The first appetizer was the Spicy Sesame Ahi Tuna Tartare. It was very high grade tuna, and it was prepared and tasted exceptional. Next was the Porcini appetizer which was well prepared and tasted good. Finally, we split the Veal Sweetbreads. Wow, these things were good! If you have never had sweetbreads before, or are hesitant on ordering them because of where they come from (animal thymus), put all of that behind you and try them. By far the best appetizer we ordered. For the main course I ordered the Eden Valley Berkshire (Kurobuta) Pork Prime Rib Chop. It was very tender and juicy, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. I also tried a taste of my friend's Pan Roasted Local Wild Salmon. I like fish but I'm not a big fan of Salmon, but this dish was cooked to perfection and tasted fantastic. Finally, I had a small taste of my friend's Wood Oven Roasted Angus Filet Mignon. I wish I would have ordered this one for myself because it was one of the most tender, flavorful, and best prepared filets I have ever tried! You will not regret ordering this one! We decided to skip dessert as it was late and we figured we would end up having a night cap at a local bar in the Mission. \n\nIn conclusion, this was one of the best dining experiences that I have ever had. I would definitely consider myself a foodie, and I enjoy fine cuisine at new restaurants. Expect to pay about $80+ per person, but remember that you get what you pay for. If I could rate this place more than 5 stars I would. This place is definitely worthy of the Michelin rating...\n\nOne last word of advice: Good luck finding the bathrooms! They seem to be a mile away from the dining room and they are not labeled clearly. I thought at one point I had walked through a different restaurant to get to it! Maybe it was just me or maybe that was an intentional part of the \"mystique\", but nonetheless you may want to hold it if you want to get back to your table before dinner arrives!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-05-12"}], "seared sea scallops": [{"excerpts": ["For starters we shared the goat cheese and medjool date salad along with the spicy sesame ahi tuna tartare and the seared sea scallops.

Yah... I didn't get that here. I'd been looking forward to checking this place out for awhile and finally made it here and was greatly disappointed. \n\nThis place reminds me of One Market. It's one of those restaurants down in the Financial District catering to the business men and women who are in hotels nearby. It's supposed to be great, but only ok. \n\nStarters: \nAHI TUNA ITO-ZUKURI\n*Hand Line Caught,\"Ribbon-Cut\" Ahi Tuna Yuzu-Coriander Braised Hodo Soy Tofu Natural Enoki Mushrooms, Scallions & Black Sesame Wild Rice \"Furikake\", Sudachi Lime Yuzu Aioli \n- My bf had this dish, but I tried it and it was pretty good. The enoki mushrooms were really scrumptious. The ahi itself was a little bland. I expected a little more flavor from it. \n\nPAN SEARED SEA SCALLOPS\n* Artichoke Hearts, Fresh Shelling Beans & Sea Spinach Preserved Lemon, Castelvetrano Olive & Amaranth Gremolata\n- My starter, however, kicked my bf's starters bootie. This was really delicious. The artichoke hearts were tasty and gave a nice saltiness eaten with the scallops. The olives weren't overpowering at all, which I expected. Instead they gave a nice freshness to the dish. \n\nMains: \nANGUS FILET MIGNON\n* Wood Oven Roasted Potatoes Cacio E Pepe: Red Thumb Fingerlings with Pecorino, Parmesan & Crushed Black Pepper Roasted King Trumpet Mushrooms, Shaved Scarlett Turnips & Roasted Radishes with Thyme Sauteed Bloomsdale Spinach, Penja Peppercorn Beef Jus \n- My bf had this one. I tasted the filet and it melted like butter in my mouth. It was cooked to perfection. They had a little play of a fried egg on top with the turnips and potatoes. It was a nice surprise for him. \n\nMAINE LOBSTER & TAYLOR MUSSEL BEIGNETS HALF 1.5# BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER\n* Shellfish Mushrooms: Lobster, Abalone, Clamshell & Oyster Risotto Al Nero & Lobster Stuffed Ale Battered Mussels, Tarragon Meyer Lemon Aioli\n- The mussels on this dish were delicious! It wasn't expecting to like it all that much, but it was my favorite part of the dish. The risotto was a little undercooked and over salted, so I was not pleased. The abalone had a weird flavor to it and normally I'm a big fan. \n\nDessert: \nCHOCOLATE POT DE CREME\n* Flourless Chocolate Cake, Caramel Malt Syrup, Guinness Meringue, Milk Chocolate Lace, Malted Ice Cream  \n- My bf had this and I was completely jealous. I wanted to steal this from him. The malted ice cream was really interesting and gave a different texture to the ice cream. The cake was delicious. I'm a huge fan of dessert and I only got a bite of this, I'd go back just for this. \n\nSTICKY TOFFEE SUNDAE\n* Medjool Date Cake, English Toffee, Toasted Almond Ice Cream, Hot Fudge\n Buttered Pecans \n- Can't complain about my dessert though, it was really tasty and literally a sticky dessert. It was a little sweet after awhile though, so I couldn't finish it. \n\nSERVICE\nThis is where I'm completely peeved. The service should be more or less on point, but it wasn't. We waited over 25 minutes just for our starters. Our waiter barely came by our table. Having empty drinks on the table is not acceptable if we're paying for food and service. No apology, just glazed over it like it was normal. We were right in front of the main service pass. You could tell the kitchen was backed up, so I'm sure that the starter's pass was just as backed up, but that doesn't mean you can't come by the table to check on your guests. \n\nThe food was good, the service was not. It's one of those places where I'll cross it off my list and it'd be lucky for me to ever return. Although, that chocolate pot de creme is a good temptation to lure me back, that memory of the service slaps me back to reality.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-11-12"}, {"excerpts": ["* Seared Sea Scallops\n"], "author": "Julia K.", "review": "Lucky enough to have our boss take our group here for lunch as a holiday treat!\nYay for corporate cards!

All were very good, especially the tuna tartare. The nori chips made all the difference in the world.\n\nWe each ordered the Soup of the Day, which happened to be a lobster bisque. The only comment I have is that I wish there were some pieces of lobster in it. However it was still rich and we were definitely given a good amount. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the wood oven roasted Kobe Bavette. What is a bavette, you may wonder - because I wondered the exact same thing. I asked our server and he described it so well that I just had to order it. Turned out to be sliced medallions of tender Kobe Beef. It cut like butter and melted in my mouth like butter. Absolutely delicious. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the chocolate Buche de Noel in celebration to the holiday. Very sweet, very rich, and very chocolatey.

You can make a reservation on Open Table, and if Open Table doesn't have the times you want, you can call them, and they'll most likely be able to accommodate you (read: not very crowded).
