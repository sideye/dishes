I am one of those obnoxious Peruvians that when they go to a Peruvian restaurant, nothing really satisfy them. Comments like 'this doesn't do justice to the real thing' or 'not the same' are not uncommon. If they don't say it out loud, they are definitely thinking it. \n\nHaving said that, Piqueos is amazing. It is the real thing and the mix of many different and rich flavours are definitely noticed here. Yes, like home!\n\nWe started by ordering a couple of glasses of wine. One tempranillo and one malbec. Usually when one goes to a restaurant, you can tell where the owner is making his money. Mediocre wine that you can tell you can buy the whole bottle for the price of one glass. While probably the economics of the wine we drank was the same at Piqueos, the quality of the wine was a lot better than the average. One can tell they spent a lot of time selecting them and both were very distinctive and complex with long lasting taste. The wine selection was just a nice introduction to de dedication to details I noticed to the whole dining experience. \n\nAs for the food, some general comments. Piqueos is closer to a tapas bar than to a large meal restaurant. The have a long selection and the good news is that even though it is tapas, the portions are not in miniature like other tapas bars I have visited. \n\nWe had a Quinoa salad that was really good. Each of the ingredients were super fresh and it had a semi sweet balsamic that made it delicious. \n\nWe also had the grilled hongos that cooked perfectly, which were accompanied by some arugula and a tartar sauce (similar to a mayonnaise but better). \n\nThe scallops were amazing. Grilled and not overcooked, just tender and tasty as they should be on a bed of lentils that added flavour to the dish without overpowering.  \n\nWe tried the Teque\u00f1os with avocado as well. It is a rather simple dish, but every time I try it, they always mess it up because people tend to make them in a hurry. I asked for them not for the flavour but as a point of comparison with other restaurants. That was not the case in Piqueos and I liked them a lot because they literally brought me childhood memories. That reinforced my belief that the staff at Piqueos are really paying attention to all the details. \n\nThe baby octopus was fantastic. Not too chewy, not too hard. They were just right and they are served with a fantastic sauce inspired in the anticuchos one can find in Lima. \n\nThe last dish was a corn cake, which was made with choclo grains (Peruvian corn), potato and cheese. Really memorable. \n\nAll in all a really good experience and I will be coming back to try the rest of the dishes in the menu.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Also good - the Quinoa salad, the short ribs, and the Bolitas de Yucca.

However I left Piqueo's with a full belly, a smile on my face, and a few extra dollars in my pocket with the coupon from Bloomspot. One caveat...service was slow as a slug and many plates randomly arrive with no consistent timing between each so at one point we had too many dishes at the table and at another the table sat empty while we waited for our last dish which in fact should have been the easiest to prepare.\n\nAnyhow...the food...\n\nCebiche Mixto - Good. Pretty much on-par with the ceviches served at every other Peruvian restaurant on the planet. I love all the crispy elements of the dish.\n\nAnticucho de Coraz\u00f3n - Extremely tender (sign that they treated this normal tough muscle just right) with a really nice smokey sauce but perhaps a bit on the tart side\n\nCrab Cake Peruano - Not really worth $16, but a really well presented dish. The potato chip crust didn't sound particularly appetizing but I was so very wrong as it added both great texture and flavor.\n\nQuesadilla de Pato - My favorite dish of the night. I'm a sucker for duck confit and this quesadilla was filled to the edges with succulent duck meat.\n\nShort Ribs (Stew) - I'm also a sucker for braised short ribs. Nothing really Peruvian about this dish although it did have a great green sauce (perhaps cilantro-based) that added a nice freshness and lightness to a dish that ultimately boils down to meat and potatoes...yum...\n\nClasico Paella - One of the better paella dishes that I've had and they definitely did not skimp on the seafood.\n\nAll in all, I'll definitely come back.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["The oyster in the Cebiche Mixto was overdone.

The fish was perfect, tender and full of flavor!  Let the snapper marinate in your mouth before chewing on it...definitely a \"moment\"!

Piqueo's brings a bit downtown aura to this area.\n\nThis restaurant labels itself as a tapas place but the portions are actually pretty generous. The menu is dizzyingly extensive, with probably about 40 dishes being offered from appetizers, tapas plates, entrees, sides, salads, etc.  Given the offerings on the menu, it took us awhile to choose. Also, quite a few tweaks are needed on the chef's part taste-wise. The presentation looks nice on the plate, albeit heavy handed on the sauces. \n\nI was excited to start the evening with a nice chilled glass of sangria.  Fruity enough for my taste, but at $8 a glass, I was only given a half full one.  (or half-empty, you decide). Either way, I was not pleased with the serving.\n\nThe complimentary fried chickpeas is # 82 on the Big Eats SF list. Crunchy chickpeas mixed with white corn, salty feta, finely chopped red onions and lime. You won't miss bread and butter with this healthy starter.\n\nThe ceviche mixto ($16) had mussels, octopus, shrimp and halibut, served with white corn and roasted sweet pepper on the side. The lime juice and red onions make for a sour-slightly spicy taste that I liked. Ingredients were fresh but for really good ceviche, try La Mar. \n\nThe grilled NY steak ($28) needed more seasoning. It was also tough to cut and the adobo sauce it was served on was lackluster. \n\nThe fried plantains ($6) were sauteed in brown sugar and butter, topped with powdered sugar. This is more soft than crispy but still good.\n\nI was curious about the Tequenos ($12) which is pastry dough filled with shrimp and mozz cheese, fried and topped with powdered sugar and honey. Crispy and honestly, not too sweet, but you know what? the sauce they used on this was the exact same one for the next dish! Our empanditas de mi abuela were filled with slices of tender beef and melted cheese. Very good, but having this dish right after the tequenos, it kinda tasted the same. \n\nCamarones al ajo had succulent shrimp brimming with garlic flavor, thanks to the sofrito garlic paste it was cooked in.  Served with baguettes topped with mild salsa.\n\nThe duck quesadilla with goat cheese was probably the favorite of the night. At this point, we were already full, but I couldn't stop eating this!\n\nService was inconsistent but we didn't have to wait long for our dishes. Our waiter who started us off with our meal was probably on the end of his shift, he brought out the first couple of dishes and disappeared. A second server took over for him. But there wasn't any transition between the two which was kinda confusing.\n\nOverall, Piqueo's has room for improvements.

In our San Francisco \"adaptation\" of the Andes, you'll run into narrow a$$ streets and numerous one ways.  To the inexperienced eye, streets appear like spitting images of each other.  Electing to hike up from Mission Street will leave you sweaty en route to your destination resulting in wobbly legs.  The extra minutes driving in circles lost, like in my case, will be worth it.  \n\nPiqueo's is a Peruvian restaurant.  Very trendy and chic, all of things I don't really know much about.  Foolishly, I find myself gravitating towards this place.  Finally seeing the little sign on the corner restaurant, the trek felt like finding that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.     \n\n\"Any wine or sangria?\" the waitress asked.  Any normal person would order wine or sangria at a tapas BAR.  Oh no, not me.  I inquired about iced tea.  Our waitress probably thought \"You serious?\"  Since I'm a light weight (alcohol tolerance wise), I just stuck with water.  The sangria sounded good (next time!) when I looked over at the other table.  I could see myself bumper car-ring my way out of Bernal Heights drunk on sangria.  That wouldn't be good for my insurance.  \n\nWith so many tapas choices, we only chose one, the papa rellena.  Think an egg fashioned deep fried potato ball with meat inside.  Sitting in a decorative pond of mole-like green sauce, it was accompanied with a mix of greens and salsa.  Meat on the inside kept the potato from being too dry as the surrounding sauce also became an excellent dip.  I wish we had another.  \n\nIf our main dishes weren't as good, I would have regretted not getting more tapas.  With meat on our minds, we got the lomito al jugo and the churrasco.  The lomito al jugo (their lomo saltado) is loaded with chunks of beef tenderloin topped with skinny fries with a yellow drizzly sauce carried a soy sauce flavor light accented in the meat.  What's churrasco?  I don't know, but apparently, it's what they coin as a New York steak.  It was perfectly cooked medium upon request.  Picture this: meat so clean, a butter knife could cut through it.  Those yucca fries partnered with the steak weren't too bad themselves.  Smothered in very decorative and delectable sauces, it was an ideal starch to the meat.      \n\nPiqueo's modern picture of Peruvian food is a framework masterpiece.

It was rich, thick, and had an overpowering taste of mushroom and potato that just had me wanting more and more.  It could be that my love for mushrooms and potatoes superseded an unbiased thought from me, but who cares.  It tasted good to me!\n\nMy table was later introduced to the Beef Empanada Peruana, Cebiche Mixto, and Churrasco A La Parilla.  The beef empanada was good.  The outer crust was crunchy.  The beef was tender and hinted a bit of sweetness in it that reminded me of my grandmother's empanadas from long ago.  The Cebiche Mixto was extraordinary.  And, the Churrasco A La Parilla was classic.  The strip of beef was just done perfectly and the yucca fries that came with it were just incredible.\n\nWe were later given a complimentary order of Pulpito Bebe that we humbly accepted.

That gesture of kindness though led us to loosen our belts just a little as the meal progressed.\n\nWe finished our meal with the Chicharronnes De Pollo and Calamar Relleno.  The Calamar Relleno is a giant squid filled with Spanish chorizo.  I'm not a big fan of giant squids.  They usually taste rubbery and tough to me.  Fortunately, Piqueo's delivered something pretty edible that tasted decent.  I don't know how we did it, as stuffed as we were, but we managed to finish a flavorful Chicharronnes De Pollo.  It had a bit of kick to it, I have to admit.  It could have knocked me out since I was so full.\n\nAs full as the three of us were, we still managed to share a dessert, the Suspiro A La Limena.  It was nothing original but it tasted wonderful.\n\nPiqueo's, to me, is what small San Francisco restaurants have always been - an intense environment that caters to adventurous palates.

Piqueo's brings a bit downtown aura to this area.\n\nThis restaurant labels itself as a tapas place but the portions are actually pretty generous. The menu is dizzyingly extensive, with probably about 40 dishes being offered from appetizers, tapas plates, entrees, sides, salads, etc.  Given the offerings on the menu, it took us awhile to choose. Also, quite a few tweaks are needed on the chef's part taste-wise. The presentation looks nice on the plate, albeit heavy handed on the sauces. \n\nI was excited to start the evening with a nice chilled glass of sangria.  Fruity enough for my taste, but at $8 a glass, I was only given a half full one.  (or half-empty, you decide). Either way, I was not pleased with the serving.\n\nThe complimentary fried chickpeas is # 82 on the Big Eats SF list. Crunchy chickpeas mixed with white corn, salty feta, finely chopped red onions and lime. You won't miss bread and butter with this healthy starter.\n\nThe ceviche mixto ($16) had mussels, octopus, shrimp and halibut, served with white corn and roasted sweet pepper on the side. The lime juice and red onions make for a sour-slightly spicy taste that I liked. Ingredients were fresh but for really good ceviche, try La Mar. \n\nThe grilled NY steak ($28) needed more seasoning. It was also tough to cut and the adobo sauce it was served on was lackluster. \n\nThe fried plantains ($6) were sauteed in brown sugar and butter, topped with powdered sugar. This is more soft than crispy but still good.\n\nI was curious about the Tequenos ($12) which is pastry dough filled with shrimp and mozz cheese, fried and topped with powdered sugar and honey. Crispy and honestly, not too sweet, but you know what? the sauce they used on this was the exact same one for the next dish! Our empanditas de mi abuela were filled with slices of tender beef and melted cheese. Very good, but having this dish right after the tequenos, it kinda tasted the same. \n\nCamarones al ajo had succulent shrimp brimming with garlic flavor, thanks to the sofrito garlic paste it was cooked in.  Served with baguettes topped with mild salsa.\n\nThe duck quesadilla with goat cheese was probably the favorite of the night. At this point, we were already full, but I couldn't stop eating this!\n\nService was inconsistent but we didn't have to wait long for our dishes. Our waiter who started us off with our meal was probably on the end of his shift, he brought out the first couple of dishes and disappeared. A second server took over for him.

I felt they could've given us that table or the tables could've been separated and we could've sat in the main dining area; however, the server decided to put us in the back room, literally!!!!! The back room I believe was intended solely as a work station, but they decided to had a few tables to increase the capacity. Our table for 2 was right next to the wine station, in fact, I sat about a foot away from the wine refrigerator. I was really concerned if they wanted to get wine, it would be a bump and grind moment, and it would be quite disruptive and intrusive to our dining experience. However, when one of the wait staff got some wine and got closer to us than we wanted him to be, it wasn't too bad, but annoying none-the-less. In the small back room there were tables for 7 people: 2-doubles and 1 for four, we were the only ones there, after one patron left. We sat directly under the speakers, and the music was so loud we had to ask them to turn it down! I'm thinking maybe those speakers were meant for the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, this was not a good start nor was it a good first impression!\n\nOK, for a start we got some wine, me a chardonnay and my companion a red, which he claimed was pretty good. We shared an appetizer of octopus. OMG, it was like chewing on rubber bands, and atop a starchy mushy concoction of potatoes. And, to top it off it was charred, I'm being polite, it was burnt!  Again, not a good start.\n\nFor our main course I got the pork in an adobo sauce and my companion got the lamb.

Slightly spicy with shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and fish.\n\nDessert\nSuspiro a la Lime\u00f1a...\ndulce de leche with pisco whipped cream\n\nI will definitely be back to this restaurant.

The restaurant is small, but the atmosphere is cozy yet modern; a perfect setting for sharing tapas with your loved ones.  \n\nWe got acquainted with this restaurant after purchasing an Open Table certificate for half off.  We ordered a variety of items from the menu to share: ceviche mixto, ahi ceviche, bolitas de yucca, and 2 specials of the evening: a \"surf and turf\" and the paella negra.  Everything was delicious, with a few caveats:  there was a lot of large raw onion chunks in many of the dishes we ordered.  I actually quite like the taste of raw onion, but even I felt it was overboard, particularly in the ceviches and the paella.  The ceviches were bright and flavorful, but lacked a bit of panache it terms of knife skills and presentation for the fish (compared to La Mar's ceviches).  The bolitas de yucca were these wonderful fried balls filled with love and came with a sauce that will make you lick the plate.  In other words, GET THESE!!!  The squid-ink based paella was generously packed with assorted seafood.  The steak and scallops of the surf and turf dish were grilled perfectly (so tender but with a nice char).  We ordered a cava cocktail with chicha morada to accompany our tapas, but unfortunately I found the cocktail to be too sweet.\n\nWe finished the meal with 2 heavenly desserts:  the chocolate lava cake with pisco ice cream and the \"Suspiro a la Lime\u00f1a\" (Dulce de Leche with pisco whipped cream).  According to another Yelper, \"Suspiro a la Lime\u00f1a\" means \"sigh of a woman from Lima\" and how can you not be absolutely tickled by that?  The custard was dense and rich and much like a (satisfied) sigh of woman (from Lima or any other place).  \n\nService was attentive, but a bit slow at times.  All in all, we had a good experience at Piqueo's and will return to try other items on the menu.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-04-19"}]}
