Annoying patrons, crappy beer/wine list, bad neighborhood, ugly bartender...you name it. Yet Fly has surpassed even this critic's sharpest eye and come out on top. Bravo, Fly, you've topped my list. 'Why?' you ask?\n\nFor one, they serve Poppy Jasper. For those of you not in the know, this is hands down the tastiest microbrew around, yet can only be found at a few establishments (Zeitgeist for one) in town. This was the original reason I kept coming back time and again...that, and the fact it's two blocks from my house. But I digress. Poppy Jasper accounts for at least ONE of these stars.\n\nThen there's the menu. I've yet to order anything I don't like (and at this point, I've pretty much made it through the whole menu). The Black Forest Ham and Brie sandwich is a delight, as are these \"salads on top of pizzas\" whatever-they-call-'ems. YUM. That's star TWO.\n\nDecor adds the third star; I believe this is owned by the same people that own Solstice and Brick, yet any and all possible pretension is removed leaving behind a cozy, neighborhood feel. The series of paintings hung high on the wall are unique and eye-catching, and the hanging paper lanterns over the pool table (always in use, but somehow unobtrusive) create a warm, inviting light to the venue. \n\nAt this point you'd start looking for flaws and might turn to the service to find one, except this is NOT the case. The bartenders are prompt, attentive and friendly despite usually being slammed, and the servers demonstrate the same attention to their customers. Even on nights when there's a waiting list for seating, they are patient and kind and when you DO get seated, will make sure that you always have a full beer and aren't lacking for grub. The fourth star is well-deserved for this.\n\nAs for star five, I'll admit it: it's the location. One block down from The Independent (and two from my house), it's many a night when I walk in and see friends among the many patrons at Fly. In fact, it's become our local watering hole, mainly for the reasons listed above but also for that genuine feel of camaraderie and the fact that, after a long night and a full tummy, we can stumble home easily without incident.

The price was right too (wink, wink).\n\n***Update Feb 9 2008; Over the Christmas break Fly got a little face lift. It's a little roomier with a newly designed bar. New beers include Anderson Valley's Brother David's Double and Speakeasy's Hunter's Point Porter.

This bar/restaurant is one of the friendliest and most accessible bars along Divisadero in the NOPA neighborhood. It's never too crowded and you can almost always get a table. \n\nThe best time to go, however, is during Happy Hour, which operates daily from 3:30-6:30 pm. Pizzas are offered at half price. I always get the Carmel Blue pizza, a perfect blend of Gorgonzola and Mozzarella cheese with caramelized onions on a light garlic and olive oil sauce.  I'm salivating as I think about it... For an extra bonus, I add prosciutto for an extra $1.... heaven. \n\nI also highly recommend the la tortilla salad and the chicken & goat cheese quesadilla. Really though, I have never ordered anything from the menu that I didn't love.\n\nThe atmosphere at Fly Bar is extremely relaxing. The bar acts as a gallery for local artists and it always switching up the artwork and installations hanging on the walls. I have yet to buy a piece, but I have my eye on a piece from the current installation of wax and watercolor art. Fabulous. There is also a pool table in the back of the bar, and people are always willing to team up or start a tournament. \n\nI only have one problem with the bar, but it's a big enough problem to take one star down from the rating: there is no hard alcohol. Fly Bar only serves Beer (both draft and bottled), sake, and soku (a very sweet Japanese vodka) drinks.
