I would give this place ZERO STARS if possible. Between the restaurant layout, the food, and especially the service, this IS ABSOLUTELY the WORST dining experience I have ever had...\n\n1. Didn't know where to order or pay\nThe only indicator of where this restaurant's overhead menu is is Frowny McFrownster (FMcF) half waving at the confused would-be (but shouldn't-be) customers. (Is she saying 'hi' to me? Is she telling me to go away? Oh, she's telling me the menu is in the way back where she's standing!) Even then, the menu was shrouded behind cooking vents in the furthest corner of the restaurant, and had more pages than there were TV screens - a perfect example of where technology does more harm than good. (Wait... still can't find the menu. Oh! There it is! I think I want the burrito, no, the nachos, no the tacos, wait... what were my options again? I guess I'll wait for the slide show to start again...)\n\n2. Soggy flavorless food\nI ordered the nachos, because you can never mess up nachos, right?! WRONG. There were not enough (stale Costco) chips. There was but one layer of sad (not toasted) chips, struggling under the weight of the watery beans and chicken (and NO CHEESE). \nMy meal was so sadly flavorless, the food was crying, and the only thing to mop its tears were the thin layer of tortilla chips. \nI tried so hard to comfort my sad meal, my natural solution was to ask for more more chips! (Chips are usually free for dine-in Mexican places any how, right? Besides they're at the counter, with tongs, and bags, within arms reach of the customer). So I go inside for more chips and FMcF immediately snaps at me \"THEY'RE NOT FREE\". So I give my eye-rolling server the $1.10 for the small bag of chips, which contained just as many chips as my original $12 plate of sorrowful nachos did.\n\n3. Found hair in my food - correction: HAIRS\nMy boyfriend says I have a special talent for finding hairs in my food. I think he's a little embarrassed at how often I complain about it. Well... today was one of those days. Once I sat down with the new bag of chips, I dipped into my nachos and... pulled a hair out! It was buried quite deep, but was short and blonde. (FMcF had long black hair. Let's give FMcF the benefit of the doubt and not make this dining experience any worse.) So I picked out the hair and tossed the contaminated bite to the dog. When I finally mustered the strength for a second bite... I found a SECOND HAIR. A SECOND HAIR BURIED EVEN DEEPER THAN THE FIRST.  I presented my furry dish to FMcF, expressing my distaste.  She initially refused to believe me, insisting she didn't see it. Then she offered \"MAYBE IT WAS ON THE FORK\". I showed her the hair was buried, I insisted this was the second one I found in my dish, and get this, FMcF said \"YEAH I GET IT. YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPLAIN.. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO... REMAKE IT?\" First of all, the hair was definitely embedded in the food. Second of all, why would hair growing on your forks be any better? Hair should not be floating around (or be buried) in the food you serve. \n\nIn the end, I was too upset to wait for them to remake my nachos, especially after being asked detailed questions about what I ordered (sorry, not sorry, but I was upset enough as it was and FMcF could have safely deduced my order by looking at my untouched plate). I walked away. My only regret is not asking for a refund first. Actually, my regret is not taking a hint from the lack of traffic and making the mistake of walking into El B*tch Burrito at all!\n\nIN CONCLUSION. Do not mistake this places's cleanliness for godliness. The fact this place LOOKS clean is because there's no mess to pick up! People aren't going here because they don't want  Mexican food by the beach. They aren't coming here because no one likes Mexican food that tastes more flavorless than the cafeteria lady's leftover surprise.

I mean you're a few blocks from a street called 'La Playa', not much of a stretch... \n\nSo the first few times either of us went there went without a hitch, but the last time I went there, which will be the last time I ever go there, was pretty bad. I went up there with my buddy and walked into an empty restaurant. There was a woman in an apron, who I later found out was the owner, sitting at the front with a friend. I saw the line cook or whatever you want to call him back at sink washing some beef. I got to counter to order. He immediately came over took of a glove to handle the pen, and started to take my order. One of the few things I can do in spanish, is order a burrito, I find it usually helps get my order right. So I ordered, minding that he still had one of his raw meat gloves on, and he proceeded to put on one new glove and then pick up my tortilla WITH THE RAW MEAT GLOVE! \n\nNow I by no means am a germaphobe, but come on, especially right in front of my, that's obscene. So, once again in spanish, I politely asked him to change his gloves. As I was doing this the owner had walked over to take my friends order. I didn't notice, partially because she didn't get my attention, but apparently she gave me a pretty bad glare. The guy making my burrito was, nice and apologetic, he offered to get me a new burrito, and apologized which is all I ask for. A simple apology and remedy. As I am in the industry, that is one of the first things your learn. So he continued to make my burrito. As I was paying, the owner came up to ring me up. After I had paid, still with no acknowledgment from her, I brought up the issue, because maybe he didn't know. But  I know damn well she knows about health code, let alone common hygiene. \n\nI simply said, \"I'm not trying to be rude, and I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble, but you need to make sure he knows' (this is where she interrupts and informs me she's the owner) 'that if he is handling raw meat, he needs to at minimum change his gloves, if not wash his hands thoroughly.\" She barely acknowledged me, no \"sorry\", no \"thank you\", no comp or discount, almost the contrary.  I mean this was an egregious health code violation, for which I would have been well within my rights to throw a fit and even call the authorities. It just shows poor ownership/management ability, which is probably why she owns a flailing spot called \"El Beach Burrito\"... her loss because, my roommie and I each eat at least one burrito a week @ about $8 a pop, your looking at a minimum of about $1000/year lost revenue. At a place like that, that could make a difference. Plus none of my friends or guests, and all the people that decide not to go because of this, probably a much greater number. But whatever, her loss, in such a fickle industry she should work on the basics.\n\nFinal note: My roomies experience consisted of him getting there at 8:40, when the close at 9, and being immediately and very rudely greeted at the door by the same woman with a \"WE'RE CLOSED!\" I recommend a business that requires less human interaction lady!", "rating": 1, "date": "2010-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I get a veggie burrito on wheat tortilla for $7.45 and it's a lot of food.

You run an upscale spot in a upper class area. People don't want to be nickel and dimed for free chips otherwise elsewhere but they sure as hell dont want to find out the misleading and seemingly cheatfull formula you enforce to squeeze a dollar more from each so called valued customer.  My advice for what it's worth: is give people what they pay for at the very least. And if you want to stand out- make sure that your customer takes note of how generous the portions are. Establish a Rapport with your clientele and then you establish repeat business and free marketing when they blab to their friends how amazing their fav burrito spot is.  You should lower your own pay and give your workers a raise for dealing with insightful shoppers who feel cheated, because apparently Elvira told us that unfortunately those kinds of complaints happen on the daily.

Apparently it is not very popular.\n\nThe front door was wide open and some black birds flew in.  One of the help had to grab one that was fluttering by the window and tossed it out. Of course, a bunch of its feathers drifted into the restaurant. They didn't bother closing the door which seemed like a no-brainer. The music was turned up way too loud and apparently was meant for the enjoyment of the staff and not the customers.  It was very distracting.\n\nThe cashier, a heavy set Hispanic woman, didn't appear to enjoy customers and was unfriendly.  She reminded us of a mannequin in a Halloween mask.  She is definitely a negative impact to this place.\n\nIt is unlikely that we will return here.  I would rather go to Chevy's - at least the staff has better customer service skills and the food is warm.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-04-03"}, {"excerpts": ["I can lie to myself and say that by walking there and back I am burning off some of the calories in a super burrito.

Between the restaurant layout, the food, and especially the service, this IS ABSOLUTELY the WORST dining experience I have ever had...\n\n1. Didn't know where to order or pay\nThe only indicator of where this restaurant's overhead menu is is Frowny McFrownster (FMcF) half waving at the confused would-be (but shouldn't-be) customers. (Is she saying 'hi' to me? Is she telling me to go away? Oh, she's telling me the menu is in the way back where she's standing!) Even then, the menu was shrouded behind cooking vents in the furthest corner of the restaurant, and had more pages than there were TV screens - a perfect example of where technology does more harm than good. (Wait... still can't find the menu. Oh! There it is! I think I want the burrito, no, the nachos, no the tacos, wait... what were my options again? I guess I'll wait for the slide show to start again...)\n\n2. Soggy flavorless food\nI ordered the nachos, because you can never mess up nachos, right?! WRONG. There were not enough (stale Costco) chips. There was but one layer of sad (not toasted) chips, struggling under the weight of the watery beans and chicken (and NO CHEESE). \nMy meal was so sadly flavorless, the food was crying, and the only thing to mop its tears were the thin layer of tortilla chips. \nI tried so hard to comfort my sad meal, my natural solution was to ask for more more chips! (Chips are usually free for dine-in Mexican places any how, right? Besides they're at the counter, with tongs, and bags, within arms reach of the customer). So I go inside for more chips and FMcF immediately snaps at me \"THEY'RE NOT FREE\". So I give my eye-rolling server the $1.10 for the small bag of chips, which contained just as many chips as my original $12 plate of sorrowful nachos did.\n\n3. Found hair in my food - correction: HAIRS\nMy boyfriend says I have a special talent for finding hairs in my food. I think he's a little embarrassed at how often I complain about it. Well... today was one of those days. Once I sat down with the new bag of chips, I dipped into my nachos and... pulled a hair out! It was buried quite deep, but was short and blonde. (FMcF had long black hair. Let's give FMcF the benefit of the doubt and not make this dining experience any worse.) So I picked out the hair and tossed the contaminated bite to the dog. When I finally mustered the strength for a second bite... I found a SECOND HAIR. A SECOND HAIR BURIED EVEN DEEPER THAN THE FIRST.  I presented my furry dish to FMcF, expressing my distaste.  She initially refused to believe me, insisting she didn't see it. Then she offered \"MAYBE IT WAS ON THE FORK\". I showed her the hair was buried, I insisted this was the second one I found in my dish, and get this, FMcF said \"YEAH I GET IT. YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPLAIN.. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO... REMAKE IT?\" First of all, the hair was definitely embedded in the food. Second of all, why would hair growing on your forks be any better? Hair should not be floating around (or be buried) in the food you serve. \n\nIn the end, I was too upset to wait for them to remake my nachos, especially after being asked detailed questions about what I ordered (sorry, not sorry, but I was upset enough as it was and FMcF could have safely deduced my order by looking at my untouched plate).

Get off my back you judgmental avocado snobs), and I got home to find a rather large dollop of it smeared strategically mid-burrito. There are like five ingredients in a burrito and I saw them write down \"no guac\" when I said it. I was literally the only person in line at the time, busyness was a non-factor. I suppose I should be congratulating them for fucking up something so difficult to fuck up. Congrats, El Beach Burrito (do they really need the \"El\" in their name?).\n\nAlso the roll of the burrito was poorly executed. Way too loose, which left the burrito with a huge lengthwise crack running down it where the two sides of the tortilla didn't meet. All the juices from the chicken/beans/salsa ran out of the crack, and the result was me trying to eat something akin to a large wet bag. A pretty tasty bag though, I will concede. Kind of shitty horchata, the second half of the cup was really gritty like they actually made it AT the beach.
