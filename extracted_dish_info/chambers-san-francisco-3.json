So hidden that finding it is a little confusing - the entrance is on Eddy St through the brown double doors. Chambers has a GORGEOUS inside... the ambiance is so chic and modern with walls divided by shelves of records. There's even that \"BE AMAZING\" sign at the bar which seems iconic to this place. This is a nice place in Tenderloin for a romantic and intimate date.\n\nToo bad they sat us OUTSIDE despite having reservations. I was pretty peeved when I found out later that they had 2 reservation systems, and for that particular night there were a lot of conflicts in the system for bookings. I really would have loved to sit inside and enjoy the decor... but had to settle for a heated outdoor patio next to the pool. Don't get me wrong - the pool at Phoenix Hotel is gorgeous, but our view wasn't so great since they had put down wall drapes in the patio wall. So we could see the pool through a plastic screen. On the bright side, it was quieter so I could hear my partner better, but it also made for a kind of eeriness.\n\nAside from that slight oversight, the food is geared towards Asian fusion and is pretty damn good. We had a Gilt City voucher for a $150 dining credit (paid $80), so we ordered a bunch of small plates to try a variety. Our server was nice enough to space them out like courses, thus we had the following:\n\n- Sizzling Kobe Tri-Tip ($16): THIS WAS DELICIOUS... ~6 slices of kobe beef still cooking on a sizzling stone. I like my meat medium rare, so it was nice to control that. Because the beef is already sliced, you can taste the delicious meat juices at full capacity without cutting into it. Honestly the yuzu-soy sauce did nothing for this meat - it was delicious on its own. So delicious that we ordered it twice since the portion is pretty tiny.\n\n- Pancetta Wrapped Dates ($9): I had high hopes for this, but at the end of the day it was lackluster. It wasn't bad... but it tasted so generic. I would've been fine with just bacon wrapped dates from Starbuck's late night menu. I would pass as you're paying $3 per skewer.\n\n- Oyster Bao Bun ($12): These were surprisingly good! Oysters crispy and bao was fluffy/tasty on its own. The remoulade sauce and tabasco gave it a nice Creole kick. It was an interesting combination of Creole + Asian flavors. Too bad the portion was quite small (3 per serving), but we ordered 2 of these anyways. \n\n- Potato Gnocchi ($14): Sauce and mushrooms were on-point. The gnocchi itself is kind of soggy - still tasty, but I expect a bit of bite and chewiness in my gnocchi.\n\n- Crispy Pork Belly ($15): Honestly this was disappointing - not only is it expensive for the portion, it's not very crispy and the texture of the soft fat is kind of unappealing. Flavor wise it was kind of all over the place with the fig chutney and bacon sherry sauce - it just didn't go well together.\n\n- Fried Brussel Sprouts ($8): 2nd best thing we had that night... the portion surprised us because it was so big compared to the rest of the dishes! The brussel sprouts are flash fried so they get that really nice char flavor. Tossed with the Gochujang sauce, you get a nice Korean spice that goes well with the savory Parmesan cheese. This was well worth the price.\n\n- Alive ($12): Cucumber, mint, agave, and vodka - what's not to like? It was a refreshing drink that paired well with all the savory items I had. I prefer my drinks on the sweeter side, but this had a good balance of being strong and sweet.\n\nThey also have non-alcoholic cocktails for designated drivers... unfortunately I couldn't remember the names of them, but my companion had a carrot juice + yuzu cocktail that they seemed to enjoy, It certainly looked like a cocktail - way to make those designated drivers not feel left out.\n\nOverall... good food and great ambiance (assuming you sit outside in the winter and not in the covered patio). It's kind of an oasis in gritty neighborhood of Tenderloin (BTW, just take an Uber here as the area was super sketch at night). Portions are small and pricey, but if you come here with a discounted voucher or only want drinks with a few bites (Kobe Tri-Tip and brussel sprouts), then it's well worth it IMO.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-02-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Dungeness Crab Cakes, Fried Brussel Sprouts, Beet Salad, Chambers Burger, and the Apple Tart.

We were impressed by the thematic decor and the quality of food, but disappointed by the noise of the happy hour. The bar for happy hour is right next to most of the tables they were utilizing to seat those who had come for dinner. In contrast, the back bar with the beautiful \"Be Amazing\" sign was empty except for a few employees or hotel guests. I didn't understand why everyone was crammed into the front, underutilizing the space the restaurant had. Spending the first part of dinner shouting over people seeing how many Oceans they could guzzle down before seven was unpleasant. It was also strange to me that while we sat 25 feet from the bar, we couldn't order happy hour drinks. Would they have preferred we bought simple bar dishes instead of an entire meal to qualify for a dollar or two off a cocktail? It seems like a poor strategy, but that's just my opinion. \nThe decor of the restaurant is trendy and interesting. It's amusing to see how many records you can recognize on the shelves and snapping a shot in front of the \"Be Amazing\" sign is a must do for an trendy visitor to Chambers.

Not too far of a walk from the BART (which is good cause parking isn't fun).\n\nDuring our first visit we got 2 cocktails and a freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Food during brunch was more on the average side. We got a burger, an egg scramble, and a pork belly dish. They were all (3.25-3.5 stars) with the pork belly dish being the most flavorful. It was a sizeable and rich piece but not quite enough for the price. For once the cocktails were better than the food.\n\nDuring my second visit we got the following:\n1) Pork Belly w/ Ravioli (small plate): My favorite plate of the night.

Slightly larger portion than a lot of the other items. Looked very juicy and she enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, my experiences here have been great.

My sister made a reservation for about eight of us and we were promptly seated upon arrival. \n\nThe exterior of the restaurant looked like a giant black, windowless box. Thankfully there was a sign next to the restaurant that read \"Chambers\" because we would have definitely missed the place without it. The interior, however, was much more decorative, with beautiful tables and chairs, low warm lighting, and a cozy atmosphere. \n\nWe had a couple of people waiting on us and the service was alright, nothing special. There wasn't anything that particularly stood out. \n\nBecause we had such a large party, we ordered double of the following appetizers: foie gras, kobe beef, pork belly, and house fries. The kobe beef was served on a heated stone that seared the raw meat whilst on the table so that was pretty cool. The pork belly was very tender and tasted great. The foie gras was served with unagi, an interesting flavor that strangely worked well. As for the fries, they came out as giant rectangular cubes that had actual pieces of potato in them.  But we weren't too big of a fan of them since they were more on the bland side. \n\nBecause we were pretty full already, my hubby and I decided to split the Chamber burger with extra avocado. The bun was thinner than we expected, but instead of being crispy, it just tasted like flat bread. The patty was cooked and flavored well though. The side of fries was typical, but we did like the fresh herbs in it. \n\nThen finally for dessert, we ordered the coffee cake. While I understand that typical coffee cake has a crumbly surface, the entire piece of cake was barely holding it together, eliciting a rough texture. It did, however, come with a side of ice cream and honey lavender meringue which softened the cake up just a tad. But the combination of the cake, meringue, and ice cream quickly transformed the dessert to a sickly sweet dish. \n\nSo for the kind of food we got and for the amount, we have to say that Chambers is a little too pricey.

From the drinks to the apps to the entrees! My only advice would be to skip the pork belly add-on for the burger; it's not the same as the appetizer and not worth the +$3. But definitely get the appetizer pork belly! \n\nAs the night fell it seemed Chambers just got busier and busier. When we left around 9:30pm they were just setting up a DJ in the back.

I am thinking wtf... diner grub? or what... \n\nSo we stroll up to the front lobby and they have a sign that says go around the corner.  I am like WTH there aint no signs over there... but there is a non descript brown door on a brown building that is just about as flat and drab as anything you have ever seen... well lo and behold... you enter into a dungeon. The lighting is so low that I almost walked right into the hostess with the mostess podium as my eyes adjusted. Its almost like I need to be led into this place or given a flashlight outside to enter with... \n\nIs this brunch in the dark I am wondering? We are given the how dare you not have a reservation treatment and we may be able to accommodate you uncouth lowbrow guests outside on the veranda... so off we traipse to a semi open and decently lit location. YAY us!\n\nSo yeah I am not too pleased with this joint to start with and the condescending attitude or the feeling thereof was bad... I felt like telling them they can take their frisco 'tude and shove it. However once we sat down, we had a chill waitress who was pleasant and jovial. Disheartened that she was a vegan so its hard to get any kind of recommendations or taste info about many of the meals from her. Regardless we did and got our orders in. Half our party went in for the AYCD mimosas for $14 with purchase of an entr\u00e9e. \n\nWe got a ton of food in the end on our table. I definitely enjoyed mine. I got the biscuits and gravy with pork belly and made my own plane since the only other thing on the menu I could get was the burger and it didn't reach out and grab my interest as much.

I ordered more extra gravy because it was so good. \n\nMy friends ordered most everything on the menu and most liked their grub at least decently... it seemed the least liked item was the potatoes though. They had a coating that wasn't as tasty overall... also if you order the pancake souffl\u00e9 thing, be warned it takes 20 minutes to make it!!!\n\nThere is only metered street parking nearby so be forewarned if you are trying to come here at the wrong time.

The attached hotel hosted an art exhibit and there was a Gatsby themed party going on simultaneously so the place was rocking.

The hibiscus drink was just right, with the right amount of tartness.\n\nWe shared the chicken liver pate, smoked pork belly and sizzling kobe tri-tip. The live pate was divine! It didn't taste organ-y and had a wonderful port flavor. I couldn't taste the leeks, but I think the leeks were cooked down so much that it melted in with the pate. I can certainly detect a bit of sweetness in the pate that's most likely from the leeks.I would order that again. \n\nThe smoked pork belly was disappointing. I expected it to be more buttery, but it seemed to be blanched and sliced up pork belly sitting on some wood chips. Granted, the presentation was great and the house made kimchi (more like pickled cabbage and less kimchi) gave the dish some kick, but it couldn't salvage the blandness of the pork.\n\nThe sizzling tri-tip was another winner, even though the serving size was tiny. The meat was so tender. There was a nice little slaw and dipping sauce that came with the dish, but I could just eat the meat plain because it was such a nice cut and so flavorful.I wish they would have an entree sized portion!\n\nThe burger was very good, too. The patty was juicy and the onion jam gave it even more flavor. The challah bun had nice texture and soaked up any extra juice from the meat.

The design team definitely did an AMAZING transformation to the former Bambuddha Lounge. Chamber's vintage glam decor is super swanky and a place you would imagine to be in Hollywood or NYC; NOT in crackhead central that's for sure. Shelves of old records lined the walls in the main dining room giving you that feeling like you're dining in someone's living room. The lounge area has plushy sofas and ottomans perfect for mingling and having a drink. There's also a poolside patio with several cabanas and a fire feature. \n\nA live DJ comes in at 10 PM and currently plays Soul/Loungey music. There are 2 bars and drinks didn't seem to be a problem to get though we only stayed till 10:20 PM. Chamber's attracts the Marina-type crowd and Hipsters in the masses if that's your thing. Chambers is definitely a place to check out and start your night off but not a place I can spend the whole night at (I like to dance).  \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking; beware of street cleaning signs. This area is pretty sketchy at night, so I highly suggest taking a cab here instead.  \n\nAt the back bar, lighted bulbs spell out \"BE AMAZING\". LOVE IT!

From the outside this place looks sketchy... it is attached to the old Phoenix Hotel in the Tenderloin and the door is on the side of the building.

There weren't too many tables occupied but the front bar was surrounded by young looking professionals. \n\nThe menu is short, very short and prices are mediocre. Three of us ordered the Chambers Burger ($12) with pork belly (+$3). The only thing I've tried here is the Chambers Burger but I think it might be the best thing in the menu!

We also shared a delicious coffee cake, some French pressed coffee and each had a mimosa.  I was a little more adventurous and got their signature one which was seemed lighter in flavor.  \n\nOur sever was nice but not overly attentive even when patrons starting pouring in right after they opened.  \n\nOverall, a delicious meal but unfortunately we probably would not be coming back until the neighborhood cleaned itself up a bit.

We ordered sizzling kobe tri-tip, sizzling pork belly, tator tots, and butter lettuce salad. \n\nThe sizzling kobe tri-tip was AMAZING. The meat is brought out rare on a sizzling stone and you let it cook to your liking. Kind of like korean bbq but kind of not. It came with pickled veggies in slaw form and mushroom brandy reduction. I took a piece of meat, dabbed some mush-bran reduction on there, topped it off with some pickled veggies... perfection in a bite. \n\nThe sizzling pork belly was just as good but not as sizzling hot as the kobe tri-tip. It came with kimchi-like side that was just super fantastic. It tasted like white kimchi. \n\nThe tator tots are not the traditional tator tots. They kind of look like fat mozzarella sticks but also look like blocks of hash browns. Super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It came with pork remoulade and bacon dust (you have to mix it together yourself)..I didn't know what I was tasting... regular ketchup would have been just fine. \n\nThe butter lettuce salad was just ok. It's just a salad with champagne vinaigrette. The spiced walnuts tasted like candy.. they were made very well. \n\nI also had a sugar cane coke for $6..... seemed a little pricey but it was nice to have bubbles with sizzling meat. \n\nWe were still not totally full after all that.

And of course the toast points went well but needed more surface area.\n\n-New York Strip.  There were so many ingredients to this dish there's no way I'll remember them all.  They cut the steak up for you (they ended up undercooking this steak to a full rare), served it on thinly sliced caramellized potatoes, and with this massive mix of vegetables on the side.  Luckily both of us prefer rare to medium, so this was fine.\n\nWe went on a tuesday night, but the place was rather busy, and our entrees didn't come until about an hour after the appetizers.

This place is at the Phoenix Hotel in the Tenderloin, which as most people know, this part of town has a friendly and interesting diverse mix of people...so I do recommend cabbing it or walking with a group of people if you love walking. \n* Showed up around 6:00'ish, everything was pretty desolate outside.\n* But what I was told turned out to be true, opened the door and walked into Chambers...a different world completely.\n* This place is insanely unique.  Has a bit of a 50's/60's vibe.  It really took me back.  (I was born in the 80's).\n* It has a really fun vibe, good energy, etc.\n* Had reservations for a smaller group of friends.  We had heard great things about the burger.  So went with the following:\n\nChamber's Burger $13\nprather ranch beef, heirloom tomato, smoked red onion, wagon wheel cheese, whole grain aioli, butter lettuce, challah bun, savory thyme kennebec fries\n\nHad to add the following.  I was going all out:\nCrispy braised pork belly $3\nShaved avocado  $2.5\n\nFor drinks, went for the specialty cocktails, they seemed like they knew what they were doing:\n\nDrink #4:  Tequila Drink\ndon julio reposado, american honey liqueur, yellow chartreuse\n\nDrink #6  Cuba Libra\nflor de cana rum, sugar cane coke\n\nSo the verdict?  They didn't disappoint on anything.  Excellent all around. Oh and I have to mention the atmosphere again.  I just really love it.  They have a huge vinyl record collection that lines many of the walls on bookshelves.  I believe they play music from this collection, have someone DJ etc.  All around solid stuff.  \n\nSo I continued the casual conversation with friends, paid out and then transitioned over to the bar area to meet additional friends in our group that were arriving post dinner.  \n\nSo the bar area...just go check out the pictures on the website.  There is this \"amazing\" sign behind the bar.  Name another bar that has this.  I love it.  Again, a 60's or 70's era feel.  Or maybe 2045 depending if we come full circle, I don't know.  It's a killer bar, kinda loungy at the same time with couches and funky seating, DJ playing, cool staff of servers and bartenders.  Oh and then there is the outside by the pool.  I think I'm rambling now, just thinking about wanting to go back.\n\nI'm jumping to the end of my review now.  Go check it out.  It's highly recommended.  When I went here, it was a bit of a hidden find.  I've taken group of friends back multiple times.  I have noticed it has continually become a bit more crowded.  I hope it keeps that hidden find charm though.  That's what really made me love this place.  \n\nI will say they should remodel some of the outside courtyard area.  It's got a lot of potential, but the layout needs some work.  More fire pits and lions.  When that happens, I'm sure I can up this to five stars.

I stumbled to Chambers and it looked like a good place for the celebration. Since they open til 2am. I called around 11 something at night and tried to make a reservation. The guy I spoke to said since this is a large party, I had to talk to someone else who could help me make a dinner reservation and he will have that person call me back the next day. Next day, I received no call so I called back myself. They said they can accommodate us if we arrive at 6 and leave by 8pm, seating us in a private lounge area. I figured that since it is around the holidays, this is the best as it can get so I took the offer. Then later that day, I received another call from them, telling me that the party that was scheduled at 8 is coming in early and they don't want to rush us out early so they wanted to eat us outside to the outside common dining area, but had to break our party of 14 into group tables. I declined the new changes and decided to try the restaurant with just me and my boyfriend instead of the large party.\n\nWe made a reservation for a Saturday night for 7pm. A party of 2 is definitely a lot more easier to make a reservation for. We decided to arrive early to see if we can dine early. The entrance of the place was a little bit hard to find because there's no translucent window where you can look into the restaurant and there were no restaurant name at the door. We had to ask the front desk of their motel neighbor to find out the large wooden doors on Eddy St. leads you into Chambers. Once you get in, you're greeted by the host and the place looked empty with a few guests at the front bar. But the best bar is located at the inner part of the restaurant where a large \"BE AMAZING\" sign on the wall lights up in your face. We got seated next to the windows where you can look out to the courtyard that's shared with the motel next door, which includes their swimming pool (I wonder if Chamber guests can get access if they happen to wear swim suits), a fire pit, and a cabana. Our server was really nice and she constantly checked on us to see if we're having a good time. She also mention that since they have a full bar, they can customize any drink we want, we don't need to follow their drink menu.\n\nI ordered the braised oxtail ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Chamber burger along with the truffle dip chips to share. The truffle dip was good, I liked their chips and the dip was really flavorful. The ravioli was good too, but I'm having mix feelings about it because the ravioli was stuffed with the meat and it just seems like it's missing something. I can't really pin point what is wrong with the dish, but I'm placing my taste buds along the line of texture, it's missing some sort of textural palette to the dish. My boyfriend really enjoyed the fries that came with the burger, it reminded him of McDonald fries. The meat was cooked exactly how he wanted it and it has an intense charbroiled flavor to it.\n\nThe place definitely has more of a lounge vibe than a restaurant. It's dimly lighted and the whole place is filled with shelves of old record covers. Kind of an old hollywood feel with some modern touches around the place. The seats are covered with mismatch textiles with mainly wooden furniture. It's a long narrow space that stretches probably about half a block with compartmentlized spaces so there's a sense of separation between group dining/small party dining/bar. I liked the set up of the restaurant, but I think this place is better for drinks and small eats rather than a full dining experience.

Not too far of a walk from the BART (which is good cause parking isn't fun).\n\nDuring our first visit we got 2 cocktails and a freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Food during brunch was more on the average side. We got a burger, an egg scramble, and a pork belly dish. They were all (3.25-3.5 stars) with the pork belly dish being the most flavorful. It was a sizeable and rich piece but not quite enough for the price. For once the cocktails were better than the food.\n\nDuring my second visit we got the following:\n1) Pork Belly w/ Ravioli (small plate): My favorite plate of the night. Pork belly had a great fat to lean meat ratio. The lean meat was pretty tender and there was a ton of flavor from the delicious earthy and slightly sweet mushroom sauce. The ravioli was so light but so good. I want a whole bowl of them (4.75/5)\n\n2) Confit Octopus: So tender with mild flavors all working very well together then the chorizo and olives packing little punches while the butter beans helped mellow it back out. (4.5/5)\n\n3) Vegan dish of the day (Risotto): Friend's dish. It was underwhelming. Like a soupy rice congee where the kernels didn't disintegrate and with corn. Flavors were very bland (2/5)\n\n4) Market Fish: I believe it was king salmon. Friend's dish and it was quite small for the price but she said it tasted really good.\n\n5) Pork Chop: Friend's dish. Slightly larger portion than a lot of the other items. Looked very juicy and she enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, my experiences here have been great. In general I do find the portions a bit small for the price. I wouldn't say brunch is worth it but the flavors from the dinner dishes are (with the exception of the vegan risotto).

Walking in you get this warm and welcoming feeling, it's almost like rocker 70's vibe meets DJ.

If Lenny Kravitz were to build a Lounge/Restaurant, Chambers would be it, but maybe with shag carpeting over the hardwood floors.

We also had the artichoke hearts which had a great combination of flavors and textures and the last entree we shared was the pork tenderloin.
