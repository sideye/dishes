For a long time I have waited to check out this place. \n\nFirst off,, if planning for dinner before the live music starts @9:30pm w/cover charge, I would definitely plan for the dinner and somewhat of an early arrival, maybe around 8pm. \n\nParking can be a bit difficult to find on the streets but you can get lucky if your patient and there are a few paid parking lots for about $10 down the street. After walking in around 9pm, there was no one to greet us right away but the place was already starting to get full of people. Most of the tables were taken and luckily there was table left for us inside by the bar.\n\nAfter sitting down, someone eventually came to wait our table with a big smile and a warm welcome. At that point, more people started to fill the place up. We had ordered the Veggie Quesadillas,, Plantains,, and the Rissotto,, everything was delicious and just the right portion of servings. The non offensive $5 red wine was very light /smooth tasting and the pamergrita/mojito were also great too. everything came out to about $50, which is very reasonable for 2 people given the fact that the food/service  was outstanding. \n\nOh yeah,, we tried the honey flavored Cigar,, very smooth/great flavor/mild cigar with my glass of wine. \n\nJosh Jones Latin Jazz band was playing that night,, They were great,, one of the best Latin Jazz Bands I have seen in awhile,, there selection of music kept everyone dancing all night long. The dancing area is a bit small/ and be prepared to get bumped into if your out there but its all good and fun because everyone is having such a great time. And plus the band is right in front of you. \n\nThe outdoor area-patio is a great place to smoke your cigar/ cool off/ dance and enjoy other peoples company. Everyone we met there was friendly and talkative. To me this place kind of felt like being at home / having some good food/ listening and dancing to music/ making new friends/ and having a good time..\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this place for a great night of fun/ food/dinning/live music/dancing/networking/and just having a great time.

Rarely do you see shot glasses or Pabst here, so it definitely sophisticated in a way.  \n\nPool table in the back, and a outdoor fountain area with couches for you to smoke, so it was quite pleasant.  Too bad there wasn't some kind of music to make it nicer. \n\nI didn't try the food, but I got their Tears and Tequila drink.  It was very refreshing with all the cucumbers and spicy kick.  The rest of the crew had wine and imported beers, and they were pretty happy with the selection.\n\nThis is pretty much a more social spot, for a bit of a Marina crowd, and a bit of Financial district.  So expect that superiority attitude to come with, even from the bartenders and bouncer.  I seriously had to say excuse me, into a girls ear, 10x before i finally had to gently push her to get through.  I know you're busy talking with a bunch of boys lady, but don't mean you can block traffic with your flat ass.  And the bartender chick, smile a bit please.  Yes you are considered hot, but attitude makes your hotness go down, way down.   \n\nSo if the staff was friendlier, crowd was more pleasant, had some tunes, I can see myself chilling here.
