I kind of wish I had waited, but then I wouldn't have eaten until 9:30... Burmese Kitchen is small, but bustling. It looked like a lot of other people had the same idea of avoiding the wait and getting their food NOW. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, with a signup sheet attached to the door and two extra chairs just inside, but no real designated waiting area. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, when the first wave of diners seemed to all finish up at the same time. Their tables are all a bunch of two-tops that they can move as needed to accommodate larger parties. Unfortunately, the corner table we were given was really close to the other two-top. So close that when the hostess came by to take our orders, she had to wedge herself between the two tables. Also, when she was taking orders for the table next to us, she definitely kept hitting me in the shoulder. I think that they could make it a much better dining experience if they removed one of the two-tops from that row. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered the tea leaf salad, a roti with yellow potato curry, the mohinga, and garlic noodles with chicken. None of it was really that good.\n\nThe tea leaf salad was mostly nuts and lentils, and while I liked the crunch of it, I could tell that it wasn't freshly made because it came pre-mixed, versus the presentation I much prefer where they have small piles of each ingredient that they mix in front of you or let you mix yourself. It tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't really call it a salad given the lack of vegetables and leafy greens. \n\nThe roti and curry were good, but disappointing in the disproportionate amount of roti to curry: only one roti, though you can order an additional roti for $4. For the small size, I didn't think it was worth it. The curry was underseasoned, even if the potatoes were cooked through, they had no taste, no spice, no flavor. \n\nThe mohinga was okay, but also rather bland. The noodles were beyond overcooked to the point of dissolving in my mouth at each bite. I couldn't really taste any of the fish, maybe it dissolved as well? I did like the crispy lentil cakes, which added the only texture found in the soup. \n\nMy garlic noodles were a HUGE disappointment, so bland and fishy tasting, even though I added chicken. The chicken was old and chewy and had an off flavor, and it didn't mix well with the noodles. The noodles themselves were like thin-cut egg noodles that clumped together and had absolutely no flavor. The only texture came from the fried garlic that garnished the dish, but quickly fell off. I would never recommend ordering this to anyone, especially not at $10 a pop. \n\nI would say that we made the wrong choice in coming to Burmese Kitchen instead of waiting for Burma Superstar. $42 including tax and tip, and so not worth it.

Both of my parents are from Burma and are pretty active in the Burmese community in the Bay Area so I'm always skeptical when it comes to Burmese food.  The first and last restaurant I went to was Rangoon Ruby in Palo Alto and was fairly unimpressed in terms of quality per dollar. So I went to Burmese Kitchen with low expectations and had them shattered.\n\nI went with three of my friends and decided to order family style.  We got the tea leaf salad, coconut chicken soup, spicy fish, chicken curry, and chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf.\n\nIf this isn't highlighted enough in the other reviews, the tea leaf salad was AMAZING!  I was extremely impressed how fresh the leaves were and how flavorful the marinate was.  We only ordered one dish for the four of us and it wasn't enough.  I'd recommend 1 for every 2 people unless you plan on filling up with a variety of dishes.\n\nCoconut chicken soup is probably one of my favorite burmese dishes because it's almost at every family party I've been to so my relatives get a lot of practice making it.  While it was still pretty good at Burmese kitchen, I wasn't mind blown.  But again, it's hard for me to judge. I think it's worth trying if you haven't had it before.\n\nWe had the spicy fish and chicken curry with coconut rice and I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do the same!  This is definitely a dish I'd get the next time I come here.  The chicken was very tender and would fall off the bone and paired perfectly with the rice.  The fish was a little too hot for someone in our group, but if you're fine with spicy food it was this is also a must!\n\nIf you're looking for something uniquely Burmese, I'd give the chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf a try.  Admittedly it was a little weird for two of my friends since sour food isn't really popular in most cultures but if you want to be adventurous I think this is definitely something different.\n\ntldr; The must haves are the tea leaf salad and coconut rice with chicken (and spicy fish if you can handle heat).  \nIf you want to try something more unique to Burmese culture try the coconut chicken soup but stay safe and if you're adventurous the chin baung jaw.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We always order the same things --- Rainbow salad, tea leaf salad, coconut noodle soup. \n\n"], "author": "Sai S.", "review": "We have ordered takeout about 10 times now.

The roti was pretty small, so we had to eat some curry without bread, but it was still excellent. Next came the garlic egg noodles. They weren't very special - definitely the least inspired dish, but I did like the crispy garlic in it.  Finally we had the lemongrass beef. I don't think I've ever had this dish before, so the closest comparison I can come up with is mas-su-man beef.  It was the same style of stewed beef, with a similar type of gravy on it, but with a milder flavor. \nIt's a cute little restaurant and the service was quick and friendly.

The roti is a thicker kind and it's delicious with almost anything, in this case, potato curry!  Vegetarian option.\n\nMohinga - international dish of Burma.  I tried this dish in other Burmese restaurants, but this one hits home.  It's burmese catfish soup with noodle and fried yellow pea.  This dish is eaten as breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner in Burma.  \n\nCoconut chicken curry (Oh nok kaw swe) - I personally prefer this over mohinga.  Both are very delicious.\n\nTea leaf salad - this dish is hyped here more than in Burma.  It's a mix of tea leaf, nuts, sesame, some veggies, and tomato.  It's fresh and uniquely Burmese.\n\nFish with Tamarine Sauce - this was my favorite dish.  The fish was tender and had the perfect flavor with rice.  Highly recommended!\n\nOther dishes to consider:\n- Pork with Pickled Mango\n- Spicy shrimp\n- Nan Ji Thok - rice noodle mixed with veggies and chicken.  This doesn't come in soup, but is still tasty!\n- Burmese tea - Burmese tea houses are big in Burma (similar to tea houses in China).

Style Signature Tea Leaf Salad (homestyle with extra fermented tea leaf, fried garlic, sesame seeds, shredded cabbage, assorted peas & peanuts, $9.75): Frankly I'm not sure if the extra $2 is worth it over the regular tea leaf salad; I was just enticed by the name. It is definitely one of the most flavorful tea leaf salads I've ever had--pungently aromatic tea leaf, blended into multidimensional character with the assorted peas, topped with a flamboyant coating of sesame seeds. It comes already mixed so it may look as good as other restaurants where all the ingredients are presented in little piles, but the taste is exquisitely exotic.\n\n(++) Ong Noh Kau Swel (coconut chicken soup egg noodle, diced chicken in coconut broth, fried split peas, and hard boil egg, $9.50): An outstandingly balanced coconut soup--just the right amount of coconut without being too creamy. It could have used more chicken, but the soft noodles and overall composition of comforting ingredients essentially make this fancy chicken noodle soup.\n\n(++) Pork Curry (Pork with pureed onion, garlic, mustard seeds & spices, $8.50): The slow-cooked tender pork and housemade blend of curry make this memorable despite its plain name and presentation. I really like how the curry is vegetable based so it's satisfying but light.\n\nCompared to other Burmese places Burmese Kitchen is a little more more hole-in-the-wall, and by hole-in-the-wall, I just mean in size and fame. It's a smaller place and not as frequently discussed as Burma Superstar or Mandalay, but nonetheless a nice restaurant with a relaxing and refined ambiance (though they could do away with the collage of painted paper plates).", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-12-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We got the tea leaf salad, coconut chicken soup, spicy fish, chicken curry, and chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf.\n\n", "If this isn't highlighted enough in the other reviews, the tea leaf salad was AMAZING!

Both of my parents are from Burma and are pretty active in the Burmese community in the Bay Area so I'm always skeptical when it comes to Burmese food.  The first and last restaurant I went to was Rangoon Ruby in Palo Alto and was fairly unimpressed in terms of quality per dollar. So I went to Burmese Kitchen with low expectations and had them shattered.\n\nI went with three of my friends and decided to order family style.  We got the tea leaf salad, coconut chicken soup, spicy fish, chicken curry, and chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf.\n\nIf this isn't highlighted enough in the other reviews, the tea leaf salad was AMAZING!  I was extremely impressed how fresh the leaves were and how flavorful the marinate was.  We only ordered one dish for the four of us and it wasn't enough.  I'd recommend 1 for every 2 people unless you plan on filling up with a variety of dishes.\n\nCoconut chicken soup is probably one of my favorite burmese dishes because it's almost at every family party I've been to so my relatives get a lot of practice making it.  While it was still pretty good at Burmese kitchen, I wasn't mind blown.  But again, it's hard for me to judge. I think it's worth trying if you haven't had it before.\n\nWe had the spicy fish and chicken curry with coconut rice and I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do the same!  This is definitely a dish I'd get the next time I come here.  The chicken was very tender and would fall off the bone and paired perfectly with the rice.  The fish was a little too hot for someone in our group, but if you're fine with spicy food it was this is also a must!\n\nIf you're looking for something uniquely Burmese, I'd give the chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf a try.  Admittedly it was a little weird for two of my friends since sour food isn't really popular in most cultures but if you want to be adventurous I think this is definitely something different.\n\ntldr; The must haves are the tea leaf salad and coconut rice with chicken (and spicy fish if you can handle heat).  \nIf you want to try something more unique to Burmese culture try the coconut chicken soup but stay safe and if you're adventurous the chin baung jaw.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Coconut chicken soup, tea leaf salad of course and lemongrass beef.

He chose the pork with pickled mango, pumpkin stew, and biryani rice - all for $12. (Their lunch menu is posted online).\n\nI ordered the Soup and Salad for $12. Choice of soup: fish chowder, samosa soup, or chicken coconut noodle soup. Choice of salad: tea leaf or ginger salad. The salad was small but sufficient. The chicken coconut noodle soup was good and filled me, and I left satisfied.\n\nThe owner was very friendly. He said he was testing out the lunch hours.

However, Burmese Kitchen is a great place to take your friends out and try different things on the menu because hey, Burmese restaurants are pretty rare.  This place has legit Burmese food and reminds me of everything I love about Burmese cuisines.\n\nRoti and Curry - Delicious!  The roti is a thicker kind and it's delicious with almost anything, in this case, potato curry!  Vegetarian option.\n\nMohinga - international dish of Burma.  I tried this dish in other Burmese restaurants, but this one hits home.  It's burmese catfish soup with noodle and fried yellow pea.  This dish is eaten as breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner in Burma.  \n\nCoconut chicken curry (Oh nok kaw swe) - I personally prefer this over mohinga.  Both are very delicious.\n\nTea leaf salad - this dish is hyped here more than in Burma.  It's a mix of tea leaf, nuts, sesame, some veggies, and tomato.  It's fresh and uniquely Burmese.\n\nFish with Tamarine Sauce - this was my favorite dish.  The fish was tender and had the perfect flavor with rice.  Highly recommended!\n\nOther dishes to consider:\n- Pork with Pickled Mango\n- Spicy shrimp\n- Nan Ji Thok - rice noodle mixed with veggies and chicken.

I kind of wish I had waited, but then I wouldn't have eaten until 9:30... Burmese Kitchen is small, but bustling. It looked like a lot of other people had the same idea of avoiding the wait and getting their food NOW. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, with a signup sheet attached to the door and two extra chairs just inside, but no real designated waiting area. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, when the first wave of diners seemed to all finish up at the same time. Their tables are all a bunch of two-tops that they can move as needed to accommodate larger parties. Unfortunately, the corner table we were given was really close to the other two-top. So close that when the hostess came by to take our orders, she had to wedge herself between the two tables. Also, when she was taking orders for the table next to us, she definitely kept hitting me in the shoulder. I think that they could make it a much better dining experience if they removed one of the two-tops from that row. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered the tea leaf salad, a roti with yellow potato curry, the mohinga, and garlic noodles with chicken. None of it was really that good.\n\nThe tea leaf salad was mostly nuts and lentils, and while I liked the crunch of it, I could tell that it wasn't freshly made because it came pre-mixed, versus the presentation I much prefer where they have small piles of each ingredient that they mix in front of you or let you mix yourself. It tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't really call it a salad given the lack of vegetables and leafy greens. \n\nThe roti and curry were good, but disappointing in the disproportionate amount of roti to curry: only one roti, though you can order an additional roti for $4. For the small size, I didn't think it was worth it. The curry was underseasoned, even if the potatoes were cooked through, they had no taste, no spice, no flavor. \n\nThe mohinga was okay, but also rather bland. The noodles were beyond overcooked to the point of dissolving in my mouth at each bite. I couldn't really taste any of the fish, maybe it dissolved as well? I did like the crispy lentil cakes, which added the only texture found in the soup. \n\nMy garlic noodles were a HUGE disappointment, so bland and fishy tasting, even though I added chicken. The chicken was old and chewy and had an off flavor, and it didn't mix well with the noodles. The noodles themselves were like thin-cut egg noodles that clumped together and had absolutely no flavor. The only texture came from the fried garlic that garnished the dish, but quickly fell off. I would never recommend ordering this to anyone, especially not at $10 a pop. \n\nI would say that we made the wrong choice in coming to Burmese Kitchen instead of waiting for Burma Superstar. $42 including tax and tip, and so not worth it.

I went on a  Friday evening and they were packed!  I usually don't go to Burmese restaurants because my folks make it at home and that's pretty much what I eat almost everyday.  However, Burmese Kitchen is a great place to take your friends out and try different things on the menu because hey, Burmese restaurants are pretty rare.  This place has legit Burmese food and reminds me of everything I love about Burmese cuisines.\n\nRoti and Curry - Delicious!  The roti is a thicker kind and it's delicious with almost anything, in this case, potato curry!  Vegetarian option.\n\nMohinga - international dish of Burma.  I tried this dish in other Burmese restaurants, but this one hits home.  It's burmese catfish soup with noodle and fried yellow pea.  This dish is eaten as breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner in Burma.  \n\nCoconut chicken curry (Oh nok kaw swe) - I personally prefer this over mohinga.  Both are very delicious.\n\nTea leaf salad - this dish is hyped here more than in Burma.  It's a mix of tea leaf, nuts, sesame, some veggies, and tomato.  It's fresh and uniquely Burmese.\n\nFish with Tamarine Sauce - this was my favorite dish.  The fish was tender and had the perfect flavor with rice.  Highly recommended!\n\nOther dishes to consider:\n- Pork with Pickled Mango\n- Spicy shrimp\n- Nan Ji Thok - rice noodle mixed with veggies and chicken.  This doesn't come in soup, but is still tasty!\n- Burmese tea - Burmese tea houses are big in Burma (similar to tea houses in China).

The proportions b/w the three was different which made this TLS memorable.\n\n2. Samosas Soup: Karl the Fog visited and this soup was perfect for tonight's weather.
