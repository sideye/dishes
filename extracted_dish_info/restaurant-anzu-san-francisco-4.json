The ambience is on point, the service is phenomenal, and we really enjoyed our meal. He made a reservation on Open Table, and apparently being an \"early bird\" in the evening meant that we'd get two complimentary glasses of ros\u00e9. It was delicious and a perfect level of sweetness.\n\nTitus roll - this wasn't bad, but also not great. I felt that there wasn't enough flavor in the roll itself, although the ingredients tasted fresh (especially the spicy tuna). This isn't something I'd order again because I could get a great sushi roll elsewhere and at a lower price. My fiance wanted to try the Local Motion roll that he saw on Yelp, but the chef was not willing to make it because it wasn't on the current menu. We understood though, and were happy to choose an alternative.\nThe Rock - we mainly ordered this for the \"cool\" factor of cooking our meat on a hot rock. It seemed quite gimmicky and we assumed we would only be given a few slices of meat, but we went for it anyway and I'm so glad we did! The dish came with a good amount of thinly sliced wagyu beef, and it was soft, tender, and had a great flavor all on its own. Plus, it was fun :P This comes with a trio of sauces - spicy korean sauce (similar to gojuchang), kizami carrot sauce, and cilantro puree (my favorite one). \nMisoyaki black cod - absolutely delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly and was very soft and moist. The truffle dashi broth was awesome and we drank all of it at the end. The pumpkin gnocchi had a good bounce to it, and the braised daikon radish absorbed the broth's flavor so well. We both thoroughly enjoyed this.\nTruffle mushroom risotto - this was a side order to supplement our meal. It smelled strongly of truffle, but the actual truffle flavor was lighter. The rice wasn't as soft as usual risotto, but my fiance actually preferred this texture. Finally, there were lots of mushrooms, just the way we like it.\n\nWe ordered the perfect amount of food and were completely satisfied. What made the meal amazing and worthy of that fifth star, however, is the service. Our waiter Acen was extremely nice right from the beginning, always had a smile on his face, and was so attentive to us throughout the meal. When he found out it was our anniversary, he let us choose a dessert item and came out with two glasses of dessert wine. The salted caramel pot de creme was delicious and Acen even wrote out \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate with chocolate sauce and little crispies. This was a perfect cap to our dinner. David was also wonderful and we really appreciated his great service! He was quick to get us whatever we needed, and he definitely made our meal a fun one with lots of laughter! We loved asking about hobbies shown on everyone's name tags - what a great idea to include that. The hostess in the front greeted us so warmly, and a manager stopped by our table to check in on us. Anzu's staff is top notch and we were very impressed.\n\nMy fiance and I had such a great night, and it is one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.

Anzu is tucked away in the glamorous Hotel Nikko and boasts a classy, upscale ambiance with fantastic service. The food, while on the pricey side is very good. I'm already planning my next trip back!\n\nFood:\n1. Unfortunately, the Restaurant Week menu was disappointing. For $40 you received a Bean Salad starter , Crusted Tuna Entree and a Fondue dessert. The bean salad looked fresh, but uninteresting, and while the crusted tuna entree was very generous, the tuna was under seasoned and tough. In short, I would not recommend coming to Anzu for Restaurant Week. \n\nTheir ala carte menu on the other hand, was very good. I started with \"The Rock\", a stone heated to 400F on which you could cook thin slices of Wagyu beef. It was fun, entertaining and delicious. We also tried the Ceviche sampler which was light and refreshing. \n\nFor the main, the waitress recommended the cod which was DELICIOUS. The cod was tender and cooked to perfection in a light dashi broth. I loved my dish and thought it was well worth $26 considering the quality and quantity served. \n\nThe highlight of the night, however was the chocolate fondue. It was a revelation. I have never experienced such deliciousness EVER. The chocolate fondue was nutty, creamy and yet surprisingly light. We polished off almost the entire pot and still wanted more and were extremely perplexed by how light, fluffy and addictive the fondue was. If I was on my own I'd have licked the pot clean :D I would definitely come back just to have their fondue again.\n\nIn short, I had a fabulous experience at Anzu and will definitely be back. I would say you can probably skip over this place for Restaurant Week (Lusk 25 has a much better RW menu), but you should absolutely visit on your own time to try the delectable black cod dish and of course, their fondue.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-01-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We elected to start with \"The Rock\", which was sliced beef that we cooked on a 400 degree rock.

The black cod had good flavor and came in a nice broth with a bunch of vegetables, but it was really small. And all of us left the restaurant not really full, and I think that's mostly because of how small the cod was (we all shared). The risotto was great, definitely one of the better dishes. They don't use rice - it's something with more of a wheat texture, which actually made it really interesting. The beef strip loin was good. Some bites I thought were great and some were just okay.

She emailed us afterwards, sent us a holiday card, and took care of us each time we returned to Anzu for another meal. We would go to any restaurant where she worked.

First time I came here was over a year ago and I loved it so much, I came back three more times on my SF trips last year.\n\nAnzu is beautiful. I love their decor. It is located in Hotel Nikko right in Union Square. First time around, we took a cab from our fisher's man wharf hotel and the cab driver didn't know where it was. It was hard to see the sign from the street but the past few times, I've stayed at Hotel Nikko and it was a much easier way to get here.\n\nDecor~ beautiful! White coushy chairs, white couches. All white! \n\nService~ One of the waiter not only recognized me from my previous visit, he actually remembers my name. As I did his! He was so impressed, he bought me my favorite dessert from there. Insert a child like gleeeee for days! :)\n\nFood~ this isn't jut a sushi place. We had uni, we had oysters, we had lamb chops! So many things on their menu and got to try them all. Menu also did change in the past year or so but no complains here.\n\nStarters \nCeviche - sea bass with chillis and tobiko, Nice!\nKampachi carpaccio - this was so refreshingly good.

That was delish too.\nAnd 15 piece sashimi that I can't recall. All I remember was they all tasted so refreshing. \n\nAnd my favorite part. Don julio shots and dessert. The macarons and italian coffee were all great. As well as the white chocolate mousse but the star? The star of all the dessert is - THE FOG!!! \n\nIt's like entering a magical Forrest covered in fog. It also came to your table in such a fantastic presentation, you won't care what it taste like. But thank god, it has dark chocolate ( I discriminate on all the other kinds of chocolate except this), banana cream and butternut scotch sauce. Oh the picutresssss. Yes, I have many fog covered pictures from every possible angle. \n\nThey also stayed open late for us for a few times. Like I said, service is fantastic. And if I remember correctly, Ben was our rocking server. (Can't remember now-doh!) It was a pleasant, relaxing experience(s) that will you make you ooh and ahh for the entire time. Either that or I'm just being me and my super excited self for food. Either way, I love Anzu! You should too :) Definitely is a little higher on the pricey side but experience makes it worth it.

I'm not big on knowing famous or great chefs... but I took the yelpers' word for it =P  Regardless of your certificate, you're bound to pay like an extra $70 out of pocket.  The restaurant is in Hotel Nikko, which is in Union Sq.  It's a really nice hotel, and thus, a really nice restaurant, small but nice.  When you walk in, there's a sushi/oyster bar just past the hostess station and in the lounge area.\n\nWe got the appetizer called \"the ROCK\".  It's a pretty cool concept!  They heat up this black rock to a reallllllly high temperature, so high that you can see the steam coming off of it when it comes out.  You cook strips of sirloin on the rock and dip it into 3 different kinds of sauces.  The rock only stays hot for about 6 minutes, and begins to cool down.  I wish they gave you more meat... but nonetheless, it was really good.... and cost an arm and a leg ($18 for the appetizer)!\n\nFor our entrees, we got the miso black cod with risotto in broth.  THIS WAS O-M-F-G  DELICIOUS!!!!!  I really enjoyed this dish.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and had lots of flavor.

I would love to come here again if I had more money =P  With the Restaurant.com gift certificate, I still paid $70 for 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for 2 people.  \n\nParking can be difficult, but you can park about 1-2 blocks away towards the TL and just walk over.
