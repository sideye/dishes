", "Thinly sliced apples baked on top of flaky pastry. "], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "Those that know me know that I like to frequent bakeries and that I like gougeres. A good friend at work lived near this bakery and once brought me a few gougeres from Thorough Bread. I had not heard of this place at that time, so I thought he had gone to a horse show. \nA few minutes passed, and I polished them off. I tried to savor all four, because they're small, but leave some carbs on my desk and you're asking them to disappear.\nSo naturally I paid Thorough Bread & Pastry a visit after that taste... and a couple more times after that. The childlike crayon logo is very charming.\n\nGougeres - 4 for $2? 12 for $4.50? \nI'll take 2 dozen please. I'll serve them proudly on a plate and pretend they are homemade. Just kidding...kind of. A gougere is a cheese puff. Given the price and inconspicuous appearance, you wouldn't think much of them, but I found them to be executed well. The dough was light and puffy, with many pockets of air. The cheese and chive flavor was savory and well-balanced.\n\nChouquettes - 4 for $2\nBasically the sweet version of puff pastry, topped with a few specks of pearl sugar\n\nCream Puffs - 3 for $3.50\nA rather light cream puff with chocolate drizzled on top, also with pearl sugar. delightful\n\nDanish - $2.00\nI had a blueberry and a cheese danish. Both were delicious and flaky with a glaze. The blueberry could have used more fruit filling. The cheese danish was just creamy and smooth.\n\nAlmond Croissant - $3.50\nThis is an excellent croissant, super flaky and airy with generous almond paste on top and lots of almond slivers. I think it rivals some of the best almond croissants in the city.\n\nApple Galette - $2.50\nVery good apple tart. Thinly sliced apples baked on top of flaky pastry. There was a shiny, sweet glaze on top that added sweetness and was probably a good glue to keep the apple slices in place\n\nChocolate Bread - $3.50\nI didn't have high hopes for chocolate bread. I thought it would be dry, but it was pillowy inside with a nice outer crust. The best part was it was loaded with chocolate chips.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie - $1.50\nThin, crunchy cookie, also with plenty of choc chips\n\nBasil Mozzarella Sandwich - $7\nThe bread on the sandwich was excellent of course. The tomatoes & mozzarella tasted fresh. I love a good simple caprese sandwich, but I would have preferred it toasted. It seemed like they had just finished serving their morning crowd and didn't bother to ask us if we wanted it toasted. Oh well. It also came with some mixed greens. \n\nThorough Bread has a lot of variety - pastries, fresh bread, cakes, sandwiches, etc. Grabbing a few things to eat and hanging out in their outdoor patio in the back is a good way to spend a sunny afternoon.

Tartine's bread ties, but then you can't get T bread whenever you want it. In fact, you can't get it unless you know three, that's right three  days ahead that you are going to have a \"Bread Attack!\" \n\nAlmond Croissant IS the BEST in San Francisco! \n\nSticky Bun - The Same!\nExcellent Baguette and Sour dough bread!\n\nMy first visit, so you will have to wait for the cake and pastry review. How do I already know what that is going to be like?!!\n\n I feel like I am about to unleash the ten Plagues of Egypt. I know, so dramatic. Yet, here I am about to write the review that I never thought would be possible. \n\nFirst, I am a breadie, a sub set of the foodie (I'm all that too!) and there is, was, only one bread God in San Francisco. I was, for a long time, more than willing to put up with the inconvenience of serving the God of Bread, in order to have him/her provide me with that particular slice of heaven on those occasions that I needed my fix. And yes, a \"fix\" it was. There were pretenders to the throne, some of which were within a crumb's width of matching the God, yet none could quite get there. Outerlands, comes so close, their bread is outstanding!\n\nNow that is no longer true. Thorough Bread & Pastry has succeeded in creating a bread just as good as... sit down, ...Tartine's. \n\nDon't go all Al Bundy on me, if your Great provider has been overthrown, it is, after all, the way of the world. But wait you exclaim, \"You said that the bread was just as good, not better!\"\n\nYes, and thereby lies the tale. For those who truly love food, there is this (sometimes unspoken) relationship with those who create the food we delight in. For some, it is what we live for. Part of this relationship is the mutual respect that unfolds between the maker and the consumer of extraordinary products. In many cases this mutual respect revels itself when the artist who creates, thrives in knowing how well his creation is received. This is why, so many times, the ubiquitous Hole in the Wall place is so revered. The connection is intimate, and ultimately REAL!\n\nThorough Bread and Pastry succeeds fully, while Tartine, well made bread not withstanding, fails.\n\n Respect for the customer, understanding that while none of us who revel in what is made would ever, for a moment have any qualms over the producers of what we love so much, making a financial profit. It isn't ever about the cost of the product, it is always about having a mutual connection, and sadly, Tartine  believes it is a one way street.\n\n Thorough Bread and Pastry walks the walk. Their products are just as good and as noted in some areas exceed T. They also respect their customers in providing the products that they do so well, not as peasants who get whatever happens to be thrown their way.\n\nOf course what I fear most is adding to the numbers of people who will descend upon Thorough bread and Pastry when they read the reviews, but then, as they live up to their side of the bargain, then so must I.\n\nSo, if you are a foodie or better yet a breadie, then you must go to Thorough Bread and Pastry and try the recommended items, although once inside you will almost see delights that match your own preferences and try those instead (too?). You won't go wrong no matter what you decide to try.\n\nYou will get a big smile from the cashier (another plus for TBAP they have an efficient system that helps move the line, not an outdated someone takes order another cashes you out - slower and too many times one gets another person's order)\n\nBest of all, you don't have to call three days ahead - the ultimate slap in the face for those who truly love T bread -you can when you feel like having a really good bread, just go there and get it. For those who need to get it hot out of the oven, their Purple Wheat bread comes out by 11:30\n.\nThe cherry on top? The parking is better at Thorough Bread and Pastry.

The always-fresh blueberry bran muffin gushes with juicy blueberries (but not too much so) and is tempered with delicious bran that makes me drop it like it's hot. Their macaroons make me thankful for being born. I vow to try every cake dessert they offer, because each one looks like a discotheque of sugar and sweets with prices so low I trip over them as I dance to the next display case. \n\nThe reason I give five stars? Because as I type this I'm \"chewing the muffin\" (if you know what I mean). And because, unlike most places in San Francisco worth their weight in saliva, there is never a line. It's generally busy, mind you, but what these guys get right in pastry deliciousness, they get even more right in service and realizing that you don't need an incredibly annoying line to attract people to your business. Each time I've been here they've had at least 3 cashiers helping the line along in an incredibly friendly and helpful manner - as if you are all together one and the same - united by the delicious snacks surrounding. This efficiency gets you in and out in under 5 minutes, with your delicious muffin sack tucked safely at your side. No line: a San Francisco miracle. You have the rest of the day to complete life goals! Like drinking the ocean, wondering if North Korea is real, and finally calling things off with your doctor who thinks \"you're a really neat girl\". While this does wonders for your day off, it may be a nightmare for your social life. Who really wants to spend time with friends unless you're both standing in a 30 minute line for a pastry? Not me, and that's why I have none of either.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-10-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The blueberry bran muffin is clearly a favorite for not just me seeing how that one tends to go fast in the mornings.\n\n"], "author": "Melissa H.", "review": "I discovered this sweet neighborhood spot while in grad school when it wasn't uncommon for me to post up in a public space for hours on end.

A good friend at work lived near this bakery and once brought me a few gougeres from Thorough Bread. I had not heard of this place at that time, so I thought he had gone to a horse show. \nA few minutes passed, and I polished them off. I tried to savor all four, because they're small, but leave some carbs on my desk and you're asking them to disappear.\nSo naturally I paid Thorough Bread & Pastry a visit after that taste... and a couple more times after that. The childlike crayon logo is very charming.\n\nGougeres - 4 for $2? 12 for $4.50? \nI'll take 2 dozen please. I'll serve them proudly on a plate and pretend they are homemade. Just kidding...kind of. A gougere is a cheese puff. Given the price and inconspicuous appearance, you wouldn't think much of them, but I found them to be executed well. The dough was light and puffy, with many pockets of air. The cheese and chive flavor was savory and well-balanced.\n\nChouquettes - 4 for $2\nBasically the sweet version of puff pastry, topped with a few specks of pearl sugar\n\nCream Puffs - 3 for $3.50\nA rather light cream puff with chocolate drizzled on top, also with pearl sugar. delightful\n\nDanish - $2.00\nI had a blueberry and a cheese danish. Both were delicious and flaky with a glaze. The blueberry could have used more fruit filling. The cheese danish was just creamy and smooth.\n\nAlmond Croissant - $3.50\nThis is an excellent croissant, super flaky and airy with generous almond paste on top and lots of almond slivers. I think it rivals some of the best almond croissants in the city.\n\nApple Galette - $2.50\nVery good apple tart. Thinly sliced apples baked on top of flaky pastry. There was a shiny, sweet glaze on top that added sweetness and was probably a good glue to keep the apple slices in place\n\nChocolate Bread - $3.50\nI didn't have high hopes for chocolate bread. I thought it would be dry, but it was pillowy inside with a nice outer crust. The best part was it was loaded with chocolate chips.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie - $1.50\nThin, crunchy cookie, also with plenty of choc chips\n\nBasil Mozzarella Sandwich - $7\nThe bread on the sandwich was excellent of course. The tomatoes & mozzarella tasted fresh. I love a good simple caprese sandwich, but I would have preferred it toasted. It seemed like they had just finished serving their morning crowd and didn't bother to ask us if we wanted it toasted. Oh well. It also came with some mixed greens. \n\nThorough Bread has a lot of variety - pastries, fresh bread, cakes, sandwiches, etc. Grabbing a few things to eat and hanging out in their outdoor patio in the back is a good way to spend a sunny afternoon.

My boyfriend says that Tartine's are better depending on the pastry, but that it's more or less the same (but minus the line, attitude, and lack of seating like at Tartine). Coffee is delicious as well, nice selection of teas, they also have wonderful sandwiches and soups. The bowl of soup (today was tomato&celery w/cumin, mmm) was so hot and fresh, and came with a sliced up baguette, all for less than $5. The back patio is also a huge plus, along with the wonderful customers who frequent the place- not the pretentious hipster crowd, but the normal people crowd- old and young, sewing clubs and cute couples and people practicing their Spanish over coffee and pastries. They are also very accommodating to cyclists, as I often bike here on my way home from a ride and leave my bike in the entrance while quickly grabbing bread for lunch. I've also spent hours in the back patio and brought my bike back there with me (I asked first and they were fine with it).

I tried to savor all four, because they're small, but leave some carbs on my desk and you're asking them to disappear.\nSo naturally I paid Thorough Bread & Pastry a visit after that taste... and a couple more times after that. The childlike crayon logo is very charming.\n\nGougeres - 4 for $2? 12 for $4.50? \nI'll take 2 dozen please. I'll serve them proudly on a plate and pretend they are homemade. Just kidding...kind of. A gougere is a cheese puff. Given the price and inconspicuous appearance, you wouldn't think much of them, but I found them to be executed well. The dough was light and puffy, with many pockets of air. The cheese and chive flavor was savory and well-balanced.\n\nChouquettes - 4 for $2\nBasically the sweet version of puff pastry, topped with a few specks of pearl sugar\n\nCream Puffs - 3 for $3.50\nA rather light cream puff with chocolate drizzled on top, also with pearl sugar. delightful\n\nDanish - $2.00\nI had a blueberry and a cheese danish. Both were delicious and flaky with a glaze. The blueberry could have used more fruit filling. The cheese danish was just creamy and smooth.\n\nAlmond Croissant - $3.50\nThis is an excellent croissant, super flaky and airy with generous almond paste on top and lots of almond slivers. I think it rivals some of the best almond croissants in the city.\n\nApple Galette - $2.50\nVery good apple tart. Thinly sliced apples baked on top of flaky pastry. There was a shiny, sweet glaze on top that added sweetness and was probably a good glue to keep the apple slices in place\n\nChocolate Bread - $3.50\nI didn't have high hopes for chocolate bread. I thought it would be dry, but it was pillowy inside with a nice outer crust. The best part was it was loaded with chocolate chips.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie - $1.50\nThin, crunchy cookie, also with plenty of choc chips\n\nBasil Mozzarella Sandwich - $7\nThe bread on the sandwich was excellent of course. The tomatoes & mozzarella tasted fresh. I love a good simple caprese sandwich, but I would have preferred it toasted. It seemed like they had just finished serving their morning crowd and didn't bother to ask us if we wanted it toasted. Oh well. It also came with some mixed greens. \n\nThorough Bread has a lot of variety - pastries, fresh bread, cakes, sandwiches, etc. Grabbing a few things to eat and hanging out in their outdoor patio in the back is a good way to spend a sunny afternoon.

Thorough Bread offered a handful of fillings, and I asked one of the bakers behind the counter which she would recommend. She quickly said pistachio, and so I got that with a sticky morning bun to go. This was two years ago, mind you. i remember the flavors to this day.\n\npistachio jalousie: incredibly good. there were a couple of dark, tart cherries in there too, which was a great surprise. alas, they do not make jalousie anymore! i asked the french lady who works there about the jalousie on another visit, and she said they stopped making it due to its lack of popularity. felt a sharp jab to the heart, was about to fall to my knees with fist shaking in the air and scream 'NOOOOoooooooooooooooooo.....................'. refrained, got a baguette, felt a new kind of happy. but seriously, it would terrific to have their pistachio jalousie again. \n\nsticky morning bun: good, sweet, sticky. not my favorite item on their menu, but yummy nonetheless. make sure to have napkins and water to clean up after you attack this. best eaten with hands, the sticky fingers made me feel 4 again.\n\nalmond croissant: JUST DO IT. a must-order. 7 billion calories and 3 tubs of butter per croissant but choose to live a lot and jog the next day. love thyself, pamper your tastebuds with this. i tell people this; i'm not a fan of almonds, i'm not a fan of croissant. but together, and with all that butter... i choose to love myself. and jog til i drop tomorrow. maybe. when this is hot out the oven, GET ON THAT THING PRONTO!\n\nbaguette: so damn simple and tasty. i have the smaller one with butter and jam when i eat in, but it's amazing on its own too. just the right crunch/crisp exterior, with a wonderful pillowy and chewy interior. they do it right.\n\nchocolate bread: not usually a fan of chocolate, but this chocolate overload gets a thumbs up. chocolate bread with chocolate chips contained within. mmmmmmmmmm. i dunk chunks of this in hot coffee and indulge in feelings of BOSS.\n\nvol au vent: super flaky, with oozing bechamel at just the right richness and creaminess. the mushrooms taste super earthy, which brings tears of joy to my eyes. always a bittersweet moment when i finish one of these, because i do not want to appear gross and order another one when i have other pastries on the table. this is straight up delish.\n\ncoffee eclair: this was decent, it tasted good but i feel that the bakery's other offerings overshadow it.\n\nspinach quiche: not a fan, i thought it was way too eggy to be good. also, it had a light texture which did not seem to be up my ally. as i ate this, all i tasted was tamago/the sweet egg omelet staple served in most sushi joints.\n\nhomemade jams: Thorough Bread has quite a selection of these for sale. I've not bought an entire jar of any jam, but they do provide a small container of it to go with your baguette and other breads on request. i'm not sure how much they charge for this single serve, but do try out the different flavors. i love the subtle yet clear flavors of the jams, they taste very clean and 'natural'. the consistency differs per jam, with the runniest i've had being lavender. VERY floral-tasting; i liked it while a friend said it reminded her of her grandma R.I.P ... so to each his/her own on this. the plum jam is a personal favorite of mine, and i'm keen to try their rose jam sometime.\n\ncoffees: not the best, i personally think their basic black is weak most of the time. their lattes get pretty foamy though, which makes it fun to drink. i'm a fan of the milk foam 'stache, so i enjoy the froth. the mocha is alright tasting, not the smoothest i've had. would be great if they could up their coffee to match their splendid pastries, as it would elevate the pastry-eating experience to whole new level!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-06-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The small chocolate bread is mixed with cocoa powder to give it a not too sweet  flavor with a smattering of chips.
