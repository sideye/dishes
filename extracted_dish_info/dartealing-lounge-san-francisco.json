We'd visited all of the popular tea spots in the city and were moments away from making a final decision. This place was a favorite. The set up is nice and it's just the right balance of shabby chic. They also have a private room available for parties (although the private room is a bit odd in that it seems to be connected to the next door spa/nail salon and has a visible massage or waxing room right next to it). Nevertheless, it seemed perfect for our purposes. We spent $70 ordering a spread of tea so we could check it out for ourselves. Everything was tasty and well presented but this is where the fun ended. \n\nFor starters, there only appeared to be one server in the entire place. While we had no real complaints about our service, I wondered how it would be once the place became more crowded. Would we be able to have our own server if we rented the private room? The server took us through the private room, we decided it would be perfect and the server told us the owner (who is apparently also the lone party planner) would be in momentarily and could answer any other questions we had about it. \"Great,\" we told her, \"please send her over when she arrives and it's convenient--this is definitely where we want to have our friend's shower.\" After repeated requests throughout our tea, however, we were told that the owner was indeed there, but refused to meet with us and would only correspond about it online (Wednesday through Friday, as it says on their website). \"But we'd like to put a deposit down right now and lock in the date while we can, would she just be able to stop by our table for a minute to confirm?\" We were repeatedly told no by our server--even after the woman who appeared to be the owner arrived and glanced at us several times while fielding phone calls from mere feet away. \n\nI understand being busy, but the place was by no means packed at that point and we were there inquiring about booking their private from for up to 25 people and paying whatever it took to do so (for several hours).

If it's this difficult to merely inquire about booking, how tough will it be to actually plan a special party at this place? For the record, the people at both Crown and Crumpet and Lovejoy's were immediately responsive, during far busier tea services. Both places took the time to enthusiastically send someone over to answer questions and provide helpful information, making the prospect of a throwing a shower with them far more appealing.

Honestly though, the tea wasn't particularly special. Maybe my friend and I just didn't pick the right ones. We asked for recommendations and went with two of them, but weren't very impressed.\n\nWe ordered the BLOOMSBURY FULL TEA for 2 ($52), which included 2 pots of tea, 4 tea sandwiches, green salad, tea bread, scones, macarons and shortbread cookies.\n\nFor our tea, we got:\n     * DEBUTANTE BALL [subtle floral notes of jasmine, rose, creamy undertones, smooth finish] - I love floral teas so I went with this one for the jasmine and rose, but I guess the description wasn't kidding when it said \"subtle\" because I couldn't taste anything floral at all.

The mango was definitely noticeable, but I wasn't a huge fan.\n\nFor our sandwiches, we got:\n     * SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE & DILL - We each ordered the smoked salmon because we both lovee smoked salmon. We didn't realize it was going to be mostly mousse though, so we were unfortunately pretty disappointed. Some of the sandwiches had a tiny bit of smoked salmon but otherwise it was mostly a creamy, mayo-like paste.\n     * TURKEY & PESTO CREAM - Pretty much what you would expect: slices of turkey with pesto.\n     * DARTEALING CURRIED CHICKEN - Kind of like the salmon in the sense that it was more of a paste/spread rather than actual chicken. Maybe more like very, very shredded chicken. Flavor is pretty good though so I'd recommend it if you like savory food\n\nI really enjoyed all of the sweets too. The tea bread was some sort of yummy banana bread. The scones had a nice crispness on the outside and soft, fluffiness on the inside. The macarons were perfectly chewy!\n\nMy general impression though is that afternoon tea is really more about the atmosphere and the hours you spend chatting with your friends and less about the tea service itself, despite it being a tea lounge. I've been to Samovar in SF and Tea Time in Palo Alto and felt the same at both places as well. Not really complaining though. I still love taking time for afternoon tea, but $26 each is pretty pricey for some light tea and food, so I'd recommend just ordering a pot of tea and something separate to eat rather than a full tea service.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-12-26"}, {"excerpts": ["For tea, I knew I wanted something rose-based, and got the Debutante Ball.

We made reservations on a Saturday right when it opened.  The lounge stated that we would only have 20 minutes prior to opening to setup.  We arrived 30 minutes prior to opening because we wanted to maximize the time we had to setup.  We noticed that someone was inside and knocked hoping to get a few extra minutes, but we were completely ignored until another worker arrived right at 20 minutes prior to opening.  Despite being promised 20 minutes to setup we had less than 15 minutes to do so.  While setting up the owner rudely stated that 2 of my tiny girlfriends should not be standing on a bench because it was the 1700s or something like that.  (Um, side note, the bench is big enough to fit 4-5 full grown adults... so 2 of my girlfriends would no way break this bench.)  The owner pretty much complained about every decoration we had or where it was placed.  I would understand the owner's complaints if we had not informed the owner prior to the event, but we cleared it with her.  Talk about customer service...\n\nOn to the actual bridal shower... we made reservations for 25 people, but Dartealing only setup for 22 people.  (Why even make a reservation when the setup is not correct?!)  The tea service didn't being until 45 minutes AFTER our reservation time.  Keep in mind, the max reservation time at Dartealing is 2 hours.  Once most of the party had a round of of tea, the food came out (this was probably close to an hour + into the reservation).  The sandwiches were decent (i.e. hit-or-miss) - I enjoyed the curried chicken & chutney and the brie, pepper jelly & apple.  The teas were okay - none were really memorable with the exception of the cabana boy.  There was a fruity tea that was too strong and fragrant and the earl grey was quite disappointing.  The dessert selection was varied enough for everyone to enjoy something of her choosing.  The presentation of the food and teas was typical of a high tea lounge.  Honestly nothing special.  Kinda expensive all things considered.\n\nThis space is tiny.  This place feels so cluttered to the point it looks unorganized and dirty.  There were some cobwebs by the window area...  When cleaning up, the owner again angrily mentioned that we shouldn't be standing on the bench...\n\nThe workers didn't seem to like what they were doing (i.e. no smiles) and at minimum was decent at times.  The customer service was below average.  Unless I'm proven otherwise, I will not be recommending this place to friends nor returning (so I guess it'll be difficult to be proven otherwise... whatevs).  Just disappointing.  The bride-to-be enjoyed it and, despite the mediocrity of this place, it justifies the one-star.\n\nI'm not from SF, but I'm sure there are better places to spend your time and money for high tea.", "rating": 1, "date": "2016-11-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the Cabana Boy, which is good if you're looking for a fruity flavor that retains a strong tea flavor.

Dartealing feels like a cozy house with mismatched porcelain and chinaware (and questionable bathroom postcard decor). Most people come on a reservation, and there is almost nothing else to do in the immediate vicinity, so reservations are advised.\n\nWe did the Afternoon Tea for Two ($48 total), which came with two pots of tea, 12 finger sandwiches (3 flavors), salad, two scones, and 6 small sweet pieces. The tea list is very expansive. I got the Cabana Boy, which is good if you're looking for a fruity flavor that retains a strong tea flavor. Sandwiches were whatever (lots of bread), but some interesting varieties (my favorite was the Brie/Pepper/Apple). The scones were the best takeaway - freshly baked, not-hard-triangles, and unique flavor profiles (we had a lemon cardamon? rosemary? some kind of herb) and a cream spread that resembles at least the texture of clotted cream.\n\nI think the High Tea set actually looked more appealing, because they swap out some of the small dessert pieces for heartier savory items. Dartealing offers a laidback experience that your male friend/significant other would probably be a little more accepting of than the girlz-only zone of most kitschy tea lounges.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-02"}, {"excerpts": ["The Cabana Boy was a green tea with strawberries.

DarTealing is so charming and cute! \n\nMy cousin and I (and our boyfriends) were lucky enough to make it on Oct 3rd for their chocolate pairing and everyone including the boys enjoyed it! I didn't think chocolate tea can have such an interesting taste together.\n\nWe started off with the Violet Mist. I loved that it was decaf and I absolutely loved the taste of it! I actually liked it better sans cream! Then we had what felt like an unlimited supply of yummy sandwiches! We all agreed on the white fish mousse and the curry but I actually really enjoyed the cucumber as well!\n\nI was iffy about the salad-- the purple parts were too bitter for my taste.\n\nAnd then-- the magic of the chocolate pairing began! \nWe started with lighter teas and white chocolate and eventually ended with darker. I won't list all the teas we tried becuase that's practically the entire menu but I will give some honorable mentions!\n\nThe Cabana Boy was a green tea with strawberries. From first scent, we were in love!  We also enjoyed the chamomile lavender but our ultimate favorite of the day was the Lapsang Souchong. It has a very smokey taste to it but it reminded us all of dim sum and left us with a very warm feeling.\n\nI will definitely be back to DarTealing! The owner told us about having a buffet coming up some time in November-- I'm pretty sure my cousin and I will be back with the rest of the girls in the family!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-10-07"}, {"excerpts": ["For tea, I got the Cabana Boy, a green tea with papaya and strawberry.
