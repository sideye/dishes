Other popular dishes include chow mein and chow fun, lo mein, congee (rice porridge), wonton noodle soup with a variety of meats and soups that usually includes lettuce and some type of meat, meat and vegetable rice plates and seasonal vegetables.\n\nKam Po Kitchen had a pretty comprehensive menu list and is known for preparing most of these traditional and uniquely flavored dishes exceptionally well, including what many say are some of the best Chinese noodle soup in the city.\n\nWe reluctantly chose lighter dishes this evening because of our prior dinner reservation at Tony's Pizza Napoletana just a block away and dropped in looking for something to tie us down until then.\n\nThe noodle soup dishes, we figured, were a must-try and not too heavy. A friend also ordered a plate of steamed offals that we could share.\n\nThe mixed innards (offal), $3.95, were a good mix of steamed pig ears, intestines, stomach, gizzards and liver sparsely layered with a soy sauce and sesame oil mix. It was a rich and uniquely flavored, traditional dish that made for a great starter or appetizer.\n\nThe beef tendon noodle soup, $3.75, was a very good choice because they use the peripheral parts of the tendon which carried bits of flesh and fat, giving it a real beefy flavor and a meaty depth. The stringy egg noodles went perfectly with the hearty chunks of tendon and really soaked up the flavor of the delicately seasoned beef broth.\n\nThe shrimp wonton noodle soup, $3.25, had great texture and good flavor in its ingredients and nearly met my high standards for this dish. The gumdrop shaped, succulent shrimp wontons were made with whole shrimp and complemented with a mild soup broth and tasty wide rice noodles that were velvety soft and luxuriously smooth. The broth could have had more flavor. Otherwise, it would have been prepared to perfection.\n\nMost dishes fall under $5. I hope to return and try their Char Siu that they are widely known for to gain a broader perspective on the food here.

"], "author": "Roy C.", "review": "This is my new favorite Cantonese restaurant in SF. It reminds me so much of the dirty and grungy restaurants that I frequented when I lived in China -- none of which would ever pass a standard health inspection, but all of which are always crowded because of authentic, delicious Chinese food at outrageously low prices.\n\nIf you can stomach the unsanitary environment (including very questionable silverware -- e.g., deep brown stains on white soup spoons) and don't mind stuffing yourself into a crowded, loud space (during weekend lunch rush hours), then you're in for quite a treat at Kam Po. \n\nI'm actually surprised at how good the service is here -- on the surface, Kam Po should have the laughably-horrible customer service that we've all come to accept and love from Chinatown restaurants. The two waitresses were unbelievably busy, but always made time to come fill up our tea and bring us whatever we wanted. They even cracked a smile once or twice.\n\nThe most entertaining spectacle of the restaurant, however, is the butcher behind the counter, elevated as if on a stage. This is someone who possesses a razor-sharp butcher knife as an extension of his arm, slicing and chopping through pork ribs and duck necks in a way that looked strangely artistic. You could imagine a Beethoven symphony playing in the background as he beautifully butchers the back bones of a suckling pig. Benihana performances ain't got nothing on Kam Po. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nFOOD:\n\nRoast Pork = Incredible. The skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was unbelievably tender and juicy. We got there a little late, so the meat was a little cold from hanging on the hook throughout the morning, but the juiciness wasn't compromised in any way. I can only imagine how delicious it must be immediately after cooking.\n\nRoast Duck = Pretty good. I'm more of a fan of the Beijing-style roast duck with the crispy skin than this kind, where the skin is soggy from sweet and sour sauce. The meat was very tender, but I just don't really like having it drenched in so much sauce.\n\nPreserved Egg & Pork Porridge = Possibly the best preserved egg porridge I've had in San Francisco. There are so many full flavors packed into this porridge that it makes every bite delicious.\n\nGarlic Sauteed Pea Shoots = Loved it. It's a little oily, but the garlic flavors explode with each bite. The pea shoots are very nicely stir-fried, without being overcooked like they usually are. Keep in mind that it's actually pretty-hilariously written in Chinglish as \"Garlic Pea Sharts\" on the menu. I want to give Kam Po an extra star just for that.\n\nTotal: $20 after tax & tip. Yes, it was seriously that cheap.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nKam Po is like a wonderful slice of the true Chinese neighborhood experience. I've tried many restaurants and delis in Chinatown whose food is comparable to (and probably even better than) that of Kam Po, but Kam Po definitely delivers the full experience that I love most about Chinese restaurants.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-03-11"}, {"excerpts": ["The best roast duck and roast pork in Chinatown.

These weren't juicy.  I had two cubes of their roast pork - one piece was very chewy and dry and the other was pretty good.  \n\nIt looks like Kam Po has been here forever.

It reminds me so much of the dirty and grungy restaurants that I frequented when I lived in China -- none of which would ever pass a standard health inspection, but all of which are always crowded because of authentic, delicious Chinese food at outrageously low prices.\n\nIf you can stomach the unsanitary environment (including very questionable silverware -- e.g., deep brown stains on white soup spoons) and don't mind stuffing yourself into a crowded, loud space (during weekend lunch rush hours), then you're in for quite a treat at Kam Po. \n\nI'm actually surprised at how good the service is here -- on the surface, Kam Po should have the laughably-horrible customer service that we've all come to accept and love from Chinatown restaurants. The two waitresses were unbelievably busy, but always made time to come fill up our tea and bring us whatever we wanted. They even cracked a smile once or twice.\n\nThe most entertaining spectacle of the restaurant, however, is the butcher behind the counter, elevated as if on a stage. This is someone who possesses a razor-sharp butcher knife as an extension of his arm, slicing and chopping through pork ribs and duck necks in a way that looked strangely artistic. You could imagine a Beethoven symphony playing in the background as he beautifully butchers the back bones of a suckling pig. Benihana performances ain't got nothing on Kam Po. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nFOOD:\n\nRoast Pork = Incredible. The skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was unbelievably tender and juicy. We got there a little late, so the meat was a little cold from hanging on the hook throughout the morning, but the juiciness wasn't compromised in any way. I can only imagine how delicious it must be immediately after cooking.\n\nRoast Duck = Pretty good. I'm more of a fan of the Beijing-style roast duck with the crispy skin than this kind, where the skin is soggy from sweet and sour sauce. The meat was very tender, but I just don't really like having it drenched in so much sauce.\n\nPreserved Egg & Pork Porridge = Possibly the best preserved egg porridge I've had in San Francisco. There are so many full flavors packed into this porridge that it makes every bite delicious.\n\nGarlic Sauteed Pea Shoots = Loved it. It's a little oily, but the garlic flavors explode with each bite. The pea shoots are very nicely stir-fried, without being overcooked like they usually are. Keep in mind that it's actually pretty-hilariously written in Chinglish as \"Garlic Pea Sharts\" on the menu. I want to give Kam Po an extra star just for that.\n\nTotal: $20 after tax & tip. Yes, it was seriously that cheap.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nKam Po is like a wonderful slice of the true Chinese neighborhood experience.

And I being Vietnamese and eating authentic food,( Panda Express is good but like saying Taco Bell is Mexican food), decided to get some roast duck.

And it is tasty and filling and all for under $5.  Then to go I get the rice, Roast Duck, and BBQ pork.  Its like getting 2 meals.  Lots of meat, great value and its quick.  Going there is ok but the people who work there are not so english speaking.  But then the food makes it worth it.  My girlfriend and I ate there 3 times in three days before.
