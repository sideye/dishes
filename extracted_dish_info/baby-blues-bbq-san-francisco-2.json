I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The collard greens left us confused (why are they in a tomato sauce??).

So we ordered the one appetizer (Suicide Kings) and the Mason Dixon plate (1/2 rack Memphis Ribs; BBQ chicken breast, 2 sides, cornbread). I'm not sure if they really expect one person to eat that much food.\n\nThe appetizer was strange. It was corn bread topped with pulled pork, something creamy and served with cole slaw. It tasted good when you ate the components separately, but together it was a mish-mash. It was also a lot of food. I would guess it was a 1200 calorie dish. It also arrived at the same time as the entree, defeating the purpose of ordering an appetizer.\n\nThe entree however fell short.

I'm a chicken breast connoisseur, and my chicken breast was completely dried out. Boston Market cooks moister, more flavorful chicken. Portion-wise, it was a ginormous chicken breast, but I had to soak it in sauce to give it any flavor. My boyfriends ribs were also problematic. First, Baby Blues has itsy-bitsy tables that are covered in condiments before you sit down, then the food is served on plastic plates, and their utensils are dollar-store quality. As he tried to cut his ribs apart, the plate kept sliding around on the table until I finally held it in place and then his fork bent backward from the pressure of his index finger. Fortunately it was easy to bend back. (Perfect for Uri Geller)\n\nThey get points for what I assume are recycled chairs, but lose points for the sharp edges underneath that scratched up our fingers.

I remembered the sweetness of the first visit. The onion definitely overpowered the flavor profile.\n\nThe cornbread was different this time too. It was not as dense as our first visit, which I happened to like. The mac 'n cheese was different, this time very wet, the flavor needed some punch. Our first visit it really popped with a nice crust on the top which was missing.\n\nPurist will not like the collard greens in a tomato sauce, but I loved it! Great flavor.

Minus 3 stars, 2 for the ribs sucking and 1 for the lack of effort. Brings them back to 0 stars total.\nSides: we had the mac and cheese, okra, collards greens, corn bread and pork and beans. the mac and cheese was ok, nothing to write home about. the beans weren't thick enough to be baked beans, but the inclusion of pulled pork was a good touch. the okra was ok, and the collard greens were quite tasty. the corn bread had the texture of corn bread, but lacked the corn somehow. I give them 1 star for the sides. \nSo for 1 star, I got the worst ribs i've ever had at a BBQ joint, good prawns, decent brisket and passable sides. and it all cost way too much, over $20 per platter.

However, I was sorely disappointed. \n\nI won't rate them on the service/atmosphere - which were not good - because they just opened. Those things will work themselves out, I'm sure. \n\nI will, however, rate them on the food - which was also not good. I ordered the combination plate - 3 meats, 2 sides and cornbread. I tried to order a sweetened tea and was told they didn't have tea yet ( no tea? I'm pretty sure that's just tea bags, sugar and water requiring no high tech piece of equipment), so water it was. \n\nNow, there are lots of different styles of barbecue - Texas, Kentucky, Memphis, The Carolinas etc. The one thing they all have in common is that rich, smokey, slow-cooked flavor. That flavor was nowhere to be found in the three meats I sampled. The best of the three where the baby back ribs, which were tender but mostly flavorless. My guess is they were mostly boiled and then seared (possibly lightly smoked) but had no barbecue flavor. The pulled pork was completely tasteless (where is that beautiful, almost burnt, caramelized skin you should see on any well barbecued meat?)and the brisket (which was pulled) tasted like it had been sitting in water to keep it moist. It was by far the worst of the three. Every good BBQ cook knows that if you have to slather it in sauce to be edible, you've got problems. \nThe sides went from nondescript and undercooked (collard greens) to strange (black, pinto and kidney?) and tasteless (Baked beans). The corn bread was like no other I've ever tasted (either made with white or yellow cornmeal) and not in a good way. \nHaving said all that, I might actually have given the place another shot...if it wasn't so crazy expensive. The exact same amount of food (and better quality, I might add) can be had at any number of barbecue restaurants in the city for around $16.95. The total for the \"Big Blue\" was $25.95. If you are going to charge those prices - you should be able to back it up with quality. \n\nI hate giving a bad review - I mean, look at how few I've given - but this place needs to step it up.

"], "author": "Jon R.", "review": "Let me start by saying I really want this place to succeed and will try them a few more times before giving up but my first experience last night left a lot to be desired.   I waited a few weeks after opening to try this neighborhood restaurant for a couple reasons.  One is I like to give a new place some time to work out the opening bugs.  The other is signage - or lack thereof.  The restaurant has no exterior signage with the name of the place so I had no idea how to call in a take out order.  My friend Kurt and his boyfriends wound up going this past Tuesday and he brought me a menu yesterday so I knew I would call in an order on my way home.\n\nMy concern continued when I called in a pretty simple order (one whole chicken and three sides) and was told it would be 20 minutes.  OK - I can handle that even though I'd be passing by on my way from 24th St BART to home in about 10 minutes.  So I get there and no one greets me.  There is no signage regarding take out.  I get the attention of the bartender and say I'm early for a take out order and she goes to check but doesn't come back and tell me anything.  The place is LOUD.  Hard surfaces everywhere, a cheap , tinny sound system blaring music and the visual assault of a large screen tuned to ESPN.  I continue to stand by the bar but am not offered a drink - which I would have gladly bought to dull the noise and ease the wait.  \n\nI want to get someone's attention to ask if they can run my card so that when my order is up I can go but the staff is pretty much running in circles.  This became more frustrating as eventually I could see what I was certain was my order bagged and ready.  The person behind the bar approaches me with my check (and not a bag) and I give her my card and she takes it while running to answer the phone.  She stays on the phone a few minutes and returns with my card.  I sign and she runs for the phone again.  I'm waiting and she eventually gets another waiter near her to bring me the bag.  I ask if there is any sauce in it (it's a BBQ joint!) and she says no and goes to get some of each of the two available.  I'm pleasant as I say thanks - now 35 minutes after placing my order - 25 of them observing the chaos under unpleasant conditions.\n\nAnyway - they're new, I'm hopeful and hungry and only a couple blocks from home.  I get home and open the bag.  The sides are already a disappointment in size: three 1/2 pint containers: mashed potatoes (delicious) baked beans (OK but not baked enough - too saucy) and collard greens (pretty good but oddly saucy too).  I plate a little of each then open the chicken package.  Smells good and looks like a lot but wait something's wrong.  I mentioned I ordered a whole chicken and expected to see just that - perhaps cut in 1/4s but would have been fine whole.  Instead there are four 1/4s.  Now none of my friends would confuse me for a breast man and that goes for my taste in chicken too.  But the four 1/4s I was looking at were all breast/wing 1/4s.  Four of 'em.  I was looking forward to a leg/thigh which, to me, tastes better and also stays moister through a long smoking and would have left the expected two breasts for my roommate later or myself if super tasty.  \n\nSo, already disappointed on a lot of levels I cut up a breast/wing and no way this spent a long time in a smoker.  Roadside, for example, smokes their chickens 4 hours (and their pulled pork and brisket for 17!)  so that it's falling off the bone but this was actually difficult to separate the wing.  Don't get me wrong -  I am not saying it was undercooked - it was fully cooked - but not slow smoked by a long shot.\n\nLast straw - I spent $30 on one chicken and three sides an no corn muffins?  \"They come with all the meals and this is the same as two meals and there should have been at least a couple in there.  I'm pretty sure I didn't see them in the sides section or I would have even bought them.\n\nLike I said, I *really* want to like this place and for it to succeed.  It's joined a neighborhood of very good restaurants who all do a large amount of take out so they will need to streamline that operation: signage, promptness, something to do while waiting - like selling me a drink - would all be good starters.\n\nI'd like to see them publish their smoke times, temperatures and woods used - BBQ eaters care about these things.  And BBQ eaters who do their own smoking (like me in a Kamado) *really *care.  \n\nI'll try more of their sides too - but think the portions should be full pints when a la carte at that price: they are as GFC up the street and at Petes @ 20th.  \n\nI'm very happy to see catfish and shrimp on the menu which don't require long smoking for flavor/tenderness but am leery of the ribs and brisket if they are anything like the chicken.  And finally, when someone orders a whole chicken - give them one - preferably from one bird but at list try and replicate the parts from one.  \n\nI promise to be back soon - hope it gets better.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-02-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I love the Mack and Cheese, Okra, and Collard Greens.\n\n"], "author": "Marvin A.", "review": "Huge fan.

The staff at this place is stellar hence the two stars...however that is their only saving grace!! Once we were seated our server was nice and informed us that they were out of both sweet tea and unsweetened tea.....while reviewing the menu he was also very helpful in answering our questions about what was good and what was not.\n\nMy husband and I shared a mixed meat plate I believe it was the Baby Blues Plate...we got SHredded Beef...Pork Ribs (Memphis) and Chicken....our friends ordered a mixed plate as well with Catfish...Ribs..Chicken...Shrimp...so needless to say we had all of the meats covered at our table....we also got the Okras...Creamed Spinach...Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens. It took them almost an hour to bring our order over to us...not once did they check in to say that it would be right up or to bring the sodas that we ordered to replace the very awful tasting \"blue kool aid\" (I mean who messes up Kool Aid but that is another story). It would have been helpful to at least have some cornbread to eat since we were starving!! It was also at this point that I realized our wait had been this long based on the fact that the kitchen took a looooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg time to get the food prepared and to the tables.\n\nThe food came just as we were about to eat our arms off...The meat was luke warm and over cooked. The chicken was dry and did not taste good at all in fact all I could taste was charred over-cooked meat. I even got dark meat...dry dark meat just ain't right...in fact it is down right NASTY. The Catfish had a gassy after taste no doubt from the gas grill being used. The ribs were ok nothing to write home about  but I can do better ribs in my oven and the shrimp was decent....although it was a little over cooked but I can forgive that. I asked the server why it took such a long time to get our food to the table and he said...\"they just opened and they are still trying to figure things out\" We also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out... our server did say \"at least we did not run out of ribs this time\" We ended up ordering cold pecan pie which was not bad and cold peach betty/cobbler... Cobbler should be warm with vanilla ice cream...I think they offer these two dishes cold so that they can be made ahead and get to your table before the night turns into day!! The peach betty was ok but they used canned peaches which for me is unforgiveable.....\n\nHaving eaten BBQ in North Carolina....Kansas City and Georgia this ain't cutting it for me!! The meat lacked so much in so many ways.... I was not impressed with the wait time...the food or for that matter the decor. If the food was good I could get over having to wait for it...with so many yummy dining options in the mission I would for sure pass this one up. If their meats are slow cooked for 18 hours then the flavor and taste should be tasted all the way to the bones...there was little to no flavor in anything that I ate last night. I really wanted to like this place because I love me some BBQ but once again San Francisco has proved itself to be a foodie paradise in many ways but not when it comes to BBQ.

I'd suggest making reservations, when we left all the tables were full. I think if you didn't have reservations, they sat you at the communal table.\nI'm a planner in all aspects of life. So much so, that I looked at the menu and decided on my dish. For starters, we had the Suicide King with pork,  I got the Bones, No Bones, hubby got the Memphis Queen and of course the kids got the chicken strips and mac and cheese.\n\nStarter: The cornbread was tasty and crubmbly. It was on the sweeter side, which was ok.  The pork and coleslaw  was fine, nothing exciting about it.\nHowever, the BBQ sauces that they had on the table are to DIE FOR!!! They should sell them!!!  A lot better than what you can get from the grocery store. I was dousing all my meat in it. My combination was the sweet sauce along with their spicy one. \n\nMain dishes: I was a little disappointed, our meat was room temperature. I'm sure it would have been better if it was hot. Also, I was looking forward to sliced beef brisket and not shredded beef brisket. Insert sad face here!\n\nThe mac and cheese tasted strange.... I think it was the cheese they used??. nMy kids didn't even finish theirs! And they can eat mac and cheese for days! Even the stuff out of the box!\n\nService:  Spotty throughout the night.

The shrimp was the only thing on the place that was OK. They were overcooked slightly but seasoned well. The rice was edible but completely forgettable. It all goes downhill from there...\n\nThe brisket is so far removed from \"good brisket\" that I can't really do it justice. It's dry and stringy beef. They carve it along the bias, rather than against it, which is a major no-no. You will chew this stuff for days. There's no crust and no juiciness. Major fail.\n\nThe mac and cheese seemed like it had gone through a food processor or a blender. It was just cheesy mush without any discernable structure of noodle. (How is it possible to mess up mac and cheese?)\n\nThe \"creamed spinach\" is basically raw/blanched spinach with some white sauce slapped on it. Zero flavor. Fail.\n\nThe okra had giant, fibrous stalks in it that were basically inedible. Every third or forth bite, I had to reach into my mouth and pull out a 3\" long mess of plant stalk that simply refused to break down in my chewing.\n\nLast (and possible least) is the cornbread. I have had much better out of a box. It's either soaked in butter or oil (probably to make it less dry?) but it's a dense brick of a corn-tasting substance and I felt dirty for eating it.\n\nI will gladly drive across town to Memphis Minnies from here on out.

Like the dry rub style.  While the meat was tender, the outside was a bit over cooked.  I'm into the contrast, but I think the outside should have been less tough.  Still, very good, and great with the sauces.  \n\nI used the \"Original Sauce\" and then mixed it with one of their hotter sauces, which I think was Tabasco-based.  That's not my thing because Tabasco, if it actually was that, has such a unique flavor it almost dominates the hot.  Rather they use a lesser known sauce; something I'm not familiar with.  However, I mixed the two, and again, damn good.\n\nChicken was cooked to PERFECTION.  The Moms made a legendary chicken, and my friends back in Jersey have won AWARDS (www.localsmokebbq.com) for their chicken.

I was also happy to see they deliver.\nWe went on a Friday night and were told the wait would be an hour. I thought that was quite strange - as I have been in literally hundreds of BBQ joints all over the country and never had to wait. Stand in line, maybe, but not actually wait. I mean, the meat is already cooked, right? It's not as if the waitperson has to send an order to the kitchen to cook. The only BBQ places I've been to that had wait people maybe had them to refill your iced tea or - on rare occasions - to take your order and bring it to the table. But the whole point of BBQ is that it starts smoking early in the morning and is all ready when the place opens - so waiting an hour was quite confusing. Oh well, we had movie tickets, so we left and thought we would try it again soon. So Sunday we were having friends over and we thought we would try the delivery. \nThe food arrived and they had forgotten a few items. No biggie - new places always have kinks to work out. We called them and the super nice staff was very apologetic and promptly re-delivered the missing items. We had ordered the Baby Backs, brisket, and pulled pork with sides of beans, cole slaw, and mac and cheese. I was a bit leery because the meat didn't *smell* like BBQ. There was no spicy and smoky aroma. Yet I held out hope - thinking all that really mattered was the taste. This is where the trouble is - there is no taste. The meat is obviously cooked in an oven - not smoked. Thus it is NOT BBQ under any reasonable definition.\nWhat a bummer. I thought with their \"down-home\" branding and image they would at least raise to the lowest common BBQ denominator of selling smoked meat. I know we're in San Francisco and most people here have never had real BBQ - but still! Yes, I was previously suspicious when I've passed by and saw no woodpile, no smokers, no smoke - nothing to indicate it was a BBQ joint - but I assumed they must smoke off-site somewhere and bring the meat in. WRONG. They cook it in ovens and finish the ribs on a gas grill.\nSince it's not BBQ, not in cooking method or flavor - it's a bit pointless to review the meat. I will say the brisket by-the-pound was shredded - which as a BBQ aficionado - I've never had except in a sandwich. The pulled pork was lean and really flavorless. I mean, you do need some fat and you need it to be partly rendered out by slow smoking. That is just what BBQ is by definition. The ribs were OK - but I can make better oven-cooked ribs at home, if that's what I'm looking for.\nThe sides were very lackluster - the beans were a bland mixture of black beans, pinto beans, and a few others without the smoky-sweet-spicy taste of traditional BBQ beans. The mac and cheese just tasted of torn noodles and fat - not much cheese flavor and the advertised blue cheese was nowhere to be seen (or tasted.) The slaw was edible. The BBQ sauce was quite sweet and just lacked any soul or personality (which, I guess, is a perfect match to the meat.)\nThey have a very hip space, a really nice staff, and very reasonable prices for The City - but I just can't overlook the glaring fact that they're not selling BBQ.

I for some reason thought it was a one time thing and decided to give them a chance anyway based on the fact that much is forgiven if the food is bombtastic. We waited for over 45 mins for a table last night....every 20 mins it was another 20 mins..it was busy and I get that sometimes you have to wait for good food. The staff at this place is stellar hence the two stars...however that is their only saving grace!! Once we were seated our server was nice and informed us that they were out of both sweet tea and unsweetened tea.....while reviewing the menu he was also very helpful in answering our questions about what was good and what was not.\n\nMy husband and I shared a mixed meat plate I believe it was the Baby Blues Plate...we got SHredded Beef...Pork Ribs (Memphis) and Chicken....our friends ordered a mixed plate as well with Catfish...Ribs..Chicken...Shrimp...so needless to say we had all of the meats covered at our table....we also got the Okras...Creamed Spinach...Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens. It took them almost an hour to bring our order over to us...not once did they check in to say that it would be right up or to bring the sodas that we ordered to replace the very awful tasting \"blue kool aid\" (I mean who messes up Kool Aid but that is another story). It would have been helpful to at least have some cornbread to eat since we were starving!! It was also at this point that I realized our wait had been this long based on the fact that the kitchen took a looooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg time to get the food prepared and to the tables.\n\nThe food came just as we were about to eat our arms off...The meat was luke warm and over cooked. The chicken was dry and did not taste good at all in fact all I could taste was charred over-cooked meat. I even got dark meat...dry dark meat just ain't right...in fact it is down right NASTY. The Catfish had a gassy after taste no doubt from the gas grill being used. The ribs were ok nothing to write home about  but I can do better ribs in my oven and the shrimp was decent....although it was a little over cooked but I can forgive that. I asked the server why it took such a long time to get our food to the table and he said...\"they just opened and they are still trying to figure things out\" We also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out... our server did say \"at least we did not run out of ribs this time\" We ended up ordering cold pecan pie which was not bad and cold peach betty/cobbler... Cobbler should be warm with vanilla ice cream...I think they offer these two dishes cold so that they can be made ahead and get to your table before the night turns into day!! The peach betty was ok but they used canned peaches which for me is unforgiveable.....\n\nHaving eaten BBQ in North Carolina....Kansas City and Georgia this ain't cutting it for me!! The meat lacked so much in so many ways.... I was not impressed with the wait time...the food or for that matter the decor. If the food was good I could get over having to wait for it...with so many yummy dining options in the mission I would for sure pass this one up. If their meats are slow cooked for 18 hours then the flavor and taste should be tasted all the way to the bones...there was little to no flavor in anything that I ate last night. I really wanted to like this place because I love me some BBQ but once again San Francisco has proved itself to be a foodie paradise in many ways but not when it comes to BBQ.

And the worse of the three was the dry and rubbery bbq chicken tasted like cafeteria food or something you would get in the freezer aisle. For the sides we ordered the runny, bland potato salad, and the mac and cheese that was okay.

The mashed potatoes were good the first time, tasted weird the second time. The BBQ is less than average. Not impressive. I've been twice, the ribs were a dried out and some were basically charcoal on a bone. The brisket was at least edible. Both flavorless, with a crappy bland sweet sauce.  The sauce tastes pretty generic and very sugary, like they bought it from Safeway, added water and sugar, then over sauced the meat with it to cover up that it is burnt and bland. There is a difference between the charred flavor of food done on a grill or BBQ and just plain burnt.  Corn bread was a little weird, with actual corn kernels in it and kind of dry on the outside and soggy on the bottom. Maybe that's a southern thing that I don't get cause I'm from the pacific NW.  Another reviewer commented that her burger was way over done. I would have to agree. My friend ordered medium and it was definitely medium well. Also, the mashed sweet potatoes tasted good, but the texture made me gag. They didn't mash them well and there were a lot of little stringy fiber things left in.  Maybe below average is what you get from a chain restaurant (or is it a franchise?), who's other restaurant is in So Cal and not from Memphis.?!

Not long ago I was in Texas and got all kinds of conflicting advice about where to go for barbeque, with explicit opinions that reminded me of, well, asking people what denomination was the best.  Lots of dreamy looks when talking about their favorite, and lots of fiery indignation when talking about the other (whoever the other may be). \n\nI'm sure that if Baby Blues was in Texas there'd be some polarization about the place, possibly at the same level there is from what I'm seeing in the reviews here.  Though personally, I really don't see what's not to like about this place.  Attentive, knowledgeable service: as shown by our waitress who checked in regularly and came over to tell us about the several cheeses in the mac & cheese.  A good location: as evidenced by being able to park within a block of the place, right on the street, no problem.  A nice space: good light, a good view of the street, comfortable chairs, and all that.  A good beer and (short, but adequate) wine list.  \n\nAnd right, the food.  We had brisket, pulled pork, a link, baby back ribs, slaw, potato salad, mac & cheese, and corn bread.  The brisket was properly cooked and prepared, as was the pork.  The link was surprisingly spicy (though easy to handle) and good, too.  The ribs were just right as well, bone-gnawingly delicious.  The buttermilk style slaw was exactly the way I prefer it - more savory than sweet, crunchy, fresh, generously portioned.  The flavors of the potato salad were spot on, and while I thought the potato bits were a bit larger than they should have been, the lack of uniformity bespoke a home-madedness that overcomes that kind of quibble.  The corn bread is in the traditional, savory style as well - I like the cake-style better, but I can recognize that for folks who like cornbread in this way it was very nicely done.  The mac & cheese was, well, divine.  The different cheeses complimented each other very nicely, adding a great depth to the side that my date and I loved.  \n\nI'm not from a major BBQ producing region of the country so I don't have much of a vested interest in the style one way or the other.  Memphis, Texas, Carolina; pig, beef, chicken; cheesy mac, cole slaw, potato salad: whatever's there, I'll eat and if it's good I'll like it.  So I don't have a problem with the fusion aspect of barbeque here.  And the portions are generous enough that my date and I split a Blue Devil and had leftovers for the next day.\n\nSo three meals from one ($30) entree, which I think puts a good spin on their price points, which I though were reasonable.

Or just stop at Baby Blues.\n\nWe were first acquainted in the Inner Richmond: http://www.yelp.com/biz/irelands-32-san-francisco?hrid=u3x2Fh8fMVtzu5PxIsCe3w\n\nAt the original location we took the relationship a step further with a quarter serving of smoked chicken, baked beans and a piece of cornbread.\n\nIt was an impressive platter for $9. Chicken portion was quite generous and the beans featured an assortment of legumes. Both were delicious.\n\nSit inside and choose a view of Mission Street or televisions playing the latest game. Don't forget the five BBQ sauce sampler. Sweet molasses with a kick is my favorite.\n\nFriendly staff was juggling a few different tasks so it took a while for my order to be taken.

Celebrating with her nearest and dearest friends...a very fun time no matter where we were.... \n\nI arrived first and, while I did not get anyone's names, I was greeted by the cutest hostess in a black fedora. Sweet, welcoming and warm! And it only got better from there, folks! \n\nAs another member of this party arrived, fedora girl seated us at a table towards the back wall. The place smells of real BBQ which gets your juices flowing well before your food gets to you. The noise level is on the loud side and as much as I usually don't like noisy places, at Baby Blues it actually imparts a friendly homey spirit throughout the place. \n\nOnce the rest of our party arrived and sat down, the waitress was sweet but really really busy so didn't get back to us quite as quickly as we might've liked (we were all overcome by all the delicious smells and ready to chow down!). Still and all, our food arrived and......OMG! So good! In fact, as I'm writing this my mouth is watering just at the memory of last night!!!\n\nThe menu offers lots of combination plates do you don't need to choose one or the other from your barbecue favorites. For me personally though, I ordered the half rack of baby backs with two sides. And it was plenty!!! As I said at the beginning of my review, my ribs were rather fatty and made me wonder if they were not baby backs. Regardless, they were tasty, meaty and really good! The corn bread was so-so but then again not so important to me. Also I ordered the Baby Blue salad and it was de-lish. The  vegetarian baked beans looked to me like it was made with three beans not one kind. Really tasty! \n\nIt's easy to order too much food here! The BBQ smell when you walk in the door starts your taste buds working so by the time you order you want everything on the menu! \n\nI plan going back again.

And I love how there are signs up still advertising \"DRUGS.\" \n\nBaby Blues BBQ made such a fantastic first impression on us that we came back twice in one week. I couldn't get my mind off of them. Here are my notes:\n\nVisit #1: Late lunch: we walk into an enormous space with Bob Marley on the speakers & are greeted by our waitress telling us to take a seat anywhere we'd like (the only other patrons were at the bar, enjoying their liquid lunch, i assume.) We pass up the communal table & the bar & opt for a seat on the bench along the wall. \n\nThe lunch specials, served from 12-4pm, are well priced at under $13 for sandwiches & meats combos, but I noticed their \"platters\" are priced higher than other BBQ joints in the city. We shared \"The Blue Devil:\" 4 meats & 3 \"fixins\" for $31.95. (Roadside BBQ on Geary charges $23 & i think Memphis Minnies does 3 meats/2 sides for $20.) \n\nTheir BBQ shrimp, which I've never had at a BBQ joint, gets 5 stars. They were large, a little spicy from the sauce & grilled to perfection. Honestly, they were the reason we came back. I also really enjoyed their sides; blues on the cob (sprinkled w/ cheese) & mac & cheese were both excellent.\n\nI could take or leave: their brisket (pulled & shredded--never seen brisket done this way before) & their beef ribs, which were meaty but also fatty. (Not all beef ribs are fatty--case in point: the ones from Roadside BBQ.) Their corn bread is moist & full of corn, but there is a spice in it (which I can't identify) that gives it a pungent taste I don't particularly care for. \n\nDid not try: pulled pork & chicken smoked rice. According to the bf, both were so-so.\n\nTheir BBQ sauces are watery, but still quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Ginger Tabasco the most. \n_________________________________\n\nVisit #2: Late dinner, right before they were set to close. We walk in & are seated near the ukuleles. The place looks different when dim; definitely very festive w/ Christmas lights & dancehall playing loudly. I'm seeing details & decorations I missed the first time around & dig the eclectic mishmash of items. \n\nWe order \"Big Blue\" which is 3 meats w/ 2 fixins for $25.95. They ran out of BBQ chicken (which the bf was excited to try) so in addition to baby back ribs, we doubled up on our shrimp order. The shrimp were as succulent as we remembered (altho I think we were a few shrimp shy of a double portion...) Their baby back ribs were wonderful; it had a nice crust & wasn't too smoky. Again, the sides (mashed potatoes w/ some skin left in it & baked beans) were a hit. I liked their banana pudding, but the bf commented it just tasted like banana flavored whipped cream (which means I don't have to share.)\n\nWe've been here once when it was pretty empty & once when it was packed & our servers have always been great; they're quick & get our orders right. Love the location, love the atmosphere & most importantly, love (most of the) food.

We arrived just before 5 pm this past Sunday.  We walked in, and the bartender looked at us and decided to help the people that came in AFTER us, who apparently came in to get take-out.  There's no sign that says \"wait to be seated\", so we weren't sure if we should just try to find our own seats.  There were a total of 6 people seated at tables eating/ordering, and about 4 people at the bar.  It appeared that there was only one waitress for the whole place.\n\nThe bartender finally looks up and asks us how many?  3.  Then he basically tells us to sit wherever.  Thanks, we couldn't have figured that out a couple minutes ago.  We sit down, and a waitress brings us the menus.  The bartender comes to take our orders.

We were never told \"goodbye, and here's my replacement\" by the original waitress, no one came to check and see how everything was, no one offered refills or more drinks.  We were clearly finished eating when the new waitress took my boyfriends beer glass away, but she never offered to clear our plates, or ask if we wanted to take anything home.  It took about 20 minutes to get our bill, and that was from the bartender, and they STILL never cleaned our table.

I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The baked beans were full of flavor....both BBQ sauces (regular and XXX) were yummmy, they have Blue Moon beer and the service was on it!\n"], "author": "Jon C.", "review": "Solid Solid Solid.

The potato salad which I absolutely adored, had gone south. My first bite was raw onion, bitter, sharp, unpleasant. Lots of skins in there  as well from the red potatoes. I remembered the sweetness of the first visit. The onion definitely overpowered the flavor profile.\n\nThe cornbread was different this time too. It was not as dense as our first visit, which I happened to like. The mac 'n cheese was different, this time very wet, the flavor needed some punch.

I tried to order a sweetened tea and was told they didn't have tea yet ( no tea? I'm pretty sure that's just tea bags, sugar and water requiring no high tech piece of equipment), so water it was. \n\nNow, there are lots of different styles of barbecue - Texas, Kentucky, Memphis, The Carolinas etc. The one thing they all have in common is that rich, smokey, slow-cooked flavor. That flavor was nowhere to be found in the three meats I sampled. The best of the three where the baby back ribs, which were tender but mostly flavorless. My guess is they were mostly boiled and then seared (possibly lightly smoked) but had no barbecue flavor. The pulled pork was completely tasteless (where is that beautiful, almost burnt, caramelized skin you should see on any well barbecued meat?)and the brisket (which was pulled) tasted like it had been sitting in water to keep it moist. It was by far the worst of the three. Every good BBQ cook knows that if you have to slather it in sauce to be edible, you've got problems. \nThe sides went from nondescript and undercooked (collard greens) to strange (black, pinto and kidney?) and tasteless (Baked beans).

The exact same amount of food (and better quality, I might add) can be had at any number of barbecue restaurants in the city for around $16.95. The total for the \"Big Blue\" was $25.95.

"], "author": "Jon R.", "review": "Let me start by saying I really want this place to succeed and will try them a few more times before giving up but my first experience last night left a lot to be desired.   I waited a few weeks after opening to try this neighborhood restaurant for a couple reasons.  One is I like to give a new place some time to work out the opening bugs.  The other is signage - or lack thereof.  The restaurant has no exterior signage with the name of the place so I had no idea how to call in a take out order.  My friend Kurt and his boyfriends wound up going this past Tuesday and he brought me a menu yesterday so I knew I would call in an order on my way home.\n\nMy concern continued when I called in a pretty simple order (one whole chicken and three sides) and was told it would be 20 minutes.  OK - I can handle that even though I'd be passing by on my way from 24th St BART to home in about 10 minutes.  So I get there and no one greets me.  There is no signage regarding take out.  I get the attention of the bartender and say I'm early for a take out order and she goes to check but doesn't come back and tell me anything.  The place is LOUD.  Hard surfaces everywhere, a cheap , tinny sound system blaring music and the visual assault of a large screen tuned to ESPN.  I continue to stand by the bar but am not offered a drink - which I would have gladly bought to dull the noise and ease the wait.  \n\nI want to get someone's attention to ask if they can run my card so that when my order is up I can go but the staff is pretty much running in circles.  This became more frustrating as eventually I could see what I was certain was my order bagged and ready.  The person behind the bar approaches me with my check (and not a bag) and I give her my card and she takes it while running to answer the phone.  She stays on the phone a few minutes and returns with my card.  I sign and she runs for the phone again.  I'm waiting and she eventually gets another waiter near her to bring me the bag.  I ask if there is any sauce in it (it's a BBQ joint!) and she says no and goes to get some of each of the two available.  I'm pleasant as I say thanks - now 35 minutes after placing my order - 25 of them observing the chaos under unpleasant conditions.\n\nAnyway - they're new, I'm hopeful and hungry and only a couple blocks from home.  I get home and open the bag.  The sides are already a disappointment in size: three 1/2 pint containers: mashed potatoes (delicious) baked beans (OK but not baked enough - too saucy) and collard greens (pretty good but oddly saucy too).  I plate a little of each then open the chicken package.  Smells good and looks like a lot but wait something's wrong.  I mentioned I ordered a whole chicken and expected to see just that - perhaps cut in 1/4s but would have been fine whole.  Instead there are four 1/4s.  Now none of my friends would confuse me for a breast man and that goes for my taste in chicken too.  But the four 1/4s I was looking at were all breast/wing 1/4s.  Four of 'em.  I was looking forward to a leg/thigh which, to me, tastes better and also stays moister through a long smoking and would have left the expected two breasts for my roommate later or myself if super tasty.  \n\nSo, already disappointed on a lot of levels I cut up a breast/wing and no way this spent a long time in a smoker.  Roadside, for example, smokes their chickens 4 hours (and their pulled pork and brisket for 17!)  so that it's falling off the bone but this was actually difficult to separate the wing.  Don't get me wrong -  I am not saying it was undercooked - it was fully cooked - but not slow smoked by a long shot.\n\nLast straw - I spent $30 on one chicken and three sides an no corn muffins?  \"They come with all the meals and this is the same as two meals and there should have been at least a couple in there.  I'm pretty sure I didn't see them in the sides section or I would have even bought them.\n\nLike I said, I *really* want to like this place and for it to succeed.  It's joined a neighborhood of very good restaurants who all do a large amount of take out so they will need to streamline that operation: signage, promptness, something to do while waiting - like selling me a drink - would all be good starters.\n\nI'd like to see them publish their smoke times, temperatures and woods used - BBQ eaters care about these things.  And BBQ eaters who do their own smoking (like me in a Kamado) *really *care.  \n\nI'll try more of their sides too - but think the portions should be full pints when a la carte at that price: they are as GFC up the street and at Petes @ 20th.  \n\nI'm very happy to see catfish and shrimp on the menu which don't require long smoking for flavor/tenderness but am leery of the ribs and brisket if they are anything like the chicken.  And finally, when someone orders a whole chicken - give them one - preferably from one bird but at list try and replicate the parts from one.  \n\nI promise to be back soon - hope it gets better.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-02-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The baked beans and cornbread were pretty blah.

One person said he would go back to Baby Blues just for the shrimp.  Guess I should have ordered it.\n\nSides:  The sides were good but the only one that was exceptional was the mac and cheese.

Kinda sorta. \n\nThere is plenty of street parking and we went on a Saturday afternoon. We got there at 12:30 and the place was completely empty. That kind of freaked me out. We ordered The Deuce and he got a side of 1/4 Chicken. He chose Coleslaw and Mac and Cheese for his sides. \n\nThe food came out pretty fast which wasn't a huge surprise considering we were the only ones there. This was a nice sunny Saturday mind you. I love that there are four different types of sauces on every table that look home made and they have cute names like Sassy Molassey. \n\nThe Deuce came with 6 BBQ shrimp with some sauce drizzled over it. I took a bite and bam, an explosion of flavor. It was soooo good. I couldn't believe it. These were jumbo meaty shrimps too. Nomnomnom. The mac and cheese looked disgusting but I couldn't stop eating it once I started! I almost didn't eat it too. The sauce wasn't really a sauce. It was just lots of melted cheese so it was really thick (and awesome). The coleslaw had a really strange taste that I couldn't put my finger on. My bf thinks it was mustard seed. It was good though. It also came with a huge slab of corn bread which I thought was just okay. I really only like super sweet corn cakes but my bf liked it. \n\nI can't say anything about the meat. I think my bf said it was kind of over cooked or something. He didn't finish all his chicken. The food is a little pricey but the 1/4 chicken is only 4.95 for some reason which is super cheap and the size was huge! You could definitely make a meal out of just that. \n\nWe didn't eat any dessert because we were stuffed and had to go to dinner later that night for my friends birthday at Esperpento (horrible btw, don't go!). \n\nThe decor was amazing! I loved it. Great job on mixing western and modern. I've never seen anything like it before. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated and clean. \n\nService was nice.

We didn't notice till after that they have a bunch of lunch specials that all the other patrons who finally came in later ordered. Its on the back of their menu and they are pretty reasonably priced. I think they were around $11.95. \n\nI asked for a take out menu but the owner (?) said they didn't have any because they're redoing  their menu and are reprinting menus. Eek! I hope they don't make any negative changes. I'll definitely be back.

The bar staff lined up the sauces from me from not spicy to spicy (4 bottles) and i was able to handle the first 3. What I noticed, the meat was bland and the the sauces gave the taste and moisture necessary. I did enjoy the sauces and really liked eating the BBQ with it. I'm not use to BBQ where you rely on the compliments of the sauce so it was different for me as I usually take my BBQ dry rub. But it was good all and all.

And I love how there are signs up still advertising \"DRUGS.\" \n\nBaby Blues BBQ made such a fantastic first impression on us that we came back twice in one week. I couldn't get my mind off of them. Here are my notes:\n\nVisit #1: Late lunch: we walk into an enormous space with Bob Marley on the speakers & are greeted by our waitress telling us to take a seat anywhere we'd like (the only other patrons were at the bar, enjoying their liquid lunch, i assume.) We pass up the communal table & the bar & opt for a seat on the bench along the wall. \n\nThe lunch specials, served from 12-4pm, are well priced at under $13 for sandwiches & meats combos, but I noticed their \"platters\" are priced higher than other BBQ joints in the city. We shared \"The Blue Devil:\" 4 meats & 3 \"fixins\" for $31.95. (Roadside BBQ on Geary charges $23 & i think Memphis Minnies does 3 meats/2 sides for $20.) \n\nTheir BBQ shrimp, which I've never had at a BBQ joint, gets 5 stars. They were large, a little spicy from the sauce & grilled to perfection. Honestly, they were the reason we came back. I also really enjoyed their sides; blues on the cob (sprinkled w/ cheese) & mac & cheese were both excellent.\n\nI could take or leave: their brisket (pulled & shredded--never seen brisket done this way before) & their beef ribs, which were meaty but also fatty. (Not all beef ribs are fatty--case in point: the ones from Roadside BBQ.) Their corn bread is moist & full of corn, but there is a spice in it (which I can't identify) that gives it a pungent taste I don't particularly care for. \n\nDid not try: pulled pork & chicken smoked rice. According to the bf, both were so-so.\n\nTheir BBQ sauces are watery, but still quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Ginger Tabasco the most. \n_________________________________\n\nVisit #2: Late dinner, right before they were set to close. We walk in & are seated near the ukuleles. The place looks different when dim; definitely very festive w/ Christmas lights & dancehall playing loudly. I'm seeing details & decorations I missed the first time around & dig the eclectic mishmash of items. \n\nWe order \"Big Blue\" which is 3 meats w/ 2 fixins for $25.95. They ran out of BBQ chicken (which the bf was excited to try) so in addition to baby back ribs, we doubled up on our shrimp order. The shrimp were as succulent as we remembered (altho I think we were a few shrimp shy of a double portion...) Their baby back ribs were wonderful; it had a nice crust & wasn't too smoky. Again, the sides (mashed potatoes w/ some skin left in it & baked beans) were a hit. I liked their banana pudding, but the bf commented it just tasted like banana flavored whipped cream (which means I don't have to share.)\n\nWe've been here once when it was pretty empty & once when it was packed & our servers have always been great; they're quick & get our orders right.

I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["And the corn bread was something special too.\n\n"], "author": "Nato G.", "review": "Since the word hit the street that this would be barbecue mere stumbling distance from my place, I've been counting the moments until I could stuff my face with carcass.

I knew that this was a risk for disappointment since I'm an Eastern NC raised girl.  Perhaps, I should have gone with the Memphis Queen platter, as other reviewers enjoyed it.  I really wasn't impressed with the pork.  There was not much flavor or spice to it, like NC pulled pork bbq.  In fact, the sauce that was suggested to us for use really didn't have the tang that I'm accustomed to using with pork bbq.  The sides were adequately portioned, but I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of corn bread.  The mac and cheese was alright, the chicken smoked rice was dry and bland.

So we ordered the one appetizer (Suicide Kings) and the Mason Dixon plate (1/2 rack Memphis Ribs; BBQ chicken breast, 2 sides, cornbread). I'm not sure if they really expect one person to eat that much food.\n\nThe appetizer was strange. It was corn bread topped with pulled pork, something creamy and served with cole slaw. It tasted good when you ate the components separately, but together it was a mish-mash. It was also a lot of food. I would guess it was a 1200 calorie dish. It also arrived at the same time as the entree, defeating the purpose of ordering an appetizer.\n\nThe entree however fell short. First, the choices for side dishes (Fixins) are all starches or fats with the exception of the collard greens and the stewed tomatoes. My man hates stewed tomatoes, so we ordered the collard greens and the mashed sweet potato. The collard greens were cooked in a stewed tomato sauce. (Sorry Muffin.) I thought the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like baby food, my boyfriend thought they tasted more like lamb food.\n\nThe biggest problem however was the meat. I'm a chicken breast connoisseur, and my chicken breast was completely dried out. Boston Market cooks moister, more flavorful chicken. Portion-wise, it was a ginormous chicken breast, but I had to soak it in sauce to give it any flavor. My boyfriends ribs were also problematic. First, Baby Blues has itsy-bitsy tables that are covered in condiments before you sit down, then the food is served on plastic plates, and their utensils are dollar-store quality. As he tried to cut his ribs apart, the plate kept sliding around on the table until I finally held it in place and then his fork bent backward from the pressure of his index finger. Fortunately it was easy to bend back. (Perfect for Uri Geller)\n\nThey get points for what I assume are recycled chairs, but lose points for the sharp edges underneath that scratched up our fingers.

Baby Blues BBQ is shiny and new on the one hand, full of excitement and anticipation when you enter, but on the other, it has kinks that need to be worked out still. There's a big common table, a counter, and a bunch of tables. Great for families and larger groups (if you don't mind the wait). The decor was a bit spartan, with a few art pieces over freshly painted walls. The staff was top-notch (very friendly, helpful, and working as fast as they can), though with the big crowd, it was noticeable that they haven't gotten into a rhythm yet. That being said, they are off to an impressive start, and I expect as things settle in, the place will only get better.\n\nI had the baby back ribs, beef brisket, and blackened catfish. Sides included okra and mac and cheese. The highlight was the ribs. If you go, just get the ribs. The catfish didn't taste that fresh, and was a bit over-blackened, but again the ribs were great (did I mention the ribs?). The sides, were decent as well. Okra was cooked the right way (non-slimy), a bit on the over-salted-side, but the roasted tomato helped offset that. The mac and cheese wasn't that goopy stuff that some other restaurants have, but it was nicely baked. For dessert, we had the banana pudding. Now, that doesn't sound like the most fascinating of desserts, but it was damn good. Corn bread was superb as well.\n\nGood beer and wine selection, as well as beverages such as sweet tea. If you enjoy spicy foods, ask for the XXX BBQ sauce (if it isn't at your table already). It's the bomb.\n\nIf I were to judge purely on food, decor, and price, I'd give 3 stars, but given that the ribs were great, that they put their heart into things, and that they've just opened, I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. \n\nI look forward to coming back, and trying out their other offerings.

My guess is they were mostly boiled and then seared (possibly lightly smoked) but had no barbecue flavor. The pulled pork was completely tasteless (where is that beautiful, almost burnt, caramelized skin you should see on any well barbecued meat?)and the brisket (which was pulled) tasted like it had been sitting in water to keep it moist.

Though personally, I really don't see what's not to like about this place.  Attentive, knowledgeable service: as shown by our waitress who checked in regularly and came over to tell us about the several cheeses in the mac & cheese.  A good location: as evidenced by being able to park within a block of the place, right on the street, no problem.  A nice space: good light, a good view of the street, comfortable chairs, and all that.  A good beer and (short, but adequate) wine list.  \n\nAnd right, the food.  We had brisket, pulled pork, a link, baby back ribs, slaw, potato salad, mac & cheese, and corn bread.  The brisket was properly cooked and prepared, as was the pork.  The link was surprisingly spicy (though easy to handle) and good, too.  The ribs were just right as well, bone-gnawingly delicious.  The buttermilk style slaw was exactly the way I prefer it - more savory than sweet, crunchy, fresh, generously portioned.

The mac & cheese was, well, divine.  The different cheeses complimented each other very nicely, adding a great depth to the side that my date and I loved.  \n\nI'm not from a major BBQ producing region of the country so I don't have much of a vested interest in the style one way or the other.  Memphis, Texas, Carolina; pig, beef, chicken; cheesy mac, cole slaw, potato salad: whatever's there, I'll eat and if it's good I'll like it.  So I don't have a problem with the fusion aspect of barbeque here.

I love BBQ so I was willing to try it.\n\nLet me start by saying I'm a big fan of Everett and Jones BBQ in Jack London Square because of their Briskett and their Spicy BBQ Sauce.\n\nWe were seated quickly, the place was full, loved the fact that the bar serves plenty of pulled beers especially Guiness! I opted for iced tea; they offer regular (not flavored thank god) and sweet tea; unlimited refilss too!\n\nThe menu is amazing, lots to choose from, the prices started from $13.95 up to $31.95. Everything comes with 2 sides or \"fixins\" and corn bread. I chose \"The Three Kings\" because I wanted to try their ribs, it has Briskett and I like chicken. My \"fixins\" were Mac n Cheese and mashed sweet potatoes.\n\nWhat was presented to me by our ever so friendly waitress was a mound of food that looked delicious. Before I continue, I was asked if I like white or dark chicken meat. I'm a thigh and wing fan but was told I could only have thigh/leg and breast/wing; Now why is that?\n\nThe ribs were big, moist, the meat came right off the bone. There are three sauces to choose from which were mild, medium, and spicy/hot all with a vinegar base and added a nice touch to the Briskett. \nThe Briskett was more of a pulled pork and not the nice slices with a crispy topping I'm used to at E and J's. It tasted great but I just wouldn't call it Briskett.  The Chicken was moist, had a nice grilled taste and I had that wrapped up in a to go box for lunch today. \nThe sides were tasty, served hot. The Mac and Cheese was my favorite side, it's one of those dishes that takes me back to my childhood and this did just that, I should have ordered a double side of this. The sweet mashed sweet potatoes were good too, can't complain about them but wished I would have ordered mashed potatoe since I'm a fan. The cornbread was unique, not sure what they do to it but it was brown instead of yellow  but had a \"Stick to your ribs\" quality that I liked and was moist and not crumbly.

Baby Blues BBQ has been on my radar for quite some time.  I always pass their establishment on my way into the Mission, but I'd never actually stopped in.  A peek at the Carnaval SF website that morning reminded me Baby Blues BBQ was a must for the weekend.  The restaurant is noted as a sponsor for the event, and having worked in the events business for the past two decades I know how important sponsors are to local events.\n\nI stopped in for linner.  That's the pre-4:00 PM pocket between lunch and dinner.  I had perused the menu adhered to the window before I walked in.  The space inside is certainly a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  Lots of communal tables and individual tables with a mish mash of different types of chairs, I'd say the interior is pretty cool.\n\nGreeted by a gentleman who asked me to take any seat I did so at a nice little table hidden from the sun's glare outside.  I was handed the menu which I handed right back.  I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs which includes cornbread and two sides dubbed \"fixins\" here.  The two sides I ordered were mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  I ordered a Coke to wash it all down with.\n\nSurprisingly, the wait was pretty short.  From experience I've come to expect longer waits at BBQ places but that wasn't the case here.  They screwed up my order.  Either that or they read my mind.  While perusing the menu outside and going down the list of sides I stopped and wondered what chicken smoked rice was but decided against trying new things.  Guess what they brought me instead of the mashed potatoes?  Yup, it was the chicken smoked rice!  The sides are huge here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GGdphTw9TXYGu1HPtNT3BA?select=6RgyPvOpB08JwfTYNR2G1A) as they are served in bowls equivalent to my rice bowls at home.  With the two big bowls of sides I was prepared to be stuffed.\n\nThe rice was very good.  There was no smoky flavor though, but the seasoning was quite good.  It was kind of like a slightly dirty rice.  I liked the cole slaw a lot because it was creamy without being overly so.  The seasoning in that was very good also.  The huge slab of cornbread was a bit hard and crusty along the edges but the heart of the bread was nice and moist with lots of corn kernels mixed into the batter.\n\nI loved the baby back ribs.  Served dry with a blackened, smoky rub the ribs were not fall off the bone but they were super meaty, moist and tender nonetheless.  There are four sauces to choose from and a bottle of vinegar with pickled hot peppers.  The molasses based sauce was just wrong for my taste and the XXX sauce had just one X too many for me as it quickly rose up my nostril and continued on instantly forming a teardrop at the edge of my eye.

And I love how there are signs up still advertising \"DRUGS.\" \n\nBaby Blues BBQ made such a fantastic first impression on us that we came back twice in one week. I couldn't get my mind off of them. Here are my notes:\n\nVisit #1: Late lunch: we walk into an enormous space with Bob Marley on the speakers & are greeted by our waitress telling us to take a seat anywhere we'd like (the only other patrons were at the bar, enjoying their liquid lunch, i assume.) We pass up the communal table & the bar & opt for a seat on the bench along the wall. \n\nThe lunch specials, served from 12-4pm, are well priced at under $13 for sandwiches & meats combos, but I noticed their \"platters\" are priced higher than other BBQ joints in the city. We shared \"The Blue Devil:\" 4 meats & 3 \"fixins\" for $31.95. (Roadside BBQ on Geary charges $23 & i think Memphis Minnies does 3 meats/2 sides for $20.) \n\nTheir BBQ shrimp, which I've never had at a BBQ joint, gets 5 stars. They were large, a little spicy from the sauce & grilled to perfection. Honestly, they were the reason we came back. I also really enjoyed their sides; blues on the cob (sprinkled w/ cheese) & mac & cheese were both excellent.\n\nI could take or leave: their brisket (pulled & shredded--never seen brisket done this way before) & their beef ribs, which were meaty but also fatty. (Not all beef ribs are fatty--case in point: the ones from Roadside BBQ.) Their corn bread is moist & full of corn, but there is a spice in it (which I can't identify) that gives it a pungent taste I don't particularly care for. \n\nDid not try: pulled pork & chicken smoked rice. According to the bf, both were so-so.\n\nTheir BBQ sauces are watery, but still quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Ginger Tabasco the most. \n_________________________________\n\nVisit #2: Late dinner, right before they were set to close. We walk in & are seated near the ukuleles. The place looks different when dim; definitely very festive w/ Christmas lights & dancehall playing loudly. I'm seeing details & decorations I missed the first time around & dig the eclectic mishmash of items. \n\nWe order \"Big Blue\" which is 3 meats w/ 2 fixins for $25.95. They ran out of BBQ chicken (which the bf was excited to try) so in addition to baby back ribs, we doubled up on our shrimp order. The shrimp were as succulent as we remembered (altho I think we were a few shrimp shy of a double portion...) Their baby back ribs were wonderful; it had a nice crust & wasn't too smoky. Again, the sides (mashed potatoes w/ some skin left in it & baked beans) were a hit. I liked their banana pudding, but the bf commented it just tasted like banana flavored whipped cream (which means I don't have to share.)\n\nWe've been here once when it was pretty empty & once when it was packed & our servers have always been great; they're quick & get our orders right. Love the location, love the atmosphere & most importantly, love (most of the) food.

There were a total of 6 people seated at tables eating/ordering, and about 4 people at the bar.  It appeared that there was only one waitress for the whole place.\n\nThe bartender finally looks up and asks us how many?  3.  Then he basically tells us to sit wherever.  Thanks, we couldn't have figured that out a couple minutes ago.  We sit down, and a waitress brings us the menus.  The bartender comes to take our orders.

We were never told \"goodbye, and here's my replacement\" by the original waitress, no one came to check and see how everything was, no one offered refills or more drinks.  We were clearly finished eating when the new waitress took my boyfriends beer glass away, but she never offered to clear our plates, or ask if we wanted to take anything home.  It took about 20 minutes to get our bill, and that was from the bartender, and they STILL never cleaned our table.  I was livid, I have never received such horrible service, certainly not in a restaurant that was as slow as it was then!\n\nOh, and the grand total for our \"authentic\" BBQ?  $76.00, PLUS TIP.

I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The meats - pulled pork, chicken, beef brisket, and ribs - were excellent, and the sides - mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach - were all good, in that order of personal preference.

Baby Blues doesn't really have Carolina Q, and you can tell they are still getting up on their feet over there, but this is a quick summary of my first impressions: \n\nFood = 3 stars. The pulled pork was super tender and juicy and a generous portion, but no real seasoning that I could taste, just straight up pork. There was a good sauce on the table, but I'm still in search of the vinegar-based sauce; I think it would be a great addition to this dish. The slaw was just right, not too mayo-y. They were out of mashed sweet potato, so i tried the mac and cheese- no slouch! Frankly, I don't expect gourmet mac and cheese from a BBQ joint (go to Blue Plate for that), this was just fine. The cornbread needs work - I recommend go simple and traditional, stick to salty and light (this slice was neither). My beau's side of mashed potatoes was quite good, and the okra was fabulous. I mean it - really, really good okra. Finished with banana pudding - really mostly whipped creamy, very few bananas. I'd beef up the banana next time around. and the nilla wafers. \n\nAtmosphere = 3 stars. Good music, good lighting. I like the open kitchen/grill area and the large wooden tables (are any family-style seating?) I think Baby Blues could probably go even more simple with the presentation - I don't need a candle on the table of my BBQ joint, and it's not that dark in there anyway. I do, however, need room on the small tables for all that food! \n\nService = 4 stars. Baby Blues is still trying to figure out how to balance in-house orders with large delivery and take out orders, so we experienced a long (long) delay getting our food, similar to what some others have written about. But you know what? They recognized the problem, acknowledged it honestly, brought us our sides ahead of time upon request, and also gave us complimentary drinks and a dessert to thank us for our patience.

I'm sorry but I was sorely disappointed. I had read reviews by my fellow Yelpers and my gut told me to go there with caution. \n\nMy coworkers and I each ordered a glass of wine as a treat after a long arduous week at work. One coworker got an extra treat when a fly landed in her wine. We had to flag down the waiter since he was too busy playing a board game at the bar to notice us. At least he gave her a full replacement glass of wine. I ordered the \"Three Kings\" platter hoping a sampling of 3 types of meat - the Memphis ribs, beef brisket, and chicken - would show me how good their BBQ was and have enough to bring home to my husband. Fortunately the chicken was juicy and tasty and the beef brisket was moist but needed sauce for some flavor. My biggest disappointment was the Memphis ribs. I know Memphis BBQ uses a dry rub, but that doesn't mean the BBQ is dry too! Not only was there little to no meat on my rib bones but the meat was as dry as a bone. It was completely inedible. One of my sides, the creamed spinach, was bland. The saving grace of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were tasty. \n\nWe also ordered banana pudding to round out the meal. Another big disappointment. I don't know why they called it \"pudding\" since it was merely a bowl of very thick and somewhat tasteless whipped cream with a few slices of banana.

I waited a few weeks after opening to try this neighborhood restaurant for a couple reasons.  One is I like to give a new place some time to work out the opening bugs.  The other is signage - or lack thereof.  The restaurant has no exterior signage with the name of the place so I had no idea how to call in a take out order.  My friend Kurt and his boyfriends wound up going this past Tuesday and he brought me a menu yesterday so I knew I would call in an order on my way home.\n\nMy concern continued when I called in a pretty simple order (one whole chicken and three sides) and was told it would be 20 minutes.  OK - I can handle that even though I'd be passing by on my way from 24th St BART to home in about 10 minutes.  So I get there and no one greets me.  There is no signage regarding take out.  I get the attention of the bartender and say I'm early for a take out order and she goes to check but doesn't come back and tell me anything.  The place is LOUD.  Hard surfaces everywhere, a cheap , tinny sound system blaring music and the visual assault of a large screen tuned to ESPN.  I continue to stand by the bar but am not offered a drink - which I would have gladly bought to dull the noise and ease the wait.  \n\nI want to get someone's attention to ask if they can run my card so that when my order is up I can go but the staff is pretty much running in circles.  This became more frustrating as eventually I could see what I was certain was my order bagged and ready.  The person behind the bar approaches me with my check (and not a bag) and I give her my card and she takes it while running to answer the phone.  She stays on the phone a few minutes and returns with my card.  I sign and she runs for the phone again.  I'm waiting and she eventually gets another waiter near her to bring me the bag.  I ask if there is any sauce in it (it's a BBQ joint!) and she says no and goes to get some of each of the two available.  I'm pleasant as I say thanks - now 35 minutes after placing my order - 25 of them observing the chaos under unpleasant conditions.\n\nAnyway - they're new, I'm hopeful and hungry and only a couple blocks from home.  I get home and open the bag.  The sides are already a disappointment in size: three 1/2 pint containers: mashed potatoes (delicious) baked beans (OK but not baked enough - too saucy) and collard greens (pretty good but oddly saucy too).  I plate a little of each then open the chicken package.  Smells good and looks like a lot but wait something's wrong.  I mentioned I ordered a whole chicken and expected to see just that - perhaps cut in 1/4s but would have been fine whole.  Instead there are four 1/4s.  Now none of my friends would confuse me for a breast man and that goes for my taste in chicken too.  But the four 1/4s I was looking at were all breast/wing 1/4s.  Four of 'em.  I was looking forward to a leg/thigh which, to me, tastes better and also stays moister through a long smoking and would have left the expected two breasts for my roommate later or myself if super tasty.  \n\nSo, already disappointed on a lot of levels I cut up a breast/wing and no way this spent a long time in a smoker.  Roadside, for example, smokes their chickens 4 hours (and their pulled pork and brisket for 17!)  so that it's falling off the bone but this was actually difficult to separate the wing.  Don't get me wrong -  I am not saying it was undercooked - it was fully cooked - but not slow smoked by a long shot.\n\nLast straw - I spent $30 on one chicken and three sides an no corn muffins?  \"They come with all the meals and this is the same as two meals and there should have been at least a couple in there.  I'm pretty sure I didn't see them in the sides section or I would have even bought them.\n\nLike I said, I *really* want to like this place and for it to succeed.  It's joined a neighborhood of very good restaurants who all do a large amount of take out so they will need to streamline that operation: signage, promptness, something to do while waiting - like selling me a drink - would all be good starters.\n\nI'd like to see them publish their smoke times, temperatures and woods used - BBQ eaters care about these things.  And BBQ eaters who do their own smoking (like me in a Kamado) *really *care.  \n\nI'll try more of their sides too - but think the portions should be full pints when a la carte at that price: they are as GFC up the street and at Petes @ 20th.  \n\nI'm very happy to see catfish and shrimp on the menu which don't require long smoking for flavor/tenderness but am leery of the ribs and brisket if they are anything like the chicken.  And finally, when someone orders a whole chicken - give them one - preferably from one bird but at list try and replicate the parts from one.  \n\nI promise to be back soon - hope it gets better.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-02-05"}, {"excerpts": ["sweet potatoe mashed potatoes hella good!!!

Paul cleaned it up and made a little joke about it, and as an incredibly sweet gesture, he brought over a bottle of his best Syrah to replace it as a gift.  I was floored!  He and his staff really went out of the way to make us happy, and his friendliness and his kitchen's amazing cooking helped to make my birthday very special.  \n\nIt's hard to satisfy a group of 20 hungry people, and Baby Blues definitely delivered!

It's a great place for groups, and they serve a variety of beers and wines at reasonable prices. When I walked in, a very hipster bartender greeted me, and she was super friendly and prompt!\n\nAfter reading numerous reviews, it seemed that the shrimp and salmon were amazing, but Yelpers didn't agree on most of the meats and sides. I decided to try a sampling of different items to resolve this debate myself. I found that the shrimp was truly delicious and that the meat and sides were pretty average.\n\n* BABY BLUES BAYOU, Grilled BBQ Shrimp ($22.95) - 4 STARS: Very delicious and fresh, but I definitely wouldn't qualify it as a \"Tiger Prawn,\" which is what they advertise under sides. It's a small-medium sized prawn, and overall pretty expensive considering it comes with just 7 shrimp. I would have preferred to order a la carte (@ $2.50 each), since I wasn't a big fan of the sides (2 complimentary sides and corn bread). I'd suggest if you just want shrimp to buy a la carte since I wasn't a huge fan of the sides.\n\n* BONES AND NO BONES, 1/2 Baby Back Ribs and 1/2 lb Pulled Pork or Beef Brisket ($25.95) - 2.5 STARS: I was not impressed by the ribs (not tender), the pulled pork (tasted pretty standard), or the brisket (which was plasticy and just not good). The saving grace was there large variety of BBQ sauces which spiced things up.\n\nSides:\n* Cole Slaw: Standard\n* Sauteed Okra: Surprisingly tasty and comes with stewed tomatoes mixed in\n* Collard Greens: Standard but good\n* Corn Bread: Sweet and chunky, not my cup of tea.\n* Mac n Cheese: Just.... bad. I'm sad to report this had too much flour, seemed to be stewed too long, and lacked the necessary seasoning and cheese. I prefer easy mac.\n\nBaby Blues is a cool spot, and I would definitely return with a large group because it has the perfect ambiance for you and friends to catch up over BBQ and beers. I wasn't particularly impressed by the food, but I wouldn't mind coming back and sticking with the seafood even though it is overpriced.

I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the brisket (YUM), sauteed okra (double YUM), and collard greens (triple YUM).

You have to take the bitchy people who are not coherent and that can't spell with a grain of salt in reading these reviews. They are unfair and clearly not getting laid.\n\nI moved here recently from Portland, Oregon - which media has been in love with the past few years as THE new culinary city to pay attention to. I feel this is a fair assessment and I feel like I've been spoiled there - so hopefully that counts for something. I understand that one off experiences could have been bad - there is always that chance. However, tonight my boyfriend (who has been here a couple of times and has been suggesting it repeatedly) finally got me to check it out. I am originally from Walla Walla in Washington State, where BBQ is king and my dad is the master of hunting, curing and preparing meats. (I have really awesome deer meat jerky in my fridge right now that he made - yes, really.) What I loved about it:\n\n1. I was able to order a nice mix of veggie-oriented foods (great salad with awesome onion vinaigrette, corn on the cob with some yummy cheesy seasoning, and mac-n-cheese) so I didn't feel like typical BBQ places where you eat a ton of meat and then moan because it takes forever to digest it all.\n\n2. The meat: I had BBQ shrimp and it was awesome - not overcooked, but great with the variety of sauces. My boyfriend had catfish and it was also very tasty.\n\n3. If you like decent wine and totally have gotten used to the crap selection in most places that are not super high end in this city - you will be very pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend is European and I'm a wine snob and they have Sencerre on the menu....at a BBQ place! We found out the owner's partner is French and picked the wines - nice work!\n\n4. For dessert we ate apple pie that had just come out of the oven and it was amazing. Enough said.\n\n5. The service was great. I'm straight, but the young women were super cute and sweet and total eye candy.

They have a really good smoked flavor and I like how they have a char to them. That char gives it a real authentic taste that I like.

We were never told \"goodbye, and here's my replacement\" by the original waitress, no one came to check and see how everything was, no one offered refills or more drinks.  We were clearly finished eating when the new waitress took my boyfriends beer glass away, but she never offered to clear our plates, or ask if we wanted to take anything home.

I'd suggest making reservations, when we left all the tables were full. I think if you didn't have reservations, they sat you at the communal table.\nI'm a planner in all aspects of life. So much so, that I looked at the menu and decided on my dish. For starters, we had the Suicide King with pork,  I got the Bones, No Bones, hubby got the Memphis Queen and of course the kids got the chicken strips and mac and cheese.\n\nStarter: The cornbread was tasty and crubmbly. It was on the sweeter side, which was ok.  The pork and coleslaw  was fine, nothing exciting about it.\nHowever, the BBQ sauces that they had on the table are to DIE FOR!!! They should sell them!!!  A lot better than what you can get from the grocery store. I was dousing all my meat in it. My combination was the sweet sauce along with their spicy one. \n\nMain dishes: I was a little disappointed, our meat was room temperature. I'm sure it would have been better if it was hot. Also, I was looking forward to sliced beef brisket and not shredded beef brisket. Insert sad face here!\n\nThe mac and cheese tasted strange.... I think it was the cheese they used??. nMy kids didn't even finish theirs! And they can eat mac and cheese for days! Even the stuff out of the box!\n\nService:  Spotty throughout the night.

It was just lots of melted cheese so it was really thick (and awesome). The coleslaw had a really strange taste that I couldn't put my finger on. My bf thinks it was mustard seed. It was good though. It also came with a huge slab of corn bread which I thought was just okay. I really only like super sweet corn cakes but my bf liked it. \n\nI can't say anything about the meat. I think my bf said it was kind of over cooked or something. He didn't finish all his chicken. The food is a little pricey but the 1/4 chicken is only 4.95 for some reason which is super cheap and the size was huge! You could definitely make a meal out of just that. \n\nWe didn't eat any dessert because we were stuffed and had to go to dinner later that night for my friends birthday at Esperpento (horrible btw, don't go!). \n\nThe decor was amazing! I loved it. Great job on mixing western and modern. I've never seen anything like it before. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated and clean. \n\nService was nice.

We didn't notice till after that they have a bunch of lunch specials that all the other patrons who finally came in later ordered. Its on the back of their menu and they are pretty reasonably priced. I think they were around $11.95. \n\nI asked for a take out menu but the owner (?) said they didn't have any because they're redoing  their menu and are reprinting menus. Eek!

We were clearly finished eating when the new waitress took my boyfriends beer glass away, but she never offered to clear our plates, or ask if we wanted to take anything home.  It took about 20 minutes to get our bill, and that was from the bartender, and they STILL never cleaned our table.  I was livid, I have never received such horrible service, certainly not in a restaurant that was as slow as it was then!\n\nOh, and the grand total for our \"authentic\" BBQ?  $76.00, PLUS TIP.

"], "author": "Yvette K.", "review": "Not the best and not the worst BBQ. I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["the sandwich was on a small round bun,, had a thin piece of fish, and a skimpy lump of coleslaw on top.

The Memphis style pork long rib came seasoned well, not overdone & not exactly falling-off-the-bone tender, but just tender enough. The big surprise came in the form of their collard greens. Had plenty kick to it and could possibly be a meal on its own or with a side of their perfectly made cornbread. The condiments include a zesty, tangy BBQ sauce, a less piquant and subtly sweeter version & a ketchup bottle of nearly weapons-grade tabasco sauce.

Fail.\n\nThe okra had giant, fibrous stalks in it that were basically inedible. Every third or forth bite, I had to reach into my mouth and pull out a 3\" long mess of plant stalk that simply refused to break down in my chewing.\n\nLast (and possible least) is the cornbread.

"], "author": "Damien W.", "review": "Let me preface my thoughts by saying that I'm a real barbecue aficionado.  I have a mild obsession with good barbecue; in fact, I ordered the June 2008 issue of Texas Monthly (which ranks the best barbecue joints in Texas) and am going on a barbecue journey through rural Texas next month.  I realize Baby Blues bills itself as North Carolina barbecue, but I'm familiar enough with both styles to be able to write intelligently.\n\nThe problem with barbecue in San Francisco is that no restaurants are serious enough about the meat to use a pit smoker rather than one of those generic commercial smokers.  Notice that every well-regarded barbecue joint in the South pit smokes the barbecue.  Being a NC/TX barbecue snob when eating in CA isn't about putting on airs--there are real, tangible, substantive differences in the quality of the meat and the preparation.  Seeing the commercial smoker when I walked into Baby Blues was an immediate point against.\n\nNow to the food.  Baby Blues has its strengths and weaknesses.  I compare it most directly to Memphis Minnie's, which I believe to be the only decent barbecue restaurant in the city (Bo's in Lafayette is good but quite a drive).  I don't think Baby Blues compares favorably to Minnie's.  The brisket (braised--most serious barbecue restaurants serve it sliced) is absolutely drenched in sauce.  Good brisket doesn't need to be served in a soup of barbecue sauce.  Makes it impossible to taste the flavor of the meat, which is the entire brisket experience.  Minnie's brisket, while sometimes a little too dry (but generally excellent), earns a huge win when compared to Baby Blues.  \n\nMinnie's sausage also wins.  This may be my personal preference only--I like Czech sausage, not the links that Baby Blues serves.  \n\nBaby Blues may have a slight advantage on the ribs front.  The ribs (I tried both the Memphis style and the baby backs) are pretty good--juicy, though in smaller sizes and portions than Minnie's.  \n\nThe sides at Baby Blues are good.  Good cornbread and good creamed spinach.  The mac n cheese is identical to Minnie's, which makes me think they just use the same distributor.  \n\nThe service was also good.  This is sometimes a complaint of mine at Minnie's--they can be rude and dismissive, especially when busy.  At Baby Blues, the waiter and his young son (I think it was his son) were both very nice and asked what dishes I liked and didn't like--good form for a new business.\n\nIn the end, because quality of meat and preparation trump all other factors, Memphis Minnie's retains its spot on top.  Baby Blues isn't that far behind, though--and if you like ribs, I recommend it.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-01-17"}, {"excerpts": ["The meats - pulled pork, chicken, beef brisket, and ribs - were excellent, and the sides - mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach - were all good, in that order of personal preference.

The chicken was dry and did not taste good at all in fact all I could taste was charred over-cooked meat. I even got dark meat...dry dark meat just ain't right...in fact it is down right NASTY. The Catfish had a gassy after taste no doubt from the gas grill being used. The ribs were ok nothing to write home about  but I can do better ribs in my oven and the shrimp was decent....although it was a little over cooked but I can forgive that. I asked the server why it took such a long time to get our food to the table and he said...\"they just opened and they are still trying to figure things out\" We also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out... our server did say \"at least we did not run out of ribs this time\" We ended up ordering cold pecan pie which was not bad and cold peach betty/cobbler... Cobbler should be warm with vanilla ice cream...I think they offer these two dishes cold so that they can be made ahead and get to your table before the night turns into day!! The peach betty was ok but they used canned peaches which for me is unforgiveable.....\n\nHaving eaten BBQ in North Carolina....Kansas City and Georgia this ain't cutting it for me!! The meat lacked so much in so many ways.... I was not impressed with the wait time...the food or for that matter the decor. If the food was good I could get over having to wait for it...with so many yummy dining options in the mission I would for sure pass this one up. If their meats are slow cooked for 18 hours then the flavor and taste should be tasted all the way to the bones...there was little to no flavor in anything that I ate last night. I really wanted to like this place because I love me some BBQ but once again San Francisco has proved itself to be a foodie paradise in many ways but not when it comes to BBQ.

It's a small-medium sized prawn, and overall pretty expensive considering it comes with just 7 shrimp.

I'm sad to report this had too much flour, seemed to be stewed too long, and lacked the necessary seasoning and cheese. I prefer easy mac.\n\nBaby Blues is a cool spot, and I would definitely return with a large group because it has the perfect ambiance for you and friends to catch up over BBQ and beers.

I'm a chicken breast connoisseur, and my chicken breast was completely dried out. Boston Market cooks moister, more flavorful chicken. Portion-wise, it was a ginormous chicken breast, but I had to soak it in sauce to give it any flavor. My boyfriends ribs were also problematic.

And I love how there are signs up still advertising \"DRUGS.\" \n\nBaby Blues BBQ made such a fantastic first impression on us that we came back twice in one week. I couldn't get my mind off of them. Here are my notes:\n\nVisit #1: Late lunch: we walk into an enormous space with Bob Marley on the speakers & are greeted by our waitress telling us to take a seat anywhere we'd like (the only other patrons were at the bar, enjoying their liquid lunch, i assume.) We pass up the communal table & the bar & opt for a seat on the bench along the wall. \n\nThe lunch specials, served from 12-4pm, are well priced at under $13 for sandwiches & meats combos, but I noticed their \"platters\" are priced higher than other BBQ joints in the city. We shared \"The Blue Devil:\" 4 meats & 3 \"fixins\" for $31.95. (Roadside BBQ on Geary charges $23 & i think Memphis Minnies does 3 meats/2 sides for $20.) \n\nTheir BBQ shrimp, which I've never had at a BBQ joint, gets 5 stars. They were large, a little spicy from the sauce & grilled to perfection. Honestly, they were the reason we came back. I also really enjoyed their sides; blues on the cob (sprinkled w/ cheese) & mac & cheese were both excellent.\n\nI could take or leave: their brisket (pulled & shredded--never seen brisket done this way before) & their beef ribs, which were meaty but also fatty. (Not all beef ribs are fatty--case in point: the ones from Roadside BBQ.) Their corn bread is moist & full of corn, but there is a spice in it (which I can't identify) that gives it a pungent taste I don't particularly care for. \n\nDid not try: pulled pork & chicken smoked rice. According to the bf, both were so-so.\n\nTheir BBQ sauces are watery, but still quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Ginger Tabasco the most. \n_________________________________\n\nVisit #2: Late dinner, right before they were set to close. We walk in & are seated near the ukuleles. The place looks different when dim; definitely very festive w/ Christmas lights & dancehall playing loudly. I'm seeing details & decorations I missed the first time around & dig the eclectic mishmash of items. \n\nWe order \"Big Blue\" which is 3 meats w/ 2 fixins for $25.95. They ran out of BBQ chicken (which the bf was excited to try) so in addition to baby back ribs, we doubled up on our shrimp order. The shrimp were as succulent as we remembered (altho I think we were a few shrimp shy of a double portion...) Their baby back ribs were wonderful; it had a nice crust & wasn't too smoky. Again, the sides (mashed potatoes w/ some skin left in it & baked beans) were a hit. I liked their banana pudding, but the bf commented it just tasted like banana flavored whipped cream (which means I don't have to share.)\n\nWe've been here once when it was pretty empty & once when it was packed & our servers have always been great; they're quick & get our orders right. Love the location, love the atmosphere & most importantly, love (most of the) food.

Okra was cooked the right way (non-slimy), a bit on the over-salted-side, but the roasted tomato helped offset that.

Our first visit it really popped with a nice crust on the top which was missing.\n\nPurist will not like the collard greens in a tomato sauce, but I loved it! Great flavor. Sweet Potato salad was excellent as well. I didn't reorder baked beans this time, however on the first visit I thought they didn't resemble anything like baked beans I had ever come across, which in and of its self is okay, however flavor was lacking in my opinion.\n\nDon't miss desserts!

Baby Blues doesn't really have Carolina Q, and you can tell they are still getting up on their feet over there, but this is a quick summary of my first impressions: \n\nFood = 3 stars. The pulled pork was super tender and juicy and a generous portion, but no real seasoning that I could taste, just straight up pork. There was a good sauce on the table, but I'm still in search of the vinegar-based sauce; I think it would be a great addition to this dish. The slaw was just right, not too mayo-y. They were out of mashed sweet potato, so i tried the mac and cheese- no slouch! Frankly, I don't expect gourmet mac and cheese from a BBQ joint (go to Blue Plate for that), this was just fine. The cornbread needs work - I recommend go simple and traditional, stick to salty and light (this slice was neither). My beau's side of mashed potatoes was quite good, and the okra was fabulous. I mean it - really, really good okra. Finished with banana pudding - really mostly whipped creamy, very few bananas. I'd beef up the banana next time around. and the nilla wafers. \n\nAtmosphere = 3 stars. Good music, good lighting. I like the open kitchen/grill area and the large wooden tables (are any family-style seating?) I think Baby Blues could probably go even more simple with the presentation - I don't need a candle on the table of my BBQ joint, and it's not that dark in there anyway. I do, however, need room on the small tables for all that food! \n\nService = 4 stars. Baby Blues is still trying to figure out how to balance in-house orders with large delivery and take out orders, so we experienced a long (long) delay getting our food, similar to what some others have written about. But you know what? They recognized the problem, acknowledged it honestly, brought us our sides ahead of time upon request, and also gave us complimentary drinks and a dessert to thank us for our patience. More than one waitress came to apologize and see that we had what we needed. Very cool. \n\nWe will definitely be back to check it out again in a few weeks after things have settled down and the service and kitchen get some more practice on their routine.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The Chocolate kahlua cake was also moist and yummy, but if you like creamy pudding you will love the banana pudding."], "author": "Kyle T.", "review": "Two Words - Yum Mee\n\nI had the Texas beef rib and it was a decent size piece of meat that didn't weigh me down.

I'm sorry but I was sorely disappointed. I had read reviews by my fellow Yelpers and my gut told me to go there with caution. \n\nMy coworkers and I each ordered a glass of wine as a treat after a long arduous week at work. One coworker got an extra treat when a fly landed in her wine. We had to flag down the waiter since he was too busy playing a board game at the bar to notice us. At least he gave her a full replacement glass of wine. I ordered the \"Three Kings\" platter hoping a sampling of 3 types of meat - the Memphis ribs, beef brisket, and chicken - would show me how good their BBQ was and have enough to bring home to my husband. Fortunately the chicken was juicy and tasty and the beef brisket was moist but needed sauce for some flavor. My biggest disappointment was the Memphis ribs. I know Memphis BBQ uses a dry rub, but that doesn't mean the BBQ is dry too! Not only was there little to no meat on my rib bones but the meat was as dry as a bone. It was completely inedible. One of my sides, the creamed spinach, was bland. The saving grace of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were tasty. \n\nWe also ordered banana pudding to round out the meal. Another big disappointment. I don't know why they called it \"pudding\" since it was merely a bowl of very thick and somewhat tasteless whipped cream with a few slices of banana. I tasted no pudding whatsoever. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the meal was how much I had to shell over for a mediocre/bad meal. I'm sorry but the meal wasn't worth the $44 I paid. I think next time I have a bad week at work and my coworkers need a reward I'll suggest we go to El Rio across the street for good drinks, free oysters and for a fraction of the cost!", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-02-20"}, {"excerpts": ["My fav however was the banana pudding.

I for some reason thought it was a one time thing and decided to give them a chance anyway based on the fact that much is forgiven if the food is bombtastic. We waited for over 45 mins for a table last night....every 20 mins it was another 20 mins..it was busy and I get that sometimes you have to wait for good food. The staff at this place is stellar hence the two stars...however that is their only saving grace!! Once we were seated our server was nice and informed us that they were out of both sweet tea and unsweetened tea.....while reviewing the menu he was also very helpful in answering our questions about what was good and what was not.\n\nMy husband and I shared a mixed meat plate I believe it was the Baby Blues Plate...we got SHredded Beef...Pork Ribs (Memphis) and Chicken....our friends ordered a mixed plate as well with Catfish...Ribs..Chicken...Shrimp...so needless to say we had all of the meats covered at our table....we also got the Okras...Creamed Spinach...Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens. It took them almost an hour to bring our order over to us...not once did they check in to say that it would be right up or to bring the sodas that we ordered to replace the very awful tasting \"blue kool aid\" (I mean who messes up Kool Aid but that is another story). It would have been helpful to at least have some cornbread to eat since we were starving!! It was also at this point that I realized our wait had been this long based on the fact that the kitchen took a looooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg time to get the food prepared and to the tables.\n\nThe food came just as we were about to eat our arms off...The meat was luke warm and over cooked. The chicken was dry and did not taste good at all in fact all I could taste was charred over-cooked meat. I even got dark meat...dry dark meat just ain't right...in fact it is down right NASTY. The Catfish had a gassy after taste no doubt from the gas grill being used. The ribs were ok nothing to write home about  but I can do better ribs in my oven and the shrimp was decent....although it was a little over cooked but I can forgive that. I asked the server why it took such a long time to get our food to the table and he said...\"they just opened and they are still trying to figure things out\" We also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out... our server did say \"at least we did not run out of ribs this time\" We ended up ordering cold pecan pie which was not bad and cold peach betty/cobbler... Cobbler should be warm with vanilla ice cream...I think they offer these two dishes cold so that they can be made ahead and get to your table before the night turns into day!! The peach betty was ok but they used canned peaches which for me is unforgiveable.....\n\nHaving eaten BBQ in North Carolina....Kansas City and Georgia this ain't cutting it for me!! The meat lacked so much in so many ways.... I was not impressed with the wait time...the food or for that matter the decor. If the food was good I could get over having to wait for it...with so many yummy dining options in the mission I would for sure pass this one up. If their meats are slow cooked for 18 hours then the flavor and taste should be tasted all the way to the bones...there was little to no flavor in anything that I ate last night. I really wanted to like this place because I love me some BBQ but once again San Francisco has proved itself to be a foodie paradise in many ways but not when it comes to BBQ.  I may visit their LA restaurant to see how it compares but something tells me it may not be any better.

Yes, what is more romantic that some finger licking BBQ?!!? We had the kids with us, so being that this place was kid friendly, was even better!\nI made reservations for 6:15 and once we drove around looking for parking (we got super lucky and found a spot just a few steps away) we were seated right away.  I'd suggest making reservations, when we left all the tables were full. I think if you didn't have reservations, they sat you at the communal table.\nI'm a planner in all aspects of life. So much so, that I looked at the menu and decided on my dish. For starters, we had the Suicide King with pork,  I got the Bones, No Bones, hubby got the Memphis Queen and of course the kids got the chicken strips and mac and cheese.\n\nStarter: The cornbread was tasty and crubmbly. It was on the sweeter side, which was ok.  The pork and coleslaw  was fine, nothing exciting about it.\nHowever, the BBQ sauces that they had on the table are to DIE FOR!!! They should sell them!!!  A lot better than what you can get from the grocery store. I was dousing all my meat in it. My combination was the sweet sauce along with their spicy one. \n\nMain dishes: I was a little disappointed, our meat was room temperature. I'm sure it would have been better if it was hot. Also, I was looking forward to sliced beef brisket and not shredded beef brisket. Insert sad face here!\n\nThe mac and cheese tasted strange.... I think it was the cheese they used??. nMy kids didn't even finish theirs! And they can eat mac and cheese for days! Even the stuff out of the box!\n\nService:  Spotty throughout the night. Our server was busy with sooo many tables, that she was only by our table once to check on us and we had to wait and try to flag her down to get refills on our drinks. \n\nI don't think I'd come back.

For 7pm on a weeknight it was pretty empty and as you come in you're unsure if you seat yourself or a hostess will greet you. Eventually an employee came up and said anywhere I'd like to sit would be fine. A few of the bar stools were taken but other than that it was pretty slow, with only a few tables of customers.\n\nI was handed a menu and after going over my options, I decided to go with the shrimp sandwich rather than slab of ribs to myself. The menu has starters, salads, fixins (side orders), small plates, platters, sandwiches, a la carte meat menu, and a kids menu. There's plenty of great sounding smoked meats including: brisket, pulled pork, hot links, burgers, and ribs, of course. The grilled shrimp po'boy runs for $11.95 and is topped with cole slaw and does not include any fixins.\n\nIt's here where Baby Blues began to detrioriate for me. I don't mind the fact that it took a minute to figure out the seating situation, but I do mind waiting over 15 minutes for a small sandwich and a sliced pickle. As I waited I saw the similar problem with others, not knowing if they should seat themselves or whether a waitress woulld seat them. The resteraunt began to pick up and eventually my shrimp po'boy came out and my waitress was very friendly and explained the sauces and recommended a tabasco-like sauce for my sandwich which was spot on. \n\nThe sandwich was served on ciabatta bread and was simply shrimp and cole slaw. It was a rather bland sandwich but the shrimp were grilled nicely and the recommended sauce gave it a necessary kick in flavor. Other than that I stuffed the pickle into my sandwich and those were the only componenets to the sandwich. I expected a bit more for $12 and I guess that's where the fixins come into play. Once done with my meal, business steadily picked up and it was getting busy around 8 o'clock. With only 2 or 3 waitresses on duty and one bus boy, I was left waiting for my check for a good 10 minutes and another 10 minutes or so to return my card. It began to be a big waste of time and I felt another appetite coming.

This sounded like a lot of food but I was sharing with my roommate and we thought it sounded right for two people.  We were wrong.  \n\nI received a call 10 minutes after placing the order and was told that they had run out of corn bread (my favorite item) and I needed to make another selection.  Not very apologetic but I thought \"this stuff happens\".  \n\nThe delivery arrived earlier then they stated but was missing the Texas Ribs.  I did receive 1 burnt chicken wing with some breast meat, 5 dry grilled shrimp and 1 Beef Rib.  (I thought when you put an \"s\" at the end of a word it meant \"MORE THAN ONE\").  The side dishes were all in tiny deli containers and hardly more than a few bites.\n\nI called the restaurant and it took them 20 minutes to find the original order.  They  determined that a mistake was made when they placed the order into the kitchen and offered to send the missing item(s) in 45 minutes.  Dinner was over.  They weren't apologetic or even concerned that they had ruined my dinner and the items that did arrive were overcooked and uneatable.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told \"he was working the grill and couldn't come to the phone\".  I think this restaurant should take a hard look at how they take To-Go orders and if they can't handle it then they shouldn't do it!

Like most SFBBQ they take a pan-American fusion approach, meaning they serve Texas style, Memphis style, etc., all with some tropical fruit in the sauce.  The place is pretty spotless, an old drug store without much signage and the only way you know there's food inside is seeing all the people eating.\n\nThe night I came the kitchen was backed up, food came out intermittently, and servers had lots of personality.  That's okay, I wasn't in a hurry.  Also, the music and video selection were pretty random, electronica / dance music if I recall.\n\nWell, most of the meat was well cooked and smoked, with sauce to add later.  The sauces were good but all the meat I tried (chicken, grilled shrimp, pork ribs) was delicious as it is, so the sauce was just an afterthought.  Collard greens were delicious, and their cornbread is a story by itself - molasses and other dark stuff, it's as dark as carrot cake.\n\nIt can be either very cheap or very expensive.  The key is, one $20-$25 plate is plenty for two people unless you're completely famished.  So dinner for two with one big plate, an extra side, a beer, tax and tip, can come in at $40.

I loved the chunks of meat in the fries and the melted cheese was so good. \n\nSecond best was the brisket but only because it was good to eat with the sauce. It wasn't as good alone, not as tender as I would've liked but ok nonetheless. The ribs were too burnt for me and definitely wasn't \"fall off the bone\" good. But not bad either. \n\nAnother notable thing was the fresh lemonade. It was super sweet but I liked it. They seem to only have a small batch made since the table next to us tried to order but was told they were sold out.\n\nThe guy serving us was really nice and I loved the little kiddie corner they had next to our table.

It's not a negative comment, but rather a true reflection of the harsh reality.  The building where Baby Blues is located used to be a Rexall Drugstore, and the old DRUGS sign is still there.  The much more modest neon \"BBQ\" sign almost pales in comparison.  Less than a half block away, the old gun store proudly is identified by the menacing GUNS sign.  The point I am trying to make is this: it's a perfect location for this kind of place.\n\nWhen you walk in, you feel as though you entered a large kitchen or a small barn.  Sure, the bar, the flat screen TVs and the contemporary art on the walls might remind you of a trendy restaurant, but . . .  The ratty checkered tablecloths, wobbly tables and mismatched chairs make you wonder whether you wandered into someone's garage by mistake.  Then you see a giant BBQ pit, and you don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nThe hostess and the waiters are all incredibly nice.  While the food does take a long time (I did wonder if they had forgotten our orders), they really try to take care of you.  They refilled my soda at least 3 times before our food came out, and I didn't even have to ask.  You don't expect great service in a place like this, but you do get it at Baby Blues.  I should have ordered the Kool-Aid ($2, unlimited refills) just because.  Can you think of a place that has Kool-Aid on the menu?  I can't.\n\nNow, for the food itself.  I had the pulled pork plate.  For $13.95, it comes with two sides and a piece of cornbread.  I was not impressed with the pulled pork itself, and neither was my friend.  We agreed that it tasted a bit \"watery,\" like pork from a can would.  I felt like it tasted more boiled than it did BBQ'd.  We also shared a 1/2 lb of brisket ($6.50), which did not look or feel like 1/2 lb.  The brisket was also shredded and looked very much like the pork, but tasted much better.  It was more solidly cooked and more BBQ'd.  \n\nThe sides were definitely the best part of the meal, which is not exactly a ringing endorsement for a BBQ place.  My friend actually ordered The Sidecar (4 sides + cornbread), and that may have been the way to go.  My mac 'n' cheese was gooey and delicious, with crunchy breadcrumb crust.   The mashed sweet potatoes were a bit runny, but delicious nonetheless.  The cornbread was a different story.  Baby Blues cornbread is different, and nobody likes different.  It was darker, harder and sweeter than what I would expect cornbread to be.  I love corn and I finished the whole piece, but it just wasn't that great.  \n\nThe bill for the three of us (3 dinners, extra side of brisket, 3 beers and a soda) was $70+tip.  Definitely not a cheap dinner, but not a bank breaker, either.  I'd probably come back here again, but I am not going to expect anything super authentic and out of this world.

No sweet butter or honey to go with it if that's your thing. \nWe tried all the sauces. The tangy tabasco was my favorite. The sauce that was supposed to be very hot, wasn't to my palate, and it tasted a little bland. Then there was a sauce that was a little sweeter, also a little bland. I mixed the tabasco and the hot sauce, and that was my favorite combo for the pork. \nWhen my brother comes to visit me from KC, I won't take him here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-11-19"}, {"excerpts": ["We tried the pulled pork plate and the baby back ribs......", "Both were great (big portions)....

The platters come with 2 sides/each so we shared mac n' cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, creamed spinach and beans....All of them were great!  The cornbread was ok (different from the fluffy mix most of us bake at home).   I'd definitely go back and try more options (they have lots)... Not cheap but seemed less $$$ than Big Nates.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-04-23"}], "sliced brisket plate": [], "smoked chicken plate": [], "blackened catfish plate": [], "memphis ribs plate": [], "baby back ribs plate": [], "bbq shrimp plate": [], "chopped brisket plate": []}
