I went around 12:30 p.m. on a weekday and the place was about 1/3 full.  The restaurant has a very casual vibe and the four of us were seated very quickly.  \n\nThe menu has pretty much most things you'd expect from a Japanese restaurant: simple sushi rolls, curry, sesame chicken, teriyaki items, udon, etc.  So it's a good place for those who like variety.  The food itself is pretty decent and very fairly priced.\n\nI ordered:\n-Tea (free): warm tea is a nice touch- we even had the pot refilled once.\n\n-Chicken curry udon ($6.49): a very good sized portion for the price.  My friend and I both ordered this (after hearing good things about it from another friend) and neither of us finished ours.  There is a fair portion of chicken and some nice fried onions tossed in as well.  The curry soup was very flavorful and a bit on the spicy side- but it was still pretty good.  The noodles taste like any other udon that I would buy from the supermarket and cook up at home, but that's good enough for me.\n\nOverall, the food is decent and the price is right.  The curry udon is probably the best thing I've had here.  Their sushi rolls aren't really that spectacular, but if you want something like a California roll, they'll have it.  I probably won't be eating here that often, but it's alright for take out.\n\nNotes:\n-They frequently have 15% off coupons (back of Safeway receipt).", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-02-02"}, {"excerpts": ["In addition to many of the rolls, I've also had the curry udon and regular udon.

The first maki roll item that jumped out at me was the \"Mexican Roll\". Looking further down the menu, I spotted the \"Pink Dragon Roll\". And I thought to myself...\"Waaaiiiit a minute...I've seen these items on a menu before. But I've never been IN this place.\"\n\nThen it occurred to me...KITARO out on Geary! (The waiter at the register quickly confirmed the sister status of these two restaurants.)\n\nSeveral years ago, when I didn't live all the way on the east side of the city (which, of course, I no longer do), I used to order takeout from Kitaro on a regular basis. And the Mexican and Pink Dragon Rolls were steady faves.\n\nI just ordered the Pink Dragon Roll this past weekend when I went to Kiki with my brother. But, this time, I was offered the choice of having the salmon cooked or uncooked on top, something that I had never considered when going to Kitaro (and I also asked that it made without that obscure mayo-type cream sauce that they run across the top with Christmas-colored sprinkles). I opted for the uncooked, and the end result was much like the \"Salmon Tsutsumi Roll\" at one of my favorite won't-break-the-bank sushi places in SF: I Luv Teriyaki & Sushi on Potrero Ave. But the Pink Dragon doesn't have the slivers of avocado between the salmon pieces, as the Salmon Tsutsumi does. Bummer.\n\nThe Mexican Roll (shrimp tempura within a roll, with chili powder) didn't have as much chili powder on it as I recall from past visits to Kitaro. But it was still pretty tasty.\n\nWe also ordered a couple of deep-fried rolls (the Godzilla and the Dynamite). Both were decent.\n\nI don't think I would order things like ikura nigiri for fear that it wouldn't be as fresh as, say, Ebisu up the street. But the maki rolls are satisfying, and you really can't beat the prices...under $7 for a Rainbow Roll???

The chicken karage is really good, freshly fried and super hot when it comes out! The sriacha mayo that comes with it is good and not too spicy, or you can ask for teriyaki sauce on the side.

I think it is because of the wild orange colored walls and the lack of japanese-esque decorations.

One needs a keen eye to watch for ways they can be deceptive in the things they do in order to keep a low cost.\n\nService:  Pretty bad.

I noticed that they give you a very large bowl filled with a lot of bland broth but hardly any udon noodles.  In fact, it tasted exactly like the instant udon noodles I buy at the Japanese market!  The tuna bowl had a lot of sushi rice, but had small, skinny  slices of tuna that looked more like shabu shabu meat than sashimi.  On top of that the tuna was not fresh.  It was very dry and chewy.  The sushi roll had very little tuna and rice, but was filled mainly with avocado.  1 star\n\nPrice:  It's cheap sure.  But, with what you're given, to be charged any more would be an outrage.

Or the tiny slices of tuna covering the rice) but I can see right through that.   2 stars\n\nLook if you were only given $10 then I suppose this is the only place you could go to.

I also really liked the tempura cream cheese sushi with sriracha...I don't know the name but made me think that it would fit right in with all the deep-fried twinkies and hot dogs I imagine at the county fair (which is a cultural experience I am still missing out on).  I was disappointed by the edamame...they were plain, small, a bit soggy, and just uninspiring.  I like them a little cold, crisp, and lightly salted...but I'm no expert, and definitely spoiled by the amazing edamame at Blowfish.\n\nLooking around the table, everyone seemed satisfied.

It's a great place if you're not willing to spend too much and are looking for VERY good sake bombs prices. \n\nThis place itself can be disorganized at times, especially when it gets hectic, which it really does during their happy hour (6-9PM?). It's been very rare that they take too long to bring something out and very rare that they'll forget something which is GREAT. But when I say it gets disorganized, I'm talking about seating people down. When it's happy hour or just dinner time, you have to get your name written down on a clipboard once you walk in. There's usually a sign that says, \"please wait to be seated\", so you can't miss it. STAY INSIDE the restaurant so you won't miss your name being called! \n\nThe outside and inside of Kiki's is quirky from start to finish. You can't miss this place and its Pee Wee Herman entrance.

I usually see this going on with Japanese restaurants that have below than average prices: people lose their shit and I'm not joking when I say that.
