Moments later our server came over, with the sent-back salad and menu in hand. He handed me the menu, and pointed to the salad section, \"remember when we talked about the apple gastrique...\" He was actually trying to show me that I was wrong, with the plate in hand!  Fortunately, the menu did not lie, and he quickly realized and fixed his mistake. The salad was great, but I have literally never had a server bring a over menu and the incorrect plate to try to prove that I am wrong. Unreal.\n\nWhile the rest of the group enjoyed some fine wines, I was pleased to discover a delicious IPA on tap from 101 North Brewing.
