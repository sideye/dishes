I don't care what anyone says SO in Soma is not Korean. So doing a little Yelp research we find this place and we decide to take the plunge.\n\nWhen we first walked in we're surprised that it's bigger than expected and actually feels like an actual Korean restaurant versus a Soju spot that serves food so +1 for that.\n\nSo the good points:\nThey have a really full menu. They even have some of the Korean/Chinese dishes like jah jahng mien (black bean sauce noodles) but they also offer the full range of bbq'd meats and stews. They also bring out \"banchan\" all the sides you get with a full Korean meal.\n\nThe negative points:\nTwo servers for like 20 tables. They're super nice but when it's busy there is no way to handle that many tables and bus them as well. If they just added one bus boy that would give them some relief to be able to at least check on you once. Basically I watched people get up and ask for things or you have to almost grab the waiter as he/she runs by to ask for something. BUT they're running around so much they forget so you have to repeat this a good 5 times.\n\nThe food: Most of the food was good. We order Kal Bi (short ribs) which was good. Pah Jun (Korean green onion and seafood pancake) and the Jah Jahng Mien. A lot of food yes. The main dishes were good. Not spectacular but good enough if we don't want a long commute to get some Korean. The banchan however, we noticed was not as fresh. Don't get me wrong, it's mostly pickled vegetables so there are various stages of sour and in a Korean home its all good when it gets sour but at a restaurant you're pretty much getting served some old banchan. Not all of it was like that but a couple of the dishes were.\n\n\nSo I'm torn about this place. I wanted it to be good really bad and the food was decent but they are just severely understaffed. We literally were never checked on. Anytime we needed anything we had to almost grab the server physically since they're so busy.

So today I gave Dong Baek a shot for lunch. I ordered the number 14 lunch special for $7.25 - Soon Tofu Chi Gae - soft bean cake casserole with hot bean paste, vegetable and beef. About 6 different panchan (and a bowl of rice of course) came with it. Nothing super interesting or different with the panchan except for a dish of tempura style green beans topped with a dark sweet sauce. \n\nThe dish is really a soup, not a casserole per se, and contained two mysterious oysters not indicated on the menu. No complaints from me, I liked them, but someone else may not appreciate their unannounced appearance. There was also precious little visible beef. Unlike My Tofu House, you aren't given the option of regulating the spice level here. I normally order mild at My Tofu House and add kimchee or hot sauce if I think it needs more kick. Here, it just comes out one way - red, hot and bubbling up at you with a dare. You might say I was dragged out of the shallow end of the Korean hot bean paste pool and drop kicked into the deep zone. I survived quite well. Although I did ask for (uhhhh...ok, NEEDED) an additional serving of the only two cooling panchan - the bean sprout salad and the daikon salad. I also missed the raw egg that I've been offered at other places serving soon dubu. So even though the soup was fairly tasty, it lacked the silky texture and slight mellowing effect mixing in the egg provides. \n\nDong Baek has an attractive and spacious traditional interior, with lots of warm carved wood and some private dining alcoves. The friendly single server did a good job of covering the tables all on her own. I can't say I was big fan of the sappy 80's soft rock radio playing in the background. Overall, I am glad I tried it, but no, no nearby substitute was found for My Tofu House. I guess I just need to light a fire under my lazy ass. Lol.

Even though the food is pretty pricy, what do you expect out of a restaurant approaching downtown SF? It's in a super sketchy and dirty Tenderloin district but don't let that discourage you. The portions are pretty hefty which means good leftovers for tomorrow! The bbq is probably some of the best I tried in the city so far. It's not the cook it yourself on the table type. They cook it for you in the kitchen which is fine because you can lay back and enjoy your food and avoid the super smoky room. Their other dishes are super bomb as well. The jajangmyun (black bean noodles), kampoogki (sweet wet fried chicken), dukgook (rice cake soup), boodaegeegae (spicy stew) are just among some favorites I get here. The banchan (side dishes) are the best! I was told that all of the banchan is made fresh every single day and it definitely shows. The kimchee is sooooo good! Best I ever had. The variety and amount they give you is amazing.\nThe service has always been good when I came but I could understand that it can get hectic when it's busy due to the number of people on staff. The owner is my favorite. She's always very nice and diligent when she has served me, but she is retiring which is super sad. Definitely going to miss her.

I don't care what anyone says SO in Soma is not Korean. So doing a little Yelp research we find this place and we decide to take the plunge.\n\nWhen we first walked in we're surprised that it's bigger than expected and actually feels like an actual Korean restaurant versus a Soju spot that serves food so +1 for that.\n\nSo the good points:\nThey have a really full menu. They even have some of the Korean/Chinese dishes like jah jahng mien (black bean sauce noodles) but they also offer the full range of bbq'd meats and stews. They also bring out \"banchan\" all the sides you get with a full Korean meal.\n\nThe negative points:\nTwo servers for like 20 tables. They're super nice but when it's busy there is no way to handle that many tables and bus them as well. If they just added one bus boy that would give them some relief to be able to at least check on you once. Basically I watched people get up and ask for things or you have to almost grab the waiter as he/she runs by to ask for something. BUT they're running around so much they forget so you have to repeat this a good 5 times.\n\nThe food: Most of the food was good. We order Kal Bi (short ribs) which was good. Pah Jun (Korean green onion and seafood pancake) and the Jah Jahng Mien. A lot of food yes. The main dishes were good. Not spectacular but good enough if we don't want a long commute to get some Korean. The banchan however, we noticed was not as fresh. Don't get me wrong, it's mostly pickled vegetables so there are various stages of sour and in a Korean home its all good when it gets sour but at a restaurant you're pretty much getting served some old banchan. Not all of it was like that but a couple of the dishes were.\n\n\nSo I'm torn about this place. I wanted it to be good really bad and the food was decent but they are just severely understaffed. We literally were never checked on. Anytime we needed anything we had to almost grab the server physically since they're so busy.

So doing a little Yelp research we find this place and we decide to take the plunge.\n\nWhen we first walked in we're surprised that it's bigger than expected and actually feels like an actual Korean restaurant versus a Soju spot that serves food so +1 for that.\n\nSo the good points:\nThey have a really full menu. They even have some of the Korean/Chinese dishes like jah jahng mien (black bean sauce noodles) but they also offer the full range of bbq'd meats and stews. They also bring out \"banchan\" all the sides you get with a full Korean meal.\n\nThe negative points:\nTwo servers for like 20 tables. They're super nice but when it's busy there is no way to handle that many tables and bus them as well. If they just added one bus boy that would give them some relief to be able to at least check on you once. Basically I watched people get up and ask for things or you have to almost grab the waiter as he/she runs by to ask for something. BUT they're running around so much they forget so you have to repeat this a good 5 times.\n\nThe food: Most of the food was good. We order Kal Bi (short ribs) which was good. Pah Jun (Korean green onion and seafood pancake) and the Jah Jahng Mien. A lot of food yes. The main dishes were good. Not spectacular but good enough if we don't want a long commute to get some Korean. The banchan however, we noticed was not as fresh. Don't get me wrong, it's mostly pickled vegetables so there are various stages of sour and in a Korean home its all good when it gets sour but at a restaurant you're pretty much getting served some old banchan. Not all of it was like that but a couple of the dishes were.\n\n\nSo I'm torn about this place. I wanted it to be good really bad and the food was decent but they are just severely understaffed. We literally were never checked on. Anytime we needed anything we had to almost grab the server physically since they're so busy.

So today I gave Dong Baek a shot for lunch. I ordered the number 14 lunch special for $7.25 - Soon Tofu Chi Gae - soft bean cake casserole with hot bean paste, vegetable and beef. About 6 different panchan (and a bowl of rice of course) came with it. Nothing super interesting or different with the panchan except for a dish of tempura style green beans topped with a dark sweet sauce. \n\nThe dish is really a soup, not a casserole per se, and contained two mysterious oysters not indicated on the menu. No complaints from me, I liked them, but someone else may not appreciate their unannounced appearance. There was also precious little visible beef. Unlike My Tofu House, you aren't given the option of regulating the spice level here. I normally order mild at My Tofu House and add kimchee or hot sauce if I think it needs more kick. Here, it just comes out one way - red, hot and bubbling up at you with a dare. You might say I was dragged out of the shallow end of the Korean hot bean paste pool and drop kicked into the deep zone. I survived quite well. Although I did ask for (uhhhh...ok, NEEDED) an additional serving of the only two cooling panchan - the bean sprout salad and the daikon salad.
