The menu listed the ingredients as: An oriental salad with south of the border flair; a crisp mix of greens, cabbages, jicama, snow peas, water chestnuts, tossed with sweet sesame dressing & topped with toasted almonds. It sounded delicious, so we ordered it and added chopped chicken. For $10, it was the perfect light meal for 2.

I've had a few occasions where the sliced cherry tomatoes are basically a bit frozen.

They also have a good variety of salads that are great for sharing for a light lunch option - if you've seen the displays, you know how big the salads are.\n\nThe Roadhouse Buck is one of my favorites - it's the only sandwich with thick cut tri trip (as opposed to thinly sliced) and sometimes when I'm just wanting MEAT, I'll get that - it comes topped with their crispy Roadhouse onions - a huge heaping mound, crumbled blue cheese on top and all in their sweet sandwich roll with their Red Ranch sauce slathered on the inside.

With a veritable United Nations of food available, you can't help but keep circling back and forth, looking at what everyone is eating and trying to decide what your meal should be.

At $6.95 for the sandwich alone, it is a little pricey.  The sandwich is kinda on the small side, though it does make a good mouthful.  I really liked the tri-tip and their savory mayonnaise, but the bacon was hard, rather than being crisp.  The tri-tip is cooked medium to medium-well, so its not as tender as it could be.  It is sliced thinly for the sandwiches, so it doesn't really get all up in your teeth.  I think that next time, I'm going for their regular tri-tip sandwich.\n\nFor an extra $2.22, you can make the meal a combo and get a drink and a side.

YES, YES, YES; YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!\n\nBuckhorn is one of the best options at the Westfield Food Court in terms of quality, pricing, and taste. I frequent Buckhorn about once a week and the food has ALWAYS been consistent. \n\nMy Go-Tos are the following:\n\n*Cabo Chop Salad w/ Tri-Tip (Romaine lettuce with avocado, black beans, corn, jicama, radishes, tomatoes and blue cheese dressed in a honey-lime dressing and placed in a crispy tortilla bowl): MY FAV!!!  The romaine is lightly dressed and then the remaining ingredients are piled up high. The ingredients are always fresh and vibrant in color. The tri-tip is tender and very well-seasoned. The blue cheese and honey-lime dressing work well in adding a savory, sweet, and tangy flavor which I love! Break off a piece of the tortilla bowl for that *CRUNCH*!\n\n*Roadhouse Salad w/ Tri-Tip (Mixed greens with crispy Roadhouse onions, string beans, tomatoes, bleu cheese crumbles & sweet Mariani walnuts tossed w/ honey basil vinaigrette): Although it's probably one of the most unhealthiest salads you can probably eat, it's also one of the most YUMMIEST! It has all the combination of flavors and textures you can ask for. The savory and salty from the Tri-Tip, the crisp from the Roadhouse onions (yummy shoe string onions), the tang from blue cheese and the sweet from the candied walnuts and honey vinaigrette. \n\nFor the salads, request that the tri-tip be sliced into cubes and not strips b/c it will make it a whole lot easier to eat! BTW, they don't skimp on the meat portions!\n\n*Roadhouse Buck (Tri-tip with Roadhouse Onions & Red Ranch sauce topped with bleu cheese crumbles). HOLY MOLY!!! This is one of the BEST tasting sandwiches EVER!!!! The 6 oz. tri-tip is sliced thick, cooked medium rare, tender and very well-seasoned. As you bite into it, you can taste all the juices still flowing out of it (no au jus needed). Ahhhhh!!! I love blue cheese esp with red meat....and in this case it adds a tangy, creaminess to the sandwich while the Roadhouse onions add that crisp and the red ranch a spicy kick. \n\nThey normally prepare the tri-tip medium rare, but you can always request it to be cooked further to a medium, medium-well, and well. \n\nPRICES: Very reasonable considering the massive portions. \n*Sandwiches are about $6.95. For an additional $2.45 you can get fries, mashers, Roadhouse Onions, or a salad and a drink. \n*Salads are about $7-9 and you can add chicken or tri-tip for $2.50 or salmon for $3.00.\n*Platters (meat and sides) are about $13.\n*Whole tri-tip to take home is $19.95!!!!\n\nSERVICE: Fast and friendly. They give you a pager while they're preparing your food, so take this time to find seating. During peak hours, it takes about 5-7 minutes to get your food.\n\nNothing can come between this girl and a good piece of red meat, so I will be back AGAIN, AGAIN, and AGAIN!!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-01-12"}, {"excerpts": ["Had the roadhouse salad and always enjoy the crispy fried onion strings on top.
