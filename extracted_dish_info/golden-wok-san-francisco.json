I feel awful for giving this place such a bad review. The service was inexperienced (the waitress clearly didn't know what she was doing but was trying hard). I also understand how hard and how much money it costs to have a family restaurant. I'm less sympathetic because it seems like they never even put in any effort. Why do you open a restaurant when you have random boxes scattered on the ground. Your plates are DUSTY. Hong Kong Delight, you fail.\n\n\nBottom line: I honestly feel lucky that I didn't eat a bug or get diarrhea.", "rating": 1, "date": "2012-03-09"}], "general chicken": [{"excerpts": ["Their general chicken and Mongolian beef are really good!
