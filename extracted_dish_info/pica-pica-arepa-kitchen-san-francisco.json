But only this year have I finally made an effort to stop by for dinner and boy was it worth it! I am disappointed that I didn't go sooner.\n\nOrder your food at the counter and grab a number. Three types of sauces are on the table and made in house. You can go for zesty, Herby, or spicy. The arepas are all delicious and the meats are juicy and flavorful - you can't go wrong. There are two different types of \"breads\". The original is made of white corn while the sweet is a yellow sweet corn. For the latter, I found the flavor subtle but my coworker found it too sweet for her - I think it's just personal preference. The sizes of the dishes are pretty substantial but definitely try out the fried plantains and yuca fries. The yuca fries are cut much thicker and have a denser texture than a typical french fry so you definitely can't eat as many. Make sure you eat them while hot though as that's when they taste best. \n\nSo... back to the nachos. If you think you've had taro chips and haven't liked them, you still need to try these. The chips are sliced super thin so that every bite is paired with a crisp base. Unlike tortilla chips, the taro chips have a very satisfying snap when you bite into one and are lightly salted. The chips are then loaded with savory meats, beans, fresh cheese and other toppings. It's a great dish to share if you're not too hungry but could also be a large meal for one if you really wanted.\n\nI'll need to come back a few more times but for now, it's certainly on my list of quick bites.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Yuca fries were pretty good, but the dipping sauce wasn't strong enough.

Not a lot of seating so it's not great for a large group of people. Expect to have to wait for a table if it's busy or plan to take your food to go. They're known for their arepas, or corn pockets, but they also have other things like rice plates, cachapas (sweet corn crepes) and salads.\n\nI've been back twice now and tried the cachapas and the arepas, both of which you can choose the meat filling (beef, pork, chicken, veggie). The CACHAPAS ($14.50) are served with a side salad and bigger in portion size. The AREPAS ($10) are served with a small cup of cole slaw (light and sweet/tangy rather than mayo based) and are honestly pretty tiny and feel more like a pricey snack rather than a meal. I've had both the white corn arepa and yellow corn, and definitely prefer the sweet yellow corn. The white corn was flavorless, but I did like the crisp, grilled exterior.\n\n* SPICY CHICKEN CATIRA - 4.5/5\n[mozzarella cheese, greens, tomato, pica'pun]\nI got my spicy chicken without cheese in the cachapa and thought it was delicious! The chicken was soft and moist. The flavor honestly just tasted like a less sweet, less thick version of BBQ sauce mixed with thousand island, but I enjoyed it. Not very spicy. I loved the sweet corn crepe! Soft and chewy with some slightly crispier parts. I only wish the sauce didn't make the crepe soggy at the bottom.\n\n* GRILLED CHICKEN - 3.5/5\n[black bean puree, tomato, queso fresco, guasacaca]\nI got the grilled chicken on the white corn arepa and thought it was lacking flavor overall. The grilled chicken was tender but simple in flavor, and probably would have paired better with the sweet corn. I'm not a fan of beans so I was a little hesitant about the black bean puree, but it was a great consistency and not overpowering. Probably the healthiest meat option.\n\n* CRISPY CHICKEN - 3/5\n[spicy pickled mojo, lettuce, jicama, tomato, aioli, guasacaca]\nNot particularly crispy, kind of dry and also lacking flavor. Between this and the grilled chicken, I thought the grilled chicken was better since it was at least tender.\n\n* YUCA FRIES ($5.25) - 3/5\nMeh. If you like thick cut potato fries, you'd probably like these. I prefer thin, crisp fries, so I wasn't as fond of these. Very thick cut, drier than normal fries and pretty bland unless you douse them in sauce. At least they weren't super greasy and had some crispness on the outside.\n\nOverall, solid food, but depends on the meat you get. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other meat options or even their nachos or salads (yes, those looked good too), but might pass on the arepas since they're rather small.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-14"}, {"excerpts": ["This is a small place with big heart, I went here for the first time many years ago to get my husband gluten free yuca fries after my swim at the YMCA pool not too far away.\n", "Even though I am not gluten free ", "I really enjoyed my healthy lunch there and the fries ", "Wow,Wow! \n", "Mouthwatering and light but crispy not the heavy yuca fries ", "like I have had back home in N.Y.

I was feeling a little hungry, but mostly trying to be proactive, as our plans involved heavy drinking to properly start Pride Weekend off with a bang.\n\nI ordered the Vegetariano arepa, which is described as having \"grilled tofu, avocado, sweet plantains, black beans, garlic aioli\".

There was a lot of flavor in that bad boy. I especially loved the contrast between the savory ingredients and the sweetness of the plantains. I would order extra plantains, if anything, because if you accidentally eat all of them before you finish the rest of your arepa, it loses a lot of the flavor. \n\nPlus plantains are fan-freaking-tastic, and you should always order extra, regardless. \n\nI've only had one other arepa in my life, and Pica Pica's version was much more flavorful. Then again, I smothered mine with the red chili sauce on the table, which also gave it a nice kick. I love how plentiful the avocado was, as well. \n\nI'm not a gluten-free gal by any means, but this is a terrific option for any of those who are, as nothing in their restaurant contains any gluten. Yes, that's right.

The plantains here tasted quite disgusting, almost like a deep fried, wet banana chips sopping with oil, barely even cooked--almost raw and too chewy, and definitely sweet.  Similarly, they smelled rancid, thus enhacing their unpalatable and disgusting taste.  The plantains over in Napa's Pica Pica has truly stirfried plantains, cooked in the Central American/Caribbean style whcih are wet, moist, soggy, and sweet due to the caramelization process from extensive stir-frying that brings out the sweetness.  \n\nBecause plantains are extensively used in Latin American cuisine, I had expected that the Mission's Pica Pica plantains would be cooked as I had like in the Pica Pica in Napa as well as what I've had in Latin American cuisine in general.  But no...and my friend was even more disappointed because she had expected that the plantains would be cooked the way we're used to... and truly the way to bring out the true flavor and sweetness of plantains.  As you could imagine, we could not finish the side of plantains because they just were not agreeable.\n\nThe one redeeming dish that Pica Pica does quite well is their yuca fries, which were as good as the Napa branch's.  Adding the garlic was an excellent touch, but costed an additional 50 cents.\n\nThe arepa and maizewich were so-so, and were a little too burnt.  They grill the arepa and maizewich (flat)breads, almost like a panini...but they overgrilled them that they were a bit on the charred side, imparting bitterness to the food.  It tasted like I was scarfing down carcinogenic charcoal down my throat.  Not very tasty and not pleasing to the palate either.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Pica Pica in the Mission as it did not compare with Napa's branch.  I would have thought that the Pica Pica in SF would be better due to the sheer fact that there are more Hispanics here, so the quality and freshness of the food would be better.  But my expectations were not met.  I don't think I'd come to this Pica Pica branch again due to my poor experiences here.  However, if I am in Napa, I'd definitely go to that Pica Pica since the quality and taste far surpasses the averageness I experienced here in the Mission.\n\nMy overall rating for the restaurant is a 2 *star*.

Finally had a chance and came by on a Sunday around noon for lunch with a group of friends. The line wasn't too long but the space is very cramped and we had a fight for about 15 minutes (after we got our food) to snag one of the few larger tables near the door. I definitely say this is an easier place to go to alone for a quick takeout meal. There's some bar seating but it runs parallel to the line and can get really cramped and uncomfortable. Because of how long the lines were there weren't any employees cleaning the tables which was unpleasant since the table before us left a mess but we didn't want to bother the employee who looked completely swamped at the register.\n\nOtherwise service was fine and the food came out fairly quickly and I appreciate how clean and straightforward their menu is. Between our group we ordered a variety of arepas with both white and yellow corn and a variety of meats. We also got a side of garlic Yuca fries and their nachos pica pica. \n\n1) Arepas: For my meal I got the blackened beef asado in a sweet yellow arepa. It came with a pleasantly light slaw on the side that pairs well with the meat. The arepa itself was really dry for the most part. I had a hard time chewing through it and it had very little flavor. The meat had juices flowing but texture-wise was stringy and slightly dry as well. The cheese and slaw were the main saviors. A bit pricy at over $10 (2.75/5)\n\n2) Garlic Yucca Fries: The garlic yucca fries were decent at first but once they weren't piping hot they revert to a stale-ish sawdusty texture. They had a thick crunch and a fluffy but dry starchy texture inside. I love the garlic on top and wish there was more. The fries became more of an aioli delivery vehicle for me after a while. (3.25/5)\n\n3) Pica Pica Nachos: The best part of the meal were definitely the nachos. Not exactly the most traditional dish but they're delicious and I don't care. I love taro chips and these were done very well. Large, evenly cooked, thin crisp chips stacked high with toppings. The only downfall of the dish was the pork which was flavorful but once again dry.

It was huge. Definitely something to share. I wish the pork had a little more flavor. \n**Pulled Pork Pernil Arepas with sliced tomatoes, avocado, pica pun, garlic aioli. - Wins best presentation. They use the same pork as the nachos. \n**Spicy Chicken Catira Arepas made with mozzarella cheese, greens, tomato, pica'pun. - Not at all spicy. But good flavor. \n**Crispy Chicken Arepas made with pickled mojo, lettuce, jicama, tomato, guasacaca. - Recommend with white corn instead of sweet. My favorite of all 4. The best flavor. \n**Blackened Beef Arepas made with sweet plantain, queso fresco. - It was way too sweet for me. \n\nWe also ordered the Sangria and **Fruit Frescas (coconut and lime). Sangria passion fruit. Does not taste like any others sangria. It was good because I can't taste the alcohol. The coconut drink was good, but you have to keep stirring it because the separation of the ingredients. More lime than coconut. \n\nRecommend to add the white and spicy sauce together.

Since I had been to the Napa Pica Pica, I told her that this place was going to be THE BOMB, but unfortunately, the Mission location does not compare with the original Pica Pica in Napa, CA.\n\nMy friend and I ordered:\n- a Pabellon arepa\n- a Pabellon Maizewich\n- garlic Yuca fries with aioli\n- Tajadas (stir fried plantains)\n\nThings tasted pretty similar between the Pica Pica in Napa and here, with the EXCEPTION of their plantains (in their tajadas and the plantains that they use to fill their arepas/Maizewiches/cachapas).  The plantains here tasted quite disgusting, almost like a deep fried, wet banana chips sopping with oil, barely even cooked--almost raw and too chewy, and definitely sweet.  Similarly, they smelled rancid, thus enhacing their unpalatable and disgusting taste.  The plantains over in Napa's Pica Pica has truly stirfried plantains, cooked in the Central American/Caribbean style whcih are wet, moist, soggy, and sweet due to the caramelization process from extensive stir-frying that brings out the sweetness.  \n\nBecause plantains are extensively used in Latin American cuisine, I had expected that the Mission's Pica Pica plantains would be cooked as I had like in the Pica Pica in Napa as well as what I've had in Latin American cuisine in general.  But no...and my friend was even more disappointed because she had expected that the plantains would be cooked the way we're used to... and truly the way to bring out the true flavor and sweetness of plantains.  As you could imagine, we could not finish the side of plantains because they just were not agreeable.\n\nThe one redeeming dish that Pica Pica does quite well is their yuca fries, which were as good as the Napa branch's.  Adding the garlic was an excellent touch, but costed an additional 50 cents.\n\nThe arepa and maizewich were so-so, and were a little too burnt.  They grill the arepa and maizewich (flat)breads, almost like a panini...but they overgrilled them that they were a bit on the charred side, imparting bitterness to the food.  It tasted like I was scarfing down carcinogenic charcoal down my throat.  Not very tasty and not pleasing to the palate either.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Pica Pica in the Mission as it did not compare with Napa's branch.  I would have thought that the Pica Pica in SF would be better due to the sheer fact that there are more Hispanics here, so the quality and freshness of the food would be better.  But my expectations were not met.  I don't think I'd come to this Pica Pica branch again due to my poor experiences here.  However, if I am in Napa, I'd definitely go to that Pica Pica since the quality and taste far surpasses the averageness I experienced here in the Mission.\n\nMy overall rating for the restaurant is a 2 *star*.

My only previous experiences with arepas was a little place in Aptos, CA...that was in business well over a decade ago. I forget the name of the place, but frequented it often.\n\nGF and I arrived around 3:30 for a late lunch, and decided to order 3 different arepas so that we could try the flavors. We got the Grilled Chicken, Shredded Beef Pabell\u00f3n, and the Blackened Beef Asado. All were made to order, and took about 12 minutes to be served. \n\nThe place is very small, and we sat at a table in the corner near the door, and large picture window that opened to the street. It was very cold today, and it was a bit of a surprise that the window was wide open, and both of the fans in the restaurant were on. We had jackets, and didn't make a fuss about it, but seems like a bit of an oversight. \n\nAnyway, on to the arepas. They had extremely generous portions of the protein, and were served with a slide of simple cabbage slaw. For me, the plaintains in both of the beef arepas were just too sweet, and so I ended up pulling them out. \n\nThe grilled chicken was my favorite, and it had a nice smoky flavor to it, the Shredded Beef Pabell\u00f3n was #2, and the Blackend Beef Asado pulled in at #3 out of three. \n\nMy main nitpick is that due to the generous amount of protein, there was no easy way to get a perfect bite of all the flavors other than to fork and knife it (perhaps by design). Fortunately they offer plastic forks and knives at each table. I also felt that to get a completely satisfying bite, the sauces really needed to be included, and I would definitely recommend including the slaw in every bite.\n\nThe Mojo (vinegar + heat) is definitely the right stuff. They had three other sauces at the table, one that was kind of spicy chipotle mayo, another that tasted like it had cilantro and lime, and the bright red one was basically ketchup + red pepper, and I wouldn't recommend it (unless you like ketchup). \n\nBottom line after a single visit: Pica Pica seems like a great place for folks seeking a decent gluten free meal. It didn't knock my socks off, but it's a cool spot with some interesting combinations of flavors, and very good protein to dollar ratio.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-04-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I believe it was the Shredded Beef Pabell\u00f3n Cachapas with plantains.

Not a lot of seating so it's not great for a large group of people. Expect to have to wait for a table if it's busy or plan to take your food to go. They're known for their arepas, or corn pockets, but they also have other things like rice plates, cachapas (sweet corn crepes) and salads.\n\nI've been back twice now and tried the cachapas and the arepas, both of which you can choose the meat filling (beef, pork, chicken, veggie). The CACHAPAS ($14.50) are served with a side salad and bigger in portion size. The AREPAS ($10) are served with a small cup of cole slaw (light and sweet/tangy rather than mayo based) and are honestly pretty tiny and feel more like a pricey snack rather than a meal. I've had both the white corn arepa and yellow corn, and definitely prefer the sweet yellow corn. The white corn was flavorless, but I did like the crisp, grilled exterior.\n\n* SPICY CHICKEN CATIRA - 4.5/5\n[mozzarella cheese, greens, tomato, pica'pun]\nI got my spicy chicken without cheese in the cachapa and thought it was delicious! The chicken was soft and moist. The flavor honestly just tasted like a less sweet, less thick version of BBQ sauce mixed with thousand island, but I enjoyed it. Not very spicy. I loved the sweet corn crepe! Soft and chewy with some slightly crispier parts. I only wish the sauce didn't make the crepe soggy at the bottom.\n\n* GRILLED CHICKEN - 3.5/5\n[black bean puree, tomato, queso fresco, guasacaca]\nI got the grilled chicken on the white corn arepa and thought it was lacking flavor overall. The grilled chicken was tender but simple in flavor, and probably would have paired better with the sweet corn. I'm not a fan of beans so I was a little hesitant about the black bean puree, but it was a great consistency and not overpowering. Probably the healthiest meat option.\n\n* CRISPY CHICKEN - 3/5\n[spicy pickled mojo, lettuce, jicama, tomato, aioli, guasacaca]\nNot particularly crispy, kind of dry and also lacking flavor. Between this and the grilled chicken, I thought the grilled chicken was better since it was at least tender.\n\n* YUCA FRIES ($5.25) - 3/5\nMeh. If you like thick cut potato fries, you'd probably like these. I prefer thin, crisp fries, so I wasn't as fond of these. Very thick cut, drier than normal fries and pretty bland unless you douse them in sauce. At least they weren't super greasy and had some crispness on the outside.\n\nOverall, solid food, but depends on the meat you get.

It needed more flavor, more acid, more everything. We also got a grilled chicken plato, which was pretty good, the winner on the plate was the coconut rice.

Not a lot of seating so it's not great for a large group of people. Expect to have to wait for a table if it's busy or plan to take your food to go. They're known for their arepas, or corn pockets, but they also have other things like rice plates, cachapas (sweet corn crepes) and salads.\n\nI've been back twice now and tried the cachapas and the arepas, both of which you can choose the meat filling (beef, pork, chicken, veggie). The CACHAPAS ($14.50) are served with a side salad and bigger in portion size. The AREPAS ($10) are served with a small cup of cole slaw (light and sweet/tangy rather than mayo based) and are honestly pretty tiny and feel more like a pricey snack rather than a meal. I've had both the white corn arepa and yellow corn, and definitely prefer the sweet yellow corn. The white corn was flavorless, but I did like the crisp, grilled exterior.\n\n* SPICY CHICKEN CATIRA - 4.5/5\n[mozzarella cheese, greens, tomato, pica'pun]\nI got my spicy chicken without cheese in the cachapa and thought it was delicious! The chicken was soft and moist. The flavor honestly just tasted like a less sweet, less thick version of BBQ sauce mixed with thousand island, but I enjoyed it. Not very spicy. I loved the sweet corn crepe! Soft and chewy with some slightly crispier parts. I only wish the sauce didn't make the crepe soggy at the bottom.\n\n* GRILLED CHICKEN - 3.5/5\n[black bean puree, tomato, queso fresco, guasacaca]\nI got the grilled chicken on the white corn arepa and thought it was lacking flavor overall. The grilled chicken was tender but simple in flavor, and probably would have paired better with the sweet corn. I'm not a fan of beans so I was a little hesitant about the black bean puree, but it was a great consistency and not overpowering. Probably the healthiest meat option.\n\n* CRISPY CHICKEN - 3/5\n[spicy pickled mojo, lettuce, jicama, tomato, aioli, guasacaca]\nNot particularly crispy, kind of dry and also lacking flavor. Between this and the grilled chicken, I thought the grilled chicken was better since it was at least tender.\n\n* YUCA FRIES ($5.25) - 3/5\nMeh. If you like thick cut potato fries, you'd probably like these. I prefer thin, crisp fries, so I wasn't as fond of these. Very thick cut, drier than normal fries and pretty bland unless you douse them in sauce. At least they weren't super greasy and had some crispness on the outside.\n\nOverall, solid food, but depends on the meat you get. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other meat options or even their nachos or salads (yes, those looked good too), but might pass on the arepas since they're rather small.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I like the pulled pork and grilled chicken the best.

Yuca are roots - so the taste is a tad different than potatoes. They taste great with their red sauce. Get this as a side, because 3 yuca fries and my arepa definitely filled me up.\n\nIn addition, to their arepas, they also have bowls, salads, and these taro and plantain chips with meat and sauce I'm so coming back for to try! \n\nSERVICE: \nFriendly and effective.

Fortunately they offer plastic forks and knives at each table. I also felt that to get a completely satisfying bite, the sauces really needed to be included, and I would definitely recommend including the slaw in every bite.\n\nThe Mojo (vinegar + heat) is definitely the right stuff. They had three other sauces at the table, one that was kind of spicy chipotle mayo, another that tasted like it had cilantro and lime, and the bright red one was basically ketchup + red pepper, and I wouldn't recommend it (unless you like ketchup). \n\nBottom line after a single visit: Pica Pica seems like a great place for folks seeking a decent gluten free meal.

Sometimes, after building something up in your head for so long, the actual experience can't possibly compete. I'm glad to say that isn't the situation at all at Pica Pica. If you've heard good things, expect to experience good things. \n\nIn all my years of gorging on comida latina (I hope I said that correctly, otherwise it looks REALLY pervy), I don't think I'd ever had Venezuelan fare. Because of some cuties from Caracas, it had been on my radar, but I hadn't had the chance to try it. I was missing out. To start with, I ordered a passion fruit fresca. By now, readers should be well aware of my addiction to fruit (juice). I was in fresca overload. Every sip made me want to be in South America. I could have consumed a gallon of the good stuff. Definitely order it. Also? Pace yourself. One arepa might not sound like a lot but it and a couple of sides will be enough to satisfy without turning you in to a fattyfatfatfat. I opted for the sweet yellow corn arepa topped with grilled chicken, black beans, tomato, queso fresco, and Guasacaca sauce (which is magically delicious and a ton of fun to say). To the main course, I added sides of coconut garlic rice and taro chips. AND, to the arepa, I added a variety of the delectable sauces that were on the table (try 'em all).\n\nThe meal... delicious. Absolutely delicious. I'm a voracious eater and between everything I had set before me, I was more than satisfied. I knew I was a fan of arepas but between the yellow corn base and fantastic toppings, I was in culinary heaven. Truly, every bite was a blend of wonderfully satisfying flavor. But, there was more; there was dessert. Before that night, I probably would have passed on yuca beignets and that would have been a mistake. Not only were these beignets reminiscent of donut holes, they were served with a dulce de leche dipping sauce. Done. Done! How can you not be fatkid happy with that kind of sweet treat to close out the meal?

They were each $5. \n\nMy friends shared the Pabellon since I don't eat beef. But anyway, they both really liked it and thought it was good. We all shared my chicken one and we all agreed that it was HELLA good! There was just something about the creaminess of the avocado that went really well with the chicken. \n\nWe came back for a second round and this time my friends had the Pernil (pulled pork, sliced tomatoes, avocado) and I had the Caribe (black beans, cheese, plantains). We also got a side order of plantains and it came out to $15. \n\nBy this time, we were already stuffed after making a few pit-stops at the other food trucks but we just had to get more arepas. My friends thought that the pork one was ok. They liked the steak one better. My vegetarian one was pretty good. I loved the black beans! The plantains were alright.\n\nOverall, this was by far our favorite food stand amongst the others we tried. Hopefully, we can make it out to the Mission to visit the actual restaurant and indulge in the full size arepas!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-04-02"}], "vegan": [{"excerpts": ["There are a variety of fillings, but we chose the Spicy Chicken, Asado Negro, and vegan options.\n\n"], "author": "Sophie W.", "review": "Pica Pica has a pica my heart... hahaahah\n\nI've walked past this place on countless treks to the Mission, and I was so excited when my boyfriend said he was in the mood for tortillas.

There are a variety of fillings, but we chose the Spicy Chicken, Asado Negro, and vegan options.\n\nEven before our arepas arrived, I was already so excited by the number of sauces that this place offered. There were three types of aioli-type sauces, as well as a hot (?) sauce in big glass bottles. After lusting over other people's arepas, which were gaping open and showing the treasures within, we finally got our order. The arepas came looking adorably small but stuffed with fat plantains and meat, along with a side of slaw. \n\nPro tip: try everything separately before you have it all together! Only then will you get that crumbliness of the cornmeal wrap, the sweet juiciness of the plantain, and the smokiness of the meat... And there are so many more fillings and sides to try, along with the sweet corn tortillas that they also offer!\n\nI have now made it my mission to get this place to cater at our next work event.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["There are three different vegan filling choices.

I also caved into my yearnings and  ordered the smashed, crispy plantain cake and the yucca fries, oh and a small side of avocado.\n\nI don't know what happened since the previous week,  but Oh my good GOD!  The food was amazing.  AMAZING.  The arepa was transformed and made a thing of utter bloody perfection by the omission of boring mushy tofu and the take-over by the sweet plantain. A genius move by me (thank you me).  The slightly sweet plantain, the earthy black beans and the finely chopped, herbed tomatoes were a perfect marriage, and their take on guacamole that I smeared with abandon on the roof of the cornbread nearly had me in tears.  My eyes tolled reverentially to the heavens.  I was undone with joy.  Oh Jesus..... and the fries.....oh, bloody hell they were salty, garlicky, crispy and left a yummy film of oiliness on my lips.  Oh feck.  I was in LOVE.  Right in the middle of it; if love was a spinning of flavours and textures and gorgeousness then I was at its CORE.  Ha, ha.  I could of laughed at the joy of it all.  I was so happy I could of danced on the tables and done star jumps all the way to the counter before planting a huge smacker on the chef's fissog and bursting out onto the street to tell the WORLD of the scrumminess I'd discovered!

So, for our first visit my friends chose the Pabellon (skirt steak, black beans, plantains) and I had the Pepeada (chicken salad w/ avocado). They were each $5. \n\nMy friends shared the Pabellon since I don't eat beef. But anyway, they both really liked it and thought it was good. We all shared my chicken one and we all agreed that it was HELLA good! There was just something about the creaminess of the avocado that went really well with the chicken. \n\nWe came back for a second round and this time my friends had the Pernil (pulled pork, sliced tomatoes, avocado) and I had the Caribe (black beans, cheese, plantains). We also got a side order of plantains and it came out to $15. \n\nBy this time, we were already stuffed after making a few pit-stops at the other food trucks but we just had to get more arepas. My friends thought that the pork one was ok. They liked the steak one better. My vegetarian one was pretty good. I loved the black beans! The plantains were alright.\n\nOverall, this was by far our favorite food stand amongst the others we tried.

I absolutely LOVE corn, so naturally I'd be super excited to try a self-proclaimed maize kitchen.  \n\nHowever, after eating here last night, I was really disappointed. I came here with one of my favorites and we ended up ordering 4 things: a pabellon arepa, a pabellon maize'wich, garlic Yucca fries w/aioli, and tajadas (sweet plantains). \n\nThe cool thing about this place is that it enables you to personalize your order a bit. You start with picking one maize bread (arepa, maize'wich, or cachapa) and then continue on to choose a filling (too many options to list). The one we both opted for, pabellon, consisted of shredded beef, sweet plantains, black beans, and queso fresco. Sounds awesome, ya? Well, it wasn't :( \n\nThe primary culprit preventing them from attaining awesomeness? THE PLANTAINS. \n\nWhere do I begin? The plantains were horrible. Both the tajadas and the ones tucked into our pabellon dishes. There aren't very many things I like to eat soft and mushy; however, plantains are one of the few. I like 'em soggy, wet, moist, and sweet. But the plantains here were dry, hard, and too oily. No amount of cheese, meat, or sauce could mask their nasty taste. Sadness! \n\nThe one thing I truly enjoyed about our meal were the Yucca fries. These babies were delicious. Especially with the garlic smothered all over them. The aioli dipping sauce served on the side was pretty bomb too.  \n\nIf it weren't for the plantains, I think I would have enjoyed my meal a lot more.

By now, readers should be well aware of my addiction to fruit (juice). I was in fresca overload. Every sip made me want to be in South America. I could have consumed a gallon of the good stuff. Definitely order it. Also? Pace yourself. One arepa might not sound like a lot but it and a couple of sides will be enough to satisfy without turning you in to a fattyfatfatfat. I opted for the sweet yellow corn arepa topped with grilled chicken, black beans, tomato, queso fresco, and Guasacaca sauce (which is magically delicious and a ton of fun to say). To the main course, I added sides of coconut garlic rice and taro chips. AND, to the arepa, I added a variety of the delectable sauces that were on the table (try 'em all).\n\nThe meal... delicious. Absolutely delicious. I'm a voracious eater and between everything I had set before me, I was more than satisfied.

The white arepa is a thing of beauty: made only from corn, it mimics the crispy chewiness of an English muffin. The yellow arepa is closer in consistency to a pancake.\n\nPacked with meat, and together with a side of yuca fries and chipotle catsup, one arepa sandwich makes for a highly satisfying and flavorful meal. The \"fruit frescas\" are a bit on the sweet side, but they do help tame the spice of the meal.\n\nFor dessert (if you have room) you'll want to check out the coconut quesillo, a Venezuelan version of cr\u00e8me caramel, and the yuca beignets (need I say more?).", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-11-19"}], "cider": [{"excerpts": ["They still have beer on tap (but they do offer a delicious cider!)"], "author": "Charlie D.", "review": "Of the options in the gluten free range; this is a good one. \nEverything here is gluten free, and is quite good! \nThey still have beer on tap (but they do offer a delicious cider!)", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-03-05"}], "sodas": [{"excerpts": ["Oh and forget to find Malta or Colita, they only have regular sodas.

It's an order-at-the-counter sort of place, so just walk right up.  The menu is simpler than it appears - Choose your wrapping, then choose your filling.  Done.\n\nThe Arepas is sort of like a corn version of a thick pita - it's got the texture, flavor & consistency much like lightly fried polenta, with an almost crispyness to the edge.  Very good.  I went with the Pabellon filling, which is shredded skirt steak that was seriously as tender as perfect pulled pork.  Fantastic!  Also nice chunks of fried plantain, black beans, and cheese.  This was pretty much awesome, and way more filling than I expected.  Pretty comparable to a medium-sized burrito.\n\nI also tried the empanadas, which arrive as a set of 3, and are of the thin, deep fried variety.  Be warned - they come HOT!  I got the black bean & cheese option, and they were tasty, but on the greasy side.  They're also pretty small.\n\nEverything comes with a dipping sauce (there are a few different options, mostly based on spiciness I think), which all seem to be mayo blended with various things.  Reasonably tasty, but thick & mayo-y.\n\nThey have a few beers and wines available, as well as a standard selection of sodas & such.\n\nPica Pica is definitely a fast-food sort of place - it's small, ain't fancy, but is clean and well designed for quick turnover.  They're open until 10, and the food is tasty, and totally filling for $8, which is only a bit more expensive than a burrito, so in my book, that's a win.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-06-01"}, {"excerpts": ["It came to over $25 for those two dishes, which were pretty small, and two sodas.
