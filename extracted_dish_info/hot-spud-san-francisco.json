I told the gentleman that I didn't qualify because I was actually working out of a North Beach office for the day, and he told me that was close enough and he still gave me the 10 percent off!  I took my food to the big communal table to enjoy.\n\nThe hot soup was delicious.  The clear broth was slightly peppery in flavor and loaded with an assortment of fresh vegetables and lots of baby shrimp.  My potato was outstanding.  I'm pretty certain the potatoes are scrubbed so if you feel like being hearty you can eat these with the skin and all.  The skins were rubbed with some salt though so I just stuck to eating the potato without the skin.  The very generous portion of grilled steak in my potato was lean and tender and all of the flavors just worked very well together.\n\nWhy the half star deduction?  When I finished my meal and went to discard the paper tray, the potato skin, my napkin and the compostable utensils I was shocked not to find a compost bin anywhere.

My stuffed jacket potato I quickly ordered was the Veggie Spud.  I liked to assume my choice of having greens in my spud relate to what's uncontrollably growing out of the big potato in a make up sci-fi movie, a perfect creation for my taste spud.  I chose Alfredo sauce, but that's fine if I end up with a scoop of sour cream unto my Veggie Spud; as long as everything is delicious. With a free cup of water, I finished my meal and leave after that.\n\nLove how Turkish workers make stuffed jacket potatoes.  The ingredients they use are gluten free and MSG free.
