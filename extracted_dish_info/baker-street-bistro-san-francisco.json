Got a nice window seat with pillows which was really spacious and comfy.  Ordered a bottle of the best rose they had.  He offered for me to taste it and I said to just pour and he made me feel like a turd for not tasting the wine.  It was a fifty dollar bottle do we really have to go through with this?  Oh how the French can unknowingly make us feel like the uncultured animals that we are lol.  He was cool but there you have it.  My mom is a French native and I have been to France and Paris more times than I can remember so our \"Parisian Style\" server was exactly that to the T.\nAfter the wine came he fired all of our app's and loaded up our table like it was a Chinese food restaurant.  It worked out well since two of our app's were molten straight from the broiler but it was his call to bring out four dishes all at once.  \n\nWe had four app's and I had no problem finishing my steak frite salad.\n\nThe goat cheese salad had a great vinaigrette and diced tomato garnish.  It was good.  The goat cheese was bread crusted and deep fried in their frier. Portion was good to big.\n\nThe half dozen oysters were sweet and delicious.  Served on a bed of Ice with lemon and a mild mignonette.  Sweet small tasty fresh oysters shucked with no shell broken into the meat.\n\nMy wife loved the escargot.  I thought it was good too.  I noticed that they use tarragon in the butter which I was ok with but IMO is too sweet for escargot.  I still had no problem eating this buttery delicious dish.  \n\nThe onion soup was perfect.  Not too much crouton inside, cheese all over the bowl and toasted nicely.  Perfect gratin.  Excellent savoir.  Lots of broth.  Not too many onions.  Overflowing and spilling all over the soup charger when you crack into it.  Best balance of onion soup ingredients in a bowl in SF for sure.  Not like a chowder like often results even when I make the stuff.  \n\nMy wife had the mussels and the tarragon was completely blowing the dish away. Cream in mussels is already pushing it for me but the tarragon was a deal breaker for me at this point.  No mussel envy as I ate my entire steak frite salad.  I think even the compound butter on my steak had tarragon but it was not killing the steak which I happily ate up with a side of french mustard.  I love steak frite salad.  I think it is one of my favorites.  The steak here was a bit on the smaller side no more than 8oz. for sure.  Trimmed more than I like but it was good.  Excellent Frites.  Good salad.\n\nMy wife loves dessert so she ordered one for each of us.... I ordered a Chimay and they brought and poured me a Duvel.  No complaints from me but, heyo?\n\nThe creme brulee was good to excellent.  Vanilla beans on the bottom and all.  Snappy and not too eggy with a strawberry garnish.  \n\nThe Chocolate mousse was excellent.  I took one bite of it and the whole meal pretty much kicked in and I was KO'ed for the night.  I slept so good after this meal.  Better than I had in a long time.  That says a lot.  I will be back for sure to try their brunch maybe.  The photos of the Steak with a slice of foie look incredible.  \n\nWith tip we easily spent over $200 eating like royalty.  \n\nI will be back for the $22 prix fix chefs choice menu for sure as well.

We booked an open table rezzie for a somewhat spontaneous group dinner for a 40th bday for 8 people at 8 pm on Saturday evening. While open table confirmed the reservation for 8 pm, the restaurant called and left a message for an 8:30 start instead. No problem. \n\nHowever, When the group arrived, the server advised that the kitchen closed in an hour and everyone needed to hurry and get their order in. So, while they pushed out our start time by 30 mins we needed to hurry up and order. As a former server of a fast paced higher end seafood grill, I understand how the kitchen works and that it's nice to close up shop in a timely manner. But asking a group to come in later and then rushing them to order - was the first offputting event of the evening. Also, an 8 pm dinner on a Saturday night is hardly a late night dinner.  \n\nNext, as she took the drink order, she singled out one of our group, the wife of the 40 year old and advised that she would give everyone drinks except her. The server said it loudly and in an Unkind way which was mortifying for our guest basically implying that she was too drunk to be served. My friend had a drink or two before dinner but was in no way, shape or form, sloppy or out of hand. We actually applaud when a server makes an assessment to decline drinks to someone who has been previously overserved but there were two problems with this: 1)she focused on the wrong person in the group (admittedly there were others who had been overserved) and 2)she said it in a way that was humiliating and loud. Even if she truly believed our friend was too drunk to continue to be served, she could have very easily said it in a more professional way.  This was how the meal started. Not good. \n\nThe group had to make a fast decision to either stay and eat or to leave based on the very poor service and attitude but given the time of not and the size of the group, we decided to stick it out. Bad idea!\n\nThe server and one other staff member proceeded to sit and linger across from the table, while we finished our meal further adding to a very uncomfortable experience for what should have been a super fun night. \n\nIf the restaurant didn't want a group of 8,at 8 pm on a Saturday night,they should not have accepted the reservation. \n\nI am born and raised in San Francisco as were several others at the table.

I totally feel for her as I've probably been mistaken for a tranny with my quad layer caked on make-up, tattooed eyebrows, and triple stacked whore lashes mid-day. Sadly, not everyone can be as fortunate. \n\nBaker Street Bistro IS that \"unfortunate\" sibling. One of my most memorable meals last year was at its sister restaurant, Bistro Central Parc (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-central-parc-san-francisco#hrid:8iXzFqkMP-OUolQ737sZkg). There, the food was just as amazing as the service which was a complete opposite from my experience at Baker Street Bistro.\n\nF O O D\nNeeding to feed my foie gras addiction before the upcoming ban in 10 days, I dragged Mr. NSS here because they had three featured foie gras dishes which is the only reason I choose Baker Street Bistro for dinner. \n\n*Escargot Bourguignon in Garlic & Parsley Sauce ($10.50) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#V8MQpBbNqjwetBABV2va_A\nThe best part of our meal, the escargot was tenderly soft with a tantalizing garlicky herbaceousness.\n \n*Pan Seared Foie Gras & Smoked Duck Breast w/ Pine Nuts & Duck Gizzard Confit Salad ($16.50) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#TYWWiz3J2mPo91QQWMd9uw\nSurprisingly, the smoked duck breast was the winner in the dish. It was rich and tender with just the right amount of smoky flavor to awaken my taste buds. The foie gras tasted like almost like regular liver and lacked the quintessential rich decadence.    \n\n*Tournedos Rossini: Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Topped w/ Pan Seared Foie Gras ($29) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#ZLuekYfJ7-0-WebCba8RiA\nThe Tournedos Rossini was a disappointment both in quality and execution. The bland beef tenderloin was difficult to cut and had tons of fibrous connective tissue having not been broken down making the steak extra chewy (at least my mouth got a work out). The lack of richness from the foie gras and the watery demi-glace made this dish utterly disappointing. \n\nPoor Mr. NSS's dish looked like a reduced fat dinner plate which he didn't like. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#gLaYkZwsOkUb87v5wmydeQ\n\nS E R V I C E\nContrived friendliness with a complete lack of attentiveness is not what I expected from a seemingly charming neighborhood restaurant especially after having received such warm, genuine, and attentive service from its sister restaurant, Bistro Central Parc. Mr. NSS had to go inside to ask for the bill and go back inside to pay for it. A bit inexcusable. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nParisian bistro meets French country nook with crisp white linen tables, outdoor patio seating, yellow hued walls, and rustic wooden furnishings. Seating is tight and meant for small parties no more than four. \n\nP A R K I N G\nModerate to difficult street parking. \n\nWith just less than 10 days before the foie gras ban, Baker Street Bistro is not a place I would recommend to indulge in your foie gras' desires. When you bite into foie gras, a burst of luxurious richness should coat every crevice of your mouth and have you grinning from ear-to-ear. It should make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. The foie gras at Baker Street Bistro was like boring, mediocre, and mundane sex. *yawn* If you want mind-blowing \"sex\", please do yourself a favor and go to La Folie or Alexander's Steakhouse before the ban.\n\nUnless you like boring, mediocre, and mundane \"sex\" than by all means.

It was good.  The goat cheese was bread crusted and deep fried in their frier. Portion was good to big.\n\nThe half dozen oysters were sweet and delicious.  Served on a bed of Ice with lemon and a mild mignonette.  Sweet small tasty fresh oysters shucked with no shell broken into the meat.\n\nMy wife loved the escargot.  I thought it was good too.  I noticed that they use tarragon in the butter which I was ok with but IMO is too sweet for escargot.  I still had no problem eating this buttery delicious dish.  \n\nThe onion soup was perfect.  Not too much crouton inside, cheese all over the bowl and toasted nicely.  Perfect gratin.  Excellent savoir.  Lots of broth.  Not too many onions.

I think even the compound butter on my steak had tarragon but it was not killing the steak which I happily ate up with a side of french mustard.  I love steak frite salad.

Good salad.\n\nMy wife loves dessert so she ordered one for each of us.... I ordered a Chimay and they brought and poured me a Duvel.  No complaints from me but, heyo?\n\nThe creme brulee was good to excellent.  Vanilla beans on the bottom and all.  Snappy and not too eggy with a strawberry garnish.  \n\nThe Chocolate mousse was excellent.  I took one bite of it and the whole meal pretty much kicked in and I was KO'ed for the night.

Well, let's start not with the food but with the ambiance, a funky \"Paris-bistro\" decor marred only by the unwillingness of the oh-so-trendy couple who were unwilling to even suggest to their bratty hooligan 8-year old that he restrain himself. \"Isn't he cute, climbing the bar and spilling the drinks?\"  \"Isn't he precocious, opening the door with the handicapped push-plate - and keeping it open so all that nice, cool fog could come into the restaurant?\"  Until my wife yelled at the little monster to close the door!

I had the boeuf bourguignon.  It's a dish I've made dozens of times and enjoyed in bistros all over the world.  Not here.  First of all, the beef was tough and flavorless, sure signs of it having sat on the stove, simmering, for the better part of hours.  The dish tasted strongly of celery and undercooked wine, which tells me the chef doesn't have a clue about how and when to add his aromatics.  It was as insipid a dish as I've ever had, an effort that my children could easily surpass.\n\nI'd love to tell you that my wife's scallops were better but I'd be lying if I did.  She was presented with a beautiful plate but the scallops were brutally overcooked.  What flavor was left was sharp and astringent, with a tough and unforgiving texture. They were presented on a puree of potatoes and broccoli, which I thought was a rather odd combo for scallops - and it didn't work.\n\nThe only dish at the table was our dinner companion's steak frittes - it's pretty hard to screw that up.  And, no, we didn't accept the dessert offerings.\n\nI dined here maybe 20 years ago and remembered it as being half decent.  Today, I'd cut that 50% by 90%.

If we didn't already order the terrine, I'd have attacked the pate like there was no tomorrow.  It was so good that I decided we needed to box it up and eat it the next day.  Which is today, and I can still tell you it was delicious. \n\nOur main course arrived with generous portions of food.  Tried a bite of fiance's NY Steak and found it acceptable, but not stellar.  My seafood stew on the other hand was wonderful.  Most seafood stews I've had had an overabundance of tomato, but the seafood broth for this dish was flavorful without taking away the individual flavors of the seafood inside.  The side of risotto was also delicious.\n\nBy the time the profiteroles came along, I was more than pleasantly full.  The ice cream was teeth hurting cold, which made the chocolate sauce harden.  But it was wonderfully good.  Many restaurants don't serve this, but when I do get my fix, it's most certainly a treat.\n\nLast but certainly not least, the waiters were superb.  It might have to do with the fact we were the last diners of the evening, but our glasses were always full, never had a moment to complain about.  We had wonderful service.\n\nCons:  Despite the mostly glowing review above, there were a few small things which make me unfortunately give this place a solid 4 rather than the 5 stars I so wanted.\n\nI found Krab with a \"K\" in my seafood stew.  Now, I'm not an entire snob, but Krab with a \"K\" had no place in there.  I'm a firm believer that if you do not have the actual decent ingredient, you don't put it in.  I definitely think it didn't need to be there, and the dish would have turned out equally wonderful.  So yes, slightly disillusioned now that the seafood stew was not perfect after all.\n\nAlso, I was not in love with the escargot dish.  I think it's one of those things where the garlic butter sauce completely overpowered the escargot to the point I couldn't really tell what I was eating.  To be honest, the size and the quality could have been better for the price they charged.  Slightly disappointed.  But completely forgotten after eating a piece of the foie gras terrine (see the raving positive comments above).\n\nAnd lastly, I was slightly disappointed when they refused to let me get a box for the remains of my seafood stew.  They worried I might get food poisoning if I took it home with us, and did not pack it for me to go.  Was somewhat upset that they made that determination for me.  Which noble in their intent to cover their butts if I die of food poisoning, that was my call to make.  Plus, had I known they wouldn't have let me take it home, I'd have finished all my mussels!  Argh!\n\nBottom line:  I would definitely come here again.  And I would skip the escargot.  And not share the foie gras terrine, because it's awesome.  And the best part of the night - despite all the binge ordering, the meal came out before tip, under $100.  Imagine that!  If I live in the city, I'd most assuredly come back whenever I'd like a bistro fix.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-03-07"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered mimosas and the mussels and seafood stew.

Wow, she was so attentive to what we did and didn't eat and constantly asking us why or why not... ). \n\nI can't explain it, but there are a lot of things that are very important that are hard to measure on spreadsheets.

It was really neat. There are farmers in France and they eat food that's very different from what's usually presented.

Thanks.\"\n\nOkay, so the waitress does one of these Euro type hmmmphs, tilts her head to the right, and ROLLS HER EYES!!!  I know in her head, she is thinking, \"Theeese steww-pid Ah-merhi-CAN with their gauche ways!! I can't beleeeve she wants it medium.  Sacre bleu!!!\"\n\nAnyway, it set me off and was unnecessary and rude.  This just further adds to my stereotypes of French people.  However karma is a bitch, she broke two glasses throughout the evening.\n\nSo I got my steak, I'm not a hypocrite, it was good, it wasn't too bloody, and it was a nice cut of meat.  However, I could have done without the eye rolling.  The shallot tarragon butter?  It tasted like regular butter.  But who knows, I may not be that discerning in taste since I didn't know New York steak is best served medium rare.

Next time, and there will be one.  This place is fantastic! Also, some great friends live a block from here and frequent this place all the time.

I just think it's not that well known or as faddish as other places.  There's outdoor seating to enjoy when the smallish interior gets too crowded.  I always order the bouillabase - subtle, red fishy broth, tender scallops and other goodies, topped with a perfectly toasted slice of baguette and pepper aioli.  The other week, my family and I also tried the risotto for a late brunch - it came speckled with squash, beet, and sundried tomatoes - a perfect summertime dish.  It was delicious - not too mushy or overrun with ingredients.  The fluffy french toast is also an excellent standby.  As for the service, there are several attentive and friendly waiters to assist.  The owner also frequently emerges from the back to shmooze with regulars and newcomers alike. (I did find it strange when he chose to dump along the street a bucketful of dirty washwater just outside his place - bad choice!).  The only drawback I see for this place, besides its somewhat remote location over by the Presidio, is its espresso drinks.  They just aren't that strong or flavorful.  I like my cappuccinos dry and theirs was decidedly weak.  Alas, I will return in spite of that.  Again and again.  Sitting outside, with a mellow breeze and fog blowing over, with its quiet atmosphere, gives me images of being at a lazy brasserie in France.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-08-14"}, {"excerpts": ["We frequent Chouchou in the forest hill neighborhood and can say that, by comparison, there is no comparison.

French bistro cuisine is one of my favorites, so on my birthday, my wife, daughter and I had to give it a try. At best it was just okay. The ambiance and decor are warm and inviting. The service is friendly and sharp. Our only complaint is the food wasn't so great. I started with the salad with smoked duck, duck gizzard and foie gras. The smoked duck had no smoke flavor, the gizzard was like jerky, but the foie gras was good. The \"Julia Child\" beef bourginon was salty, the beef was dried out and the sauce lacked complexity. Simply one note flavor like canned stew but WAY saltier than canned. My wife's duck a l'orange was very good. It was served with polenta cakes and she does not like polenta. She asked if she could substitute any other sort of starch and it was made clear that there are \"no substitutions\" as stated at the bottom of the menu. These days, I would think restaurants would be a little more accommodating with a SIMPLE request like a side starch substitution. My daughter's steak was just that, a steak with fries and a small side of vinaigrette salad. Nothing special. Sad to say, but \"you can get that anywhere\". We did not partake of the desserts. We frequent Chouchou in the forest hill neighborhood and can say that, by comparison, there is no comparison.  Chouchou is our favorite.

Foie gras was spot on, and accompanying grapes and apple compote were also delicious.\n2) Escargot - Can't go wrong with snails, butter and garlic.\n3) Cheese Platter - this was kind of underwhelming - standard camembert, brie, roquefort, and a couple of other hard cheeses thrown in. Not my favorite.\n4) Charcuterie - It was ok, but I wouldn't say this was my favorite either - nothing stellar to note except for the tasty pate in the middle.

Over 10 minutes later, I went back inside to tell her that we would be fine sitting outside,  but that we were hungry. She said OK, but was distracted (because she was also a server). We went back to waiting outside. There were a few tables available and had I been functioning, I would have just sat in one, but I wasn't, so we continued to wait outside. Another server (male with a friendly smile) came over to us and asked us if we had been helped. I explained and he offered us a seat.

I had an egg white omlette with Swiss cheese and onions and a decaf coffee. They did not refill the coffee until I specifically asked for it.  And then, the coffee she used to refill my cup with caffeinated. Besides that, I liked that they had Benedict options (some vegetarian) and parking was not too hard to find. I do wish though that they had had a vegan dish or two and not charged so many extra fees for the eggs. Omlette was something like 8 dollars, egg whites was an additional 1.50, cheese .75, and onions .75.  I felt nickle and dimed.
