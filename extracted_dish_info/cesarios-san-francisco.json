I was so hungry that I devoured every bit of it.  We all cleaned our plates so that is always a good sign.  My friend said the chicken garlic pasta was not very garlicy.  The risotto looked good.  I'm not a fan of salt, so this place was good in my salt meter.  Some days you just want a big bowl of pasta, so this is the place to have one.  The service was slow in the beginning, only because there are only two waitresses in the whole place.  Can't fault them for that.  They were attentive and came back to ask if we needed any and water was filled.  If you have a big party, make a reservation or else be patient in waiting.

I can't remember the name of the dish my friend ordered but it was spaghetti noodles with sun-dried tomatoes and shrimp in a \"light cream sauce.\"\n\nThe polenta alone took 20 minutes to come. Very annoying. And four pieces for $7? Ugh, I was expecting more. Oh well.
