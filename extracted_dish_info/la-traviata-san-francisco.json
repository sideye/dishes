The waiter approached, we began to order, laughing and enjoyed each others attempts to out do the others abilities to express their order in what we thought to be perfetto Italiano. With his utmost gracious manners the waiter contributed to our experience and had us all enjoying the event even more. As I remember, the conversation rolled on through basket's of hot bread, chilled butter, and two or three varieties of wine, but if my memory is correct it seems  we were very comfortable  to settle into the  Italian American traditional of a great Chianti. As the meal unfolded.  the Prosciutto e melone came and Calamari in a vinaigrette and a variety of cheeses. Then more bread and more Chianti followed by insalata fresco, spaghetti al funghi, spaghetti alle vongole, some fettuccine and gamberi, And I think.... oh yes Salmon baked in parchment with a tomato wine sauce.Oh my god...the food. I remember we were their for at least two or three hours. The waiter did not show any signs of frustration and enjoyed showing us his knowledge of the Italian dinning experience.

I'll have to settle for kinda sorta liking a few things while coming away disappointed with most. \n\nWe got off to a bad start when I walked in and the place was at least 80 degrees. No AC.  This seems to be a San Francisco thing. I don't like sweating while I eat. Had I not made a 15 minute cab ride, I would have walked out. \n\nThe relatively small dining room is warm and elegant, with white tablecloths, upholstered chairs, and walls lined with pictures of opera singers and other assorted Italians. It was less than half full on a Friday night.  Service was professional but not super sharp. They play opera and other Italian music, which most Italian restaurants unfortunately don't. \n\nMy \"polpo vinaigrette\" appetizer was three small octopi over some field greens. The octopus was fine, but the whole thing was overdressed with too much heavy,  oily dressing (which didn't taste like olive oil). It needed more zip. \n\nThe Veal La Traviata entree was much better -- three fresh, tender, high quality slices of veal that had been lightly dredged in flour and cooked in a delicious sherry sauce that was probably a pan reduction, and topped with good prosciutto and melted mozzarella. Plus a side of spaghetti I asked for. This was a very nice dish and one you don't find just anywhere.  It was the only satisfying part of the experience, though it was marred when I discovered I had been charged 7.95 for a small portion of spaghetti with no extra sauce.  (They took off the charge after I complained.) \n\nThe $7.50 \"gelato spumone\" was just a big,  careless bowl of some run of the mill commercial spumoni ice cream you could get in a grocery store. Calling it \"gelato\" is fraud. \n\nThey have a terrific variety of Italian whites and reds by the glass. I had a vernaccia and a nebbiolo, both good, though the Nebbiolo was served much too warm, obviously because it was kept standing around in an 80 degree+ nook off the kitchen.  The pours aren't generous, and they're served in wine glasses that are too small, especially for a $14 glass of red.  (Unless you're at the owner's table in the corner. They had nice big, real wine glasses.) \n\nI guess I'm glad a place like this is still around, but it could have been so much better.  The place seems to be just coasting.

Quick hop on the BART, and quickly walking past some raucous homeless people,  they were there before you could say Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nDuring and after the dinner, the consensus around the table was an enthusiastic thumbs up. Tortellini with white sauce, with red sauce, veal, chicken, spaghetti ai funghi, minestrone, carpaccio, Bruschetta, tiramisu, creme carmel, espresso, chianti classico. All superb!\n\nMy 10 year-old son accompanied me as well, and the waiter was very accommodating. He offered to add a side of angel hair pasta and marinara sauce on the side as insurance in case the veal was not up to the young man's standards. Smart man! The insurance wasn't needed, but was fully utilized. The plate was the first one empty.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy, wait staff is friendly and helpful. They are not as \"polished\" as the popular places, and sure they aren't the quickest, but, you don't go here for polish or to get a quick bite. You come here to sit, talk, laugh, enjoy the food, let the wine soak into your soul. When you are full is when you are full, when you leave is when you leave. My 10 year-old has not adopted my philosophy however, so he took the liberties of tracking down the waiter to hand him the card. Kids these days. Back in my day Italian food meant Chef-boyardee, and we liked it!\n\nGreat date place. Great friends place.

I understand this is off-putting to many, but honestly, I cannot take another review where the atmosphere is described as \"50's kitch.\" (Oh, madonn!) Maybe that's what this place is reduced to in CA . . . and for you, I weep.\n\nListen bitches, I'm from Dirty Jersey, North Jersey to be exact, (and no, we do not say JOISEY, even motherfuckin Tony Soprano does not say JOISEY). I grew up eating at Italian-American (WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM ITALIAN)  restaurants in Newark and surrounding burbs. The kind of places where there is always at least one table of 6 morbidly obese men in ridiculous suits.  This means, that I get deeply concerned when someone in San Fran-fucking-cisco claims to have eaten at an authentic Italian-American place.   I will give some, very slight leeway if the place is in North Beach . . . because the good places generally get the food right,  but they almost ALWAYS screw up the atmosphere. You either get 1) red and white checked table cloths and \"family style service\" - I don't know what the fuck that is, but if my ass wants gnocchi and Jimmy wants Carbonara, and Mikey wants Veal Piccata, that just ain't going to cut it 2) ridiculously stylized places with perky waitstaff  and WAY, WAY too much light - i.e. Italian food goes to California (which by the way is fine when you're up for that, I am a big fan of the Delfina's of the world, but when the Italian uncles are in town I tend to Identify these places as Italian-California or the better ones \"Italian -Italy Coastal\"  but NEVER would I call any of these places Italian-American. \n\nLa Traviata on the other hand, gets it right, down to the fake single rose on all the tables.  It has a cave like layout and a sitting area which separated from the dinning room by a perfectly tacky stained glass window set in wood. Its white table cloth (of course!), and  the service is perfect:  two man tag team, one older and one younger (son, brother, cousin?), both tremendously gracious in that slightly overstated way.  I'd have given the place five stars before I ate a thing.  I was home.\n\nSome notes on Italian-AMERICAN food, because a few people have missed this distinction (and hey you just might not like it, and that's cool), there is absolutely no subtlety involved. it should be heavy garlic on garlic and the portions should be large (if you have to add salt, they've done soemthing wrong). . . what is unacceptable in this medium is overcooked pasta, bland sauces, crappy seafood and a holier than thou attitude. SO, they lost a star on my Gnocchi, it wasn't firm enough.  The Bruchetta was very good, my date's pasta did not disappoint, (I tend not to comment on Caprese unless something goes wrong because I think that's pretty hard to screw up - and they didn't).  The tiramasu was surprisingly good (I always order tiramasu with trepidation because I've seen it interpreted in some bizarre ways). \n\nI will absolutely go back.

And over the years, we forgot this place existed...until last night I was DYING for some good, solid Italian food in the Mission, which is overrun by overpriced gastropubs featuring \"New American cuisine\" (read:  stuff you could easily make at home, like mac'n'cheese or chicken pate or a burger, but with tiny portions for massively-inflated prices to reflect their degree of \"foodie-ness\"!), but runs rather painfully light in the good-solid-Italian-food department (sorry, Beretta, you just don't serve the big plate of pasta my soul and stomach both desire!)!\n\nAnd then I remembered La Traviata!  Now, I was already in my pj's and therefore not about to leave the house...so the spouse ran to get take-out for us (what a mensch!).  Therefore, my review is based solely on the quality of the food, and NOT with the actual experience one might have of dining-in.\n\nI ordered the Lasagna, which was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Very heavy on the meat and bechamel, it was a very reasonably-sized portion, and I was also pleased to find that the pasta wasn't overcooked.  \n\nI also ordered a side of Cheese Tortellini in Cream Sauce, just to see what their cream sauce is like...Mama Mia, it was absolutely fantastico!!!  Next time I dine there (which will be soon!), I'll probably be getting a full dinner portion of this dish!\n\nWe split a Caesar Salad, because, you know, vegetables..this may have been the one sort of \"eh\" part of the meal.  While the lettuce was the appropriate romaine, the dressing was not the creamy style I prefer;  rather, it was more like a vinaigrette with sizable chunks of anchovies (this part I didn't mind at all!)...and because the lettuce leaves were drenched in dressing, they were a bit on the soggy side.  Also, there didn't seem to be any croutons or shaved/shredded parmesan on top...so if those are essentials for you in enjoying a Caesar salad, that's something to note.\n\nI haven't tried it yet (I was too full last night), but the restaurant very sweetly gave us a complimentary order of Tiramisu with our order...what a generous gesture!  Hmmm, maybe that's what I should have for a mid-afternoon snack?!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this meal and will definitely either dine-in or take-out from La Traviata again.  While it isn't the best Italian food in San Francisco (seriously, try Mona Lisa!!  Just do it!!!), it was definitely very tasty, and given the dearth of good Italian food in the Mission, I'd say there's a reason this restaurant has been around as long as it has!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-05"}, {"excerpts": ["the lasagna!

Both dishes were good and enjoyable and well portioned. However, the eggplant was a touch overcooked for our taste and the steamed vegetables were run of the mill and on the bland side. To be fair, it's exactly what you would expect from a time warp. The menu likely hasn't changed since they opened in 1973 and I kind of don't mind, anything else wouldn't make sense. Highlights are the bread, like everyone has mentioned and mushroom sauce. I would come back regardless, because I get the feeling all their dishes are good and they would rarely serve a bad meal.\n\nService/Atmosphere: 4 stars.\nServers were warm and respectfully attentive. They didn't try to sell us on anything or constantly check in, but they were there when you needed them and kept a watchful eye on the tables. Their strolling around the restaurant made for a nice background ambiance. Yes, they were a little aloof, but that's what you get at old school places and I like that level of service. \n\nNote: If someone in your party has a birthday, make sure to tell the staff. They have a cute little routine with the lights and music that is adorably hokey but fun. And there's cake with candles.\n\nPrice: 2.5 stars.\nKind of hating on the price, it's true, and it's probably a bit harsh. Problem is I can get some really fancy modern food around the corner for the same cost. Prices average around $9 appetizers,  $10 salads and $18 entrees.

It is a sanctuary, it is living, backed by a story that I hope you come to know and understand from your experience there. I hope to see this place continue to thrive.\n\n A pasta craving led us to the nearest Italian eatery on Mission St. An un-assuming entryway gave way to one of the more charming dining experiences that I have had in this city for at least a few months. The interior walls are covered in a lovely collection of both family photos and those of great opera stars. The intricate ceiling is backed by a story just as interesting as the fixture itself. We came with a group of four and sipped on two bottles of the Vernaccia, why order something else when we enjoyed that bottle so much? The wine prices are super reasonable to boot. Hot, crunchy bread came to our table, and I felt that with the butter knives and pre-portioned butter, there was a particular focus on traditional dining etiquette supported here that made the experience only that much more memorable. The two servers that were managing the floor missed no detail, and were sweet as well as witty.\n\nWe ordered the Ceasar salad, which if you are looking for the classic super creamy stuff, I will advise that this salad does not meet that description. The dressing, while it still had delightful anchovy flavor, was more of a vinaigrette, which I was later grateful to have saved the extra calories for our pastas. We also shared the prosciutto and melon, a classic, I love it and you can expect no frills with this one. And finished our appetizers with the fried mozzarella with marinara, think mozzarella stick big enough for the table.. Great to share! Eat it fast tho, so the cheese stays nice and melty. \n\nWe each ordered a pasta for the main course. Two house made gnocchi, very soft and creamy in texture. One came with a pesto sauce, which sadly I didn't taste, and my choice came with the aurora (pink sauce.) The other two dishes were a hearty slice of house-made lasagna bolognese, again a very classic interpretation with not-too-big of a slab. The unanimous winning dish at our table was the pasta carbonara, in all it's creamy, pancetta glory. \n\nMy only critique about the savories, is that I felt that they were lacking in salt, but luckily that is something we easily fixed, of course. And still not worth \"losing a star\" for. \n\nWe closed the restaurant down, joined at the end only by John, the restaurants owner. They surprised us with a lovely tiramisu to end our meal which had delicious hints of orange liqueur.

They have a cute little routine with the lights and music that is adorably hokey but fun. And there's cake with candles.\n\nPrice: 2.5 stars.\nKind of hating on the price, it's true, and it's probably a bit harsh. Problem is I can get some really fancy modern food around the corner for the same cost. Prices average around $9 appetizers,  $10 salads and $18 entrees.

While the lettuce was the appropriate romaine, the dressing was not the creamy style I prefer;  rather, it was more like a vinaigrette with sizable chunks of anchovies (this part I didn't mind at all!)...and because the lettuce leaves were drenched in dressing, they were a bit on the soggy side.  Also, there didn't seem to be any croutons or shaved/shredded parmesan on top...so if those are essentials for you in enjoying a Caesar salad, that's something to note.\n\nI haven't tried it yet (I was too full last night), but the restaurant very sweetly gave us a complimentary order of Tiramisu with our order...what a generous gesture!

I ordered the salmon, which I had ordered many times there before, so i knew it did not take two hours to prepare. \n\nI told the waiter upon arrival that I was starving. We both told him to bring the food \"as it is ready\". Another guy (waiter? host? busboy? manager? One never knows at this place) also waited on our table, which seemed to only confuse matters. The two of them wasted way too much time making pleasantries rather than attending to our basic need: for food. After I had eaten half the bread basket while waiting for my meal, the waiter asked, with obvious expectations of a positive response, \"Do you feel better, now that you have filled up on bread?\" I wanted to reply, \"I will feel better when my dinner gets here,\" but I bit my tongue. \n\nI watched my friend eat his first course as I gnawed on bread and talked. Then they brought his second course, and I kept looking up expectantly, waiting for mine. Everyone else in the restaurant was getting their food except me. \n\nI asked three times about my entree. Finally, one of the waiters said he would get it right away.

They explained to her that my order came so late because it was an entree, and therefore must not come until the appetizers, soups, and pastas had been consumed. They did not even consider that the appetizers and soup were being consumed  solely by my friend, and that he had not ordered an entree. They did not consider that I was sitting there, foodless for two hours after having informed them of  my hunger, while my friend ate. They did not consider that my friend then had to sit there, having completed his dinner, and watch ME eat. \n\nMy food was cold and tasteless by the time it arrived.

I want it to be my little secret.\n\nI had out of town guests from Norway wanting to get Italian food. They wanted to get something at Fisherman's Wharf. My response to them was, tell me where you are, and I'll come pick you up and take you somewhere good. (i.e. not at Fisherman's Wharf)\n\nOriginally, I was going to go to Delfina, until I was told that it's a 4 week reservation wait for prime time spots. Screw that. My preference is always to go to places not packed. There's a myth that all the good places are packed. Certainly, lots of places are packed because they are good, but the packed places have no monopoly by any means.  There's plenty of diamond in the rough in this town, and La Traviata, being right by the 24th and Mission BART station on Mission no less, is certainly in the rough. After dining there, I can say, that it is certainly a diamond as well.\n\nWell, my Norwegian friends called me back, sounding a bit frazzled. \"There's lots of people riding on bikes, and everyone is crazy and shouting!\"  Then I realized, that today is Critical Mass, and there was no way in hell I was going to drive anywhere. Fortunately, they never made it to Fisherman's Wharf and was at the Embarcadero. Quick hop on the BART, and quickly walking past some raucous homeless people,  they were there before you could say Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nDuring and after the dinner, the consensus around the table was an enthusiastic thumbs up. Tortellini with white sauce, with red sauce, veal, chicken, spaghetti ai funghi, minestrone, carpaccio, Bruschetta, tiramisu, creme carmel, espresso, chianti classico. All superb!\n\nMy 10 year-old son accompanied me as well, and the waiter was very accommodating. He offered to add a side of angel hair pasta and marinara sauce on the side as insurance in case the veal was not up to the young man's standards. Smart man! The insurance wasn't needed, but was fully utilized. The plate was the first one empty.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy, wait staff is friendly and helpful. They are not as \"polished\" as the popular places, and sure they aren't the quickest, but, you don't go here for polish or to get a quick bite. You come here to sit, talk, laugh, enjoy the food, let the wine soak into your soul. When you are full is when you are full, when you leave is when you leave. My 10 year-old has not adopted my philosophy however, so he took the liberties of tracking down the waiter to hand him the card. Kids these days.

The kind of places where there is always at least one table of 6 morbidly obese men in ridiculous suits.  This means, that I get deeply concerned when someone in San Fran-fucking-cisco claims to have eaten at an authentic Italian-American place.   I will give some, very slight leeway if the place is in North Beach . . . because the good places generally get the food right,  but they almost ALWAYS screw up the atmosphere. You either get 1) red and white checked table cloths and \"family style service\" - I don't know what the fuck that is, but if my ass wants gnocchi and Jimmy wants Carbonara, and Mikey wants Veal Piccata, that just ain't going to cut it 2) ridiculously stylized places with perky waitstaff  and WAY, WAY too much light - i.e. Italian food goes to California (which by the way is fine when you're up for that, I am a big fan of the Delfina's of the world, but when the Italian uncles are in town I tend to Identify these places as Italian-California or the better ones \"Italian -Italy Coastal\"  but NEVER would I call any of these places Italian-American. \n\nLa Traviata on the other hand, gets it right, down to the fake single rose on all the tables.

SO, they lost a star on my Gnocchi, it wasn't firm enough.  The Bruchetta was very good, my date's pasta did not disappoint, (I tend not to comment on Caprese unless something goes wrong because I think that's pretty hard to screw up - and they didn't).  The tiramasu was surprisingly good (I always order tiramasu with trepidation because I've seen it interpreted in some bizarre ways). \n\nI will absolutely go back.

Even better was the \"Tinta\": linguine topped with (also perfectly cooked) calamari pieces and drenched in the most delicious tomato, olive oil, garlic, and squid ink sauce I've ever eaten. The ink gives the sauce a brownish color (like chipotle salsa), and though our waiter claims to have never eaten the dish because of its color, I think we convinced him he was really missing out.

And over the years, we forgot this place existed...until last night I was DYING for some good, solid Italian food in the Mission, which is overrun by overpriced gastropubs featuring \"New American cuisine\" (read:  stuff you could easily make at home, like mac'n'cheese or chicken pate or a burger, but with tiny portions for massively-inflated prices to reflect their degree of \"foodie-ness\"!), but runs rather painfully light in the good-solid-Italian-food department (sorry, Beretta, you just don't serve the big plate of pasta my soul and stomach both desire!)!\n\nAnd then I remembered La Traviata!  Now, I was already in my pj's and therefore not about to leave the house...so the spouse ran to get take-out for us (what a mensch!).  Therefore, my review is based solely on the quality of the food, and NOT with the actual experience one might have of dining-in.\n\nI ordered the Lasagna, which was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Very heavy on the meat and bechamel, it was a very reasonably-sized portion, and I was also pleased to find that the pasta wasn't overcooked.  \n\nI also ordered a side of Cheese Tortellini in Cream Sauce, just to see what their cream sauce is like...Mama Mia, it was absolutely fantastico!!!  Next time I dine there (which will be soon!), I'll probably be getting a full dinner portion of this dish!\n\nWe split a Caesar Salad, because, you know, vegetables..this may have been the one sort of \"eh\" part of the meal.  While the lettuce was the appropriate romaine, the dressing was not the creamy style I prefer;  rather, it was more like a vinaigrette with sizable chunks of anchovies (this part I didn't mind at all!)...and because the lettuce leaves were drenched in dressing, they were a bit on the soggy side.  Also, there didn't seem to be any croutons or shaved/shredded parmesan on top...so if those are essentials for you in enjoying a Caesar salad, that's something to note.\n\nI haven't tried it yet (I was too full last night), but the restaurant very sweetly gave us a complimentary order of Tiramisu with our order...what a generous gesture!  Hmmm, maybe that's what I should have for a mid-afternoon snack?!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this meal and will definitely either dine-in or take-out from La Traviata again.  While it isn't the best Italian food in San Francisco (seriously, try Mona Lisa!!  Just do it!!!), it was definitely very tasty, and given the dearth of good Italian food in the Mission, I'd say there's a reason this restaurant has been around as long as it has!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the gnocci pasta with pink sauce and cheese tortellini in cream sauce.

This once-awesome secret Italian delight has suffered horrifically in the past couple of years. The service and the food are unrecognizable, and worse, inexcusable. The one redeeming feature is an amazingly great caesar salad, almost worth its $9 price.\n\nFirst: the service. One not very charming waitress for the entire restaurant. Same waitress we had bad service from a year prior. The older guy with almost all of his teeth filled our water glasses and tossed a plate of butter on the table when we arrived, but failed to bring bread. When we asked for bread, he brought it, and then yanked a loaf out of the basket and fondled it in his palm to show us it wasn't too hot to touch. Yeah, please dont put your big paws on my food? Does that actually have to be something you ask your wait staff not to do?\n\nWe ordered the caesar, antipasti misto, the bass entree and an old fave of mine, the a la beverly sills (chicken with prosciutto in a wine caper sauce). The antipasti was not fresh - it had clearly sat out for some time and the meat was dried at the edges. It was also obviously from a package. The cheeses were clearly pre-sliced provolone and mozarella from a jar, and flavorless. To cap it, the entire contents of the plate were floating in flavorless olive oil. \n\nOur meals came with small pre-plates of tortellini. zero effort at plating, and one plate had twice the pasta and sauce as the other. Oh, and the pasta tasted suspiciously, no, *convincingly*, like Lucca Deli's down the street's cheese tortellini and marinara sauce.\n\nThe bass, we were informed, was not actually bass but some other fish I've never heard of, but when it came out it looked and tasted a whole lot like cheap tilapia. It was breaded and drowned in a wine-caper sauce. My date ate two bites and decided she wasn't hungry any more.\n\nThe a la beverly sills ... sigh. The chicken breasts were cooked perfectly, but they were stuffed with what appeared to be raw american bacon. RAW. Not prosciutto. Did I mention it was raw? Beverly, rest her soul, would be affronted.\n\nMost deflating is to discover that the italian chefs who used to populate the kitchen and venture onto the floor to generously chat with patrons are all gone. All that is left are local line cooks trying to churn out food they have no feel for. \n\nWe spoke to the maitre d, and he comped our uneaten entrees, to his credit. We tipped on the full amount, making it $30 for a salad, a few Safeway coldcuts, 5 Lucca tortellini apiece, and a $5.75(!)  bottled beer each. \n\nNormally I'd want to give them a break in this economy, where everyone is struggling. EXCEPT - the place was inexplicably packed. They are not suffering for clientele, so I wonder if they are just investing less in the food and service and increasing their margins.\n\nJust sad to see a great place lose its soul and its dignity.", "rating": 1, "date": "2011-06-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Ignore the crooked frames, because from the bread to the cheese tortellini, everything is melt in your mouth delicious.

I want it to be my little secret.\n\nI had out of town guests from Norway wanting to get Italian food. They wanted to get something at Fisherman's Wharf. My response to them was, tell me where you are, and I'll come pick you up and take you somewhere good. (i.e. not at Fisherman's Wharf)\n\nOriginally, I was going to go to Delfina, until I was told that it's a 4 week reservation wait for prime time spots. Screw that. My preference is always to go to places not packed. There's a myth that all the good places are packed. Certainly, lots of places are packed because they are good, but the packed places have no monopoly by any means.  There's plenty of diamond in the rough in this town, and La Traviata, being right by the 24th and Mission BART station on Mission no less, is certainly in the rough. After dining there, I can say, that it is certainly a diamond as well.\n\nWell, my Norwegian friends called me back, sounding a bit frazzled. \"There's lots of people riding on bikes, and everyone is crazy and shouting!\"  Then I realized, that today is Critical Mass, and there was no way in hell I was going to drive anywhere. Fortunately, they never made it to Fisherman's Wharf and was at the Embarcadero. Quick hop on the BART, and quickly walking past some raucous homeless people,  they were there before you could say Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nDuring and after the dinner, the consensus around the table was an enthusiastic thumbs up. Tortellini with white sauce, with red sauce, veal, chicken, spaghetti ai funghi, minestrone, carpaccio, Bruschetta, tiramisu, creme carmel, espresso, chianti classico.

He offered to add a side of angel hair pasta and marinara sauce on the side as insurance in case the veal was not up to the young man's standards. Smart man!

They are not as \"polished\" as the popular places, and sure they aren't the quickest, but, you don't go here for polish or to get a quick bite. You come here to sit, talk, laugh, enjoy the food, let the wine soak into your soul. When you are full is when you are full, when you leave is when you leave. My 10 year-old has not adopted my philosophy however, so he took the liberties of tracking down the waiter to hand him the card. Kids these days.

The restaurant is not in North Beach, no - it's in outer mission - not too far from the Foxy Lady Boutique (where your local hos likes to shop), across the street from La Taqueria (where your local hos like to dine), and a half block away from BART.  \n\nWow, this place took me back to little Italy in the Bronx, NY.  It is a hole in the wall, with pictures of old Opera singers covering every inch of wall space.  It is not like other Italian restaurants in San Francisco.  This place feels special.  They've been there for 35 years, so they've seen the neighborhood change, but you can tell they haven't changed much.  The food is soooo freekin good.  Melt in your mouth goodness, I tell you.  UH!  They serve until about 10pm on the weekdays.  Ruy was our server, and did a fabulous job, even gave us free flan at the end of our meal!!  So good. So good.

I mean HOT BREAD. The butter melts right into it. It's hard not to just scarf it all down. I maintained my discipline so I could eat the actual meal. I started with the Caesar salad, which I'm afraid to say was somewhat disappointing. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, but the dressing was anchovy overkill. I love me some anchovy-y Caesar dressing, but this was ridiculous. It was like anchovies pureed and poured over romaine. Not really my cup of tea. I couldn't even finish half of it.

Worst part is that the person serving us (which I assume is the owner) muttered under his breath that he knew the scallops were bad but thats just how they came out. I couldnt believe it, how they can knowingly serve terrible food??
