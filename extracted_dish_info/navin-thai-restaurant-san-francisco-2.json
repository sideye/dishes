His emphasis is on serving fresh food at a reasonable price.  I had the gang leang soup, peppery soup with pumpkin, zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, basil, and shrimp.  So delicious!  The spiciness did not overwhelm the other subtle flavors and the pumpkin added a creaminess that was excellent.  This soup is only $7.95 and can be a meal by itself.

I was on a road trip going through the coast to Los Angeles, and decided to stop in San Fran to do a little site seeing. I was tired of fast food and needed to put an actual meal besides burgers and fries in my system. This restaurant was small, and quite. Just the way I like it. Haha! Greeted by a young lady, and sat down in the booth near the window. I ordered the Golden Fried Rice, and Pad See Ew. It was good! Out of all the Pad See Ew's that I've had I'd give it a high 8. As I was eating my meal the Chef came out and waved at me and was checking if everything was alright. That made me smile because he was so cute about it. Haha! If I ever come back to San Fran, I'll most likely come back.
