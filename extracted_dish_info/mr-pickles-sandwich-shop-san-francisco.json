I took a glance at their menu and the Cesar Chavez and The Gaucho caught my attention.  I chose the Gaucho because the chicken comes marinated in my favorite sauce, Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  The sandwich consists of chicken marinated in Frank's sauce on a sourdough roll topped off with mayo, mustard, pesto, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and peperoncini.  The sandwich also comes with ranch dressing, but I'm not a fan of the dressing so I requested no ranch.  \n\nThe sandwich is a generous portion and comes nicely toasty.  The sourdough roll was tasty and crunchy and the sandwich exploded with flavor from the chicken to the sauce.  The sandwich was a little spicy because of the wing sauce but it was perfect in my opinion.  The crunch of the bread, the flavorful chicken, and the condiments all added for a tasty sub.  I had intentions of saving the other half for later, but I couldn't resist.  \n\nMy only complaint is the lady behind the counter, perhaps she's the owner?  She had the TV on and they were running a news story about the new Arizona immigration law and she made a coarse remark regarding illegal immigrants.

Salami, ham, mortadella, provolone cheese and italian dressing. Excellent on either the sourdough or dutch crunch.\n\n#19: Station 7 - Chicken breast marinated in honey mustard (Yes!) with pepper jack cheese and avocado on dutch crunch. Not sure how anyone can dislike this combination.\n\n#10: The Bear - For when I want to get messy. Hot roast beef with bbq sauce and melted cheddar cheese. Healthy serving of roast beef, that doesn't get overcooked in the process of heating. Tangy and sweet bbq sauce, with no spice at all (A spicy bbq sauce would be awesome here) but nonetheless a nice compliment to the roast beef and cheddar.\n\nBesides those big four, there's plenty of other delicious choices, as well as unlimited possibilities for your own custom supersandwich.\n\nNot the most attractive decor or layout but it works, as it simply wouldn't feel right if it were much classier. Service is usually great, but sometimes it can be on the slow side. They only accept cash, and more often than not the ATM is out of order, so you need to go across the street to the laundromat.

Besides making your own sandwich out of all the normal ingredients, the 31+ specialty sandwiches are innovative and robust. Along with fresh, (usually) flavorful meats and veggies, their sauces are savory and plentiful.\n\nSome Favorites-\n\n#13: Cesar Chavez - Seems to be everyone's favorite. Chicken breast, bacon, avocado and jack cheese on sourdough roll. Chicken is always tender, bacon is usually slightly chewy but sometimes nice and crispy, avocado is abundant, and the sourdough rolls are fresh and immense.\n\n#3: Tony Soprano - Great italian combination here. Salami, ham, mortadella, provolone cheese and italian dressing. Excellent on either the sourdough or dutch crunch.\n\n#19: Station 7 - Chicken breast marinated in honey mustard (Yes!) with pepper jack cheese and avocado on dutch crunch. Not sure how anyone can dislike this combination.\n\n#10: The Bear - For when I want to get messy. Hot roast beef with bbq sauce and melted cheddar cheese. Healthy serving of roast beef, that doesn't get overcooked in the process of heating. Tangy and sweet bbq sauce, with no spice at all (A spicy bbq sauce would be awesome here) but nonetheless a nice compliment to the roast beef and cheddar.\n\nBesides those big four, there's plenty of other delicious choices, as well as unlimited possibilities for your own custom supersandwich.\n\nNot the most attractive decor or layout but it works, as it simply wouldn't feel right if it were much classier. Service is usually great, but sometimes it can be on the slow side. They only accept cash, and more often than not the ATM is out of order, so you need to go across the street to the laundromat.

This was after already waiting over 20 mins after I placed my order. \n      \n      I asked why would it take that long? They said because it needs to be toasted for 3 mins. Well does it take 7 mins to finish it? Are they making everyone else's sandwiches before they get to mine? He then told me they can make a cold sandwich for me right away. I looked at the menu and all the sandwiches they make are all toasted except for 2 . It has a \"T\" next to sandwich on the menu to indicate that the sandwich is toasted. \n     \n      He was kind enough to refund my money and make the cold sandwich for free. I thought that was a nice gesture. I then ordered the House Combo. They make the sandwich right away and in just under 30 mins I finally had a sandwich and went on my way. When I got back to my office to eat since I had no time to eat there I saw that they gave me a sandwich with only cheese and a cucumber!!!! I can not begin to explain how pissed off I was when I saw that!!! \n\n      The only thing that I can come up with is that they had to have did that on purpose since I took them up on taking the free sandwich.

Along with fresh, (usually) flavorful meats and veggies, their sauces are savory and plentiful.\n\nSome Favorites-\n\n#13: Cesar Chavez - Seems to be everyone's favorite. Chicken breast, bacon, avocado and jack cheese on sourdough roll. Chicken is always tender, bacon is usually slightly chewy but sometimes nice and crispy, avocado is abundant, and the sourdough rolls are fresh and immense.\n\n#3: Tony Soprano - Great italian combination here. Salami, ham, mortadella, provolone cheese and italian dressing. Excellent on either the sourdough or dutch crunch.\n\n#19: Station 7 - Chicken breast marinated in honey mustard (Yes!) with pepper jack cheese and avocado on dutch crunch. Not sure how anyone can dislike this combination.\n\n#10: The Bear - For when I want to get messy. Hot roast beef with bbq sauce and melted cheddar cheese. Healthy serving of roast beef, that doesn't get overcooked in the process of heating. Tangy and sweet bbq sauce, with no spice at all (A spicy bbq sauce would be awesome here) but nonetheless a nice compliment to the roast beef and cheddar.\n\nBesides those big four, there's plenty of other delicious choices, as well as unlimited possibilities for your own custom supersandwich.\n\nNot the most attractive decor or layout but it works, as it simply wouldn't feel right if it were much classier.
