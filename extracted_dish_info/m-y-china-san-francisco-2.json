For starters, we ordered the Shiu Mai and Pork Juicy Dumplings. They were very tasty, and on par with the dumplings that you can find in Chinatown. We also ordered the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which was our favorite dish by far. I never had scissor cut noodles before, and I really liked the texture. I'm also a total sucker for anything with wild boar. The Sichuan Green Beans and Kung Pao Chicken dishes were fine, nothing super special. \n\nOverall, there are numerous places in Chinatown that I would prefer to eat at if I was craving any of these dishes, but it's a good option when you are in the downtown area.

Very comparable to xiaolongbao that I've had in Shanghai. You get five on their own individual ceramic spoons. It doesn't sound like much, but they are on the larger side. Unlike other soup dumplings where soup spills out when you break the skin, these hold their soup inside the meat filling so you get more and more in your spoon with each bite. \n\nWild boar sticky rice cakes $16- These were great! The rice cakes were wonderfully thick and chewy and taste homemade, the veggies fresh and bright.\n\nBeijing knife cut noodles $13- This is a play on zhajiangmein but doesn't taste anything like the real thing. The dish was still delicious in its own way, and I liked that they created a sauce with toppings that really suit the texture and shape of the noodles. \n\nEast meets west $12- Highly recommend!

The unclean floor is a major turn-off to me, though, because it does not fit the image that this restaurant tries so hard to portray.\n\nThe waiter brings--or is supposed to bring, if he/she turns out to be one of the distracted ones--water nicely bottled by the house, plus the customer has the option of getting complimentary sparkling water, which, I believe, is a big plus. Their portions are generous--any dish can be shared by two--which makes it, really, a not expensive restaurant. Their service inconsistent: sometimes fast and attentive, sometimes unprofessional--some waiters get distracted, some others are overly casual (remember: overly casual equals unprofessional and may mean something worse). The ambiance is pleasant, not that noisy, since the place has good acoustics--the ambiance noise in the restaurant doesn't get amplified, therefore one can always carry out a conversation, as crowded and busy as it always tends to be. \n\nMy favorite dish is the Forbidden Rice and my favorite cocktail drink is the East Meets West. Even though their noodles are home made, they do not impress me. However, their fresh teas are superb. And the desserts are exquisite!\n\nThe food is very clean and very fresh, for the most part.

He also had a side of Steamed Jasmine Rice, which was neither impressive nor disappointing; it was pretty standard rice.\n\nThroughout the meal, we both enjoyed the Milk Oolong tea which is sublime.

We were lucky enough to be able to grab an early reservation, but arrived before the restaurant opened, and therefore had to linger a while.  Each member of the staff was so busy bustling around getting the place ready for service, yet they all had time for a warm smile and/or a friendly greeting.  \n\nOnce seated, we were promptly greeted by our server and offered drinks, which we happily ordered.  My husband ordered an East Meets West...YUM.  I ordered an Under the Bronze Bell...a delightful prosecco cocktail.  Both were brought to the table quickly, along with the sodas my kids ordered.  \n\nWhile we sipped our cocktails and pondered the menu, we were entertained by the restaurants expert noodle pullers (not sure the industry term!) who pulled and snipped long noodles into huge pots of bubbling water in the action packed open kitchen.  Some guys were throwing noodles from a couple of feet away into the pots...it was like acrobatic noodle making.  Very fun to watch.\n\nWhen it was time to order food, our server was very helpful, as we wanted to order every single thing on the menu.  She was able to narrow things down for us...\n\nWe ordered:\n\nTea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders- DELICIOUS.  I would totally order these again.\n\nShandong Beef Rolls- We watched a little video of them being made before we went to the restaurant.  They did NOT disappoint!\n\nMu Shu Pork Tacos- Another delightful dish, highly recommended.\n\nBeef Hand Pulled Noodles\nBraised Beef Short Ribs in a Claypot- This is my only complaint of the entire evening, and it's a petty one....The above noodle dish and claypot dish were both ordered, and they were both delicious, but they are almost exactly the same flavor...the only difference really is that one is served over noodles.  Now I want to make it perfectly clear that both dishes were absolutely worth ordering, but there were so many other yummy looking things on the menu, I only wished we had chosen one of the beef dishes and then got something else.  I feel that the server should have given us a little heads up on the similarities thereby giving us the option to choose something else...\n\nM.Y. Sweet and Sour Pork:  Um....Best I've ever had in my entire San Francisco raised life...\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots- Very tasty but expensive.  Not sure if they are a really rare type of pea shoot or what, but a plate of them was $16 versus stir fried green beans (which we didn't try) at $8.  I'm guessing the price must be justifiable, I just forgot to ask what was special about them.  Next time though, I'd probably go for the green beans.\n\nMapo Organic Tofu- We ordered it extra spicy and it was delicious.  \n\nOverall, our experience was fantastic.

However, I do prefer The Chairman's pork belly bao, as it's a little cheaper and they give you larger pieces of meat. \n**Forbidden Rice ($8)**\nThis reminded me of wild rice; the dish includes different types of rice mixed with wolfberries, corn, and pineapple!

The No1DP had to buy some chocolate at the mall and one of the staff at that place suggested eating \"under the dome\". \n\nCONCEPT: A collaboration between Martin Yan (of Yan Can Cook, a staple resource for rice-cooker owners) and Ronny and Willy Ng, the owners of \"Koi Palace\" in Daly City. \n\nVENUE: One of the more \"formal\" sit-down dining options \"Under the Dome\", SF's premier dining area. There's indoor and \"outdoor\" seating. The No1DP and I chose to sit directly next to a \"open kitchen\" (it's actually partially sealed so less mess) so you can watch the cooking show in front of you.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow on a Friday afternoon, but we managed to get our drinks and entrees in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nNo1DP and I ate here prior to a movie so we primarily went with their happy hour menu.\n- Afternoon Zu (Zubrowka bison grass vodka, ginger liqueur, elderflower). A bit disappointed with this vodka because I had high standards for zubrowka, which is supposed to be high-quality polish vodka. It tasted like there were two conflicting \"herbal\" flavors in the drink.\n- Vesper (Vesper Gin, vodka, Cocchi Americano. Shaken, not stirred). Slightly better than the Afternoon Zu, but the flavoring was still slightly \"off\".\n- Buddha Breeze (Hangar One \"Buddha's hand\" vodka, thai basil & cucumber). Should have gotten this, his drink was mixed perfectly and tasted quite refreshing with a hint of tart.\n\n- Shui Mai (pork, shrimp, morel mushroom), $5. The shu mai is a bit more plump than typically served at dim sum. Each piece was dense with meat.\n- Har Gow (jumbo shrimp, served with spicy soy sauce), $5. Like the shu mai, the piece is more plump than typically served at dim sum. Had a slightly hard time picking it up with plastic chopstick. The skin easily came off from the shrimp. This is one of the pieces that goes well with chili and soy sauce - eating it plain tastes somewhat bland.\n- Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup (slow simmered short rib, baby bok choy), $15. The dish had excellent presentation. Bok choy was slightly firm (just right!) and moist and soft ribs that could be easily sliced with the fork. Although noodle quality is not like Shangdong handmade noodles (my gold standard), it tasted more \"doughey\" and doesn't absorb too much of the broth.\n\nIn retrospect, though the No1DP and I liked our experience here, this restaurant is more suited for real dinner.

Getting to see the cooks do their thing in the kitchen was also a nice addition to the overall experience.

The filling of the XLB were really nice and gingery which I enjoyed, but a majority of the bao's were already broken which was sad. They came in spoons which made the situation better, but still - a bummer!\n* Spicy Seafood Dumplings - Another favorite. The sauce was delicious and pulled everything together.

The shape of the noodles were not very symmetrical, but overall still good.\n* Shiu Mai & Har Gow - Both Dim Sum classics. Not bad, but not great. Overall nothing too special about these. \n* Lychee panna cotta - I'm half Italian and half Chinese, so this sounded interesting - like the best of both worlds! Unfortunately, it was kind of odd. Definitely not panna cotta at all, but more like pudding. Beautiful presentation, but I wouldn't bother getting this again.\n\n[Service]: Every employee we encountered, including the host, buser, runner, and of course server, was professional and kind. Our server checked in on us enough to make sure our water was full and that we doing okay overall, but never in a way that was bothersome or annoying which I appreciated. \n\nAll in all, I appreciate M.Y.

We also ordered the sweet and sour pork, this had large pieces of pork which had a thin coating (it's nice to have more meat than batter).\nOur orders were brought one at a time, which made it nice enjoy each dish before moving onto the next. \nThe only reason I subtracted a star is that I had to ask for soy sauce (the dishes come with a chili soy, it was good but not for everyone). If you order the tea be aware, the cups are very small. After two sips you have to pour more. Also, even though I told our waiter we had a person with shellfish alergies, I had to ask which orders of dim sum had the fish in them before eating.\nThe nice ending was our server comped our birthday dessert, the egg puffs.

DIM SUM COLLECTION - Shiu Mai (2), Steamed BBQ Pork Bao (1), "], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "\"If Yan can cook, so can you!\"\n\nEver since I was a kid, Martin Yan's signature line has been burned into my brain.  However, being limited to just watching his TV show, Yan could cook it but I could never try it.  That is, until he opened up his restaurant in the Westfield Center.  So, after my friend and I found our original lunch plans thrown for a loop and seeing nary a line outside M.Y. China, we decided to check them out!\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the space was really nice, but I especially liked how our seats at the counter allowed us to watch the kitchen do its thing (I'd recommend it for small parties).  As for the menu, it was pretty cool how there's a mix of both traditional and more modern versions of Chinese dishes.\n\n- WILD BOAR SCISSOR CUT NOODLES with Wood Ear Mushrooms, Scallions and Shaoxing Wine...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#PoUjuaiGxLPP0O-AEjOu9w)\nWhile it wasn't bad, the dish wasn't all that exciting.  I liked the consistency and texture of the noodles, but the flavor could have used more of the boar.\n\n- WILD BOAR JUICY DUMPLINGS (4) with Ginger, Garlic, and M.Y. Seasoned Salt.....$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#td64XEqqhnqR7uy2OPzGqQ)\nThe wild boar was much more successful here than in the noodle dish.  Each dumpling was decently filled and the meat was pretty juicy.  I wish there had been more soup in each one, but the dish was fine otherwise (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#QJuydsrQplssABvejnUB6w).\n\n- M.Y. DIM SUM COLLECTION - Shiu Mai (2), Steamed BBQ Pork Bao (1), Multi Grain Rice (1), Har Gow (2), Seafood Dumpling (2), and Mongolian Beef Bao (1)...$19\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#E0RSyIwF0AnlEHexFCq0oA)\nYes, we knew it was expensive for dim sum, but it allowed us to try several more items in one dish.  Overall, it was underwhelming.  The Shu Mai was actually pretty good and the Har Gow and Multi Grain Rice were okay.  The two baos were pretty \"meh\" though and I didn't care much for the Seafood Dumpling.\n\n- WOK SEARED BEEF FILET with Sichuan Peppercorns on a bed of Arugula...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#M1rnqAkCUOFl_f_VHfPGtg)\nEasily my favorite dish.  I feared the meat would be tough, but each piece was both tender and flavorful.  The beef combined really well with the arugula too.\n\nAs far as the prices go, it's undeniably higher here than at other Chinese restaurants in SF.  However, I'd be reluctant to say M.Y. China is \"overpriced\" since both the quality of the ingredients and the service are much better.  Plus, it's somewhat expected given the name above the door and their location (it is Union Square).\n\nMoney aside, the food itself was the bigger issue for me.  While the beef and dumpling dishes were good, the other two didn't do much for me.  Nothing bad mind you, but nothing amazing.

He also went on to explain to us that the kitchen staff needed to be able to communicate with each other about their work.  Fine, is shouting really necessary for the communication?  \n\nWe both knew Caucasian friends that are well versed in Chinese, some with greater eloquence than us.  This manager was obviously clueless about what is being bantered about in the open kitchen or he would not have offered his explanation.  He was also obviously a block head since he got all huffy when I told him he does not know what the hell was talking about.  He then got up within inches of my face and spoke directly into my ear and said in a threatening tone \"you should watch how you speak to me!\"  \n\nWhat?!?

Everything's been prepped earlier so no cutting on display, just lots of crazy hectic activity.\n\nThe menu is fairly long and varied for a fancy restaurant, but not for a Chinese place. You really don't have many choices. Each particular kind of noodle is served one way so if you want the hong kong fried noodles it's with chicken, the pulled noodles it's wild boar, the dumplings it's shrimp.\n\nA basic dish like pea shoots in garlic was done so well, perfectly cooked, perfect texture, it was for sure the best I'd had. Salt and pepper squid was nice texture, a great (but too thick for me) batter, and a very complex dipping sauce, it would have been better if they would include lemons without asking.

"], "author": "Carol A.", "review": "I was bummed that it wasn't a mind blowing experience for us. It's what a customer would naturally expect for paying such high prices for Chinese food in a town where we can easily find hundreds of great, authentic, Chinese restaurants (the best in the nation!). The food was prepared fine and tasted OK but it seemed to lack passion and creativity... Not even when it comes to garnishing. The outside looks upscale but effort says otherwise. More importantly it tasted like it lacked \"wok hay\". You'll have to Google that but only experienced chefs can get it right and it's difficult to define (but not difficult to identify when you taste the difference!) It is one of the most important attributes that Cantonese people look for in Chinese food. It's what gives food life and excitement. Merely being palatable is not enough.\n\nWe had Chairman Mao's Chicken, which I expected to be drenched in some kind of sauce but wasn't...just a basket of crispy breaded chicken pieces with dipping sauce. We didn't even get any veggies in ours just a basket of breaded chicken. (Come to think of it nothing we had came with veggies not even for looks). This was listed as an entree item not a side or appetizer so I was already disappointed with our main course. I felt mislead. We were going to have this over our white rice but it just didn't go well together texture wise. It's definitely not like walking into a traditional Chinese restaurant, ordering any main course and being able to co-mingle everything together over rice. More upsetting that I look online at another version of the M.Y. China menu and this item is listed as a \"bar item\" / small bites and not an entree. (And it was $9 not the $16 we paid). This is equivalent to a restaurant adding a few extra chicken wings to their appetizer and changing it to a dinner plate...sorry but whether it's 6 pieces or a dozen, it's still an appetizer.\n\nWe also had whole wheat potstickers which were yum, salt and pepper calamari which was mediocre (edible but had no pizzazz in terms of preparation and presentation), 2 bowls of white rice, Peking duck (very good fresh buns but stingy on the duck skin...which weren't crispy and hot either. All I tasted was bun and no skin), and mu shu pork tacos which I enjoyed because it was different though my husband did not like the combination. \n\nOverall we spent about $80 which easily could have gotten us a family style Chinese dinner for 6 elsewhere. I was really hoping to either find some really great authentic food or something off the wall different but M.Y. China doesn't quite achieve either of them. Though the food will suit American tastes just fine, it might not be the place to take your Chinese parents to but it made for a nice date night for us. Even got to watch the light show under the dome while we ate. My only regret is not trying the noodles as fresh pulled noodles have got to be pretty awesome.\n\nOne last thing worth mentioning was the service. I don't know what happened but it went from excellent service at the beginning of our meal to nosediving at the end. The table next to us had a different server from us...however we finished eating around the same time. Up until that point, we had extremely attentive servers who kept coming to check on us. Then they suddenly disappeared. Not for 10 minutes, but for over 30 minutes. It was so bad, that the table next to us had to get up and wander towards the back of the restaurant looking for their waiter so they could pay the bill. They were visibly upset and so were we. From what we could tell no one was able to help them in the back either (I'm assuming the server had the bill). We had to waive a busboy down to help us...who looked unsure how to help us, even asking if we wanted him to box our food or us to do it ourselves. When our server finally got back to us (we waived him down), he wasn't apologetic and maybe was oblivious to how long we were waiting. He never offered dessert or anything...which I probably would've liked to try.\n\nFinally, the bill....which came clamped inside a giant metal fortune cookie. As cute as it may be, I'm surprised by how no one knew this would be a bad idea..HELLO? a huge bill in a fortune cookie for the incredibly superstitious? 1. It's like handing someone a red envelope with a \"You Owe ME\" in it and  # 2. Can you say Cliche'? Fortune cookies are about as authentic to Chinese food as the Taco Bell chihuahua is to Mexican food. #3. What are you wishing on me as I'm about to leave your establishment?

It sounds like a boba drink but it's actually regular tea with the slightest hint of milk in it! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.\n- Shiu Mai: Meh. Tasted okay but nothing spectacular. Probably wouldn't get it unless you're a huge shu mai fan.\n- Har Gow: Tasted decent, but again, nothing too special. Although I really liked the sauce they provided with it. Had a little bit of a spicy kick.\n- BBQ Pork Buns: I think the meat was a tiny bit on the dry side but overall I liked the seasoning and the texture of the bao.\n- Egg Custard Bun: This was amazing. A tiny bit on the too sweet side but otherwise I loved it\n- Honey Walnut Shrimp: the portion size on this was a bit disappointing given it's price point but the taste was amazing. A lot of times the shrimp coating is really soggy because of the sauce but they managed to retain the crispyness of the coating this time. Probably the best honey walnut shrimp I had!\n- Wild Boar Noodles: Note, I have no idea what the meat was suppose to taste like so I can't really commentate on that but the noodles (which I believe are hand made) were so good! It was similar to udon noodles but not quite as soft and a little bit thicker, so definitely a must try if you like thick noodles.\n\nOverall, slightly more expensive lunch/dinner location but not too bad for FiDi.

I read through all the Yelp reviews (especially from the Asians, sorry I am unapologetically biased here), and figured it was worth a shot since I didn't want to trek all the way to the Richmond -- my typical go to neighborhood for authentic Chinese eats.\n\nBut surprisingly, M.Y. China is pretty darn good. Like, I would return and even take my parents there good. I read up on what dishes were the favorites, and Yelpers didn't let me down. And I was pleasantly surprised to see a decent number of Asians eating at the restaurant too. But with the fully English-speaking waiter, they definitely are able to cater to the tourist/office/Westernized crowd as well. Let's just say I didn't place any of my orders in Mandarin.\n\nHere's what we chowed down on:\n* Wild boar scissor cut noodles: believe the hype, this noodle dish is legit. the perfect chewiness (QQ) to the noodles, good flavoring. Could it have done with more boar? yes, but that's not the point of this dish. \n* crab and pork soup dumpling: I love me some XLB. I was slightly disappointed by these -- loved the presentation but the skin stuck to the big red soup spoons and the meat filling wasn't as tender as I'm used to. the skin was thin, which was a plus, but I just expected more. \n* seafood dumplings: these come in a garlicky, slightly spicy sauce and were a delicious variation of your typical har gow/shrimp dumpling. I would get these again. \n* Peking duck: a solid dish. Their mantou steamed buns were perfectly light and fluffy and the duck skin nice and crispy. The duck meat was well seasoned and while a tad on the dry side, still well excuted. \n* Sauteed snow peas: dou miao is a go to for me, and this was executed fine. nothing mind blowing but just a standard garlic saute version. \n* Sauteed green beans: again, fine. a bit soggy but flavor was good. \n\nBy the end of the meal, there was nothing left between the three of us. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal there and I would be happy to go back for another meal.

So, after my friend and I found our original lunch plans thrown for a loop and seeing nary a line outside M.Y. China, we decided to check them out!\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the space was really nice, but I especially liked how our seats at the counter allowed us to watch the kitchen do its thing (I'd recommend it for small parties).  As for the menu, it was pretty cool how there's a mix of both traditional and more modern versions of Chinese dishes.\n\n- WILD BOAR SCISSOR CUT NOODLES with Wood Ear Mushrooms, Scallions and Shaoxing Wine...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#PoUjuaiGxLPP0O-AEjOu9w)\nWhile it wasn't bad, the dish wasn't all that exciting.

Seasoned Salt.....$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#td64XEqqhnqR7uy2OPzGqQ)\nThe wild boar was much more successful here than in the noodle dish.  Each dumpling was decently filled and the meat was pretty juicy.  I wish there had been more soup in each one, but the dish was fine otherwise (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#QJuydsrQplssABvejnUB6w).\n\n- M.Y.

Overall, it was underwhelming.  The Shu Mai was actually pretty good and the Har Gow and Multi Grain Rice were okay.  The two baos were pretty \"meh\" though and I didn't care much for the Seafood Dumpling.\n\n- WOK SEARED BEEF FILET with Sichuan Peppercorns on a bed of Arugula...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#M1rnqAkCUOFl_f_VHfPGtg)\nEasily my favorite dish.  I feared the meat would be tough, but each piece was both tender and flavorful.  The beef combined really well with the arugula too.\n\nAs far as the prices go, it's undeniably higher here than at other Chinese restaurants in SF.  However, I'd be reluctant to say M.Y. China is \"overpriced\" since both the quality of the ingredients and the service are much better.  Plus, it's somewhat expected given the name above the door and their location (it is Union Square).\n\nMoney aside, the food itself was the bigger issue for me.

This place is definitely an upscale Chinese place, and the food is kind of expensive for the amount of food and the quality of it, maybe because I'm used to going to cheaper Chinese restaurants   around the city with my family where I get more bang for my buck, but I digress. This place has a mix of dim sum and Chinese dishes, and the wait for our food wasn't long, around 10-15 min. \n\nFood:\n\n- Har gow (3): The har gow comes with some soy sauce (I didn't try the sauce since I don't usually eat har gow with sauce, but the har gow was packed with shrimp inside, and was definitely my favorite out of all the dishes.\n\n- Pork juicy dumplings (5): This is basically xiao long bao, and it was delicious. It comes in little individual spoons and comes with the usual vinegar sauce. There was also a slice of cucumber in between the spoon and dumpling, which was interesting but it didn't enhance the flavor of the dumpling or anything, so maybe it was there for aesthetic purposes or something, but still delicious, nonetheless. \n\n- Kung pao chicken: This is actually the first time I've had kung pao chicken, and it was alright. The dish comes with chicken (which were kind of dry), bell peppers (which were delicious), some chili peppers (which my friends said weren't spicy, but since I'm a weakling with spicy food, it was a bit spicy for me), and peanuts (very delicious!!). This dish had good flavor and spiciness.\n\n- Yang zhou fried rice: The amount of food was kind of small for the price, and it comes with mushrooms, BBQ pork, and shrimp pieces. The rice was good, but a little bland, and it worked well with the other dishes.\n\nThe service was great, and the servers refilled our waters when it was getting low in our glasses.

I'm glad I ordered this!\n\nWe also shared the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles and Pork Juicy Dumplings for everyone around the table.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles -- http://bit.ly/2itcleY\nbean sprouts, scallions, wood ear mushrooms\nThis is one of M.Y. China's signature menu items.  I liked the imperfection of the noodles and they were cooked perfectly with a good chew and the wild boar and mushrooms gave it a more hearty substance.\n\nPork Juicy Dumplings -- http://bit.ly/2itgi38\nBasically Xiao Long Bao and they were delicious!  A little pricey though compared to other places where you can get XLB.\n\nAnd then for Dessert I finished with the Lychee Panna Cotta.\n\nLychee Panna Cotta -- http://bit.ly/2it3DNR\nchrysanthemum granita, mint essence\nThis dessert was AMAZING!!  I love Panna Cotta and I love lychee so putting the two together made for a very delightful dessert!\n\nOverall, I liked M.Y. China.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be and it's a great spot to  dine for any occasion whether it be for a big party or if you're just stopping by for a quick noodle lunch.  I would definitely return again to try more of their menu items which there were plenty of.

It's is so centrally located that if you want to shop or watch a movie or theatre show or have an appointment at a certain time then this could be the option for you! This is the second time I have been to M.Y. China and I can honestly say I always want to go back for more! Now this is one of the higher end and some would say pricier options on the gourmet Chinese scale, but with recent San Francisco high profile additions like Hakkasan and Crystal Jade making waves and Din Tai Fung coming soon, I would have to say that M.Y China is one of the more pleasant surprises in the city.\n\nThe place is not perfect, but I have to admit the location, the overall food, and decent service was more than good enough to make this a must eat destination for any lover of high end Chinese cuisine. Whether you're taking family of friends, M.Y. China is one of the better San Francisco destinations, in a mall of course.\n\nMy friend and I got there at about 6pm on a Tuesday evening with an immediate appointment to see a movie at the AMC Metreon movie theatre across the street, so we knew we had to be out by 6:45pm in order to make our show. After being sat in the lovely open air area underneath the mall's dome, our server Oulu noticed our anxiety about timing and asked if we were in a rush. We said we were and immediately asked for recommendations. My friend really wanted M.Y. China's noteworthy hand pulled noodles but neither of us wanted soup. Oulu our server recommended the Da Dao \"Big Knife\" Fish Noodles which was served with shrimp, scallops, calamari, skitaki, enoki, jalapenos and XO sauce, as that was the only wok fried dish on the menu at M.Y. China that had the pulled noodles that didn't come with an additional charge. We then both wanted to try their Xiao Long Baos, otherwise known as their water dumplings. Oulu recommended we get the Juicy Dumplings in which you get 6 dumplings, (3 each of pork and pork and crab roe).\n\nOur meal came out in no time flat with plenty of time to enjoy the ambiance and the food while under the dome. Out first came the Da Dao \"Big Knife\" Fish Noodles which were tasty and piping hot with plenty of seafood and long long noodles. We had to ask for our traditional Chinese hot chili oil and paste to jazz up our meal. But I found the dish to be quite the delicious surprise, a bit on the greasy side, but that's to be expected with a wok fired dish. The real star was when the 6 Juicy Dumplings came out in a huge bamboo basket. Although they were very hot temperature wise, we had to blow on our customary soup spoon even after we doused the dumplings with red vinegar. The dumplings do stick to the spoon, which I expected with that much steam and warmth, and you had to break them into two pieces as bite into them. We found both found these dumplings filled with flavor and on the better side of the few dumplings I've had in the Bay Area.\n\nM.Y China was a great place for us to come to when you are in a rush and need to get a good meal in a bit of a rush. We finished our meal in under forty minutes! The food was unique and all-around delicious. The prices are not cheap but you do get what you pay for while you are here. (Our bill came about 38 dollars for just those two dishes.) This was my second time coming and now I want to return for a third time to try even more of their numerous noodle dishes and other small bites that M.Y China has to offer, including their Happy Hour! If you are looking for a good place to go to in downtown's Westfield San Francisco Centre, then M.Y.

We just finished a modest lunch at Super Duper Burgers a little over an hour ago so we certainly weren't hungry. However, we decided to go in just for a quick bite of dessert. We ended staying 3 hours. Our only excuse is we had just seen the 3rd Hobbit movie at the Metreon. In the spirit of Bilbo and hobbits everywhere, we ended up having a second lunch. \n\nWe ordered juicy dumplings and half a Peking roast duck. The dumplings were certainly juicy. The skins were very thin and delicate. We enjoyed the all pork filling more than the pork and crab roe combination but both kinds were delicious.\n\nThe duck served was just the breast meat. The fat was properly rendered leaving the meat moist without being greasy. The crackling skin was crispy and a delight to consume. At $20 we first thought it was expensive for just half a duck but because the duck was boneless and very meaty, we were able to consume the whole thing without any waste. It was a very good deal.\n\nFor libations, we ordered a mai tai and a Stella Artois cider. The mai tai was yummy and very well made. The cider was smooth and complemented the duck beautifully.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the sugar puffs or Chinese donuts and the black sesame ice cream. The donuts were warm and came with chocolate sauce, raspberry coulis and sweetened whipped cream. The ice cream was delicious and the flavor was a nice change from the ubiquitous green tea. Both desserts were yummy. We loved the thick, rich chocolate sauce but the best thing was when we stuffed the donut with the ice cream.  \n\nThe food was very good, not transcendent, but very good. What put M.Y. China over the top was the kitchen staff. We were seated at the chef's table. It is a counter facing the wok station of the open kitchen. Now I don't like sitting with my back to a room. I don't know, maybe I was a gangster or gunslinger in another life. My initial wariness quickly gave way to delight as we watched the busy cooks chop, fry and assemble food for the restaurant. \n\nWatching the food being prepared was actually what persuaded us to order more than dessert. We saw a fresh duck being pulled from the fryer. The golden, glistening skin just seduced us. The cook was also good at theater. We really couldn't carry on a conversation because the place is really noisy, but he really made a production of cutting and plating up that duck when he saw us watching him. Well after that private cooking demo, we just had to order that canard.\n\nThat same station prepped our dessert. By this time, we had been there for so long that a second cook had taken over the spot. We established a rapport and jokingly told him that while the donuts were delicious, serving 5 pieces really wasn't any good because it left an odd donut out. How would we divide this dessert fairly? The next thing we know, we were served a single donut stuffed with strawberry ice cream. \n\nGood companionship, great conversation, delicious food and engaging kitchen staff made this an awesome dining experience. The $$$$ bill didn't even phase us. (Well it did, we only realized afterwards that we could have save some bills by ordering from the happy hour menu.)

He asked if we were up for Chinese, and of course like anyone we gladly accepted. I was very surprised at the location. It was located on the fourth floor of the downtown Westfield Mall that were also surrounded by other restaurants. I first stepped in the restaurant  I noticed the decor; it was a more classy type of setting. The restaurant was had a nice and vibrant ambience, to it. It had its Chinese influence on the decor, of course but it still had a nice modern feel to it. It was brightly lit but then it was off set by the darker shades of the tables and the chair. Overall, I do really like the aesthetic of the restaurant because it is very pleasing to see. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. \n\n Spicy Seafood Dumplings (9)\n      This was actually the section of the menu that caught my eye since usually Dim Sum is not served during dinner. One of the menu items that we decided to order were the Spicy Seafood Dumplings. The dumpling wrapper is made out of spinach that stuffed with scallop and shrimp. The sauce was light and it did add more flavor to the dumplings. Although, I would add just a touch of more seasoning on the sauce. The spinach wrapper had a great texture since it still had a little bit of chew to it. On the inside, the scallop and shrimp were very tender and I liked the fact that it wasn't overcooked. The seasoning in the dumpling was perfect. If they did more, I felt that it would overwhelm the dish and destroy the delicacy and daintiness of the dish. I would definitely order this dish again.\n\n Juicy Dumplings w/ Pork or Pork & Crab Roe - (9)\nThe other item that we ordered off the Dim Sum menu was the Juicy Dumplings with Pork or Pork & Crab Roe. You had the choice  of either getting three with pork and three with pork & crab roe. We decided to get three of each. When it arrived, we opened and I really loved the simple but traditional presentation of the Juicy Dumplings. It was my first time trying this type of dumplings that had soup inside, so I was very excited to try this! I only tried one which was the one with pork. I enjoyed the fact that its own spoons so you really could savor the soup and all its deliciousness once when the dumpling breaks.  The pork had a really nice flavor to it. After that I drank the soup, and it had a sweet note to it from the combination of the pork and other seasonings. I really liked the dumpling because of all the savory flavors and the hint of sweetness to it. The whole dish itself was mouth watering!\n\nSeven Spice Pork Rib (18)\n   The first this dish that we ordered from the Wok Section was the Seven Spiced Pork Ribs. The presentation was already stunning, the  medley of colors from the scallions, onions, and herbs. Also, the Seven Spice that was set on top of this meat made it already mouth watering. When I first bit into it, my taste buds were already doing the salsa since the spices were so delicious! If you eat with all of the topping of the spices and the vegetables, it is very flavorful. Although, if you eat the meat itself it is kinda of dry and tough. I wish the rib was cooked down more. That would be the only thing that I would change about it. I would rate this dish a four out of five.\n\n Wok Seared Beef- (19)\n   This dish was actually recommended by a family member that has eaten here numerous times, so therefore I was ecstatic to try it. In the menu, it describes that it is seasoned with Sichuan peppercorns and laid on a bed of arugula. When I first bit into it, the meat was already so tender, that I just had to eat over and over again. The Sichuan peppercorns were just beautifully paired with the meat. It gave an extra something to the dish which I have been looking for while eating here. I loved this dish so much!\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp-(22)\n      One of my favorite dishes is the Honey Walnut shrimp. To see that now it is on the menu, I wanted to order it. It arrived and it looked like your typical honey walnut shrimp. I really enjoyed the glaze since it was sweet, but it had a twist to it. There were hints of wasabi, which provided it be kind of light. Also, it had the some fresh cucumbers with it which provided another dimension to it. I really liked the fact that they added wasabi since it was just something then ordinary.\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodles w/ Chicken X- (16) \nThis was my favorite dish since it had the right balance of flavors. At first it seemed like your typical crispy noodle dish, but then once it enters your mouth it is excellent. The crunchy part of noodles was just right and it wasn't too hard or too soft. Once you mix it in with the rich, and creamy sauce the noodles start to soften, and it just become delectable. The vegetables were not mushy and they still had a nice crunch to it. Also, the chicken was very moist and juicy. I just kept going back to the dish more and more.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with the Pork & crab roe juicy dumplings.

After the Hakkasan experience, my expectations were tempered; however, there were some expecttations after reading Genevieve's early review and photos.  Coincidentally, Michael Bauer recently wrote a review which I read earlier that week. Here's what we had:\n\nWealth menu - $88.00 for two people\n\n1) Juicy Dumplings Sampler (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VedCBrcp6hZ32dWUI2PNkA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Two each of Wild boar, pork and crab, and pork with black truffle.

The 'bird nest's basket' was my favorite aspect of this dish.\n\n4) Stir-fried Longevity Noodle with Shredded BBQ Pork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Rp8jAoGmkh1D0H-f3g5Bg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Good wok breath, but the flavors did not really wow.\n\nDessert\n5) Sugar Puff with sauces (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wowD-sWh0VqChon4tAgeQg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Think Beignets with chocolate and raspberry sauce.\n\nShared - Supplement\n\n1) Roasted chicken, half order (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1TQqleBP3HpcqtgXsHac-g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Mentioned in the newspaper review, this dish caught my cousin's eye and did not disappoint.\n\n2) Scissor cut noodles with Wild boar (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aPOSmbGf1URMz4We6M3Ctw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Better flavors than the Longevity noodle and the uneven cuts of the noodle confirm that they are freshly made.\n\nOverall, the meal was pretty good, as my father complimented the kitchen for its cooking skills on most of the dishes; shortly after this, the noodle person popped up behind him and started pulling noodles.  Our waitress was very accommodating to our needs, starting with our party reduction and the servers announced each dish as they brought them out and quickly cleared the empty dishes from our table.  The atmosphere is very interesting as you can get probably four different vibes dining here, depending where you are seated.  Besides where we sat, there are three other dining rooms, one with a series of communal tables next to the open kitchen with several counter seats, a more secluded, quiet dining to the left with a display wall decorated with various Buddha statues (for those who grew up in Chinatown, this reminds me of the original Imperial Palace, the Grant Avenue restaurant with the doorman), and the bar to the far right, adorned with a large bell.  Our table gave more a mall atmosphere with nearby outer tables and high ceiling atrium feel.  Coming in later that week for lunch, we sat near the open kitchen which gave more of a cafeteria vibe.  \nFor mall food, this is a bit over-the-top, but guess that's consistent with the San Francisco dining scene these days.  Yes, I came back for lunch (beef noodle soup being the last sampling - broth a bit on the sweet side, too much star anise or cinnamon?) and, yes, I will be back again when friends or family have a craving for Chinese food near my office.\nThanks to my brother for welcoming the Year of the Snake!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Will definitely come back here for Wild Boar Juicy Dumplings, Beef hand pulled noodles, and Crispy Chicken. \n", "-Ambience was good.\n", "-Service was a little disappointing.

We sat right in front of the kitchen's giant glass window, and head chef Tony (and others) smiled and waved several times at us during the meal. SO much fun!!\n\nWe ordered the \"Wealth\" menu, because it just seemed like such a better deal than the less expensive \"Prosperity\" one. I, for one, am over shiu mais and har gows after eating them at dimsum for 11 years in LA. And the Green pepper ribeye and XO chicken crispy noodle also seemed too common for such an occasion. Anyway, on to the food we did eat!\n\nJuicy Dumplings Sampler - WOW. Absolutely 5 stars for taste, presentation, the whole shebang.

I can't decide which is my favorite - crab or wild boar. The pork with black truffle was good but too heavy for me, but it was my friend's favorite.\n\nPeking duck in lettuce cups - The meat is supposed to be juicy stir-fried, not dried out and have the texture of crunchy jerky meat. It was like they had a pile that stayed heated (hence dried out) somewhere and just sprinkled them in for each order. The crispy noodle bed was nice, not greasy tasting, but a bit too much padding and made it very difficult to eat neatly. I have never spilled stuff out of a lettuce cup before this one!\n\nSeafood Treasury - Shrimps, scallops, etc. in a bird's nest. It looked great, as bird's nests usually do. The flavors were OK, just nothing too exciting. The server did bring us this awesome chili paste that went really well with the dish. Also, my friend previously hated scallops, but after trying this dish, she has discovered that she really likes them. We think she just had one that was really not fresh...\n\nStir-fried Longevity Noodle w/ Shredded BBQ Pork - By the name, I was expecting the hand-pulled super long noodles that MY China is famous for...or at the very least the \"yi mien\" that are served at Chinese birthday dinner banquets. Imagine my shock when a bowl of UDON came out!! I almost had to ask if we got the right food. Granted, the dish was actually good and really great with the chili. But...what the hell? And the Udon noodles weren't even that long!!!\n\n**Update: Heather responded saying the noodles were indeed hand-pulled (see her reply below), but the server who brought out the dish was the one who called it \"Stir-fry pork udon\". \n\nPeking duck skin in sliders - I wonder if they messed up the order of the food (as listed on the menu it's the 2nd item), or if this was actually intended to come out last. I'm not sure whether I liked the duck already in steamed buns with cucumber and green onions, but they sure looked pretty! The skin wasn't crispy enough, and I think being served in buns was the main reason. It tasted good, no shortage of duck meat. But my friend is sensitive to fattiness, and had to spit out entire chunks of fat while eating. She still really liked them though.\n\nSugar Puff w/ Sauces - The puffs are huge, airy, and full of awesome. We even got an extra thrown in for free! The sauces are raspberry, chocolate fudge, and creme fraiche. Not a huge fan of the first 2, since raspberry anything is usually sour (probably would've loved the strawberry one if they had it) and chocolate too sweet/heavy. But a tiny bit of either/both and a chunk of creme on the puff? MMM!!!\n\nOverall service was great. My friend even said it was the BEST service she ever had at a restaurant, and actually tipped a non-embarrassing amount!! (She's a very stingy tipper.........Yeah, I don't eat with her very often. Sigh.) \n\nThe highlight of the evening was of course meeting Martin Yan, who was extremely friendly and came by our table at least 3 times. When we were getting the check, near closing time, Martin strode into the kitchen. He and Tony put on a giant show waving woks around, making huge fires, and just generally being awesome. We were SO happy we stayed and caught that!!! \n\nAs it turned out, my friend also watched Yan Can Cook shows years ago with her daughter...like I did with my mother while living in Hong Kong! I hadn't told her M.Y. China was owned by Martin, so it was pretty much the best surprise ever (just wish it was her birthday LOL)!! She's telling everyone about the experience, and has her heart set on coming back next time Martin is in the house.

Major sad face because why is hair usually found in food AFTER most of it is consumed? Well at least it has been in my experience.  We called a manager over and showed him.  His face immediately turned grim and sullen, he took away the remainder of the dish and left promptly.  We saw him talking to one of the kitchen workers; one of the perks of an open kitchen, we customers can see most of what's going on. He came back to our table and told us he ordered another 3 pork and black truffle dumplings on the house for us.

"], "author": "Aleia P.", "review": "It was a first night in San Francisco, and one of our family friends invited us for dinner. He asked if we were up for Chinese, and of course like anyone we gladly accepted. I was very surprised at the location. It was located on the fourth floor of the downtown Westfield Mall that were also surrounded by other restaurants. I first stepped in the restaurant  I noticed the decor; it was a more classy type of setting. The restaurant was had a nice and vibrant ambience, to it. It had its Chinese influence on the decor, of course but it still had a nice modern feel to it. It was brightly lit but then it was off set by the darker shades of the tables and the chair. Overall, I do really like the aesthetic of the restaurant because it is very pleasing to see. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. \n\n Spicy Seafood Dumplings (9)\n      This was actually the section of the menu that caught my eye since usually Dim Sum is not served during dinner. One of the menu items that we decided to order were the Spicy Seafood Dumplings. The dumpling wrapper is made out of spinach that stuffed with scallop and shrimp. The sauce was light and it did add more flavor to the dumplings. Although, I would add just a touch of more seasoning on the sauce. The spinach wrapper had a great texture since it still had a little bit of chew to it. On the inside, the scallop and shrimp were very tender and I liked the fact that it wasn't overcooked. The seasoning in the dumpling was perfect. If they did more, I felt that it would overwhelm the dish and destroy the delicacy and daintiness of the dish. I would definitely order this dish again.\n\n Juicy Dumplings w/ Pork or Pork & Crab Roe - (9)\nThe other item that we ordered off the Dim Sum menu was the Juicy Dumplings with Pork or Pork & Crab Roe. You had the choice  of either getting three with pork and three with pork & crab roe. We decided to get three of each. When it arrived, we opened and I really loved the simple but traditional presentation of the Juicy Dumplings. It was my first time trying this type of dumplings that had soup inside, so I was very excited to try this! I only tried one which was the one with pork. I enjoyed the fact that its own spoons so you really could savor the soup and all its deliciousness once when the dumpling breaks.  The pork had a really nice flavor to it. After that I drank the soup, and it had a sweet note to it from the combination of the pork and other seasonings. I really liked the dumpling because of all the savory flavors and the hint of sweetness to it. The whole dish itself was mouth watering!\n\nSeven Spice Pork Rib (18)\n   The first this dish that we ordered from the Wok Section was the Seven Spiced Pork Ribs. The presentation was already stunning, the  medley of colors from the scallions, onions, and herbs. Also, the Seven Spice that was set on top of this meat made it already mouth watering. When I first bit into it, my taste buds were already doing the salsa since the spices were so delicious! If you eat with all of the topping of the spices and the vegetables, it is very flavorful. Although, if you eat the meat itself it is kinda of dry and tough. I wish the rib was cooked down more. That would be the only thing that I would change about it. I would rate this dish a four out of five.\n\n Wok Seared Beef- (19)\n   This dish was actually recommended by a family member that has eaten here numerous times, so therefore I was ecstatic to try it. In the menu, it describes that it is seasoned with Sichuan peppercorns and laid on a bed of arugula. When I first bit into it, the meat was already so tender, that I just had to eat over and over again. The Sichuan peppercorns were just beautifully paired with the meat. It gave an extra something to the dish which I have been looking for while eating here. I loved this dish so much!\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp-(22)\n      One of my favorite dishes is the Honey Walnut shrimp. To see that now it is on the menu, I wanted to order it. It arrived and it looked like your typical honey walnut shrimp. I really enjoyed the glaze since it was sweet, but it had a twist to it. There were hints of wasabi, which provided it be kind of light. Also, it had the some fresh cucumbers with it which provided another dimension to it. I really liked the fact that they added wasabi since it was just something then ordinary.\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodles w/ Chicken X- (16) \nThis was my favorite dish since it had the right balance of flavors. At first it seemed like your typical crispy noodle dish, but then once it enters your mouth it is excellent. The crunchy part of noodles was just right and it wasn't too hard or too soft. Once you mix it in with the rich, and creamy sauce the noodles start to soften, and it just become delectable. The vegetables were not mushy and they still had a nice crunch to it. Also, the chicken was very moist and juicy. I just kept going back to the dish more and more.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered spicy seafood dumplings, salt & pepper lobster, scallop fried rice, fish noodles and chairman mao's chicken.

Great combination of flavors, again nice sized portion.  Finally, the shandong beef rolls were incredible, one of the best small dishes I ever had.

It was not bad but really nothing tasty and I often get better roast pork at strip mall Chinese restaurants (this was probably higher quality meat the taste was not superior).  The biggest disappointment, though, and what almost knocked it down to three stars, was the sizzling pan fried savory pork bao.  I love pork buns but these were almost inedible.  They looked great but were primarily dough.

China on the 2014 Bib Gourmand list gave me the idea to finally stop by here and see what's the buzz all about.\n\nI came here with two others, we decided to just order our own plates and perhaps share some appetizers or dimsum. My biggest expectation was double what you would pay for in Chinatown and half the size of what they serve in Chinatown. It's very tough for me to try westernized Chinese food, just for the fact that there could be so many wrongs coming out of these places. Sometimes either fusion screws up a traditional dish, lacking certain flavors (especially spiciness), but sometimes it works pretty well in terms of food presentation.\n\nSo we ordered beef stew hand pulled noodles, spicy seafood dumplings, and HK style pan fried noodles.  (ERMAGGERD, NOODERS!)  The hand pulled noodles was alright. Portions were pretty good, reminded me of Noodle Asia in Venetian. The hand pulled noodles were okay, but I liked the ones from Imperial Tea Court in Berkeley more for that chewiness in the noodles. The soup base wasn't overly empowered by MSG and salt, one of the few times where I drank the whole thing.  What I enjoyed most was the beef, good quality beef and slow cooked to the right time. You don't have to gnaw on the beef chunks like you are a cow eating grass. It's actually very soft and falls apart inside your mouth.  \n\nI personally hate pan fried noodles because the dish is too indecisive on its texture. It's either too soggy from soaking in the sauce, or too crunchy because the noodles were burnt. I didn't recall seeing burnt noodles. I only tasted the sauce, which was slightly sweetened, as if it used chicken stock for base. The chicken pieces used surprised me a bit; I guess I was too used to eating chicken covered in thick batter before frying, I didn't expect to get to the meat so quickly. \n\nThe spicy dumplings were just okay. I was expected the dumpling skin to be more chewy. It's definitely pretty thin and it doesn't break when it's being picked up. Again, I'm not used to eating a big chunk of shrimp in the dumpling. The sauce was a bit overwhelming in the saltiness and there's no depth in the flavors.  Probably not going to order this next time.\n\nI guess if you want to try this place but got scared by the pricing. Look, you pay for what you get, you pay more for your dimsum, you get a bigger piece of shrimp!

(; With such low expectations, I was definitely in for a pleasant surprise (especially after finding out M.Y. stood for Martin Yan)!\n\nThis is not your typical hole-in-the-wall, bad-service Chinese restaurant. In fact, far from it! Upon entering through the front, one of their hosts greeted me by my name when I told him that I was meeting two former colleagues for dinner and then he proceeded to escort me to the table. My immediate thought was: 'Whoa! What just happened here?! What kind of Chinese restaurant is this?!' \n\nAs we walked through the restaurant, the second most striking difference was their d\u00e9cor; it was sleek and modern yet elegant and tactful. Not only was each table covered with white, fancy-looking linens, but each table was also decorated with classy dinnerware. Needless to say, I was impressed by their exceptional customer service and decor, especially since I'm so used to the negligent customer service I receive from most Asian restaurants.\n\nThough the menu is reminiscent of your typical Chinese restaurant, it won't come out looking like your ordinary Chinese food.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish! It's absolutely delicious.\n\n(Note: When they presented us with this dish we were confused and thought they had given us the wrong dish because we were expecting to see long noodle strands. So, imagine our surprise when we saw short, dark, doughy-looking pieces of something that looked really foreign to us. Yes, those foreign things are in fact the squid ink noodles.)\n\n+Stir Fried Green Beans: These crunchy green beans are saut\u00e9ed in a light, somewhat spicy sauce, and are a wonderful complement to the entr\u00e9e dishes we ordered.\n+Kung Pao Chicken: This dish includes a combination of stir-fried chicken, jalape\u00f1o, peanuts, and crunchy red dried peppers. The crunchy red dried peppers will surprise you!\n+Forbidden Rice: This is a combination of red rice, brown rice, barley, and wolfberries. With so much flavor and texture packed in this rice dish, it certainly didn't taste like my usual, healthy brown rice dish. Definitely a nice addition to the other dishes!\n+Sugar Egg Puffs: Four huge egg puffs filled with a custard cream filling served with three different kinds of sauces, including dark chocolate, vanilla bean Chantilly cr\u00e8me, and raspberry coulis. It tasted delicious with or without the sauce.\n\nI must admit that the portions are much smaller than what I had expected, especially for the price we were charged.

It's not the best Peking duck but it is still good and satisfies the craving. \n\nFrom the small eats, the tea smoked pork belly sliders are wonderful. They are tender and goes nicely with the bun.

It really is a pleasant looking restaurant and the aesthetics of the open-ish kitchen are also nice as you walk in. The hostess led us to a less-than-desirable table by the hallway to the bathroom (yes, we did have reservations for 4 through OpenTable), and upon asking to be re-seated at a number of other open tables were told they were all also \"reserved\". Not a big deal but more on this later (you can probably guess what happened). \n\nThe service to start was prompt, and the waitress seemed personable and took our orders. We elected to go with 2 Hot & Sour Soups, 2 Westlake Wonton Soups, the Beijing Beef Cut Noodles, Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, Pork Sliders, Chairman Mao's Chicken, and Wok Seared Beef Filet. The first red flag should have been when our waitress took our order mentally, and then returned a minute later to double-check which entree our friends had ordered (there's a reason why servers write it down)\n\nThe soups came out quickly, litteraly about 2 minutes after the waitress \"confirmed\" our order- I got the Hot & Sour, which I am a huge fan of at 99% of Chinese restaurants. Not this one. At first glance I would tell something was wrong... the soup wasn't of its traditional brown hue but concentrated very heavily with a vibrant red. One taste of the soup told me enough- it tasted like a thick paste mixed with Sriracha. Literally inedible and probably the worst thing I've tasted in a long, long time. I alerted our waitress to send the soup back (either this is the worst recipe on the planet or the chef of the night dumped way too much hot sauce into the soup) and request a bowl of the Westlake instead. She snatched the bowl off the table like I had personally offended her, and stormed off to the kitchen. She then disappeared for no-less than 15 minutes and forced us to ask two other different servers where our soup was (\"Coming right out\"). The replacement bowl of the Wonton soup made it out, followed 30 seconds later by our noodles and entrees. Great. \n\nThe soup itself- bland. Tasted like water, egg whites, and chives with two wontons. Had to dump a whole ramekin of Soy Sauce into the soup to get through it. Not the worst I've had, not even comparable to the Hot-and-Sour atrocity, but yet bland none the less.\n\nAs my party started to eat the entrees as I was still finishing my soup, I got the sense they were underwhelmed with the food. Wow, was that an understatement.\n\nThe Wok Seared Filet ($18) was one of the worst beef dishes I've ever tasted in my life. I don't know whose bright idea it is to take a \"Filet\", pound it out like a Flank Steak, and then serve it essentially deep fried in a tasteless sauce but it's just plain bad. The beef has some spice, but absolutely no flavor whatsoever. After chewing through two pieces (I've had sirloin steaks from Chinese fast food places that's more tender) I was done with this dish. \n\nNext up was the Chairman Mao's Chicken ($16). It's essentially five pieces of chicken deep-fried in a basket with no seasoning or sauce. They give you two ramekins of \"sweet and spicy\" sauce but it's barely enough to cover one piece of the tasteless fried chicken. I wouldn't be surprised if the chefs here (at least that evening) has never seen a salt or pepper shaker. \n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($14)- this was the only okay dish on the table. The noodles were tasty, however the Wild Boar wasn't very flavorful (no seasoning, big surprise...) and prepared poorly (so much gristle.. yuck!)\n\nBeijing Knife Cut Noodles ($12) - Probably just as disappointing on par with the Hot and Sour Soup and \"Filet\". The dish looked like a bowl of Top Ramen after the served \"mixed\" it together and had a weird, sweet hint to it. \n\nPork Belly Sliders - Never came, waitress probably \"forgot\" since she took our order in her head.  The rest of the meal and service was so laughable we didn't even ask about it. \n\nOverall- this is probably the worst \"Chinese\" place I've ever encountered in my lifetime. Everyone in our party was displeased and left us wishing we had made the trek out to somewhere such as San Tung instead. The food was so bland it makes airplane cuisine sound appealing. To top it off- the vacant tables that we had requested (\"Sorry those are reserved\") were still sitting empty 2 hours later. \n\nIf you're into foo-foo fancy looking expensive \"Chinese\" food that tastes like cardboard this is the place for you. \n\nMy recommendation- save about $20/head and go to Panda Express downstairs instead if you're really craving Asian food.  They will actually put some thought into seasoning your food and the person serving you probably won't act like they take it personally if you don't like something.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-10-01"}, {"excerpts": ["We tried several varieties of the noodles, I really enjoyed the Beijing Knife Cut Noodles the most as they are shaven noodles made from scratch.

M.Y. China - Martin Yan's China - was a nice discovery for us.\n\nMy husband and I came to San Francisco for the 2018 Bay to Breakers last weekend. We had eaten way too many times in Chinatown on previous trips to the city. This time, we wanted to try some place new. The manager at Hotel Zelos recommended M.Y. China. \n\nThe manager's recommendation turned out to be a real treat. M.Y. China is located in the vicinity of our hotel near Union Square. The walk from hotel to restaurant is less than 15 minutes. We came here twice in a span of 3 days.\n\nFirst Visit May 19, 2018\n\nThree of us came shortly after 5:00 on Saturday for dinner. There was no line. We were quickly seated at a table just outside the main entrance. The view from our table was amazing. Yes, we were dining on the 4th floor of the busy Westfield San Francisco Centre, but as we pan our surroundings, we didn't get much of the hectic vibes at all.\n\nWe ordered Wok Seared Beef, Grandma's Gai Lan, Steamed Tofu & Portobello and brown rice. \n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Aromatic arugula enhanced the flavors of the the meat. Loved the slightly chewy, yet tender, beef.  \n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Lightly seasoned. Saut\u00e9ed the way my Mom used to. Loved the Chinese sausage.\n* Steamed Tofu & Portobello - Beautiful presentation. Tofu was silky smooth, very fresh. Loved the scallion-ginger sauce \n* Brown Rice - Perfect accompaniment for the dishes. Loved the texture. \n\nSecond Visit Monday, May 21, 2018\n\nWe were initially concerned about the choice of M.Y. China for our lunch for 5 because one of our guests is a vegetarian. But it turned out that there were quite a few dishes that would work. We ordered 6 dishes to share, including 3 vegetarian ones.\n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Tasted just as delicious as Saturday's, but the beef didn't look as appetizing. Presentation a little off.\n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Every bit as good as Saturday's. Fresh gai lan, lean lap cheong. Loved it.\n* Garlic Pea Shoots - Vegetarian. This was a hit. Fresh and tender. Seasoned just right.\n* Eggplant & Tofu Clay Pot - Vegetarian. Loved the flavor of basil and black pepper sauce.\n* Tempeh Sliders (2 orders) - Vegetarian. Nicely garnished with pickled daikon and cilantro.\n* Roasted Chicken - Excellent. Crispy skin, tender meat. Didn't even need the seasoned dipping salt. Easily our favorite for this lunch.\n* Brown Rice - Very good. Nice to find brown rice in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nOur overall impression:\n\n* Food - Excellent, as expected of the renown Chef Martin Yan.\n* Service - Just okay. Saturday server seemed to rush us when there wasn't a crowd waiting to be seated. Service was better on Monday.\n* Price - Reasonable for a good San Francisco restaurant.\n* Location - Convenient. Accessible by public transportation. No need to drive and fight downtown traffic.\n\nIn summary, all 5 of us enjoyed dining here, although there were comments about the dishes showing up lukewarm, not hot. The gai lan, for example, was served already cold. That was disappointing.\n\nIt's a solid 4-Stars for M.Y. China for both of our visits. We'll be here again on our next trip to San Francisco. This time, we'll inquire about the secret Chinese menu mentioned in one of the Yelp reviews. We'll also try the popular Dim Sum Sampler and the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.\n\nA final note: I don't know what management can do about screaming kid(s), if anything. On Saturday, there was a grandma, mom and a young kid seated at the table cater-cornered to ours. The kid was screaming repeatedly. At one point, she got on top of the table. She  pulled on a plate, dropped and shattered it on the floor. Her screaming became piercing. It was impossible to carry on a normal conversation.

I believe the rate per hour on weekend is $2.5 (please correct me if I'm wrong), but it's not mindblowing crazy. \n\nFOOD\n======================================================================\nFor DIMSUM section we ordered;\n1. Beijing dumpling (that's what people here have been recommending): skin is quite thick, you could almost tell that it has too thick when you taste the flour more than the filling). \n2. Har Gaw: nothing special. Other dimsum have better har gaw\n\nFor Noodle we ordered;\n1. Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood (\u6d77\u9c9c\u58a8\u6c41\u6735\u9eba) $18. I asked our server what kind of noodles they were serving with for this dish, turned out the noodle was a point finger size cut. So it was not like regular chinese pulled noodle (which I thought it would be). The meats cooked with the noodle are shrimp, scallops, calamari, with brussels sprouts and bell peppers.\nTruthfully I dislike this dish, what I had in mind, it was going to be similar with Italian squid ink pasta, except they're using chinese noodle. However, what we had was totally different with what I had in mind. The taste itself, wow, underrated. I feel like eating regular chinese noodle in a fancy restaurant with premium price. Lack of flavor, portion is enough for two people, and this dish costs $18 exclude tax and tip.\n\n2. We also ordered Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles (\u91ce\u8c6c\u5200\u526a\u9eba) $16.

Again, they were serving this dish with a finger cut size noodle. It was easy for the kids to stab it with forks, but again, this second noodle dish lack of flavor. It even almost tasted the same with the first noodle dish we ordered (the squid ink noodle).\n\nFor the drink we ordered milk jasmine tea, it was just okay. \n\nTo sum it up; \nThis would be an American Chinese restaurant that has fancy decoration and located prime inside the Westfield Mall. It may be your dining destination if you are \n1. Never adventure in Chinese cuisine\n2. Going to the mall is your one stop destination where you want to shop and have lunch at the same time.\n3.

Good balance of tofu, egg drop, mushroom, etc. we always order this when we come here. \n\nMu Shi pork tacos - first i was skeptical of anything that has an Americanized name like Mu Shu (bringing me back to greasy bastardized Americanized Chinese fast food from middle school days in CT). This one is a winner. Perfectly seasoned. Innovative, and I love the taco shells too - a bit like Peking Duck wraps but not quite. A prefect dish. \n\nSOLID:\nWild boar scissor cut noodles. Like the texture and shape of the noodles here. Pretty good. \n\nOrder Kung bao chicken with less sugar. Well executed dish. I will never own the wok with industrial stove to cook this dish at high temperature at home. Even though I am in general more weary of Americanized dishes, the breading on the chicken is thin and crispy and the bell peppers is crunchy, with none of the gooey sauce that often covers the ingredients in a fast food Chinese restaurant. \n\nPeking duck - excellent. I like the buns that come with the Peking duck. The skins are just right. Ask for more scallions with this. \n\nIf you come here for happy hour, the red wine with 7 grapes blend is decent and good value. \n\nSKIP:\nSkip the wok-based beef - the meat is a bit too chewy.\n\nCrispy veggie roll is solid but not exceptional. The sauce is a bit too sweet. Ask them for ginger soy sauce (that accompanies seafood dumpling) for the alternative sauce. \n\nSteamed vegetable dumplings - too bland\n\nPork riblet - the first bite tasted good but then you get a bit tired of the meat due to the sweetness and greasiness.

China with a great deal of trepidation because as good as his dishes looked on PBS back in the day, I thought he may have passed the point of relevancy when it comes to fine dining in a city with as much food gravitas as San Francisco.\n\nHowever, Yan's elaborate operation on the 4th floor of the Westfield Shopping Centre holds its own in many respects (photo: http://bit.ly/11zPDlJ). It just fell short of what I was hoping it would be. Perhaps my expectations were escalated by the fact that I had experienced two failed attempts to dine here right after it opened - one time due to a private party, the other because they were just full up. I finally made it as a solitary diner and was seated at the end of the long noodle counter. The menu is not very complicated, and I knew from the hype that chef Tony Chu was known for holding the record of pulling 16,000 noodles in two minutes flat. Clearly this uniquely dexterous feat meant you had to try the noodles which I did.\n\nBased on Michael Bauer's recommendation on sfgate.com, I went for the $14 Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which were definitely the high point of the meal - irregularly cut handmade noodles tossed with shallots and Shaoxing wine (photo: http://bit.ly/12E0Kwm). I liked the rustic quality, and they were flavorful enough with the pieces of pork-like boar. I just wish there were more ingredients tossed in for a greater contrast in texture and flavor. Probably out of curiosity more than anything else, I ordered the $9 pair of Mu Shu Pork Tacos, which were a cheeky take on the standard Mandarin dish that comes with a stack of crepes.\n\nWhat arrived was a pair of tacos held upright in a stand with the mu shu pork stuffed in soft shells that were definitely not tortillas (photo: http://bit.ly/ZLSoh9). The net result was tasty but sloppy as the sesame oil would dribble out of the taco shell and onto my arm despite the proper vertical head turning in eating them. My last dish was the rather ordinary $8 Stir-Fried Green Beans which I ordered to counter the carb overload (photo: http://bit.ly/15Dd8zr). The beans had the right snap, but they were on the saucy side with a slightly oily aftertaste. All in all, I liked the boldness of the dishes even though I found they still need more refinement in their execution to satisfy at least my palate.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...solid handmade noodles but the tacos were more a novelty and the green beans didn't need that much sauce\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...very dramatic, a good use of the space underneath the dome...but it did get lonely being the only one eating at the counter (photo: http://bit.ly/17TXZtf)\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and helpful, no problems there\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if Yan can cook, then I pay Yan...simple as that", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-04-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered two noodle dishes: Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken and Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.

For Chinese New Year my family and I wanted to celebrate at R&G lounge, but unfortunately it was completely booked up the whole night. So we settled on with MY China instead. We made reservations online using OpenTable, and surprisingly it was completely open ended.\n\nArriving at the restaurant 15 minutes early, we were in for a different surprise. The restaurant was packed and there was no available seating inside the restaurant. We asked about our reservation for 7:15. The hostess asked us to please wait a moment. From my quick understanding it seems they were inundated with last minute guests and did not bother to reserve seating for the guests who made reservations. An automatic star downgrade in my book. The hostess made us wait for another 15 minutes. We asked again about our table, and she said oh what is your name? SMH, we've been standing here for 15 minutes and we just talked to you. They in between seated a table of 8 people who had no reservations. They offered to put us at a table out of the way and on the outside, after we complained lightly about getting the 5 minute wait end around.\n\nWith that out of the way, the service was a lot better. Our waitor Bolo, did a great job discussing the menu with us and treated us with great care. The food was all delivered to our table very quickly. Can't fault that table service.\n\nThe food itself was reasonable, but not spectacular or of great value. We had the following dishes:\n\n+ Steamed Seasonal Fish - ***/5 - The portion was a bit too small. We wanted a whole fish with the head and tail in tact specifically for Chinese New Year, but they could not accommodate this because we were not a table of 6.\n+ Wok Seared Beef - ***/5 - Pretty standard wasn't absolutely wowing me.\n+ Whole Crispy Roast Chicken - ****/5 - pretty decently cooked, very moist cuts and everything tasted great, they even provided 5 spice dipping powder on the side.\n+ Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles - **/5 - not a fan of this dish, not enough chunks of the boar meat, and the noodles were a bit odd in texture.\n+ Garlic Pea Shoots (Dau Miu) - ****/5 - pretty simple, nicely done, and at standard.\n\nOn the outside, the restaurant looks very extravagant, modern and upscale. It just did not live up to the expectation that I had in terms of quality for the value. I understand that the place they are in is high rent for the sq/space.

After all, I grew up watching him and since he's Cantonese too!  =)  Bf & I finally checked it out this past Saturday night & were lucky enough to get a 6:45 reservation with only an hour notice through Opentable.\n\nWe have both heard mixed reviews on the restaurant and weren't honestly expecting much, but boy were we wrong!  We had to wait about 5 minutes or so pass our reservation time, but at least we got a photo opp with Martin Yan himself while we were waiting by the front.  He definitely knows how to entertain as he was explaining the noodle making process to part of the restaurant.  And he walks around to some tables as well (including ours a couple times).  Gotta love that!  \n\nFor the appetizers we got  pork belly bun sliders ($8) & crab & pork dumplings ($12).  We also ordered: wild boar scissor cut noodles ($14), claypot braised beef short rib ($25), and da mieu (pea sprouts) ($16), one bowl of rice ($2), and for dessert, sugar egg puffs ($8).  \n\nThe pork belly bun sliders were so tasty!  The meat in his was quite a bit fattier than mine however.  I prefer these over Chairman Bao!  For the dumplings we got 4 & like Cherylynn commented, they were served on ceramic spoons in the steamer, which caused the dumplings to stick and most of them were also served punctured already, so we slurped most of the juice from the spoon directly.  Though it was aesthetically pleasing, this presentation makes no sense because the spoons were so hot and because the dumpling sticks to the spoons making it hard to get out.  I tasted the crab, while he said he couldn't.  I guess that was a trade off since he got one dumpling that wasn't punctured!  We loved the wild boar scissor cut noodle because of it's lightness and I'm always a sucker for my noodles.  We just wished that the noodles were a little longer.  The taste of the  boar was light too, which was a plus.  The short rib was tender and plentiful.  I loved the onions and the herbs and sauce, everything tied together so well and had that little bit of heat.  Da Mieu is pretty standard everywhere I've had it, with no complaints here either!  Last but not least, the sugar egg puffs!  We liked how they weren't as covered in sugar as the traditional Chinese places we've had them at does it.  However, they were greasier than what we're used to.  But, a plus here are the dipping sauces!  We loved the raspberry the most, but the chocolate fondue and vanilla chantilly creme are great as well.  \n\nService was pretty good and polite, but the restaurant was so busy that I think refills on water were overlooked for our table and our neighbor's.   The ambiance is eclectic mod Asian.  The bathroom is in the corner and has no door (it's unisex) but with several ceiling to floor stalls for some privacy!  The food portions, minus the appetizers were pretty generous.  We did have leftover claypot.  All in all, $102 for all that food plus one beer isn't bad.

They are cooked well and are a nice vegetarian option. The beef hand pulled noodles are also good. The presentation is very neat and the broth is quite tasty. But I would recommend trying the dry noodles to the noodle soups are you can taste more of the \"wok\" flavor and it's much easier to share. Also, the chefs sometimes put on a show as they pull the noodles right in front of your table. \n\nMy favorite entree has to be the five spice pork ribs. Don't let the word ribs deceive you into the dish being messy and hard to eat because it's quite the opposite. The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. The pork ribs I presume is slow cooked and then fried a bit on the outside to give it that crispy golden color and taste. It's so delicious that you must try for yourself. The lamb chops are also on the top of my list. It's seasoned with cumin and chili powder and tastes so flavorful and juicy. Also, you can give the Peking duck a try. It's not the best Peking duck but it is still good and satisfies the craving. \n\nFrom the small eats, the tea smoked pork belly sliders are wonderful. They are tender and goes nicely with the bun. But I have to say I've had better as the pork belly wasn't melt in your mouth. \n\nI've made three visits here already and have loved the food and experience here each time.

I mentioned to the server that the kids would want to see it and he said he would be sure to tell us if they pulled some noodles in the kitchen. A few minutes later someone who I assume was a manager came out and actually made a point to tell us what time they would start and that he would make sure he came back and got us. I was really impressed that they took the time to make sure we had a good experience.\n\nI don't feel that I can give a really detailed analysis of the food because it was a rushed dinner but M.Y.

It's a good taste tester for the kitchen, and a very welcoming popular BBQ item (honey glazed BBQ pork, what is there not to like unless you are a meat hating hipster but craves bacon wrapped sausages once in a while?). Generally lean for the most part, yet each bite was tender and juicy all the way through. A very delicate marinade, although the final roasting process probably had a tad too sweet of a molasses splash. The best part? Picking up a random slice (closer to the edges) thinking it's all lean, and when you bite into it, there's a portion of fat that somehow crept in. It melts in your mouth like warm sweet butter and honey, and suddenly you feel like you were shot into the skies. Or akin to eating at your favorite sushi bar, and the chef gives you a run of the mill looking item, and when you eat it you discover there's toro, uni, and wagyu in it. So yeah, this cha siu is great...yet subtly pornographic...like reading a novel called \"50 Shades Of Pork\".   \n\nSo no, ordering BBQ pork appetizer plate at a nicer Cantonese Chinese restaurant during dinner, is not an unusual thing. We don't have restaurants like Tin Lung Heen in Hong Kong that take Spanish Iberico black pig and use premium cuts to make cha siu.l...so places like Koi Palace and even MYC offering something like this that may be above average for expats, and very decent according to \"King Of FOBenese Food\", ain't so bad.\n\nStir fried bok choy with salted fish - when this arrived, it was as if the veggies were quickly clear stir fried with very little to no oil, and was very bland. Turns out our waitress misheard my \"less salt less oil\" and thought we meant \"no salt no oil\", and the kitchen withheld the salted fish (which she said was oily). We had this taken back and what a difference it made afterwards. The salted fish quantity and enhancement was not strong, but did make the dish taste better. Was half the price of large pea sprout with garlic ($16), so if you want your greens on, this is a safe choice.\n\n4 dishes for two, came out to a shade over $50, which is not unreasonable for the location, quality, and to factor in d\u00e9cor and service.

I've had boar in previous meals before but the meat was so thinly sliced, it could have been beef tongue for all I know!\n\nNext entrees that came out was the fried rice. My little one wanted pork with the fried rice instead of the scallops. Again the meat was so small, you could barely make out the meat. But I was really disappointed with the egg whites in the fried rice. Should have paid better attention to the menu. Anyway, this was by far the worst fried rice I ever had!  I'm still cringing at the thought that I paid $10 for this side dish.  Arghhhh....\n\nOk, moving along.... apparently appetizers of bang bang chicken wings came out boneless. Not sure if we got someone else's order or if their ordering system really translates \"sauce on the side\" to be \"boneless\" like our server stated. But I didn't want to send it back to try and figure out what it would even taste like without the orange chicken like sauce. And my pork belly sliders were on the mediocre side. One of my sliders was actually wet. Hopefully from the steam and not something else.\n\nNext entr\u00e9e that came was Chairman Mao's chicken.  I'm not sure where the sweet and spicy sauce is but there was a lot of red peppers. Like a lot!  For a table that asked for it not to be spicy, I think their ordering system mistranslated my order.... Again!  \n\nAt this point, we're stuffed and guess what comes out last?!  The mixed green salad with papaya and shrimp. At least that was good compared to everything else that came out of the kitchen before it. And looking at the salad, I'm glad their ordering system didn't mistranslate this one!  \n\nOverall, I'm glad I came in to check it out and happy that my boys can say they had wild boar.

A great (non-chain) restaurant in a mall? It's true. The energy of the place is incredible with the open faced kitchen where you can see the many chefs preparing everything by hand. Martin Yan was entertaining a group the night we were there, complete with camera crew so we got to see something special. The head chef, Tony, is one of the top chefs from China and he is incredibly warm as well as incredibly talented. We watched him make hand pulled noodles blindfolded. If you've ever seen this done, it's already a feat using your sight.\n\nDrinks:  Tasty and creative. There was a spicy drink called Fire in the Wok that I recommend if you want a little bite or something to fight off a cold. I enjoyed Under the Bronze Bell, a champagne drink mixed with ginger liquor and St. Germain Elderflower (and a touch of grenadine I think), named after the huge bell shipped from China that is now the centerpiece of the bar.\n\nI'm actually giving 4.5 stars. Half star goes away for our server not telling us we'd ordered too much food for our table of 8 even after we specifically asked her to let us know if we ordered too much. For starters, we could have done without duplicates of the dishes. It didn't help that there was some confusion among our group as to what people were ordering. But having said that, our server and the rest of the staff were outstanding.\n\nNow the upside to ordering all the food we had is that I can say there are SO many yummy things on the menu. \n\nDumplings: Wild boar, pork & crab, seafood, all were outstanding. I'm a huge fan of DTF and am waiting for the day one opens in the south bay (please let it be soon). The first two are served in traditional steam baskets and dramatically served in individual soup spoons (careful, they're hot!) and a slice of carrot. Downside is the carrot doesn't cover the whole surface area so the dumplings still tear open. Upside is the spoon catches all the delicous broth from the dumpling so you can enjoy it with the chewy perfection that is the skin.\n\nAvocado shrimp rolls: I could have skipped this one. Fresh ingredients but even with the peanut dipping sauce I was more interested in devouring other things.\n\nMu Shu tacos: Very generous helping for 2 tacos. Can easily feed 4 as an appetizer.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: One of our favorites, highly recommended.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Cold, so maybe not everyone is a fan, but these thinner noodles have lots of flavor and a little spice.\n\nHK Crispy Noodles: You can't go wrong with crispy noodles. =) Very traditional and one of my childhood favorites, the noodles around the outside are crispy and then soft in the middle under the sauce and toppings.\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp: This is delicious pretty much anywhere you go but these are great. Lightly glazed, not drowning in sauce.\n\nBok Choy: Simple, basic, and a good side that goes with everything.\n\nMapo Tofu: Great if you like silken tofu. Not so great if you prefer the texture of firmer tofu.\n\nForbidden Rice: You want to order it just for the name. But it doesn't disappoint. This was probably the dish that surprised everyone with all the flavor.\n\nTwo of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. Both were a big hit and happily devoured.\n\nLastly, we received a very cool dessert made by Tony. It was a large plate of very fine noodles fried and covered in sugar, strawberry syrup, and berries. It may sound strange but it was so light and delicious. It was almost like Chinese cotton candy.\n\nIn general, because the menu can be a little confusing portion-wise, the noodle and wok dishes can easily feed a table of 4. Even some of the sides like the bok choy and mapo tofu can feed up to 6 unless you want a generous portion of those items and don't plan on sampling other things.\n\nThis is a little far for me to visit all the time but I will definitely be back!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The har gow was made with large shrimps, the forbidden rice was great, the shaken beef with arugula was sub par, and wild boar scissor cut noodles were no more than par.

Sharp presentation with each dumpling resting in a large soup spoon.  Genius because you could just eat it off the spoon, IF it weren't for the fact that the spoon is scalding hot.  There is also a thin slice of carrot underneath the dumpling to separate it from the spoon, but that didn't seem to prevent the skin from sticking to the spoon and tearing upon consumption.

Major sad face because why is hair usually found in food AFTER most of it is consumed? Well at least it has been in my experience.  We called a manager over and showed him.  His face immediately turned grim and sullen, he took away the remainder of the dish and left promptly.  We saw him talking to one of the kitchen workers; one of the perks of an open kitchen, we customers can see most of what's going on. He came back to our table and told us he ordered another 3 pork and black truffle dumplings on the house for us.

"], "author": "L B.", "review": "I don't even know where to begin.\n\nCame in for dinner on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and another couple.\n\nLet's just say if this place even deserves a star, it's for the decor and ambiance. It really is a pleasant looking restaurant and the aesthetics of the open-ish kitchen are also nice as you walk in. The hostess led us to a less-than-desirable table by the hallway to the bathroom (yes, we did have reservations for 4 through OpenTable), and upon asking to be re-seated at a number of other open tables were told they were all also \"reserved\". Not a big deal but more on this later (you can probably guess what happened). \n\nThe service to start was prompt, and the waitress seemed personable and took our orders. We elected to go with 2 Hot & Sour Soups, 2 Westlake Wonton Soups, the Beijing Beef Cut Noodles, Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, Pork Sliders, Chairman Mao's Chicken, and Wok Seared Beef Filet. The first red flag should have been when our waitress took our order mentally, and then returned a minute later to double-check which entree our friends had ordered (there's a reason why servers write it down)\n\nThe soups came out quickly, litteraly about 2 minutes after the waitress \"confirmed\" our order- I got the Hot & Sour, which I am a huge fan of at 99% of Chinese restaurants. Not this one. At first glance I would tell something was wrong... the soup wasn't of its traditional brown hue but concentrated very heavily with a vibrant red. One taste of the soup told me enough- it tasted like a thick paste mixed with Sriracha. Literally inedible and probably the worst thing I've tasted in a long, long time. I alerted our waitress to send the soup back (either this is the worst recipe on the planet or the chef of the night dumped way too much hot sauce into the soup) and request a bowl of the Westlake instead. She snatched the bowl off the table like I had personally offended her, and stormed off to the kitchen. She then disappeared for no-less than 15 minutes and forced us to ask two other different servers where our soup was (\"Coming right out\"). The replacement bowl of the Wonton soup made it out, followed 30 seconds later by our noodles and entrees. Great. \n\nThe soup itself- bland. Tasted like water, egg whites, and chives with two wontons. Had to dump a whole ramekin of Soy Sauce into the soup to get through it. Not the worst I've had, not even comparable to the Hot-and-Sour atrocity, but yet bland none the less.\n\nAs my party started to eat the entrees as I was still finishing my soup, I got the sense they were underwhelmed with the food. Wow, was that an understatement.\n\nThe Wok Seared Filet ($18) was one of the worst beef dishes I've ever tasted in my life. I don't know whose bright idea it is to take a \"Filet\", pound it out like a Flank Steak, and then serve it essentially deep fried in a tasteless sauce but it's just plain bad. The beef has some spice, but absolutely no flavor whatsoever. After chewing through two pieces (I've had sirloin steaks from Chinese fast food places that's more tender) I was done with this dish. \n\nNext up was the Chairman Mao's Chicken ($16). It's essentially five pieces of chicken deep-fried in a basket with no seasoning or sauce. They give you two ramekins of \"sweet and spicy\" sauce but it's barely enough to cover one piece of the tasteless fried chicken. I wouldn't be surprised if the chefs here (at least that evening) has never seen a salt or pepper shaker. \n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($14)- this was the only okay dish on the table. The noodles were tasty, however the Wild Boar wasn't very flavorful (no seasoning, big surprise...) and prepared poorly (so much gristle.. yuck!)\n\nBeijing Knife Cut Noodles ($12) - Probably just as disappointing on par with the Hot and Sour Soup and \"Filet\". The dish looked like a bowl of Top Ramen after the served \"mixed\" it together and had a weird, sweet hint to it. \n\nPork Belly Sliders - Never came, waitress probably \"forgot\" since she took our order in her head.  The rest of the meal and service was so laughable we didn't even ask about it. \n\nOverall- this is probably the worst \"Chinese\" place I've ever encountered in my lifetime. Everyone in our party was displeased and left us wishing we had made the trek out to somewhere such as San Tung instead. The food was so bland it makes airplane cuisine sound appealing. To top it off- the vacant tables that we had requested (\"Sorry those are reserved\") were still sitting empty 2 hours later. \n\nIf you're into foo-foo fancy looking expensive \"Chinese\" food that tastes like cardboard this is the place for you. \n\nMy recommendation- save about $20/head and go to Panda Express downstairs instead if you're really craving Asian food.  They will actually put some thought into seasoning your food and the person serving you probably won't act like they take it personally if you don't like something.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-10-01"}, {"excerpts": ["The Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles were well done and had a nice firm chewy texture, the Stir Fried Green Beans were tasty and  nicely crunchy.

The restaurant was mostly empty with a handful of tables finishing the remains of their dinners.  \n\nThe food was fine, little on the sweet side and some dishes more authentic than others.  The waiter was attentive.  The food arrived within a reasonable time.  The Whole Wheat Potstickers were fine if less than crispy.  The Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles were well done and had a nice firm chewy texture, the Stir Fried Green Beans were tasty and  nicely crunchy. The Shandong Beef Rolls were less successful, the beef was not marinated in the traditional northern style and with too much sauce.  \n\nBeyond the food, the kitchen staff was irritating with their persistently loud and energetic bantering.  They were shouting, gesturing and taking pictures of each other with their IPhones.  We both knew Cantonese and Taishanese and the loud noise in the open kitchen was getting more tedious as the night wore on.   \n\nAt the end of our meal, we finally mentioned to the manager about the irritating noise from the kitchen and he told us that we could move to another table.  He also went on to explain to us that the kitchen staff needed to be able to communicate with each other about their work.  Fine, is shouting really necessary for the communication?  \n\nWe both knew Caucasian friends that are well versed in Chinese, some with greater eloquence than us.  This manager was obviously clueless about what is being bantered about in the open kitchen or he would not have offered his explanation.  He was also obviously a block head since he got all huffy when I told him he does not know what the hell was talking about.  He then got up within inches of my face and spoke directly into my ear and said in a threatening tone \"you should watch how you speak to me!\"  \n\nWhat?!?  Was this guy going to do me the Tony Soprano or the Al Capone?\n\nWell, that was actually the high point of the dinner.  The guy made me laugh and that is worth something.

A great (non-chain) restaurant in a mall? It's true. The energy of the place is incredible with the open faced kitchen where you can see the many chefs preparing everything by hand. Martin Yan was entertaining a group the night we were there, complete with camera crew so we got to see something special. The head chef, Tony, is one of the top chefs from China and he is incredibly warm as well as incredibly talented. We watched him make hand pulled noodles blindfolded. If you've ever seen this done, it's already a feat using your sight.\n\nDrinks:  Tasty and creative. There was a spicy drink called Fire in the Wok that I recommend if you want a little bite or something to fight off a cold. I enjoyed Under the Bronze Bell, a champagne drink mixed with ginger liquor and St. Germain Elderflower (and a touch of grenadine I think), named after the huge bell shipped from China that is now the centerpiece of the bar.\n\nI'm actually giving 4.5 stars. Half star goes away for our server not telling us we'd ordered too much food for our table of 8 even after we specifically asked her to let us know if we ordered too much. For starters, we could have done without duplicates of the dishes. It didn't help that there was some confusion among our group as to what people were ordering. But having said that, our server and the rest of the staff were outstanding.\n\nNow the upside to ordering all the food we had is that I can say there are SO many yummy things on the menu. \n\nDumplings: Wild boar, pork & crab, seafood, all were outstanding. I'm a huge fan of DTF and am waiting for the day one opens in the south bay (please let it be soon). The first two are served in traditional steam baskets and dramatically served in individual soup spoons (careful, they're hot!) and a slice of carrot. Downside is the carrot doesn't cover the whole surface area so the dumplings still tear open. Upside is the spoon catches all the delicous broth from the dumpling so you can enjoy it with the chewy perfection that is the skin.\n\nAvocado shrimp rolls: I could have skipped this one. Fresh ingredients but even with the peanut dipping sauce I was more interested in devouring other things.\n\nMu Shu tacos: Very generous helping for 2 tacos. Can easily feed 4 as an appetizer.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: One of our favorites, highly recommended.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Cold, so maybe not everyone is a fan, but these thinner noodles have lots of flavor and a little spice.\n\nHK Crispy Noodles: You can't go wrong with crispy noodles. =) Very traditional and one of my childhood favorites, the noodles around the outside are crispy and then soft in the middle under the sauce and toppings.\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp: This is delicious pretty much anywhere you go but these are great. Lightly glazed, not drowning in sauce.\n\nBok Choy: Simple, basic, and a good side that goes with everything.\n\nMapo Tofu: Great if you like silken tofu. Not so great if you prefer the texture of firmer tofu.\n\nForbidden Rice: You want to order it just for the name. But it doesn't disappoint. This was probably the dish that surprised everyone with all the flavor.\n\nTwo of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. Both were a big hit and happily devoured.\n\nLastly, we received a very cool dessert made by Tony. It was a large plate of very fine noodles fried and covered in sugar, strawberry syrup, and berries. It may sound strange but it was so light and delicious. It was almost like Chinese cotton candy.\n\nIn general, because the menu can be a little confusing portion-wise, the noodle and wok dishes can easily feed a table of 4. Even some of the sides like the bok choy and mapo tofu can feed up to 6 unless you want a generous portion of those items and don't plan on sampling other things.\n\nThis is a little far for me to visit all the time but I will definitely be back!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the dan dan noodles, crispy noodles, and beijing knife cut noodles.

There is also a thin slice of carrot underneath the dumpling to separate it from the spoon, but that didn't seem to prevent the skin from sticking to the spoon and tearing upon consumption. In terms of taste, it was just average...  definitely had better xlb with less extravagant ingredients.\n\nAt my table of 4, I had the honor of eating the 5th and last dumpling. After the first bite, I noticed a little something sticking out of the meat. Out of curiosity, I pulled it...and pulled it... and pulled it... and it turns out it was a hair.  Major sad face because why is hair usually found in food AFTER most of it is consumed? Well at least it has been in my experience.  We called a manager over and showed him.  His face immediately turned grim and sullen, he took away the remainder of the dish and left promptly.  We saw him talking to one of the kitchen workers; one of the perks of an open kitchen, we customers can see most of what's going on. He came back to our table and told us he ordered another 3 pork and black truffle dumplings on the house for us.  Very odd arrangement, but we really weren't expecting anything since we ate the majority of the dish already. We didn't really want the extra 3 dumplings either since we were getting full already.

The vegetarian Longevity Noodle soup was very garlicky, so much so I couldn't taste much of anything else. Kung Pao chicken was boring and bland without any sauce at all. The Honey Glazed Shrimp were good. The Forbidden rice was really good. \n\nThe service was uneven. Our waiter got waylaid taking the order from another table that was having a lot of indecision. We told one of the staff that we were ready to order and rather than send someone over, we were told we had to wait for our waiter. Not his fault at all, but usually someone will jump in to help out in situations like this. \n\nEmpty dishes sat on our table for a long time, piling up as we finished each dish. After quite a while someone did come over and start clearing them away and from then on kept them cleared away. \n\nIt was fun seeing the noodles being made and it really delighted the kids a the table next to us.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-03-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Two of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. "], "author": "Nicole T.", "review": "The first thought is, really? A great (non-chain) restaurant in a mall? It's true. The energy of the place is incredible with the open faced kitchen where you can see the many chefs preparing everything by hand. Martin Yan was entertaining a group the night we were there, complete with camera crew so we got to see something special. The head chef, Tony, is one of the top chefs from China and he is incredibly warm as well as incredibly talented. We watched him make hand pulled noodles blindfolded. If you've ever seen this done, it's already a feat using your sight.\n\nDrinks:  Tasty and creative. There was a spicy drink called Fire in the Wok that I recommend if you want a little bite or something to fight off a cold. I enjoyed Under the Bronze Bell, a champagne drink mixed with ginger liquor and St. Germain Elderflower (and a touch of grenadine I think), named after the huge bell shipped from China that is now the centerpiece of the bar.\n\nI'm actually giving 4.5 stars. Half star goes away for our server not telling us we'd ordered too much food for our table of 8 even after we specifically asked her to let us know if we ordered too much. For starters, we could have done without duplicates of the dishes. It didn't help that there was some confusion among our group as to what people were ordering. But having said that, our server and the rest of the staff were outstanding.\n\nNow the upside to ordering all the food we had is that I can say there are SO many yummy things on the menu. \n\nDumplings: Wild boar, pork & crab, seafood, all were outstanding. I'm a huge fan of DTF and am waiting for the day one opens in the south bay (please let it be soon). The first two are served in traditional steam baskets and dramatically served in individual soup spoons (careful, they're hot!) and a slice of carrot. Downside is the carrot doesn't cover the whole surface area so the dumplings still tear open. Upside is the spoon catches all the delicous broth from the dumpling so you can enjoy it with the chewy perfection that is the skin.\n\nAvocado shrimp rolls: I could have skipped this one. Fresh ingredients but even with the peanut dipping sauce I was more interested in devouring other things.\n\nMu Shu tacos: Very generous helping for 2 tacos. Can easily feed 4 as an appetizer.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: One of our favorites, highly recommended.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Cold, so maybe not everyone is a fan, but these thinner noodles have lots of flavor and a little spice.\n\nHK Crispy Noodles: You can't go wrong with crispy noodles. =) Very traditional and one of my childhood favorites, the noodles around the outside are crispy and then soft in the middle under the sauce and toppings.\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp: This is delicious pretty much anywhere you go but these are great. Lightly glazed, not drowning in sauce.\n\nBok Choy: Simple, basic, and a good side that goes with everything.\n\nMapo Tofu: Great if you like silken tofu. Not so great if you prefer the texture of firmer tofu.\n\nForbidden Rice: You want to order it just for the name. But it doesn't disappoint. This was probably the dish that surprised everyone with all the flavor.\n\nTwo of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. Both were a big hit and happily devoured.\n\nLastly, we received a very cool dessert made by Tony. It was a large plate of very fine noodles fried and covered in sugar, strawberry syrup, and berries. It may sound strange but it was so light and delicious. It was almost like Chinese cotton candy.\n\nIn general, because the menu can be a little confusing portion-wise, the noodle and wok dishes can easily feed a table of 4. Even some of the sides like the bok choy and mapo tofu can feed up to 6 unless you want a generous portion of those items and don't plan on sampling other things.\n\nThis is a little far for me to visit all the time but I will definitely be back!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-28"}], "squid ink snap noodles with seafood": [{"excerpts": ["Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood (\u6d77\u9c9c\u58a8\u6c41\u6735\u9eba) ", "$18.

So you would have to park your car inside the parking structure, otherwise parking street is the other option. I believe the rate per hour on weekend is $2.5 (please correct me if I'm wrong), but it's not mindblowing crazy. \n\nFOOD\n======================================================================\nFor DIMSUM section we ordered;\n1. Beijing dumpling (that's what people here have been recommending): skin is quite thick, you could almost tell that it has too thick when you taste the flour more than the filling). \n2. Har Gaw: nothing special. Other dimsum have better har gaw\n\nFor Noodle we ordered;\n1. Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood (\u6d77\u9c9c\u58a8\u6c41\u6735\u9eba) $18. I asked our server what kind of noodles they were serving with for this dish, turned out the noodle was a point finger size cut. So it was not like regular chinese pulled noodle (which I thought it would be). The meats cooked with the noodle are shrimp, scallops, calamari, with brussels sprouts and bell peppers.\nTruthfully I dislike this dish, what I had in mind, it was going to be similar with Italian squid ink pasta, except they're using chinese noodle. However, what we had was totally different with what I had in mind. The taste itself, wow, underrated. I feel like eating regular chinese noodle in a fancy restaurant with premium price. Lack of flavor, portion is enough for two people, and this dish costs $18 exclude tax and tip.\n\n2. We also ordered Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles (\u91ce\u8c6c\u5200\u526a\u9eba) $16. The dish was originally for my kids. I requested to substitute the mushrooms with chicken. The veggies it has bean sprouts, scallions only. Again, they were serving this dish with a finger cut size noodle. It was easy for the kids to stab it with forks, but again, this second noodle dish lack of flavor. It even almost tasted the same with the first noodle dish we ordered (the squid ink noodle).\n\nFor the drink we ordered milk jasmine tea, it was just okay. \n\nTo sum it up; \nThis would be an American Chinese restaurant that has fancy decoration and located prime inside the Westfield Mall. It may be your dining destination if you are \n1. Never adventure in Chinese cuisine\n2. Going to the mall is your one stop destination where you want to shop and have lunch at the same time.\n3.

If you don't know him, this guy can pay debone an entire chicken with a meat cleaver in less than 20secs. Tons of cooking shows over the years, one thing that keeps playing in my damn head is that stupid song associated with the make-shift flash mob commercial for Granite Expo (Martin Yan LOVES Granite Expo btw). Anyway, I've been a little reluctant to try this spot (a little bit because of that tv commercial, a little bit because of the location inside the Westfield Shopping center). In addition, I'm spoiled because my better half is Chinese from Taiwan and her mom can bang out the \"super authentic/non-American-ized\" menu. All I can say is.. I've been shortchanging myself. This is not \"upscalemall food! \n\nFOOD: Since it was our first time, we wanted to try a wide scope of the menu. Loved loved loved the \"Bang-Bang Chicken Wings\" (6 for $9) & \"Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders\" (2 for $8); only comment here, & this is my palate mind you, is that I didn't get the smoked flavor. I also wish there was a little more belly since there's only two per order. / Moving onto the Entrees, we ordered the \"Wok Seared Beef\" on arugula ($20). This was super tasty, but lots of arugula. We also ordered the \"Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood\" ($18) which was beyond good, as well as the \"Yang Zhou Fried Rice\" ($11); a little more pork please.. Rounding up the mains were two more: something from the \"specials\" for the night and a house-hold staple. The \"Eggplant Clay Pot with tofu and veggies\" ($12) was good, but the winner for the night was the \"Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp w walnuts, cumbers and wasabi\" ($23); just enough bite from the wasabi to open your nasal passages. Dessert: Sugar Puffs w. chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, raspberry coulis (5 for $8).. Just the right amount. \n\nSERVICE: It's Monday night @ 7pm and the place is packed due to all the foot traffic from Oracle World down the street. Here I was thinking it would be easy/breezy/quiet to celebrate my wife's bday. Wrong. But here's where the surprises started. I mentioned that we were celebrating a bday in the OpenTable reservation and wanted a low-traffic spot in the restaurant to chow & enjoy each other's company. The hostess gets us in the perfect spot; close to the kitchen, but far enough away from the large group section. (Win). Then the shift manager Daniel comes up and hands us 2 comp glasses of bubbles and a bday card signed by everyone working that night. (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I mean seriously, who does that anymore..). Now that is a testament to a smart manager going \"above and beyond\". Things like our water glasses were always filled when they hit the 1/2 way mark; An informed server that could provide suggestions and tell me why; Our dishes served hot and together, or one right after another. These actions aren't just reserved for dining at Gary Danko or Boulevard, they are the result of actions associated with a true service mentality and phenomenal venue management. (I'm speaking about Daniel). \n\nPRICE: This is San Francisco. Not much I can say that anyone reading this review will be shocked about when it comes to the price point for menu items. One thing to factor is to have an understanding of the \"cost\" per plate for the house -vs- menu price. An indicator is not only the overall portion for the order, but the amount of the premium element (how much beef to amount of arugula / how much seafood to noodles to veggies / how many shrimp to cumbers / how much pork in the rice, etc...). That being said, the price point for each item was affordable, but the main items were all a little light. Probably because of the rent they have to pay, which I'm sure is insane. \n\nAMBIANCE: This is where you're teetering on inside/outside dining that's not actually \"outside\". A few tables along the perimeter of the restaurant which you need to navigate to reach the check-in station. Nice bar along the right side, while a open kitchen layout with counter seating. Nice blend of 2 and 4 tops with very limited number of booths (which I highly recommend if you can get them). There's an overflow room in the back which is great larger groups, but be prepared to talk loud. Well lit, and spaced out so you're not rubbing elbows when you go for your napkin. All in all, a comfortable dining experience where I could have a conversation, sitting in a booth mind you. \n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a stickler when it comes to eating out. I cook, so I know.

(; With such low expectations, I was definitely in for a pleasant surprise (especially after finding out M.Y. stood for Martin Yan)!\n\nThis is not your typical hole-in-the-wall, bad-service Chinese restaurant. In fact, far from it! Upon entering through the front, one of their hosts greeted me by my name when I told him that I was meeting two former colleagues for dinner and then he proceeded to escort me to the table. My immediate thought was: 'Whoa! What just happened here?! What kind of Chinese restaurant is this?!' \n\nAs we walked through the restaurant, the second most striking difference was their d\u00e9cor; it was sleek and modern yet elegant and tactful. Not only was each table covered with white, fancy-looking linens, but each table was also decorated with classy dinnerware. Needless to say, I was impressed by their exceptional customer service and decor, especially since I'm so used to the negligent customer service I receive from most Asian restaurants.\n\nThough the menu is reminiscent of your typical Chinese restaurant, it won't come out looking like your ordinary Chinese food. All of the dishes that we ordered were creatively designed to include many bright-colored food and beautifully arranged on modern plates or bowls. The food presentation was absolutely amazing! It certainly deserves a picture-taking moment.\n\nTheir food tastes just as delicious as they look!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish! It's absolutely delicious.\n\n(Note: When they presented us with this dish we were confused and thought they had given us the wrong dish because we were expecting to see long noodle strands. So, imagine our surprise when we saw short, dark, doughy-looking pieces of something that looked really foreign to us. Yes, those foreign things are in fact the squid ink noodles.)\n\n+Stir Fried Green Beans: These crunchy green beans are saut\u00e9ed in a light, somewhat spicy sauce, and are a wonderful complement to the entr\u00e9e dishes we ordered.\n+Kung Pao Chicken: This dish includes a combination of stir-fried chicken, jalape\u00f1o, peanuts, and crunchy red dried peppers. The crunchy red dried peppers will surprise you!\n+Forbidden Rice: This is a combination of red rice, brown rice, barley, and wolfberries. With so much flavor and texture packed in this rice dish, it certainly didn't taste like my usual, healthy brown rice dish. Definitely a nice addition to the other dishes!\n+Sugar Egg Puffs: Four huge egg puffs filled with a custard cream filling served with three different kinds of sauces, including dark chocolate, vanilla bean Chantilly cr\u00e8me, and raspberry coulis.

China delivers on that front in spades.\n\nMy cousin flew in and after nearly a full week of fancy eating (e.g.: Napa Valley right after the 6.0 quake, even) decided that she wanted to try Chinese.  After all San Francisco is a Chinese city too.  \n\nAnyway I thought about where I could take her and honestly, within city limits, there was nothing that excited me.  But I thought to myself that maybe the novelty of that Martin Yan place could ease the painful fact that the Chinese food scene in SF is mostly embarrassingly bad restaurants.  In fact the Martin Yan brand was what prevented me from even trying it out when it first opened -- I thought it was all fancied up fake Chinese food (yeah, I've lived in the East Asia long enough to earn the snob points on food authenticity... so there!).  Heaven forgive me for being so wrong about staying away from M.Y. China for so long.\n\nM.Y. China is not only authentic, it is how real Cantonese food should taste like.  Here is why:\n\nWe started with the Crispy Organic Tofu: beautiful silken texture within a golden crust that \"grabs\" on to the proper amount of seasoning with subtle hints of the jalapeno.\n\nBeef Hand-Pulled Noodles Soup:  full of flavours. I know, another reviewer has found this too sweet but I think it's just by a touch.  The ribs were tender and moist, not jerky-like as in other establishments.  Most importantly the ribs were bursting with flavours.  The use of ribs here is a departure from the traditional cut used for this dish which is shanks -- beef shanks have a layer of silverskin that, if not removed, imparts a \"offally\" taste to the broth and many restaurants don't bother with removing it.  I understand, it's fiddly and labour intensive.  Which is why short ribs are a genius work around.  I, myself, use a chuck cut for this dish.\n\nVenison Chow Fun: I cannot say enough about this one.  The \"wok breath\" shone through like nothing else.  This is a masterful, take-no-prisoner, artistic and technical tour de force.  The Fun retained the proper \"pull\", a texture hard to describe, you just have to try it, with the requisite smokey flavour accompanied by the also smokey crunch of the mung bean sprouts -- the sprouts were \"kissed\" by the very hot wok just enough.  The venison, almost a side note since the chow fun part was so spectacular, was tender and cut into small cubes.  Like the practice of Kung Fu, the wok \"chi\"/breath can only be wielded by a true Shifu (not that red panda in the cartoon but a true master).\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots: the freshness comes through without being overpowered by the garlic (other restaurants doing this dish falls down on this dish in part for the still raw garlic flavour).  One can tell from the texture that it meets the \"shoots\" definition.  Shoots are \"young\", tender greens.  You don't necessarily get this level of tenderness at other restaurants serving this dish.  In addition, unlike many other restaurants that keep over-using the word \"fresh\"  (can't taste it... ) the Shifu/Chef actually let the freshness showcase itself in this dish.  You can actually taste that freshness.\n\nFinally we finished our meal with the Lychee Panna Cotta: again, the flavour of the Lychee shone through both in the panna cotta itself and the granita sprinkled on top.  I don't know how the dessert chef managed to concentrate so much Lychee-ness into the Panna Cotta, it's more than just using chunks of the fruit.  It tastes as if the dish was somehow spritzed with a pure perfume of the Lychee essence.\n\nDrinks: Tanqueray Martini extra dry, I emphasized \"super extra dry\" with a twist -- waitress thought I said Daiquiri Martini (what in the world is that?) is not bad but not chilled or dry enough but overall good enough.  A little stingy with the portion... I think.  I also had a glass of the  Gewrutzstraminer, Lafken 2011 (Chile) a little too sweet for my palate but a fine white to complement the meal anyway.\n\nNote to bartender: try using a perfume spritzer bottle to spritz the vermouth (best to use Noilly Prat) on the outside of the martini glass.  Extra dry in my opinion is for olfactory enjoyment, not quite for gustatory enjoyment.  Also the lemon peel oil need to be squeezed out and rubbed on the rim a bit more.\n\nService: very courteous, just slightly understaffed, I think?  We had to remind a server for some request (I forgot what) once.\n\nM.Y. China is a seriously good restaurant.  I haven't had such spectacular Chinese food (or other types of cuisine) in a long time.  While the dishes we ordered are considered street food in East Asia but they are street food done uncompromisingly properly.  Sometimes I think it's even difficult to find this level of care and technical flair in East Asia anymore.\n\nWell done Martin Yan!  Well done M.Y.

He is not a fan of most Chinese restaurants as he thinks most of them do not use not the highest quality of ingredients.  I'm happy to report that he really enjoyed our dining experience here.  He even said he'd like to return and try other dishes!\n\nThe hostess thanked us for taking the time to make a reservation when she seated us on one of their outside tables.  She said it gets really busy there on Friday nights.  When we arrived, there were quite a number of people at the bar area already having a drink and eating during Happy Hour, which is from 3-6 pm.   We perused the menu which was nice and manageable, not super long like most Chinese restaurants.  We ordered the following:\n\nSeafood Dumpling -- one of the best I've had.  The scallops and shrimp were perfectly cooked and they were enveloped in a medium thin spinach wrapper.  The sauce was so good!  I should have had the server leave the leftover sauce, so I we could have poured some on our rice!\n\nTea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders -- It's not as good as The Chairman, but it was good.  I think a little bit more sauce on it would have made it better.  The pork was tender and flavorful.\n\nSeven Spice Pork Ribs with Chili and Thai Basil -- This was our favorite dish!!!!  I was so happy that it was not the sticky mess that I've seen and had in other restaurants!  These ribs were fork tender, so they have been slow cooked, and they had been fried and dusted with a coating of spices and chili.  OMG!  The thai basil is more than a garnish.  It really added more flavor to the pork!  It was a generous serving of 5 large ribs.  \n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles -- Again, another good dish.  Perfect accompaniment to the bold flavors of the Pork Ribs dish.  Noodles were perfectly cooked and was not swimming in sauce.\n\nSugar Egg Puffs with Chantilly Cream, Chocolate Sauce and Raspberry Coulis -- perfect ending to a filling dinner.  The puffs were truly light and eggy!  My only complain is I wanted more Chantilly Cream! \n\nFor beverages, my husband had a glass of a dry Sauvignon Blanc from Charles Krug, and I had a glass of the Under the Bronze Bell cocktail.  St. Germaine and The King's Ginger are two of my favorite liquer, so I had to get this cocktail.  Yum!  We will definitely be back!

If you're a fan of YAN CAN COOK on PBS (my parents used to watch this all the time), I wouldn't set your expectations SUPER high. I feel like this was on par with many other Chinese restaurants I've been to (except the whole time I was there, my friends and I were the only Asian people I saw in the restaurant, everyone else was a white family....) You could probably find food that is just as good at a cheaper Chinese place but the vibes might not be as classy or fusion feeling. I think the mood of the restaurant fit the setting of the celebration I was participating in, but I wouldn't come here for a meal with my family or just casually, because I think I could get a better deal somewhere else. That being said, the food wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't amazing.\n\nLocated in FiDi, it's a really annoying place that a lot of people don't like going to. I recommend taking Bart to Powell and it's a 900 ft walk to get to the mall, then take the escalators up to the 4th floor to find the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant has a cute outside area that you can get happy hour drinks and small bites if you're waiting for your reservation (or scare your friend if he's sitting with his back away from the restaurant). \n\nWhen a few more people form our huge party came, they sat us in this area in front of the kitchen (where it was very hot actually) while we ordered happy hour drinks. I got the buddha breeze, which was very tasty and probably my favorite thing I consumed that entire night.\n\nOur party of 20+ slit up into a few tables, so I shared the following with 3 other people:\n- wok seared beef (on top of arugula, this was VERY good - probably the only thing I thought was really worth ordering actually)\n- yang zhou fried rice (straightforward, what you think fried rice would look and taste like)\n- Black Pepper Glazed Snapper and Tofu (had eggplant that was decent)\n- HK crispy noodle with chicken\n\nThe food was average to me, but it could be because I had higher expectations. I would come again if my friends absolutely wanted to come, but the trouble it takes to get out here from the East Bay, price, and quality of food, I would only give it 3 stars. Also it's unfortunate that their happy hour drinks don't continue on the dinner menu at a more expensive price, because the buddha breeze was really good but is only on the HH menu.\n\nApologies for no pics, was too caught up in the celebration haha.

China - Martin Yan's China - was a nice discovery for us.\n\nMy husband and I came to San Francisco for the 2018 Bay to Breakers last weekend. We had eaten way too many times in Chinatown on previous trips to the city. This time, we wanted to try some place new. The manager at Hotel Zelos recommended M.Y. China. \n\nThe manager's recommendation turned out to be a real treat. M.Y. China is located in the vicinity of our hotel near Union Square. The walk from hotel to restaurant is less than 15 minutes. We came here twice in a span of 3 days.\n\nFirst Visit May 19, 2018\n\nThree of us came shortly after 5:00 on Saturday for dinner. There was no line. We were quickly seated at a table just outside the main entrance. The view from our table was amazing. Yes, we were dining on the 4th floor of the busy Westfield San Francisco Centre, but as we pan our surroundings, we didn't get much of the hectic vibes at all.\n\nWe ordered Wok Seared Beef, Grandma's Gai Lan, Steamed Tofu & Portobello and brown rice. \n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Aromatic arugula enhanced the flavors of the the meat. Loved the slightly chewy, yet tender, beef.  \n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Lightly seasoned. Saut\u00e9ed the way my Mom used to. Loved the Chinese sausage.\n* Steamed Tofu & Portobello - Beautiful presentation. Tofu was silky smooth, very fresh. Loved the scallion-ginger sauce \n* Brown Rice - Perfect accompaniment for the dishes. Loved the texture. \n\nSecond Visit Monday, May 21, 2018\n\nWe were initially concerned about the choice of M.Y. China for our lunch for 5 because one of our guests is a vegetarian. But it turned out that there were quite a few dishes that would work. We ordered 6 dishes to share, including 3 vegetarian ones.\n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Tasted just as delicious as Saturday's, but the beef didn't look as appetizing. Presentation a little off.\n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Every bit as good as Saturday's. Fresh gai lan, lean lap cheong. Loved it.\n* Garlic Pea Shoots - Vegetarian. This was a hit. Fresh and tender. Seasoned just right.\n* Eggplant & Tofu Clay Pot - Vegetarian. Loved the flavor of basil and black pepper sauce.\n* Tempeh Sliders (2 orders) - Vegetarian. Nicely garnished with pickled daikon and cilantro.\n* Roasted Chicken - Excellent. Crispy skin, tender meat. Didn't even need the seasoned dipping salt. Easily our favorite for this lunch.\n* Brown Rice - Very good. Nice to find brown rice in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nOur overall impression:\n\n* Food - Excellent, as expected of the renown Chef Martin Yan.\n* Service - Just okay. Saturday server seemed to rush us when there wasn't a crowd waiting to be seated. Service was better on Monday.\n* Price - Reasonable for a good San Francisco restaurant.\n* Location - Convenient. Accessible by public transportation. No need to drive and fight downtown traffic.\n\nIn summary, all 5 of us enjoyed dining here, although there were comments about the dishes showing up lukewarm, not hot. The gai lan, for example, was served already cold. That was disappointing.\n\nIt's a solid 4-Stars for M.Y. China for both of our visits. We'll be here again on our next trip to San Francisco. This time, we'll inquire about the secret Chinese menu mentioned in one of the Yelp reviews. We'll also try the popular Dim Sum Sampler and the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.\n\nA final note: I don't know what management can do about screaming kid(s), if anything. On Saturday, there was a grandma, mom and a young kid seated at the table cater-cornered to ours. The kid was screaming repeatedly. At one point, she got on top of the table. She  pulled on a plate, dropped and shattered it on the floor. Her screaming became piercing. It was impossible to carry on a normal conversation.

China is a collaboration between Martin Yan (television cooking show host, local personality) and Koi Palace (famed restaurant with locations in the Peninsula, East Bay, and South Bay).  It sits atop the Dome of the Westfield San Francisco Centre and reveals a grand plan to not only have top shopping destinations and brands, but also renovated food courts and sit-down offerings (Din Tai Fung at Westfield Valley Faire, M.Y. China at Westfield SF Centre).  \n\nWhile purists will likely find faults with the modern interpretations and execution of Chinese classics, many mall demographic people will be happy with the modern and clean decor, spacious seating, and elevated cuisine compared to either the mall food courts of past or even of the area.  \n\nTourists visiting the area could easily head to the Sunset or Richmond district or even find Thai or Vietnamese fare in the Tenderloin that would both be cheaper and more delicious, but it's not likely it would be as comfortable.  \n\nWe ordered a broad selection of the menu and were happy with our diverse choices and glad at the professional service and their ability to sit a large party on a busy weekend with little notice.  Honestly, I'd say the execution is the low or middle part of the menu and that our misses were at the high end.  Our order:\n\nHot and Sour Soup - $12.  More like hot and very sour soup.  I think the waiter overheard me saying this and brought another complimentary bowl by later, but it was more of the same....very sour and more chili oil so very hot.  Pass.\n\nBeef Pulled Noodle Soup - $15.  Solid.  Tender beef, tasty bok choy and round standard noodles.  The soup broth was flavorful and piping hot.\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodles with Chicken XO - $16.  Another solid dish.  Nicely crispy fried noodles topped with plentiful sauce and large chunks of tender, but white meat chicken.  Not much XO but I enjoyed it.  \n\nWok Seared Beef - $19.  Tender filets of beef with a touch of sichuan peppercorns.  A bit odd paired with bitter arugula, but the dish had a nice flavor.  \n\nCrispy Whole Rockfish - $32.  Heading into the weaker part of the menu.  I should have read the description carefully, but I expected whole large pieces of rockfish stir fried with sauce.  Instead, it was a deep fried entire rockfish fried to a very crispy finish and topped with a nice sauce.  While the presentation wasn't as expected (it's very similar to a popular Americanized Chef Chu dish in Los Altos ), I was still game.  I soon realized why they deep fried it for so long.  In short, it probably wasn't swimming recently. \n\nSalted Egg Dungeness Crab - $48.  This is a classic dish and I was hoping for a tasty rendition.  The salted egg coating was decent, but again, like the fish, the crab quality, despite dungeness crab season opening late this year, wasn't up to par.  I'm used to going to places with seafood tanks (Koi Palace, Yum's Bistro, etc.) so I should have known.  Disappointing at the price point.  \n\nOverall, we had a solid meal at M.Y. China.  There's much to like with the decor, service, and location, especially if you're a tourist visiting SF or simply doing some shopping in SoMa.  Chinese cuisine in these parts is going to be either expensive (Hakkasan, Crystal Jade) or mediocre or some combination of both.  If you stick to the noodle dishes and small plates, you'll do fine.

If you don't know him, this guy can pay debone an entire chicken with a meat cleaver in less than 20secs. Tons of cooking shows over the years, one thing that keeps playing in my damn head is that stupid song associated with the make-shift flash mob commercial for Granite Expo (Martin Yan LOVES Granite Expo btw). Anyway, I've been a little reluctant to try this spot (a little bit because of that tv commercial, a little bit because of the location inside the Westfield Shopping center). In addition, I'm spoiled because my better half is Chinese from Taiwan and her mom can bang out the \"super authentic/non-American-ized\" menu. All I can say is.. I've been shortchanging myself. This is not \"upscalemall food! \n\nFOOD: Since it was our first time, we wanted to try a wide scope of the menu. Loved loved loved the \"Bang-Bang Chicken Wings\" (6 for $9) & \"Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders\" (2 for $8); only comment here, & this is my palate mind you, is that I didn't get the smoked flavor. I also wish there was a little more belly since there's only two per order. / Moving onto the Entrees, we ordered the \"Wok Seared Beef\" on arugula ($20). This was super tasty, but lots of arugula. We also ordered the \"Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood\" ($18) which was beyond good, as well as the \"Yang Zhou Fried Rice\" ($11); a little more pork please.. Rounding up the mains were two more: something from the \"specials\" for the night and a house-hold staple. The \"Eggplant Clay Pot with tofu and veggies\" ($12) was good, but the winner for the night was the \"Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp w walnuts, cumbers and wasabi\" ($23); just enough bite from the wasabi to open your nasal passages. Dessert: Sugar Puffs w. chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, raspberry coulis (5 for $8).. Just the right amount. \n\nSERVICE: It's Monday night @ 7pm and the place is packed due to all the foot traffic from Oracle World down the street. Here I was thinking it would be easy/breezy/quiet to celebrate my wife's bday. Wrong. But here's where the surprises started. I mentioned that we were celebrating a bday in the OpenTable reservation and wanted a low-traffic spot in the restaurant to chow & enjoy each other's company. The hostess gets us in the perfect spot; close to the kitchen, but far enough away from the large group section. (Win). Then the shift manager Daniel comes up and hands us 2 comp glasses of bubbles and a bday card signed by everyone working that night. (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I mean seriously, who does that anymore..). Now that is a testament to a smart manager going \"above and beyond\". Things like our water glasses were always filled when they hit the 1/2 way mark; An informed server that could provide suggestions and tell me why; Our dishes served hot and together, or one right after another. These actions aren't just reserved for dining at Gary Danko or Boulevard, they are the result of actions associated with a true service mentality and phenomenal venue management. (I'm speaking about Daniel). \n\nPRICE: This is San Francisco. Not much I can say that anyone reading this review will be shocked about when it comes to the price point for menu items. One thing to factor is to have an understanding of the \"cost\" per plate for the house -vs- menu price. An indicator is not only the overall portion for the order, but the amount of the premium element (how much beef to amount of arugula / how much seafood to noodles to veggies / how many shrimp to cumbers / how much pork in the rice, etc...). That being said, the price point for each item was affordable, but the main items were all a little light. Probably because of the rent they have to pay, which I'm sure is insane. \n\nAMBIANCE: This is where you're teetering on inside/outside dining that's not actually \"outside\". A few tables along the perimeter of the restaurant which you need to navigate to reach the check-in station. Nice bar along the right side, while a open kitchen layout with counter seating. Nice blend of 2 and 4 tops with very limited number of booths (which I highly recommend if you can get them). There's an overflow room in the back which is great larger groups, but be prepared to talk loud. Well lit, and spaced out so you're not rubbing elbows when you go for your napkin. All in all, a comfortable dining experience where I could have a conversation, sitting in a booth mind you. \n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a stickler when it comes to eating out. I cook, so I know.

Overall, it was underwhelming.  The Shu Mai was actually pretty good and the Har Gow and Multi Grain Rice were okay.  The two baos were pretty \"meh\" though and I didn't care much for the Seafood Dumpling.\n\n- WOK SEARED BEEF FILET with Sichuan Peppercorns on a bed of Arugula...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m-y-china-san-francisco-2#M1rnqAkCUOFl_f_VHfPGtg)\nEasily my favorite dish.  I feared the meat would be tough, but each piece was both tender and flavorful.  The beef combined really well with the arugula too.\n\nAs far as the prices go, it's undeniably higher here than at other Chinese restaurants in SF.  However, I'd be reluctant to say M.Y. China is \"overpriced\" since both the quality of the ingredients and the service are much better.  Plus, it's somewhat expected given the name above the door and their location (it is Union Square).\n\nMoney aside, the food itself was the bigger issue for me.  While the beef and dumpling dishes were good, the other two didn't do much for me.  Nothing bad mind you, but nothing amazing.

For Chinese New Year my family and I wanted to celebrate at R&G lounge, but unfortunately it was completely booked up the whole night. So we settled on with MY China instead. We made reservations online using OpenTable, and surprisingly it was completely open ended.\n\nArriving at the restaurant 15 minutes early, we were in for a different surprise. The restaurant was packed and there was no available seating inside the restaurant. We asked about our reservation for 7:15. The hostess asked us to please wait a moment. From my quick understanding it seems they were inundated with last minute guests and did not bother to reserve seating for the guests who made reservations. An automatic star downgrade in my book. The hostess made us wait for another 15 minutes. We asked again about our table, and she said oh what is your name? SMH, we've been standing here for 15 minutes and we just talked to you. They in between seated a table of 8 people who had no reservations. They offered to put us at a table out of the way and on the outside, after we complained lightly about getting the 5 minute wait end around.\n\nWith that out of the way, the service was a lot better. Our waitor Bolo, did a great job discussing the menu with us and treated us with great care. The food was all delivered to our table very quickly. Can't fault that table service.\n\nThe food itself was reasonable, but not spectacular or of great value. We had the following dishes:\n\n+ Steamed Seasonal Fish - ***/5 - The portion was a bit too small. We wanted a whole fish with the head and tail in tact specifically for Chinese New Year, but they could not accommodate this because we were not a table of 6.\n+ Wok Seared Beef - ***/5 - Pretty standard wasn't absolutely wowing me.\n+ Whole Crispy Roast Chicken - ****/5 - pretty decently cooked, very moist cuts and everything tasted great, they even provided 5 spice dipping powder on the side.\n+ Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles - **/5 - not a fan of this dish, not enough chunks of the boar meat, and the noodles were a bit odd in texture.\n+ Garlic Pea Shoots (Dau Miu) - ****/5 - pretty simple, nicely done, and at standard.\n\nOn the outside, the restaurant looks very extravagant, modern and upscale. It just did not live up to the expectation that I had in terms of quality for the value. I understand that the place they are in is high rent for the sq/space.

So the inevitable happened; we were flagging down a very flustered waiter who was paying attention to the 2 large parties but we were flagging down Bussers just to get some water 10 minutes in.

The Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) was really undercooked as was the Chinese Sausage that comes with it.\n\nA different kind of problem we had with the meal was  that the \"Crispy Organic Tofu\" and the \"Salt and Pepper Chicken wings\" are heavily doused with the same exact seasoning, and with no indication from the menu or our waiter. On the Tofu we found it too spicy for the subtle protein (though we like really hot food), and it didn't add anything to the Wings, which were unlike any we have had before with the same title.  And we always get \"The Wings\" when we go out!\n\nThe Fried Rice is good though and was the saving grace of the meal but that's not really a compliment.

China Mai Tai was pretty tasty, and had a kick to it...be careful if you order too many of these as they were pretty powerful.\n\nDim Sum - Our waiter recommended the Pork & Crab juicy dumplings - these were really good interesting combination of flavors- - maybe a little pricey, but crab is not cheap.  \n\nWe split the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup - easily enough for two people, but warning - these noodles are really long...and you will look like an episode from I LOVE LUCY where you need scissors to cut the noodles to get into your bowl...they are LONG.

It really is a pleasant looking restaurant and the aesthetics of the open-ish kitchen are also nice as you walk in. The hostess led us to a less-than-desirable table by the hallway to the bathroom (yes, we did have reservations for 4 through OpenTable), and upon asking to be re-seated at a number of other open tables were told they were all also \"reserved\". Not a big deal but more on this later (you can probably guess what happened). \n\nThe service to start was prompt, and the waitress seemed personable and took our orders. We elected to go with 2 Hot & Sour Soups, 2 Westlake Wonton Soups, the Beijing Beef Cut Noodles, Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, Pork Sliders, Chairman Mao's Chicken, and Wok Seared Beef Filet. The first red flag should have been when our waitress took our order mentally, and then returned a minute later to double-check which entree our friends had ordered (there's a reason why servers write it down)\n\nThe soups came out quickly, litteraly about 2 minutes after the waitress \"confirmed\" our order- I got the Hot & Sour, which I am a huge fan of at 99% of Chinese restaurants. Not this one. At first glance I would tell something was wrong... the soup wasn't of its traditional brown hue but concentrated very heavily with a vibrant red. One taste of the soup told me enough- it tasted like a thick paste mixed with Sriracha. Literally inedible and probably the worst thing I've tasted in a long, long time. I alerted our waitress to send the soup back (either this is the worst recipe on the planet or the chef of the night dumped way too much hot sauce into the soup) and request a bowl of the Westlake instead. She snatched the bowl off the table like I had personally offended her, and stormed off to the kitchen. She then disappeared for no-less than 15 minutes and forced us to ask two other different servers where our soup was (\"Coming right out\"). The replacement bowl of the Wonton soup made it out, followed 30 seconds later by our noodles and entrees. Great. \n\nThe soup itself- bland. Tasted like water, egg whites, and chives with two wontons. Had to dump a whole ramekin of Soy Sauce into the soup to get through it. Not the worst I've had, not even comparable to the Hot-and-Sour atrocity, but yet bland none the less.\n\nAs my party started to eat the entrees as I was still finishing my soup, I got the sense they were underwhelmed with the food. Wow, was that an understatement.\n\nThe Wok Seared Filet ($18) was one of the worst beef dishes I've ever tasted in my life. I don't know whose bright idea it is to take a \"Filet\", pound it out like a Flank Steak, and then serve it essentially deep fried in a tasteless sauce but it's just plain bad. The beef has some spice, but absolutely no flavor whatsoever. After chewing through two pieces (I've had sirloin steaks from Chinese fast food places that's more tender) I was done with this dish. \n\nNext up was the Chairman Mao's Chicken ($16). It's essentially five pieces of chicken deep-fried in a basket with no seasoning or sauce. They give you two ramekins of \"sweet and spicy\" sauce but it's barely enough to cover one piece of the tasteless fried chicken. I wouldn't be surprised if the chefs here (at least that evening) has never seen a salt or pepper shaker. \n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($14)- this was the only okay dish on the table. The noodles were tasty, however the Wild Boar wasn't very flavorful (no seasoning, big surprise...) and prepared poorly (so much gristle.. yuck!)\n\nBeijing Knife Cut Noodles ($12) - Probably just as disappointing on par with the Hot and Sour Soup and \"Filet\". The dish looked like a bowl of Top Ramen after the served \"mixed\" it together and had a weird, sweet hint to it. \n\nPork Belly Sliders - Never came, waitress probably \"forgot\" since she took our order in her head.  The rest of the meal and service was so laughable we didn't even ask about it. \n\nOverall- this is probably the worst \"Chinese\" place I've ever encountered in my lifetime. Everyone in our party was displeased and left us wishing we had made the trek out to somewhere such as San Tung instead. The food was so bland it makes airplane cuisine sound appealing. To top it off- the vacant tables that we had requested (\"Sorry those are reserved\") were still sitting empty 2 hours later. \n\nIf you're into foo-foo fancy looking expensive \"Chinese\" food that tastes like cardboard this is the place for you. \n\nMy recommendation- save about $20/head and go to Panda Express downstairs instead if you're really craving Asian food.  They will actually put some thought into seasoning your food and the person serving you probably won't act like they take it personally if you don't like something.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-10-01"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Wok Seared Beef Filet, Honey Glazed BBQ Pork, Peking Roast Duck, Whole Wheat Potstickers, and the Spicy Seafood Dumplings.

Some of the tables are quite close to one another, so movement can be a tiny bit difficult. We ordered several dishes to share among us. \n\nHoney glazed walnut shrimp - there is wasabi flavoring on the shrimp, an unconventional addition. I'm not a big fan of wasabi flavor, so I didn't like it very much. \n\nLava custard buns - the custard inside was hot and was like a thick liquid just like lava. Careful about burning your tongue. It tasted pretty good. \n\nBeijing knife cut noodles - the noodles are super good. There's good flavor and the noodles are a bit chewy.\n\nFried chicken wings - not bad.

If you don't know him, this guy can pay debone an entire chicken with a meat cleaver in less than 20secs. Tons of cooking shows over the years, one thing that keeps playing in my damn head is that stupid song associated with the make-shift flash mob commercial for Granite Expo (Martin Yan LOVES Granite Expo btw). Anyway, I've been a little reluctant to try this spot (a little bit because of that tv commercial, a little bit because of the location inside the Westfield Shopping center). In addition, I'm spoiled because my better half is Chinese from Taiwan and her mom can bang out the \"super authentic/non-American-ized\" menu. All I can say is.. I've been shortchanging myself. This is not \"upscalemall food! \n\nFOOD: Since it was our first time, we wanted to try a wide scope of the menu. Loved loved loved the \"Bang-Bang Chicken Wings\" (6 for $9) & \"Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders\" (2 for $8); only comment here, & this is my palate mind you, is that I didn't get the smoked flavor. I also wish there was a little more belly since there's only two per order. / Moving onto the Entrees, we ordered the \"Wok Seared Beef\" on arugula ($20). This was super tasty, but lots of arugula. We also ordered the \"Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood\" ($18) which was beyond good, as well as the \"Yang Zhou Fried Rice\" ($11); a little more pork please.. Rounding up the mains were two more: something from the \"specials\" for the night and a house-hold staple. The \"Eggplant Clay Pot with tofu and veggies\" ($12) was good, but the winner for the night was the \"Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp w walnuts, cumbers and wasabi\" ($23); just enough bite from the wasabi to open your nasal passages. Dessert: Sugar Puffs w. chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, raspberry coulis (5 for $8).. Just the right amount. \n\nSERVICE: It's Monday night @ 7pm and the place is packed due to all the foot traffic from Oracle World down the street. Here I was thinking it would be easy/breezy/quiet to celebrate my wife's bday. Wrong. But here's where the surprises started. I mentioned that we were celebrating a bday in the OpenTable reservation and wanted a low-traffic spot in the restaurant to chow & enjoy each other's company. The hostess gets us in the perfect spot; close to the kitchen, but far enough away from the large group section. (Win). Then the shift manager Daniel comes up and hands us 2 comp glasses of bubbles and a bday card signed by everyone working that night. (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I mean seriously, who does that anymore..). Now that is a testament to a smart manager going \"above and beyond\". Things like our water glasses were always filled when they hit the 1/2 way mark; An informed server that could provide suggestions and tell me why; Our dishes served hot and together, or one right after another. These actions aren't just reserved for dining at Gary Danko or Boulevard, they are the result of actions associated with a true service mentality and phenomenal venue management. (I'm speaking about Daniel). \n\nPRICE: This is San Francisco. Not much I can say that anyone reading this review will be shocked about when it comes to the price point for menu items. One thing to factor is to have an understanding of the \"cost\" per plate for the house -vs- menu price. An indicator is not only the overall portion for the order, but the amount of the premium element (how much beef to amount of arugula / how much seafood to noodles to veggies / how many shrimp to cumbers / how much pork in the rice, etc...). That being said, the price point for each item was affordable, but the main items were all a little light. Probably because of the rent they have to pay, which I'm sure is insane. \n\nAMBIANCE: This is where you're teetering on inside/outside dining that's not actually \"outside\". A few tables along the perimeter of the restaurant which you need to navigate to reach the check-in station. Nice bar along the right side, while a open kitchen layout with counter seating. Nice blend of 2 and 4 tops with very limited number of booths (which I highly recommend if you can get them). There's an overflow room in the back which is great larger groups, but be prepared to talk loud. Well lit, and spaced out so you're not rubbing elbows when you go for your napkin. All in all, a comfortable dining experience where I could have a conversation, sitting in a booth mind you. \n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a stickler when it comes to eating out. I cook, so I know. One of the BEST service and food experiences I've had in San Francisco in a very very very long time.

"], "author": "Nicole T.", "review": "The first thought is, really? A great (non-chain) restaurant in a mall? It's true. The energy of the place is incredible with the open faced kitchen where you can see the many chefs preparing everything by hand. Martin Yan was entertaining a group the night we were there, complete with camera crew so we got to see something special. The head chef, Tony, is one of the top chefs from China and he is incredibly warm as well as incredibly talented. We watched him make hand pulled noodles blindfolded. If you've ever seen this done, it's already a feat using your sight.\n\nDrinks:  Tasty and creative. There was a spicy drink called Fire in the Wok that I recommend if you want a little bite or something to fight off a cold. I enjoyed Under the Bronze Bell, a champagne drink mixed with ginger liquor and St. Germain Elderflower (and a touch of grenadine I think), named after the huge bell shipped from China that is now the centerpiece of the bar.\n\nI'm actually giving 4.5 stars. Half star goes away for our server not telling us we'd ordered too much food for our table of 8 even after we specifically asked her to let us know if we ordered too much. For starters, we could have done without duplicates of the dishes. It didn't help that there was some confusion among our group as to what people were ordering. But having said that, our server and the rest of the staff were outstanding.\n\nNow the upside to ordering all the food we had is that I can say there are SO many yummy things on the menu. \n\nDumplings: Wild boar, pork & crab, seafood, all were outstanding. I'm a huge fan of DTF and am waiting for the day one opens in the south bay (please let it be soon). The first two are served in traditional steam baskets and dramatically served in individual soup spoons (careful, they're hot!) and a slice of carrot. Downside is the carrot doesn't cover the whole surface area so the dumplings still tear open. Upside is the spoon catches all the delicous broth from the dumpling so you can enjoy it with the chewy perfection that is the skin.\n\nAvocado shrimp rolls: I could have skipped this one. Fresh ingredients but even with the peanut dipping sauce I was more interested in devouring other things.\n\nMu Shu tacos: Very generous helping for 2 tacos. Can easily feed 4 as an appetizer.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: One of our favorites, highly recommended.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Cold, so maybe not everyone is a fan, but these thinner noodles have lots of flavor and a little spice.\n\nHK Crispy Noodles: You can't go wrong with crispy noodles. =) Very traditional and one of my childhood favorites, the noodles around the outside are crispy and then soft in the middle under the sauce and toppings.\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp: This is delicious pretty much anywhere you go but these are great. Lightly glazed, not drowning in sauce.\n\nBok Choy: Simple, basic, and a good side that goes with everything.\n\nMapo Tofu: Great if you like silken tofu. Not so great if you prefer the texture of firmer tofu.\n\nForbidden Rice: You want to order it just for the name. But it doesn't disappoint. This was probably the dish that surprised everyone with all the flavor.\n\nTwo of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. Both were a big hit and happily devoured.\n\nLastly, we received a very cool dessert made by Tony. It was a large plate of very fine noodles fried and covered in sugar, strawberry syrup, and berries. It may sound strange but it was so light and delicious. It was almost like Chinese cotton candy.\n\nIn general, because the menu can be a little confusing portion-wise, the noodle and wok dishes can easily feed a table of 4. Even some of the sides like the bok choy and mapo tofu can feed up to 6 unless you want a generous portion of those items and don't plan on sampling other things.\n\nThis is a little far for me to visit all the time but I will definitely be back!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The honey glazed walnut shrimp is a must-have.

China is a collaboration between Martin Yan (television cooking show host, local personality) and Koi Palace (famed restaurant with locations in the Peninsula, East Bay, and South Bay).  It sits atop the Dome of the Westfield San Francisco Centre and reveals a grand plan to not only have top shopping destinations and brands, but also renovated food courts and sit-down offerings (Din Tai Fung at Westfield Valley Faire, M.Y. China at Westfield SF Centre).  \n\nWhile purists will likely find faults with the modern interpretations and execution of Chinese classics, many mall demographic people will be happy with the modern and clean decor, spacious seating, and elevated cuisine compared to either the mall food courts of past or even of the area.  \n\nTourists visiting the area could easily head to the Sunset or Richmond district or even find Thai or Vietnamese fare in the Tenderloin that would both be cheaper and more delicious, but it's not likely it would be as comfortable.  \n\nWe ordered a broad selection of the menu and were happy with our diverse choices and glad at the professional service and their ability to sit a large party on a busy weekend with little notice.  Honestly, I'd say the execution is the low or middle part of the menu and that our misses were at the high end.  Our order:\n\nHot and Sour Soup - $12.  More like hot and very sour soup.  I think the waiter overheard me saying this and brought another complimentary bowl by later, but it was more of the same....very sour and more chili oil so very hot.  Pass.\n\nBeef Pulled Noodle Soup - $15.  Solid.  Tender beef, tasty bok choy and round standard noodles.  The soup broth was flavorful and piping hot.\n\nHong Kong Crispy Noodles with Chicken XO - $16.  Another solid dish.  Nicely crispy fried noodles topped with plentiful sauce and large chunks of tender, but white meat chicken.  Not much XO but I enjoyed it.  \n\nWok Seared Beef - $19.  Tender filets of beef with a touch of sichuan peppercorns.  A bit odd paired with bitter arugula, but the dish had a nice flavor.  \n\nCrispy Whole Rockfish - $32.  Heading into the weaker part of the menu.  I should have read the description carefully, but I expected whole large pieces of rockfish stir fried with sauce.  Instead, it was a deep fried entire rockfish fried to a very crispy finish and topped with a nice sauce.  While the presentation wasn't as expected (it's very similar to a popular Americanized Chef Chu dish in Los Altos ), I was still game.  I soon realized why they deep fried it for so long.  In short, it probably wasn't swimming recently. \n\nSalted Egg Dungeness Crab - $48.  This is a classic dish and I was hoping for a tasty rendition.  The salted egg coating was decent, but again, like the fish, the crab quality, despite dungeness crab season opening late this year, wasn't up to par.  I'm used to going to places with seafood tanks (Koi Palace, Yum's Bistro, etc.) so I should have known.  Disappointing at the price point.  \n\nOverall, we had a solid meal at M.Y. China.  There's much to like with the decor, service, and location, especially if you're a tourist visiting SF or simply doing some shopping in SoMa.  Chinese cuisine in these parts is going to be either expensive (Hakkasan, Crystal Jade) or mediocre or some combination of both.  If you stick to the noodle dishes and small plates, you'll do fine.

I feel like this was on par with many other Chinese restaurants I've been to (except the whole time I was there, my friends and I were the only Asian people I saw in the restaurant, everyone else was a white family....) You could probably find food that is just as good at a cheaper Chinese place but the vibes might not be as classy or fusion feeling. I think the mood of the restaurant fit the setting of the celebration I was participating in, but I wouldn't come here for a meal with my family or just casually, because I think I could get a better deal somewhere else. That being said, the food wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't amazing.\n\nLocated in FiDi, it's a really annoying place that a lot of people don't like going to.

I got the buddha breeze, which was very tasty and probably my favorite thing I consumed that entire night.\n\nOur party of 20+ slit up into a few tables, so I shared the following with 3 other people:\n- wok seared beef (on top of arugula, this was VERY good - probably the only thing I thought was really worth ordering actually)\n- yang zhou fried rice (straightforward, what you think fried rice would look and taste like)\n- Black Pepper Glazed Snapper and Tofu (had eggplant that was decent)\n- HK crispy noodle with chicken\n\nThe food was average to me, but it could be because I had higher expectations. I would come again if my friends absolutely wanted to come, but the trouble it takes to get out here from the East Bay, price, and quality of food, I would only give it 3 stars. Also it's unfortunate that their happy hour drinks don't continue on the dinner menu at a more expensive price, because the buddha breeze was really good but is only on the HH menu.\n\nApologies for no pics, was too caught up in the celebration haha.

The sauce wasn't all that spicy nor all that salty, allowing the tofu to really shine as the star of the dish. The scallop fried rice, though simple in concept, was clearly prepared with a great amount of skill. The egg white was neither too firm nor too watery and same with the rice.

If you want to haul ass down the peninsula to Santa Clara and the like, yes you're going to find something better.  Here, they serve them steaming hot each in large oversized red ceramic spoons. The dumplings are adhered to the spoon with a piece of sticky flour, so don't try to pick them up, peel them off.  Just poke a hole and enjoy sipping and eating them from the serving spoon. They put a piece of cucumber on the bottom of each spoon that synergizes well with the oily soup.  Their other dim sum is decent, but their soup dumplings are the best over here.\n\nMain Dishes (meats, fish): I've tried and liked the Honey Glazed BBQ pork and  Tea Smoked Sea Bass.  Both dishes are very good, splurge on the sea bass if you're interested in seeing how fish can taste like fatty meat :3\n\nPeking Duck:  pass, go to excelsior's Beijing restaurant.

This one is actually a decent portion where two of us were able to get full.\n\n*Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders (2) \u8336\u9999\u8c6c\u8169\u5305 8\nProbably my favorite appetizer ever-perfectly steamed buns with just the right amount of tender pork belly and complimented with pickled daikon and veggies and a  slightly zesty peppercorn oil. I wish there were at least 3 of these included for the price though.\n\n*Honey Glazed BBQ Pork \u8702\u871c\u53c9\u71d2 10\nMy China's version of \"char sui\" and this one isn't the least bit fatty or chewy. It's thinly sliced, honey kissed and just PERFECT if you are into meat (which I rarely am but actually enjoy eating this) \n\n*Twin Scallops Fried Rice \u53cc\u8c9d\u7092\u98ef 10\nI know this is just fried rice but they do it so well in this case and you do taste some of those scallops.

But it is the opposite for Chinese people...so long as the food is first and foremost excellent, the rest do not matter.\" Basically a restaurant can splurge several fortunes into making a place look snazzy that would make cougars proud to be partaking in Happy Hour before dragging conquests back home for some happy endings post Happy Hour, but if  the entrees and main courses don't deliver, what is the point of eating there. \n\nLuckily for many of us in the SF Bay Area, MY China in a way has both, but done in a way that it satisfies everyone.\n\nI know what $trait$ Restaurant represents, and their approach I do not agree with.\n\nThis time round, I think I enjoyed the experience just a slight more than prior.\n\nWild boar lettuce cups (Appetizer) - this is a bit of a remix on the tried and true minced squab lettuce cups with hoisin sauce. The addtion of fried bean thread like vermicelli added an extra layer of crispy textures, and with the julienne wild boar that was nicely stir fried and juicy, made this a real winner. Two cups per order, enough to share. Would that be Two Girls One Cup, One Dude Two Cups? Dunno, but these B Cups were awesome. B for Boar, that is. \n\nWild boar scissor cut noodles - we sat near the counter and saw one of the kitchen staff carefully use scissors to cut a ball of dough. He was clearly taking his time, and each piece of noodle looked pretty thin. Thus we were guessing if he was practicing and whether we would get the trial art and craft project stir fried (and he seemed to be taking his time doing so, versus first visit when the scissor cut noodle chef was slicing and dicing the dough at breakneck pace). The decision to request \"less salt, less oil\" was a good one (although somehow it became no salt no oil for some lost in translation reason). This arrived piping hot and very nicely stir fried. It was almost like a properly done moo shoo (luckily not moo shoo poo poo, that's something else entirely like uhm... PF). And this is where it is crucial to kick things up a notch and get some house chili sauce, which definitely elevated this. In retrospect, I should have asked for some XO sauce to try. Definitely the Chinese version of Cinghiale pasta, but stir fried.\n\nHoney glazed BBQ pork (cha siu) - It's $10 a plate, and while you can get half a pound or a takeout box for that much at the run down roasties deli shop, it is always fun to try a plate of this at a high end restaurant. It's a good taste tester for the kitchen, and a very welcoming popular BBQ item (honey glazed BBQ pork, what is there not to like unless you are a meat hating hipster but craves bacon wrapped sausages once in a while?). Generally lean for the most part, yet each bite was tender and juicy all the way through. A very delicate marinade, although the final roasting process probably had a tad too sweet of a molasses splash. The best part? Picking up a random slice (closer to the edges) thinking it's all lean, and when you bite into it, there's a portion of fat that somehow crept in. It melts in your mouth like warm sweet butter and honey, and suddenly you feel like you were shot into the skies. Or akin to eating at your favorite sushi bar, and the chef gives you a run of the mill looking item, and when you eat it you discover there's toro, uni, and wagyu in it. So yeah, this cha siu is great...yet subtly pornographic...like reading a novel called \"50 Shades Of Pork\".   \n\nSo no, ordering BBQ pork appetizer plate at a nicer Cantonese Chinese restaurant during dinner, is not an unusual thing. We don't have restaurants like Tin Lung Heen in Hong Kong that take Spanish Iberico black pig and use premium cuts to make cha siu.l...so places like Koi Palace and even MYC offering something like this that may be above average for expats, and very decent according to \"King Of FOBenese Food\", ain't so bad.\n\nStir fried bok choy with salted fish - when this arrived, it was as if the veggies were quickly clear stir fried with very little to no oil, and was very bland. Turns out our waitress misheard my \"less salt less oil\" and thought we meant \"no salt no oil\", and the kitchen withheld the salted fish (which she said was oily). We had this taken back and what a difference it made afterwards. The salted fish quantity and enhancement was not strong, but did make the dish taste better. Was half the price of large pea sprout with garlic ($16), so if you want your greens on, this is a safe choice.\n\n4 dishes for two, came out to a shade over $50, which is not unreasonable for the location, quality, and to factor in d\u00e9cor and service. Plus you get some free shows of hand pulled noodles every now and then, plus scissor cutting of noodles.\n\nToo bad Martin wasn't in the house.

For Chinese New Year my family and I wanted to celebrate at R&G lounge, but unfortunately it was completely booked up the whole night. So we settled on with MY China instead. We made reservations online using OpenTable, and surprisingly it was completely open ended.\n\nArriving at the restaurant 15 minutes early, we were in for a different surprise. The restaurant was packed and there was no available seating inside the restaurant. We asked about our reservation for 7:15. The hostess asked us to please wait a moment. From my quick understanding it seems they were inundated with last minute guests and did not bother to reserve seating for the guests who made reservations. An automatic star downgrade in my book. The hostess made us wait for another 15 minutes. We asked again about our table, and she said oh what is your name? SMH, we've been standing here for 15 minutes and we just talked to you. They in between seated a table of 8 people who had no reservations. They offered to put us at a table out of the way and on the outside, after we complained lightly about getting the 5 minute wait end around.\n\nWith that out of the way, the service was a lot better. Our waitor Bolo, did a great job discussing the menu with us and treated us with great care. The food was all delivered to our table very quickly. Can't fault that table service.\n\nThe food itself was reasonable, but not spectacular or of great value. We had the following dishes:\n\n+ Steamed Seasonal Fish - ***/5 - The portion was a bit too small. We wanted a whole fish with the head and tail in tact specifically for Chinese New Year, but they could not accommodate this because we were not a table of 6.\n+ Wok Seared Beef - ***/5 - Pretty standard wasn't absolutely wowing me.\n+ Whole Crispy Roast Chicken - ****/5 - pretty decently cooked, very moist cuts and everything tasted great, they even provided 5 spice dipping powder on the side.\n+ Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles - **/5 - not a fan of this dish, not enough chunks of the boar meat, and the noodles were a bit odd in texture.\n+ Garlic Pea Shoots (Dau Miu) - ****/5 - pretty simple, nicely done, and at standard.\n\nOn the outside, the restaurant looks very extravagant, modern and upscale. It just did not live up to the expectation that I had in terms of quality for the value. I understand that the place they are in is high rent for the sq/space.

It was a very good deal.\n\nFor libations, we ordered a mai tai and a Stella Artois cider. The mai tai was yummy and very well made. The cider was smooth and complemented the duck beautifully.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the sugar puffs or Chinese donuts and the black sesame ice cream. The donuts were warm and came with chocolate sauce, raspberry coulis and sweetened whipped cream. The ice cream was delicious and the flavor was a nice change from the ubiquitous green tea. Both desserts were yummy. We loved the thick, rich chocolate sauce but the best thing was when we stuffed the donut with the ice cream.  \n\nThe food was very good, not transcendent, but very good. What put M.Y. China over the top was the kitchen staff. We were seated at the chef's table. It is a counter facing the wok station of the open kitchen. Now I don't like sitting with my back to a room. I don't know, maybe I was a gangster or gunslinger in another life. My initial wariness quickly gave way to delight as we watched the busy cooks chop, fry and assemble food for the restaurant. \n\nWatching the food being prepared was actually what persuaded us to order more than dessert. We saw a fresh duck being pulled from the fryer. The golden, glistening skin just seduced us. The cook was also good at theater. We really couldn't carry on a conversation because the place is really noisy, but he really made a production of cutting and plating up that duck when he saw us watching him. Well after that private cooking demo, we just had to order that canard.\n\nThat same station prepped our dessert. By this time, we had been there for so long that a second cook had taken over the spot. We established a rapport and jokingly told him that while the donuts were delicious, serving 5 pieces really wasn't any good because it left an odd donut out. How would we divide this dessert fairly? The next thing we know, we were served a single donut stuffed with strawberry ice cream. \n\nGood companionship, great conversation, delicious food and engaging kitchen staff made this an awesome dining experience. The $$$$ bill didn't even phase us. (Well it did, we only realized afterwards that we could have save some bills by ordering from the happy hour menu.) The price will prevent this place from being a regular dining spot. We will be back, though I know it may be difficult, if not impossible to recreate the same conditions for another perfect meal.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-01-03"}, {"excerpts": ["My girlfriend ordered the Yang Zhou Fried Rice (barbequed pork) and the Peking Roast Duck (green onions, cucumber, hoisin sauce, house made buns.)

"], "author": "David R.", "review": "On Saturday, 10/4/14, my girlfriend and I ate at M.Y. China for lunch. Back in March of 2013 was the first time my girlfriend and I ate at M.Y. China. We had a really good experience and thought the food was excellent.  The second time we ate at M.Y. China was in September of 2013. We didn't have a good experience. My Sweet & Sour Pork was horrible. The pork tasted old and was very chewy. The Scissor Cut Boar Noodles weren't good either. The Boar was very fatty and chewy, literally inedible. The noodles were burnt as well. The only dish that was good was the Potato Pancake appetizer. I must say the Manager on duty at the time handled the situation very well. She offered to have the dishes remade or anything else we wanted on the menu. She ended up comping our entire bill and brought out a free dessert. She was very professional and handled the situation perfectly. \n\nMy girlfriend wanted to give M.Y. China another shot. I kept telling her that I have a feeling it's not going to be good. We ended up going anyways and here's how it all went down. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nThe restaurant is very nice. The open floor plan makes the restaurant look even larger than it really is. There's a really nice bar area located to the right once you enter the restaurant. I like the Chinese decor and design throughout the restaurant. The open kitchen is pretty cool because you get to see the chefs prepare dishes along with stretching long noodles. \n\nFood:\n\nI ordered the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup (slow simmered short rib, baby bok choy.) The soup was mediocre at best. The beef short rib tasted like old pot roast. There was a ton of fat on the short rib. The noodles tasted okay. I didn't like the taste of the spices that were in the soup. They were too overpowering. The baby bok choy tasted good and fresh. About half way through my soup I noticed something disgusting! I was using my fork to grab some more noodles and noticed a hair in the broth! The hair ended up on the side of the bowl! It looked like an eye brow hair or eye lash. I was turned off at that point and couldn't eat anymore. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Yang Zhou Fried Rice (barbequed pork) and the Peking Roast Duck (green onions, cucumber, hoisin sauce, house made buns.) We thought the fried was average. It tasted like your regular Chinese fast food restaurant fried rice but with less soy sauce. The pork tasted old to me. My girlfriend thought the duck was good when you add the sauce and put everything into the bun but by itself it lacked flavor. She also thought the duck was a little too dry. \n\nService:\n\nOur waitress Chelsea was very nice. When I showed Chelsea the hair in my soup she immediately apologized and said she will let the manager know right away and the manager will come over to talk to me. Chelsea offered to bring out a new soup. When I declined and told her no thank you Chelsea asked me if I wanted anything else on the menu. I told her no thanks. The manager never came over to our table to address the hair in my soup. I think it's very unprofessional that the manager didn't come over to our table and literally take a few seconds out of their day to address the issue. This is how you lose customers because to me it clearly shows that the manager didn't care or even think it was a huge deal that there was a hair in my soup. Any time there is a complaint or any discrepancy in a restaurant by a customer it is normally standard protocol for a manager to handle the situation accordingly. The manager at M.Y. China failed to do that! Of course the soup was taken off of our bill. \n\nOverall:\n\nAfter having two bad experiences at M.Y. China I can definitely say that my girlfriend and I will never eat there again! M.Y. China must be losing a lot of customers especially if a manager can't take a few seconds out of his or her day to come apologize for a hair being in a customer's soup! M.Y. China has fallen off our go to list of Chinese restaurants. \n\n****ATTENTION!!! Martin Yan, if you're reading this you need to go back to this restaurant and regulate on them! If you don't I guarantee you'll be losing business on a consistent basis.

For starters, we ordered the Shiu Mai and Pork Juicy Dumplings. They were very tasty, and on par with the dumplings that you can find in Chinatown. We also ordered the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which was our favorite dish by far. I never had scissor cut noodles before, and I really liked the texture. I'm also a total sucker for anything with wild boar.

Not to mention that you are also paying for ambiance and location. I should also mention that I am an SF local who grew up both in the sunset district and richmond district and have eaten my fair share of authentic Chinese and asian cuisine so I am judging the place, not based solely on the price but rather how authentic the flavors and styles are. \n\nI have been here a total of 4 times, twice with my hubby, once with a friend and once by myself. I enjoy sitting where you can watch the chefs cooking the food. I should mention that I am familar with Chef Martin Yan, as I did grow up watching his cooking chows on tv and he was probably one of the first celebirty chefs on tv. I have yet to meet him myself but that of course would only be an extra special treat! ;)\n\nSo here are my personal recommendations:\n\n*Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles \u91ce\u8c6c\u5200\u526a\u9762 14-\n Almost reminds me of a chow fun but with smaller, fatter noodles but that nice rich oyster flavor. I do think for the price it could use a bit more noodle and perhaps another vegetable.\n\n*Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup \u725b\u8089\u624b\u62c9\u6e6f\u9762 14-\nAlthough, I have had this soup at a few places already, what really made this one amazing was the tenderness of the beef and how it wasn't chewy or fatty, the noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth was well balanced (although, I wish there were a tad bit more broth than noodles)\n\n*Sichuan Green Beans (v) 8-\nAgain, a common dish, however, I highly recommend this as a vegetable side due to the the green beans being perfectly crisp, not soggy at all and the sauce is delicious. This one is actually a decent portion where two of us were able to get full.\n\n*Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders (2) \u8336\u9999\u8c6c\u8169\u5305 8\nProbably my favorite appetizer ever-perfectly steamed buns with just the right amount of tender pork belly and complimented with pickled daikon and veggies and a  slightly zesty peppercorn oil. I wish there were at least 3 of these included for the price though.\n\n*Honey Glazed BBQ Pork \u8702\u871c\u53c9\u71d2 10\nMy China's version of \"char sui\" and this one isn't the least bit fatty or chewy. It's thinly sliced, honey kissed and just PERFECT if you are into meat (which I rarely am but actually enjoy eating this) \n\n*Twin Scallops Fried Rice \u53cc\u8c9d\u7092\u98ef 10\nI know this is just fried rice but they do it so well in this case and you do taste some of those scallops. It's a great \"filler\" dish if you just want to get full and save money.\nI also highly recommend just pairing this with the \"honey glazed BBQ pork\" for a satisfying meal. \n\nTIP: Come here during lunch on a weekday for better service and no wait! ;)", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-08-26"}, {"excerpts": ["I was also really pleased with the wine selection, so we wound up ordering the roast chicken boa, pan fried pork bao, veggie spring rolls and sichuan green beans, as well as a beer and zin from the drinks menu.\n\n"], "author": "Cassandra J.", "review": "We came here on Saturday afternoon for lunch, after going by many times and checking out the menu (which had several veggie options for me).

"], "author": "Martin C.", "review": "I recently ate at MY China w/my GF prior to a performance at the Golden Gate Theater.  I hesitate to give it only 2 stars but it is really all that it deserves.  Here's why.\n\nI did not expect MY China to prepare \"authentic\" home cooked Chinese food but I did expect them to prepare an elevated version of Chinese dishes that would justify the high prices they charge at this restaurant and IMO they failed to do this.\n\nFirst off, I must say that we had a very pleasant server who accommodated our request for a change in tables but she was not very well trained.  She did not know what a Blue Sapphire Martini was and another server had to come to our table w/her for clarification about the drink.  She also could not answer some questions that we had about the menu. She got the answers for us but had to ask, which I think is an indication of lack of training.  \n\nNot the fault of the server but one of the answers we got was unacceptable for a restaurant that aspires to be a high quality restaurant.  I was interested in the steamed fish and asked what kind of fish it was, how large the fish was and whether it was fresh or frozen.  I was told it was sea bass, that it was only a 6 oz portion and that it was FROZEN.   You can buy a fresh 2 lb sea bass for about $10 at the fish market and, even if MY China doesn't have the room for a fish tank, they can certainly source FRESH fish for a $32 dish.  Obviously, we passed on that.\n\nIn order to get a feel for the type of food MY China offered, we ordered the Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders, the Mu Shu Pork Tacos, the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Abalone in Oyster Essence.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Big Knife Fish Noodles and a side of Sichuan Green Beans.\n\nLet me start by saying the BEST dish that we were served was the Abalone in Oyster \"Sauce.\"  It was the closest thing to REAL Chinese food that we were served and it was EXCELLENT!!!  Well worth the $18 for the roughly 3-4\" long abalone that was served whole.  It was tender and succulent dressed in properly seasoned oyster sauce. \n\nHowever, the rest of the dishes were either uninspiring or totally off-putting.\n\nThe pork sliders and mu shu pork tacos were just ok.  I like bacon and pork belly and was hoping the sliders would be unique. There was nothing particularly WRONG about them, they were just bland and uninteresting.  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork sliders was what you'd expect from MY China -- a modern take on the classic mu shu pork dish.  It came w/mu shu flavored pork pieces in a bun (thicker than you'd get w/a normal mu shu pork dish) but it didn't have the same taste/texture of mu shu pork that is commonly served.  I particularly missed the slivered green onions and hoisin sauce that is typically offered w/mu shu pork.  It may have been in there but I didn't notice it.  An ok dish but again relatively bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe Salt/Pepper Calamari was NOTHING like the salt/pepper calamari you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. For one this, it was VERY greasy.  I liked that they included the tentacles, which many Americanized Chinese restaurants leave out because some people can't handle the sight of them (let alone eat them), BUT the  tentacles and other body parts were very large and not bite sized.  The coating on the calamari was also so soaked in oil, it did not have any \"crunch\" which you would normally get w/fried calamari and there were really wasn't much spice in the dish.\n\nKung Pao Chicken is a very common dish served in almost every Chinese restaurant, whether it's Cantonese, Mandarin or actually Szechuan where it originated.  The dish we got had very large deep fried pieces of chicken in it; I prefer it stir fried.  Like the calamari it was VERY greasy and, although it had a lot of dried red chilies in it, it oddly did NOT taste very spicy\n\nThe Big Knife Fish Noodles was basically seafood chow mein, which supposedly included scallops, shrimp and calamari along w/shitaki & enoki mushrooms in XO sauce. Saw the shitaki/enoki mushrooms but didn't see much in the way of scallops or shrimp. This dish was also VERY greasy and, despite the XO sauce, seemed bland and not adequately seasoned.  \n\nLastly, read good reviews about the Sichuan Green Beans on Yelp which we thought would be an appropriate companion w/the chicken and seafood.  However, there was really nothing special about this dish either, except that it was also VERY greasy and lacked spice, which one would expect w/a Sichuan dish.\n\nAll in all a GREAT disappointment given the generally poor quality of the dishes we received and the cost - about $160 including the tax/tip, the martini (which was very good) and a bottle of Prosecco (which was also acceptable although an ice bucket was not available to chill it.\n\nIf I were to eat at MY China again, which is unlikely, I'd sit at the bar and just order from their discounted Happy Hour menu instead.

China - Martin Yan's China - was a nice discovery for us.\n\nMy husband and I came to San Francisco for the 2018 Bay to Breakers last weekend. We had eaten way too many times in Chinatown on previous trips to the city. This time, we wanted to try some place new. The manager at Hotel Zelos recommended M.Y. China. \n\nThe manager's recommendation turned out to be a real treat. M.Y. China is located in the vicinity of our hotel near Union Square. The walk from hotel to restaurant is less than 15 minutes. We came here twice in a span of 3 days.\n\nFirst Visit May 19, 2018\n\nThree of us came shortly after 5:00 on Saturday for dinner. There was no line. We were quickly seated at a table just outside the main entrance. The view from our table was amazing. Yes, we were dining on the 4th floor of the busy Westfield San Francisco Centre, but as we pan our surroundings, we didn't get much of the hectic vibes at all.\n\nWe ordered Wok Seared Beef, Grandma's Gai Lan, Steamed Tofu & Portobello and brown rice. \n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Aromatic arugula enhanced the flavors of the the meat. Loved the slightly chewy, yet tender, beef.  \n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Lightly seasoned. Saut\u00e9ed the way my Mom used to. Loved the Chinese sausage.\n* Steamed Tofu & Portobello - Beautiful presentation. Tofu was silky smooth, very fresh. Loved the scallion-ginger sauce \n* Brown Rice - Perfect accompaniment for the dishes. Loved the texture. \n\nSecond Visit Monday, May 21, 2018\n\nWe were initially concerned about the choice of M.Y. China for our lunch for 5 because one of our guests is a vegetarian. But it turned out that there were quite a few dishes that would work. We ordered 6 dishes to share, including 3 vegetarian ones.\n\n* Wok Seared Beef - Tasted just as delicious as Saturday's, but the beef didn't look as appetizing. Presentation a little off.\n* Grandma's Gai Lan - Every bit as good as Saturday's. Fresh gai lan, lean lap cheong. Loved it.\n* Garlic Pea Shoots - Vegetarian. This was a hit. Fresh and tender. Seasoned just right.\n* Eggplant & Tofu Clay Pot - Vegetarian. Loved the flavor of basil and black pepper sauce.\n* Tempeh Sliders (2 orders) - Vegetarian. Nicely garnished with pickled daikon and cilantro.\n* Roasted Chicken - Excellent. Crispy skin, tender meat. Didn't even need the seasoned dipping salt. Easily our favorite for this lunch.\n* Brown Rice - Very good. Nice to find brown rice in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nOur overall impression:\n\n* Food - Excellent, as expected of the renown Chef Martin Yan.\n* Service - Just okay. Saturday server seemed to rush us when there wasn't a crowd waiting to be seated. Service was better on Monday.\n* Price - Reasonable for a good San Francisco restaurant.\n* Location - Convenient. Accessible by public transportation. No need to drive and fight downtown traffic.\n\nIn summary, all 5 of us enjoyed dining here, although there were comments about the dishes showing up lukewarm, not hot. The gai lan, for example, was served already cold. That was disappointing.\n\nIt's a solid 4-Stars for M.Y. China for both of our visits. We'll be here again on our next trip to San Francisco. This time, we'll inquire about the secret Chinese menu mentioned in one of the Yelp reviews. We'll also try the popular Dim Sum Sampler and the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles.\n\nA final note: I don't know what management can do about screaming kid(s), if anything. On Saturday, there was a grandma, mom and a young kid seated at the table cater-cornered to ours. The kid was screaming repeatedly. At one point, she got on top of the table. She  pulled on a plate, dropped and shattered it on the floor. Her screaming became piercing. It was impossible to carry on a normal conversation.

If you want to haul ass down the peninsula to Santa Clara and the like, yes you're going to find something better.  Here, they serve them steaming hot each in large oversized red ceramic spoons. The dumplings are adhered to the spoon with a piece of sticky flour, so don't try to pick them up, peel them off.  Just poke a hole and enjoy sipping and eating them from the serving spoon. They put a piece of cucumber on the bottom of each spoon that synergizes well with the oily soup.

For Chinese New Year my family and I wanted to celebrate at R&G lounge, but unfortunately it was completely booked up the whole night. So we settled on with MY China instead. We made reservations online using OpenTable, and surprisingly it was completely open ended.\n\nArriving at the restaurant 15 minutes early, we were in for a different surprise. The restaurant was packed and there was no available seating inside the restaurant. We asked about our reservation for 7:15. The hostess asked us to please wait a moment. From my quick understanding it seems they were inundated with last minute guests and did not bother to reserve seating for the guests who made reservations. An automatic star downgrade in my book. The hostess made us wait for another 15 minutes. We asked again about our table, and she said oh what is your name? SMH, we've been standing here for 15 minutes and we just talked to you. They in between seated a table of 8 people who had no reservations. They offered to put us at a table out of the way and on the outside, after we complained lightly about getting the 5 minute wait end around.\n\nWith that out of the way, the service was a lot better. Our waitor Bolo, did a great job discussing the menu with us and treated us with great care. The food was all delivered to our table very quickly. Can't fault that table service.\n\nThe food itself was reasonable, but not spectacular or of great value. We had the following dishes:\n\n+ Steamed Seasonal Fish - ***/5 - The portion was a bit too small. We wanted a whole fish with the head and tail in tact specifically for Chinese New Year, but they could not accommodate this because we were not a table of 6.\n+ Wok Seared Beef - ***/5 - Pretty standard wasn't absolutely wowing me.\n+ Whole Crispy Roast Chicken - ****/5 - pretty decently cooked, very moist cuts and everything tasted great, they even provided 5 spice dipping powder on the side.\n+ Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles - **/5 - not a fan of this dish, not enough chunks of the boar meat, and the noodles were a bit odd in texture.\n+ Garlic Pea Shoots (Dau Miu) - ****/5 - pretty simple, nicely done, and at standard.\n\nOn the outside, the restaurant looks very extravagant, modern and upscale. It just did not live up to the expectation that I had in terms of quality for the value. I understand that the place they are in is high rent for the sq/space.

China delivers on that front in spades.\n\nMy cousin flew in and after nearly a full week of fancy eating (e.g.: Napa Valley right after the 6.0 quake, even) decided that she wanted to try Chinese.  After all San Francisco is a Chinese city too.  \n\nAnyway I thought about where I could take her and honestly, within city limits, there was nothing that excited me.  But I thought to myself that maybe the novelty of that Martin Yan place could ease the painful fact that the Chinese food scene in SF is mostly embarrassingly bad restaurants.  In fact the Martin Yan brand was what prevented me from even trying it out when it first opened -- I thought it was all fancied up fake Chinese food (yeah, I've lived in the East Asia long enough to earn the snob points on food authenticity... so there!).  Heaven forgive me for being so wrong about staying away from M.Y. China for so long.\n\nM.Y. China is not only authentic, it is how real Cantonese food should taste like.  Here is why:\n\nWe started with the Crispy Organic Tofu: beautiful silken texture within a golden crust that \"grabs\" on to the proper amount of seasoning with subtle hints of the jalapeno.\n\nBeef Hand-Pulled Noodles Soup:  full of flavours. I know, another reviewer has found this too sweet but I think it's just by a touch.  The ribs were tender and moist, not jerky-like as in other establishments.  Most importantly the ribs were bursting with flavours.  The use of ribs here is a departure from the traditional cut used for this dish which is shanks -- beef shanks have a layer of silverskin that, if not removed, imparts a \"offally\" taste to the broth and many restaurants don't bother with removing it.  I understand, it's fiddly and labour intensive.  Which is why short ribs are a genius work around.  I, myself, use a chuck cut for this dish.\n\nVenison Chow Fun: I cannot say enough about this one.  The \"wok breath\" shone through like nothing else.  This is a masterful, take-no-prisoner, artistic and technical tour de force.  The Fun retained the proper \"pull\", a texture hard to describe, you just have to try it, with the requisite smokey flavour accompanied by the also smokey crunch of the mung bean sprouts -- the sprouts were \"kissed\" by the very hot wok just enough.  The venison, almost a side note since the chow fun part was so spectacular, was tender and cut into small cubes.  Like the practice of Kung Fu, the wok \"chi\"/breath can only be wielded by a true Shifu (not that red panda in the cartoon but a true master).\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots: the freshness comes through without being overpowered by the garlic (other restaurants doing this dish falls down on this dish in part for the still raw garlic flavour).  One can tell from the texture that it meets the \"shoots\" definition.  Shoots are \"young\", tender greens.  You don't necessarily get this level of tenderness at other restaurants serving this dish.  In addition, unlike many other restaurants that keep over-using the word \"fresh\"  (can't taste it... ) the Shifu/Chef actually let the freshness showcase itself in this dish.  You can actually taste that freshness.\n\nFinally we finished our meal with the Lychee Panna Cotta: again, the flavour of the Lychee shone through both in the panna cotta itself and the granita sprinkled on top.  I don't know how the dessert chef managed to concentrate so much Lychee-ness into the Panna Cotta, it's more than just using chunks of the fruit.  It tastes as if the dish was somehow spritzed with a pure perfume of the Lychee essence.\n\nDrinks: Tanqueray Martini extra dry, I emphasized \"super extra dry\" with a twist -- waitress thought I said Daiquiri Martini (what in the world is that?) is not bad but not chilled or dry enough but overall good enough.  A little stingy with the portion... I think.  I also had a glass of the  Gewrutzstraminer, Lafken 2011 (Chile) a little too sweet for my palate but a fine white to complement the meal anyway.\n\nNote to bartender: try using a perfume spritzer bottle to spritz the vermouth (best to use Noilly Prat) on the outside of the martini glass.  Extra dry in my opinion is for olfactory enjoyment, not quite for gustatory enjoyment.  Also the lemon peel oil need to be squeezed out and rubbed on the rim a bit more.\n\nService: very courteous, just slightly understaffed, I think?  We had to remind a server for some request (I forgot what) once.\n\nM.Y. China is a seriously good restaurant.  I haven't had such spectacular Chinese food (or other types of cuisine) in a long time.  While the dishes we ordered are considered street food in East Asia but they are street food done uncompromisingly properly.  Sometimes I think it's even difficult to find this level of care and technical flair in East Asia anymore.\n\nWell done Martin Yan!  Well done M.Y.

Not to mention that you are also paying for ambiance and location. I should also mention that I am an SF local who grew up both in the sunset district and richmond district and have eaten my fair share of authentic Chinese and asian cuisine so I am judging the place, not based solely on the price but rather how authentic the flavors and styles are. \n\nI have been here a total of 4 times, twice with my hubby, once with a friend and once by myself. I enjoy sitting where you can watch the chefs cooking the food. I should mention that I am familar with Chef Martin Yan, as I did grow up watching his cooking chows on tv and he was probably one of the first celebirty chefs on tv. I have yet to meet him myself but that of course would only be an extra special treat! ;)\n\nSo here are my personal recommendations:\n\n*Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles \u91ce\u8c6c\u5200\u526a\u9762 14-\n Almost reminds me of a chow fun but with smaller, fatter noodles but that nice rich oyster flavor. I do think for the price it could use a bit more noodle and perhaps another vegetable.\n\n*Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup \u725b\u8089\u624b\u62c9\u6e6f\u9762 14-\nAlthough, I have had this soup at a few places already, what really made this one amazing was the tenderness of the beef and how it wasn't chewy or fatty, the noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth was well balanced (although, I wish there were a tad bit more broth than noodles)\n\n*Sichuan Green Beans (v) 8-\nAgain, a common dish, however, I highly recommend this as a vegetable side due to the the green beans being perfectly crisp, not soggy at all and the sauce is delicious. This one is actually a decent portion where two of us were able to get full.\n\n*Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders (2) \u8336\u9999\u8c6c\u8169\u5305 8\nProbably my favorite appetizer ever-perfectly steamed buns with just the right amount of tender pork belly and complimented with pickled daikon and veggies and a  slightly zesty peppercorn oil. I wish there were at least 3 of these included for the price though.\n\n*Honey Glazed BBQ Pork \u8702\u871c\u53c9\u71d2 10\nMy China's version of \"char sui\" and this one isn't the least bit fatty or chewy. It's thinly sliced, honey kissed and just PERFECT if you are into meat (which I rarely am but actually enjoy eating this) \n\n*Twin Scallops Fried Rice \u53cc\u8c9d\u7092\u98ef 10\nI know this is just fried rice but they do it so well in this case and you do taste some of those scallops. It's a great \"filler\" dish if you just want to get full and save money.\nI also highly recommend just pairing this with the \"honey glazed BBQ pork\" for a satisfying meal. \n\nTIP: Come here during lunch on a weekday for better service and no wait! ;)", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-08-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the twin scallops fried rice as well as salt & pepper calamari...yum and YUM!!

I feel like this was on par with many other Chinese restaurants I've been to (except the whole time I was there, my friends and I were the only Asian people I saw in the restaurant, everyone else was a white family....) You could probably find food that is just as good at a cheaper Chinese place but the vibes might not be as classy or fusion feeling.

A full flavored traditional soup, which reminded me of soup that my Mom made. \n\nSpicy Sichaun lamp chop with forbidden rice, crispy noodle, gai lan, Sichuan bean sauce.

The rice was good, but a little bland, and it worked well with the other dishes.\n\nThe service was great, and the servers refilled our waters when it was getting low in our glasses.

"], "author": "Sen-Sei S.", "review": "For those who may not know, M.Y. is for \"Martin Yan\". If you don't know him, this guy can pay debone an entire chicken with a meat cleaver in less than 20secs. Tons of cooking shows over the years, one thing that keeps playing in my damn head is that stupid song associated with the make-shift flash mob commercial for Granite Expo (Martin Yan LOVES Granite Expo btw). Anyway, I've been a little reluctant to try this spot (a little bit because of that tv commercial, a little bit because of the location inside the Westfield Shopping center). In addition, I'm spoiled because my better half is Chinese from Taiwan and her mom can bang out the \"super authentic/non-American-ized\" menu. All I can say is.. I've been shortchanging myself. This is not \"upscalemall food! \n\nFOOD: Since it was our first time, we wanted to try a wide scope of the menu. Loved loved loved the \"Bang-Bang Chicken Wings\" (6 for $9) & \"Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders\" (2 for $8); only comment here, & this is my palate mind you, is that I didn't get the smoked flavor. I also wish there was a little more belly since there's only two per order. / Moving onto the Entrees, we ordered the \"Wok Seared Beef\" on arugula ($20). This was super tasty, but lots of arugula. We also ordered the \"Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood\" ($18) which was beyond good, as well as the \"Yang Zhou Fried Rice\" ($11); a little more pork please.. Rounding up the mains were two more: something from the \"specials\" for the night and a house-hold staple. The \"Eggplant Clay Pot with tofu and veggies\" ($12) was good, but the winner for the night was the \"Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp w walnuts, cumbers and wasabi\" ($23); just enough bite from the wasabi to open your nasal passages. Dessert: Sugar Puffs w. chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, raspberry coulis (5 for $8).. Just the right amount. \n\nSERVICE: It's Monday night @ 7pm and the place is packed due to all the foot traffic from Oracle World down the street. Here I was thinking it would be easy/breezy/quiet to celebrate my wife's bday. Wrong. But here's where the surprises started. I mentioned that we were celebrating a bday in the OpenTable reservation and wanted a low-traffic spot in the restaurant to chow & enjoy each other's company. The hostess gets us in the perfect spot; close to the kitchen, but far enough away from the large group section. (Win). Then the shift manager Daniel comes up and hands us 2 comp glasses of bubbles and a bday card signed by everyone working that night. (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I mean seriously, who does that anymore..). Now that is a testament to a smart manager going \"above and beyond\". Things like our water glasses were always filled when they hit the 1/2 way mark; An informed server that could provide suggestions and tell me why; Our dishes served hot and together, or one right after another. These actions aren't just reserved for dining at Gary Danko or Boulevard, they are the result of actions associated with a true service mentality and phenomenal venue management. (I'm speaking about Daniel). \n\nPRICE: This is San Francisco. Not much I can say that anyone reading this review will be shocked about when it comes to the price point for menu items. One thing to factor is to have an understanding of the \"cost\" per plate for the house -vs- menu price. An indicator is not only the overall portion for the order, but the amount of the premium element (how much beef to amount of arugula / how much seafood to noodles to veggies / how many shrimp to cumbers / how much pork in the rice, etc...). That being said, the price point for each item was affordable, but the main items were all a little light. Probably because of the rent they have to pay, which I'm sure is insane. \n\nAMBIANCE: This is where you're teetering on inside/outside dining that's not actually \"outside\". A few tables along the perimeter of the restaurant which you need to navigate to reach the check-in station. Nice bar along the right side, while a open kitchen layout with counter seating. Nice blend of 2 and 4 tops with very limited number of booths (which I highly recommend if you can get them). There's an overflow room in the back which is great larger groups, but be prepared to talk loud. Well lit, and spaced out so you're not rubbing elbows when you go for your napkin. All in all, a comfortable dining experience where I could have a conversation, sitting in a booth mind you. \n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a stickler when it comes to eating out. I cook, so I know. One of the BEST service and food experiences I've had in San Francisco in a very very very long time.

We had a really good experience and thought the food was excellent.  The second time we ate at M.Y. China was in September of 2013. We didn't have a good experience. My Sweet & Sour Pork was horrible. The pork tasted old and was very chewy. The Scissor Cut Boar Noodles weren't good either. The Boar was very fatty and chewy, literally inedible. The noodles were burnt as well. The only dish that was good was the Potato Pancake appetizer. I must say the Manager on duty at the time handled the situation very well. She offered to have the dishes remade or anything else we wanted on the menu. She ended up comping our entire bill and brought out a free dessert. She was very professional and handled the situation perfectly. \n\nMy girlfriend wanted to give M.Y. China another shot. I kept telling her that I have a feeling it's not going to be good. We ended up going anyways and here's how it all went down. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nThe restaurant is very nice. The open floor plan makes the restaurant look even larger than it really is. There's a really nice bar area located to the right once you enter the restaurant. I like the Chinese decor and design throughout the restaurant. The open kitchen is pretty cool because you get to see the chefs prepare dishes along with stretching long noodles. \n\nFood:\n\nI ordered the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup (slow simmered short rib, baby bok choy.) The soup was mediocre at best. The beef short rib tasted like old pot roast. There was a ton of fat on the short rib. The noodles tasted okay. I didn't like the taste of the spices that were in the soup. They were too overpowering. The baby bok choy tasted good and fresh. About half way through my soup I noticed something disgusting! I was using my fork to grab some more noodles and noticed a hair in the broth! The hair ended up on the side of the bowl! It looked like an eye brow hair or eye lash. I was turned off at that point and couldn't eat anymore. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Yang Zhou Fried Rice (barbequed pork) and the Peking Roast Duck (green onions, cucumber, hoisin sauce, house made buns.) We thought the fried was average. It tasted like your regular Chinese fast food restaurant fried rice but with less soy sauce. The pork tasted old to me. My girlfriend thought the duck was good when you add the sauce and put everything into the bun but by itself it lacked flavor. She also thought the duck was a little too dry. \n\nService:\n\nOur waitress Chelsea was very nice. When I showed Chelsea the hair in my soup she immediately apologized and said she will let the manager know right away and the manager will come over to talk to me. Chelsea offered to bring out a new soup. When I declined and told her no thank you Chelsea asked me if I wanted anything else on the menu. I told her no thanks. The manager never came over to our table to address the hair in my soup. I think it's very unprofessional that the manager didn't come over to our table and literally take a few seconds out of their day to address the issue. This is how you lose customers because to me it clearly shows that the manager didn't care or even think it was a huge deal that there was a hair in my soup. Any time there is a complaint or any discrepancy in a restaurant by a customer it is normally standard protocol for a manager to handle the situation accordingly. The manager at M.Y. China failed to do that! Of course the soup was taken off of our bill. \n\nOverall:\n\nAfter having two bad experiences at M.Y. China I can definitely say that my girlfriend and I will never eat there again! M.Y. China must be losing a lot of customers especially if a manager can't take a few seconds out of his or her day to come apologize for a hair being in a customer's soup! M.Y. China has fallen off our go to list of Chinese restaurants. \n\n****ATTENTION!!! Martin Yan, if you're reading this you need to go back to this restaurant and regulate on them! If you don't I guarantee you'll be losing business on a consistent basis.

Both dishes are very good, splurge on the sea bass if you're interested in seeing how fish can taste like fatty meat :3\n\nPeking Duck:  pass, go to excelsior's Beijing restaurant.  The duck here is old, dry and the rest is whatever.  Also they serve it with buns, not the pancake.\n\nOthers: Forbidden rice is crack. It's mixed rice (purple, wild, other) that is steamed and then seems to be lightly fried or tossed in sesame oil?  It's very fragrant. Another great thing is the garlic pea shoots (it's a side).

China. He smiles at me and I clamp up.\n\nMe: *Cheezing*\nMY.: \"You guys have the best seat in the house. Enjoy dinner!\"\nMe: *Still Cheezing*\nMY: *Confuzzled*\n\nHmm, perhaps I should have said something to him huh? *Sigh*\n\nDespite all the negative reviews, I had my heart set on trying M.Y. China because after all, I grew up watching MY. \n\nExpecting the worse, I was pleasantly surprised at how much they have improved since their earlier negative reviews. It was a packed house on Christmas Eve but service wasn't compromised. Unlike Hakkasan which opened on the same day (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hakkasan-san-francisco#hrid:_fFgMsiWO9taQD3lLV-Z6w ), M.Y. China is for the American palate even though they're part of Koi Palace and their chefs are Chinese. But with no MSG after effects (thanks to old age, I've become highly allergic and they use none), I was able to enjoy Chinese food without getting MSG induced heart palpitations.\n\nF O O D\nSnapshot of all our dishes: http://bit.ly/UvOhI3\n\n*Pork & Black Truffle Juicy Dumplings ($18) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/TDcQ7d\nSadly, the thin skin stuck to the spoon so the dumpling tore apart upon eating and all the broth leaked onto the spoon. *Sad pouty face* It was one juicy dumpling though but the truffle essence was very faint; almost undetectable.\n\n*Shu Mai ($6) - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/V7bNZa\nPlump and tender, the shu mai tasted just like any I can get on Clement street or in Chinatown for a fraction of the cost. The same problem arose as the dumplings, the skin got stuck on the serving spoon.\n\n*Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles ($14) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/UbcCz9\nThe best dish of the night, this dish was reminiscent to chow fun but with a freshly made gemelli-like noodle used. The noodle was al-dente with a toothsome chew and the tender wild boar was like a rich and porky with a slight gamey undertone.\n\n*Honey Glazed Shrimp ($22) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/V7bX2K\nMy least favorite dish of the night, excess wet batter needed to be shaken off because the fried shrimp had a very uneven fried batter throughout. I wasn't fond of the pungent Chinese mustard in the mayo as it overpowered the delicate sweetness of the shrimp.\n\n*Braised Short Ribs in Clay Pot ($25) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/YQGvLA\nI love rustic Chinese clay pot short ribs but this was disappointing.  The ribs weren't in chunks but rather sliced like thin cuts of steak and needed to be cooked down more as there wasn't a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. It was also very bland.\n\n*Forbidden Rice ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/V7QdDE\nLoved this dish. The combo of brown rice, wild rice, corn and goji berries made it a savory and slightly sweet sensation.\n\n*Purple Yam Croquettes w/ Almond Ice Cream ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/10o33nr\nSweet purple potato with a sweet condensed milk center rolled in crunchy slices of almonds served with a nutty, creamy sweet ice cream? Can't get any better than that.\n\nSkip the wine. Pours were stingy and my glass was less than 1/3 filled.\n\nS E R V I C E\nOur waiter was friendly and attentive and our food was coursed out. Food service was timely though not lighting speed as you would expect at a typical Chinese restaurant because everything is made to order and from scratch.\n\nI loved that MY was overseeing the chefs in the kitchen and noting what needed to be improved in Cantonese (yeah, I was eavesdropping).

(; With such low expectations, I was definitely in for a pleasant surprise (especially after finding out M.Y. stood for Martin Yan)!\n\nThis is not your typical hole-in-the-wall, bad-service Chinese restaurant. In fact, far from it! Upon entering through the front, one of their hosts greeted me by my name when I told him that I was meeting two former colleagues for dinner and then he proceeded to escort me to the table. My immediate thought was: 'Whoa! What just happened here?! What kind of Chinese restaurant is this?!' \n\nAs we walked through the restaurant, the second most striking difference was their d\u00e9cor; it was sleek and modern yet elegant and tactful. Not only was each table covered with white, fancy-looking linens, but each table was also decorated with classy dinnerware. Needless to say, I was impressed by their exceptional customer service and decor, especially since I'm so used to the negligent customer service I receive from most Asian restaurants.\n\nThough the menu is reminiscent of your typical Chinese restaurant, it won't come out looking like your ordinary Chinese food. All of the dishes that we ordered were creatively designed to include many bright-colored food and beautifully arranged on modern plates or bowls. The food presentation was absolutely amazing! It certainly deserves a picture-taking moment.\n\nTheir food tastes just as delicious as they look! We ordered...\n+Spicy Seafood Dumplings: This appetizer includes six dumplings perfectly wrapped in a bright spinach wrap and stuffed with scallops and shrimp. The sauce gives the dumplings a kick of flavor without being overpowered with the spiciness.\n+Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood: The squid ink snap noodles are saut\u00e9ed with vegetables and a variety of seafood, including shrimp, scallops, and calamari in a creamy sauce. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish! It's absolutely delicious.\n\n(Note: When they presented us with this dish we were confused and thought they had given us the wrong dish because we were expecting to see long noodle strands. So, imagine our surprise when we saw short, dark, doughy-looking pieces of something that looked really foreign to us. Yes, those foreign things are in fact the squid ink noodles.)\n\n+Stir Fried Green Beans: These crunchy green beans are saut\u00e9ed in a light, somewhat spicy sauce, and are a wonderful complement to the entr\u00e9e dishes we ordered.\n+Kung Pao Chicken: This dish includes a combination of stir-fried chicken, jalape\u00f1o, peanuts, and crunchy red dried peppers. The crunchy red dried peppers will surprise you!\n+Forbidden Rice: This is a combination of red rice, brown rice, barley, and wolfberries. With so much flavor and texture packed in this rice dish, it certainly didn't taste like my usual, healthy brown rice dish. Definitely a nice addition to the other dishes!\n+Sugar Egg Puffs: Four huge egg puffs filled with a custard cream filling served with three different kinds of sauces, including dark chocolate, vanilla bean Chantilly cr\u00e8me, and raspberry coulis. It tasted delicious with or without the sauce.\n\nI must admit that the portions are much smaller than what I had expected, especially for the price we were charged. But, the phenomenal presentation and delicious food, accompanied with the great customer service and beautiful d\u00e9cor do seem to justify the higher prices.

The noodle, which are supposed to be a specialty, were a varying degree of thickness. The chef didn't do a good job of pulling the noodles.

While the skin was nice & thin, the top dough portion of the dumpling was raw.\n5) Hong Kong Noodle: The best dish of the night.. The noodle was crispy enough, and the toppings had enough flavor.\n6) Pork Truffle Juicy Dumpling: This was the worst designed dish ever.

There are a couple of other restaurants up in that area that looked worth a try as well, but we wanted Chinese food and this place doesn't disappoint.\n\nRestroom alert - they have co-ed restrooms, so don't be surprised is you walk into the hand washing area and see ladies thinking you have walked into the wrong area, you didn't.  They have individual WCs in there, but that was different for sure.\n\nI had heard some reviews about the seating...this was not an issue for us.  We were sat in a low traffic area with a couple of other people, but we weren't that close - but close enough that you could see what others were getting and ask questions on what they were being served as everything looked great.\n\nIt was fun to watch the \"show\" happening in the visible kitchen with the LONG noodles and even the dumpling guy was tossing them in from a long distance, so that can be fun - just stay out of the way of the busy waiters who were hauling food back and forth from that area.\n\nWe started with a couple of fancy cocktails - the M.Y. China Mai Tai was pretty tasty, and had a kick to it...be careful if you order too many of these as they were pretty powerful.\n\nDim Sum - Our waiter recommended the Pork & Crab juicy dumplings - these were really good interesting combination of flavors- - maybe a little pricey, but crab is not cheap.  \n\nWe split the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup - easily enough for two people, but warning - these noodles are really long...and you will look like an episode from I LOVE LUCY where you need scissors to cut the noodles to get into your bowl...they are LONG.

The energy of the place is incredible with the open faced kitchen where you can see the many chefs preparing everything by hand. Martin Yan was entertaining a group the night we were there, complete with camera crew so we got to see something special. The head chef, Tony, is one of the top chefs from China and he is incredibly warm as well as incredibly talented. We watched him make hand pulled noodles blindfolded. If you've ever seen this done, it's already a feat using your sight.\n\nDrinks:  Tasty and creative. There was a spicy drink called Fire in the Wok that I recommend if you want a little bite or something to fight off a cold. I enjoyed Under the Bronze Bell, a champagne drink mixed with ginger liquor and St. Germain Elderflower (and a touch of grenadine I think), named after the huge bell shipped from China that is now the centerpiece of the bar.\n\nI'm actually giving 4.5 stars. Half star goes away for our server not telling us we'd ordered too much food for our table of 8 even after we specifically asked her to let us know if we ordered too much. For starters, we could have done without duplicates of the dishes. It didn't help that there was some confusion among our group as to what people were ordering. But having said that, our server and the rest of the staff were outstanding.\n\nNow the upside to ordering all the food we had is that I can say there are SO many yummy things on the menu. \n\nDumplings: Wild boar, pork & crab, seafood, all were outstanding. I'm a huge fan of DTF and am waiting for the day one opens in the south bay (please let it be soon). The first two are served in traditional steam baskets and dramatically served in individual soup spoons (careful, they're hot!) and a slice of carrot. Downside is the carrot doesn't cover the whole surface area so the dumplings still tear open. Upside is the spoon catches all the delicous broth from the dumpling so you can enjoy it with the chewy perfection that is the skin.\n\nAvocado shrimp rolls: I could have skipped this one. Fresh ingredients but even with the peanut dipping sauce I was more interested in devouring other things.\n\nMu Shu tacos: Very generous helping for 2 tacos. Can easily feed 4 as an appetizer.\n\nWild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: One of our favorites, highly recommended.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Cold, so maybe not everyone is a fan, but these thinner noodles have lots of flavor and a little spice.\n\nHK Crispy Noodles: You can't go wrong with crispy noodles. =) Very traditional and one of my childhood favorites, the noodles around the outside are crispy and then soft in the middle under the sauce and toppings.\n\nHoney Glazed Walnut Shrimp: This is delicious pretty much anywhere you go but these are great. Lightly glazed, not drowning in sauce.\n\nBok Choy: Simple, basic, and a good side that goes with everything.\n\nMapo Tofu: Great if you like silken tofu. Not so great if you prefer the texture of firmer tofu.\n\nForbidden Rice: You want to order it just for the name. But it doesn't disappoint. This was probably the dish that surprised everyone with all the flavor.\n\nTwo of our table had their own soup noodle dishes, the Beef Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and the Vegetarian Longevity Noodle Soup. Both were a big hit and happily devoured.\n\nLastly, we received a very cool dessert made by Tony. It was a large plate of very fine noodles fried and covered in sugar, strawberry syrup, and berries. It may sound strange but it was so light and delicious. It was almost like Chinese cotton candy.\n\nIn general, because the menu can be a little confusing portion-wise, the noodle and wok dishes can easily feed a table of 4. Even some of the sides like the bok choy and mapo tofu can feed up to 6 unless you want a generous portion of those items and don't plan on sampling other things.\n\nThis is a little far for me to visit all the time but I will definitely be back!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The har gow was made with large shrimps, the forbidden rice was great, the shaken beef with arugula was sub par, and wild boar scissor cut noodles were no more than par.

China restaurant at the Westfield Mall but it was worthwhile. \n\nOn January 6th 2013 I finally had the pleasure to take my mother who was visiting from Brazil and a friend of mine for his birthday's dinner party. \n\nWe ordered three main course and a side order of Forbidden Rice - b.t.w. very well prepared and the presentation quite interesting.\n\nFor appetizer we had Chairman Mao's Chicken. It was crispy without being greezy -fried perfectly. The chicken was juicy and tender, the jalapeno gave it a kick and together with red bell pepper it balanced the taste. I was savoring my seventh piece when disaster stroke, I bit in a big chunck of cartilage -  it completely ruined  for me. I always have bad luck regarding chicken, if there is a cartilage it will be on my plate. At that point I was worried about, but things turned out better.  \n \nAs always the chinese way of serving family style reminds me of home, so we were able to taste from everything. \n\nMy mother had the Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp. My friend and I usually eat that particular dish at the Sky Dragon in South San Francisco - they do a pretty good job there and we always thought it was the best in the Bay Area although I have to admit Martin Yan took the dish experience to a whole new level. It was glazed to perfection, the flavors well balanced, the cucumber touch added freshness - a detail you don't find at Sky Dragon.\n \nMy friend ordered Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles. The last time I had wild boar was in Parana State in Brazil but we prepare completely different from the Chinese. Nevertheless it was delicious the way they served at M.Y. China, a little salty which I like. The noodles were cooked al dente to my surprise - usually the Chinese overcook the noodles which I find a little hard on the digestion. To me this was the best of all the dishes. \n\nI ordered the Wok Tossed Shrimp with Ginkgo Nuts. Unfortunately I didn't care much about, it was blend, a little gooey, and too safe - it is something you order if you are not adventurous. The best part of the dish it was the ginkgo nuts, never had before - the taste and texture are incomparable to anything. We all agreed the dish was a minus - don't order it you will be disappointed.\n \nThe waiter who served us was very efficient although I would rather have someone less uptight speaking a little slower - she ran her tongue like a speed boat, it was hard to catch up with her.\n \nOverall it was a pleasant experience and I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu. The only strange thing I found it was to seat at a restaurant in a mall and eat well.

The lady was even kind enough to fulfill our request to seat us in one of  the nice round tables at the front of the restaurant where it's less noisy than inside. \n\nFor dinner we ordered\n1)  Kabocha Squash Soup - comes with fried wonton. Definitely felt that there could have been more wonton (it was so good) but the soup was very good for a starter. 2 orders is more than good for 5 people.\n2) Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken\nSo good! The sauce was excellent - far trumped any crispy noodle experience I had\n3) Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp\nMost expensive dish we ordered - At $22 it was a phenomenal dish. I typically hate honey glazed walnut shrimp, but convinced by my friends, I tried one and I actually think this is the only honey glazed walnut shrimp I ever really liked. The dish tends to be too mayo-ey for my taste, but MYChina had the perfect amount of glaze and perfect texture.\n4) Honey Glazed BBQ Pork \nInstant favorite among us. It's a small portion however. But it is sooo good! Words do not describe!\n5) Forbidden Rice. \nLove love love the forbidden rice - it's red + regular rice together I think - the wolfberries and a bit of egg - the combo is just creative and really good.

I was so happy that it was not the sticky mess that I've seen and had in other restaurants!  These ribs were fork tender, so they have been slow cooked, and they had been fried and dusted with a coating of spices and chili.  OMG!  The thai basil is more than a garnish.

I mentioned that we were celebrating a bday in the OpenTable reservation and wanted a low-traffic spot in the restaurant to chow & enjoy each other's company. The hostess gets us in the perfect spot; close to the kitchen, but far enough away from the large group section. (Win). Then the shift manager Daniel comes up and hands us 2 comp glasses of bubbles and a bday card signed by everyone working that night. (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I mean seriously, who does that anymore..). Now that is a testament to a smart manager going \"above and beyond\". Things like our water glasses were always filled when they hit the 1/2 way mark; An informed server that could provide suggestions and tell me why; Our dishes served hot and together, or one right after another. These actions aren't just reserved for dining at Gary Danko or Boulevard, they are the result of actions associated with a true service mentality and phenomenal venue management. (I'm speaking about Daniel). \n\nPRICE: This is San Francisco. Not much I can say that anyone reading this review will be shocked about when it comes to the price point for menu items. One thing to factor is to have an understanding of the \"cost\" per plate for the house -vs- menu price. An indicator is not only the overall portion for the order, but the amount of the premium element (how much beef to amount of arugula / how much seafood to noodles to veggies / how many shrimp to cumbers / how much pork in the rice, etc...). That being said, the price point for each item was affordable, but the main items were all a little light. Probably because of the rent they have to pay, which I'm sure is insane. \n\nAMBIANCE: This is where you're teetering on inside/outside dining that's not actually \"outside\". A few tables along the perimeter of the restaurant which you need to navigate to reach the check-in station. Nice bar along the right side, while a open kitchen layout with counter seating. Nice blend of 2 and 4 tops with very limited number of booths (which I highly recommend if you can get them). There's an overflow room in the back which is great larger groups, but be prepared to talk loud. Well lit, and spaced out so you're not rubbing elbows when you go for your napkin. All in all, a comfortable dining experience where I could have a conversation, sitting in a booth mind you. \n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a stickler when it comes to eating out. I cook, so I know.

This one is actually a decent portion where two of us were able to get full.\n\n*Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders (2) \u8336\u9999\u8c6c\u8169\u5305 8\nProbably my favorite appetizer ever-perfectly steamed buns with just the right amount of tender pork belly and complimented with pickled daikon and veggies and a  slightly zesty peppercorn oil.

I loved watching Yan Can Cook as a child and I was excited to have the opportunity to see what his restaurant had to offer. \n\nThe wild boar scissor cut noodles are a must try. They are so flavorful and have that nice \"wok\" flavor to them. It can be a bit salty to some palates but it goes well with the entrees. The Beijing knife cut noodles are also worth trying. They are cooked well and are a nice vegetarian option. The beef hand pulled noodles are also good. The presentation is very neat and the broth is quite tasty. But I would recommend trying the dry noodles to the noodle soups are you can taste more of the \"wok\" flavor and it's much easier to share. Also, the chefs sometimes put on a show as they pull the noodles right in front of your table. \n\nMy favorite entree has to be the five spice pork ribs. Don't let the word ribs deceive you into the dish being messy and hard to eat because it's quite the opposite. The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. The pork ribs I presume is slow cooked and then fried a bit on the outside to give it that crispy golden color and taste. It's so delicious that you must try for yourself. The lamb chops are also on the top of my list. It's seasoned with cumin and chili powder and tastes so flavorful and juicy. Also, you can give the Peking duck a try. It's not the best Peking duck but it is still good and satisfies the craving. \n\nFrom the small eats, the tea smoked pork belly sliders are wonderful. They are tender and goes nicely with the bun.

"], "author": "Martin C.", "review": "I recently ate at MY China w/my GF prior to a performance at the Golden Gate Theater.  I hesitate to give it only 2 stars but it is really all that it deserves.  Here's why.\n\nI did not expect MY China to prepare \"authentic\" home cooked Chinese food but I did expect them to prepare an elevated version of Chinese dishes that would justify the high prices they charge at this restaurant and IMO they failed to do this.\n\nFirst off, I must say that we had a very pleasant server who accommodated our request for a change in tables but she was not very well trained.  She did not know what a Blue Sapphire Martini was and another server had to come to our table w/her for clarification about the drink.  She also could not answer some questions that we had about the menu. She got the answers for us but had to ask, which I think is an indication of lack of training.  \n\nNot the fault of the server but one of the answers we got was unacceptable for a restaurant that aspires to be a high quality restaurant.  I was interested in the steamed fish and asked what kind of fish it was, how large the fish was and whether it was fresh or frozen.  I was told it was sea bass, that it was only a 6 oz portion and that it was FROZEN.   You can buy a fresh 2 lb sea bass for about $10 at the fish market and, even if MY China doesn't have the room for a fish tank, they can certainly source FRESH fish for a $32 dish.  Obviously, we passed on that.\n\nIn order to get a feel for the type of food MY China offered, we ordered the Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders, the Mu Shu Pork Tacos, the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Abalone in Oyster Essence.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Big Knife Fish Noodles and a side of Sichuan Green Beans.\n\nLet me start by saying the BEST dish that we were served was the Abalone in Oyster \"Sauce.\"  It was the closest thing to REAL Chinese food that we were served and it was EXCELLENT!!!  Well worth the $18 for the roughly 3-4\" long abalone that was served whole.  It was tender and succulent dressed in properly seasoned oyster sauce. \n\nHowever, the rest of the dishes were either uninspiring or totally off-putting.\n\nThe pork sliders and mu shu pork tacos were just ok.  I like bacon and pork belly and was hoping the sliders would be unique. There was nothing particularly WRONG about them, they were just bland and uninteresting.  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork sliders was what you'd expect from MY China -- a modern take on the classic mu shu pork dish.  It came w/mu shu flavored pork pieces in a bun (thicker than you'd get w/a normal mu shu pork dish) but it didn't have the same taste/texture of mu shu pork that is commonly served.  I particularly missed the slivered green onions and hoisin sauce that is typically offered w/mu shu pork.  It may have been in there but I didn't notice it.  An ok dish but again relatively bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe Salt/Pepper Calamari was NOTHING like the salt/pepper calamari you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. For one this, it was VERY greasy.  I liked that they included the tentacles, which many Americanized Chinese restaurants leave out because some people can't handle the sight of them (let alone eat them), BUT the  tentacles and other body parts were very large and not bite sized.  The coating on the calamari was also so soaked in oil, it did not have any \"crunch\" which you would normally get w/fried calamari and there were really wasn't much spice in the dish.\n\nKung Pao Chicken is a very common dish served in almost every Chinese restaurant, whether it's Cantonese, Mandarin or actually Szechuan where it originated.  The dish we got had very large deep fried pieces of chicken in it; I prefer it stir fried.  Like the calamari it was VERY greasy and, although it had a lot of dried red chilies in it, it oddly did NOT taste very spicy\n\nThe Big Knife Fish Noodles was basically seafood chow mein, which supposedly included scallops, shrimp and calamari along w/shitaki & enoki mushrooms in XO sauce. Saw the shitaki/enoki mushrooms but didn't see much in the way of scallops or shrimp. This dish was also VERY greasy and, despite the XO sauce, seemed bland and not adequately seasoned.  \n\nLastly, read good reviews about the Sichuan Green Beans on Yelp which we thought would be an appropriate companion w/the chicken and seafood.  However, there was really nothing special about this dish either, except that it was also VERY greasy and lacked spice, which one would expect w/a Sichuan dish.\n\nAll in all a GREAT disappointment given the generally poor quality of the dishes we received and the cost - about $160 including the tax/tip, the martini (which was very good) and a bottle of Prosecco (which was also acceptable although an ice bucket was not available to chill it.\n\nIf I were to eat at MY China again, which is unlikely, I'd sit at the bar and just order from their discounted Happy Hour menu instead.

It took a long time for our waiter to take our order. It took a long time for our order to arrive. It took an extremely long time to get our check. We stopped counting at 20 minutes.

The outside is dusted with sugar and despite the inclusion of chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream, and raspberry coulis, we preferred the chocolate to the point of exclusion of the other two.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly, efficient, invisible when nothing was needed, and immediately preset whenever they sensed something was needed.\n\nI will certainly be eating here again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-12-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The dishes with room for improvement: Shandong beef rolls had great flavors, but the pancake part was too hard.

Northern noodles are mixed with Shanghainess dumplings on the same menu as hot and sour soup and har gaw, each missing some component of authenticity.  Shanghainess dumplings aren't served with the right vinegar.  Noodles are missing the complex spices that often appears on these regional dishes. \n\nAlas, I am in Martin Yan's world. He already made it pretty clear that this MY's China.  He never claimed that it's the real China. I mean, the menu isn't even written in Chinese. So who am I to complain?\n\nOkay. So I block out the part of me that yearns for the real thing, and eat like a person who's learned to forgive Panda Express. \n\nThe good: steam buns may come with Americanized fillings like Mongolian beef, but the buns themselves are made beautifully, well risen into a perfect dome.  The BBQ pork is pricier than your local char siu shop, but you can see the quality.  Scissor cut noodles come with chewy and dry boar meat, but the noodles themselves are really chewy in a nice way.  \n\nThe great: the hand pulled noodle soup was the highlight.  Beef was done perfectly, tender, flavorful.  Talented Taiwanese mothers may beg to differ on how it should be made, but as long it's a good bowl of yumminess, we can forget about authenticity for a minute. \n\nThe dishes with room for improvement: Shandong beef rolls had great flavors, but the pancake part was too hard.

There is also a thin slice of carrot underneath the dumpling to separate it from the spoon, but that didn't seem to prevent the skin from sticking to the spoon and tearing upon consumption. In terms of taste, it was just average...  definitely had better xlb with less extravagant ingredients.\n\nAt my table of 4, I had the honor of eating the 5th and last dumpling. After the first bite, I noticed a little something sticking out of the meat. Out of curiosity, I pulled it...and pulled it... and pulled it... and it turns out it was a hair.  Major sad face because why is hair usually found in food AFTER most of it is consumed? Well at least it has been in my experience.  We called a manager over and showed him.  His face immediately turned grim and sullen, he took away the remainder of the dish and left promptly.  We saw him talking to one of the kitchen workers; one of the perks of an open kitchen, we customers can see most of what's going on. He came back to our table and told us he ordered another 3 pork and black truffle dumplings on the house for us.  Very odd arrangement, but we really weren't expecting anything since we ate the majority of the dish already. We didn't really want the extra 3 dumplings either since we were getting full already.

This is a MUST get small plate! I really enjoyed the crispiness to it! Messy to eat, BUT totally worth it!!\n\nHong Kong Style Noodles! Eat them fast before it gets soggy! Even if it does get soggy, it's still really good! \n\nGarlic Lobster- If you like garlic like I do, this is a must get!!! It comes with vermicelli noodles underneath the 2.5LB lobster so it soaked the garlic sauce pretty well! And a side of scissor cut noodles which was to die for!! \n\nWe had this dessert that was so pretty to eat! Pictures will be posted with this review! It came with a donut with ice cream on top and on top of that was chocolate and some type of berry sauce! \n\nGreat atmosphere, great food, and amazing people.. What more can you ask for?

Then another waiter comes around bearing some chili paste and serves it to  the guests a couple of tables over. Confused,  the customer rejects it. The waiter then YELLS around  \"did anyone order chili paste?!\" When we tried to call him to let him know we asked for it  but we didn't need it anymore (Since we'd already eaten our food), he'd already walked away. \n\nThe entire time, my boyfriend and I just watched as the joke of a service they had in the surrounding tables continues. Food and drinks were continously served at wrong tables. The table across us had a mother andher son impatiently waiting to get attention from a waiter.  The funniest thing was watching a waiter clean a table and as he walked away with the dirty dishes, a chopstick falls on the floor - instead of picking it up, he kicks the chopstick around on the floor.

My little one wanted pork with the fried rice instead of the scallops. Again the meat was so small, you could barely make out the meat. But I was really disappointed with the egg whites in the fried rice. Should have paid better attention to the menu. Anyway, this was by far the worst fried rice I ever had!

I'm not sure where the sweet and spicy sauce is but there was a lot of red peppers. Like a lot!  For a table that asked for it not to be spicy, I think their ordering system mistranslated my order.... Again!  \n\nAt this point, we're stuffed and guess what comes out last?!  The mixed green salad with papaya and shrimp. At least that was good compared to everything else that came out of the kitchen before it. And looking at the salad, I'm glad their ordering system didn't mistranslate this one!  \n\nOverall, I'm glad I came in to check it out and happy that my boys can say they had wild boar.

I can barely remember when Yan hasn't been on TV with his congenial gumption and frantic chopping expertise. I have to admit I came to M.Y. China with a great deal of trepidation because as good as his dishes looked on PBS back in the day, I thought he may have passed the point of relevancy when it comes to fine dining in a city with as much food gravitas as San Francisco.\n\nHowever, Yan's elaborate operation on the 4th floor of the Westfield Shopping Centre holds its own in many respects (photo: http://bit.ly/11zPDlJ). It just fell short of what I was hoping it would be. Perhaps my expectations were escalated by the fact that I had experienced two failed attempts to dine here right after it opened - one time due to a private party, the other because they were just full up. I finally made it as a solitary diner and was seated at the end of the long noodle counter. The menu is not very complicated, and I knew from the hype that chef Tony Chu was known for holding the record of pulling 16,000 noodles in two minutes flat. Clearly this uniquely dexterous feat meant you had to try the noodles which I did.\n\nBased on Michael Bauer's recommendation on sfgate.com, I went for the $14 Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, which were definitely the high point of the meal - irregularly cut handmade noodles tossed with shallots and Shaoxing wine (photo: http://bit.ly/12E0Kwm). I liked the rustic quality, and they were flavorful enough with the pieces of pork-like boar. I just wish there were more ingredients tossed in for a greater contrast in texture and flavor. Probably out of curiosity more than anything else, I ordered the $9 pair of Mu Shu Pork Tacos, which were a cheeky take on the standard Mandarin dish that comes with a stack of crepes.\n\nWhat arrived was a pair of tacos held upright in a stand with the mu shu pork stuffed in soft shells that were definitely not tortillas (photo: http://bit.ly/ZLSoh9). The net result was tasty but sloppy as the sesame oil would dribble out of the taco shell and onto my arm despite the proper vertical head turning in eating them. My last dish was the rather ordinary $8 Stir-Fried Green Beans which I ordered to counter the carb overload (photo: http://bit.ly/15Dd8zr). The beans had the right snap, but they were on the saucy side with a slightly oily aftertaste. All in all, I liked the boldness of the dishes even though I found they still need more refinement in their execution to satisfy at least my palate.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...solid handmade noodles but the tacos were more a novelty and the green beans didn't need that much sauce\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...very dramatic, a good use of the space underneath the dome...but it did get lonely being the only one eating at the counter (photo: http://bit.ly/17TXZtf)\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and helpful, no problems there\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if Yan can cook, then I pay Yan...simple as that", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-04-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The mu shu pork tacos are the best!"], "author": "Eric F.", "review": "This place is amazing!

Here's why.\n\nI did not expect MY China to prepare \"authentic\" home cooked Chinese food but I did expect them to prepare an elevated version of Chinese dishes that would justify the high prices they charge at this restaurant and IMO they failed to do this.\n\nFirst off, I must say that we had a very pleasant server who accommodated our request for a change in tables but she was not very well trained.  She did not know what a Blue Sapphire Martini was and another server had to come to our table w/her for clarification about the drink.  She also could not answer some questions that we had about the menu. She got the answers for us but had to ask, which I think is an indication of lack of training.  \n\nNot the fault of the server but one of the answers we got was unacceptable for a restaurant that aspires to be a high quality restaurant.  I was interested in the steamed fish and asked what kind of fish it was, how large the fish was and whether it was fresh or frozen.  I was told it was sea bass, that it was only a 6 oz portion and that it was FROZEN.   You can buy a fresh 2 lb sea bass for about $10 at the fish market and, even if MY China doesn't have the room for a fish tank, they can certainly source FRESH fish for a $32 dish.  Obviously, we passed on that.\n\nIn order to get a feel for the type of food MY China offered, we ordered the Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders, the Mu Shu Pork Tacos, the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Abalone in Oyster Essence.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Big Knife Fish Noodles and a side of Sichuan Green Beans.\n\nLet me start by saying the BEST dish that we were served was the Abalone in Oyster \"Sauce.\"  It was the closest thing to REAL Chinese food that we were served and it was EXCELLENT!!!  Well worth the $18 for the roughly 3-4\" long abalone that was served whole.  It was tender and succulent dressed in properly seasoned oyster sauce. \n\nHowever, the rest of the dishes were either uninspiring or totally off-putting.\n\nThe pork sliders and mu shu pork tacos were just ok.  I like bacon and pork belly and was hoping the sliders would be unique. There was nothing particularly WRONG about them, they were just bland and uninteresting.  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork sliders was what you'd expect from MY China -- a modern take on the classic mu shu pork dish.  It came w/mu shu flavored pork pieces in a bun (thicker than you'd get w/a normal mu shu pork dish) but it didn't have the same taste/texture of mu shu pork that is commonly served.  I particularly missed the slivered green onions and hoisin sauce that is typically offered w/mu shu pork.  It may have been in there but I didn't notice it.  An ok dish but again relatively bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe Salt/Pepper Calamari was NOTHING like the salt/pepper calamari you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. For one this, it was VERY greasy.  I liked that they included the tentacles, which many Americanized Chinese restaurants leave out because some people can't handle the sight of them (let alone eat them), BUT the  tentacles and other body parts were very large and not bite sized.  The coating on the calamari was also so soaked in oil, it did not have any \"crunch\" which you would normally get w/fried calamari and there were really wasn't much spice in the dish.\n\nKung Pao Chicken is a very common dish served in almost every Chinese restaurant, whether it's Cantonese, Mandarin or actually Szechuan where it originated.  The dish we got had very large deep fried pieces of chicken in it; I prefer it stir fried.  Like the calamari it was VERY greasy and, although it had a lot of dried red chilies in it, it oddly did NOT taste very spicy\n\nThe Big Knife Fish Noodles was basically seafood chow mein, which supposedly included scallops, shrimp and calamari along w/shitaki & enoki mushrooms in XO sauce. Saw the shitaki/enoki mushrooms but didn't see much in the way of scallops or shrimp. This dish was also VERY greasy and, despite the XO sauce, seemed bland and not adequately seasoned.  \n\nLastly, read good reviews about the Sichuan Green Beans on Yelp which we thought would be an appropriate companion w/the chicken and seafood.  However, there was really nothing special about this dish either, except that it was also VERY greasy and lacked spice, which one would expect w/a Sichuan dish.\n\nAll in all a GREAT disappointment given the generally poor quality of the dishes we received and the cost - about $160 including the tax/tip, the martini (which was very good) and a bottle of Prosecco (which was also acceptable although an ice bucket was not available to chill it.\n\nIf I were to eat at MY China again, which is unlikely, I'd sit at the bar and just order from their discounted Happy Hour menu instead.

You'll have to Google that but only experienced chefs can get it right and it's difficult to define (but not difficult to identify when you taste the difference!) It is one of the most important attributes that Cantonese people look for in Chinese food. It's what gives food life and excitement. Merely being palatable is not enough.\n\nWe had Chairman Mao's Chicken, which I expected to be drenched in some kind of sauce but wasn't...just a basket of crispy breaded chicken pieces with dipping sauce. We didn't even get any veggies in ours just a basket of breaded chicken. (Come to think of it nothing we had came with veggies not even for looks). This was listed as an entree item not a side or appetizer so I was already disappointed with our main course. I felt mislead. We were going to have this over our white rice but it just didn't go well together texture wise. It's definitely not like walking into a traditional Chinese restaurant, ordering any main course and being able to co-mingle everything together over rice. More upsetting that I look online at another version of the M.Y. China menu and this item is listed as a \"bar item\" / small bites and not an entree. (And it was $9 not the $16 we paid). This is equivalent to a restaurant adding a few extra chicken wings to their appetizer and changing it to a dinner plate...sorry but whether it's 6 pieces or a dozen, it's still an appetizer.\n\nWe also had whole wheat potstickers which were yum, salt and pepper calamari which was mediocre (edible but had no pizzazz in terms of preparation and presentation), 2 bowls of white rice, Peking duck (very good fresh buns but stingy on the duck skin...which weren't crispy and hot either. All I tasted was bun and no skin), and mu shu pork tacos which I enjoyed because it was different though my husband did not like the combination. \n\nOverall we spent about $80 which easily could have gotten us a family style Chinese dinner for 6 elsewhere. I was really hoping to either find some really great authentic food or something off the wall different but M.Y. China doesn't quite achieve either of them. Though the food will suit American tastes just fine, it might not be the place to take your Chinese parents to but it made for a nice date night for us. Even got to watch the light show under the dome while we ate. My only regret is not trying the noodles as fresh pulled noodles have got to be pretty awesome.\n\nOne last thing worth mentioning was the service. I don't know what happened but it went from excellent service at the beginning of our meal to nosediving at the end. The table next to us had a different server from us...however we finished eating around the same time. Up until that point, we had extremely attentive servers who kept coming to check on us. Then they suddenly disappeared. Not for 10 minutes, but for over 30 minutes. It was so bad, that the table next to us had to get up and wander towards the back of the restaurant looking for their waiter so they could pay the bill. They were visibly upset and so were we. From what we could tell no one was able to help them in the back either (I'm assuming the server had the bill). We had to waive a busboy down to help us...who looked unsure how to help us, even asking if we wanted him to box our food or us to do it ourselves. When our server finally got back to us (we waived him down), he wasn't apologetic and maybe was oblivious to how long we were waiting. He never offered dessert or anything...which I probably would've liked to try.\n\nFinally, the bill....which came clamped inside a giant metal fortune cookie. As cute as it may be, I'm surprised by how no one knew this would be a bad idea..HELLO? a huge bill in a fortune cookie for the incredibly superstitious? 1. It's like handing someone a red envelope with a \"You Owe ME\" in it and  # 2. Can you say Cliche'? Fortune cookies are about as authentic to Chinese food as the Taco Bell chihuahua is to Mexican food. #3. What are you wishing on me as I'm about to leave your establishment? Chinese people can we all together say \"CHOY GOH NAY!\" While we grab some incense to re-bless ourselves from your ignorance of our customs and beliefs. WTH?

I'll stop there, but will try to communicate my point via analogy.\n\nPanda Express -- one of the most successful fast food chains in history, but no one is confusing this place for Chinese food.  It's cheap, consistent American food and I actually don't mind eating there from time to time when I'm in that mood and I don't have to make an effort.\n\nMcDonalds -- even on their best days, quite possibly the worst commercially successful food you'll find.  If you take out price/value, there isn't a single thing on their menu that can compete beyond (maybe) their fries.  But that's not the point.  When you're starving, have no other options, speed maters, and forgot your wallet at home -- you find all of the spare change in your car and head over to their drive through.  They clearly have a place in this world and their business success and growth over time proves this.\n\nBenihana -- yes, started by a Japanese guy, but there's nothing Japanese about this place.  I used to be a little embarrassed going to this sort of place, but certain friends and business parters just can't get enough of it, so I make the trip every now and then.  Unless you actually enjoy the presentations, there's no value here and the food is pretty standard given that it receives so much help being (the equivalent of) pan fried in so much butter and oil.\n\nPF Changs (and similar) -- in these parts, this is where I take business folks or really, really Americanized friends for decent American food with the right ambiance, and no uncomfortable feelings.  No one is going to snicker here if you order some fried rice variant, mu shu pork, or something along the lines of beef broccoli.  It's all good and I'll eat more than my fair share too of \"that\" food.  Compare to other, so-called authentic Chinese places in the city, Cupertino, or Fremont -- there is no intimidation factor with hoards of native speakers, the service, or the menu.   And lest you think I'm being a Chinese food snob, that really isn't the point at all.  I know Chinese and Japanese food reasonably well, but so what?  I'm sure many of the Indian and Pakistani joints I frequent are considered only so-so by many of my more knowledgeable friends.  No one cares. There's clearly a worthy market here and these businesses are in it to make money, not get caught up in what's more authentic vs. Americanized.  Unless that's directly and strongly connected to making more money.\n\n\nM.Y. China is clearly in the same bucket as PF Chang's but I think a notch higher.  Better decor, decent celebrity power with Yan (though I wonder how some of his other ventures are doing), and the guy knows what's out there.  Marketing is top notch and the service was great.  He's not going to be able to compete at all on price relative to almost all other \"traditional\" Chinese venues in the city (very few can), but he's light years ahead of those same venues when it comes to a more American demographic.  And that's definitely intentional.  We're in America, there are a lot of Americans here.\n\n\nThough I must say that the one of the small dishes we tried (and we tried a lot) which really stood out as an absolute waste of time was the Chairman Mao's Chicken \"Small Eats\" basket.  Almost no taste, wasn't exactly light, and I couldn't understand what went wrong.  Even roasted chicken with (only) salt and pepper would be far more tasty than this.  Something must have been off that night. \n\nAnd I think the mu shu pork tacos were below average as well.  Nothing jumped out in terms of flavor, freshness, or a new interpretation on this fusion offering.  Certainly not inedible or bad, but we were all underwhelmed -- two native Chinese, American-born Asians, a World Traveler, and a gentleman from the UK.\n\n(Sure, you can poke fun at anyone who orders a dish with these sorts of names, but that's no excuse.  These guys know how to cook flavorful dishes.)\n\nFinally -- MSG or a lot of sodium in the dishes?  Going through an adjustment period?

Two cups per order, enough to share. Would that be Two Girls One Cup, One Dude Two Cups? Dunno, but these B Cups were awesome. B for Boar, that is. \n\nWild boar scissor cut noodles - we sat near the counter and saw one of the kitchen staff carefully use scissors to cut a ball of dough. He was clearly taking his time, and each piece of noodle looked pretty thin. Thus we were guessing if he was practicing and whether we would get the trial art and craft project stir fried (and he seemed to be taking his time doing so, versus first visit when the scissor cut noodle chef was slicing and dicing the dough at breakneck pace). The decision to request \"less salt, less oil\" was a good one (although somehow it became no salt no oil for some lost in translation reason). This arrived piping hot and very nicely stir fried. It was almost like a properly done moo shoo (luckily not moo shoo poo poo, that's something else entirely like uhm... PF). And this is where it is crucial to kick things up a notch and get some house chili sauce, which definitely elevated this. In retrospect, I should have asked for some XO sauce to try. Definitely the Chinese version of Cinghiale pasta, but stir fried.\n\nHoney glazed BBQ pork (cha siu) - It's $10 a plate, and while you can get half a pound or a takeout box for that much at the run down roasties deli shop, it is always fun to try a plate of this at a high end restaurant. It's a good taste tester for the kitchen, and a very welcoming popular BBQ item (honey glazed BBQ pork, what is there not to like unless you are a meat hating hipster but craves bacon wrapped sausages once in a while?). Generally lean for the most part, yet each bite was tender and juicy all the way through. A very delicate marinade, although the final roasting process probably had a tad too sweet of a molasses splash. The best part? Picking up a random slice (closer to the edges) thinking it's all lean, and when you bite into it, there's a portion of fat that somehow crept in. It melts in your mouth like warm sweet butter and honey, and suddenly you feel like you were shot into the skies. Or akin to eating at your favorite sushi bar, and the chef gives you a run of the mill looking item, and when you eat it you discover there's toro, uni, and wagyu in it. So yeah, this cha siu is great...yet subtly pornographic...like reading a novel called \"50 Shades Of Pork\".   \n\nSo no, ordering BBQ pork appetizer plate at a nicer Cantonese Chinese restaurant during dinner, is not an unusual thing. We don't have restaurants like Tin Lung Heen in Hong Kong that take Spanish Iberico black pig and use premium cuts to make cha siu.l...so places like Koi Palace and even MYC offering something like this that may be above average for expats, and very decent according to \"King Of FOBenese Food\", ain't so bad.\n\nStir fried bok choy with salted fish - when this arrived, it was as if the veggies were quickly clear stir fried with very little to no oil, and was very bland. Turns out our waitress misheard my \"less salt less oil\" and thought we meant \"no salt no oil\", and the kitchen withheld the salted fish (which she said was oily). We had this taken back and what a difference it made afterwards. The salted fish quantity and enhancement was not strong, but did make the dish taste better. Was half the price of large pea sprout with garlic ($16), so if you want your greens on, this is a safe choice.\n\n4 dishes for two, came out to a shade over $50, which is not unreasonable for the location, quality, and to factor in d\u00e9cor and service. Plus you get some free shows of hand pulled noodles every now and then, plus scissor cutting of noodles.\n\nToo bad Martin wasn't in the house.

M.Y. China delivers on that front in spades.\n\nMy cousin flew in and after nearly a full week of fancy eating (e.g.: Napa Valley right after the 6.0 quake, even) decided that she wanted to try Chinese.  After all San Francisco is a Chinese city too.  \n\nAnyway I thought about where I could take her and honestly, within city limits, there was nothing that excited me.  But I thought to myself that maybe the novelty of that Martin Yan place could ease the painful fact that the Chinese food scene in SF is mostly embarrassingly bad restaurants.  In fact the Martin Yan brand was what prevented me from even trying it out when it first opened -- I thought it was all fancied up fake Chinese food (yeah, I've lived in the East Asia long enough to earn the snob points on food authenticity... so there!).  Heaven forgive me for being so wrong about staying away from M.Y. China for so long.\n\nM.Y. China is not only authentic, it is how real Cantonese food should taste like.  Here is why:\n\nWe started with the Crispy Organic Tofu: beautiful silken texture within a golden crust that \"grabs\" on to the proper amount of seasoning with subtle hints of the jalapeno.\n\nBeef Hand-Pulled Noodles Soup:  full of flavours. I know, another reviewer has found this too sweet but I think it's just by a touch.  The ribs were tender and moist, not jerky-like as in other establishments.  Most importantly the ribs were bursting with flavours.  The use of ribs here is a departure from the traditional cut used for this dish which is shanks -- beef shanks have a layer of silverskin that, if not removed, imparts a \"offally\" taste to the broth and many restaurants don't bother with removing it.  I understand, it's fiddly and labour intensive.  Which is why short ribs are a genius work around.  I, myself, use a chuck cut for this dish.\n\nVenison Chow Fun: I cannot say enough about this one.  The \"wok breath\" shone through like nothing else.  This is a masterful, take-no-prisoner, artistic and technical tour de force.  The Fun retained the proper \"pull\", a texture hard to describe, you just have to try it, with the requisite smokey flavour accompanied by the also smokey crunch of the mung bean sprouts -- the sprouts were \"kissed\" by the very hot wok just enough.  The venison, almost a side note since the chow fun part was so spectacular, was tender and cut into small cubes.  Like the practice of Kung Fu, the wok \"chi\"/breath can only be wielded by a true Shifu (not that red panda in the cartoon but a true master).\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots: the freshness comes through without being overpowered by the garlic (other restaurants doing this dish falls down on this dish in part for the still raw garlic flavour).  One can tell from the texture that it meets the \"shoots\" definition.  Shoots are \"young\", tender greens.  You don't necessarily get this level of tenderness at other restaurants serving this dish.  In addition, unlike many other restaurants that keep over-using the word \"fresh\"  (can't taste it... ) the Shifu/Chef actually let the freshness showcase itself in this dish.  You can actually taste that freshness.\n\nFinally we finished our meal with the Lychee Panna Cotta: again, the flavour of the Lychee shone through both in the panna cotta itself and the granita sprinkled on top.  I don't know how the dessert chef managed to concentrate so much Lychee-ness into the Panna Cotta, it's more than just using chunks of the fruit.  It tastes as if the dish was somehow spritzed with a pure perfume of the Lychee essence.\n\nDrinks: Tanqueray Martini extra dry, I emphasized \"super extra dry\" with a twist -- waitress thought I said Daiquiri Martini (what in the world is that?) is not bad but not chilled or dry enough but overall good enough.  A little stingy with the portion... I think.  I also had a glass of the  Gewrutzstraminer, Lafken 2011 (Chile) a little too sweet for my palate but a fine white to complement the meal anyway.\n\nNote to bartender: try using a perfume spritzer bottle to spritz the vermouth (best to use Noilly Prat) on the outside of the martini glass.  Extra dry in my opinion is for olfactory enjoyment, not quite for gustatory enjoyment.  Also the lemon peel oil need to be squeezed out and rubbed on the rim a bit more.\n\nService: very courteous, just slightly understaffed, I think?  We had to remind a server for some request (I forgot what) once.\n\nM.Y. China is a seriously good restaurant.  I haven't had such spectacular Chinese food (or other types of cuisine) in a long time.  While the dishes we ordered are considered street food in East Asia but they are street food done uncompromisingly properly.

"], "author": "Martin C.", "review": "I recently ate at MY China w/my GF prior to a performance at the Golden Gate Theater.  I hesitate to give it only 2 stars but it is really all that it deserves.  Here's why.\n\nI did not expect MY China to prepare \"authentic\" home cooked Chinese food but I did expect them to prepare an elevated version of Chinese dishes that would justify the high prices they charge at this restaurant and IMO they failed to do this.\n\nFirst off, I must say that we had a very pleasant server who accommodated our request for a change in tables but she was not very well trained.  She did not know what a Blue Sapphire Martini was and another server had to come to our table w/her for clarification about the drink.  She also could not answer some questions that we had about the menu. She got the answers for us but had to ask, which I think is an indication of lack of training.  \n\nNot the fault of the server but one of the answers we got was unacceptable for a restaurant that aspires to be a high quality restaurant.  I was interested in the steamed fish and asked what kind of fish it was, how large the fish was and whether it was fresh or frozen.  I was told it was sea bass, that it was only a 6 oz portion and that it was FROZEN.   You can buy a fresh 2 lb sea bass for about $10 at the fish market and, even if MY China doesn't have the room for a fish tank, they can certainly source FRESH fish for a $32 dish.  Obviously, we passed on that.\n\nIn order to get a feel for the type of food MY China offered, we ordered the Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders, the Mu Shu Pork Tacos, the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Abalone in Oyster Essence.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Big Knife Fish Noodles and a side of Sichuan Green Beans.\n\nLet me start by saying the BEST dish that we were served was the Abalone in Oyster \"Sauce.\"  It was the closest thing to REAL Chinese food that we were served and it was EXCELLENT!!!  Well worth the $18 for the roughly 3-4\" long abalone that was served whole.  It was tender and succulent dressed in properly seasoned oyster sauce. \n\nHowever, the rest of the dishes were either uninspiring or totally off-putting.\n\nThe pork sliders and mu shu pork tacos were just ok.  I like bacon and pork belly and was hoping the sliders would be unique. There was nothing particularly WRONG about them, they were just bland and uninteresting.  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork sliders was what you'd expect from MY China -- a modern take on the classic mu shu pork dish.  It came w/mu shu flavored pork pieces in a bun (thicker than you'd get w/a normal mu shu pork dish) but it didn't have the same taste/texture of mu shu pork that is commonly served.  I particularly missed the slivered green onions and hoisin sauce that is typically offered w/mu shu pork.  It may have been in there but I didn't notice it.  An ok dish but again relatively bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe Salt/Pepper Calamari was NOTHING like the salt/pepper calamari you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. For one this, it was VERY greasy.  I liked that they included the tentacles, which many Americanized Chinese restaurants leave out because some people can't handle the sight of them (let alone eat them), BUT the  tentacles and other body parts were very large and not bite sized.  The coating on the calamari was also so soaked in oil, it did not have any \"crunch\" which you would normally get w/fried calamari and there were really wasn't much spice in the dish.\n\nKung Pao Chicken is a very common dish served in almost every Chinese restaurant, whether it's Cantonese, Mandarin or actually Szechuan where it originated.  The dish we got had very large deep fried pieces of chicken in it; I prefer it stir fried.  Like the calamari it was VERY greasy and, although it had a lot of dried red chilies in it, it oddly did NOT taste very spicy\n\nThe Big Knife Fish Noodles was basically seafood chow mein, which supposedly included scallops, shrimp and calamari along w/shitaki & enoki mushrooms in XO sauce. Saw the shitaki/enoki mushrooms but didn't see much in the way of scallops or shrimp.

The chrysanthemum infusion was bold yet muted and honestly, I don't think I've ever tasted such a strong flower essence in a drink that did not overpower the whole thing.

The service is superb, and I'm not sure if I've ever been so pleased with a restaurant that is technically inside a mall. \nSugar egg puff dessert (think big, fluffy sopapillas) is fantastic, especially when paired with choya dessert wine.

It doesn't have that sharp bite of most raspberries and is actually sweet. #delectable\n\nThe bar team is super cool and friendly, and it was obvious that they were very well acquainted with some of the regulars who were in here. The staff are very knowledgeable about each dish and are quick to suggest a pairing.

I didn't find it efficient, but it seems to work for them.\n\nInterior of this place is nice, dark walls,  dark floors, dim lighting, a very modern rustic feel to it, and oddly, I found their bathrooms to be beautiful. \n\nEnough about the restaurant itself, let's get to the food. \n\nBetween the four of us, we shared the House made Pickles trio (sour daikon, sweet squash, spicy papaya), Salt & Pepper Calamari w/ chili peppers, scallions, and the Hong Kong Crispy Noodle with Chicken XO and house made X.O. sauce. Everything was delicious, my only critique for the food was the Crispy Noodles seemed to lack something, a spice of sorts, or maybe a little bit of hot spice, the calamari was good, but i would've preferred more rings to tentacles, but despite this, it was all delicious!\n\nBUT WAIT........ our favorite part of the meal was dessert. Went with the Sugar Egg Puffs w/ chocolate fondue, vanilla bean chantilly cream and raspberry coulis. I'll be honest, when I think of sugar egg puffs, I think of the little puffs you get at Genki. Not the case here! these suckers were huge! Wish I had taken a photo, but they were gone before I even got a chance. \n\nAll in all, great little place if you're on a date, or just want a quick bite before a movie, or mid shopping lunch, a little pricey, but then again, its in a mall.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-30"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered: wild boar scissor cut noodles ($14), claypot braised beef short rib ($25), and da mieu (pea sprouts) ($16), one bowl of rice ($2), and for dessert, sugar egg puffs ($8).  \n\n", "Last but not least, the sugar egg puffs!

After all, I grew up watching him and since he's Cantonese too!  =)  Bf & I finally checked it out this past Saturday night & were lucky enough to get a 6:45 reservation with only an hour notice through Opentable.\n\nWe have both heard mixed reviews on the restaurant and weren't honestly expecting much, but boy were we wrong!  We had to wait about 5 minutes or so pass our reservation time, but at least we got a photo opp with Martin Yan himself while we were waiting by the front.  He definitely knows how to entertain as he was explaining the noodle making process to part of the restaurant.  And he walks around to some tables as well (including ours a couple times).  Gotta love that!  \n\nFor the appetizers we got  pork belly bun sliders ($8) & crab & pork dumplings ($12).  We also ordered: wild boar scissor cut noodles ($14), claypot braised beef short rib ($25), and da mieu (pea sprouts) ($16), one bowl of rice ($2), and for dessert, sugar egg puffs ($8).  \n\nThe pork belly bun sliders were so tasty!  The meat in his was quite a bit fattier than mine however.  I prefer these over Chairman Bao!  For the dumplings we got 4 & like Cherylynn commented, they were served on ceramic spoons in the steamer, which caused the dumplings to stick and most of them were also served punctured already, so we slurped most of the juice from the spoon directly.  Though it was aesthetically pleasing, this presentation makes no sense because the spoons were so hot and because the dumpling sticks to the spoons making it hard to get out.  I tasted the crab, while he said he couldn't.  I guess that was a trade off since he got one dumpling that wasn't punctured!  We loved the wild boar scissor cut noodle because of it's lightness and I'm always a sucker for my noodles.  We just wished that the noodles were a little longer.  The taste of the  boar was light too, which was a plus.  The short rib was tender and plentiful.  I loved the onions and the herbs and sauce, everything tied together so well and had that little bit of heat.  Da Mieu is pretty standard everywhere I've had it, with no complaints here either!  Last but not least, the sugar egg puffs!  We liked how they weren't as covered in sugar as the traditional Chinese places we've had them at does it.  However, they were greasier than what we're used to.  But, a plus here are the dipping sauces!  We loved the raspberry the most, but the chocolate fondue and vanilla chantilly creme are great as well.  \n\nService was pretty good and polite, but the restaurant was so busy that I think refills on water were overlooked for our table and our neighbor's.   The ambiance is eclectic mod Asian.  The bathroom is in the corner and has no door (it's unisex) but with several ceiling to floor stalls for some privacy!  The food portions, minus the appetizers were pretty generous.  We did have leftover claypot.  All in all, $102 for all that food plus one beer isn't bad.  It's a little like PF Chang's, but definitely more authentic, actually tasty & almost the same price!

The restaurant is located on the top floor of the westfield downtown mall in SF. There is a bar seating area, and a restaurant dining area and the decor has a modern Chinese style too it. \n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered several appetizers:\nTea Flavored Pork Belly Sliders - Fantastic taste. It comes wrapped in a soft fluffy steamed bun with pickle onions and juicy pork belly inside. Great start to the meal.\n\nJuicy Pork Dumplings - The dumplings came in a giant red spoons. Great idea to hold the soup after taking a bite! Downside is that after a bit the bottom would stick to the spoons so the dumpling would automatically rip apart! The meat was still amazingly delicious.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup - Well balanced flavor to the broth. It is very different from the classic asian restaurants in San Jose as the broth has a rich yet subtle taste. Definitely can tell the soup was quality made as it wasn't heavy and wasn't filled with oil and  flavor enhancers. The meat was also the best beef noodle soup meat I have had. It literally melted in my mouth and was not tough at all.\n\nWok Roasted Lobster - Another must get dish! The lobster was perfect and cracked so it was easy to get all the meat with out much of an effort! It was flavored with the usual Asian herb, and lemon seasoning. The lobster was extremely fresh and cooked the right amount.\n\nSugar Egg Puffs - Pure heaven. I think I could of ate 10 of these even after eating all the appetizers and entrees. The egg puffs are perfectly sugared and not too sweet at all. There is also a milky pudding texture inside, and the egg puffs come with vanilla, chocolate, and raspberry fillings.\n\nOverall the food is excellent quality and I don't think it is Americanized at all and brings out how Chinese food can be well balanced quality food.\n\nAdditionally the plating of the dishes were all brilliantly placed and even the tea we ordered came in small circular bows to drink out of.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe waiters were extremely attentive and came by our tables on several occasions to ask how the meal was.

(; With such low expectations, I was definitely in for a pleasant surprise (especially after finding out M.Y. stood for Martin Yan)!\n\nThis is not your typical hole-in-the-wall, bad-service Chinese restaurant. In fact, far from it! Upon entering through the front, one of their hosts greeted me by my name when I told him that I was meeting two former colleagues for dinner and then he proceeded to escort me to the table. My immediate thought was: 'Whoa! What just happened here?! What kind of Chinese restaurant is this?!' \n\nAs we walked through the restaurant, the second most striking difference was their d\u00e9cor; it was sleek and modern yet elegant and tactful. Not only was each table covered with white, fancy-looking linens, but each table was also decorated with classy dinnerware. Needless to say, I was impressed by their exceptional customer service and decor, especially since I'm so used to the negligent customer service I receive from most Asian restaurants.\n\nThough the menu is reminiscent of your typical Chinese restaurant, it won't come out looking like your ordinary Chinese food. All of the dishes that we ordered were creatively designed to include many bright-colored food and beautifully arranged on modern plates or bowls. The food presentation was absolutely amazing! It certainly deserves a picture-taking moment.\n\nTheir food tastes just as delicious as they look! We ordered...\n+Spicy Seafood Dumplings: This appetizer includes six dumplings perfectly wrapped in a bright spinach wrap and stuffed with scallops and shrimp. The sauce gives the dumplings a kick of flavor without being overpowered with the spiciness.\n+Squid Ink Snap Noodles with Seafood: The squid ink snap noodles are saut\u00e9ed with vegetables and a variety of seafood, including shrimp, scallops, and calamari in a creamy sauce. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish! It's absolutely delicious.\n\n(Note: When they presented us with this dish we were confused and thought they had given us the wrong dish because we were expecting to see long noodle strands. So, imagine our surprise when we saw short, dark, doughy-looking pieces of something that looked really foreign to us. Yes, those foreign things are in fact the squid ink noodles.)\n\n+Stir Fried Green Beans: These crunchy green beans are saut\u00e9ed in a light, somewhat spicy sauce, and are a wonderful complement to the entr\u00e9e dishes we ordered.\n+Kung Pao Chicken: This dish includes a combination of stir-fried chicken, jalape\u00f1o, peanuts, and crunchy red dried peppers. The crunchy red dried peppers will surprise you!\n+Forbidden Rice: This is a combination of red rice, brown rice, barley, and wolfberries. With so much flavor and texture packed in this rice dish, it certainly didn't taste like my usual, healthy brown rice dish. Definitely a nice addition to the other dishes!\n+Sugar Egg Puffs: Four huge egg puffs filled with a custard cream filling served with three different kinds of sauces, including dark chocolate, vanilla bean Chantilly cr\u00e8me, and raspberry coulis. It tasted delicious with or without the sauce.\n\nI must admit that the portions are much smaller than what I had expected, especially for the price we were charged.

As such, I was looking forward to M.Y. China, partly because of my familiarity with \"Yan Can Cook.\"  In the end, the overall experience was fine but didn't quite live up to my heightened expectations.\n\nFor starters, the pork & black truffle dumplings were on the larger size but 5 for $18 still seemed pricey.  Also, the dumpling skin seemed too thick for a soup dumpling and had to be eaten in several bites, which takes away from the overall experience of eating a soup dumpling.  Also, couldn't even tell there was truffle in the dish.\n\nAlso, going in I knew that handmade noodles were supposedly the highlight here.  Going out, I believe this this reputation was mostly overrated.  Neither the wild boar scissor cut nor the Beijing knife cut noodles impressed me much - both were thick and chewy and in my opinion, just ok.  But I will say the hand-pulled noodle soup with its savory broth and extremely tender beef was excellent.\n\nThe non-noodle dishes also equally hit or miss.  Both the lamb chops and the honey glazed BBQ pork were very good and left everyone was pleasantly surprised.  Our favorite dishes of the night.  But conversely, the mapo tofu was probably the worst I've ever had.  Completely bland and devoid of any flavor whatsoever.  No heat, no salt, no nothing.

The rice fist, about 5 minutes later, the first entree, then another 5 minutes for the beans, and then about 5 minutes later the beef.  This made the dinner very clunky and nothing was the same temperature.  I don't know if this is normal or the server/kitchen screwed up.  All of us were very annoyed with our server.

The drinks were very good, reasonably priced and the bartenders were funny and engaging.\n\nWe chose a table outside in the rotunda and despite having been warned by friends that it could be noisy out there, we found that was not the case.  Noise level was not a problem.  We started with Pork Juicy Dumplings and Crispy Organic Tofu, both of which were very good, with the tofu being excellent.  We had all the dishes family-style and went on to have Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles (very good), Wok Seared Seafood (excellent), Peking Roast Duck (outstanding!) and sides of steamed rice and Sichuan Green Beans.  They were all delicious, fresh and hot.  The Wok Seared Seafood was especially good, with a subtle and interesting flavor, not spicy, not bland.  The Peking Roast Duck was really excellent, the skin being perfectly crisped and the duck meat being perfectly moist, juicy and flavorful.  We did sample two deserts, the Sugar Egg Puffs and the house-made Candied Ginger Ice Cream.  I preferred the ice cream which was full-flavored and refreshing.\n\nThe wine list is eclectic and interesting.\n\nService was provided by Cedric, a true professional waiter.

Funny, the waiter gave me a spoon to eat this with.\n\nWhole wheat potstickers (5) - beautiful and even scalloped edges. Tastes like a regular potsticker but the skin has more texture. Accompanied by a spicy soy sauce.\n\nShandong beef rolls (2 and cut into halves)- quite tasty and not dry because of an ample amount of hoisin sauce. The green onion pancake has a pleasing texture that is easy to bite into.\n\nWild boar scissor cut noodles - Nice flavors and textures and you can see the skill in the making of the noodles. \n\nDan dan noodles - this was overly spicy for some reason. May be inconsistent because my friend said it was rather bland the last time she ordered it.  I like that there weren't too many peanuts and no peanut sauce flavor...personal preference. Still had a good flavor profile despite the spiciness.\n\nPork and black truffle juicy dumplings (5)- (otherwise known as xiao long bao XLB) rather disappointing. Sharp presentation with each dumpling resting in a large soup spoon.  Genius because you could just eat it off the spoon, IF it weren't for the fact that the spoon is scalding hot.  There is also a thin slice of carrot underneath the dumpling to separate it from the spoon, but that didn't seem to prevent the skin from sticking to the spoon and tearing upon consumption. In terms of taste, it was just average...  definitely had better xlb with less extravagant ingredients.\n\nAt my table of 4, I had the honor of eating the 5th and last dumpling. After the first bite, I noticed a little something sticking out of the meat. Out of curiosity, I pulled it...and pulled it... and pulled it... and it turns out it was a hair.  Major sad face because why is hair usually found in food AFTER most of it is consumed? Well at least it has been in my experience.  We called a manager over and showed him.  His face immediately turned grim and sullen, he took away the remainder of the dish and left promptly.  We saw him talking to one of the kitchen workers; one of the perks of an open kitchen, we customers can see most of what's going on. He came back to our table and told us he ordered another 3 pork and black truffle dumplings on the house for us.  Very odd arrangement, but we really weren't expecting anything since we ate the majority of the dish already. We didn't really want the extra 3 dumplings either since we were getting full already.  Just glad that he took action and wasn't aloof about it.\n\nTowards the end of our meal, a chef came out dancing around the dining area to perform noodle pulling to the Gangnam Style song.

"], "author": "Dave M.", "review": "I have to say, without a doubt, this is the best Chinese/Cantonese cuisine you can have anywhere in the Bay Area.\n\nYou only need one word: Flavours!  M.Y. China delivers on that front in spades.\n\nMy cousin flew in and after nearly a full week of fancy eating (e.g.: Napa Valley right after the 6.0 quake, even) decided that she wanted to try Chinese.  After all San Francisco is a Chinese city too.  \n\nAnyway I thought about where I could take her and honestly, within city limits, there was nothing that excited me.  But I thought to myself that maybe the novelty of that Martin Yan place could ease the painful fact that the Chinese food scene in SF is mostly embarrassingly bad restaurants.  In fact the Martin Yan brand was what prevented me from even trying it out when it first opened -- I thought it was all fancied up fake Chinese food (yeah, I've lived in the East Asia long enough to earn the snob points on food authenticity... so there!).  Heaven forgive me for being so wrong about staying away from M.Y. China for so long.\n\nM.Y. China is not only authentic, it is how real Cantonese food should taste like.  Here is why:\n\nWe started with the Crispy Organic Tofu: beautiful silken texture within a golden crust that \"grabs\" on to the proper amount of seasoning with subtle hints of the jalapeno.\n\nBeef Hand-Pulled Noodles Soup:  full of flavours. I know, another reviewer has found this too sweet but I think it's just by a touch.  The ribs were tender and moist, not jerky-like as in other establishments.  Most importantly the ribs were bursting with flavours.  The use of ribs here is a departure from the traditional cut used for this dish which is shanks -- beef shanks have a layer of silverskin that, if not removed, imparts a \"offally\" taste to the broth and many restaurants don't bother with removing it.  I understand, it's fiddly and labour intensive.  Which is why short ribs are a genius work around.  I, myself, use a chuck cut for this dish.\n\nVenison Chow Fun: I cannot say enough about this one.  The \"wok breath\" shone through like nothing else.  This is a masterful, take-no-prisoner, artistic and technical tour de force.  The Fun retained the proper \"pull\", a texture hard to describe, you just have to try it, with the requisite smokey flavour accompanied by the also smokey crunch of the mung bean sprouts -- the sprouts were \"kissed\" by the very hot wok just enough.  The venison, almost a side note since the chow fun part was so spectacular, was tender and cut into small cubes.  Like the practice of Kung Fu, the wok \"chi\"/breath can only be wielded by a true Shifu (not that red panda in the cartoon but a true master).\n\nGarlic Pea Shoots: the freshness comes through without being overpowered by the garlic (other restaurants doing this dish falls down on this dish in part for the still raw garlic flavour).  One can tell from the texture that it meets the \"shoots\" definition.  Shoots are \"young\", tender greens.  You don't necessarily get this level of tenderness at other restaurants serving this dish.  In addition, unlike many other restaurants that keep over-using the word \"fresh\"  (can't taste it... ) the Shifu/Chef actually let the freshness showcase itself in this dish.  You can actually taste that freshness.\n\nFinally we finished our meal with the Lychee Panna Cotta: again, the flavour of the Lychee shone through both in the panna cotta itself and the granita sprinkled on top.  I don't know how the dessert chef managed to concentrate so much Lychee-ness into the Panna Cotta, it's more than just using chunks of the fruit.  It tastes as if the dish was somehow spritzed with a pure perfume of the Lychee essence.\n\nDrinks: Tanqueray Martini extra dry, I emphasized \"super extra dry\" with a twist -- waitress thought I said Daiquiri Martini (what in the world is that?) is not bad but not chilled or dry enough but overall good enough.  A little stingy with the portion... I think.  I also had a glass of the  Gewrutzstraminer, Lafken 2011 (Chile) a little too sweet for my palate but a fine white to complement the meal anyway.\n\nNote to bartender: try using a perfume spritzer bottle to spritz the vermouth (best to use Noilly Prat) on the outside of the martini glass.  Extra dry in my opinion is for olfactory enjoyment, not quite for gustatory enjoyment.  Also the lemon peel oil need to be squeezed out and rubbed on the rim a bit more.\n\nService: very courteous, just slightly understaffed, I think?  We had to remind a server for some request (I forgot what) once.\n\nM.Y. China is a seriously good restaurant.  I haven't had such spectacular Chinese food (or other types of cuisine) in a long time.  While the dishes we ordered are considered street food in East Asia but they are street food done uncompromisingly properly.  Sometimes I think it's even difficult to find this level of care and technical flair in East Asia anymore.\n\nWell done Martin Yan!  Well done M.Y.

Well, the food quality/taste of what we ordered was damn good.  Like within range of Chinatown restaurant quality.  More authentic than P.F. Chang's   (since that is technically fusion).  Better quality than Panda Express (ok, that's a low bar to clear).  It was also as expensive as both of those places combined, but that was to be expected.  The serving sizes were plenty generous (we had leftovers of everything except the dessert).  I would've liked more sausage in the Gai Lan, but that's minor (and I really like Chinese Sausage).  The Asian pears - delicious (I didn't have much of the salad).   The lobster, also scrumptious, and cooked/cut in a way that much of the lobster was easy to extract from its carapace.  Finally, the Lychee panna cotta was inspiring, in that I want to make it for myself now (or a variation that has lychee bits in almond jello).

Chang's, the comparison between the two would be no contest.  As is, the pricing is just enough to push this into a category where I'd eat here once or twice a year.  However, the food is pretty close to legit, as I would expect from a Martin Yan inspired restaurant.  If you're at Westfield and looking for something fancy/posh, this would hit the spot.

There are tables in the patio area for those that would like a Under the Dome dining experience.  We opted for an inside center table near the patio which allowed for a view into the mall and view of the open kitchen area.\n\nWe were here for a Gilt City special menu.  Our friendly server, Daniel, explained the menu to us and described each dish as it was brought out.  \n\nLobster and Papaya with young papaya, tomato, thinly slice jalapeno, red onion, mint, cilantro, citrus juice, and fish sauce. The dish had a lobster claw meat and was nicely plated. Though Daniel stated this only had a mild spice, it was medium.  It was at the max of my spice, but it was too spicy for my dining partner.  Suggested to him that the menu should state that this dish is spicy. \n\nSeared scallops with smoked salmon roe, citrus soy vinaigrette. Perfectly seared scallops that was complemented well by the vinaigrette. \n\nMatsutake Soup with chicken, dried scallop, ham and wolfberry.  A full flavored traditional soup, which reminded me of soup that my Mom made. \n\nSpicy Sichaun lamp chop with forbidden rice, crispy noodle, gai lan, Sichuan bean sauce.  Though listed as spicy, the chop had only a hint of spice. The crispy noodles under the chop seemed out of place with this as it falls out of the plate as you're cutting the chop.  The Gai Lan were plain and needed some oil and soy/oyster sauce. The forbidden rice which consisted of red and brown rice and barley was tasty. \n\nSurf and turf - wagyu beef, jasmine tea smoked seabass, yang zhou fried rice, black pepper sauce. This was delicious dish. The honey glazed seabass was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The beef was tender and tasty with the black pepper sauce. The scoop of yang zhou rice with bbq pork, egg, mushroom and shrimp was good. \n\nMatcha tiramisu in a caramel sugar cloud.  The sugar cloud is made of spun sugar made for a dramatic presentation. You need to slowly collapse the cloud into the dessert or set it aside to eat the tiramisu, which was not like your typical tiramisu. \n\nThough located at a mall, the MY China's food is not mall fare.

Very comparable to xiaolongbao that I've had in Shanghai. You get five on their own individual ceramic spoons. It doesn't sound like much, but they are on the larger side.

We ordered a lot for three people so this was imperative for space saving.\n\nWe ordered some delicious tea to start. Definitely order tea! Then we had the Crab Dumplings which I would probably skip next time. The Salt & Pepper Calamari, yummy but more salty than peppery. The Hot & Sour Soup, so hot so yummy!!!!\n\nAs main and side dishes we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Chairman Mao Chicken which was lightly fried and stole the show. I personally loved the Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles, they where so yummy!!!!! As was the Yang Zhao Fried Rice, I'm not a big fan of fried rice but this is no regular fried rice. The pork and shrimp are beautifully seasoned and the flavors are just right!\n\nMajor Tip: save room for sweets! The Sugar Egg Puffs and Black Sesame Ice Cream were amazing.

We just finished a modest lunch at Super Duper Burgers a little over an hour ago so we certainly weren't hungry. However, we decided to go in just for a quick bite of dessert. We ended staying 3 hours. Our only excuse is we had just seen the 3rd Hobbit movie at the Metreon. In the spirit of Bilbo and hobbits everywhere, we ended up having a second lunch. \n\nWe ordered juicy dumplings and half a Peking roast duck. The dumplings were certainly juicy. The skins were very thin and delicate. We enjoyed the all pork filling more than the pork and crab roe combination but both kinds were delicious.\n\nThe duck served was just the breast meat. The fat was properly rendered leaving the meat moist without being greasy. The crackling skin was crispy and a delight to consume. At $20 we first thought it was expensive for just half a duck but because the duck was boneless and very meaty, we were able to consume the whole thing without any waste. It was a very good deal.\n\nFor libations, we ordered a mai tai and a Stella Artois cider. The mai tai was yummy and very well made. The cider was smooth and complemented the duck beautifully.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the sugar puffs or Chinese donuts and the black sesame ice cream. The donuts were warm and came with chocolate sauce, raspberry coulis and sweetened whipped cream. The ice cream was delicious and the flavor was a nice change from the ubiquitous green tea. Both desserts were yummy. We loved the thick, rich chocolate sauce but the best thing was when we stuffed the donut with the ice cream.  \n\nThe food was very good, not transcendent, but very good. What put M.Y. China over the top was the kitchen staff. We were seated at the chef's table. It is a counter facing the wok station of the open kitchen. Now I don't like sitting with my back to a room. I don't know, maybe I was a gangster or gunslinger in another life. My initial wariness quickly gave way to delight as we watched the busy cooks chop, fry and assemble food for the restaurant. \n\nWatching the food being prepared was actually what persuaded us to order more than dessert. We saw a fresh duck being pulled from the fryer. The golden, glistening skin just seduced us. The cook was also good at theater. We really couldn't carry on a conversation because the place is really noisy, but he really made a production of cutting and plating up that duck when he saw us watching him. Well after that private cooking demo, we just had to order that canard.\n\nThat same station prepped our dessert. By this time, we had been there for so long that a second cook had taken over the spot. We established a rapport and jokingly told him that while the donuts were delicious, serving 5 pieces really wasn't any good because it left an odd donut out. How would we divide this dessert fairly? The next thing we know, we were served a single donut stuffed with strawberry ice cream. \n\nGood companionship, great conversation, delicious food and engaging kitchen staff made this an awesome dining experience. The $$$$ bill didn't even phase us. (Well it did, we only realized afterwards that we could have save some bills by ordering from the happy hour menu.) The price will prevent this place from being a regular dining spot. We will be back, though I know it may be difficult, if not impossible to recreate the same conditions for another perfect meal.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-01-03"}], "matcha doodle ice cream": [{"excerpts": ["the matcha doodle ice cream and the egg puffs."], "author": "Joshua B.", "review": "Amazing food.

The hostess took my name, and I sat for about 5 minutes before we were shown to our table. \n\nThe place is something else. It is upscale, quite lovely and the decor is just grand.  It isn't what you expect for a mall eatery.  We walked past the open kitchen towards a table near the back and were seated. Our waitress Oulu came and took our drink orders, offering us either sparkling water or flat water.. we opted for the flat, which was served in a decorative glass long necked bottle. \n\nWhen she came back, about 5 minutes later, we knew what we wanted: The husband had a bowl of hot & sour soup and General Miao (?)'s chicken. Me, I ordered the Wonton Soup and the crispy baked chicken.  I was advised that the chicken would take about 20 minutes, if that was ok. It was.  We also ordered a pot of Jasmine pearl tea.\n\nThe soups were delivered separately, his first, mine about 4 minutes later.  The husband really liked his, mine.. it could have used salt or soy, neither of which was on the table. \n\nWhen the mains came out, same thing... separately, as if they were different courses, but I knew to expect that mine would be later.  The husband's food was beautifully presented. The red and green of the peppers contrasted prettily with the golden skin of of the chicken.  It also came with a couple of dipping sauces.  I was worried that it might be too spicy for me, but it wasn't.  It had really good flavour.\n\nWhen mine came out, it had been chopped prettily, a powered plum sauce was in a small dish and there was some chopped ginger off to the side. The chicken had a lovely flavour but it was a tad dry. I ate about 1/2 of what was on the plate, sharing some with my husband. \n\nWe opted for dessert, something we're not want to do often these days, but I couldn't resist the Sugar egg puffs with three dipping sauces: Vanilla bean whipped cream, Dark Chocolate and Raspberry coulis. LORDY! This was the highlight of the meal. They were light and hot, and the sauces, either alone or mixed really brought the whole thing to life. \n\nI might come back, the prices were a bit steep, but the flavours were nice.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-04-25"}, {"excerpts": ["We started out with the steamed BBQ pork bao and the jasmine pearl tea.

China. I'd rave about the crab feast that 3 friends and I got with the scissor cut noodles, numerous sides, and affordable but delicious wine bottles. \n\nMy visit yesterday, granted we didn't do a shared crab dinner, was so disappointing. My dining partner and I ordered the pickle plate as an appetizer when our server first came to the table, along with their Mango Mule beverage - a non-alcoholic drink that sounded fresh and delicious but tasted like a too tart blend of a dash of ginger ale and a powdered drink mix packet. For $5, it was not something I would recommend or order again\n\nWe sat for a bit and then ordered the crispy tofu app, a side of brown rice, and the \"spicy\" portobello mushroom dish from the vegetarian section. We were bummed that the only vegetarian noodle dish they have is a soup and they aren't able to make any of their other noodle dishes into a vegetarian version.\n\nWe were waiting and waiting and waiting and saw tables around us get their food- tables that came in after we'd already ordered get their food. Unfortunately, it was difficult to flag down a server, though there were so many running around a restaurant that was a third empty. A part of me thinks they were short staffed that day, which happens, of course, but it felt like our table in particular was the 'dropped ball'.\n\nAfter a roughly 20-minute wait, our entree comes out. I ask about the pickles that we'd ordered well before everything else with our drinks. The food runner seemed confused but still said it was coming... after 20 minutes? after the entree? after the other hot appetizer that also hasn't come out? Why does a small, cold plate take longer than everything else?\n\nHe ends up taking the entree back with him, so now we're back to having no food. A few more minutes pass, we're confused, were nervous that now they're just going to scrape together the pickle plate and then come back and serve us a cold entree. \n\nWe flag down someone to ask them to just cancel the pickle plate but it seems like he doesn't understand. He sends our server over who now drops off our hot appetizer, the crispy tofu. I ask him to cancel the pickles since they hadn't come and explain about the weird appearance of our entree and then disappearance of it and the server's response was, 'oh you wanted the pickles as an appetizer?\" in an actually pretty snide can't-admit-that-he's-wrong way. As if the blame is on me, the customer, to tell the server that the cold dish listed under their \"small plates\" menu that we ordered with our drinks before any food, that I want it to come before our entrees. \n\nWhy would anyone order a dish first, with their drinks, and expect it to come out after their dinner? As if the cold pickle plate is ordered as a dessert. No. That never happens. You forgot it- someone forgot it. And instead of just admitting it after 25 minutes, or comping the $6 dish, which would have been appropriate, you tried to place the blame on your table and then just say, 'Ok, I'll hold the order so it doesn't get made'. Like, DUDE, it's been 25 minutes. No need to press, 'hold', it's not f*cking coming and I'm not an idiot. At least have enough sense to throw the kitchen under the bus for your mistake and not your customer. \n\nSo we never got the pickles, nor did we get an apology for how they were forgotten. We eventually got our crispy tofu and that was fine. Not stellar and the dipping sauce was super pedestrian. I liked the potpourri of jalapeno bits and spicy stuff on the plate, but for the price this is a completely skippable dish. \n\nOur entree, surprise surprise, came back out shorty after. Lukewarm with the rice being straight up cold. The portion is small, the dish labeled as spicy wasn't spicy in the least, and the texture of the portobellos wasn't appetizing at all. So tough and squeaky and you felt like you were somehow chewing gristle and not mushrooms. The dish was our server's recommendation and I can't second that opinion. It was ok, but not great and if that's the best veg dish they have... well, maybe just don't have vegetarian dishes because its clearly not something you care about. \n\nI'm bummed that M.Y. China doesn't offer the selection or service it once did and that my dinner on Valentine's Day (though not for Valentine's Day) was such a sad experience.

Perfectly seared scallops that was complemented well by the vinaigrette. \n\nMatsutake Soup with chicken, dried scallop, ham and wolfberry.  A full flavored traditional soup, which reminded me of soup that my Mom made. \n\nSpicy Sichaun lamp chop with forbidden rice, crispy noodle, gai lan, Sichuan bean sauce.  Though listed as spicy, the chop had only a hint of spice. The crispy noodles under the chop seemed out of place with this as it falls out of the plate as you're cutting the chop.  The Gai Lan were plain and needed some oil and soy/oyster sauce. The forbidden rice which consisted of red and brown rice and barley was tasty. \n\nSurf and turf - wagyu beef, jasmine tea smoked seabass, yang zhou fried rice, black pepper sauce. This was delicious dish. The honey glazed seabass was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The beef was tender and tasty with the black pepper sauce. The scoop of yang zhou rice with bbq pork, egg, mushroom and shrimp was good. \n\nMatcha tiramisu in a caramel sugar cloud.  The sugar cloud is made of spun sugar made for a dramatic presentation. You need to slowly collapse the cloud into the dessert or set it aside to eat the tiramisu, which was not like your typical tiramisu. \n\nThough located at a mall, the MY China's food is not mall fare.

We had to wait about 5 minutes or so pass our reservation time, but at least we got a photo opp with Martin Yan himself while we were waiting by the front.  He definitely knows how to entertain as he was explaining the noodle making process to part of the restaurant.  And he walks around to some tables as well (including ours a couple times).
