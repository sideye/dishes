Mostly Japanese cuisine, with a few Chinese dishes, too. (No sushi.) Rice bowls, ramen soup, cold ramen, yakisoba, curry rice, salads and more. \n\nStarted with the deep fried platter. Egg rolls, wings, chicken nuggets and fish cake. Fish cake = favorite, followed by the chicken wings. \n\nPremium hand made pork ramen, added one soft boiled egg, and it was perfect for me.  Ramen is topped with woodear mushrooms (black fungus), scallions, and bean sprouts for crunch.  Ramen was cooked perfectly and delicious. Broth is addicting.  Thick but tender sliced pork.  Worth trying.\n\nPickles combo (kimchi and seaweed salad). Chilled, tangy and the perfect accompaniment for piping hot bowls of ramen.  \n\nService = friendly.  Clean tables. Five 4-tops and four 2-tops, so if you're a large group, plan accordingly.  Free Wi-Fi for paying customers. \n\nPrices = moderate.  Two bowls of ramen, two appetizers, and two drinks for $40.00 (pre-tip). \n\nGlad to find ramen closer to home!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-10-16"}], "age dashi": [{"excerpts": ["Ramen, Age dashi dofu, some cooked item sushi rolls etc. "], "author": "Matsuo U.", "review": "I really wanted this place to be good.\n\nMy friends say not to give a bad review to small joint like this. Why I say? They think it is a negative on people who are just trying to make a living. Well, my review nor the fake 5 star reviews for this joint really won't impact their success as much as their food and service. Having tried one of their 21 Tastes, won't be back to \"double down\" and increase my odds of having a good hand, ahh meant \"meal\".  (for those who missed it, that was a reference to the card game \"21\")\n\nSo here I's go.\n\nThe food\n\nIt ain't good. Thought the broiled pork chop on rice was a safe bet. Nope. It was pieces of pork cooked with oyster sauce & soy sauce and onions in a bowl over rice. The meat tasted as if it had been recently thawed from the era of the Ming Dynasty, dipped in sauce and fried.  Some of the white onions were the skin peal, too tough to eat. It was bad. It was short grained rice, but a low quality.Very interesting that this was one of the lunch \"Bento Specials\". \n\nRamen was the other dish at our table. Seemed like a miso base. Noodles were egg noodles. Just something very odd about the flavor. About as Japanese as Mushu Pork or Egg Fu Young.\n\nChinese tea pre-brewed in \"da big pot\".\n\nThe Service\n\nNice & pleasant. Smiling waitresses. Was super attentive to keep the plastic tea cup filled.\n\nThe Digs\n\n21 Taste House has a veneer (very thin) of Japanese restaurant. Some items on the menu that are Japanese. Ramen, Age dashi dofu, some cooked item sushi rolls etc. The decor is a mix of Japanese wall hanging bamboo vases - the 99 cent version.\n\nThe question & philosophy\n\nWhy not just be what you are, serve food that you know with descriptions that are accurate? Drop the Japanese veneer and be at one with the I Ching and you might start to hear that register ring.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-10-15"}], "pieces sesame wings": [], "pieces teba fry": [], "pieces whole deep fried soft shell crab": [], "tonkotsu ramen rich": [], "pieces saba shioyaki": [], "hakata tonkotsu ramen": [], "snow crab tonkotsu": [], "snow crab hakata tonkotsu": [], "snow crab shoyu": [], "snow crab miso": [], "spicy kimchi and beef fried rice": [], "unagi fried rice with teriyaki sauce": [], "teriyaki chicken fried rice": [], "homemade spicy tonkotsu ramen": [], "tan tan ramen combo": [{"excerpts": ["I ordered the Tan Tan Ramen Combo - $11 ", "(Rating: 4/5)\n", "The amount of flavor and the texture of the noodles are good enough to satisfy my ramen craving even though as I mentioned before, it's definitely not an authentic ramen spot.

The meats and broth were really tasty and had lots of flavor. I came here not expecting much but I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it.\n\nCrispy Octopus Balls (Takoyaki) - $5.95 for 8 pieces (Rating: 3.75/5)\nPiping hot and fresh! 8 pieces for $5.95? I consider that a pretty good deal in the city. The filling was nice and creamy and had at least 2 pieces of octopus in there. Nicely crunchy and topped with bonito flakes that were still moving.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Original Lobster Tonkatsu Ramen $10.75. It comes with lobster, roasted pork, pork shoulder meat, kikurage mushrooms, a little crab, half a seasoned soft-boiled egg, quail eggs, spinach, etc. He said it was good but not great. I tasted the broth and the broth was pretty tasty. You can kinda tell the seafood isn't completely fresh. I don't recommend getting this if you can get itchy from non-fresh seafood.\n\nFor the price, I think it's a good spot if you just need a simple ramen fix that's tasty.
