My favorite dish on tonight's dinner. I am not much of a dessert person however since it's my first visit here I had to try few things on the menu. Pork belly with Chinese broccoli was very good, a bit salty side however it was savory with brown rice and enjoyed the fresh crunchy Chinese broccoli! \n\nPenang red curry with beef was flavorful and perfect consistency of creamy coconut milk.  A bit sweet but I can tell you that  it was definitely one of few good Thai curry dishes in S.F  Also Beer and wine choices are excellent!  It's a bit high priced Thai food compared to other restaurants near by.  Happy hour drink price would be a bit better appealing if they focus more on the food sale. \n\nI'll be back to try few more things soon.
