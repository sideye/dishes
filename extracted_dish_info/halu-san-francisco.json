(If you want crazy: try the Castro and other areas.. or go to DTSJ like San Pedro Square). It was really nice not dealing with crazy people. We did walk to a local bar while we waited for our spot here (they said about 30 minutes and they called us). \n\nIt's a very small establishment with Beatle's memorabilia all over the place and Beatle's music playing in the background. I really like this place. My cousin and his girlfriend LOVE this place, but my other cousin has never gone. And it is sadly closed on Sundays (we were trying to go last Sunday after trying out couches at Living Spaces). So we did a raincheck and went last night.  \n\n-\n\nAnyways to the food..\n\n2nd experience:\n\nI ordered the beef tongue (comes in a set of two skewers). It was really good. And I appreciated that it was prepared differently than the beef tongue that I would also receive in my dinner set mentioned below. My dinner set was randomized so I didn't know I would be getting the 'same' thing, but it wasn't remotely the same. So thumbs up. \n\n------\n\nI also got the Yakitori Omakase Dinner which is one of their specials: \n7 assorted yakitori skewers (chef's choice so it varies on any given day)\n\nMy assortments came with a delicious beef tongue, \nplum soaked beef with herbs (that was my favorite), \norka (everyone loved this, but I thought it was okay),\npork (my cousin Kyle's favorite, but I'm not huge on charcoaled meats),\nmushrooms (super delicious), \nchicken meatball, and \nsalmon (my cousin Syd's favorite and it was good but it's not my go-to).\n\n*beef tounge isn't as chewy as the leunga of a burritto so if you were wondering on texture, I can't do super chewy meats, I think if you've never had tounge: it's a good starting dish to get here. It's really good.\n\nThe dinner comes is served with rice, miso soup and organic spring green mix salad.  The miso is really good here, they make it different than any place I've ever been too. They have enokitake mushrooms in their miso and it's not a super salty broth or anything, it's just dead-on good. \n\n**veggie choice available for the assortments \n\n--------\n\nWe also got Okonomiyaki (japanese style pizza pancake topped with traditional tonkatsu sauce, mayo, aonori and red ginger), it's vegetarian, very similar to a Korean seafood/non-seafood pancake.

The ramens were good.

But after 35 mins we still haven't got our table, so we went in and were told we would be the next party, then it took another 15 mins until we were finally seated... Granted we were asked to leave a phone number so they could call us when table's ready, but the extended waiting time was just too long compared with what we were quoted\n\n* * * FOOD * * *\nSpinach Salad: A-.\nA tiny appetizer recommended by our server, the spinach was fresh but it was the sauce that made the difference. It was peanut + miso kind of taste, good start of our meal.\n\nTontoro Skewer: A.\nCrunchy and tender, one of the best grilled pork belly I have ever had. Each piece of pork belly had an equal fat/meat ratio, the grilling time was just about right that the meat was still very juicy when it was served.\n\nChicken Skewer: A-.\nNothing surprising here but good quality of chicken meat and the addition of avocado was a nice match to the oily/greasy meat.\n\nGyutoro Skewer: A.\nThe beef belly was not as crunchy as pork belly, but definitely a lot more tender and juicy. Again the grilling time here was controlled very well. Some kind of sauce was put on the meat before it was served which made this dish even more delicious.\n\nChicken Katsu Skewer: A-.\nQuite an interesting skewer. Grilling a fried stuff seems to be an extra step and I couldn't really taste the grilling part of it anyway. There was some onion inside the chicken katsu too.\n\nGrilled Eggplant: B.\nQuite disappointed. Very bland even with the addition of ginger. Should have come with soy sauce instead.\n\nOkonomiyaki: A-.\nNice texture and very tasty, flavorful sauce. Not too thick. I was hoping there could be more green onion to enhance the taste even more though. Definitely a must-order dish.\n\nChicken Stuffed Mushroom: A-.\nAnother recommendation from our server. There was just a tiny bit of chicken meat in each piece of mushroom, but the combination of both was rather interesting.\n\nGeso Age: A-.\nThe squid legs were deep fried in just about the right amount of time, not too crunchy while the squid was still very tender. The sauce was once again very flavorful.\n\nSatisfied with almost all the dishes ordered!

In contrast, Halu's vintage diner ambiance and whimsical decor of Beatles paraphernalia makes me feel as if I had walked straight into a local joint tucked into alleyways in Japan.

Although I still think the kara-age would be best on the side, I do commend the ramen here! The noodles are thin and bouncy, and unlike noodles typically found at ramen places (I suspect it's housemade or from Japan!) The broth is solid, a perfect balance of a nice robust flavor without being too thick and heavy.\n\n(+) Hiyashi chaku ($14): Not terrible, but I would pass. First of all, the plate is oval which looks pretty but makes it very difficult to mix all the ingredients together. Secondly, the chashu portions are a bit skimpy because the slices are very very thin.

However, my mother had different ideas.  She felt that Japantown is a little out of our way, despite the fact that I know the ins and outs of the area very well.  I didn't want to argue with her anymore about it, so we chose a place that was a little closer to home -- low and behold, we found Halu.\n\nWhen we first walked in, I was actually a bit shocked of the decor for a Japanese restaurant.  It was a very rinky dinky place, with decor from the 1960s (i.e.: Beatlemania).  Although I'm not opposed to anything from the 50s and 60s, I found it redundant, considering that so many Beatles fans have vilified Yoko Ono as the woman who broke up the band.\n\nTo add more fuel to the fire, I felt that the food was nowhere near superb.  I've had okonomiyaki before, and for the price we paid for our meals, I tasted more \"pancake\" than anything else.

Okonomiyaki is supposed to be a savory dish, and there was nothing appetizing about their version of it.\n\nThe reason why I gave this place a 2 is because despite the fact that the food wasn't to our liking, they definitely get points for their customer service; their waitresses were very kind and welcoming.  Originally when we walked in, the door was open, and where we were seated, we felt a really cold draft.  In an attempt to change seats with my mother, one of the waitresses noticed, and asked me if I wanted the door closed.  I said, \"yes\", and she did just that.  She was also very nice to allow us to take up one of their tables while we were waiting for our order to be boxed and bagged.\n\nOther than the good customer service, I would suggest that if you really want a taste of some real okonomiyaki to take a trip to Japantown.

Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, as the Beatles-theme of this hole in the wall definitely offers a certain uniqueness that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. \n\nHowever, this was sadly the most memorable aspect of our meal. While the food certainly wasn't poor, it remained largely unremarkable and if it weren't for its funky Beatles-theme, I may have forgotten about Halu altogether. \n\nFor starters, the wait time between arrival and actual food consumption is incredibly long. The restaurant is tiny, so it's almost guaranteed a table won't be readily available when you come. Combined with the snail's pace the kitchen maintains, a trip to Halu can be a pretty arduous one. \n\nWait time aside, the food was only middle of the line for me. I came to Halu for three reasons: (1) Bacon Wrapped Mochi (2) Okonomiyaki (3) Ramen. Unfortunately, none of these dishes excelled. \n\nBacon Wrapped Mochi - After months of fantasizing about it , I was super excited to finally sink my teeth into some. However, I was pretty disappointed with the real deal. While the texture of crispy bacon paired nicely with the the soft chewiness of mochi, Halu's was super greasy and on the bland side. \n\nSeafood Okonomiyaki - It took close to 1.5 hours to make; however, the final product didn't quite justify the long preparation time. It was tasty enough and the amount of seafood in it was generous, but the pancake itself was a little burnt. After sitting on the table for a while, it hardened to a cracker-like texture. So, try to eat it immediately, while it's still warm and kind of soft!\n\nRamen - This was the biggest disappointment. I opted for the Corn Butter one while my friends got the Lava and Spicy Karage Ramen. The annoying thing was that they staggered the timing of our ramen. The first two bowls came out together, but the third bowl didn't come out until 30 minutes later. As for the ramen itself, the noodles tasted like the instant kind and didn't have the springy texture that I prefer. The broth was nothing special. Too salty in my opinion. Also, if you have an aversion to spicy foods like I do, stay clear of the Lava and Spicy Karage Ramen. Even my friends who love spicy foods had a hard time getting these down. \n\nOverall, I might be willing to come here again.

It was different alright. I have driven by a zillion times and never noticed the place until I read the reviews. I arrived @ 5.15pm and from the outside, it looked dark and dingy like there were some construction works going on inside. The sign at the front door still said \"closed\" and the frontage looked uninviting. The inside though was quite cute. The walls were adorned with Beatles paraphernalia, posters of the Grateful Dead, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Signs of a bygone era like \"Love\", \"Peace\" and \"End of War\" were posted in the restaurant. The inside had a funky vibe and the ambience was like an old English pub. it also looked somewhat like my old college dorm! The atmosphere was incompatible with the kind of food they served though I don't mean it in a bad way. I found out that the reason for the upbeat hippie look. The yakitori chef (owner?) was a musician before and obviously a big Beatles fan.\n\nThe decor did bring back some fond memories of the 60s and 70s but the food didn't quite measure up. My biggest disappointment was the chashu ramen. The chashu smelled obnoxious and was a big turnoff. It smelled of pig's urine. Damn! This was the second time in three months that I was served with stinky chashu. My other experience was in Great Eastern in Chinatown. The bad pork spoiled the broth as well and my complaint to the server just fell on deaf ears. I can understand once in a while the shipment of pork they buy might be bad but I can't condone or understand how the chef could have failed to detect this and continue serving it to their customers. A big thumbs down on this one.  \n\nI always order skewer/yakitori items whenever i dined in an izakaya place. I am not sure why I picked the basic yakitori fare like chicken liver, chicken gizzard, shitake, stuffed mushroom and salmon yaki onigiri for the evening. They were not bad but were not great either. In addition, I tried the tako wasabi which had good flavor and did give my jaw a good work out. On hindsight, I am sure what I ordered were not their best.

We intended to go to Kukje, but people were on CPT so we instead took the opportunity to cross this restaurant off the to-eat list. Even before entering, you know this place has spunk. The canopy says \"A Different Japanese Restaurant\" and the door has \"no sushi today (or tomorrow)\" and \"sushi free zone\" signs on it. The format is sign up and wait, but rather than a communal clipboard for soon-to-be diners, the list seemed to be managed mentally by the servers.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening, we were lucky enough to catch a table upon arrival due to the people before us on the list being neither present nor reachable by phone. Seating was quite limited, with 6 or 7 bar seats and about that many tables. We sat immediately by the door. If you're at the door table with a large(ish) person, I recommend seating them on the side of the table away from the door. As it was, the back of my chair was sometimes getting hit by the door, and a few times my elbow brushed passersby. The many people waiting mostly left and checked back later or waited outside.\n\nBeatles, Beatles, this place is absolutely crawling with Beatles. I hope you like them and I hope you've brushed up on your Beatles edition Rock Band. Beatles music plays from the psychedelic Beatles movie on the screen above the door. Posters are all over the walls and memorabilia crowds the bar top.\n\nAll this eye candy kept us busy during the long, drawn-out time it took for our order to be fulfilled in bits and pieces. The place was packed and something like two people were working the stove, so expect to be patient between ordering and getting your food. We ordered 5 kinds of skewers (chicken heart, beef tongue, pork jowl, bacon-wrapped asparagus x 2, and okra), veggie okonomiyaki (similar to pajeon), veggie don, some beverages, and later red bean ice cream. The skewers arrived in several waves. As described in the menu, it indeed took a while for the okonomiyaki to be prepared. Somehow, it was this wait plus even more time before the veggie don (which I see as a much simpler dish) appeared. Keep in mind that the tiny kitchen was cranking out dishes for everyone in the packed restaurant.\n\nThe food was, in a word, good. Picture in your mind - and mouth - much savory tastiness, and very slowly reread the food items I listed in our order. Imagine. Concentrate. Whatever feelings you had while doing that, that's how good the dishes were. The okonomiyaki included a faint scent x taste that I couldn't name, and I think it was from the combination of the herbs and fixin's on it. I liked the crisp blackened areas on the top and bottom. We took only three \"issues\" with the food. Some of the salted skewers were a bit too salty for my friend, but my friend did appreciate the distinctiveness of the specially prepared house salt. Also, the menu listed the veggie don as being over brown rice, but our rice was white. The third thing I noted was that everything seemed oily: the meats, the vegetables, by association the rice - everything. I realize it all had been made on the same greasy stove. Just be ready for it is what I'm saying.\n\nFrom the time we arrived to the time we departed (and afterward), the workers were more than nice. Friendly, patient, recommending, suggesting, describing... you know, the qualities and actions you want in people who are creating your meal experience. It was a pair of waitresses serving us, but the one who showed up more than the other was animated in her lively talk of the dishes. For example, the don bowl came and its recipient wondered how they'd eat it, as they only had chopsticks. My friend took this somewhat literally and asked our server how to eat the dish. Our server took this to another level and, along with hand gestures, told us her personal process of scooping a bit from one side, scooping some from the other, digging further to get the rice, etc.. This was after a showy recommendation of ways our table could mix up or split the dish to share it. Also, props to our servers and cooks for their flexibility when, about 20 minutes after ordering, we remembered we'd wanted the okonomiyaki sans mayo.\n\nI say the people were still nice after we left because, on our way to our car, we passed by one of the cooks who was hanging out on the sidewalk drinking a hot beverage. They had a friendly conversation with us, friendly even to the point of bowing way too many times. You know how it is.

Immediately I noticed the decor--this place was packed with Beatles memorabilia, and other bands as well--a Jimi Hendrix poster hung on the high wall over the front-of-house kitchen, a couple of Who posters--but mostly the Beatles. There was even a drum kit on a tiny balcony over the entrance, which looked possibly only just large enough to host a three-piece band, should one ever want to perform a rock concert in the tiny space. Despite the obvious theme, there was nothing precious or kitschy-seeming about the place--it felt like you were in someone's home, albeit someone who had a thing for classic rock posters.

Last night's meal tasted even better than I remember even though I've had most of the same grilled items before. Even without bacon wrapped everything, the meats and vegetables are perfectly seasoned. You can see the \"good salt\" sprinkled on the beautifully presented skewers. When I skewer meat, it's never that pretty... I would never attempt to butterfly a chicken wing. Other delicious grilled items include stuffed mushrooms, shishito peppers (apparently only 1 of 5 are actually hot), and I always forget what those little silver fish that always seem to be pregnant are called. \n\nAnd when the small yakitori items are not enough, we always order a bowl of the chashu ramen. Delicious chewy noodles with piping hot broth. And really what sent me there was Omar's review of their new okonomiyaki (no curry last night). How many places in the bay area actually have this?

Last night they were playing the Beatles' early Motown cover songs.

Well, they get everything right, EXCEPT the food.

I'm not entirely sure what a gizzard is, but it sure tastes good when prepared on their grill. Its got a texture similar to liver, but with a little more bite, and possibly more gamey. \n\nDrink Pick: Echigo. It's like Singapore's Tiger beer, but a bit less hoppy and a little more sweet.

Instead she said, \"there's this Japanese place around the corner, I've never been, do you want to check it out?\" I am game to try new spots, so we skipped on over to 8th and Clement to discover a small restaurant (I think hole-in-the-wall is an exaggeration unless you're talking Yamo-sized) which seemed packed but happened to have a table for two, and bar space as well for the people who came in after us.\n\nThe servers were very friendly, and seated us right away. Immediately I noticed the decor--this place was packed with Beatles memorabilia, and other bands as well--a Jimi Hendrix poster hung on the high wall over the front-of-house kitchen, a couple of Who posters--but mostly the Beatles. There was even a drum kit on a tiny balcony over the entrance, which looked possibly only just large enough to host a three-piece band, should one ever want to perform a rock concert in the tiny space. Despite the obvious theme, there was nothing precious or kitschy-seeming about the place--it felt like you were in someone's home, albeit someone who had a thing for classic rock posters. The vibe was totally friendly too... the servers seemed like they were down-to-earth, but there was no slacking when it came to attentiveness. \n\nWe were presented with an enormous menu, which, along with the specials list(s) and many handwritten labels for items on the wall, contained such wonders as \"Avochick\" or chicken thigh skewers with spicy guac, a savory fried butter mochi wrapped in nori, an array of yakitori items, several ramen options, ochazuke, okonomiyaki, and other intriguing specialties. I was pretty excited.\n\nOnce we finally made up our minds, we ordered yakitori, kara age \"don don,\" and the butter mochi appetizer. Everything came out pretty quickly, even though the restaurant was full, and my friend and I enjoyed catching up and checking out the scenery in the meantime. The rad server even offered an suggestion for how my friend could eat her meat (\"like a popsicle\") when she noticed my friend having trouble getting everything off the bone. The food runner (who maybe also was the chef?) presented everything formally and gave us the Japanese names. \n\nOh and the food? Super delicious... homey in presentation but served on super cute plates (apparently bought from the restaurant supply place around the corner) and succulent. Butter mochi? Buttery. Kara age? Light and with a small flavorful salad and scoop of rice for a totally satisfying meal. I didn't try my friend's yakitori but she practically licked her plate clean so I'm thinking that it was bomb. \n\nOur total bill, including tip, was $40, not bad for a fully satisfying, unpretentious, fun izakaya experience in SF, and with leftovers to boot.

I really like this place. My cousin and his girlfriend LOVE this place, but my other cousin has never gone.

Let It Be.\n\nHalu is a very good place not only for the food, but also because it's one of those cozy places you can bring a gaggle of people and have a grand old time.  It's a little short on the beer and sake selection for an Izakaya, but you'll get by With A Little Help From [your] Friends.\n\nOn this day, my Better Half and the Little Man accompanied me.  We were given three seats in a row at the bar.  We did have to wait what seemed like a Long, Long, Long time, but it really was just a few minutes.  The restaurant was packed that day, so the delay can be forgiven.  The waitress and everyone there was very friendly and kind, and all in all, the atmosphere is like a Yellow Submarine.\n\nWife and I ordered the Charsu-men.  Ah, the little Piggies who gave us their succulent souls to accompany our noodles.  Nice, fatty pork might be the best food in the world, but mix that with noodles, and it's heaven.  The broth was very flavorful, thick and rich, the noodles had an excellent consistency albeit slightly soft (preference really).\n\nMay be even better than the ramen though was the yakitori.  We ordered the Chicken Hearts, Flat Iron Steak, Short Ribs and Chicken Thighs.  All were very good.  It was a lot of food, and I Should Have Known Better, but never do.  We finished it off.  The Little Man was amazing.  He scarfed down that food like it was water.  There's definitely Something in the way the little dude can put it down.\n\nAll in all, it's one of the places I would love to go after a Hard Day's Night of work.  Grab a beer, a sake and order up some food with your friends.  In a lot of ways, it reminds me of my college days, I remember that like Yesterday, hanging out, having a good time, enjoying good food and good drink in a cozy atmosphere.

The sign at the front door still said \"closed\" and the frontage looked uninviting. The inside though was quite cute. The walls were adorned with Beatles paraphernalia, posters of the Grateful Dead, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Signs of a bygone era like \"Love\", \"Peace\" and \"End of War\" were posted in the restaurant.

I prefer a little crispier tofu but all in all, this was a solid dish.  My ramen, however, was very average.

Small seating and slow service due to Mom doing the cooking while the daughters provide the service but very charming. Chicken Kaarage Ramen was yummy. The noodles are thinner than what I'm used to but a nice bite. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy and accompanied the bean sprouts and green onions in the ramen. We also ordered various yakitori (pork jowl, gizzards and chicken skin) which were good but salty. We ordered a beer to go with the yakitori and it was a perfect combination.
