The only reason I didn't give this place a five star rating (\"As good as it gets!\") is that I have never tried any other Egyptian restaurant, nor have I been to Egypt, so I cannot make a fair comparison on whether what I ate was authentic and as good as it gets. What I DO know is that everything was DELICIOUS. With that said...\n\nMy friend and I arrived at 5:45PM on a Thursday evening (admittedly an early dinner), with a $40 off coupon I had bought on Amazon Local. At 5:45PM we were the first ones in the place, and the only ones there until about 6:30PM, and our server was most attentive and sweet. It's a very small place, somewhat dimly lit but with fun, interesting Egyptian-esque decor. The place felt very warm and inviting - I think it's a family run establishment, and it felt very personal to be there. On the exterior, despite the bright blue sign, the restaurant is easy to miss, sort of stuffed between two dull residential buildings, and without windows you almost question what exactly is going on in there...\n\nWe started with two appetizers: the Hummus Bil Tahina and the Zabadi Bil Toom. Entrees ordered were the chicken kebab, Kebab Firakh (my friend's) and the layered eggplant with ground beef, Musa'ah Bil Lahma (mine). My entree in particular was HUGE and as much as I wanted to, I could not finish it and had to bring it home. This did not stop me from ordering dessert, however. Desserts vary each day but last night's order was of a honey cake and a plate of coconut covered, doughnut hole looking things (\"fingers\" they were called), that were both wonderful. \n\nAs we arrived at 5:45PM and had a leisurely dinner, we got to enjoy the short belly dancing show that began at 7:30PM. Per the restaurant, the shows are at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30PM. It was a fun way to savor our dessert and enjoy a little entertainment. \n\nI took a quick look at the complaints people made (you can't please everyone!) and some of them are a bit ridiculous. Overpriced? With three glasses of wine between us, the bill after sales tax came to about $94. Apps average about $5-8, entrees $20-25, desserts $4-5. This is SAN FRANCISCO and this is NORMAL. The menu not having much variety? It's a small establishment, probably seats about 50 total, and I feel like the lack of variety is overshadowed by the quality of the food. Yes there are only 9 entree options on the menu (and maybe one daily special) - if you can't make a choice among 10 items, maybe you're better off going to TGI Fridays!\n\nOverall, a great experience and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking to try something a little different.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-19"}], "baba ghannuug": [{"excerpts": [", baba ghannuug (eggplant), zabadi bil toom (yogurt cheese and garlic with cucumber), and wara enab zeit (stuffed grape leaves).

"], "author": "Jen D.", "review": "I have to admit I'm quite surprised that this place has an average three star rating. The only reason I didn't give this place a five star rating (\"As good as it gets!\") is that I have never tried any other Egyptian restaurant, nor have I been to Egypt, so I cannot make a fair comparison on whether what I ate was authentic and as good as it gets. What I DO know is that everything was DELICIOUS. With that said...\n\nMy friend and I arrived at 5:45PM on a Thursday evening (admittedly an early dinner), with a $40 off coupon I had bought on Amazon Local. At 5:45PM we were the first ones in the place, and the only ones there until about 6:30PM, and our server was most attentive and sweet. It's a very small place, somewhat dimly lit but with fun, interesting Egyptian-esque decor. The place felt very warm and inviting - I think it's a family run establishment, and it felt very personal to be there. On the exterior, despite the bright blue sign, the restaurant is easy to miss, sort of stuffed between two dull residential buildings, and without windows you almost question what exactly is going on in there...\n\nWe started with two appetizers: the Hummus Bil Tahina and the Zabadi Bil Toom. Entrees ordered were the chicken kebab, Kebab Firakh (my friend's) and the layered eggplant with ground beef, Musa'ah Bil Lahma (mine). My entree in particular was HUGE and as much as I wanted to, I could not finish it and had to bring it home. This did not stop me from ordering dessert, however. Desserts vary each day but last night's order was of a honey cake and a plate of coconut covered, doughnut hole looking things (\"fingers\" they were called), that were both wonderful. \n\nAs we arrived at 5:45PM and had a leisurely dinner, we got to enjoy the short belly dancing show that began at 7:30PM. Per the restaurant, the shows are at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30PM. It was a fun way to savor our dessert and enjoy a little entertainment. \n\nI took a quick look at the complaints people made (you can't please everyone!) and some of them are a bit ridiculous. Overpriced? With three glasses of wine between us, the bill after sales tax came to about $94. Apps average about $5-8, entrees $20-25, desserts $4-5. This is SAN FRANCISCO and this is NORMAL. The menu not having much variety? It's a small establishment, probably seats about 50 total, and I feel like the lack of variety is overshadowed by the quality of the food. Yes there are only 9 entree options on the menu (and maybe one daily special) - if you can't make a choice among 10 items, maybe you're better off going to TGI Fridays!\n\nOverall, a great experience and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking to try something a little different.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-19"}], "basterma": [{"excerpts": ["The Basterma appetizer was also good."], "author": "Hiroshi K.", "review": "This place deserves more than 3 stars.

My date's Fuul Midimas was SCALDING hot, after 10 minutes of cooling and much stirring, still uncomfortably hot, it was OK, but NOT worth the interminable wait to be able to eat it. The owner says it comes off the stove at that temperature, I doubt it highly, it came out of the MICROWAVE at that temperature, and the cook screwed up. I sincerely doubt the Department of Public Health demands it be served hot enough to burn your mouth. My Gambari Mashwi was good, a dozen prawns and a mountain of mushy rice, and a spicy sweet pea dish for $22.00. \n\nThe dancers were good, had nice stage presence, all two of them. \n\nThe bill finally came after asking not one, not two, but THREE times. During the 23 minute wait for the check the party of three left, one diner was being served dinner, and three dancers-drinkers in the whole place. Not the brightest time to make a diner wait, with the place virtually empty, and a staff of three servers. I always tip generously; I usually get good or excellent service. This time I was willing to leave only 10-15%, I wanted to send a message. She actually added the tip for herself!! On the menu it says 18% will be added to parties of 5, another place it says parties of 6!! However were a party of TWO! She added it in, and ran it on the credit card without my consent. I usually leave CASH, which most servers prefer, but I understand why she added it without our consent, she knew she ignored us, and given super-sub par service!  We were not about to contest it, we did not want to deal with her anymore - get me out of here! Never again! Now we understand why the place was empty.

She invited me to watch the live performances on Sunday and I had a great time. I believe she told me the chef isn't from Egypt but learned to cook there (don't quote me on that). Food isn't out of this world but tastes like a decent homemade versus a friendly restaurant. Plus it's buffet style which is nice. Service was friendly though we weren't checked up on much (though it's possibly due to our awkward location).\n\nMy friend and I were seated at the table closest to the door so I did have a slightly awkward angle but on the bright side that also meant I wasn't approached by the dancers who were gorgeous and talented but I'm an awkward potato and don't want to interact with strangers.\n\nParking in the area is a bit difficult. Even on a Sunday we had to go up and down every block looking for a spot until we finally found one a few blocks away. I was a little worried because the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. A few tables were filled but otherwise there were a few musicians, an open buffet, and only a few guests. However over time the night picked up. At no point was there a flood of people out the door but between the employees, dancers, musicians, and guests there was a festive and fun atmosphere that I really enjoyed. However, I would have felt very awkward coming here alone or with people that aren't already familiar with the business because it felt like a very intimate atmosphere.\n\nAs for the food, I'm speaking as someone with limited knowledge about Egyptian food. My friend has some knowledge and approves but I don't always see eye to eye with her. From my limited knowledge I felt like the food was fine. It tasted like homemade food. Like someone's mom really wanted to give it her all at the school potluck. Some items were overcooked but at least they weren't shy with the seasoning.\n\n-Hummus was decent though the pita was a bit tough\n-Musa'ah Bil Lahma (Eggplant w/ ground beef, tomato, raisins, & nuts): Pretty tasty. Something that I feel like you can easily recreate at home but it's still a spiced and rather balanced dish that works well together\n-Al Masri Salad: Light acidic salad. Nice light item to go with the other items.\n-Vermicelli Rice Pilaf: I quite enjoyed this take on rice pilaf. The noodles add some interesting textures and as a whole it was almost buttery.\n-The main downfall items were the proteins. One of the chicken dishes was fairly juicy (I believe it was the Taggen Firakh) but the other chicken and fish dishes I got were very dry.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my experience here. The food was perfect but it was decent, the experience lasted more than a few hours, I left very full, and had a generally great time.

At 5:45PM we were the first ones in the place, and the only ones there until about 6:30PM, and our server was most attentive and sweet. It's a very small place, somewhat dimly lit but with fun, interesting Egyptian-esque decor. The place felt very warm and inviting - I think it's a family run establishment, and it felt very personal to be there. On the exterior, despite the bright blue sign, the restaurant is easy to miss, sort of stuffed between two dull residential buildings, and without windows you almost question what exactly is going on in there...\n\nWe started with two appetizers: the Hummus Bil Tahina and the Zabadi Bil Toom. Entrees ordered were the chicken kebab, Kebab Firakh (my friend's) and the layered eggplant with ground beef, Musa'ah Bil Lahma (mine).

The menu not having much variety? It's a small establishment, probably seats about 50 total, and I feel like the lack of variety is overshadowed by the quality of the food. Yes there are only 9 entree options on the menu (and maybe one daily special) - if you can't make a choice among 10 items, maybe you're better off going to TGI Fridays!\n\nOverall, a great experience and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking to try something a little different.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-19"}], "kabob harouf": [], "musaah bil lahma": [], "kufta mashwiya": [{"excerpts": ["Another dish that I recommend is Kufta mashwiya, it's lamb sausages served with a rice pyramid.
