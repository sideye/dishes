I think it says something if a restaurant has made it so long in a town like SF. Who can forget the garlic noodles (buttery, with good chew, and of course, garlicky - so not a first date food, wink wink) and the roasted crab. They do have 2 other types - tamarind and drunken but when I asked our waiter, which crab he said without hesitation, \"It's been 10 years? Yeah, roasted bec/ you'll wish it was if you order something else\". He was right. Was fantastic - finger lickin' good! I mean, I'm dabbing my fingers to catch some more bits of garlic, salt and pepper off the plate. Not good for the blood pressure. Anyway, we also had the following:\n\n- I had the Pear Martini (tasty, not in a big glass so I had to have another beverage)... and the Bellini Martini (also tasty)...\n- my friend had the Lychee martini (very good) and the caipirinha (true to form and I've had them in Rio and it was close)!\n- seafood cakes (comes with 5 and it's like golden fried fish cake)  with pickled beverages\n- grilled calamari with mustard sauce (several small squid grilled with nice char on the outside and nice and tender center) - very good. \n\nToo full for dessert... wish they had mango and sticky rice - my friend said they had it at their sister restaurant Thanh Long. \n\nOverall we were very satisfied and will surely go again someday (and I won't wait so long)!

I was honestly surprised by how flavorful and well balanced the dish was. Other entrees on the table included roast chicken, crab cakes, shaken beef, and the \"signature dish\" - roasted crab. Folks seemed to like the food. \n\nThey did bring out an ice cream dessert for the birthday boy, and then a second (somewhat begrudged) when they realized there were 2 birthday boys. \n\nIn summary, the food at Crustaceans is good, but not one-of-a-kind great. Is it worth to get \"dressed up\" for dinner here? My answer is no. Then again, their rules are so flexible a polo tee might suffice since its got a collar.

The ambiance is lovely and upscale; the service is impeccable, and the food is really incredible.  If you want a cheap hole-in-the-wall, this is definitely not the place for you, but I don't like cockroaches, and most of the other Vietnamese and Wharf places I've been to have them.  UGH.\n\nI've never found any flaws in the food.  The crab is tender and succulent, and the butter/garlic/pepper sauce Crustacean serves it in is perfect for dipping.  The garlic noodles are done al dente, with butter and a lot of garlic, and they're a must for any dinner, no matter what else you order.  If you don't want crab, Helene's Ravioli, delicate rice noodle packets stuffed with shrimp and garlic in a fantastic beurre-blanc sauce, is a great choice.  (I always have the crab puffs, which are creamy and crunchy, in a delicious honey-mustard dip, as an appetizer.)\n\nDrinks can be wonderfully inventive.  If you give the bartender a list of ingredients or just generally describe what you want, he can make it for you.  The chocolate raspberry martini is my favorite, and I've had it with Bailey's, ice cream, Schmidt powdered chocolate, and many other ingredients, depending on my mood.\n\nFor dessert, I usually choose the bread pudding with a glass of Bonny Doon's Vin de Glaciere.\n\nI always ask the wait staff to keep me supplied with hot wet towels and lemon water during the meal and they do.  Shell bowls for the crab are removed and replaced quickly and often.  Our waiter checks frequently to make sure everything is all right and we're OK with drinks and water.\n\nCrustacean is a great place to bring guests to, and the people my husband and I have taken have all enjoyed it immensely.

Parking in the sunset is also a bit easier compared to bustling Polk Street. Overall, I enjoy everything about Thanh Long a little bit more.

The Salmon Carpaccio was drizzled with a olive oil/balsamic vinegar mixture with thin-sliced onions, capers, and greens and was served with pieces of sliced garlic-butter baguette.  The Crab Puffs okay, sort of reminded me of Crab Rangoon and was served with a peanut/mustard sauce which I'm not quite sure complemented the puffs properly.\n\nThe roasted crab and garlic noodles were pretty good, although I wasn't completely blown away.  Maybe it's because I'm Vietnamese and the crab is a pretty standard recipe that most viet families know how to make, with slight variations among different families.  And like the crab, the garlic noodles were good, but this isn't the first time I've had asian-style garlic noodles.  \n\nI had the flourless chocolate cake with amaretto whipped cream which was absolutely delicious!  The cake was warm and soft and along with the amaretto whipped cream made for a sublime flavor experience.  I also tried the creme brulee.  This may sound strange, but it tasted like old houses.  Let me explain.  You know that musty scent when you walk into an antique shop or old house that hasn't been inhabited for years?  That's what the creme brulee tastes like if that smell had a taste.  It's really weird.  My mom and dad appeared to enjoy the fried banana which the restaurant served on the house when they found out it was his birthday, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe decor was nice and the waitstaff was amicable and diligent.  The view wasn't that great...overlooking a couple of thrift stores.  However I did appreciate the option of valet parking since I'm not a huge fan of wasting 30 minutes worth of gas to find parking in SF.\n\nI'd say that one experience here is enough for me since I can, more or less, get this kind of fare at home.

They were accompanied by the famous garlic noodles, which were OK, but I can name at least 2 other places in the Bay Area you should go to that have 100 times better garlic noodles (and that are also way way way less expensive). We also tried the catch of the day, which is cooked in turmeric but didn't taste like anything, and was accompanied by these noodles that literally looked like they were boiled in water and thrown on a plate and had zero taste.\n\nFinally, we tried the ever so famous roasted crab - what a disappointment. It just tasted like normal crab, with some garlic flavor added. Nothing special. And the whole rest of the evening and the next day I just sort of felt sick from the garliciness of it. Certainly not worth $37. And the overall dinner was most definitely not worth the $175ish that we paid for 2 people. I expect much better food for that price.\n\nAlso, the service was pretty crappy. And the chairs are unbelievably uncomfortable. The table was way too small - with all the main courses on our table, we could only each fit an appetizer plate on our table which we had to put on the corner of the table and eat at an uncomfortable angle.\n\nWaste of my time, money and calories.\n\nGo elsewhere.

The terrible service impressed more upon me than the food itself, which albeit was mediocre.\n\n[[BACKGROUND]]\nMy friend had a surprise birthday dinner here and there were 11 of us. Our party made previous reservation and hopped up to the third floor of a dilapidated building. Inside, the restaurant layout was confusing. It seemed to be a weird loop with random stairs and levels and walls around. Luckily, I went to the back of the restaurant and saw my party. \n\n[[SERVICE]]\nForewarned, if you have a large group, 18% gratuity tip is automatically added to your bill. This is normal and expected, but failing service is not. Our server seemed frenzied, unorganized, aloof, and just entirely not there. The other employees were friendly but also seemed overwhelmed at the same time. A few instances, we requested lemon that never came and I requested a regular water cup 3x and that never came either...Seems to be a trend that requests go unanswered. I had to steal my friend's water cup and once in a while, the servers would come around to refill towards the end of our experience.\n\nThey also were missing a crab order and we had to flag them down to bring out another Roasted Crab. When my friend asked for the check, the server told her to just wait cause she had other things to do. I just don't get why doesn't she say \"Ok\" and be on her merry way. What other things do you have to do? Serve?...Apparently not tonight. It was my first time and my friends' first time experiencing such nonchalant, apathetic service at Crustacean and that's an awful shame. \n\n[[FOODS]]\nFood? We ordered the following: Fried Calamari, Papaya Salad with Shrimp, Vietnamese Carpaccio, Seafood Cakes, Roasted Crab, Tamarind Crab, Garlic Noodles, Butterfly Prawns, and a ton of desserts. Notably, the calamari was AMAZING! If you love squid as much as I do,  order it. The seasoning was flavorful with a peppery kick! The breading was also light and crisp, however it came out lukewarm. I suspect they made it a while ago but the server did not bring it out until way later. \n\nThe crabs themselves were okay, mediocre at best. The crab meats were not juicy, moist, or flavorful. It's like they boiled it too long and some of the ends shriveled and browned. Roasted is more savory and umami, and oddly, Tamarind was sweeter and lightly flavored. In my previous experience, tamarind crab is supposed to be salty and savory so I was perplexed by this course. However, the An Garlic Noodles are THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Yasss queen! It was so garlicy, soft, and supple. I could've eaten a whole plate by myself haha. Honestly, the crab was an accompaniment to the great garlic noodles entree for my dinner. \n\nOverall, a sad 3 stars I have to give for the terrible service, mediocre food/preparation, and odd ambiance/location.

I think it says something if a restaurant has made it so long in a town like SF. Who can forget the garlic noodles (buttery, with good chew, and of course, garlicky - so not a first date food, wink wink) and the roasted crab. They do have 2 other types - tamarind and drunken but when I asked our waiter, which crab he said without hesitation, \"It's been 10 years? Yeah, roasted bec/ you'll wish it was if you order something else\". He was right. Was fantastic - finger lickin' good! I mean, I'm dabbing my fingers to catch some more bits of garlic, salt and pepper off the plate. Not good for the blood pressure. Anyway, we also had the following:\n\n- I had the Pear Martini (tasty, not in a big glass so I had to have another beverage)... and the Bellini Martini (also tasty)...\n- my friend had the Lychee martini (very good) and the caipirinha (true to form and I've had them in Rio and it was close)!\n- seafood cakes (comes with 5 and it's like golden fried fish cake)  with pickled beverages\n- grilled calamari with mustard sauce (several small squid grilled with nice char on the outside and nice and tender center) - very good. \n\nToo full for dessert... wish they had mango and sticky rice - my friend said they had it at their sister restaurant Thanh Long. \n\nOverall we were very satisfied and will surely go again someday (and I won't wait so long)!

"], "author": "Wei-Ling W.", "review": "I'm very excited to be blogging about the next restaurant I want to share: Crustacean, in San Francisco. The story of Crustacean is a very unique and heartwarming one, and can be found on their website. It's a win-win situation: my heart is happy to support a restaurant that has such a rich history and happy story of determined women succeeding against all odds, and my tummy is happy to support their food - again, and again, and again!\n\nOn the dollar scale, from fast food to once-in-a-lifetime, I would say Crustacean rates \"special occasion\" - However, since discovering it last year, I've been there three times already and would not hesitate to go again tomorrow. To start, we ordered several appetizers, called \"Small Plates\" and costing around $10.00.\n\nFirst we had the Papaya Salad with Calamari, \"lightly marinated calamari tossed in spicy Vietnamese vinaigrette with green papaya, rau ram and fresh Asian basil.\" I'm not even sure what a natural papaya looks like - such an uncultured foodie - however, I do know that it was amazing, and am now a permanent papaya salad fan and will order it wherever else I see it, just so I can compare them and see who makes it the best!\n\nNext we had the Vietnamese Carpaccio, \"thinly sliced raw beef with a spicy lemon vinaigrette, Asian basil, sliced red onions and roasted peppers.\" My last trip to Crustacean, and the Salmon Carpaccio small plate that I ordered, had made me a carpaccio fan, but something about this dish just wasn't as stunning as the last one I tried. I would definitely re-order the salmon carpaccio next time, or try one of their many other small plates.\n\nCrustacean Shrimp Toast. This was actually really delicious! I was wary about the idea of minced shrimp on bread, but it was executed wonderfully. It was lightly broiled so that it was a tiny bit crunchy and toasty on the outside, but soft on the inside. They only serve three pieces, though, so if you go with a party of six like we did, you must be prepared to share. I would probably try something else next time.\n\nMain Course Time! We ordered everything that Crustacean is famous for: first, the Roasted Dungeoness Crab. This is widely, widely recommended on blogs and review sites everywhere, and for a reason. The crab is perfectly roasted, and so savory that you have to try very hard to refrain from licking the shell! It's easy to crack (and it snaps crisply, not soggy and bendy like cheap crab does), and each bite of the tender meat inside reminds you why Crustacean is one of San Francisco's best seafood restaurants.\n\nSecond, and absolutely crucial for every visit, is the famous An's Garlic Noodles. I knew about these garlic noodles way, way before I ever set foot in Crustacean itself. The first time I had it, I was hooked. Second time I had it, I was still hooked. Third time....yep, still hooked. :) I can't emphasize how much I recommend these garlic noodles. TIP: If you're not feeling spendy enough for a restaurant that's \"special occasion\" priced, though, you can get a very good alternative garlic noodle dish at Unicorn that I heartily recommend. It's lighter, and still very delicious.\n\nDessert! Most of us were tempted into the fried banana and ice cream, which is delicious and a must-have if you've never tried it. However, if you have had it, Crustacean's take on it is not particularly special - but it's not bad at all. But, the best of the night was definitely the Baked Alaska. Now, I am not a big fan of bananas. However, the sauce on the banana slices was divine - sweet without overpowering. I seriously respect any restaurant that can prepare a food I don't particularly like into a dish that I could die for, and this was definitely it!\n\nWith the dessert still on my mind hours later, I looked up Baked Alaska on the interwebs, and I can't say that the description of the dessert sounded like what we ate - so I'll have to order it at the next restaurant that offers it, for the sake of comparison.\n\nYeah...obviously, I am a huge fan of this restaurant and it has not failed to impress me even upon my return trips. I am always recommending this restaurant to friends and/or taking them there personally so I can get another meal in!\n\nFull review with photos here:\nhttp://lorelai.vox.com/library/post/never-disappointed-crustacean-san-francisco.html", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-03-11"}], "steamed seafood dumplings": [{"excerpts": ["We got the Steamed Seafood Dumplings and Calamari to share.

I believe the sauce it comes with on the side that looks like butter is actually like a citrus sauce which gives it an interesting flavor.

This place is as Don King would say, Splendivarous! Yes the dress code is a bit annoying but who cares.

The hosts are a bit stuffy but the servers have for the most part been very cheery and responsive. I have visited this location maybe 10-12 times in the past 2+ years and maybe only one time was the service sub par. \n\nLets just talk about the food here.  If you have something against buttery oily goodness please stop reading now and tend to your rice cakes. The rumors and raves are true, the garlic noodles here is like food from heaven. I haven't tasted better, period. The roasted crab is fantastic! Maybe slightly too salty for some but its not overboard and I'm not someone who loves salty foods. And God-forbid you have to do some work to crack your own food. Have we gotten that lazy as a people? Maybe you'd like someone to chew it for you also? Cracking the crab is part of the whole experience! That leads me to another point. This does get a bit messy so it might not be a good place for a 1st date. \n\nOther dishes that a fantastic are the Royal Tiger Prawns (which includes a side of garlic noodles). I can't comment on further main courses b/c there is ZERO reason to order anything else. Roast Crab, Tiger Prawns, Garlic Noodles. Eat and repeat.

The story of Crustacean is a very unique and heartwarming one, and can be found on their website. It's a win-win situation: my heart is happy to support a restaurant that has such a rich history and happy story of determined women succeeding against all odds, and my tummy is happy to support their food - again, and again, and again!\n\nOn the dollar scale, from fast food to once-in-a-lifetime, I would say Crustacean rates \"special occasion\" - However, since discovering it last year, I've been there three times already and would not hesitate to go again tomorrow. To start, we ordered several appetizers, called \"Small Plates\" and costing around $10.00.\n\nFirst we had the Papaya Salad with Calamari, \"lightly marinated calamari tossed in spicy Vietnamese vinaigrette with green papaya, rau ram and fresh Asian basil.\" I'm not even sure what a natural papaya looks like - such an uncultured foodie - however, I do know that it was amazing, and am now a permanent papaya salad fan and will order it wherever else I see it, just so I can compare them and see who makes it the best!\n\nNext we had the Vietnamese Carpaccio, \"thinly sliced raw beef with a spicy lemon vinaigrette, Asian basil, sliced red onions and roasted peppers.\" My last trip to Crustacean, and the Salmon Carpaccio small plate that I ordered, had made me a carpaccio fan, but something about this dish just wasn't as stunning as the last one I tried. I would definitely re-order the salmon carpaccio next time, or try one of their many other small plates.\n\nCrustacean Shrimp Toast. This was actually really delicious! I was wary about the idea of minced shrimp on bread, but it was executed wonderfully. It was lightly broiled so that it was a tiny bit crunchy and toasty on the outside, but soft on the inside. They only serve three pieces, though, so if you go with a party of six like we did, you must be prepared to share. I would probably try something else next time.\n\nMain Course Time! We ordered everything that Crustacean is famous for: first, the Roasted Dungeoness Crab. This is widely, widely recommended on blogs and review sites everywhere, and for a reason. The crab is perfectly roasted, and so savory that you have to try very hard to refrain from licking the shell! It's easy to crack (and it snaps crisply, not soggy and bendy like cheap crab does), and each bite of the tender meat inside reminds you why Crustacean is one of San Francisco's best seafood restaurants.\n\nSecond, and absolutely crucial for every visit, is the famous An's Garlic Noodles. I knew about these garlic noodles way, way before I ever set foot in Crustacean itself. The first time I had it, I was hooked. Second time I had it, I was still hooked. Third time....yep, still hooked. :) I can't emphasize how much I recommend these garlic noodles. TIP: If you're not feeling spendy enough for a restaurant that's \"special occasion\" priced, though, you can get a very good alternative garlic noodle dish at Unicorn that I heartily recommend. It's lighter, and still very delicious.\n\nDessert! Most of us were tempted into the fried banana and ice cream, which is delicious and a must-have if you've never tried it. However, if you have had it, Crustacean's take on it is not particularly special - but it's not bad at all. But, the best of the night was definitely the Baked Alaska.

The Salmon Carpaccio was drizzled with a olive oil/balsamic vinegar mixture with thin-sliced onions, capers, and greens and was served with pieces of sliced garlic-butter baguette.  The Crab Puffs okay, sort of reminded me of Crab Rangoon and was served with a peanut/mustard sauce which I'm not quite sure complemented the puffs properly.\n\nThe roasted crab and garlic noodles were pretty good, although I wasn't completely blown away.  Maybe it's because I'm Vietnamese and the crab is a pretty standard recipe that most viet families know how to make, with slight variations among different families.  And like the crab, the garlic noodles were good, but this isn't the first time I've had asian-style garlic noodles.  \n\nI had the flourless chocolate cake with amaretto whipped cream which was absolutely delicious!  The cake was warm and soft and along with the amaretto whipped cream made for a sublime flavor experience.  I also tried the creme brulee.  This may sound strange, but it tasted like old houses.  Let me explain.  You know that musty scent when you walk into an antique shop or old house that hasn't been inhabited for years?  That's what the creme brulee tastes like if that smell had a taste.  It's really weird.  My mom and dad appeared to enjoy the fried banana which the restaurant served on the house when they found out it was his birthday, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe decor was nice and the waitstaff was amicable and diligent.  The view wasn't that great...overlooking a couple of thrift stores.  However I did appreciate the option of valet parking since I'm not a huge fan of wasting 30 minutes worth of gas to find parking in SF.\n\nI'd say that one experience here is enough for me since I can, more or less, get this kind of fare at home.

If you read my review of Thanh Long below, that restaurant is in a neighborhood that suffers from periodic Asian gang violence and shootings (not covered by your favorite media of course). \n\nAs far as the more upscale Crustacean restaurant goes, within mere moments you can have easy access to Skank Francisco, aka tenderloin, dirty streets, homeless pestering you for anything, and then some. If you forego valet parking, you might have to drive further down to some really nasty ass places for street metered parking. Hopefully you don't have to pay the homeless guy to \"watch your car for you\" while you eat. \n\nWhen Crustacean first opened, family insisted on coming here instead over Thanh Long numerous times due to more comfortable surroundings, at the time newer settings, and if I remember correctly valet parking which was something you'd never see in Outer Sunset.\nBut all that trouble for paying more, forcing men to put on a collared shirt with pants (no jeans) and in the beginning not clearly stating whether a tie was needed? Doh. I've seen respectable older mofo's come in here with a Hawaiian shirt and shorts, and they are wisked right in without problems, while I flabberghastedly screamed silently upon witnessing this, garbed smart and casually, but not metrosexually.

And the best part? They gave me those two tiny black stirrers that also functioned as straws. Not quite Jimmy Bond Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred (wait isn't that bubble/tapioca milk tea??), but it made me feel like a high roller. I'm glad that I can get the same very well done coffee at Vung Tau in the South or East Bay, for less attitude and money, but if you happen to be here, at least that won't disappoint.

The story of Crustacean is a very unique and heartwarming one, and can be found on their website. It's a win-win situation: my heart is happy to support a restaurant that has such a rich history and happy story of determined women succeeding against all odds, and my tummy is happy to support their food - again, and again, and again!\n\nOn the dollar scale, from fast food to once-in-a-lifetime, I would say Crustacean rates \"special occasion\" - However, since discovering it last year, I've been there three times already and would not hesitate to go again tomorrow. To start, we ordered several appetizers, called \"Small Plates\" and costing around $10.00.\n\nFirst we had the Papaya Salad with Calamari, \"lightly marinated calamari tossed in spicy Vietnamese vinaigrette with green papaya, rau ram and fresh Asian basil.\" I'm not even sure what a natural papaya looks like - such an uncultured foodie - however, I do know that it was amazing, and am now a permanent papaya salad fan and will order it wherever else I see it, just so I can compare them and see who makes it the best!\n\nNext we had the Vietnamese Carpaccio, \"thinly sliced raw beef with a spicy lemon vinaigrette, Asian basil, sliced red onions and roasted peppers.\" My last trip to Crustacean, and the Salmon Carpaccio small plate that I ordered, had made me a carpaccio fan, but something about this dish just wasn't as stunning as the last one I tried. I would definitely re-order the salmon carpaccio next time, or try one of their many other small plates.\n\nCrustacean Shrimp Toast. This was actually really delicious! I was wary about the idea of minced shrimp on bread, but it was executed wonderfully. It was lightly broiled so that it was a tiny bit crunchy and toasty on the outside, but soft on the inside. They only serve three pieces, though, so if you go with a party of six like we did, you must be prepared to share. I would probably try something else next time.\n\nMain Course Time! We ordered everything that Crustacean is famous for: first, the Roasted Dungeoness Crab. This is widely, widely recommended on blogs and review sites everywhere, and for a reason. The crab is perfectly roasted, and so savory that you have to try very hard to refrain from licking the shell! It's easy to crack (and it snaps crisply, not soggy and bendy like cheap crab does), and each bite of the tender meat inside reminds you why Crustacean is one of San Francisco's best seafood restaurants.\n\nSecond, and absolutely crucial for every visit, is the famous An's Garlic Noodles. I knew about these garlic noodles way, way before I ever set foot in Crustacean itself. The first time I had it, I was hooked. Second time I had it, I was still hooked. Third time....yep, still hooked. :) I can't emphasize how much I recommend these garlic noodles. TIP: If you're not feeling spendy enough for a restaurant that's \"special occasion\" priced, though, you can get a very good alternative garlic noodle dish at Unicorn that I heartily recommend. It's lighter, and still very delicious.\n\nDessert! Most of us were tempted into the fried banana and ice cream, which is delicious and a must-have if you've never tried it. However, if you have had it, Crustacean's take on it is not particularly special - but it's not bad at all. But, the best of the night was definitely the Baked Alaska. Now, I am not a big fan of bananas. However, the sauce on the banana slices was divine - sweet without overpowering. I seriously respect any restaurant that can prepare a food I don't particularly like into a dish that I could die for, and this was definitely it!\n\nWith the dessert still on my mind hours later, I looked up Baked Alaska on the interwebs, and I can't say that the description of the dessert sounded like what we ate - so I'll have to order it at the next restaurant that offers it, for the sake of comparison.\n\nYeah...obviously, I am a huge fan of this restaurant and it has not failed to impress me even upon my return trips.

I have no idea why people rave about this Crustacean version to this day--the noodles were mushy and in serious need of any kind of flavor.  I'm a carb/noodle lover, but these hyped up noodles fell far below expectations.  They needed more garlic.  They were very oily (not even buttery, which would have probably made them taste better).  You're better off having garlic noodles at literally any other place in SF--all other places we've tried have been on an entire other level compared to this one (Chubby Noodle, Perilla, or even make your own easily using some fresh noodles from any market in Chinatown).  These must have been good once upon a time, but believe me--they are not anymore.\n\nTip: If you still decide to get the garlic noodles, and similarly find them to be lacking, you can do as I did, and request fish sauce and chili paste--that will make the noodles more edible and definitely more flavorful.\n\nThe place is filthy by the way--the entire experience from the elevator ride up to the lobby area, to the tables, to the utensils and plates.  I'm fine with dirty at a cheap and tasty asian restaurant--but at this price point, that's just unacceptable.  They used to have water features throughout, which have since been turned off (permanently?), and only add to the old/dingy vibe with hard water stains and even visible ceiling leak stains in the lobby.  Others have mentioned that the carpet is gross/smelly--which is also true.\n\nService was solid by the waiters and busboys.  Managers, however, were loudly telling others what to do and moved tables in and out 3 times while we were there, to weirdly try to accommodate parties.  Odd for a place that has a \"dressy\" attire.\n\nAs for attire....not sure why some Yelpers stated that a collar is required--the dress code is casual, with jeans, sweaters, and tennis shoes all around.\n\nIt's easy to get a reservation even calling at 7pm on a Saturday night.

I didn't take off my shirt to reveal a glistening 6-pack like in the movie. Reality is harsher. Luckily for my fat sorry ass I was wearing a crisp white shirt under said offensive hoodie. \n\nI really have no qualms with dress codes at restaurants. I just ask that if you believe yourself to be that type of establishment, then have the balls to strictly enforce it. We would have easily turned away and gone somewhere else instead of being made to feel awkward despite dropping hundreds of dollars on dinner. \n\nWe stumbled in to celebrate 2 birthdays (obviously not knowing there was a dress code ... hey I didn't even Yelp it before hand) and while I was made to take my hoodie off, others were told to keep their jackets on becuase they were wearing t-shirts underneath. It's very arbitrary and if you look around the neighborhood, very misplaced. Crustacean is still stuck in a distorted, 80's view of fine dining. \n\nAlright, dress code rant aside, Crustacean's did surprise me. The decor was nice and the service, attentive. Special props go out to our server who was really cordial and balanced out the occasional look of disdain from the ma\u00eetre d'. \n\nWe started out with several small plates - lobster salad (special for the day), crab puffs, grilled calamari, and the \"famous\" garlic noodles. The crab puffs were the star of the apps. Light and fluffy, we devoured them in an instant. The rest of the apps were decent - fresh seafood and flavorful dipping sauces but nothing you can't find anywhere else. \n\nI had the catch of the day for my entree which was a pan-seared Vietnamese Basa over rice vermicelli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BahDyzswTsdaSa8jnOaK-A?select=xgUxBL08bNgv__mXrcenpg). I was honestly surprised by how flavorful and well balanced the dish was. Other entrees on the table included roast chicken, crab cakes, shaken beef, and the \"signature dish\" - roasted crab.

The BF's dad dropped us off in the street to head up first while he found street parking. We didn't realized there was an elevator and took the stairs up to the third floor. It wasn't a bad walk up and I was pretty mesmerized with the jujitsu going on the second floor.\n\nDon't judge the restaurant by the appearance of the plaza outside. It might look a little shabby but the inside looked pretty upscale. I didn't think there would be as much seating from the outside but it's pretty specious with tables inside. Some tables are located in tight corners and you have to move chairs to get to your seat however. The lighting was a little dim but not to the point where you couldn't see.\n\nI was reassured by the BF's dad to choose whatever I wanted. We basically family styled and picked a whole bunch of dishes. I didn't get a chance to snap any photos since we were eating with his family. We had two calarmari appetizers, lobster and pasta, crab cakes, shaken beef and noodles, and three of the garlic crabs. We didn't realize that most of the entrees would come with the garlic noodies. His mom had put in an extra side order for one beforehand. So if you order the entrees they come with their own side so make sure you read before you put in any extra orders. The crab under the special menu doesn't come with any sides however.\n\nThe calamari was amazing and lobster pasta. I didn't care too much for the crab cakes since I've had better. The crab inside to me didn't taste too fresh. The garlic noodles was pretty delicious but the shaken beef was tender and juicy. Our waitress beforehand had told us she'd save the crabs for last since we'd have to use our hands to eat it. The sad part was by the time the crabs came out I was so stuffed from our entrees. I couldn't enjoy the crab as much as I had wanted. I ate one section of the crabs leg but that was the duration it took everyone else to attack the three crabs. My boyfriend couldn't help but laugh when I told him I had eaten this single section while he had already tackled three sections. \n\nOh, I forgot to mention they really prep you before you eat the crabs. You're provided with plastic bibs, cute tiny forks and claw crackers. Someone is always there to remove dishes you've cleared out and replacing your small plates with new ones. You're left with tons of bowls to put your crab shells as you eat. By the end of the meal you're given a super hotly steamed towel to clean off your hands. \nI can't say it's the best crab I've had since I'm from the south but for California it was pretty darn good. \n\nWe settled for some dessert to share (vanilla bean creme brulee, vanilla mango cheesecake, and flour less chocolate cake with ice cream) which was all delicious besides the cheesecake.  Everyone came out pretty clean besides poor bf's dad. He was stuck doing claw duty for the mom and sister and was splatter with crab meat and juice. His family loved the food and we had lots of fun and laughter the whole time. The host struck conversation with us at the door and asked us how the meal was. My bf's dad had been to Vegas the night before admitted his winnings covered our meal for that evening. As we left the host recommended we come back after his next Vegas trip with winnings.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["The Shaken beef was stir-fried beef with teriyaki sauce, place in a plate surrounded by green beans and a few tomatoes.

And again, even though I had a reservation, they made me wait, albeit only 5 minutes. Even better was when I walked past several empty tables. Anyways, being Vietnamese, I abhor restaurants like these, because 1) my mother cooks better (including Slanted Door), and 2) there's no Vietnamese on the menu. Would you eat in a French restaurant in France if it had no French on the menu? This place is overpriced and Americanized. Crowd was mixed, so at least it doesn't violate the \"judge an Asian restaurant by its Asian patrons\", but I don't think I heard a lick of Vietnamese there. Not that I would, the place is loud, very loud. And of course, the only reason to come here is the crab and or garlic noodles, both of which you can get cheaper and better at plenty of other places. I went for Dine About Town, since Crustacean usually costs $49 a meal. First course is a choice of shrimp and green mango rolls, skewered chicken with asian pickled vegetables, or mixed greens with candied walnuts and orange vinaigrette. After looking at the normal menu, I noticed that the mixed greens were more expensive than the shrimp rolls and the skewered chicken, at $9.50! Rather odd, since when does cheap iceberg lettuce cost more than meat (and chicken at that), much less seafood, in this case, shrimp? So I had the mixed greens, which consisted of iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, red lettuce, and one piece of frisee, as well as the candied walnuts, a few pieces of orange, and orange vinaigrette. It was a sizeable amount, and gave me more bites than my friend's shrimp rolls. It was quite decent, not bad at all really. Second course was a choice of shaken beef (aka bo luc lac aka look luck beef) with jasmine steamed rice or prawn stir fry with An's garlic noodles. I suppose the garlic noodles are what Crustacean is famous for, but i think you get like 5 prawns (not much, even when they're jumbo).

I liked the flavor of the Asian pesto, but the garlic crostini were overbaked and too crunchy for my liking.\n-Crab Puffs (Dungeness Crab Meat Wrapped in Wonton Shell, w/Peanut Mustard, Greens, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#JZtSK84vaRuWQwtMb1SRXA): Good, but there was too much wonton shell.

The sashimi was really fresh, and I liked the ponzu dressing. It was pricey for the portion size, but worth it if you're expensing the dinner.\n-Shaken Beef (Filet Mignon Cubed, Flamb\u00e9ed in Burgundy Wine, Served w/Red Potatoes & Roma Tomatoes, $30, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#0LrAzTcD_PaiF2HQl59gwg): Ok, but again expensive for the portion size.

The raviolis were really good, and you'll like this if you like creamy sauces.

The prawns were a little overcooked so it was difficult to peel off the shells.

The drunken version and tamarind were good/ok, but not as good as the roasted in my opinion.\n-An's Famous Garlic Noodles ($12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#79W6s7DQ9SlIxlzISP2gGQ): Good, although it wasn't as garlicky as I was expecting.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#rdCNn_KdK4h-GCWQS0LXCQ): I can't remember the exact name of this dessert, but it was good.\n-Some Sort of Cake w/Ice Cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#9uWdEO6sFO4Mc1xbs50K3w): I can't really remember this dessert but I think it was pretty good.\n-Baked Alaska w/Bananas Foster (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crustacean-restaurant-san-francisco?select=UYtLkprdp9MYI0pDfhDT_A#Z96HAHYB61CZ3rRzMvLXng): This was interesting since the baked alaska is essentially like an ice cream cake. It was good but not amazing.\n\nI'm still glad I finally got the opportunity to try Crustacean, but am not sure I'll be back due to the high prices and just ok food. Although I enjoyed a good amount of the dishes, there wasn't anything that I would go out of the way to eat again.

Happy Birthday was sung a few times, which gives you an idea of the classiness of the place. Call me a snob if you must, but for a place that claims to enforce a dress code \"in order to ensure a sophisticated experience\" this place attracts a decidedly NOT-upscale crowd. I'll leave it at that. Our table was in a heavily trafficked, very drafty location.\n\nAppetizers: The shrimp toast was tasty, but not as good as what you can get at any hole-in-the-wall dim sum place in Chinatown. The Vietnamese beef carpaccio was pretty flavorless. May I suggest the chef makes a quick trip to Yummy Yummy on Irving Street for an education. The secret is in the temperature of the meat and the amount of lemon juice.\n\nWine: For around $50 a nice Alsace Sylvaner. No complaints there except it arrived after our appetizers and was too warm. So I guess I do have complaints.\n\nEntree: The house specialties, the roast crab and garlic noodles. Both were fine and obviously the reason the place is relatively popular. Still, for $40 you get a pretty spectacular crab at most places and this was just good but not spectacular.\n\nDesserts: Bread pudding was great, the baked Alaska was served far too cold, but overall the dessert experience was passable for a bill worth half the amount.\n\nService: I already mentioned the poor timing of the wine service (which was repeated for the espresso) and overall the server was inattentive.

Certainly the one staff person I chanced to run into on my way up the stairs confirmed the Secret Kitchen protocol did in fact exist.\n\nFirst impressions of the place were good. The ma\u00eetre d' gave polished, professional service and was patient with noob questions. The restaurant is elevated over the street, giving you views of the city. The dining area is also tiered, so even if you are not sitting at a window, there's still the possibility of good views. The dim room of dark colours offered a nice retreat from the bright sun outside if you are dining early in the evening.\n\nMy reservation was for 5:30 PM and one of the first ones in the restaurant that Sunday evening. They are apparently supremely busy come sundown (the timing of which is therefore influenced by Daylight Savings Time adjustments). That, and if there is a convention in town.\n\nThe basic Roast Crab is one of the restaurant's original (and now Secret Kitchen) recipes; the Tamarind Crab and Drunken Crabs were added later. The \"extra time\" required for the crustacean recipes from the Secret Kitchen was estimated by the server to be just about 15 minutes more, though one should expect it to be even longer once the restaurant gets busy later in the evening starting around 7 PM.\n\nAs is my wont, I arrived early. The restaurant was basically empty. The protocol apparently was that I could wait seated at the bar, or I could wait in the lobby; either way, they would seat me once 2-3 persons had arrived. (Why?) Anyway, I complied, though eventually they did seat me alone. Of course during this time I did not idle, but perused the menu.\n\nOnce at the table, I started with a drink. They had non-alcoholic ginger beer. It was disaster (how can a restaurant mess up a bottled drink?). Once my friends arrived and our first appetizer orders showed up, they still hadn't redeemed themselves from this FAIL:\n\nGinger Beer ($6)\n- Tasted weak. The reason is probably because at least 2/3rds of my glass was ice cubes. I paid $4 for ice and $2 for maybe a 1/3rd of a glass of ginger beer that didn't taste anywhere as good as the four-pack I bought from Trader Joe's that cost less than $6.\n- Crustacean is a \"fancy restaurant\" and a popular one. I get that. I've eaten at even more posh or pretentious restaurants in Vancouver. But this much ice is disgusting for a $6 drink.\n\nMore detailed reviews of the 10 things we tried can't fit in the 5000 character limit here, but I've blogged it at http://lower-mainland-bc.blogspot.ca/2015/04/hit-and-miss-at-crustacean-restaurant.html  For the moment I'll just mention the Roast Crab:\n\nRoast Crab (\"quoted price\", for us it was $48.95)\n- Looked like a baked crab sitting in a pool of oil sprinkled liberally with pepper.\nI thought maybe the flavour here was in the oil (roasted with the crab?). I mixed some of the garlic noodles in that oil. Nope. Now my garlic noodles just tasted oily.\nAfter cracking open the leathery shell, the crab meat tasted like crab.\n- I even licked the shell for any flavour that might be crusted on (e.g., in the matter you would definitely lollipop the shell of a Singapore Style Chili Crab https://youtu.be/jrUpFdS74LI?t=8m16s ). Nope, no flavour to be savoured here.\n- Total waste of time (and money). Just get a crab from the market and steam it yourself and use whatever condiments you like.\n\nDespite a really lousy start with the $6 for ice with a splash of ginger beer plus a couple of dish duds, Crustacean would still get a passing score because:\n-Prices for many items are actually good. A great way to get a filling meal at a reasonable price is to share fried rice ($8) or garlic noodles ($10.95) and a main with a friend -- i.e., treat Crustacean like any other family style / for sharing Chinese restaurant and go with several people.\n- Items are hit and miss, but there are good items on the menu. Do not just go with the hype and order Secret Kitchen stuff.\n\nHowever, BEFORE the end of the meal -- BEFORE we had even finished dessert -- I got the bill. WTH? Sorry, points off for that. Including the debacle with the Ginger Beer, I am tempted to just give them 1 star.", "rating": 2, "date": "2015-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["First of all, we SHOULD have ordered the roast crab (even though very pricey) because after we ate our mediocre meal the guy next to us was going to town on his plate ", "and I've never seen a happier man!

The spice used for the Roast Crab consisted of garlic, butter, salt and pepper--nothing very tasty, but again, the crab is well-cooked.  Shaken Beef ($27) is also good, however it probably is not for everyone--it is cubed in the stir-fry of green beans and onions, and on the sweet side, similar to (but not as good as) Asian beef jerky--I like sweet, so I thought it was decent.  The Shaken Beef dish also came with 3 raw cherry tomatoes for color...odd plating since they could have easily put a few slices of orange or red bell pepper in the stir-fry instead.  The food also comes out very quickly, which was nice.\n\nPASS on the garlic noodles ($10.95).  I have no idea why people rave about this Crustacean version to this day--the noodles were mushy and in serious need of any kind of flavor.  I'm a carb/noodle lover, but these hyped up noodles fell far below expectations.  They needed more garlic.  They were very oily (not even buttery, which would have probably made them taste better).  You're better off having garlic noodles at literally any other place in SF--all other places we've tried have been on an entire other level compared to this one (Chubby Noodle, Perilla, or even make your own easily using some fresh noodles from any market in Chinatown).  These must have been good once upon a time, but believe me--they are not anymore.\n\nTip: If you still decide to get the garlic noodles, and similarly find them to be lacking, you can do as I did, and request fish sauce and chili paste--that will make the noodles more edible and definitely more flavorful.\n\nThe place is filthy by the way--the entire experience from the elevator ride up to the lobby area, to the tables, to the utensils and plates.  I'm fine with dirty at a cheap and tasty asian restaurant--but at this price point, that's just unacceptable.  They used to have water features throughout, which have since been turned off (permanently?), and only add to the old/dingy vibe with hard water stains and even visible ceiling leak stains in the lobby.  Others have mentioned that the carpet is gross/smelly--which is also true.\n\nService was solid by the waiters and busboys.  Managers, however, were loudly telling others what to do and moved tables in and out 3 times while we were there, to weirdly try to accommodate parties.  Odd for a place that has a \"dressy\" attire.\n\nAs for attire....not sure why some Yelpers stated that a collar is required--the dress code is casual, with jeans, sweaters, and tennis shoes all around.\n\nIt's easy to get a reservation even calling at 7pm on a Saturday night.

It is kind of far from Bart which makes it harder for people like me who were college students to get there - Really you need to take a cab or Uber if coming from Bart - the cab ride was about $11 each way. The walk is long quite long and up and down big hills. The other reason is because of the buildings around it. They don't have much eye appeal.

One anniversary the wife and I shelled out $700 here. Yes, we sure did. It only takes a couple good bottles to get there. When we go, we normally order a crab a piece and garlic noodles each. We also share one other entree as our appetizer. Then we share the baked Alaska. It's a lot of food and the bill normally comes to about $180 or so with a drink or two. Crab is always market price but hovers around $35 - $48 each. \n\nTo me this has become a part of SF and is definitely a spot to go and check out at least once. C'mon would I lead you astray? I think not. I know my one positive vibe can't over power some of the negatives here but seriously I think the negative knocks were not in it for the right things.

I was looking forward to having a great crab lunch with my family, with piping hot shrimp toast, calamari, and garlic noodles. Instead we got a lot of disappointment.

They are truly the best at what they do, and cannot be imitated (trust me, I've tried MANY times). \n\nI'm NOT a fan of the dark atmosphere, the long walk up the stairs in your heels, the horrible parking, or the expensive valet service. You have NO choice when it comes to these things.\n\nBut I guess you pay for the ambiance, which is a dimly-lit upscale version of Thanh Long. When I went to Crustaceans for my 7 year wedding anniversary, I had just gotten my lasik surgery that day and didn't realize until we had arrived at the restaurant, that there was a big fat sign describing the dress code (I could barely see- my new eyes covered by those dorky optomestrist glasses, I had no time to google or yelp before going). Luckily, my husband was dressed in a nice sweater vest/khaki's, while I stood behind him hiding in my black sleeveless shirt, black velour pants, and black sneakers. Anyone in their right mind could've seen I was underdressed, but it was dark and I dont think they really checked me (obviously). I got lucky, I definitely would not try that ever again. \n\nAnyhow.. although it's the same recipe as Thanh Long, it tastes 2nd rate to me. On the regular, I definitely choose Thanh Long in terms of quality, location, and I prefer their kick-back ambiance. I would only go to Crustacean's if I were on a date, for that super-snotty dimly-lit \"fine dining\" ambiance that you want to impress your date with. But even then, would you really look forward to a 2nd date if you came out of your 1st date smellling like garlic and covered in crab shells?\n\nDon't worry, I still love you Crustaceans... but overall, I dont love you as much as I love your sister restaurant Thanh Long.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-08-18"}, {"excerpts": ["If you're still bent on eating here, stick with the Roast Crab, the Tamarind Crab is surprisingly bland and the messiest dish to eat in the house.

It's not that good, but I guess people haven't been to a real Vietnamese restaurant for comparison.\n\nTheir famous crab is a three pound monster that tastes pretty good for being frozen, but is not worth the $36 -- the menu says seasonal prices, and being crab season, it should have cost half that.\n\nThe recipe is painfully simple: boil, then roast the crab. Scoop out the guts, because Americans don't like that stuff. Then before serving, smother in garlic butter and season with salt and pepper. (For their $10 specialty noodles, just buy cheap chow mein noodles, and then soak them in garlic salt and butter.)\n\nEating the crab is a total mess, as the shell is too soft in comparison to how it's prepared in authentic Vietnamese or Chinese restaurants, where the shell is crunchy enough that you could get by without using a shell cracker. On a crab this big, the meat is abundant, but bland. A smaller crab would be more flavorful. Also, by the time you get to the second half of the crab, the butter has already started congealing on your plate... not very appealing.\n\nEating in the restaurant, it's noticeably cold. For a place where dinner and drinks can easily run $60-$80 a person, one would think the An family could afford carpeting and a heater.\n\nThe biggest gripe: after eating a sloppy crab meal and your hands are covered in crab guts and butter, they hand you a small wet towel and expect that it is enough. So you go to the bathroom to wash your hands, only to find that they have no hot water! Even McDonalds with their $2 Filet-O-Fish can afford hot water, but apparently Crustaceans cannot. Maybe they should charge $40 a crab and hire a plumber to put in a hot water faucet.\n\nThe food is decent, but not worth it at the price. If you're still bent on eating here, stick with the Roast Crab, the Tamarind Crab is surprisingly bland and the messiest dish to eat in the house.

Being Vietnamese, I was even mooore excited because it was a Vietnamese restaurant. Unfortunately, my excitement was quickly dispelled.\n\nFirst of all, they have a dress code. Me and my group didn't know this and one of the girls had a zip up hoodie on. They were unnecessarily rude about their dress code, but they still let us in as long as the hoodie came off. Interesting though, their dress code said that they would provide a white collared shirt to any customers if necessary. I wonder if that ever happens...\n\nThe ambience of the place is ok, despite them trying to make the place super posh. Nothing that blew me away. It's def nicer than your average Vietnamese place, but I don't think as nice as some other Vietnamese fusion restaurants. The service was pretty attentive. \n\nNow, on to the food. The Dine About Town menu really wasn't all that great. It had spring rolls and chicken skewers as the appetizer...which honestly can be done a lot better AND a lot cheaper at your typical hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese place. Their main course options (again, for Dine About Town) were shrimp on garlic noodles and shaking beef (I think that's what it's called in English -- bo luc lac). We went for the shrimp with garlic noodles. Mm...the garlic noodles were tasty, as were the shrimp, but there were just a handful of shrimp, which was kind of disappointing. And as an entree...ehhh it got old pretty fast. Good thing we also got some of their famous crab too (instead of all of us doing Dine About Town)! We got the tamarind crab and the roast crab. The tamarind crab was pretty good but...there was just something off about the sauce. If you've never had tamarind flavored seafood before at other Vietnamese restaurants, you probably wouldn't notice...but us as three Vietnamese kids, it just wasn't quite right. The roast crab was super salty and super oily. I was really excited though because I LOVE the inside of the crab head. I love it so much that the waiter even brought us two more complimentary heads!

Pretty standard, pretty good, but again...I could've gotten 5 times as many bananas for half the price elsewhere...\n\nOverall, if you come, come for the crab and be prepared to spend more than you should.

I am still lost in the wonderful taste bud challenging garlic and pepper flavour of the Roast crab and the garlic noodles!  Even the tamarind sauce with crab are good but I am so partial to the roast crab I think I could possibly finish the whole thing all by myself.... just give me ample time!  I give 4 stars because I found the yummy garlic noodles has too much MSG than my body would like it and I was left thirsty the whole night having to drink lots of water.

We were sorely disappointed.  The first red flag was how quickly the food came out.  All of the dishes we ordered (including the roasted crab that was noted on the menu that it \"may take longer to prepare\") were on our table in five minutes after placing the order.  Literally.  My husband ordered, went to the bathroom (to do a number one), and came back to find food on the table (!!!).  We were all surprised, but decided to give the food a try.  Here's a rundown:\n\n1. The crispy fried rice paper rolls were pretty good.  The outside crispy part had a nice texture and made the overall roll unique compared to the typical imperial spring roll you order at Vietnamese pho restaurants.  \n2. The roast crab was fine, but didn't taste like it was cooked-to-order.  \n3. The calamari special was good, but the order was small and there weren't nearly enough tentacles (tentacles are so much more tasty and interesting to eat).  \n4.

The overall service was passable, but felt forced, artificial and aloof.  Finally, the cost is very high for the meal and experience.  We didn't even stay for dessert because we were so disappointed.

My overall impression of this place is that its like a P.F. Chang's of crab and garlic noodles. By that, I mean the food is decent quality, but not decent enough quality to justify the prices. Also, there are other places where you can get similar things for much cheaper - I list them at the end of this review. This might be a good date place to take a date if you don't mind garlic breath from the noodles, wearing a bib, and getting crab juice all over your pants.

As far as the crab, I'd recommend the drunken crab over the roasted crab. The drunken crab was more flavorful. The crab was good, but I was also expecting phenomenal here. For a steamed crab, it was decent though. \n\nI would recommend the seafood salad, though for the price, I felt like they could have loaded up on the seafood a little more. The vegetable to seafood ratio wasn't great. The shaking beef was very good, I'd definitely recommend that dish - the beef was really tender and flavorful. And finally, the vegetable and tofu dish we got (I can't remember what it was called) was also good, but the price on this dish was also a little steep for what it was. This place must have an insane profit margin. \n\nIf you want good garlic noodles at a much cheaper price, check out Ben Tre in the Bay Area. You get a huge portion (with protein) for a much better price - I'm talking less than $20. Also, for better crab (but unhealthier cause it's deep fried), go to R&G lounge.

Overall, the crab meat was very juicy and it was steamed well, but it wasn't perfect. I did love hearing that the crabs were in the water that morning, and on my plate hours later! Definite 5 stars was the service. The waiters are impeccable with replacing the shell bowl and clearing napkins as you eat. You never feel messy!

Covered with lots of garlic, salt and pepper, the crab was cooked to perfection!  There was a mysterious flavor that the crab had that made it extra tasty, so my boyfriend asked the waiter:\n\n\"Is there any MSG in this?\"\n\nWaiter: \"Nothing thats not naturally occurring.\"\n\nWikipedia defines MSG as: Monosodium glutamate, also known as sodium glutamate or MSG, is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, one of the most abundant naturally occurring non-essential amino acids.\n\nWow, way to fool the uneducated!\n\nDrunken Garlic Crab:\nCooked in three different wines, it tasted exactly how it was described.  Nothing special to this dish.\n\nGarlic Noodles:\nNoodles were sweet tasting and was just needed to balance out the meal filled with lots of crab.\n\nThe portions of each crab were big but my boyfriend and I were able to finish a crab on our own.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic with dim lighting. We got seated and ordered a Riesling wine to start. We ordered the two special appetizers, a lobster salad and the salt and pepper calamari. The lobster in the salad was delicious and the dressing that went on top went perfectly with the mango in the salad and added a nice light touch that tied in all the ingredients of the salad. The calamari wasn't greasy and was nice and crispy with the perfect amount of breading so that the taste of the seafood wasn't overwhelmed. There was also a nice dipping sauce on the side. We ordered the famous roast crab, the drunken crab, garlic noodles, garlic rice, tiger prawns and the tamarind crab to share amongst us.

Crustacean, pretty good foods, great variety...but minus the expected attentive excellent service. The terrible service impressed more upon me than the food itself, which albeit was mediocre.\n\n[[BACKGROUND]]\nMy friend had a surprise birthday dinner here and there were 11 of us. Our party made previous reservation and hopped up to the third floor of a dilapidated building. Inside, the restaurant layout was confusing. It seemed to be a weird loop with random stairs and levels and walls around. Luckily, I went to the back of the restaurant and saw my party. \n\n[[SERVICE]]\nForewarned, if you have a large group, 18% gratuity tip is automatically added to your bill. This is normal and expected, but failing service is not. Our server seemed frenzied, unorganized, aloof, and just entirely not there. The other employees were friendly but also seemed overwhelmed at the same time. A few instances, we requested lemon that never came and I requested a regular water cup 3x and that never came either...Seems to be a trend that requests go unanswered. I had to steal my friend's water cup and once in a while, the servers would come around to refill towards the end of our experience.\n\nThey also were missing a crab order and we had to flag them down to bring out another Roasted Crab. When my friend asked for the check, the server told her to just wait cause she had other things to do. I just don't get why doesn't she say \"Ok\" and be on her merry way. What other things do you have to do? Serve?...Apparently not tonight. It was my first time and my friends' first time experiencing such nonchalant, apathetic service at Crustacean and that's an awful shame. \n\n[[FOODS]]\nFood? We ordered the following: Fried Calamari, Papaya Salad with Shrimp, Vietnamese Carpaccio, Seafood Cakes, Roasted Crab, Tamarind Crab, Garlic Noodles, Butterfly Prawns, and a ton of desserts. Notably, the calamari was AMAZING! If you love squid as much as I do,  order it. The seasoning was flavorful with a peppery kick! The breading was also light and crisp, however it came out lukewarm. I suspect they made it a while ago but the server did not bring it out until way later. \n\nThe crabs themselves were okay, mediocre at best. The crab meats were not juicy, moist, or flavorful. It's like they boiled it too long and some of the ends shriveled and browned. Roasted is more savory and umami, and oddly, Tamarind was sweeter and lightly flavored. In my previous experience, tamarind crab is supposed to be salty and savory so I was perplexed by this course. However, the An Garlic Noodles are THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Yasss queen! It was so garlicy, soft, and supple. I could've eaten a whole plate by myself haha. Honestly, the crab was an accompaniment to the great garlic noodles entree for my dinner. \n\nOverall, a sad 3 stars I have to give for the terrible service, mediocre food/preparation, and odd ambiance/location. I'm sure they've had better days but today was just not it.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-08-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The basic Roast Crab is one of the restaurant's original (and now Secret Kitchen) recipes; the Tamarind Crab and Drunken Crabs were added later. "], "author": "Simon S.", "review": "Crustacean was one of the restaurants recommended to me for my 2015-April trip to San Francisco by friends who used to live in San Francisco. I'm always up for interesting eats, so the mystique of their having a \"Secret Kitchen\" where family recipes are prepared away from the prying eyes of \"outsider\" staff intrigued me. That, plus people raving about their garlic noodles. And Crustacean sounded like such an old family restaurant that I didn't think it merely a marketing gimmick. Certainly the one staff person I chanced to run into on my way up the stairs confirmed the Secret Kitchen protocol did in fact exist.\n\nFirst impressions of the place were good. The ma\u00eetre d' gave polished, professional service and was patient with noob questions. The restaurant is elevated over the street, giving you views of the city. The dining area is also tiered, so even if you are not sitting at a window, there's still the possibility of good views. The dim room of dark colours offered a nice retreat from the bright sun outside if you are dining early in the evening.\n\nMy reservation was for 5:30 PM and one of the first ones in the restaurant that Sunday evening. They are apparently supremely busy come sundown (the timing of which is therefore influenced by Daylight Savings Time adjustments). That, and if there is a convention in town.\n\nThe basic Roast Crab is one of the restaurant's original (and now Secret Kitchen) recipes; the Tamarind Crab and Drunken Crabs were added later. The \"extra time\" required for the crustacean recipes from the Secret Kitchen was estimated by the server to be just about 15 minutes more, though one should expect it to be even longer once the restaurant gets busy later in the evening starting around 7 PM.\n\nAs is my wont, I arrived early. The restaurant was basically empty. The protocol apparently was that I could wait seated at the bar, or I could wait in the lobby; either way, they would seat me once 2-3 persons had arrived. (Why?) Anyway, I complied, though eventually they did seat me alone. Of course during this time I did not idle, but perused the menu.\n\nOnce at the table, I started with a drink. They had non-alcoholic ginger beer. It was disaster (how can a restaurant mess up a bottled drink?). Once my friends arrived and our first appetizer orders showed up, they still hadn't redeemed themselves from this FAIL:\n\nGinger Beer ($6)\n- Tasted weak. The reason is probably because at least 2/3rds of my glass was ice cubes. I paid $4 for ice and $2 for maybe a 1/3rd of a glass of ginger beer that didn't taste anywhere as good as the four-pack I bought from Trader Joe's that cost less than $6.\n- Crustacean is a \"fancy restaurant\" and a popular one. I get that. I've eaten at even more posh or pretentious restaurants in Vancouver. But this much ice is disgusting for a $6 drink.\n\nMore detailed reviews of the 10 things we tried can't fit in the 5000 character limit here, but I've blogged it at http://lower-mainland-bc.blogspot.ca/2015/04/hit-and-miss-at-crustacean-restaurant.html  For the moment I'll just mention the Roast Crab:\n\nRoast Crab (\"quoted price\", for us it was $48.95)\n- Looked like a baked crab sitting in a pool of oil sprinkled liberally with pepper.\nI thought maybe the flavour here was in the oil (roasted with the crab?). I mixed some of the garlic noodles in that oil. Nope. Now my garlic noodles just tasted oily.\nAfter cracking open the leathery shell, the crab meat tasted like crab.\n- I even licked the shell for any flavour that might be crusted on (e.g., in the matter you would definitely lollipop the shell of a Singapore Style Chili Crab https://youtu.be/jrUpFdS74LI?t=8m16s ). Nope, no flavour to be savoured here.\n- Total waste of time (and money). Just get a crab from the market and steam it yourself and use whatever condiments you like.\n\nDespite a really lousy start with the $6 for ice with a splash of ginger beer plus a couple of dish duds, Crustacean would still get a passing score because:\n-Prices for many items are actually good. A great way to get a filling meal at a reasonable price is to share fried rice ($8) or garlic noodles ($10.95) and a main with a friend -- i.e., treat Crustacean like any other family style / for sharing Chinese restaurant and go with several people.\n- Items are hit and miss, but there are good items on the menu. Do not just go with the hype and order Secret Kitchen stuff.\n\nHowever, BEFORE the end of the meal -- BEFORE we had even finished dessert -- I got the bill. WTH? Sorry, points off for that.

I've always wanted to experience San Francisco food scene. Typical tourist traps like Fishermans Wharf was on my list of places to go to get some of that bay area seafood.

It's not that good, but I guess people haven't been to a real Vietnamese restaurant for comparison.\n\nTheir famous crab is a three pound monster that tastes pretty good for being frozen, but is not worth the $36 -- the menu says seasonal prices, and being crab season, it should have cost half that.\n\nThe recipe is painfully simple: boil, then roast the crab. Scoop out the guts, because Americans don't like that stuff. Then before serving, smother in garlic butter and season with salt and pepper. (For their $10 specialty noodles, just buy cheap chow mein noodles, and then soak them in garlic salt and butter.)\n\nEating the crab is a total mess, as the shell is too soft in comparison to how it's prepared in authentic Vietnamese or Chinese restaurants, where the shell is crunchy enough that you could get by without using a shell cracker. On a crab this big, the meat is abundant, but bland. A smaller crab would be more flavorful. Also, by the time you get to the second half of the crab, the butter has already started congealing on your plate... not very appealing.\n\nEating in the restaurant, it's noticeably cold. For a place where dinner and drinks can easily run $60-$80 a person, one would think the An family could afford carpeting and a heater.\n\nThe biggest gripe: after eating a sloppy crab meal and your hands are covered in crab guts and butter, they hand you a small wet towel and expect that it is enough. So you go to the bathroom to wash your hands, only to find that they have no hot water! Even McDonalds with their $2 Filet-O-Fish can afford hot water, but apparently Crustaceans cannot. Maybe they should charge $40 a crab and hire a plumber to put in a hot water faucet.\n\nThe food is decent, but not worth it at the price. If you're still bent on eating here, stick with the Roast Crab, the Tamarind Crab is surprisingly bland and the messiest dish to eat in the house.

The Dine About Town menu really wasn't all that great. It had spring rolls and chicken skewers as the appetizer...which honestly can be done a lot better AND a lot cheaper at your typical hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese place. Their main course options (again, for Dine About Town) were shrimp on garlic noodles and shaking beef (I think that's what it's called in English -- bo luc lac).

And again, even though I had a reservation, they made me wait, albeit only 5 minutes. Even better was when I walked past several empty tables. Anyways, being Vietnamese, I abhor restaurants like these, because 1) my mother cooks better (including Slanted Door), and 2) there's no Vietnamese on the menu. Would you eat in a French restaurant in France if it had no French on the menu? This place is overpriced and Americanized. Crowd was mixed, so at least it doesn't violate the \"judge an Asian restaurant by its Asian patrons\", but I don't think I heard a lick of Vietnamese there. Not that I would, the place is loud, very loud. And of course, the only reason to come here is the crab and or garlic noodles, both of which you can get cheaper and better at plenty of other places. I went for Dine About Town, since Crustacean usually costs $49 a meal. First course is a choice of shrimp and green mango rolls, skewered chicken with asian pickled vegetables, or mixed greens with candied walnuts and orange vinaigrette. After looking at the normal menu, I noticed that the mixed greens were more expensive than the shrimp rolls and the skewered chicken, at $9.50! Rather odd, since when does cheap iceberg lettuce cost more than meat (and chicken at that), much less seafood, in this case, shrimp? So I had the mixed greens, which consisted of iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, red lettuce, and one piece of frisee, as well as the candied walnuts, a few pieces of orange, and orange vinaigrette. It was a sizeable amount, and gave me more bites than my friend's shrimp rolls. It was quite decent, not bad at all really. Second course was a choice of shaken beef (aka bo luc lac aka look luck beef) with jasmine steamed rice or prawn stir fry with An's garlic noodles. I suppose the garlic noodles are what Crustacean is famous for, but i think you get like 5 prawns (not much, even when they're jumbo). And one of my favorite Viet dishes that I always order is bo luc lac (along with ca kho tho and the sour [because of the pineapple chunks] catfish soup), so I got the shaken beef.
