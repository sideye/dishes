This has now become my 2nd favorite ice cream place in SF behind Bi-Rite.\n\nLocated on an unassuming street corner in the Dogpatch (across the street from Serpentine & Hard Knox), Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous is worth a drive or bus ride out to the area. My friends and I got here around 2-3pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were only a couple people in line. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I naturally had to sample multiple flavors. Here are the ones we ended up getting and sampling:\n\n*Salted Mango (5 stars - junior cup for $2.75): SO GOOD. This was the flavor I got, and every bite was DELICIOUS. The ice cream was not salty, but the salted nature did a great job of complementing the sweet mango flavor so that every bite had the perfect amount of sweetness.\n\n*Birthday Cake (bf gave this 5 stars): Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cake and sprinkles? Who can resist! I tried some of this and thought it was super tasty. And the bf was in love with this.\n\n*Bananas Foster (friend had this): My friend really enjoyed this. If you're a banana fan, you'll love this because it's a great banana ice cream with additional butter/brown sugar/cinnamon in it to give it a nice, sweet kick.\n\n*Dark & Stormy (sampled this): Say what?? YES, this is actually ice cream that tastes like the alcoholic dark & stormy. Not sure if I'd order a whole cup of this on my own, but it was quite tasty and it sure tasted like the drink!\n\n*Chocolate Chip Cookie (3 stars): This was an actual cookie, not an ice cream. This was the only thing that I wasn't crazy about. I liked that the chocolate chunks were evenly spread throughout the cookie, but overall the cookie was too buttery for me.\n\nI will definitely be back very soon because I loved the ice cream I ate, and there's so much more to try!

To give the benefit of the doubt, maybe it's all diffused in the heights of the tall warehouse ceiling, or perhaps it is masked by the baking smell.  I was disappointed when I realized that what I thought were samples were really just small pastries for sale.  All the baked goods do look delicious if you somehow have space in your stomach for ice cream AND brittles/cookies.  \n\n[THE CREAMERY]\n\nYelp tells me of wondrous ice cream flavors, but on any day they only serve 8 choices.  (I guess there are only 8 Wonders of the world.)  I guess that decreases the utility for Yelp review such as this one, but before you stop reading, you may want to look at my suggested procedure:\n\n1. Decide what looks good on the menu while in line \n2. Sample 2 of the richer flavors you want to try (so you can try it without getting too full from entire scoops.  As a general rule of thumb, I usually sample anything with caramel because it tastes best in small sample sizes)\n3. Get a double scoop of the lighter flavors you want to try (no need to waste samples; if it sounds good, chances are it is good)\n4. Eat the top scoop quickly so you don't look like a fatty that got a double scoop\n\n[THE FLAVORS]\n\nThe flavors are indeed quite Miscellaneous and playful.  \n\n(+) The JASMINE GREEN TEA is understandably popular, and I would imagine it to be particularly so in tea fanatics who are secretly craving boba and find themselves at a pricey ice cream parlor instead.  I know saying this goes against my people, but I find the jasmine green tea ice cream to be the epiphany in the latest trend towards creamas/milk foams/sea salt things--a perfected remake of the jasmine milk tea.  The tea flavor is so good that it tastes more like tea than the actual milk tea of those dismal powder-powered chain boba shops (i.e. Lollicup, TapEx, Quickly's).  \n\n(+) The PISTACHIO MASCARPONE (the two go surprisingly well together) and FLAN (description included something with caramel) are tasty, though these belong in the sampling category because they are so rich I'd probably feel sick after whole scoops.  \n\n(+/-) The VANILLA BEAN is as boring as it sounds; instead I suggest the CHOCOLATE CHIP which is vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips.  \n\n(-) The alcoholic ones are not alcoholic enough.  I've tried the LEMON CAMPARI (which has delightfully strong lemon of kid-made lemonade) as well as the KAHLUA CREAM (which had a strong coffee flavor that could have been mistaken for Vietnamese iced coffee in a blind taste test), but neither were very alcoholic.  (Or maybe the City just makes strong drinks so now alcoholic ice cream is weak in comparison)\n\n(-) My friend got the GRASSHOPPER, which is a hipster name for mint chocolate chip.  Anecdotally in our case study with n=1, we report that the grasshopper seemed to melt faster because we both ate our ice cream at the same spot at similar rates, only the grasshopper melted way faster and it got all over her hand and got blown into her clothes.  \n\n[THE CONES]\n\nI was excited to try the HOUSEMADE SUGAR CONE because I was unimpressed with Bi-Rite's generic cones and I horribly miss the artisan-swirl-chocolate-filled cones from Ici's in Berkeley.  I had high hopes in my extra $1, but the ROI was not great because there wasn't much unique about the cone except that it got uniquely soggy.  I'm sure it would be quite good on its own, but like the low-melting-point grasshopper, they need to do a bit of materials engineering work.\n\nSurprisingly, the REGULAR CONE was better than the specialty housemade sugar cone because it did not get soggy, plus it does not cost extra. More $ saved means more scoops P:\n\n[MISCELLANEOUS TIPS]\n\n- Prices are exact change!!!  No fumbling with an awkward handful of coins while simultaneously juggling a melting ice cream cone and having no hands to take a picture.\n- $3.50 half scoop, $4 single scoop, $6 double scoop, $8 triple scoop... expensive, but worth it once in awhile, especially if you still have a lot of flavors to be tried.\n- Creaminess is average, meaning you can probably finish a double scoop if you had lunch awhile ago and you go with my strategy of sampling rich flavors and getting lighter ones.\n- Parking in the immediate area is annoying, but if you go further into the residential area it is not impossible.\n- There is a decent amount of seating with 2 large communal tables and a small side table.  It gets busy on weekends, but people usually leave after they finish their ice cream (quite fast because it's so tasty)", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Also tried bites of my friend's caramel with sea salt, thai tea, and maple black pepper.

I'm going to take care of that now.\n\nI often use my lactose intolerance as an excuse to limit my intake on dairy, but on specific Tuesdays and Wednesdays each month that whole \"I can't have too much dairy\"-thing goes right out of the window.  I generally stop off at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous prior to volunteering at the San Francisco Food Bank located just four blocks away.  Often the reasoning is two-fold.  Why arrive too early inside a massive warehouse waiting for other volunteers to arrive when I could kill time inside a fabulous ice cream shop and have some fabulous ice cream to boot?  If I crunch enough enzyme tablets prior to my visits my lactose excuse simply disintegrates.\n\nI not only love the ice cream here, but everything I've tried has been magnificent whether that be the peanut or almond brittle, the malted milk balls or the crazy Peanut Brittle and Toffee Cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=9uxO9bcwXSjZ5qgjsrQTOg).  I normally like crunchy cookies over soft cookies, but these stand nicely in between with crispy edges and a soft, chewy center of buttery cookie with fabulous peanut brittle and soft toffee melted in.\n\nI've easily tried over twenty of their often-changing ice cream flavors, and over the months I have found a few favorites.  Their Nougat ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=InskBR3E7c-vh42WbKEaeA) was the first flavor I had ever tried.  If ever I experienced love at first bite this was it.  It's basically sweet cream from Marin's favorite Straus Family Dairy with organic pistachios and bits of dried fruit like cherries and apricots. The description is pretty simple, but the flavor was so intense.\n\nI believe their signature Ballpark ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=-4KQDWx35oYwrneUwjSPpQ) was also one of the earlier flavors I tried.  I thought the entire composition was genius, and yes, its components did remind me of things I've had at a ball game.  It's crunched up pieces of chocolate-covered pretzels, chopped peanuts and Anchor Steam beer all mixed within a creamy, rich Straus cream.  Totally awesome!\n\nYesterday, I went all out and had a double scoop consisting of Bourbon & Caramel and Fudge Ripple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=zcfLTHIT86XD2qmOkW9QSg) since San Francisco enjoyed a rare day of abundant sunshine.  As a whole I thought the two flavors combined very well together.  On their own however I thought the Fudge Ripple easily outflavored the Bourbon & Caramel.  Both flavors use the same delicious sweet cream.  The Fudge Ripple flavor had my tongue dancing though.  Mixed in with the sweet cream was big chunks of rich, gooey chocolate fudge mixed with chopped toasted almonds.  Meanwhile the Bourbon & Caramel was mostly sweet, sticky caramel.  For me anyway the bourbon flavor was a bit too subtle.\n\nAll in all though this is an amazing place for delicious ice cream, and a perfect place to fuel up prior to a Food Bank project.

Where else can you eat ice cream that is served to you by the very people who make it? \n- Everything is biodegradable and compostable, so you can feel good about eating there. \n- Their flavors are amazing. I haven't tried a flavor that I haven't loved: Cinnamon Toast, Salted Caramel, Halva, Sweet Corn Caramel, Earl Grey Tea, Burnt Sugar, Rum Raisin. Their flavors are the perfect balance between unique and delicious. I tend to think Humphrey's tries too hard to be unique and some of the flavors don't taste good at all. But this place gets it just right. You could literally pick a flavor blindly and you'd love it. \n- Their 10 flavors change daily so there's always something new and exciting to try. To find out what flavors they're offering today, friend them on Facebook!\n- Even though this couple works their butts off, they are always warm and welcoming to their customers. Even when I ask to sample flavor after flavor, they oblige with kind enthusiasm.\n- The shop is spacious, bright, clean and has plenty of seating and the cleanest bathroom ever. Also, plenty of free parking.\n- Water for customers: They have mason jars with water and biodegradable cups so you can cleanse your palette after devouring your ice cream\n\nIf you are reading this, do yourself a favor. Bookmark this place and make it a point to pay them a visit. You can thank me later :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-09-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I opted for the salted mango & caramel with sea salt.

Makes me just wanna stop writing this review and head over there for some!  It is 5 stars for the chocolate chip cookie alone!  I also tried the peanut brittle & toffee cookie.  Hubby loved this since he is a peanut lover.  I also enjoyed this cookie, but not as much as the chocolate chip!!!\n\nOn to the ice cream...I was hoping to try try the candied violet, earl gray, flan, tres leches, ballpark, peanut brittle and all the other flavors spoken highly of in other reviews the day I came, but being \"Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous\", none of those were being offered the day I came.  I opted for the salted mango & caramel with sea salt.  Salted Mango blew away the caramel with sea salt for me.  Very, very yummy.  The caramel with sea salt had a good balanced flavor...didn't really wow me.  My daughter had the jasmine green tea and caramel with sea salt.

The corn & caramel tasted like fresh corn in ice cream but without the corn chunks in it.  I couldn't really taste too much of the caramel since the corn overpowered it. Milk chocolate was delicious...can't really go wrong with chocolate.  My most favorite was the salted mango.  \n\nThey also make fresh peanut brittle and cones here.  I think the cone is an extra 50 cents.  Jr. Scoop is $2.75, Single scoop is $3.50. Double is $4.75.  The scoops here are very generous!  I believe there is also a $10 minimum for credit cards.\n\nOverall, my family & i enjoyed our experience at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous.  We enjoyed it more than Humphrey Slocombe.

I know I know, you're probably saying I should hop off my high horse; however I simply have zero damns to spare for you. Anyways Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous deserves my review and a lot more.\n\nLawd have mercy, I love their ice cream so damn much! This is one of those places that you'll remember when you're old with alzhiemers. Your future grandchildren will be eating dip-n-dots, and you'll be like \"I remember when we had real ice cream like from Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous!\" And your grandchildren will just laugh in disregard. \n\nI love the Mom-&-Pop-i-ness vibe i get from this place. The employees are always helpful and always seem to converse with customers with ease. I'm sure the employees know me here because I walk through the door yelling \"TAKE MY MONEY!!!\" They're located right across from Hard Knox. Ice cream after chicken & waffles? Yes please. If you're not lazy, the ballpark is a couple blocks away. Ice cream after a Giants game? Yes please. Parking in the area isn't much of a hassle compared to other hipster ice cream shops *ahem* Bi-Rite *ahem* \n\nEvery flavor always satisfies! The ice cream is a perfect balance of creaminess, sweetness and texture. Some flavors, like Bourbon Caramel and Banana Toffee, have a buttery component which ties the flavors together. Some flavors, like Crema Catalana and Honey Yogurt, have a perfectly light and refreshing quality. Whatever you like, they'll have something for you. My favorite flavors are Pink Squirrel and Candied Violet, but sometimes they don't have them that day. But, you see, that doesn't matter because all their flavors are so good. I'm always discovering random flavors that creep into the top of my ice cream favorites list! Unlike Bi-Rite, I find myself trying new flavors every visit, instead of the usual Salted Caramel or Ricanelas. Also, thanks to the Se\u00f1or Sisig collabo, they have Filipino-related flavors like Macapuno, Almond Jelly and a Turon-inspired flavor (banana + jackfruit), which are also a nice addition. I'm a fatty, so i usually order two scoops because I'm indecisive on which flavor to have. \n\nFor the most part, their extra stuff, like the toppings and baked goods, are made in-house. The waffle cones are made in-house and have the perfect sweetness and thickness. I havent tried any toppings (although the homemade caramel is always tempting), but I have tried some of the their baked good. The cookies with huge chocolate chunks are just as addicting as their ice cream. I compare their cookies to Anthony's Cookies, but a little bigger. Also they have a caramel-marshmallow thingy that is sooo bad for you, but is hella delicious. Im convinced, they can do no wrong if they just add their caramel to anything. The next thing i will have to buy is a jar of their Almond Brittle. If you're ever overwhelmed with the sweetness from anything, they have free water. The bathroom is always clean too. \n\nBascially, Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous is like a crack house, because I fiend for their products and i go there to get my fix. The only downside to everything I just said is that they close at 6pm and are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. I ain't eem mad though, they deserve a break after supplying the ice cream fiends.\n\nlol @ people going to Bi-Rite or Humphreys when Miscellaneous is open. \n\nHave I hyped up Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous enough for you? ...

It boggles my mind that they don't stay open later at least on Friday and Saturday when I see so many people in this neighborhood for dinner, drinks, etc. In addition, I made a special trip here to surprise a friend one Thursday, leaving work at 5pm to make it before closing time, only to find a note on the door that they randomly weren't open that day.  They are always doing mad business - I can't imagine that they couldn't support longer hours at least a couple of days a week.  Why not open later and close later?  Like, who is getting ice cream at 10am on a Wednesday??\n\nAnyway, I like this place but I wish it was more \"user friendly.\"", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-10-13"}, {"excerpts": ["I like to stick to the classic flavors such as banana, chicory coffee, and salted caramel.

There are canning jars large ($14) and small ($7) with their homemade peanut brittle. There's a cake dome with homemade toffee peanut brittle cookies ($2.50) and there are small canning jars with a variety of sprinkles or other toppings for ice cream. All so tempting. I picked up one of the small paper sacks of their homemade malted peanut butter balls ($4.50) which looked really tasty and I couldn't pass up.\n\nGood karma for me as I collected my double scoop of ice cream ($5) 'cos a tiny school-style table in the corner opened up. I snabbed it and was entertained watching the parade of couples, groups and families ordering and consuming their ice cream. When a couple sat down opposite me, I chatted with them since I spied the lady holding a jar of the peanut brittle. \"Is it buttery?,\" I ask. \"Yes, it's delicious and I can eat the whole jar in one sitting!\" says the lady. I pulled my bag of malted balls a little closer to me as she eyed my treats and says she can inhale these candies just as quick.\n\nFor sure when you are without a car, Mr. & Mrs Misc. is a bit of an effort to get to in the Dogpatch.

The service is awesome and both owners are very nice and friendly, and I really get the vibe that they love what they're doing, which definitely shows in their ice cream.\n\nChocolate Chip Ice Cream - this is more like vanilla ice cream with tons of dark chocolate shavings... very very good... esp the quality of chocolate they use. Almost milky, and the separation between chocolate and vanilla flavors was very delicate.\n\nPink Squirrel - almost tasted like almond gelato, but with a slightly creamier texture. Extremely delicious, and I could imagine myself going to China town and making and ice cream almond cookie sandwich. \n\nBurnt Sugar - if you like creme brulee or that slightly bitter sweet taste... oh boy you're in for a treat. This was soooo good, and it tastes exactly like the name suggests. I actually went back and ordered a pint of this mixed with vanilla to make a Creme Brulee (guy called me out on it).\n\nVanilla - Another very rich vanilla ice cream. I bought this along with the burnt sugar for my sister after polishing off my 3 scoop ice cream. My sister said this was the best vanilla ice cream she has had. Though not as custardy as other ice cream places, this one has very good quality and the vanilla is rich but not overwhelming. \n\nChicory Coffee - this is like Vietnamese Coffee turned into ice cream. A nice slight taste of chicory root a long with the coffee grounds adding texture created a good ice cream. This has quite a bit of caffeine in it for someone who isn't used to drinking coffee, so I was left with a nice buzz.

Drawbacks in the debate for superiority point to the area (Dogpatch) where Mr. and Mrs. is located, the lack of days and hours it is open, and the rotating and unpredictable flavor schedule.

Overall, Mr. and Mrs. takes extra time in their craft to deliver an ice cream that hardly ever disappoints. \n\nSome of the flavors that I have tried and endorse:\n\nBurnt Sugar (Yes, close to caramel, but has the darker tones of actual burnt sugar)\nWhite Rabbit (My Asian folks rejoice.

I'm going to take care of that now.\n\nI often use my lactose intolerance as an excuse to limit my intake on dairy, but on specific Tuesdays and Wednesdays each month that whole \"I can't have too much dairy\"-thing goes right out of the window.  I generally stop off at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous prior to volunteering at the San Francisco Food Bank located just four blocks away.  Often the reasoning is two-fold.  Why arrive too early inside a massive warehouse waiting for other volunteers to arrive when I could kill time inside a fabulous ice cream shop and have some fabulous ice cream to boot?  If I crunch enough enzyme tablets prior to my visits my lactose excuse simply disintegrates.\n\nI not only love the ice cream here, but everything I've tried has been magnificent whether that be the peanut or almond brittle, the malted milk balls or the crazy Peanut Brittle and Toffee Cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=9uxO9bcwXSjZ5qgjsrQTOg).  I normally like crunchy cookies over soft cookies, but these stand nicely in between with crispy edges and a soft, chewy center of buttery cookie with fabulous peanut brittle and soft toffee melted in.\n\nI've easily tried over twenty of their often-changing ice cream flavors, and over the months I have found a few favorites.  Their Nougat ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=InskBR3E7c-vh42WbKEaeA) was the first flavor I had ever tried.  If ever I experienced love at first bite this was it.  It's basically sweet cream from Marin's favorite Straus Family Dairy with organic pistachios and bits of dried fruit like cherries and apricots. The description is pretty simple, but the flavor was so intense.\n\nI believe their signature Ballpark ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=-4KQDWx35oYwrneUwjSPpQ) was also one of the earlier flavors I tried.  I thought the entire composition was genius, and yes, its components did remind me of things I've had at a ball game.  It's crunched up pieces of chocolate-covered pretzels, chopped peanuts and Anchor Steam beer all mixed within a creamy, rich Straus cream.  Totally awesome!\n\nYesterday, I went all out and had a double scoop consisting of Bourbon & Caramel and Fudge Ripple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=zcfLTHIT86XD2qmOkW9QSg) since San Francisco enjoyed a rare day of abundant sunshine.  As a whole I thought the two flavors combined very well together.  On their own however I thought the Fudge Ripple easily outflavored the Bourbon & Caramel.  Both flavors use the same delicious sweet cream.  The Fudge Ripple flavor had my tongue dancing though.  Mixed in with the sweet cream was big chunks of rich, gooey chocolate fudge mixed with chopped toasted almonds.  Meanwhile the Bourbon & Caramel was mostly sweet, sticky caramel.  For me anyway the bourbon flavor was a bit too subtle.\n\nAll in all though this is an amazing place for delicious ice cream, and a perfect place to fuel up prior to a Food Bank project.
