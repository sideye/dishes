My friends ordered a Pad Thai w/ Chicken and the Sriracha fried rice.\n\nI don't know how to say this, but the Pad Thai in general was awful awful. The beef was soggy, chewy, and tasteless. I had to pick the beef out from my dish because I was having a hard time swallowing it. I mean come on, you're making all the cows in the world look bad. You're not doing justice to their delicious meats. Undercooked and bland, it's literally the worst beef I've had in my life. \n\nOk, maybe I just had a bad dish. I turned to my right and my friend who ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken - she didn't even touch her dish. She prbly had like one or two bites of it and that was it. The noodles were undercooked, the chicken was dry. It was $9 for a dish so I guess while it's not super expensive, but I definitely expected more for my money's worth. Worst Thai dining experience ever.\n\nfinal thoughts: nope never coming back here, and I can not in my good conscience recommend this place to anyone. if you're insistent on coming here, then avoid the pad thai like the plague", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-10-19"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered spicy chicken wing as an appetizer, sriracha fried rice, green chicken curry and a side of steamed rice.

Since they don't take reservations, it was a 45 minute wait at around 8:00 pm. So, we opted for Sriracha his favorite Thai restaurant in the Inner Sunset area and were seated immediately as it was only half full.\n \nMy sister, who frequents Sirarcha, suggested some of her favorite dishes.  Needing another item, I was tasked with selecting an entr\u00e9e.  Our dishes:\n \nPad Se-Ew Shrimp - stirred fried rice noodle with shrimp and sweet soy sauce., Chinese broccoli, broccoli, carrot and egg.  Tasty with a slightly sweet flavor.\n \nPineapple fried rice with prawns, pineapple, egg, raisin, pea-carrot, onion and cashews. Rice had a good texture and dish had four good size prawns. \n \nSriracha fried rice with egg, chili, hot basil, onion, topped with grilled prawns and fried egg.  This dish was flavorful, but it does have a kick to it, especially to those that have a light tolerance to spice.\n \nKanah moo krob - stir fried roasted pork belly with Chinese broccoli, spicy chili garlic and black bean\nSauce - More of a Chinese stir fried dish with Chinese roast pork. Good, but didn't seem like a Thai dish.  Also, black bean sauce was light in black beans.\n \nGrilled chicken with Thai herbs, with sweet and sauce and fresh green salad.  My order, which my sister has not tried. It was grilled chicken breast that was a little on the dry side.  Probably my least favorite of our dishes.\n \nFried banana with coconut ice cream. Two egg rolls filled with bananas and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Creamy ice cream, but I have had better deep-fried bananas.\n \nFresh mango with sweet sticky rice - first time trying this dessert. It consisted of slices of fresh mango with a large scoop of sweet rice.\n \nOverall, very good Thai cuisine in good size portions with efficient friendly service. Nice option for Thai in the Inner Sunset.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-06-07"}], "pla dook pad ped": [], "pad geang keaw wan pla gry": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the Steamed Mussels (Appetizer), Grilled Chicken (Grilled), Pad Cha Talay (Sauteed), and Pad Geang Keaw Wan Pla Gry ", "Steamed Mussels: ", "Actually very good!

There was a lot of red curry sauce though, which was sweet and not very spicy.\n\nPad Geang Keaw Wan Pla Gry: Contrary to the Pad Cha Talay, the portion was a lot bigger (maybe because it is a Chef's Special).
