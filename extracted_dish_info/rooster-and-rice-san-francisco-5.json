Something that reminds me that life is worth living. \n\nI hopped on Yelp and saw that the Urban Picnic was replaced by Rooster & Rice, a place I had seen opened in the Marina, and now here it is - 2 blocks away from my work. Yay!\n\nUpon arriving at Rooster & Rice, i see the line. I expected this as San Franciscans are crazy. I don't usually like lines. Some people go just for the line, it seems, but I stay away. This is the first time, I actually stood in the line. I dunno... maybe it's because today the world is ending. I mean if the US is going to try something new - like elect a fascist, xenophobic, racist, sexist imbecile, then I can also try something new. Like stand in a line.\n\nUpon entry into the actual restaurant, I noticed that it was all asians and their more experimental non-asian friends. I don't know if I had ever seen so many asians in any other SOMA restaurant before. If Trump wanted to put all asians in an internment camp, they can make Rooster & Rice it's capital. He can just fence us all in like chickens.\n\nAnyhow, I got the original. DUH. the OG of course. Jesus - the marina? Really? I'm not judging. I'm just saying... I'm judging.\n\nEverything was pretty good and satisfying. As expected. The best thing was the broth which was super flavorful. Rice had a light flavor, which is fine. (Not as good as Hainanese chinese chicken, but it's fine.) Khao Mun Gai chicken is poached, where as Hainanese chicken is steamed - but end result is similar. Basically a very clean, chickeny flavor. \n\nThis is why only the most experimental of non-asians would ever come here - that poached chicken. I think it's something you grow up with. To the non-asians, it's just rubbery and too chickeny. There's a reason why chicken is battered and fried. Or smothered with bbq sauce. I actually don't love chicken ...but there is something nostalgic about eating poached / steamed chicken. Very comforting. \n\nThe ginger-soy sauce was of course delicious. You gotta have that right. I could talk about hainanese chicken sauce (which is a ginger scallion sauce), but I might have a gang of thai techies come beat me with a coconut hammer. \n\n(Aww.... don't get mad my Thai cousins... If it's any consolation, the Chinese don't do any noodle dishes as close to delicious as Tom Yum Noodle Soup.... mmmmm... Tom Yum Noodle Soup.)\n\nAnyhow... seriously I'd say the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it's not Hainanese Chicken Rice. And I know that's not fair. But you know what... Today, a person who lost the popular vote by 2 million votes is being sworn into office.

It also includes fresh chili ginger garlic with soybeans sauce and a small cup size of fresh chicken broth. As a result, that meal tasted flawless and outstanding! It compared and tasted like eating a Chinese styled chicken breast right directly from an Asian supermarket because of a distinct broth taste! Very clean and eatable to bite without any leftover bones around! The brown rice also cooked perfectly without being too harden and dry especially the sliced cucumbers. The sauce, da bomb goodness! I really tasted the ginger into my mouth along with a spicier taste of chili and garlic combined! Awesome sauce! Finally, the chicken broth tasted superior and naturally delicious just like slurping Sawnson's Chicken Broth. Not a bad meal for lunch!\n\nParking at Rooster & Rice can be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Rooster & Rice is the finest and most remarkable chicken food shop that I've ever visited for the very first time right here in San Francisco! Perfect for your lunch or dinner break needs! A well visit!

Something that reminds me that life is worth living. \n\nI hopped on Yelp and saw that the Urban Picnic was replaced by Rooster & Rice, a place I had seen opened in the Marina, and now here it is - 2 blocks away from my work. Yay!\n\nUpon arriving at Rooster & Rice, i see the line. I expected this as San Franciscans are crazy. I don't usually like lines. Some people go just for the line, it seems, but I stay away. This is the first time, I actually stood in the line. I dunno... maybe it's because today the world is ending. I mean if the US is going to try something new - like elect a fascist, xenophobic, racist, sexist imbecile, then I can also try something new. Like stand in a line.\n\nUpon entry into the actual restaurant, I noticed that it was all asians and their more experimental non-asian friends. I don't know if I had ever seen so many asians in any other SOMA restaurant before. If Trump wanted to put all asians in an internment camp, they can make Rooster & Rice it's capital. He can just fence us all in like chickens.\n\nAnyhow, I got the original. DUH. the OG of course. Jesus - the marina? Really? I'm not judging. I'm just saying... I'm judging.\n\nEverything was pretty good and satisfying. As expected. The best thing was the broth which was super flavorful. Rice had a light flavor, which is fine. (Not as good as Hainanese chinese chicken, but it's fine.) Khao Mun Gai chicken is poached, where as Hainanese chicken is steamed - but end result is similar. Basically a very clean, chickeny flavor. \n\nThis is why only the most experimental of non-asians would ever come here - that poached chicken. I think it's something you grow up with. To the non-asians, it's just rubbery and too chickeny. There's a reason why chicken is battered and fried. Or smothered with bbq sauce. I actually don't love chicken ...but there is something nostalgic about eating poached / steamed chicken. Very comforting. \n\nThe ginger-soy sauce was of course delicious. You gotta have that right. I could talk about hainanese chicken sauce (which is a ginger scallion sauce), but I might have a gang of thai techies come beat me with a coconut hammer. \n\n(Aww.... don't get mad my Thai cousins... If it's any consolation, the Chinese don't do any noodle dishes as close to delicious as Tom Yum Noodle Soup.... mmmmm... Tom Yum Noodle Soup.)\n\nAnyhow... seriously I'd say the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it's not Hainanese Chicken Rice. And I know that's not fair. But you know what... Today, a person who lost the popular vote by 2 million votes is being sworn into office.

My SF cynicism expected a gentrified version that would lose the original flavors and toss in random avocados and stuff (I do laugh at their poached egg option), but the complex flavors and superb quality exceeded my expectations. My favorite turned out to be the rice: the robust, fragrant chicken flavoring was memorable, and the unconventional amount of al dente-ness was a pleasant surprise. The sauce brought everything together in layers of sweet soy sauce blended with ginger, scallions, beans, and chili. I also opted for some habanero sauce (mainly to make my picture look more colorful), which added a mild creaminess.\n\nBecause of the distractingly good sauces, I found it difficult to evaluate the chicken itself. The chicken in this dish is always intentionally plain so you can fully appreciate the chicken essence. I think the use of Mary's chicken inherently has a different chicken-ness compared to the \"yellow-haired chicken\" (\u9ec3\u6bdb\u96de) traditionally used, so it's difficult to evaluate the poaching technique. The chicken broth was richly flavored and steamy, the perfect heart-warming addition to any lunch in chilly SF days.\n\nNote that although it ins't your typical greasy food, the liberal use of chicken fat and various sauces make it a more filling lunch than you'd expect from a chicken meal.

The chicken in the bowl was lean yet very tender and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered The Marina because he doesn't like when chicken is fatty or has skin, but I actually think that he would've been just as happy with The Original. The chicken in The Original (even the thigh) was just as lean, and I actually didn't get any skin in my bowl. That last part might be a big negative to some, but I didn't mind much. The broth was good too. Full of flavor, and not heavy or oily.\n\nThe jasmine rice was like the rice that's usually included in Hainan chicken dishes, in that it was very flavorful on its own. For that reason, don't dump the whole sauce container over the rice! The sauce is SUPER delicious, but if you put too much into the bowl, it can overpower the flavors of the chicken and the rice. Same goes for the optional Thai sriracha and the habanero sauce that they offer. SO good, but be careful how much you use because the bowl is far from bland even without them. \n\nWould this be 5 stars if this was cheaper? Definitely.

Yay!\n\nUpon arriving at Rooster & Rice, i see the line. I expected this as San Franciscans are crazy. I don't usually like lines. Some people go just for the line, it seems, but I stay away. This is the first time, I actually stood in the line. I dunno... maybe it's because today the world is ending. I mean if the US is going to try something new - like elect a fascist, xenophobic, racist, sexist imbecile, then I can also try something new. Like stand in a line.\n\nUpon entry into the actual restaurant, I noticed that it was all asians and their more experimental non-asian friends. I don't know if I had ever seen so many asians in any other SOMA restaurant before. If Trump wanted to put all asians in an internment camp, they can make Rooster & Rice it's capital. He can just fence us all in like chickens.\n\nAnyhow, I got the original. DUH. the OG of course. Jesus - the marina? Really? I'm not judging. I'm just saying... I'm judging.\n\nEverything was pretty good and satisfying. As expected. The best thing was the broth which was super flavorful. Rice had a light flavor, which is fine. (Not as good as Hainanese chinese chicken, but it's fine.) Khao Mun Gai chicken is poached, where as Hainanese chicken is steamed - but end result is similar. Basically a very clean, chickeny flavor. \n\nThis is why only the most experimental of non-asians would ever come here - that poached chicken. I think it's something you grow up with. To the non-asians, it's just rubbery and too chickeny. There's a reason why chicken is battered and fried. Or smothered with bbq sauce. I actually don't love chicken ...but there is something nostalgic about eating poached / steamed chicken. Very comforting. \n\nThe ginger-soy sauce was of course delicious. You gotta have that right. I could talk about hainanese chicken sauce (which is a ginger scallion sauce), but I might have a gang of thai techies come beat me with a coconut hammer. \n\n(Aww.... don't get mad my Thai cousins... If it's any consolation, the Chinese don't do any noodle dishes as close to delicious as Tom Yum Noodle Soup.... mmmmm... Tom Yum Noodle Soup.)\n\nAnyhow... seriously I'd say the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it's not Hainanese Chicken Rice. And I know that's not fair. But you know what...

You can choose between poached white meat or white/dark meat, and brown rice (+1 extra) or jasmine rice. The chicken is extremely tender and the rice is fragrant (they call it chicken rice). There is a side of sauce (ginger and garlic sauce = THE BOMB) and they have Habanero hot sauce and Thai Sriracha (I use a combo of both). My favorite part is the broth they give you on the side - I'm not sure how they do it but it is the cleanest yet most flavorful chicken broth I've ever had! Really my favorite part!!! They also sell a limited selection of drinks as well as whole baby coconuts if you want fresh coconut water :)\n\nThis location is open Mon - Fri and closes at 8pm.

After a long day at work, I was really craving something simple and delicious and Rooster & Rice was just around the corner. \n\nI have never had Khao Mun Gai, which is a Thai version of Hainanese chicken rice, but I have had Hainanese chicken rice countless times in the past. I ordered their Original (around $12 with tax). Their Original is a combination of chicken thigh and breast all boneless on a wonderful bed of fragrant rice with a side of chicken broth. The Asian me screams thigh meat is the way to go for all chicken dishes since chicken breasts are often super dry and tasteless. However, their chicken breast meat super tender, flavorful, and juicy. When I took a bite of their chicken with a scoop of the rice with a little bit of their habanero hot sauce, I was in full chicken heaven bliss. Not only is their chicken good, but the rice is packed with chicken oils and flavor. I have not tasted a chicken rice this flavorful in a very long time. Many Chinese places serve Hainanese chicken rice, but most of them fail to deliver juicy chicken and flavorful rice. This place has PERFECTED their chicken and their rice. \n\nOnce I took the first bite of this mega flavorful chicken and rice, I couldn't stop myself from finishing the entire box. Put some of their housemade sweet, sour, garlicky, gingery sauce and the housemade habanero sauce onto the chicken rice to give it the most perfect spice and flavorful kick. If you find yourself in need of some veggies, you can crunch on little pieces of cucumber that are given as a side. If you want to wash down your chicken rice with some liquid, you can drink their super flavorful chicken broth. You will be in full chicken heaven!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-05-09"}]}
