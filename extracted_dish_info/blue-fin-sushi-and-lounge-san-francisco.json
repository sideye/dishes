I made sure to ask so we were not billed differently since we were in the lounge before happy hour ended and the great waitress we had, checked and said it is off the total bill so we were able to enjoy a few happy hour prices with our yelp deal.

Parking is pretty troublesome; restaurant decor is modern and the screaming happy hour deals are a sign that patrons aren't exactly rushing in over the quality of the food.

The Seab(r)eam Tataki was also a pretty fair combination of flavors that I enjoyed. Finally the butterfish sashimi was something I've never tried and tasted fresh and clean. \n\nMost items however left a mediocre impression. All nigiri & sashimi (excluding the butterfish) looked (in the display at the sushi bar) and tasted a little old. Some were slightly grainy, some had a tough texture, and all simply did not have a fresh taste. Most disappointing was the uni: the quality was poor; the sacs were destroyed or simply purchased as low quality. The taste was slightly metallic-like and utterly disappointing. December is supposed to be the ideal month isn't it??\n\nThe takoyaki was average, not scalding hot as it should be, and scanty on the octopus; the miso scallops were overcooked; the poke salad was poorly balanced, the rolls were just a mush of flavor, etc. etc. you get the idea, the meal came off in the end as mediocre and slightly disappointing- that should earn a place 3 stars. 1 more star off because as I lie here writing this review, my stomach is churning and definitely not happy.

All I ask is that you take my order, give me my food, and just don't be an a** about it. \n\nI came here with a friend on a Saturday night.  Place was pretty crowded, but we were given a table immediately. The guy who sat us was pretty friendly. The waitress who served us was not.  \n\nAfter we looked at the menu and figured out what we wanted, we closed it and waited for the waitress to come by.  After 5 minutes...we still didn't see her. By that time I had to make a restroom run.  When I came back, my friend was still not able to flag her down.  So I'm swiveling my head around  like a ping pong match spectator trying to spot her. When I finally saw her, I waved my hand around to get her attention.  She completely ignored us. By this time, we have been sitting down for close to 20 minutes without even being ACKNOWLEDGED by our waitress, and my patience ran thin.  I understand that you might be busy, but the least you can do is come by and tell us you'll be a few minutes. That way we know you actually KNOW we're here.  When I finally see her serving the table behind us I call out \" Excuse me!.....\"  and before I could even finish my sentence she yells out rudely \" YES,... I SEE YOU HOLD ON\" .\n\nAt this point, I am BEYOND angry.  Excuse me? We've been sitting here for 20 minutes and you act like we're BOTHERING you when we want you to take our order? If we weren't so damn hungry at the time we probably would've walked out.\n\nSo a couple of minutes later she comes by (no apologies or anything)...and huffily asks us what we want without making any eye contact with us. \n\n\nWe ordered :\n\nNama Kaki  (Raw oysters with uni and quail eggs) 15.95\nAlbacore Tataki   8.50\nVolcano Roll  9.50\nSpicy Tuna Roll 5.95\n\nNow the food was actually very good, especially the Nama Kaki.

Parking definitely sucks around this area or we just had really bad luck when we came, spots were being snatched up right in front of us. \n\nThis place was surprisingly a lot smaller than I expected, especially from seeing the outside storefront. But half of it is a restaurant and the other half is a lounge. Not sure what the lounge offers other than drinks, or if you can also get food there? I didn't read the other yelp reviews that closely before going. \n\nMy husband and I came on a Friday night at 7:30pm, but we called ahead and made reservations figuring it would be PACKED on a friday night. I think we got lucky on that note because it wasn't packed or as busy as we thought it woudl be. It's a small place so it doesn't hold a lot of tables, but there were a few empty tables when we arrived. \n\nFirst off, they give you a bowl of complimentary edamame. A total plus because hardly any sushi places that I've been to ever gives complimentary edamame. Downside is that the edamame wasn't fully cooked, it was hard to pop the beans out of the pods. You should be able to bite into it and slide the bean out easily. This one you had to gnarl on it to get it out. But hey it's free! \n\nWe ordered the Chicken Kara-age because it looked different than the normal chicken bites, this one was on the end of a bone, like a chicken wing with the meat pulled down to form a lollipop. It was very yummy and crispy. Mhmm good. \n\nAnother appetizer we ordered was the Salmon and Tuna Tartare. It came with a side salad on the plate which was yummy to have some fresh greens with japanese food. The tartare wasn't as fabulous as I would've thought, it was still good but I could hardly taste the salmon in the tartare, the tuna was overpowering it. I would've loved just a salmon tartare by itself. Still good, it's just a personal preference. Also in typical-tartare fashion, it came with wonton chips to spoon the tartare on to eat. But oddly it also came with shrimp chips. \n\nA definite plus side that my husband and I totally appreciated was the price for sashimi. Usually sashimi for us is super duper expensive that we can't justify getting as an appetizer. Here at Blue Fin Sushi, this wasn't an issue. Super reasonable pricing. And the sashimi was fresh too. We ordered the Salmon sashimi and the Shiro Maguro (white tuna). Mhmmm both yummy. \n\nWe also ordered a few rolls - yes we were being heffers, but we had a $60 yelp deal to use up. The rolls were all awesome, we got the Romeo & Juliet, Ice Land Roll and the Volcano Roll. They were all soo soo good. The only slight downside is the Volcano Roll was stuck to the foil after baking it, so it was a chore to get it off the foil. They need to use spray-on oil before baking, it would help a lot. \n\nOverall, great place to eat, great service, great food, parking sucks! And prices about reasonable. \n\nAt the end of the meal, they give you an orange for palate cleansing and dessert. Also another point to note, great service! Anytime we had a plate that was empty of even chopstick wrapper, there was always someone to swoop by and pick it up. They were super diligent! Love great service!

I've never had sushi in San Francisco that I thought wasn't at least ok until now.  Rice was cold and gooey, shrimp from their tempura rolls must have been sitting around for a while.\n\nI went here on a Saturday night at about 8:30pm -- right during prime time dinner hours -- because my cousin was in town and had a sushi craving.  This was the fourth or fifth place we tried because of course during prime-time on a Saturday night, all of the good places had a long wait.  The fact that this place could seat us right away should have been the first clue.\n\nSaturday during dinner hour you would hope that the turnover in the food and presumably the A-team kitchen staff would make the food at its best and freshest.  We had a small assortment of sushi -- New York Roll (shrimp tempura), Kappa Maki, Inari, FutoMaki, and one of their premium rolls with salmon and seaweed salad on top.\n\nThe rice was the worst I've had in any sushi restaurant.  It was quite cool and obviously not fresh.  It had no bite to it at all -- in fact it was a little overcooked and gooey and was sitting like a rock in my stomach a few hours later.  The shrimp tempura in the New York roll was heavily breaded, soggy, and cold.  It had obviously been cooked several hours before and had been sitting around, although from the heavy batter I doubt it had ever been very good.  The miso soup and wakame salad were fine, but seriously how hard are those to get wrong?\n\nThis place would still have gotten one-star from me but it didn't help that the kitchen also lost most of my order.  With the restaurant half-empty, this place still couldn't figure out that we had received only one of the seven dishes we ordered.  I had to get up from the table and track down a waiter to complain.  But as I said, this place was already a one-star before the service gaffe.  They were polite and apologetic but the damage was done.\n\nThis is the only sushi I've ever had that was worse than no sushi at all.

Seabeam Tataki, I love lightly seared fish and the jalapeno gave it a kick. \n\nThe BAD:  Spicy Crunchy Maki:  I don't understand how Yelpers actually enjoyed this.

The fish tasted fishy and we ended up pushing it aside.   \n\nOverall, the decor was nice and it got somewhat busy on a Wednesday evening.  They have a bar/lounge area through a doorway.
