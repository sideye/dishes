I mean we wait until it's too late (and by late I don't mean 10PM, I mean 6 or so - hey, with 2 kids we need to eat a bit early) to make any plans and then we struggle to find a place that a) looks appealing, b) doesn't cost a ton (this is SF after all), and c) isn't already packed.\n\nSo on this day we were wandering around the Mission, checking out the cool shops and letting time pass us by.  It was around 6 when we decided that we must eat.  We passed a few places by - too full of hipsters, too expensive...etc, when we stumbled upon Regalito.  The menu looked good, albeit a bit steep for uppity Mexican food, but we weren't going to let that deter us.  After all, we've learned that we should eat at the first place that seems decent or we could pay the consequences of our poor decision-making.\n\nRegallito is a nice looking restaurant, with fairly modern, clean decor and only a handful of tables.  As I said before, the menu seemed to have some traditional Mexican dishes, but with a healthier, California twist.\n\nWe started with the Tortilla soup, which was honestly the best tortilla soup ever!\nFor the main, I chose the veggie Enchiladas stuffed with nopal (cactus).  Meh.  It took a while before I noticed the nopales, and even then there wasn't much flavor.  Price $18.  Ouch.\n\nMy wife ordered the Pollo Regalito which was tasty - well spiced with good sides.  Note that everything was jammed onto a smallish plate.  A bigger plate would have been a lot easier to eat from.  Price $17.  Ouch.\n\nMy son chose the Carne Asada.  Not a ton of carne for the price, but it was good quality and well-seasoned.  He liked it.  Price $22.  Holy crap!\n\nThere is a theme here.  Yes, we knew it was a bit pricey before we sat down.  But we also expected something extraordinary, not just a medium step up from the typical Mexican places found in the Mission.  Yes, the food was good, but not $70 for dinner good. I guess we paid for the good service, nice decor, and superior ingredients.\n\nNext time we'll save some money and go to the nondescipt Mexican restaurants that serve similar dishes for half the price.

In fact, Regalito is exactly the type of clean, modern-looking place you'd find along a side street in Mexico's culinary capital.\n\nMake no mistake that in a neighborhood full of great south-of-the-border eateries, this one stands out for the fresh ingredients they use in some interesting variations on basic Mexican dishes. Standing out in its own building on 18th Street between Valencia and Lexington, the small, tidy place inside has a warm vibe with a bright chartreuse hue on the walls and stainless steel and beech wood on the lengthy counter.\n\nI ordered the $12.50 Pollo Con Mole Negro, which is a quarter-chicken, free-range of course, covered in a thick Oaxacan mole full of chiles, nuts, and spices. It came with stewed pinto beans and rice. Tasty and the breast-dominated chicken was cooked to the right tenderness. My friend had the simpler $9.50 Pollo Regalito, which is the leg and thigh of a chicken marinaded in garlic, lime and chiles. It also came with the beans and rice.\n\nBarely three months old, they also offer pork, steak and veggie dishes which I look forward to trying some other time. There are also a bevy of appetizers and side dishes of which we just ordered the $3 Salsa Fresca y Tostadas, a bowl of incredibly fresh tomato, onion and chile salsa with deep-dried tortilla rounds you need to break apart to scoop up the salsa.  Yummy and just enough of a teaser for the entree.\n\nThey even offer a $9.95 \"Mexican worker's lunch\" consisting of agua fresca, a chosen entree (today it was a pork dish), dessert or coffee. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. The staff is friendly and incredibly quiet though not in a dysfunctional way since I am making the grand presumption that it is a family-run place.\n\nKeep in mind that it is small (just three tables and the counter), so I imagine weekend waits are a given.

I should clarify that this goes for taco shop Mexican fare only. Aside from Mariscos, I have been unimpressed with SD's selection of sit-down and regional Mexican cuisine. Although I recently lived in Mar Vista, LA where every Mexican restaurant happens to be Oaxacan and specialize in mole, Regalito does a much better job. \n\nI probably don't need to credentialize myself by noting that I have been to Oaxaca or recounting my numerous encounters with different types of moles. I will say though that this place does it right. I came in with the wifey and a couple of friends last night for dinner and had to have the mole. They had some pork mole enchiladas, but I had envisioned a half of a chicken smothered in the rich, delicious sauce. The waiter said that he could have the chef do the mole with chicken enchiladas, shredded chicken, or the roasted chicken. Score! Although they initially gave me just the breast, they added in the thigh, competing the half chicken promptly upon request and without questions. I love how flexible and accommodating they were about this. It really shows that they care about their customers. \n\nAs for the mole itself, amazing! I tore it up. A friend ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole for her first mole experience and had to save the last one to bring home for her husband to try. She was really impressed about how flavorful the sauce was while not sweet or excessively spicy. We also got the guac, which is a bit pricey at $10, but it is huge. The four of us did not finish it. It is also made very fresh and is delicious. \n\nThe wifey got the cochinita pibil, which she thought was a miss. I think I have had better versions, but enjoyed the flavors.

"], "author": "Floyd R.", "review": "I tried dining here once before when I was REALLY hungry.  After enduring a reasonable wait (we had no reservations), we were seated at the counter.  This afforded me the opportunity to watch some great tortilla making, as well as food being prepared with fresh ingredients.   I enjoyed having the kitchen right across from the counter, as I am somewhat of a culinary voyeur.  But, after waiting over 20 minutes and never being acknowledged by anyone, my stomach told me that I should come back when I could wait a while without getting sick.  Yes, they lost my business to a less posh but totally delicious Mission restaurant.\n\nI returned to Regalito last night (a Thursday) in order to redeem a Groupon that I bought after my initial visit.  This time, I packed my patience.  When I arrived, we were quoted a 15 minute wait time- reasonable.  \n\nWe killed the first 15 minutes doing some produce shopping in the neighborhood.  The next 15 minutes were spent sitting outside.  We chatted with some guests that were dining at one of their outdoor tables about their fear that the server had abandoned them- yikes!  This prompted us to check on our status.  The server inside said that  it would be a few more minutes and she would try to get us a table *wink/nudge*.  Literal wink.  As though we are getting the insider VIP treatment.\n\nBut alas, I packed my patience.  More importantly, I packed my Groupon that was already paid for!  Nothing was going to make me leave.  Within 10 minutes after receiving the \"wink-of-assurance\", we were seated at a table.  YAY!  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant was very warm and welcoming.  It is quite cozy (small), so discussing top secret info might be risky.  I could clearly hear everything that the table 6 inches away from mine was saying.  \n\nOn to the food!  We split two appetizers and two entrees.  To start: Guacamole con Tostados and the Taquitos de Pollo.  It was pretty cool watching the guacamole and tostados being made to order.  My only criticism is that the guacamole was pretty bland.  It lacked acidity and any level of complexity in flavor.  Pretty much tasted like delicious avocado mushed with a few tomatoes here and there.  I really liked the Taquitos de Pollo- crispy, densely packed with pollo, fresh flavors.\n\nI asked the server for recommendations for our entrees.  She said we should definitely try the Cochinita Pibil, which is citrus and achiote marinated pork wrapped in a banana leaf served with habanero and pickled onions.  HELL YEAH!  Sounds like a party on my palate.  The other recommendations that she gave were Tacos de Pescado and Enchiladas Verdes.  Since the fish of the say was arctic char, I went with the fish tacos.  \n\nUnfortunately when our entrees were to come out, the server only brought the Tacos de Pescado and informed us that the restuarant was out of the Cochinita de Pebil.  \"No big deal, I will get the enchiladas verdes\", I told the server.  But I was really pretty bummed.  The pork dish really sounded interesting.  \n\nThe fish tacos were quite good.  Again, the homemade tortillas come into play.  The fish tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly.  By the time we finished the fish tacos, the enchiladas were being delivered to the table.  The kitchen did a good job of getting the new entree out asap.  \n\nThe enchiladas were just ok.  The chicken inside was bland.  And the enchiladas were more like folded chicken tacos with a fine chunky salsa verde instead of a smooth green enchilada sauce on top along with some onion, queso fresco and crema.  I really would not recommend this dish. \n\nOverall, the food was hit and miss.  The service was much better on my second visit, but I can't speak to the consistency of service.  I think that the people outside felt abandoned because there was really only one server and a food runner attending to all of the tables in the restaurant.   If you plan on dining here, get a reservation and know that the service may be slower.  The food is more expensive than your average Mission restaurant, but if you care about eating fresh authentic food or ambiance (which I value much less) the price is pretty reasonable.  \n\nWill I be back?

I think this is the thing that grabbed my nose. It's pork wrapped in banana leaf and stewed with cocaine and magical fairy dust (disclaimer: not really cooked with cocaine and magical fairy dust). The color is a deep red and the flavor is phenomenal, thanks to the 5-6 hrs of stewing in a pot. Served w/ black beans, pickled red onion and tortillas. Unbelievable.  \n\nI missed out on the special of the day, which was Mexican pork chops (as it was explained to me). Learn from my mistake: find out the daily special before committing to regular fare off of the menu.\n\n\nATTN Snooty-Poos: This restaurant is very clean. Absence of sticky floors/surfaces.

Now, for my dish, the chicken was pretty dry and quite bland by itself (especially compared to say the nearby Limon).  But the sauce was quite tasty.  Ian's dish was pork and beans.  Seriously, that was it.  The pork was kind of tastless and the beans were beans.  It's like that Weezer song, only, the Weezer song sounded better than the dish tasted.

I had high hopes that Regalito would demonstrate the breadth of Mexican cooking beyond what is typically found in the taqueria.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  I felt that too many elements were not fresh (commercial tortillas!), lacked flavor, and disappointed in execution.   The kitchen is open to seats at the bar, and if I hadn't seen my meal being made in front of me, I might question my disappointment.   \n\nWe started with Chicken Taquitos and Ensalada de Nopalitos (cactus).  The taquitos were pulled our of a warming tray below the stove, and warmed before serving.  Flavorless, not crispy, and you can get better for a third of the price anywhere on the block.  The Ensalada de Nopalitos was basically nopalitos out of a jar, thrown on to the grill for a minute, with salsa on top.  Nothing special about this, nothing you couldn't do in your house, and for $8.50, I expected better (a big jar costs about $2.50 at any grocery store).  \n\nThe reason Regalito gets two stars instead of none is their Cochinita Pibil (slow-cooked pork served in a banana leaf).  This was the only thing I tried that one can't find down the street better and cheaper in any taqueria, and it was AWESOME.  Flavorful, cooked to perfection, and made up for the tortillas not being fresh or homemade.  \n\nDessert was the last straw with the lack of freshness here.  We had the Capirotada (warm bread pudding with vanilla ice cream).  Upon ordering, we found out that they were out of vanilla ice cream, and only had mango or avocado.  We ordered the avocado on the side, which was great, but definitely didn't go with bread pudding with apples and raisins.

Regalito is a wonderful, small, local (hardcore local too: the owner lives just a few blocks away) restaurant making great food that would be far too much trouble to make at home.\n\nThe carne con chilie colorado was outstanding - with spiced, full flavored stewed beef; the refritos; and the warm, freshly made thick tortillas. The spice builds and was spot on in intensity. It is not for the weak of palate.\n\nI could have eaten a plate of just the beans, rice, and ranchero sauce accompanying the chile relleno de calabazas y maiz and left happy, but luckily for me there was all that cheese and perfectly cooked veggies. It even pleased a couple of meat-eaters.\n\nWine by the bottle choices are reasonable and pair well with the food too. We had a red from Uraguay - a fun change of pace.\n\nI can't wait for the height of corn season so I can dig into their elote.\n\nWith all entrees under $20, Regalito is a crazy bargain for the quality.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-02"}, {"excerpts": ["One special of the evening, roast lamb with New Mexico chili sauce, Enchiladas Verdes, chile relleno de Calabazas y Maiz, and Cochinita Pibil.

Ordering a carafe of white Sangria, we settled in with two appetizers; Quacamole con Tostadas and Papas con Chorizo. The quacamole is ample with fresh salsa and served with whole fried corn tortillas. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would considering I'm not a huge fan of salsa (I'm getting better at this). But the fried potatoes with the chorizo, queso fresco and crema was a clear winner amongst all of us. I could eat a whole plate of this...\n\nAnother carafe of the fabulous sangria came with the four entr\u00e9es of the evening.

The bread pudding was HUGE and while I enjoyed the caramel sauce, it was a bit on the gummy side. Everyone loved the churros as well. They were obviously very fresh, but a still a bit gooey on the inside, I thought. The hot chocolate was superb. With tip, $50 a person.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-09-13"}]}
