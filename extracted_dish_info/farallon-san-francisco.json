It was a bit of a risk too, knowing my girlfriend was not the biggest seafood fan since she has never really been blown away by seafood meals. But she absolutely loved the food here and proclaimed it to be the best seafood she has tried. I have to agree, this was some top notch food. \n\nFor parking, we actually parked in the structure for the Westfield Mall, and after hanging out around Powell and Union Square for a bit just walked over to the restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance here was great. We were seated upstairs so it was rather romantic, but the ocean theme of the restaurant makes the place feel fun and not overly romantic as well (thank you jellyfish lamps). Our service started off great, but I have to dock some points since by the end of the meal our service was rather slow and our waitress seemed stoic and unhappy. Maybe she got some bad news mid-meal...not sure.\n\nWe decided to stray away from the prix fixe menu, and ended up ordering a lot of food. But the portion sizes were perfect for us to be full enough by the end of dinner so that we did not want dessert, but were still able to walk and not feel bloated. As a starter we ordered the grand platter, which included some of the freshest raw shellfish I have tried. The lobster was very juicy and fresh, and came with a champagne dip that complimented it nicely. The oysters and shrimp were also amazingly fresh and delicious. The crab was probably my favorite, though as far as shellfish goes.\n\nAs an appetizer we ordered the truffle linguini. The pasta was well cooked and not too hard or too soft. The truffles were a wonderful compliment to the pasta and its garlic sauce, and overall the dish tasted buttery but not too salty. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this dish, and found ourselves using our bread to soak up any remaining sauce on the plate.\n\nOur entrees were the pan seared local petrale sole and the roasted Alaskan true cod. The sole came on top of a risotto and some melted leeks. The sole was perfectly cooked, crispy skin and a very light crisp on the top side of the fish, but soft, flaky and not too chewy otherwise. The risotto, though, was a little heavily salted and really needed the vegetables to be balanced out. The cod was also perfectly cooked like the sole, but had a weaker flavor overall than the sole did. However, the chowder that the cod rested on top of included some pancetta and corn, and complimented the fish a lot better than the risotto did with the sole. So overall, both dishes were delicious, and at this point I am just nitpicking. \n\nI only hope that the service is a little quicker next time, since our service was a bit slow.

My bf asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner, and I chose Farallon.  It pains me to give a 2 star review but here goes.\n\nUpon arrival at the facade of the restaurant, we waited for the valet in one of the two lanes on Post St. who was no where in sight.  Since, there was no actual open space in front of the restaurant, we circled around once more not to idle on Post St. blocking traffic before calling to ask if there was an actual valet.  We were advised if we waited long enough on Post St. a valet would come to our aid.  So we gave it another shot.  They eventually rushed to park our car once several other patrons piled up behind us.\n\nOnce I entered the into the oceanic opulence of Farallon, I assumed the rest of my experience would be just as expected.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  We were several minutes early for our dinner reservations and decided to marinate at the bar until our table was ready.  Two Grey Goose Dirty martinis please!  I was taken by surprise.  These dirty martinis consisted mostly of watered down olive juice.  How do you screw up a dirty martini?  Needless to say, we refused to order any more cocktails during the rest of our wait.\n\nEventually, we were led to our table which was next to the rail in front of the exposed kitchen.  As we were seated, a booth table to our left was vacant, and I asked the hostess if it was possible for us to be seated there instead.  She advised me that table was reserved.  Once we were seated, I expected four people to be seated in that booth.  However, only a white couple was seated.  I sat there pondering what the difference between their reservation and mine was.  I could only gather that either they paid extra money to be seated there or simply, we were an ethnic couple, and they weren't.  Nevertheless, this was a minor component of the conglomeration of disappointment to come.\n\nAdditionally, the adjacent table received bread and beverage before us!  (We asked for bread twice:  once to the server and the second time our requests were answered via the runner.)  Once, our bottle of wine arrived, I was mildly impressed when the wine director came to our table to discuss our wine.  (At this point, I had a glimmer of hope left for Farallon despite the sour taste of seating arrangements and initial service.)  As the night proceeded, our server was fairly attentive by removing our dishes full of shellfish discards and maintaining her affable personality.  We enjoyed  the Grand platter, baby spinach salad, caviar and grilled octopus.   At the end of our meal, she brought me a tiny dessert with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" drizzled in chocolate syrup. I enjoyed the baby spinach salad with strawberries, thin radish slices and bits of parmesan.  I couldn't help but to be amused by Chef Franz's smile when he smiled catching me snapping pictures of his tasty culinary creations.  Undoubtedly, the experience at Farallon must never relate to his culinary skills.  His food is quite exquisite.  \n\nUnfortunately, I anticipated greater things here prior to my visit.  My visit did not satiate the fine dining standards as expected according to existing Yelp reviews.    My bf must have eaten a bad oyster or something on our Grand  Platter that evening.  He spewed it and everything else into the  porcelain god that evening, but I, luckily, evaded a similar misfortune.\n\nI did not expect Farallon to disappoint so much.

Mr. Franz opened the restaurant with restaurateur Pat Kuleto, who created the outrageous \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" dcor, with  hand-blown jellyfish lamps, kelp bedlike backlit columns, glass clamshells, sea-urchin light fixtures, a sea-life mosaic floor, and a tentacle-encircled Jellyfish Bar.\n\nI started off with a \"Original Mai-Tai\" on a velour couch in the bar area.  It was an odd rum martini that lacked sufficient sweetener, but the whimsical dcor and friendly service made up for the disappointment.  We were seated upstairs in a comfortable intimate booth.

Too often, soft shell crab just tastes fried. This had great depth.\n\nLittle gems salad with smoked trout was very good but a really paltry portion (Waitress warns up front that portions are \"petite,\" but c'mon, we're talking mostly lettuce here). My octopus appetizer was very nicely cooked, very tender and toasted pine nuts were a nice complement. Summer melon salad was just OK.\n\nMain courses were a bit of a letdown. Halibut was in a pretty unexciting sauce. Both the accompanying shelling beans and squash were very bland. Fish was well cooked, but overall dish was a bore. Salmon was also ehh. The sweet corn ravioli on the side was richly flavored, but the apple smoked bacon just didn't go with the salmon. Maybe pancetta would have worked better, but those two tastes together just didn't work for me (even though bacon usually improves everything!). Friend's sturgeon kept up the trend.

There are arches and domes and cool light fixtures (some shaped like sea urchins, some like jelly fish) and ocean-themed mosaics everywhere!\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nFIRST COURSE: My friend ordered the \"Hawaiian Hand Line Caught Ahi Tuna Tartare\" (with \"hickory smoked hearts of palm, roasted asian pears, [and] toasted sesame seeds\"). I ordered the comparatively tame \"Star Route Farms Mixed Lettuces\" (with \"sierra beauty apples, toasted pistachios, [and] cider-whole grain mustard vinaigrette\").

We ordered the \"Grilled Sacramento Delta Sturgeon\" (with \"artichoke heart puree, balsamic glazed brussel sprouts, [and] brown butter hollandaise\") and the \"Grilled Creekstone Farms Petite Filet of Beef\" (with \"olive oil crushed new potatoes, crisp parsnips, roasted cipollini onions, [and] red wine jus\"). The real winner (with both of us) of this course, though, was the crushed new potatoes. They were an interesting consistency -- not quite mashed, not quite diced -- which we both really liked.\n\nDESSERT: Again, we were both torn between the same two options, so we shared them equally. We ordered the \"Gingerbread Caramel Apple Sundae\" (with \"vanilla bean ice cream, Aspall cider caramel sauce, gingerbread, [and] roasted Sierra Beauty apples\") and the \"Sticky Toffee Pudding\" (with \"banana-date ice cream, candied kumquats, [and] eggnog creme anglaise\"). Both were wonderful, but the banana-date ice cream was a favorite for both of us, though we disagreed on the candied kumquats.
