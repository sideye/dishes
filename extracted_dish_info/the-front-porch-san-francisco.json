I'm just not feeling their food or their vibe.\n\nA few months ago, I had a piece of their fried chicken, fresh out of the fryer, and really enjoyed it.  It had perhaps a few too many herbs and such that weren't necessary, but the chicken was juicy and the batter was well-salted.  So, when we were looking for a brunch spot that offered chicken & waffles and biscuits & gravy, The Front Porch came to mind.\n\nI grew up in New Orleans, so I was excited to see some of my favorite foods on the menu - gumbo, red beans and rice, and even poboys using Gambino's French bread!  For two of us, we ordered biscuits and gravy, red beans and rice with sausage, and file gumbo as starters.  We then ordered chicken and waffles and a fried shrimp poboy as our main course.  A lot of food - way too much for two people - but I wanted to try it all.\n\nWe got the read beans and the gumbo very quickly...though it took us much longer, like halfway through our meal, to get water (we had to ask three times).  The red beans were awful.  Gummy and thick, sort of sweet and tomato-y....they tasted like old baked beans over rice.  The ratio of beans to rice was also way off.  There was much too much rice...  The gumbo was lukewarm and flavorless.  It needed a LOT more salt.  The meat was mealy and overcooked - plus, there was hardly any of it.  The okra was also overcooked and slimy.  I generally don't understand putting okra in a chicken/sausage gumbo...  The biscuits and gravy - arguably the fastest item to slap together - did not come out.\n\nNext, my poboy arrived - not with my boyfriend's meal as we had requested.  The bread would have been good if not stale.  There was little to no remoulade. The shrimp were fried using the same batter as the chicken, which has too many herbs that just aren't thematically appropriate.  Plus, the batter is too thick and overwhelming for shrimp.\n\nThe chicken and waffles came out next.  Still no biscuits and gravy...  The chicken was very disappointing relative to my first experience.  It had hardly any flavor.  The quality of the chicken was still good, but it was just so meh tasting.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy finally arrived - last.  They were TERRIBLE.  The Front Porch biscuits are actually scones.  They are so hard and dense, you nearly need a knife to cut through them.  They're basically the type of \"biscuits\" that colonial settlers used to carry with them on journeys from England to the \"New World\" because they were rock-like enough to stand up to seawater for months...  The gravy tasted awful.  It didn't have any sausage in it, it was very under-salted, and it had this weird acidic flavor.  We couldn't place it - but this was not biscuit gravy.\n\nAcross the board, everything was bland and under-seasoned.  To make matters worse, the service is scatterbrained and the restaurant is oppressively dark and gloomy.

In this case, however, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, since the other two members of my party besides my wife and me arrived quite late, and the hostess, who was absolutely delightful and accommodating, made sure we were well cared for.  My wife and I had the salt cod fritters, which were hot, delicious, soft, and moist, along with a large bottle of Duvel, the combination of which quickly eased our initial annoyance at the 45-minute wait to be seated (the hostess' estimate; our actual wait would have been shorter but for our friends' tardiness).  We were able to have our appetizer and beer on the patio, which allowed us to avoid having to crowd at the bar.\n\nThe Front Porch's other sin, revealed once we were seated, was that they had allowed a mariachi player to infest the restaurant.  Mariachi is my least favorite form of music on Earth, so not everyone may find this as much of a disadvantage.  Fortunately, he only played one or two songs, asked for money (which I might have given him in order to prevent him from playing), and then left before we started eating.\n\nMy wife and I split the bucket of chicken, which was enough not only for dinner but for subsequent lunches as well.

Another place that makes me feel like \"I don't get it.\" A feature in 7x7 several months ago, 2 Yelp ROTDs, and many more glowing Yelper reviews led me to believe that the Front Porch had reinvented fried chicken the way that XXX reinvented XXX (you can probably come up with something wittier than I can). Admittedly, the chicken wasn't BAD. The meat did have quite a punchy tang to it, though a little too much in my opinion, thus detracting from the joy of eating the crispy cornmeal (albeit overseasoned) crust/skin. It was also d-r-y, which to me is b-a-d. Moreover, I am a dark meat kind of gal and was very upset to find nary a succulent thigh in the paper bucket. $30 freakin' dollars for fried chicken and you can't give me any juicy thigh-action?!?! Eating fried chicken has never made me so sad!\n\nThe rest of the meal echoed my ambivalent sentiments of the chicken. \n- Cornbread served w/ honey chili butter: the cute ear of corn shape tricks you into liking these more than is warranted. A bit dry, but one of my friends liked them enough to get a second order - which we were not informed was an extra charge. :-/\n\n- Conch-Habanero fritters: I had to convince my gastronomically-conservative friends to try these out by telling them that \"it tastes like shrimp.\" Truth is that I totally forgot what they tasted like. If they taste like shrimp, I couldn't really tell because the spices that they use overpower any conch flavor. They were a little chewy, which suggests being overdone. Accompanying aoli was pretty good though and cut into the too-intense flavor of the breading.\n\n- Jerk entree of the day was steak tips: isn't it customary to ask for how well you want steak done?  Well, we weren't asked. Luckily it came out medium done, which was acceptable to me. The potato salad served with the dish did not seem to match up with the steak in flavor or texture; too bland and undercooked potatoes.\n\n- Sides: \n1) Fries Three Ways (home, sweet, and french): the concept induces more excitement than actually eating them. Though it was kind of fun to try and guess which was the sweet. Maybe we got a bad batch - oily and limp. Sad fries! Must say that their homemade ketchup and mayo that comes with the fries were excellent.\n2) Sauteed greens: first off, we thought we had ordered the black-eyed peas with collard greens, not the sauteed mustard greens. Oh well, we ate them anyway. Bitter, as expected, and nothing special about the flavor.\n3) Coconut red beans and rice: yum. Definitely a departure from traditional red beans and rice, lighter even with the use of coconut milk. This saved my tongue from falling off when I made the mistake of using the habanero (I think, it was yellow) hot-sauce on my chicken...holy crap, I almost asked for a glass of milk. Be warned!\n\n- Libations: an  interesting, extensive drink menu. Happy that there was $3.50 Pacifico. And get this...they serve malt liquor. Some Yelpers will appreciate this more than I can.\n\nIt might sound like I didn't enjoy my meal, but that's not really the case. Perhaps that is the danger in doing too much research before eating somewhere...there is a much greater chance of disappointment. Foodwise, yeah it was a'ight. Quite a pricy meal for what I considered 3 star tastiness. In my opinion, what makes the Front Porch a destination location is more for the atmosphere of refined Southern comfort. From the wooden porch and rocking chairs out front to the comfortable booths to the gorgeous tin roof to the charming, ethereal waitstaff, I felt like I was in another city - one smaller, homier, friendlier than San Francisco.

I've walked by this restaurant about 400 times and have heard people rave about the bread pudding, so I was anxious to compare it to what I've had around the South in the past. Unfortunately, it fell flat. The yam ice cream from Mitchell's (across the street) was a nice touch, but it came in a small casserole bowl that was warm on the outside, but not all the way through. Plus, it came out so fast that it seemed like it was just sitting somewhere warming, ready to go.\n\nOn a positive note, I'll say that I really dig the beers they have available at this place ... from some Abita (Louisiana) beers on draft, to tall cans of Tecate, to tall bottles of red stripe (a rarity), and even King Cobra malt liquor ;-)\n\nOverall, the food was decent, but just not what I was hoping for.

We ordered the red bean and rice as a starter (although typically a side dish).  Prior to our order they brought out sweet potato chips and cornbread.  The corn bread was just OK and came out lukewarm so it was nothing special (one of the few things as everything else was far above expectation).\n\nThe red beans and rice (we chose with pork) was fantastic.  It was just a little spicy with a slight sweetness from coconut and the pork was tender.\n\nMy wife had the spicy crab and grits which was also wonderful.

By this time we knew what we wanted to eat, so we ordered as soon as we sat down.  During that time they brought out some great cornbread, this was the highlight of the night , with some jamming , honey butter with peppers.. man that was good.  After more waiting they brought out some fried okra to tiddy us over.. my lady liked it with the spicy ketchup. Ok 25 to 30 minutes later, they brought our sides... the macaroni pie, red beans and rice.  Hmm ok where is our main dishes, 7 minutes later the main dishes... isnt that bassackwards, at least give me the main stuff first.  The chicken was good, but not even the best ive ever had, like some have claimed, actually it wasnt very seasoned, same with the fish.  Good but not great or screaming (like the homies say).  The mac and red beans and rice were ok.. but not screaming.  I can say though they were prepared a lil different, the plantains were good.

While I believe I would still have given The Front Porch 5 stars if my friend didn't know the chef, her personal touch--which I believe she probably bestows on all customers in one way or another--made our experience all the more extraordinary.\n\nSo we sat down and got water right away.  The restaurant's got a great ambiance and I admired their shelves by the table with salt and pepper, candle and flower.  \"Real Cute,\" as my friend C-Diddy would say.  \n\nImmediately the chef, who is quite attractive--not that it matters, but she is, brought us fried okra with a great sauce.  It. Was. So. Good.  I am now an Okra fan because of Sarah!  She also brought over cocktails that had rose petals and champagne as main ingredients and those were wonderful as well.\n\nA little later we got cornbread, in the shape of corn on the cob, with sweet butter.  Also so good, and I for one, appreciate the details.  \n\nWe ordered an Heirloom Tomato Salad and it was plated beautifully and tasted even better.  I was eating the sauce after it was all gone.  Really simple, and really friggin good.\n\nBetween the three of us we got a bucket of chicken with sweet corn and black eyed peas and collared greens as our side with an additional side of coleslaw for Les, cause he's a fan.\n\nI    Have    Never   Had  Chicken   So   Delicious!  \n\nShe knows how to use that spice rack.  Seriously, genius with the spices.  The corn was the same deal and the black eyed peas were great too.\n\nWe didn't get dessert because it was halloween and we wanted to be home to give out candy, but they looked great too.  \n\nI will be back for sure!\n\nThanks for an awesome and UNIQUE meal.

This is around 840pm so it's a completely different atmosphere than the day time hours. \nBefore we were sat I didn't know we needed reservations (not required but recommended) because it gets crazy busy as told by the hostess and our waitress ( I'll put her name once I find it out). Anyway luckily for us they had open tables so we were sat right away, we had an option to sit at the table in the middle of the restaurant which is noisier or at the bar which is more intimate. We chose the table because we don't mind the noise.\nRight away I notice the service is on point! Everyone who works there, bartender, hostess, waitresses, manager, bus boy, etc all helped out. They were all very nice and made sure everyone was taken care of.  \nLiterally right when we sat down a man brought us complimentary mini corn bread which was delicious then seconds later our waitress brings our water which was in a cool glass bottle. \nOur waitress was super cool and friendly! She went over the menu with us and recommended her favorites. \nMy boyfriend ordered the burger with fries and a side of mac and cheese and I ordered the Dr Pepper braised shorts ribs with a side of mashed potatoes :) Everything was delicious! The mac and cheese was cheesy and saucy! \nOh and my drink I ordered was on another level I had the Midnight Sun-ll and one of the ingredients was butterfly flower infused rum!  It was interesting in a good way :) \nOverall my experience was 10/10! Thank you for everyone's great service  I can't wait to come back and try the spicy shrimp and grits!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["I had a burger with American cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.

Our reservation was for nine o'clock and while we were on time we ended up being plus one, upon arrival. Probably not a big deal, but this is a small place; only worth mentioning because it resulted in a lengthy wait outside (probably to the tune of 30-45 minutes). They tried to make it right, with a free app, and bringing us drinks; the app however was slightly different (boiled peanuts) drinks were basically okay, sans the wine, which had turned (tasting of vinegar). They promptly replaced the wine with an appropriate substitution that was on par. \n\nIn any event, we were eventually seated and this place was busy! I mentioned it was late but still it was loud (at this hour on a weekday I believe that's a testament to a well enjoyed restaurant). It is also a bit eclectic and bohemian but definitely in line with the City and what I've come to expect (in a good way). In any event let me close this portion by saying they were all very polite, eager to please, and happy to go the extra mile in homage to their customers. \n\nI ordered the spicy shrimp and grits. First bite, grits, buttery, decadent, perfect consistency, almost mashed potato like and oh so savory. It came with a sauce that was very complimentary and offered incredible layers of appeal. The spicy was absent but that is typical for me, that said the sausage offered significant flavor to the dish and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. They served a bread snack small muffin, as a warmup, but it was a little disjointed for me; not as sweet as cornbread and tasted of sourdough without that consistency. The spread offered with the bread was okay, but did little to enhance the flavor of the bread, or stand on its own. \n\nAs for our other diners and guests: our younger son had the Dr. Pepper ham, which I didn't taste, but those that did raved. Our elder son, had the burger (he was polite enough to accept it, he'd ordered the flank steak but it became confused somehow) he ate 3/4 of it and was done; he also ate three fries and was equally over the fries too. My wife is a lover of mac 'n cheese and yet most of it remained in her dish; she described it as simply a cheddar sauce and a lot dry. I'd have went with a creamier cheese; though I love cheddar, it doesn't typically make a great sauce as it gets grainy when melting. \n\nHey, we often joke I do better at ordering, so perhaps I should've ordered for my lovely wife. Overall, I was happy with the dining experience, but I think she had the lesser experience, as did the elder son. I'd still come back, especially were I local.\n\nOn a brief side note: we could've easily passed by this place and missed it so know the address or destination, but it's worth the trip.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-04-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Waited almost an hour for a salad and a burger.

Nope...the chicken was cooked to perfection...the coating was delicious, flavorful, crunchy skin, yet for me...just a bit too crunchy...but its purely a texture thing for me.

And the jalapeno aioli that came with the fried okra was good, not the fried okra though.  OK so let me start at the beginning.  \n\nWe show up on Sunday afternoon around 12:45.  I tell the host that we had 3 and he asked me in a semi-horrified manner if we had a reservation.  I told him no and he said \"Ok well I'll be able to get you in in about 20-30 minutes.  *looks around* actually probably sooner, is your whole party here?\"  (I was totally confused as to why he acted like I was inside for showing up with no reservation then said it would be 20 minutes, I digress) I told him yes and went out front to wait with my girlfriends.  About 30-40 minutes later I checked in with him and he looked at me like it had been 30 seconds and shrugged and said \"uhh Idunno maybe like 20 minutes or so?\" um. what?  20 minutes later my pregnant friend (hungry, uncomfortable, swollen feet, read: watch out) went in to ask again and he told her with a great deal of snide attitude that we were next and it would be a few minutes.  About 10 minutes later we were called in.  Note that everybody waiting for a table was extremely pissed off and were in the same boat as us, INCLUDING people who had made reservations.     \n\nWe sat down and you know that kind of server who comes over and doesn't introduce themselves and just like puts waters down and just kind of acts like you come in 3 times a day and no greeting is even necessary?  i don't know if I described that correctly but its not like a familiar friendly attitude its like an obnoxious lazy can't be bothered way too cool attitude.  So she does that.  I don't know her name but I think she had an English accent.  Hard to say since she barely talked to us.  She barely ever came to the table and when she did she rushed us and was not friendly.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was the worst one I have ever had, it just had a really strange flavor I can't even really describe what it was, it was bitter and just strange.  Later I got a Lovely Day cocktail and it was pretty gross too, really cheap gin and really abrasive other flavors, do not recommend.  My girlfriend ordered a lemonade and she had to add sugar to it at the table, I totally didn't think I would agree but I tasted it pre-sugar and it was just lemon water (and they charge $3.50 each with no refills, really steep for lemon water).  \n\nThe fried okra tasted like it used those breadcrumbs from a canister and a lot of seasoning packet.  The jalape\u00f1o aioli was awesome and I'd eat a shoe dipped in that.  If I were to go again I would get an order of fries and a side of that aioli and call it a day.  The chicken and waffles was gross- the chicken was overly salty and I assume it is brined and whatever was in the brine just made the meat taste really strange, again I'm sorry that is not descriptive, it was just weird.  The worst part was the waffle, it was soggy and had gross chewy pieces of bacon studded in it just creating more saltiness.  It was a quite small portion and I hardly finished half.  Oh and its $18!! Where do these people get off?!?!?! The prices are INSANE!!! $50 per person for brunch.  \n\nMy friend got the shrimp and grits and it was OFF THE HOOK,  I only had one bite and maybe I was extremely hungry and disappointed by my own food but my memory is that it was awesome.  Recommend.  BUT, then again, shrimp and grits is sorta hard to fuck up.  Well maybe its not hard to fuck up but its also easy to get right.  \n\nThe server never came by to see how we were or ask if we wanted anything else, which we did, we wanted more cocktails the whole time.  She finally came by and put the check on the table and I had to ask if we could add to it and get more drinks.  Find a new line of work lady.  \n\nIf you want mediocre at best food, a rude host who is either lying to keep business or is just also really bad at his job, overpriced bad drinks using cheap well liquor all served to you by a person who is bothered by you and took cool for serving tables, come to Front Porch.

However with so much hype to the place it really made it difficult for me to have my own true opinion. With that said...lets start this review. It's a Saturday afternoon on a busy pride weekend. We have had a lot to drink and are now hungry and realize hey we're close to the front porch let's call and see if we could maybeeee get in. Luckily it wasn't so busy yet because it was early, they said sure come in we'll get you seated right away and sure enough we showed up 30 mins later and were seated at the bar. We gander the menu and make a couple of decisions. I ordered a bourbon ginger beer and my partner got a water. The drink was made stiff-perfect. Now on to the food. I ordered the 4 piece fried chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes. My wifey got a hamburger with their own homemade American cheese, now normally I'd be like Hunnie...American cheese? Lol but she seemed pretty dead set on that decision so we went with it. My food came out on a tray with a line of popcorn on the side. I would've throughly enjoyed that but I have braces so I had to refrain, a bit odd to be there but I think my wife thought they were good. The collard greens were not my favorite, they weren't chopped up like I'm used to and they simply tasted a little funny to me. The mashed potatoes came with a scoop full of gravy which always pleases me so brownie points there and the friend chicken was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside which was great. BUT the big winner for us was the hamburger. The fries were just ok as they seemed to be a bit soggy but the hamburger itself was on a semi sweet soft bun and it was juicy, but what made it really special was that darn cheese! My goodness!

Decided to make a group thing out of it and had 2 other couples come with us in August 2012. We were highly anticipating it because the menu looked really good and we love Cajun/Creole food. I also previously worked at a Creole restaurant for a year as a cook and fell in love with the cuisine.\n\nWe arrived and the place was tiny, which is ok but we had 2 babies with us so it was a little awkward on placing the strollers and our seats without being in the way. Also one of the couples was a bit late, and so when they did show up the server seemed to be rushing us a bit to order. We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, Hushpuppies and Fried Pickles. The Hushpuppies were good but I did not taste the supposed pork that was in it. They make their own BBQ sauce so that was cool but I didn't really care for it. The sauce that came with the pickles was awesome and who doesn't like Fried Pickles? :) I didn't have the Oysters because I don't like them, I think everyone enjoyed them but it was not something memorable. \n\nI also ordered a bowl of the Gumbo and I really did not like it, it was bland...just lacking flavor. 3 of us shared a bucket of Fried Chicken, which was fantastic, really moist and good flavor. The potatoes were good too but the collard greens were not so good, it seemed like they weren't seasoned or whatever they were seasoned with did not compliment it's flavor. One ordered the Shrimp and Grits dish and said it was really good and the other 2 ordered the Holy Shit Burger which they thought was AWESOME! \n\nMe and one other person finished with Bread pudding, that was good but again not really memorable. \n\nWhat we do remember however, is that one ordered coffee and the cream they brought with the coffee was lumpy and curdled...It is pretty normal for restaurants to pre pour cream into whatever they serve it to the table the day of service so that it is ready to go and saves time, but because this one was bad and there was a ring around the inside of the container, it told us that this cream had been sitting in the container for QUITE SOME TIME and no one was checking them to make sure if they were still good before serving to customers.

Although, the dish was so rich I probably would never be able to eat a whole order by myself. The biscuits are SO GOOD. And the Rosemary butter they come with is crazy delicious too. I literally would only give my bf one bite of them bc they were so good! The fried chicken was good but I'm not really a fried chicken person so I'd probably stick with the burger next time. My bf loved the greens they came with and he ate all of the mashed potatoes. The Mac and cheese was also good, but very cheesy and not too many noodles. Not the best I've ever had but still good. We ordered deep fried bacon on it too, but I ended up peeling off the fried portion to put some normal bacon on my Mac and cheese - deep fried was just too much.,Was seated fast and the staff was so nice!

It's so in and new to look so old. My favorite part of the atmosphere? All the facial hair in that place! Man, the side burns and handlebar mustachios on the guys that were in that restaurant were off the chart! \n\n+ Cornbread (complimentary)\nIt's in the shape of corn on the cob!!!

The shrimp was cooked well, and the grits was creamy and well done but all of it was ruined under a 1/4\" layer of red grease. I thought, maybe I'm not fancy or southern enough to appreciate this dish but I had everyone else at the table try it and everyone was awkwardly silent afterward (as in, no oohs and ahhs) until Marc was basically like \"dude, that's gross and greasy\".

Soggy sweet potato fries. :(\n\n- Fried oyster salad $?\nSomeone ordered this and it was so gross. The tangy dressing did not match the oyster and the oysters tainted everything in that dish with its hotness and oiliness, leaving anything fresh in its path in a wilted, oily, lukewarm mess.\n\n+ Fried chicken $16.75 for a couple pieces or $33.33 for 9 pcs\nThe batter was greasy, yet coarsely crunchy without any tasty spices. BUT the actual chicken meat was awesomely moist. The meat must have been rubbed (under the skin) with crushed processed/canned garlic because it had that fragrant bite of garlic yet a little duller than the fresh stuff. I liked it.

I found it on yelp and it was open until 10 and close and off we went.  Parking isn't bad and the neighborhood is very nice.  The front porch of the front porch provides a great walking up experience.  The inside is a surprise it looks kinda seedy bar but instead of seedy it's trendy and decorated very intriguing in a good way.  The seating is great, we got a table that had half van seats which was very comfortable and we loved the use.  Coming from the south I have a pretty high standard for most comfort southern food and fried okra seems to be one that fails constantly when I try these type restaurants.  Well, we got the okra for an app and it was great.  I've had better but not much better.  The rest of the meal just kept giving.  I got the fried chicken which came with mashed potatoes and collard greens.  The greens were cooked perfectly which means they were tender yet had just the right amount of texture left, not mushy. The potatoes were great. The chicken was, like some other reviews state, probably the best I've had in SF.  I ordered a side of molasses coated brussel sprouts simply because I just had to try them.  They were some of the best sprouts I've had and even though the portion was huge we finished them because they were so good.  He got a burger and other than mistakenly ordering it more done than he wanted it was great as well.  Another thing that was good for me was the cask beer.

Although I had a good time there and thought that the prices were very reasonable, I can't say that I was blown away by the food. In fact, some of the dishes didn't work at all, whereas others were more successful. The bomb of the night was appetizer, I believe it was called something along the lines of southern greens with tomatoes and ricotta fritters. A fritter should be light, airy puffs of fried batter and hopefully include some kind of goody inside. The consensus at our table was that our fritters were ill conceived and leaden. They were dusted with powdered sugar which not only didn't complement the savory tomato sauce they sat in but actually clashed with it. Blah. \n\nMoving on, I will say that they have cheap booze which can be a blessing if you want to go out and have one of those nights. My \"deuce\" of Three Thieves pinot was easy drinking and $10, which was fine with me. \n\nWe opted to order the fried chicken plate, the burger, and an order of crab grits with the idea that we would share everything.

You can't get ribs unless you get it with the wings in the appetizer. The fried chicken is just okay. Lots of seasoning. The skin comes off the meat way too easily. The accompanying slaw doesn't really taste like much. The burger has good meat, but the patty is just disgustingly thick. The fries were good. Pretty crispy for steak fries. The street corn was good.

We had a big party of 10, so we had reservations. We were seated in this corner booth with additional chairs. It was kinda tight, but we made it work.\n\nPARKING: Only street parking (mostly metered). There is one residential street where parking is free for 2 hours - but you gotta get lucky!\n\nFOOD: Think Southern style brunch food. Appetizers were great too! Biscuits & gravy and the FRIED OKRA with jalapeno aioli. Yum! \n\nTheir fried chicken is probably the most popular (takes 25 mins approx.). If you know you want it, order it fast so you don't have to wait long for it. Comes with huge pieces of chicken and a bacon waffle.\n\nI ordered the benedict with andouille sausage - yum! Served with choice of cheese grits or tater tots (got the grits, but it was sooo much. Probably should've gotten the tots).\n\nOverheard the coffee wasn't all that great - with some kind of spice to it?\n\nSERVICE & AMBIANCE: Mood lighting and pretty dark in there. Don't count on getting a good picture of your food in the dark - just enjoy it!

A local friend recommended this place for great fried chicken. I'm actually not huge on fried chicken, but decided to give this place a try.\n\nThis place is pretty popular and crazy and I was lucky to grab the last reservation spot. \n\nWhen you get there, they give you a plate of corn bread with herb butter. They were good and so moist.  My friends and I were a little too excited so we ordered everything on the menu.\n\nFor apps, we got the fried okra with jalapeno aioli, bacon-wrapped dates, and an arugula salad.\n\n- Okra: These were pretty good. I liked the fried batter. The aioli was a bit mild for me but I like things spicy\n- Dates: OH these melted in your mouth! AMAZING! Even my friend who doesn't care about dates really enjoyed these\n- Arugula Salad: nice refreshing salad but nothing special\n- Biscuits: I had to get a side of biscuits but I was expecting it to be drenched in gravy. But I was happy with the jam and herb butter :)\n\nFor the main entrees, we got:\n\n- Spicy Shrimp and Grits: This was delicious and I wish I could have more now! The grits were so smooth and creamy. The andouille sausage had a good kick of spice and were tasty. The shrimp was cooked perfect!\n- Dr. Pepper Braised Short Ribs: These were good and I would say worth to try but I probably wouldn't order it again. It was a super rich dish, which is expected in southern cooking. This was my fiance's entree, but he seemed to enjoy eating my spicy shrimp and grits dish more ;)\n- Fried Chicken Plate: We thought it was amusing that this was served on a lunch cafeteria tray instead of a nice white plate like the other dishes. I tried a piece of the fried chicken and the batter was tasty and light surprisingly (it wasn't oily at all). The chicken was also super flavorful and moist. \n- Flounder: I'm not sure how this was but my friend seemed to enjoy it\n\nWe had to finish our meal with some good ole desserts. We ordered the brown bag beignets and the pumpkin brioche bread pudding. Brown bag beignets were good but not memorable. The bread pudding was delicious but it was alot more dense than I was expecting.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-11-24"}, {"excerpts": ["- Fried Okra with Jalapeno Aioli ($7.50): ", "I loved the contrast in texture between the fried breading and the squishy okra.

The decor is absolutely adorable and homey, with rocking horses, a diverse array of potted plants, and small windows with curtains. This is the type of restaurant that belongs in a movie where the characters go on a perfect first date.\n\n- Fried Okra with Jalapeno Aioli ($7.50): I loved the contrast in texture between the fried breading and the squishy okra. The jalapeno aioli is not too spicy, and really gives a good kick of flavor.\n\n- Biscuits ($4.50/2 biscuits): These come with preserves and sage butter. Nothing special; I guess KFC has ruined my biscuit standards.\n\n- Baked Mac & Cheese ($8): I liked the shell-shaped pasta they used as the mac, and the cheese is not too overpowering. I did find this a bit undercooked.\n\n- Apple + Spice Brined Pork Chop ($21): I appreciate a good savory and sweet combination, and I'm really impressed by how much the apple flavor comes out in the meat. The homemade cranberry mustard on top of the pork chop is actually amazing (I don't like mustard, especially the grainy stuff, and I never choose to put it on my food). The bed of brussel sprouts and cornbread continued the savory and sweet trend.\n\n- Mulled Wine ($8): Those small moments of London always make my heart break. The wine is heavy on the spices and lower on the sweet factor than what I was expecting, but this is probably the most similar I've had in the states.\n\nAll dishes come with a mini cornbread with sage butter. They also give you their two spice sauces (the lighter bottle is more spicy), which you can buy by the bottle for $6 or 8. The place was quite crowded on a Saturday night at 7:30PM, so make a reservation if possible.\n\nStare fondly at the rocking horses.
