Now, I'm all grad-u-m-educated and no longer forced to follow the draconian schedule of academia.  My schedule is now the ho-hum dull-drums of 9ish-to-5ish.  With exceptionally less pay.  I have to do something about that.\n\nToday I met up with a friend who went to the same school.  We have this once-every-two-week event where we meet up for some opulent-to-us Happy Hour bites, and then we go try on shoes.  There's no harm in just trying them on.  And with shoes, it's ok to eat dinner first and not feel fat.  \n\nI got here around 6pm after trying on a massive failure of a skirt at Forever 21.  From that experience, I learned that I am no-longer-21.  AT ALL.  Especially around the waist area.  The bar was starting to fill up.  There were still a few seats at the counter but the majority of the bar tables were filled with happy people imbibing inexpensive libations whilst the sky opened up the heavens and poured.  It was really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  I could hardly hear my friend.  But the ambiance was really hip and happy.  There was not a grumpy drunk among the crowd.  \n\nMy signature drink now is the Virgin Mary.  Yes.  No alcohol.  It's like spicy tomato soup, except cold and tart from the lime juice.  My tongue is salivating just thinking about this drink.  A Virgin Mary costs $3.75.  The bartender made it spicy, just the way I like it.  And there were 2 olives AND a pickled onion!  I love pickled things.  \n\nWe ordered the crab cakes, garlic fries, mussels w/fries, bruschetta and ceasar salad.  \n\nThe crab cakes looked and tasted like they had not changed since the last time I had them about 2 years ago.  Sized between a golf ball and a tennis ball, these crab cakes had a uniform consistency throughout.  This means there was no lump crab.  Too bad.  I make the best crab cakes.  \n\nThe garlic fries were a very decent sized portion.  About the same volume as \"large\" size fries at McDonalds.  There was some fresh garlic crushed on top.  It could have been more flavorful.  I read somewhere that these used to be garlic-parm-fries.  The parm would have been a much welcomed addition.  \n\nMussels w/fries was a paltry serving!  for $8, there were 8 mussels in a small soup bowl on top of a kid-serving of fries.  Not worth it.  The broth was decent but not drink-with-a-spoon fantastic.  The mussels at Nordstrom Bistro is much better.  \n\nBruschetta: the burrata was amazing.  Burrata is the new mozzarella now.  Everyone and their mom's uncle has burrata on the menu.  It was delicious here.  The reduced balsamic drizzle was much too sweet to be taken seriously.  It tasted like it belonged on top of ice cream.  And the stewed tomatoes are a major NO.  I will not order this again.\n\nCeasar salad: also a skimpy serving.  It was about a cup of romaine served on a bread plate.  It used to be much bigger.  How much can salad cost?  It's just lettuce.  And 4 croutons.  NO ANCHOVY FILET.  I feel cheated.  This was not worth ordering.\n\nNext time I want to try the fritto misto.  And I really wish that they would bring back the fried mozzarella balls.  I love me some hot salty balls.  Please please please bring back the fried mozzarella balls.  \n\nIn conclusion: festive, jolly atmosphere.  Very loud so don't try to carry on a conversation.  Delicious Virgin Mary.

Our meal was something that would be served on Nightmare Kitchens. We had a really terrible experience. I found out only after that this is a restaurant associated with a hotel, so take that as you will.\n\n-- Service --\nOur waiter was really rude from the beginning. I know every one has a shitty day, but his attitude was more than that. The restaurant was basically empty and service was terrible. Our waiter was usually no where to be found. It took a *really* long time to get our plates cleared and to get the check. \n\n-- Drinks --\nSO ordered whiskey on the rocks, which tasted watered down.\n\n-- Food --\nWe started with olives, which weren't great, but weren't that bad. The serving of olives was quite large though compared to other Italian restaurants so that was nice. SO had calamari and enjoyed it. We were brought what looked like focaccia and a questionable and oily sauce.\n\nLooking now, entrees on the Yelp menu have half-size prices available, but on the restaurant menu, these were not available. Full size portions are really large. I had the Capellini which is described as \"Plum tomatoes, garlic, basil, marinated fresh mozzarella.\" SO had the Linguini and Clams which is described as \"Littleneck clams, Calabrian chili butter, garlic, tomato, white wine, parsley, crostini.\" \n\nI've had meals where the food wasn't really great, but never inedible.

The mozzarella was covered in oil and not soft. It took effort to cut through it. SO had a similar experience with the Linguini and Clams. The linguini was overcooked, covered in oil, and under seasoned. The clams were bland but not terrible.\n\n-- Price -- \nSO EXPENSIVE. I enjoy eating out, and this is not worth the money.

This is a deal, considering we've seen it sold for almost $14 a glass elsewhere.  We ordered the bruschetta, and I would not say it was my favorite.  The portion was a bit small, but the goat cheese and sauce were very flavorful. However, the bread and tapenade they serve when you sit down were outstanding!  I'd skip the bruschetta next time and just order more of that awesome bread.  \n\nThe spaghetti and meatballs were really savory. Not the typical red sauce you'd expect to find in an Italian restaurant.  Heavier on the meat, less on the tomatoes.  Delicious, and the portion size was generous.   There was shaved parmesan cheese on top. Just enough for taste, and not over-powering. \n\nOur friends had the Frutti di mare, and raved about it.  I sampled one of the mussels and it was fresh and very tasty.  \n\nThe service was wonderful.  Attentive, and friendly.  We were surprised to notice later that our waiter was also the bartendar.

I called the day of the reservation and asked if she could give us a call if they could fit us in earlier.  I was told by the hostess that their \"policy doesn't work like that.\"  Fair enough...well, imagine my dismay and irritation when we walk in at 8:30 expecting a full restaurant and saw at least 3 tables that could had seat five open in a half empty restaurant.  Our experience only went downhill from there.\n\nAtmosphere: \n The reason I keep choosing this restaurant is because I really like its atmosphere.  It's dimly lit with cozy booths and tables.  \n\nService:  \nI waited tables for 11 years of my life and can confirm that our waiter was a jerk.  Things he did I thought were rude:  Upon asking if we could have 3 separate checks, he answered \"If I'm not too busy.\"  Seriously, guy?  Either yes or no would have been sufficed.  While taking our order he cut one of our friends off in the middle of an order, and just walked away.  We had to hunt him down to give the rest of her order.  We got the wrong salad.  No apologies were made.  Gratuity was put on a party of 5.  Perhaps because he usually gets crappy tips because he's a crappy waiter?  \n\nFood:  \nComplimentary focaccia bread with olive tapenade: Good, but the bread was cold and slightly stale.\n\nChicken Marsala:  Our friend seemed to like it.\n\nLasagna with sausage:  A carnivorous male actually said there was way too much meat in the lasagna.  Where he was tired of tasting just meat.\n\nFig pizza without bacon:  Our friend enjoyed it.\n\nBeet Salad:  Very very good, with golden and red beets.\n\nMargherita Pizza:  Maybe we're spoiled with the pizza we usually get, but the dough was like cardboard.  Charred cardboard.  Bf stated it tasted worse than frozen grocery store pizza.  The cheese just tasted like bland goop.  There were about 3 ribbons of basil on the pizza.  It was like a cheap $5 frozen cheese pizza.  Ew.\n\nRisotto:  It was supposed to be butternut squash, pureed cauliflower, and arugula.  It tasted like under cooked rice a roni with hard bits of squash.  It was gross.\n\nOverall:  I was displeased with the bad service we got here, and most of the food was so poor in quality, taste, and preparation that I can't justify ever coming back.
