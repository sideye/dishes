I found myself just picking it out of the sandwich. =/ The slaw gave a nice crunch, however, it lacked acid to cut through the richness of the meats. The highlight was the liver (5 stars) which was decadently rich and creamy (no metallic taste). I'm glad they sell this a la carte because it would make a killer spread over some lightly toasted Acme or Josey Baker bread.  Mmmm....\n\nThe sandwich also came with a pickle spear which was perfectly pickled, uber crunchy, and very satisfying. For the price of the sandwich, I wish it came with two spears but anyhow, I would definitely come back for a jar.\n\nA NYC classic, it's rare to find egg creams in SF so I ordered a Vanilla Egg Cream ($3.50) to slurp on while I waited for my sandwich to be made. Loved the prominent vanilla flavor but it was too sweet for my liking. Next time, I would ask for less syrup. \n\nService was very friendly and sandwiches took about 8 minutes to be made (only 1 person working).\n\nEasy street parking. \n\nThe sandwich, egg cream, and small tip totaled over $18...for a non-sit down lunch.

At Paulie's I tried a \"Not from a Can\" tuna sandwich, lentil salad, potato salad, barley salad, and a cherry mint drink.  The sandwich was a spin on classic tuna salad - with relish, celery, lemon and mayo and topped with lettuce and pickled onions on a roll (I had poppyseed, it was delish).  It didn't look that big, but I could only eat half (and I was hungry).  I *loved* the lentil salad (made with pickled carrots, maybe cinnamon?) and potato salad (made with lots of dill and pickled green bean pieces, no mayo).  The barley salad was a little strong for my taste, with feta and sundried tomato strips, but I think that was just a personal preference (and btw, I ate it all anyway).  I think a whole sandwich which comes with a side salad was $7, so pretty reasonable considering the quality.\n\nPaulie's shares its space with 5 (?) other vendors, so it's almost like going to a permanent farmers market - other vendors have sushi, organic produce, cutlery, vegan baked goods (this is Bernal after all), and yummy-looking empanadas.
