The servers were nice, and the guy server looked like Final Fantasy. A table was immediately available on this particular Tuesday evening just after 10 pm. Aside from the servers, I was the only Asian. Aside from the servers + the cooks, I was the only non-white person. This doesn't matter to me - I only mention it because I know some people look at these restaurants through a \"how many Asians are there?\" scope. For the record: one.\n\nThe pair of white girls sitting two tables down from me were of the university varsity pullover hoodie variety. I wasn't paying attention to their conversation or their food, but I did take notice when one of them sent a crab (sashimi? roll?) dish back because \"It isn't fresh - it's very bad.\" She opted to just go without food instead of getting a replacement, but she eventually got a plate of something other than crab.\n\nI ordered the $18.95 \"dinner box\", which lets you choose 2 from among 21 items and comes with rice, salad, and miso soup. I chose chicken katsu and calamari katsu, and they were each served with a different condiment. I'd say the dish was... alright. The chicken was on par with McNuggets. The calamari had an unexpected look and feel. There's a texture you'd expect, then there's a \"is this really from the sea?\" texture, which was what I got. Sizewise, it didn't feel like an $18.95 load of food.\n\nI also ordered uni (sea urchin), and a funny thing happened with it. They only had one left, which I received. My server said I'd be charged half since the price was for 2 pieces. A minute or two later, they said I simply wouldn't be charged at all. I didn't know if the prior crab incident had set up a chain reaction of apologetic behavior or if this was just how they did things. In the old days, failure would've meant slicing oneself open then being beheaded. Perhaps this modern rendition was decapitating the price.\n\nSomehow, I can still picture myself here in the future. On most days, it's open an extra hour beyond other places in the area. The service was on-point, but the dishes were each lacking in one way or another.

At regular prices, you're knocking on $50+, and by that time you should just walk the couple blocks over to Amasia Hide's, where the sushi will cost about the same but be of much higher quality and the seaweed salad is superior by far.\n\nBe sure to check the signs around the walls and the specials list. The menu seems to lack some of the typical non-sushi Japanese stuff, but some of these wall signs let you know that you can get some of them (I saw a sign for tonkatsu, for example). Also, there's a sauteed mushroom appetizer that is just fantastic. I didn't notice it on the menu yesterday, but if it's still there it's really worth adding to your order.

I haven't yet met a piece of sushi I didn't like, but finding originality in a commodity like fish in a place like SF can sometimes be challenging.  Case in point: on the whole, Osaka is a really cute little place, but fairly unremarkable.  And yet, there are a couple special touches that bring it up from a, \"Hm.  Well, I'm glad I tried that.\" to a \"Like muchly, would eat again.\"\n\nOsaka, in true San Franciscan restaurant style, is a small, rectangular space.  Running along one side is the sushi bar, and along the other are several tables, chairs, and bench seats run along the wall.  The atmosphere is very casual, and I remember being seated across from the requisite marker board telling me the day's specials in neat handwriting.\n\nI was lucky enough to be there with some friends at happy hour, where the deals were really quite good and where we were presesnted with a small menu of appetizer-like tasties, each for around $5 or less.  The regular prices were quite a bit more expensive, but the special rolls are large, and the quality is very good.\n\nThere were two dishes that really bumped Osaka up to a place of legitness in my mind.  The first was the Chirashi.  It's expensive, but if you're not super hungry it's actually enough for two.  It was this dish that introduced me to the glory of butterfish.  I don't know if it's all butterfish, or just the stuff they serve at Osaka but Oh.  Mygod.  I have never met an edible that was more aptly named.  All the other fishies were fresh and clean and served over rice that was gloriously sticky and sweet.  The other dish that I would really recommend is the Spicy Crispy Roll.  As someone who tries to be health-conscious, I don't really do the fried roll thing very often.  So I was a little dismayed to see so many \"crispy\" offerings.  However, the salmon was fried so perfectly, and that plus the avocado and tobiko (different colors for each piece!) made for a truly extravagant treat.\n\nIn a city veritably swimming with tasty raw fish bits, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to go to Osaka.

I haven't yet met a piece of sushi I didn't like, but finding originality in a commodity like fish in a place like SF can sometimes be challenging.  Case in point: on the whole, Osaka is a really cute little place, but fairly unremarkable.  And yet, there are a couple special touches that bring it up from a, \"Hm.  Well, I'm glad I tried that.\" to a \"Like muchly, would eat again.\"\n\nOsaka, in true San Franciscan restaurant style, is a small, rectangular space.  Running along one side is the sushi bar, and along the other are several tables, chairs, and bench seats run along the wall.  The atmosphere is very casual, and I remember being seated across from the requisite marker board telling me the day's specials in neat handwriting.\n\nI was lucky enough to be there with some friends at happy hour, where the deals were really quite good and where we were presesnted with a small menu of appetizer-like tasties, each for around $5 or less.  The regular prices were quite a bit more expensive, but the special rolls are large, and the quality is very good.\n\nThere were two dishes that really bumped Osaka up to a place of legitness in my mind.  The first was the Chirashi.  It's expensive, but if you're not super hungry it's actually enough for two.  It was this dish that introduced me to the glory of butterfish.  I don't know if it's all butterfish, or just the stuff they serve at Osaka but Oh.  Mygod.  I have never met an edible that was more aptly named.  All the other fishies were fresh and clean and served over rice that was gloriously sticky and sweet.  The other dish that I would really recommend is the Spicy Crispy Roll.  As someone who tries to be health-conscious, I don't really do the fried roll thing very often.  So I was a little dismayed to see so many \"crispy\" offerings.  However, the salmon was fried so perfectly, and that plus the avocado and tobiko (different colors for each piece!) made for a truly extravagant treat.\n\nIn a city veritably swimming with tasty raw fish bits, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to go to Osaka.

Lot's of table top seating for  your convenience. The spacing between the tables were a bit small but I managed to fit into the booths. The light colored wood accents and walls, along with the Japanese style plants and decor made for a very authentic Japanese vibe. The service was awesome! She was super nice and accommodating. My friend asked about a potential iPhone charger and she was nice enough to get one for the table. Super appreciative of that. For dinner, here's what I got:\n\n-Kamikaze roll for $5. Yellowtail, Hamachi, with green onions in a roll. It was alright. A nice piece of hamachi in the roll, the green onions weren't overpowering. Not jumping out of my see but for the price, I would get that again. \n\n-Miso ramen for $10.95. This miso ramen was filled with noodles, bamboo, seaweed, egg, pork, onions, and green onions. It was packed with toppings. Throughout the dish, I kept commenting on how many things were in here. Appreciated the amount of food. I thought there was a little too much onions in there and not enough noodles. The flavor was a little bland though, in my opinion. Other than the milky look to the broth, I couldn't really tell it's miso characteristic. Maybe more miso or more salt in the future. \n\nOverall, it was a good place. The food was filling and the service was great. I would definitely be back to check out other dishes and maybe another type of ramen next time.

But they have a broad men I occasionally explore with fear and trepidation -- because I discovered Japanese food late in life (though I've eaten Korean since the third grade). \n\nA little background to explain why Osaka's soba noodles blew me away. \n\nI've been on a 90% vegetarian streak for weeks now. The 10% so far revolves around ham and good quality steaks. I had some carnitas recently that tasted like a dead animal. Same with chicken. Weird, huh? But ham and sirloin are okay. \n\nBut tofu!!??!! Can't get enough plain chunks of it. Not formed in chikken patties or wok fried with sweet sauce. Just tofu. \n\nWell enough about tofu. \n\nSo yesterday the three engines I attend, which normally provide a continental breakfast (you know, donuts and coffee), a nutritious and filling lunch (salad and rice, I have always disliked wings), and a snackable pre-dinner (trail mix and peanut butter crackers) failed to deliver. \n\nAlthough I was on time for all but the last (where there was one pack of crackers left), the other participants had consumed everything else. \n\nAs in 8 people ate 24 donuts and a half gallon of half and half. As in twice the normal number of people were at the lunch. One person was dipping the last piece of bread into the grease left from the wings. Fingers had scooped any traces of hummous. There were smears of Caesar salad dressing to hint at what had once been there. \n\nI found half a banana and two nuggets of watermelon. I was sad. \n\nSo after my last meeting, I was weak and cranky. And my 90% vegetarian leanings made Castro food choices a bit off. Budget inadequate to Catch or Fable. Not craving calorie laden Thai. Not being willing to walk to Church Street for Warakubune. \n\nAnd I thought of Osaka. Bento sounded good. \n\nBut when I sat down, I saw a sign for \"Ten zaru 11.95\" which the sign described as cold soba noodles with tempura. \n\n\"Hmmm,\" I thought. \n\nI saw a few things in the menu that were possibilities -- tempura mushrooms, octopus tsunomomo and the like. But I wanted to ask the server about the Ten zaru. \"Dipping sauce? Daikon? Yes,  I understand the noodles will be cold. I'd also like some miso soup, please.\"\n\nWell -- yum. Yum yum. Yum yum yum. Cold noodles in savory broth balanced by Osaka's always good tempura.

The servers were nice, and the guy server looked like Final Fantasy. A table was immediately available on this particular Tuesday evening just after 10 pm. Aside from the servers, I was the only Asian. Aside from the servers + the cooks, I was the only non-white person. This doesn't matter to me - I only mention it because I know some people look at these restaurants through a \"how many Asians are there?\" scope. For the record: one.\n\nThe pair of white girls sitting two tables down from me were of the university varsity pullover hoodie variety. I wasn't paying attention to their conversation or their food, but I did take notice when one of them sent a crab (sashimi? roll?) dish back because \"It isn't fresh - it's very bad.\" She opted to just go without food instead of getting a replacement, but she eventually got a plate of something other than crab.\n\nI ordered the $18.95 \"dinner box\", which lets you choose 2 from among 21 items and comes with rice, salad, and miso soup.

My server said I'd be charged half since the price was for 2 pieces. A minute or two later, they said I simply wouldn't be charged at all. I didn't know if the prior crab incident had set up a chain reaction of apologetic behavior or if this was just how they did things. In the old days, failure would've meant slicing oneself open then being beheaded. Perhaps this modern rendition was decapitating the price.\n\nSomehow, I can still picture myself here in the future.

"], "author": "Nick C.", "review": "I was thinking to myself whether or not to rate this place 3 STARS or 3.5 STARS. As I continued to eat my meal, I decided to give it 3 STARS. The service is good. The decor is your typical Japanese everyday sort of thing. The food ranges from good to okay to \"meh, not coming here again but still edible\".\n\nI'm very picky when it comes to Japanese restaurants because I have eaten at a bunch of them, and love really good Japanese food. With that said, this place is decent but nothing to come back for or rave about.\n\nMe and my girlfriend ordered their Bento Lunch Box, Caterpillar Roll, and Grilled Oysters. For our Bento Lunch Box we decided on Spicy Tuna Roll + Chicken Karaage, and Ebi Tempura Roll + Chicken Teriyaki. \n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll was \"MEH, I've had a lot better...not coming back here for that.\" Their Chicken Karaage was pretty good, because it had a nice crunch to it but was not soaked in oil. Although I've had better, it was good. Their Ebi Tempura Roll was \"umm...no.\" As for their Chicken Teriyaki, when compared to Tani's Kitchen...it makes this place look like a chump. The flavor is lacking and the teriyaki sauce is more on the watery side.\n\nTheir Catepillar Roll was the best out of all the dishes we ordered. I would say this is a 4 STAR  sushi roll. The rice tasted fresh and had a good flavor. The sushi was tight and compact. And the portions of avocado, eel, and cucumber were on point. \n\nFinally, their Mussels were a let down. The flavor and ingredients they used was REALLY GOOD! It had like this sweet and spicy sauce with the fish eggs. Although it tasted good, they over cooked it to the point of it being REALLY TOUGH and CHEWY :(.\n\nI realize this might be the only Japanese place in the castro, but when compared to other places in SF and even in San Mateo, this place is a 3 STARS at best.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Their spicy tuna roll was probably one of the spiciest rolls I've had, and that's a good sign."], "author": "Gina I.", "review": "Happy Hour, that's all I can say.
