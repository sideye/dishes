"], "author": "David A.", "review": "You hear about other people stumbling upon a hidden gem of a wonderful restaurant, but my brother and sister in law finally found one on their own. They were raving about this place literally for weeks or months before they took me here for my birthday and admittedly I was skeptical \"yeah yeah it sounds great\" because usually when someone hypes something up too much whether it's a movie or a dining experience, it's almost always something of a letdown. \n\nBut not The Richmond though, they do not disappoint! I honestly can't think of anything I have been more impressed with in a very long time. Every single item on the menu that I tried was superb and five star caliber. The chef and owner who is very friendly and personable spends a lot of time at each table and makes you feel special; almost as if your table is the only one and your group are the only guests in the restaurant while there are other tables separated by curtains he is also attending to with personal care and attentiveness.  \n\nWhen my then 7 year old niece Lauren craved Apple Cider, he informed us that unfortunately they did not have apple cider, but get this! he sent one of his employees out to the store to buy a chilled bottle of Martinelli's sparking cider just for her. Now that is wonderful service! \n\nI rarely go into detail about the actual meal when writing about a restaurant on Yelp but I can vividly remember everything I had even though this was my birthday back on August 10th. First thing they served was warm sliced baguette with three different types of soft butter, one was regular butter, another one was Olive butter and the third was butter with herbs and chives, all three and the warm baguette pieces were delicious. they then brought a bowl of butternut squash soup, so good and so much better than that French onion soup they serve you at a lot of other places. The next thing was a huge scallop over braised sirloin and polenta; everything about that was done to perfection and I really wanted another one after finishing the first. seriously the tastiest scallop I ever had. \n\nMy duck with potatoes and vegetables was the best I ever ate! Even my dad who thinks that only Germans know how to make duck and goose right said his duck was excellent. I ordered the Peach Crisp which was seasonal and replaced the usual apple crisp but they surprised me with an 'on the house' complimentary birthday dessert before my peach crisp with vanilla ice cream even arrived. They brought me a panna- cotta .. (not sure why it's auto correcting \"panna cotta\" No I did not have Panda cotta! I gave up panda years ago), Seriously though, I never eat things like Veal or Foie gras or even caged eggs, but the food here is so good that I might have tried one of those if someone were offering me a sampling. I did try small potions of what others were having and everything here is delicious!  \n\nIf the food wasn't amazing enough, what has everyones mind blown is the more than reasonable price! Compared to a comparable place like Chapeau on Clement street which we have frequented for many many years; and the food here is far superior in my opinion, the bill is somewhere between 25-30% less expensive. Just incredible! For a party of six, (including my niece who had her own adult meal), appetizers, entrees, desserts, bread, several glasses of wine, beer etc was around $300 before gratuity. My friend Bryan who has also tried The Richmond based on the recommendation from my brother said \"Wow! that's the first time in my entire life that I have ever been sticker shocked in the opposite way\" Just an amazing value.\n\nIf I can find anything to complain about, it's very difficult to find a parking space around here and no valet parking service to my knowledge. The waitress took unusually long intervals of time before noticing us when needing something from her and it was difficult to flag her down but if that's the only complaint I can even think of, this restaurant still deserves all five stars and more.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The chef had given us some complimentaries with our meals including the Beets and carrots salad and the butternut squash soup.

When I placed my reservation I had explained that I had food allergies (seafood/shellfish), but still wanted to proceed with the 5 course tasting menu, which did include salmon and scallops. Upon arrival, John Ha, the head chef/owner greeted us at our table personally and explained to me that he have made a custom modification to my part of the menu to accommodate me and my needs. He was very pleasant to talk to and was extremely respectful. In fact, throughout the night we saw him entering and exiting the kitchen greeting all of his other guests in the same manner we were received. \n\nThe food? Very contemporary and very very delicious. There was a balance to every dish and everything was simply perfect. In fact, we were presented with more than the 5 course meal we had expected.

"], "author": "Diane B.", "review": "I knew we were meant to eat there when we FOUND A PARKING PLACE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET!  Sorry, I just had to yell it.  We came in to this tiny spot for a 6:30 reservation and only one other two top was seated.  Shortly after we arrived that couple seemed to have some sort of tiff regarding vegetarian items and the woman patron stomped out, leaving her embarrassed dinner companion to eat his giant hamburger by himself.\n\nThe owner, his wife and niece all provided service.  We chatted and introduced ourselves.  I kept wondering how the food was getting cooked since John (owner/chef) presented almost every dish and poured every glass of wine.  It was a lovely touch, though, and made us feel pampered.\n\nWe got the Chef's tasting menu and the wine pairing, both incredibly values at $50 for the food and just $25 for the wine (3 oz pours, but they warn you and that's enough when having 5 glasses).  John brought us one extra glass of chenin blanc when we sat down so we wouldn't be sitting there with nothing to drink/eat while we awaited the start of the meal.  Very nice touch:\n\nAmuse bouche 4.5: \nthe cutest little ham and cheese sammy ever -  a tiny piece of brie wrapped in thinly sliced ham in between two pieces of puff pastry.  It was about one inch square, no more, and would have been perfect if the cheese were just a tad softer/warmer.\n\nExtra course, just because he was trying out a new recipe 4: \n Butternut squash soup - let it be know, I am not a fan of any of those large baking squashes or pumpkin.  Despite that, this soup was very good, incredibly silky, gorgeous color, and the top off of earthy, crunchy, toasted pumpkin seeds went a long way to offset the sweetness of the gourd.\n\n Roasted Beets & Cardamom Carrot Salad topped with Laura Chenel goat cheese in phyllo pastry 4.5: \nWell my husband, who never eats beets liked them, and I, who am not terribly fond of goat cheese thought the little chevre purse was delightful.  The two of us, who mostly like our carrots raw, thought in this preparation with cardamom they were delicious\n\nSoftshell crab set on a spinach salad 4.5: \nThe menu called for a crab cake, but John said he had softshell crab and wondered if we'd like to try it.  Well he didn't have to ask twice, since we're both big fans.  These crab were perfectly cooked and tasted so fresh and wonderful.  He said he was still perfecting the recipe, but I think it was already there!  One small change I'd make is to leave out the pieces of hard cooked egg in the spinach salad.  They made it a little too rich; maybe better with the crab cake.\n\nWhisky Braised Oxtail & Maine Diver Scallop on creamy polenta 5:\nI've seen similar combos before, and frankly I think I'd prefer either one or the other.  The oxtail (it actually seemed more like a piece of short rib to me, but doesn't really matter) was deeply flavored and perfect texture - wonderfully tender, but not at all stringy.  The scallop was well cooked too, but a little overpowered by the rich meat sauces, and the polenta was creamy, but still had a little bit of texture - loved it\n\nBraised Duck Leg in a Port Wine Sauce 5:  I'm a big duck fan, especially the crispy skin.  Well this preparation was obviously not crispy, but left the duck meat with a silky and earthy. As my dear departed mom used to say, just ducky!\n\nPalate cleanser 3.5: raspberry granite with fresh strawberries- cleansed the palate, but had very little flavor.  Pretty color though\n\nCoffee ice cream, coffee granite, coffee cream, & almond brittle 4.5:  More elaborate than most semiffredo, liked the brittle.  This was a great way to end the meal.\n\nWe enjoyed ourselves immensely, but felt sorry for the poor deserted diner, who was standing out on the sidewalk when we left.  I guess his date took the car as well as spoiling the dinner.\n\nFood:  37/40\nService 20/20\nAtmosphere/Intangibles: 17/20\nValue: 20/20\noverall:94/100!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-06-02"}, {"excerpts": ["I started with the butternut squash soup.

I had two great glasses of wine for good measure.\n\nNow on to the food.\n\nThey start you off with a deviled egg. Interesting, but good.\n\nThen they give you bread with flavored butters. I wish I knew what kind of bread this was, because ohhh mama it was good.\n\nTo start I shared with my boyfriend the Harvest Salad (spicy pecans, candied cranberries & Forme D'Ambert with an apple cider vinaigrette) and the Whisky Braised Oxtail with a Maine Diver Scallop. Both were divine. The salad had just enough dressing and the polenta with the scallop was immensely scrumptious. We were almost fighting over the last morsels of the scallop dish.\n\nOn to the main dishes.\n\nThe boyfriend had the hanger steak. He was highly impressed when they served it they way he wanted it, medium rare. It wasn't bloody and it wasn't overcooked-at all. His comment was \"this is the best steak I've had in a long time.\" It also came with a crepe filled with pancetta, potato, onion fennel & Brie, which was so good. Thank goodness we share our meals.\n\nI had the Rack of Lamb with bacon, onion, cabbage, pave potatoes & yogurt sauce. The potion was good and the taste was heaven. I'm very picky about my lamb and when bit into the juicy meat, I was utterly impressed. The vegis were cooked but not overcooked and the potatoes with bacon...oh my. \n\nDid I mention dessert?\nWe had the panacotta with raspberry sauce.

I made the reservations on Open Table about a week and a half ago, and John called me the afternoon of to confirm our reservation and to ensure we were coming.  It could be because the restaurant is small, so they wanted to make sure we showed up and used the table, but I appreciated that he called. And he also congratulated us three times while I spoke with him on the phone.  We were seated immediately when we got there. \n\nWe started off with 2 glasses of sparkling wine. While waiting for the appetizers we got to sample the amuse bouche of potato leek soup (so good and creamy!) and the warm French bread with 3 flavored spreads. We got  2 appetizers: the whisky braised oxtail with Maine diver scallop and the Seared Artisan Foie Gras with pain perdu and pear sauce. As reported by the fellow yelpers, these 2 appetizers are divine! The foie gras pairs wonderful with the pain perdu (it's almost a bread putting/french bread texture) - a great pairing of sweet and savory. The creamy polenta was heavenly, and really went together well with the was melt- in-your-mouth scallops. Those dishes only could have been my meal (the replenish the french bread when you are running low, and the appetizers are good portion size).\n\nOur entrees: Seared Hanger Steak on a crispy \"brick dough\" crepe filled with pancetta, potato, onion fennel & Brie, and the wild pacific sea bass with veggies (sorry I forgot to take notes on the sea bass).

And they brought it out with a thoughtful little candle they gave us to celebrate our anniversary. We both made a wish before blowing it out. I had ordered a coffee and they had forgotten to bring it to me before handing us the check, so they took it back and took the coffee off the bill. \n\nJohn came over to each table to thank the customers for coming out and supporting their restaurants. He also congratulated us on our anniversary. I appreciated the time and effort he took to thank each of our tables.
