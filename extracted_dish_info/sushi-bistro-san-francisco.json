They brought us some green tea, with teabags in the cups, which made me wary because you only see that in non-Japanese-owned establishments.

Oh well, with almost 1,000 reviews and a four-star average, I had to trust in the system. \n\nFor three of us, we just kept the rolls coming. What was great was that we would order one or two at a time and when they were brought out, we would order another, but there were not huge lulls in between. They came out at just the right pace and our waiter/host was really nice, and then I learned he spoke Mandarin when he was talking to the table next to us, which kind of threw me for a loop. So we got the following:\n\n1) african spider   12.95 (NOT A FAN, THERE WAS SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THE SAUCE AND THE WAY IT WAS FRIED, PASS!)\nsoft shell crab, sprouts, tobiko, deep-fried cajun albacore and salmon topped with avocado, eel sauce, and spicy sauce.\n\n2) monster in-laws   12.95 (WAS SUGGESTED THIS OVER THE YT JALAPENO, AND IT WAS GOOD)\nchopped spicy albacore, cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce.\n\n3) rock'n roll   8.25 (ALTHOUGH NOT A ROLL, IT STILL CAME IN 8 PIECES AND WAS MY FAVORITE OF THE MEAL)\nbaked spicy scallops served on top of a California roll. \n\n4) 49er     8.95 (ALWAYS LOVE THE REFRESHING COMBINATION OF SALMON AND LEMON)\navocado and tobiko topped with salmon and lemon.\n\n5) aloha 101   9.95 (REALLY PRETTY PRESENTATION WITH THE SUSHI, MARRED BY WHAT DK CALLED LEFTOVER RAMEN SOUP BASE FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE.

PLAIN OL' WASABI AND SOY SAUCE WAS BETTER)\nahi tuna, mango & cucumber wrapped in seaweed, flash-fried, served with spicy garlic sauce.\n\n6) butterfish blasters   13.95 (ORDERED THESE BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. GOOD, BUT WOULD PROBABLY TRY SOMETHING NEW NEXT TIME, AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THIS AGAIN)\nsnow crab meat and avocado wrapped in butterfish torched with a garlic-soy\n\nI think we had one more order, but I can't remember what it is at this time.

I DID NOT LIKE THE SAUCE AND FELT THAT IT RUINED THE DISH WITH HOW IT LOOKED AND TASTED. PLAIN OL' WASABI AND SOY SAUCE WAS BETTER)\nahi tuna, mango & cucumber wrapped in seaweed, flash-fried, served with spicy garlic sauce.\n\n6) butterfish blasters   13.95 (ORDERED THESE BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. GOOD, BUT WOULD PROBABLY TRY SOMETHING NEW NEXT TIME, AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THIS AGAIN)\nsnow crab meat and avocado wrapped in butterfish torched with a garlic-soy\n\nI think we had one more order, but I can't remember what it is at this time.

(Because once a week is how often I would prefer to eat sushi :] but anyway...) Rolls range from about $8 - $14.

It is crab meat and avocado wrapped with butterfish. Made a unique and tasty combination that had great flavor and texture!\n\n2 - Original ML ($11.50): Very good and not even on the menu!!

I think if it would have let it cool I would have liked it better.\n\n5 -Hamache Kama (9.50): had yellowtail inside of it.\n\n6 - Monster in Laws (11.75) This one had some albacore, yellowtail, and even jalapeno in it. \n\n7 - C-2 (11.95): Another favorite of mine! This one had stripped tempura on top of the roll and eel sauce dripped on top, too!\n\n8 - Watermelon man (8.95): It looked like a watermelon piece, how cute! Also, had some mango and macadamia nuts inside it!\n\n9 - Aloha 101 (9.95) - A really original roll. Very fresh tasting and it came with a garlic dipping sauce.\n\n10 - Rock n Roll (7.95) - Not your usual Unagi and avocado rock n roll. This one had baked scallops on top of california roll. I've had this roll better at other restaurants, probably wouldn't order it again.

The food, while tasty, is overpriced (the average price for a roll being at least 12-13 dollars).

Also, there is always, always a wait so it's recommended that you drop a friend off to put your name on the list while you circle (for days) looking for parking.\n\nIf you do find yourself in this part of the city and have a hankering for a modern, fusion take on sushi, though, I do recommend these rolls: \n\n- Five Wishes: (tuna, salmon, hamachi, albacore) and avocado wrapped around a creamy snow crab mixture. It's rice-less and because it is, every piece is soft and creamy and sort of just melts into your mouth.)\n- Rock and Roll: Essentially a California roll baked/topped with a creamy scallop mixture. The scallops are tender, the sauce has a delicious, tasty kick to it, and at only $7.50 (possibly their cheapest roll), this warm delicious roll is a winner.\n- The New Legend: Your standard shrimp tempura roll that's dressed up a little prettier and topped with seared albacore. Solid, reliable, delicious.\n- The C2: Pretty much the same as the New Legend, another reliable roll with familiar components that people always generally like in fancy rolls (lobster, tempura, eel sauce). \n\nThere's also brown rice rolls, a vegetarian section, and a unique list of appetizers that is interesting to try (with names like \"Magic Mushroom\" and \"Butterfish Blasters\" - how can you resist?). \n\nSo,it's good, but there's just that certain je ne sais quoi that's lacking.

CAN'T GO... ONNNNNN.\n\nSushi Bistro is the prime example of a sushi restaurant that's designed for people who do not like sushi. If you love this place, then chances are you're more interested in the sauces than the actual fish, because the fish here is really not that good. \n\nI have a rule and it's served me pretty well throughout the years: if a sushi roll has too much sauce, then they're trying to cover up the poor quality of the fish. In the case of Sushi Bistro, this is completely true. When you eat here, the actual fish is the last ingredient that you can taste in each bite. Every roll is drenched in, doused with, and dominated by so many different sauces that they could easily replace the salmon with tofu and you can't tell the difference. \n\nIt is for this reason that I also ordered some of their sauce-free nigiri. The fresh salmon and tuna are mediocre at best, especially for the prices that Sushi Bistro charges.\n\nNow, that's not to say that the different tastes weren't interesting. They do have some pretty unique and creative rolls here, like the New Legend Roll and the Butterfish Blasters. The only problem is that it's all overpowered by sauce, and way too much of it. The ahi tuna poke dish was probably the worst dish I had here, and I think it's because that's more of a dish with which you can't really hide the fish quality.\n\nBottom line: if you love fresh, quality fish, then stay far far away from Sushi Bistro. But if you want a cool place to hang out with friends over some sake bombs, eating creative & unique rolls, then it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nFor me, however, if the fish is raw, then it'd better be good quality.

So our server promptly replaced it and charged us $1.50\n- Our server asked us if we need another small dish of cucumber sunomomo and later we learned they charged us for $4.50\n\nSeriously both of us spent $120 for dinner and this place -full of greed- is charging us for wasabi and pickled cucumber that other Japanese restaurants give away as condiments.  \n\nWe will not to go back and will not refer our Hawaii friends there when they are in SF.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-05-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Volcano - kind of mayo based (dislike), but the flavor of the overall roll is great, it just melts in your mouth\nButterfish Blasters - holy flavor, its like a burst of flavor \n\n"], "author": "Natasha K.", "review": "I've gone to this location twice, and \"Yay!

We seek untried sushi restaurants in SF, at least untried among the 3 of us. Premise is that there aren't very many good sushi places to go to in SF. Sad but kinda true. So our quest began to uncover the gems of the City.\n\nNot sure Sushi Bistro falls into this category. But if you're looking for ROLLS in an unconventionally modern, dark and hip sushi restaurant,\nthen this is the place for you.\n\nListed in order of most to least fave rolls we tried:\n1. Butterfish Blasters ($13.95) snow crab and avocado wrapped in butterfish lightly torched with a garlic-soy. Based on the description I expected this dish to be hot but it wasn't. Nevertheless, the fish was soft and it was really nice to bite into the crab and avocado rather than a ball of rice.\n\n2. Hawaiian Breeze ($11.95). Mango, avocado and slivered fuji apple topped with tuna, macadamia nuts and drizzled with cilantro pesto. Totally unexpected flavors from the cilantro and pesto but it gave a very 'fresh' aromatic taste to the sushi. Admittedly I barely tasted the tuna. I caught more of the sweetness from the mango and fuji apples. But I liked the creative use of apples. It worked well with this roll.\n\n3. Albacore Dream  ($11.25). Spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This one had a nice heat to it from the spicy tuna, but the spiciness did overpower the \nalbacore, which I typically like to taste and enjoy.\n\n4. C-2  ($12.95). Baby lobster, avocado and cucumber topped with shrimp tempura, drizzled with sweet eel sauce. The shrimp tempura stayed crunchy on top of the roll but overall had a sweet taste. I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster, which was a shame.\n\n5. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon  ($10.95). Shrimp tempura, avocado & cucumber, all topped with unagi and eel sauce. This one was not memorable except that it was a little too sweet especially since it tasted similar to C-2.\n\n6. Monster in-laws  ($12.95). Spicy albacore and cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce. Visually pleasing with the delicate slices of jalapenos but honestly I tasted a fish that was a bit \"fishy\" and so I couldn't eat any more of it.\n\nWhat Sushi Bistro does well is innovative roll names, easy on the rice (awesome), and heavy on the \"stuff\" to roll into the sushi. I could see myself coming back w/ a group of friends so I could try more of the inventive rolls.

Something about the name Sushi Bistro should've gave me the hint that there's a bit of american flare in this sushi.

Why is it so buttery????\n\nSecondly we ordered the role with albacore. It was okay. I wasn't jumping out of my seat for it. again- very heavy with the sauces. Sometimes I feel like the sauces is over powering the fresh meat.\n\nNow the winner, butterfish nigri. I agree with some other posters, perhaps try ordering just their fish to avoid all the heavy sauces, creamy, and fat. I thought the nigri was spot on. Nice huge thick slices, fresh, sweet, just the way butterfish is supposed to taste. Now I like.

It could have been my taste buds, but my boyfriend (who had gone with me the first time) stated that he agreed that the first time was significantly better so it wasn't just me. Also the food came out very quickly, which I would never complain about, but all of our food pretty much arrived all at once.  There was a group of 5 of us and we were not able to fully take in the experience because it seemed very rushed and then we were done eating so we left.  Also, the place wasn't packed so it wasn't like they were trying to get seat other people.  In fact, we were seated in the back room and we had it all to ourselves the entire time until the very end when we were paying our bill.  It could have been a different chef that night.  The thing about a truly great restaurant is that the food is consistent night after night.  Based on that I have to give this 3 stars.  Consistency is key.

The toro was too chewy (we've had much better toro at Ozumo) due to presence of some of the tough connective tissue.  Next we had rolls - in my opinion, this is their forte and what most people come for.  Creative, flavorful, and definitely off the beaten path.  We had the First Crush (spicy albacore tuna, fuji apple, topped with salmon and ginger cilantro ponzu sauce with brown rice), mouth watering good.  We followed this with the Sashimi Spirit (ebi, salmon, ahi tuna, butterfish, tobiko and avocado topped with scallions); a mouthful of flavors that blended together well but lost the individual characteristics.

The butterfish was super buttery.  My cousin described it as a California roll without the rice and seaweed and instead, wrapped in fish...which is exactly what it is.\n~ Hot Love: sort of like the first dish except it had baby lobsters and it was baked.  I liked that it was a little spicy and peppery but that the heat did not overwhelm the dish.\n~ C-2: it was yummy but not as spectacular as everyone else made it out to be.\n~ African Spider: like your regular spider roll with Cajun spices although I didn't taste much of it.  The soft shell crab was still good nonetheless.\n~ Waikiki: most unique roll with mango and macadamia nuts.  The mangoes they used were not ripe so it was hard and sour (tasted more like apples) but I loved the macadamia nuts.\n~ New Wave Mahi-Mahi: you can't really taste the mahi-mahi but I loved the mango salsa in it\n~ Monster-in-Laws: the albacore and yellowtail were really fresh but not that special\n~ Stinky Salmon: the onions actually over-powered everything else but I thought the asparagus added a nice crunch to it\n\nWe also had two large and one small Asahi's, a house sake, another cold sake and a glass of plum wine and our bill came out to $150 including tip.  Yes...four small Asian girls managed to finish all that food and drinks.  It was crazy but we couldn't help ourselves.\n\nI enjoyed everything especially the Butterfish Blasters and Hot Love.  Everything was really unique and I loved that they only use a thin layer of rice for their rolls.  One complaint is that although their menu is huge, a lot of the ingredients repeated in their rolls, i.e. Hawaiian Breeze and Waikiki sounded really similar so it's hard to differentiate between rolls.\n\nAnyway, we kept ordering more food as we devoured the dishes that came but the servers were really nice each time and didn't seem to mind at all even though the place was packed.

Maybe (probably) it's just me being lazy...\n\nCompared to my first trip here, when they were a tiny restaurant just a few doors over, Sushi Bistro has changed quite a bit over the years.  The space is larger, the look/vibe is trendier, and the menu is larger.  Yet, despite how much they've grown, their food hasn't changed.  Whether it's the rolls, sashimi, starters, small dishes, salads, or combo plates, everything looks and tastes just as good as before (from what my friends and I can tell, at least).\n\n-- AHI TUNA POKE SPECIAL - Cubes of Garlic-Soy Marinated Ahi Tuna served over Organic Baby Greens, Avocado, and Crispy Potato Vermicelli...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=J6OS2QeY_TidZm1fXbP74Q)\nPretty good all around.  Not surprisingly, being a Japanese restaurant, the tuna was terrific (so fresh!).  I liked the texture contrast of the potato vermicelli as well, but I felt the sauce was a little lacking, both in quantity and flavor (specifically, it could've used some sesame oil).\n\n-- AFRICAN SPIDER - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Fried Albacore and Salmon, topped with Avocado, Sprouts, Drizzled with a Sweet & Spicy Eel Sauce...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=ApC9vqCx6aWCY2u1su9amw)\nMy favorite of the night, though they have better rolls.  The soft shell crab was fried up quite nicely (crispy!) and each piece was pretty meaty.  Plus, while I'm not usually a big fan of fried fish, it actually worked well in this case.  A little heavy on the sauce, which I found to be a bit sweet, but solid overall.\n\n-- NEMO FOUND ROLL - Salmon, Unagi and Avocado wrapped in Soy Paper and topped with Eel Sauce...$11.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=xSuhZo_7Uem9o8i4bWvvnw)\nMy least favorite of the night, unfortunately.  On paper, it sounded great, albeit simple.  However, despite how fresh the salmon was and how well it usually goes with unagi and avocado, the flavors seemed really light.  So much so that the eel sauce overshadowed everything else.\n\n-- SEXY SCALLOP ROLL - Spicy Albacore, Salmon, and Avocado topped with chopped Hokkaido Scallop, Tobiko, and Scallions in Soy Paper...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=8kgQoull4U6MDktD4oC3NQ)\nWhile I generally like rolls with scallops, I thought this one was just okay.  On the one hand, the scallops were tasty (delicate, clean) and the salmon was great.  On the other, I could have done without the spicy albacore, though I'm generally not big on any \"spicy (fish)\" in my rolls.\n\n-- UNI NIGIRI...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=LXqVraMCyy7MkNJAvb7hxg)\nDelicious!  Each piece of uni had that bright, mustard coloring to them and were oh so flavorful.  The price seemed a shade high for what you get, but there's no question that it was good!\n\nAlthough my experiences with these particular rolls were rather mixed, I've had others in the past that were much better in comparison, such as the Butterfish Blaster, Sashimi Spirit, and the Hirame Fusion.  In addition, their lettuce wraps are worth trying as well, though I've only had the Summer, Fall, and Equinox wraps.\n\nAs far as service goes, I've never had any issues with it myself, but I can see why some find it rough/uneven.  However, what really stops Sushi Bistro from being part of my regular sushi rotation is the parking.  I don't hold it against them with their rating, since it's well beyond their control, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't something I keep in mind (desire to come back vs willingness to circle endlessly).

It does not exist at this restaurant. The dishes are all fusion/Americanized (read: deep fried, spicy sauced, avocado-ed, mango-ed, etc.)\n\nThat aside- the service, first of all, was very good. We got cucumber salad and waters and drinks as soon as we got seated (but charging $1.50 for green tea, COME ON). Waters and teas were refilled really fast, dishes were cleared promptly. \n\nSecond- I made a mistake in thinking that this was a trendy but traditional place. Should've read Yelp reviews first! I ordered a king salmon nigiri, negihamachi roll, salmon roll and cucumber roll. The king salmon was delicious. Negihamachi had cucumber in it...doesn't negihamachi just mean yellowtail with scallions? I could not taste the scallions, could barely taste the fish...really just had the watery taste of cucumbers on my tongue. The salmon roll (I asked for just plain salmon!) had cucumbers AND avocado in it. Didn't I ask for plain salmon? What is up with the filler? Not really impressed as the fish was fresh enough (I think?) but was SO watery and not flavorful, the rolls were poorly constructed (wtf is up with them using almost no rice?) and fell apart easily. The seaweed was soggy in the salmon roll I got. Pretty gross.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't really do the raw fish thing but even he felt like the \"unique\" rolls and dishes were way overdone. Too much sauce, too much fried stuff, too much avocado, too much spicy sauce that didn't taste like anything. My two American friends (whom he shared the dishes with), however, really enjoyed their dishes (hot love, aloha 101, albacore dream, african spider, Caucasian Afro, Spicy Crunchy). So if you're looking for traditional sushi, do not come here. If you're looking for a fusion meal or to start someone off on their first sushi experience, you're probably fine.\n\nIn the end, I definitely wouldn't come back. The meal cost me about $35 tax/tip without alcohol (2 nigiri, three rolls). I'm more of a traditionalist, but even with that in mind I'd be wary of fish that is tasteless/watery and possibly unfresh.

Mad love for the hot love.\n\nWent here on a first date. My date actually introduced me to the place... he  proclaimed it was his favorite sushi spot, regardless of the fact it was also his go-to, uber-convenient neighborhood sushi spot a few blocks away from his house. \n\nThat night we started with the miso black cod on special (a dish I would not normally order) that was like a savory piece of heaven on a plate, lettuce wraps (a choice of \"seasons\" which contain different flavors) and a couple rolls.\n\nI can't say I remember which rolls we got that night, but I've been back several times since I'll just go ahead and list my favorites: Albacore Dream, 49er, Nemo found, Omega 3. There are a ton more, and they are all wildly creative and fun so best bet is to go out on a limb and try something new. And when in doubt, order a roll with avocado.  We joke that there must be a secret avocado orchard oasis in the back of the restaurant because the rolls are literally bursting with the fresh avocado on too-consistent, suspicious basis.\n\nThe sashimi is fresh and the pieces are extremely generous. Ask for a sake recommendation - we got a cold bottle of something I don't remember, other than it being delicious. (This is the kind you won't necessarily want to yell \"sake!\" and slam a beer with, you actually want to take your time to enjoy.)\n\nThe atmosphere is extremely comfortable and friendly. And added bonus, they serve you a scoop of free ice cream to cap off your meal. Flippin' sweet. \n\nI wouldn't recommend going here with a group larger than 4 people, since it's a small place, but regardless of party size, you will most likely need reservations any day of the week. The fare is extremely reasonable, so if you want to go nuts on some great sushi and not feel totally guilty...you totally can.\n\nEven if I had a horrendous, mind-numbing, run-away-screaming-and- lighting-my-hair-on-fire sort of date, I would still risk coming back again and again for the amazing sushi.

There was some sort of reggae/rock music playing and sports playing on TV. The plates on our tables were all different colors and sizes. Some were triangular, others rectangular, some were round, and some were curved upwards on the edges. My serving plate was blue and my boyfriend's was yellow. Visually, it made the experience a less appetizing.\n\nAs for the food, if you like avocado come here. We tried several different rolls, but I felt like each one was an avocado roll.\n\nDouble Jeopardy - This is described as a tartare, but I felt like I was eating a guacamole, that happened to have bits of fish in it. There was just so much avocado filling up the dish. I liked the use of the shrimp chips and the flavors I got when I wasn't eating mouthfuls of avocado.\n\nDrunken Halibut - The halibut was a bit overcooked for my liking. It was a very average dish.\n\nUni Nigiri - Very average quality uni. It's not bad, but it doesn't do uni much justice either. \n\nFive Wishes - The presentation was very unappetizing. The house sauce was all over the plate and it just looked messy. I appreciate that real crab was used, but this dish was almost inedible. Something about the flavor was just off. We just ate the salmon and pieces off the tops of the rolls. Again, there was too much avocado. It said that the rolls were topped but a mixture of fish, but two of the cuts were entirely topped with avocado.\n\nSashimi spirit - I did not taste the spirit of sahimi in this one.

But not special. \n\nNext was my pick and it turned out to be the best selection of the night. Big Island ($13.5)  This huge roll has salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and crab meat wrapped in cucumber. The menu claims to have avocado and sprouts. Very little avocado and no sprouts! Regardless, this one was great. \n\nThe Yellowtail Basil($8) I cant even review this little thing. I feel sorry for him. All I can say is I hope he was having an off day, and if not, he should just end it and jump off the menu.\n\nSashimi Spirit ($10) This guy did have lots of spirit.

The ratings looked great but it's a shame when Yelp fails me.\n\nMy first impression was that the restaurant ambience was a bit disorderly. There was some sort of reggae/rock music playing and sports playing on TV. The plates on our tables were all different colors and sizes. Some were triangular, others rectangular, some were round, and some were curved upwards on the edges. My serving plate was blue and my boyfriend's was yellow. Visually, it made the experience a less appetizing.\n\nAs for the food, if you like avocado come here. We tried several different rolls, but I felt like each one was an avocado roll.\n\nDouble Jeopardy - This is described as a tartare, but I felt like I was eating a guacamole, that happened to have bits of fish in it. There was just so much avocado filling up the dish. I liked the use of the shrimp chips and the flavors I got when I wasn't eating mouthfuls of avocado.\n\nDrunken Halibut - The halibut was a bit overcooked for my liking. It was a very average dish.\n\nUni Nigiri - Very average quality uni. It's not bad, but it doesn't do uni much justice either. \n\nFive Wishes - The presentation was very unappetizing. The house sauce was all over the plate and it just looked messy. I appreciate that real crab was used, but this dish was almost inedible. Something about the flavor was just off. We just ate the salmon and pieces off the tops of the rolls. Again, there was too much avocado. It said that the rolls were topped but a mixture of fish, but two of the cuts were entirely topped with avocado.\n\nSashimi spirit - I did not taste the spirit of sahimi in this one.

I was expecting a little fillet of halibut, but all i got where 8 measly slivers of halibut in some oily miso sauce.

It was presented on a plate with pesto sauce.  I was looking forward to this roll because it had Fatty Tuna, but it turned into a disappointing mess of flavors -- I had no idea what I was tasting.  All that flavor made it pointless to use fatty tuna on top -- they could use halibut, or yellow tail and it would taste the same and the roll would've been cheaper.\n\nAnyways, summary: I felt all there rolls were too done up with sauces.  Most of their rolls are cooked too so if you're a fan of raw fish and subtle taste, I recommend K's Kitchen on Monterey which has unique and fancy rolls with flavors that actually work together without being overpowering.  You'll be spending the same for better food.  If you prefer more cooked rolls, I think Kiki's or Kitaro's or a sushi boat have similar stuff for half the price.  You're basically paying for the atmosphere and better grade of fish (if you order the raw fish).  \n\nAtmosphere:  to loud.

It does not exist at this restaurant. The dishes are all fusion/Americanized (read: deep fried, spicy sauced, avocado-ed, mango-ed, etc.)\n\nThat aside- the service, first of all, was very good. We got cucumber salad and waters and drinks as soon as we got seated (but charging $1.50 for green tea, COME ON). Waters and teas were refilled really fast, dishes were cleared promptly. \n\nSecond- I made a mistake in thinking that this was a trendy but traditional place. Should've read Yelp reviews first! I ordered a king salmon nigiri, negihamachi roll, salmon roll and cucumber roll. The king salmon was delicious. Negihamachi had cucumber in it...doesn't negihamachi just mean yellowtail with scallions? I could not taste the scallions, could barely taste the fish...really just had the watery taste of cucumbers on my tongue. The salmon roll (I asked for just plain salmon!) had cucumbers AND avocado in it. Didn't I ask for plain salmon? What is up with the filler? Not really impressed as the fish was fresh enough (I think?) but was SO watery and not flavorful, the rolls were poorly constructed (wtf is up with them using almost no rice?) and fell apart easily. The seaweed was soggy in the salmon roll I got. Pretty gross.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't really do the raw fish thing but even he felt like the \"unique\" rolls and dishes were way overdone. Too much sauce, too much fried stuff, too much avocado, too much spicy sauce that didn't taste like anything. My two American friends (whom he shared the dishes with), however, really enjoyed their dishes (hot love, aloha 101, albacore dream, african spider, Caucasian Afro, Spicy Crunchy). So if you're looking for traditional sushi, do not come here. If you're looking for a fusion meal or to start someone off on their first sushi experience, you're probably fine.\n\nIn the end, I definitely wouldn't come back. The meal cost me about $35 tax/tip without alcohol (2 nigiri, three rolls). I'm more of a traditionalist, but even with that in mind I'd be wary of fish that is tasteless/watery and possibly unfresh.

"], "author": "Tony V.", "review": "Since Yelp doesn't let you do half-stars, I need to clarify the rating and say that I give this restaurant 3.5 stars. Further clarification on how I feel about sushi. I'm less interested in the debate between \"authentic\" sushi and \"neo\" or \"nouveau\" sushi. If you're one of those sushi purists/traditionalists, this probably isn't the place for you. That said, I feel a little let down after eating here. All the glowing Yelp reviews and personal recommendations from friends got me excited to come here and try this place. This excitement was further compounded when I read over the menu online before coming here and saw the different takes the chef had on sushi. Perhaps my expectation was too high, but still I haven't felt this let down since I found out Jennifer Garner married Ben Affleck. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night around 8 and walked in with no reservations, there was some space at the bar so we were seated immediately. The first thing I noticed was the din. People were conversing loudly to try and be heard over the pounding music. Even sitting in a tight knit group at the bar, my companions and I had to huddle closely to hear each other. No biggie, I've been in loud places before. I liked that they had a decent selection of sake, including 2 of my favorites, Karatamba and Otokayama. I especially liked that they served the sake in wooden boxes, as it should be served.\n\nOn to the food, I had a hard time deciding what to eat, all the descriptions in the menu made everything sound so tasty. I eventually settled for the Spicy Girl (avocado wrapped with spicy white tuna and macadamia nuts), African Spider Roll (Cajun flavored albacore, salmon, soft shell crab in spicy house sauce), and Monster-In-Laws (spicy albacore, cuccumer, onion, topped with yellowtail, jalapeno, and ponzu sauce). I also ordered the yellow tail belly, toro, and kanpachi nigiri. My first impression was that everything was extremely fresh. If nothing else, you know this fish hasn't been sitting around all night under ice like the last kid at dodgeball waiting to be picked. The cuts on the nigiri were large and very clean. The rolls too were very fresh. I especially liked the African Spider Roll, the avocado and fish inside the roll made a good contrast to the perfectly fried soft shell crab (nothing worse than an overly greasy soft shelled crab that tastes like it came from a KFC fryer). The spicy house sauce had a nice little kick to it. The Monster-In-Laws was also good and the jalapeno provided the right amount of heat in each bite. \n\nNow the bad news, some of the plates my companions ordered missed their mark. The Caucasian Afro (spicy tuna mixed with guacamole, onions, tomato sauce, garnished with fried potato vermicelli) was not spicy as advertised and tasted more of avocado than anything else. The Sashimi Spirit (sushi ebi, salmon, ahi tuna, albacore, tobiko, and avocado wrapped in soy paper) was again fresh, but seemed like it was trying to do too much at once with all the flavors. They all kind of muddled together and you didn't get a sense of what the flavor profile was. My companions also ordered the Aloha 101 (Ahi tuna, mango, and cucumber, flash fried and served with spicy garlic sauce), which on the surface sounds really good, but I didn't taste the mango and when you dip it in the garlic sauce, it kinds of kills the other flavors. They also had the Sexy Scallop and Spicy Crunchy rolls. \n\nMy biggest complaint has to be after eating half of all our rolls, they all started tasting the same. You could literally close your eyes, pick a roll at random and eat it and have no idea what you just ate. Herein lies my disappointment. With so much fresh fish at his disposal and so much obvious creative aptitude, the chef could have really come up with some distinct flavor profiles. If anything, I thought he was a little heavy-handed with the sriracha. I love this stuff, but when it gets thrown around too much, everything starts tasting like it. \n\nSo if you come here, stick with the nigiri for the most part.

Honestly, I have no idea why it's been so hard and taken so long for me to write this review.  Despite having eaten here multiple times, I can never seem to get anything done for Sushi Bistro!  Maybe (probably) it's just me being lazy...\n\nCompared to my first trip here, when they were a tiny restaurant just a few doors over, Sushi Bistro has changed quite a bit over the years.  The space is larger, the look/vibe is trendier, and the menu is larger.  Yet, despite how much they've grown, their food hasn't changed.  Whether it's the rolls, sashimi, starters, small dishes, salads, or combo plates, everything looks and tastes just as good as before (from what my friends and I can tell, at least).\n\n-- AHI TUNA POKE SPECIAL - Cubes of Garlic-Soy Marinated Ahi Tuna served over Organic Baby Greens, Avocado, and Crispy Potato Vermicelli...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=J6OS2QeY_TidZm1fXbP74Q)\nPretty good all around.  Not surprisingly, being a Japanese restaurant, the tuna was terrific (so fresh!).  I liked the texture contrast of the potato vermicelli as well, but I felt the sauce was a little lacking, both in quantity and flavor (specifically, it could've used some sesame oil).\n\n-- AFRICAN SPIDER - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Fried Albacore and Salmon, topped with Avocado, Sprouts, Drizzled with a Sweet & Spicy Eel Sauce...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=ApC9vqCx6aWCY2u1su9amw)\nMy favorite of the night, though they have better rolls.  The soft shell crab was fried up quite nicely (crispy!) and each piece was pretty meaty.  Plus, while I'm not usually a big fan of fried fish, it actually worked well in this case.  A little heavy on the sauce, which I found to be a bit sweet, but solid overall.\n\n-- NEMO FOUND ROLL - Salmon, Unagi and Avocado wrapped in Soy Paper and topped with Eel Sauce...$11.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=xSuhZo_7Uem9o8i4bWvvnw)\nMy least favorite of the night, unfortunately.  On paper, it sounded great, albeit simple.  However, despite how fresh the salmon was and how well it usually goes with unagi and avocado, the flavors seemed really light.  So much so that the eel sauce overshadowed everything else.\n\n-- SEXY SCALLOP ROLL - Spicy Albacore, Salmon, and Avocado topped with chopped Hokkaido Scallop, Tobiko, and Scallions in Soy Paper...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=8kgQoull4U6MDktD4oC3NQ)\nWhile I generally like rolls with scallops, I thought this one was just okay.  On the one hand, the scallops were tasty (delicate, clean) and the salmon was great.  On the other, I could have done without the spicy albacore, though I'm generally not big on any \"spicy (fish)\" in my rolls.\n\n-- UNI NIGIRI...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=LXqVraMCyy7MkNJAvb7hxg)\nDelicious!  Each piece of uni had that bright, mustard coloring to them and were oh so flavorful.  The price seemed a shade high for what you get, but there's no question that it was good!\n\nAlthough my experiences with these particular rolls were rather mixed, I've had others in the past that were much better in comparison, such as the Butterfish Blaster, Sashimi Spirit, and the Hirame Fusion.  In addition, their lettuce wraps are worth trying as well, though I've only had the Summer, Fall, and Equinox wraps.\n\nAs far as service goes, I've never had any issues with it myself, but I can see why some find it rough/uneven.  However, what really stops Sushi Bistro from being part of my regular sushi rotation is the parking.  I don't hold it against them with their rating, since it's well beyond their control, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't something I keep in mind (desire to come back vs willingness to circle endlessly).

Honestly, I have no idea why it's been so hard and taken so long for me to write this review.  Despite having eaten here multiple times, I can never seem to get anything done for Sushi Bistro!  Maybe (probably) it's just me being lazy...\n\nCompared to my first trip here, when they were a tiny restaurant just a few doors over, Sushi Bistro has changed quite a bit over the years.  The space is larger, the look/vibe is trendier, and the menu is larger.  Yet, despite how much they've grown, their food hasn't changed.  Whether it's the rolls, sashimi, starters, small dishes, salads, or combo plates, everything looks and tastes just as good as before (from what my friends and I can tell, at least).\n\n-- AHI TUNA POKE SPECIAL - Cubes of Garlic-Soy Marinated Ahi Tuna served over Organic Baby Greens, Avocado, and Crispy Potato Vermicelli...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=J6OS2QeY_TidZm1fXbP74Q)\nPretty good all around.  Not surprisingly, being a Japanese restaurant, the tuna was terrific (so fresh!).  I liked the texture contrast of the potato vermicelli as well, but I felt the sauce was a little lacking, both in quantity and flavor (specifically, it could've used some sesame oil).\n\n-- AFRICAN SPIDER - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Fried Albacore and Salmon, topped with Avocado, Sprouts, Drizzled with a Sweet & Spicy Eel Sauce...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=ApC9vqCx6aWCY2u1su9amw)\nMy favorite of the night, though they have better rolls.  The soft shell crab was fried up quite nicely (crispy!) and each piece was pretty meaty.  Plus, while I'm not usually a big fan of fried fish, it actually worked well in this case.  A little heavy on the sauce, which I found to be a bit sweet, but solid overall.\n\n-- NEMO FOUND ROLL - Salmon, Unagi and Avocado wrapped in Soy Paper and topped with Eel Sauce...$11.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=xSuhZo_7Uem9o8i4bWvvnw)\nMy least favorite of the night, unfortunately.  On paper, it sounded great, albeit simple.  However, despite how fresh the salmon was and how well it usually goes with unagi and avocado, the flavors seemed really light.  So much so that the eel sauce overshadowed everything else.\n\n-- SEXY SCALLOP ROLL - Spicy Albacore, Salmon, and Avocado topped with chopped Hokkaido Scallop, Tobiko, and Scallions in Soy Paper...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=8kgQoull4U6MDktD4oC3NQ)\nWhile I generally like rolls with scallops, I thought this one was just okay.  On the one hand, the scallops were tasty (delicate, clean) and the salmon was great.  On the other, I could have done without the spicy albacore, though I'm generally not big on any \"spicy (fish)\" in my rolls.\n\n-- UNI NIGIRI...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=LXqVraMCyy7MkNJAvb7hxg)\nDelicious!  Each piece of uni had that bright, mustard coloring to them and were oh so flavorful.  The price seemed a shade high for what you get, but there's no question that it was good!\n\nAlthough my experiences with these particular rolls were rather mixed, I've had others in the past that were much better in comparison, such as the Butterfish Blaster, Sashimi Spirit, and the Hirame Fusion.  In addition, their lettuce wraps are worth trying as well, though I've only had the Summer, Fall, and Equinox wraps.\n\nAs far as service goes, I've never had any issues with it myself, but I can see why some find it rough/uneven.  However, what really stops Sushi Bistro from being part of my regular sushi rotation is the parking.  I don't hold it against them with their rating, since it's well beyond their control, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't something I keep in mind (desire to come back vs willingness to circle endlessly).

Tastes exactly like you think it would taste: pretty damn good.\n+ Five Wishes:  I liked this one.  The snow crab in it was really creamy, and the salmon, hamachi, tuna, and some other fish that was on top of the roll was just really good too.  The hamachi was, as usual, the best. \n\nWEIRD:\n- Magic Mushroom:  First, the name.  Magic Mushrooms make me think of two things: 1) Toad from Mario brothers and 2) drugs.  This one just tasted like weird mushy stuff wrapped in something else undecipherable.  Not bad.  Just weird, and a little unnecessary.\n- New Legend: Um, this tasted exactly like the C-2 even though it was supposedly different.  Er, I guess that's a good thing, but there were only two of us, which meant we had to eat a lot of the same thing.  Again, unnecessary.\n\nFinal word:  So yes.  My range for Sushi Bistro is now 3.5 - 4.25.  A new way of reviewing things.  Maybe I should go this route more often.

You're actually hard pressed not to find a roll with it.

And there are tons of tempura roll options.\n\nSo, there might be 2 camps of sushi lovers:\n\n1. hardcore: raw, raw, raw!  Don't dumb it down by flash frying, breading, adding avocado, warming it up, etc.  I just want fish flesh.\n\n2. occasionally raw: yes, raw fish can be good.  but it's better when diluted with avocado, flash friedness, and other delectable veggies or warmth to hide the rawness.\n\nI fall somewhere in the middle.

I don't have much patience so when it comes to parking, and not being able to find one, it definitely kills my vibe. Although I try to keep my ratings independent of the parking, I would still like to share the pain in finding parking around this area. The first time I came, I rated this location a 4 star, and I loved the food and service. The second time i came, we spent about 20 minutes looking for parking, I would rate the parking a 2/5, saying downtown SF is probably a 1/5. \n\nWe ordered the genmai tea which was 1.5 each, out of a teabag. The tea is great, but service was bad. I had to ask every single time for the server to come and fill my tea. There was never a time where the server decided to check on my tea or us in general to see if we needed anything. It wasn't until when we were almost done and leaving did a nice korean server come by. She checked on us a couple of times and that was appreciated. \n\nThis time around, we ordered complete different items to try out their menu as a whole. We tried two different lettuce wrap, the Solstice and winter. Solstice was composed of diced ahi tuna seared, avocado, crunchy flakes and tabasco sauce for $6.95. Winter was made of spicy tuna, avocado, aioli and shrimp tempura. I have to argue that the winter lettuce wrap was more flavorful. I tried winter first then went to Solstice and it tasted very bland.

There was no rice in here. \n\n$14.95 African Spider made of deep-fried soft shell crab, fried albacore and salmon, topped with avocado, sprouts, drizzled with a sweet and spicy eel sauce. I think this was my least favorite because the stuffing inside was pretty thick and hearty. Felt very oily and a bit too much. It was also very salty in the middle too. I would say this is a 3/5. This was a bit too much for me in terms of how heavy it was. I did however enjoy the sauce in this dish. \n\n$12.95 Albacore Dream composed of spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This would probably be a 4/5. This dish was pretty spicy, as it was topped with spicy tabasco like sauce on top. I did like the middle which was the spicy tuna and avocado inside. \n\n\nOverall food is great, service is highly lacked, and parking is horrendous.

Honestly, I have no idea why it's been so hard and taken so long for me to write this review.  Despite having eaten here multiple times, I can never seem to get anything done for Sushi Bistro!  Maybe (probably) it's just me being lazy...\n\nCompared to my first trip here, when they were a tiny restaurant just a few doors over, Sushi Bistro has changed quite a bit over the years.  The space is larger, the look/vibe is trendier, and the menu is larger.  Yet, despite how much they've grown, their food hasn't changed.  Whether it's the rolls, sashimi, starters, small dishes, salads, or combo plates, everything looks and tastes just as good as before (from what my friends and I can tell, at least).\n\n-- AHI TUNA POKE SPECIAL - Cubes of Garlic-Soy Marinated Ahi Tuna served over Organic Baby Greens, Avocado, and Crispy Potato Vermicelli...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=J6OS2QeY_TidZm1fXbP74Q)\nPretty good all around.  Not surprisingly, being a Japanese restaurant, the tuna was terrific (so fresh!).  I liked the texture contrast of the potato vermicelli as well, but I felt the sauce was a little lacking, both in quantity and flavor (specifically, it could've used some sesame oil).\n\n-- AFRICAN SPIDER - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Fried Albacore and Salmon, topped with Avocado, Sprouts, Drizzled with a Sweet & Spicy Eel Sauce...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=ApC9vqCx6aWCY2u1su9amw)\nMy favorite of the night, though they have better rolls.  The soft shell crab was fried up quite nicely (crispy!) and each piece was pretty meaty.  Plus, while I'm not usually a big fan of fried fish, it actually worked well in this case.  A little heavy on the sauce, which I found to be a bit sweet, but solid overall.\n\n-- NEMO FOUND ROLL - Salmon, Unagi and Avocado wrapped in Soy Paper and topped with Eel Sauce...$11.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=xSuhZo_7Uem9o8i4bWvvnw)\nMy least favorite of the night, unfortunately.  On paper, it sounded great, albeit simple.  However, despite how fresh the salmon was and how well it usually goes with unagi and avocado, the flavors seemed really light.  So much so that the eel sauce overshadowed everything else.\n\n-- SEXY SCALLOP ROLL - Spicy Albacore, Salmon, and Avocado topped with chopped Hokkaido Scallop, Tobiko, and Scallions in Soy Paper...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=8kgQoull4U6MDktD4oC3NQ)\nWhile I generally like rolls with scallops, I thought this one was just okay.  On the one hand, the scallops were tasty (delicate, clean) and the salmon was great.  On the other, I could have done without the spicy albacore, though I'm generally not big on any \"spicy (fish)\" in my rolls.\n\n-- UNI NIGIRI...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=LXqVraMCyy7MkNJAvb7hxg)\nDelicious!  Each piece of uni had that bright, mustard coloring to them and were oh so flavorful.  The price seemed a shade high for what you get, but there's no question that it was good!\n\nAlthough my experiences with these particular rolls were rather mixed, I've had others in the past that were much better in comparison, such as the Butterfish Blaster, Sashimi Spirit, and the Hirame Fusion.  In addition, their lettuce wraps are worth trying as well, though I've only had the Summer, Fall, and Equinox wraps.\n\nAs far as service goes, I've never had any issues with it myself, but I can see why some find it rough/uneven.  However, what really stops Sushi Bistro from being part of my regular sushi rotation is the parking.  I don't hold it against them with their rating, since it's well beyond their control, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't something I keep in mind (desire to come back vs willingness to circle endlessly).

I don't have much patience so when it comes to parking, and not being able to find one, it definitely kills my vibe. Although I try to keep my ratings independent of the parking, I would still like to share the pain in finding parking around this area. The first time I came, I rated this location a 4 star, and I loved the food and service. The second time i came, we spent about 20 minutes looking for parking, I would rate the parking a 2/5, saying downtown SF is probably a 1/5. \n\nWe ordered the genmai tea which was 1.5 each, out of a teabag. The tea is great, but service was bad. I had to ask every single time for the server to come and fill my tea. There was never a time where the server decided to check on my tea or us in general to see if we needed anything. It wasn't until when we were almost done and leaving did a nice korean server come by. She checked on us a couple of times and that was appreciated. \n\nThis time around, we ordered complete different items to try out their menu as a whole. We tried two different lettuce wrap, the Solstice and winter. Solstice was composed of diced ahi tuna seared, avocado, crunchy flakes and tabasco sauce for $6.95. Winter was made of spicy tuna, avocado, aioli and shrimp tempura. I have to argue that the winter lettuce wrap was more flavorful. I tried winter first then went to Solstice and it tasted very bland. Each of the lettuce wrap was a few cents off from 7 dollars. In my opinion, I fee like they are over priced for what they are. \n\nWe also ordered 5 wishes which was a popular item off yelp. \n$15.95 Five Wishes made of snow crab topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served with mixed greens and house creamy sauce (no rice). I would rate this a 5/5. This was very fresh and I enjoyed the taste and texture of this. Beautiful picture as well. There was no rice in here. \n\n$14.95 African Spider made of deep-fried soft shell crab, fried albacore and salmon, topped with avocado, sprouts, drizzled with a sweet and spicy eel sauce. I think this was my least favorite because the stuffing inside was pretty thick and hearty. Felt very oily and a bit too much. It was also very salty in the middle too. I would say this is a 3/5. This was a bit too much for me in terms of how heavy it was. I did however enjoy the sauce in this dish. \n\n$12.95 Albacore Dream composed of spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This would probably be a 4/5. This dish was pretty spicy, as it was topped with spicy tabasco like sauce on top. I did like the middle which was the spicy tuna and avocado inside. \n\n\nOverall food is great, service is highly lacked, and parking is horrendous.

That being said, the menu does have some options that can easily be made Whole30-friendly and is allergy-friendly in general.\n\nFor those not restricted by allergies or elimination diets, there's plenty to choose from on the menu: various rolls (classic, \"unique\", riceless, brown rice, veggie), sashimi/nigiri, lettuce cups, teriyaki, noodles, salads and appetizers. I loved the cute names they had for a lot of their rolls (like Nemo Found), but they mostly looked like any other sushi bar's rolls, aka a more-or-less random combination of fish with avocado and cucumber, maybe some other veggie, and some sort of sauce. Nothing super special or unique.\n\nI went with 2 of their riceless sushi rolls due to my dietary restrictions and found them to be just okay. I've had riceless sushi rolls at other places that were more inspired than just fish, avocado and cucumber, so I found their rolls to be disappointing in comparison and lacking in creativity. Also pretty pricey given there wasn't necessarily any more fish in them than a normal roll. The 2 rolls were in fact pretty much the exact same thing, just presented differently - one had everything wrapped in cucumber, the other had the fish on the outside. Unfortunately they don't have fresh snow crab, only crab mixed with mayo, so I had to leave that out of my rolls.

Honestly, I have no idea why it's been so hard and taken so long for me to write this review.  Despite having eaten here multiple times, I can never seem to get anything done for Sushi Bistro!  Maybe (probably) it's just me being lazy...\n\nCompared to my first trip here, when they were a tiny restaurant just a few doors over, Sushi Bistro has changed quite a bit over the years.  The space is larger, the look/vibe is trendier, and the menu is larger.  Yet, despite how much they've grown, their food hasn't changed.  Whether it's the rolls, sashimi, starters, small dishes, salads, or combo plates, everything looks and tastes just as good as before (from what my friends and I can tell, at least).\n\n-- AHI TUNA POKE SPECIAL - Cubes of Garlic-Soy Marinated Ahi Tuna served over Organic Baby Greens, Avocado, and Crispy Potato Vermicelli...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=J6OS2QeY_TidZm1fXbP74Q)\nPretty good all around.  Not surprisingly, being a Japanese restaurant, the tuna was terrific (so fresh!).  I liked the texture contrast of the potato vermicelli as well, but I felt the sauce was a little lacking, both in quantity and flavor (specifically, it could've used some sesame oil).\n\n-- AFRICAN SPIDER - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Fried Albacore and Salmon, topped with Avocado, Sprouts, Drizzled with a Sweet & Spicy Eel Sauce...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=ApC9vqCx6aWCY2u1su9amw)\nMy favorite of the night, though they have better rolls.  The soft shell crab was fried up quite nicely (crispy!) and each piece was pretty meaty.  Plus, while I'm not usually a big fan of fried fish, it actually worked well in this case.  A little heavy on the sauce, which I found to be a bit sweet, but solid overall.\n\n-- NEMO FOUND ROLL - Salmon, Unagi and Avocado wrapped in Soy Paper and topped with Eel Sauce...$11.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=xSuhZo_7Uem9o8i4bWvvnw)\nMy least favorite of the night, unfortunately.  On paper, it sounded great, albeit simple.  However, despite how fresh the salmon was and how well it usually goes with unagi and avocado, the flavors seemed really light.  So much so that the eel sauce overshadowed everything else.\n\n-- SEXY SCALLOP ROLL - Spicy Albacore, Salmon, and Avocado topped with chopped Hokkaido Scallop, Tobiko, and Scallions in Soy Paper...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=8kgQoull4U6MDktD4oC3NQ)\nWhile I generally like rolls with scallops, I thought this one was just okay.  On the one hand, the scallops were tasty (delicate, clean) and the salmon was great.  On the other, I could have done without the spicy albacore, though I'm generally not big on any \"spicy (fish)\" in my rolls.\n\n-- UNI NIGIRI...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=LXqVraMCyy7MkNJAvb7hxg)\nDelicious!  Each piece of uni had that bright, mustard coloring to them and were oh so flavorful.  The price seemed a shade high for what you get, but there's no question that it was good!\n\nAlthough my experiences with these particular rolls were rather mixed, I've had others in the past that were much better in comparison, such as the Butterfish Blaster, Sashimi Spirit, and the Hirame Fusion.  In addition, their lettuce wraps are worth trying as well, though I've only had the Summer, Fall, and Equinox wraps.\n\nAs far as service goes, I've never had any issues with it myself, but I can see why some find it rough/uneven.  However, what really stops Sushi Bistro from being part of my regular sushi rotation is the parking.  I don't hold it against them with their rating, since it's well beyond their control, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't something I keep in mind (desire to come back vs willingness to circle endlessly).  If there was a guarantee of finding a space though?

I don't have much patience so when it comes to parking, and not being able to find one, it definitely kills my vibe. Although I try to keep my ratings independent of the parking, I would still like to share the pain in finding parking around this area. The first time I came, I rated this location a 4 star, and I loved the food and service. The second time i came, we spent about 20 minutes looking for parking, I would rate the parking a 2/5, saying downtown SF is probably a 1/5. \n\nWe ordered the genmai tea which was 1.5 each, out of a teabag. The tea is great, but service was bad. I had to ask every single time for the server to come and fill my tea. There was never a time where the server decided to check on my tea or us in general to see if we needed anything. It wasn't until when we were almost done and leaving did a nice korean server come by. She checked on us a couple of times and that was appreciated. \n\nThis time around, we ordered complete different items to try out their menu as a whole. We tried two different lettuce wrap, the Solstice and winter. Solstice was composed of diced ahi tuna seared, avocado, crunchy flakes and tabasco sauce for $6.95. Winter was made of spicy tuna, avocado, aioli and shrimp tempura. I have to argue that the winter lettuce wrap was more flavorful. I tried winter first then went to Solstice and it tasted very bland. Each of the lettuce wrap was a few cents off from 7 dollars. In my opinion, I fee like they are over priced for what they are. \n\nWe also ordered 5 wishes which was a popular item off yelp. \n$15.95 Five Wishes made of snow crab topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served with mixed greens and house creamy sauce (no rice). I would rate this a 5/5. This was very fresh and I enjoyed the taste and texture of this. Beautiful picture as well. There was no rice in here. \n\n$14.95 African Spider made of deep-fried soft shell crab, fried albacore and salmon, topped with avocado, sprouts, drizzled with a sweet and spicy eel sauce. I think this was my least favorite because the stuffing inside was pretty thick and hearty. Felt very oily and a bit too much. It was also very salty in the middle too. I would say this is a 3/5. This was a bit too much for me in terms of how heavy it was. I did however enjoy the sauce in this dish. \n\n$12.95 Albacore Dream composed of spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This would probably be a 4/5. This dish was pretty spicy, as it was topped with spicy tabasco like sauce on top. I did like the middle which was the spicy tuna and avocado inside. \n\n\nOverall food is great, service is highly lacked, and parking is horrendous.

"], "author": "Erin W.", "review": "Sushi Bistro is tucked away on Balboa in the Inner Richmond, between 5th and 6th Avenues. On a cold San Francisco evening, it seems a little weird to meet up with friends to have sushi, but this girl loves her sushi! \n\nWhen I walked in the door, I told the hostess I was meeting about 4 or 5 of my friends for dinner. She was rather rude to me, looking at me like I didn't belong. Then said they weren't there. Then said \"There is a group around the corner\". Kind of confused, I ended up finding my friends.\n\nWe were waiting on a 5th person to arrive who was running late, so we decided to order drinks. They have a pretty nice selection of beers, wine, and sake. I ordered beer, one of us ordered hot sake, and the rest had wine. \n\nOur server kept coming back to see if we were ready to order. She was rather rude about it as if we were taking up a valuable table. By the time our 5th friend arrived, only 20 minutes had passed so it wasn't as if we had been waiting for an hour. And there was a good crowd in the restaurant so it wasn't as if they were losing money on us sitting at a table having drinks. \n\nWe placed our order and the food came out fast. Probably the fastest I've experienced from a sushi restaurant. Because my rule of thumb on trying a new sushi place is to order the spicy tuna roll I ordered that and the unagi. The spicy tuna roll was not too spicy and not too mild and the tuna was really really fresh. With the unagi, you receive 2 pieces and they are huge and really really fresh. \n\nAfter dinner ended, we ordered more drinks so we could spend more time catching up as we all hadn't seen each other in a while. However, after we had been there maybe another 20 minutes after our plates were cleared the server was growing anxious to get us out the door. She gave us our bill and told us that we could only pay with 2 credit cards (apparently they only allow 2 credit cards per table) so we had to split the bill in half and pay each other using Venmo.

Since by definition, there really is no such thing as a sushi bistro, I had my doubts, but those fears subsided once I took a quick look on Yelp and found a four-star rating.\n\nThe place took reservations, which is sometimes a rarity in the city. There's a bar and then like a row of tables alongside one wall. There are also more tables in the back, although I didn't see how many, but I took a quick glance when going to the restroom. \n\nI guess no one eats at 5:30 except for me in the city, so we were immediately seated. They brought us some green tea, with teabags in the cups, which made me wary because you only see that in non-Japanese-owned establishments. Speaking of which, I looked behind the sushi-counter and didn't really see anyone who looked Japanese. Oh well, with almost 1,000 reviews and a four-star average, I had to trust in the system. \n\nFor three of us, we just kept the rolls coming. What was great was that we would order one or two at a time and when they were brought out, we would order another, but there were not huge lulls in between. They came out at just the right pace and our waiter/host was really nice, and then I learned he spoke Mandarin when he was talking to the table next to us, which kind of threw me for a loop. So we got the following:\n\n1) african spider   12.95 (NOT A FAN, THERE WAS SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THE SAUCE AND THE WAY IT WAS FRIED, PASS!)\nsoft shell crab, sprouts, tobiko, deep-fried cajun albacore and salmon topped with avocado, eel sauce, and spicy sauce.\n\n2) monster in-laws   12.95 (WAS SUGGESTED THIS OVER THE YT JALAPENO, AND IT WAS GOOD)\nchopped spicy albacore, cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce.\n\n3) rock'n roll   8.25 (ALTHOUGH NOT A ROLL, IT STILL CAME IN 8 PIECES AND WAS MY FAVORITE OF THE MEAL)\nbaked spicy scallops served on top of a California roll. \n\n4) 49er     8.95 (ALWAYS LOVE THE REFRESHING COMBINATION OF SALMON AND LEMON)\navocado and tobiko topped with salmon and lemon.\n\n5) aloha 101   9.95 (REALLY PRETTY PRESENTATION WITH THE SUSHI, MARRED BY WHAT DK CALLED LEFTOVER RAMEN SOUP BASE FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE.

PLAIN OL' WASABI AND SOY SAUCE WAS BETTER)\nahi tuna, mango & cucumber wrapped in seaweed, flash-fried, served with spicy garlic sauce.\n\n6) butterfish blasters   13.95 (ORDERED THESE BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL.

From the ubiquitous California roll and spicy tuna roll to the more adventurous sexy scallop roll (spicy white tuna, salmon, and avocado topped with spicy chopped scallop, tobiko and scallions:  piquant and yummy) and the big island roll (salmon, tuna, yellowtail  tobiko, snow crab, avocado, and sprouts wrapped inside a thinly sliced cucumber:  absolutely delicate and delicious) diners will not be disappointed.  An unique selection of non-traditional appetizers does not disappoint:  jalapeno hamachi sashimi, ahi poke, and seared branzino (sea bass) with daikon were all super.\n\nThere is a good selection of premium sakes, including the fresh, clean Suigei and the sweet, melon-like Otokoyama, as well as hard to find Japanese beers like Echigo in addition to the normal Sapporo and Kirin.\n\nService was super-fast and friendly.  Dishes arrived quickly and used plates were removed almost immediately.  In addition, the servers were knowledgeable about the menu and the preparation processes of many menu items.\n\nIf you are in the neighborhood, swim on over to Sushi Bistro for some of the best sushi in the Inner Richmond.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-10-10"}, {"excerpts": ["chopped tartar style, mixed with wasabi aioli, spicy garlic soy & served with shrimp chips\n\n-Rolls-\nM&L forever   \nspicy tuna, crab meat, cajun flavored albacore, avocado, and grilled big eye tuna inside a crispy exterior drizzled with bonito sauce\n\nRed Devil   \nbutterfish tempura, aioli, avocado & cucumber, topped with spicy tuna, scallions, and red serano ginger sauce.\n\n"], "author": "Jacquelynne S.", "review": "I've been searching for a good sushi place in the city and I haven't quite found a spot that I can rave about, let alone \"crown\" as my top sushi place.

In the case of Sushi Bistro, this is completely true. When you eat here, the actual fish is the last ingredient that you can taste in each bite. Every roll is drenched in, doused with, and dominated by so many different sauces that they could easily replace the salmon with tofu and you can't tell the difference. \n\nIt is for this reason that I also ordered some of their sauce-free nigiri. The fresh salmon and tuna are mediocre at best, especially for the prices that Sushi Bistro charges.\n\nNow, that's not to say that the different tastes weren't interesting.

This one just tasted like weird mushy stuff wrapped in something else undecipherable.  Not bad.  Just weird, and a little unnecessary.\n- New Legend: Um, this tasted exactly like the C-2 even though it was supposedly different.  Er, I guess that's a good thing, but there were only two of us, which meant we had to eat a lot of the same thing.  Again, unnecessary.\n\nFinal word:  So yes.

Sad but kinda true. So our quest began to uncover the gems of the City.\n\nNot sure Sushi Bistro falls into this category. But if you're looking for ROLLS in an unconventionally modern, dark and hip sushi restaurant,\nthen this is the place for you.\n\nListed in order of most to least fave rolls we tried:\n1. Butterfish Blasters ($13.95) snow crab and avocado wrapped in butterfish lightly torched with a garlic-soy. Based on the description I expected this dish to be hot but it wasn't. Nevertheless, the fish was soft and it was really nice to bite into the crab and avocado rather than a ball of rice.\n\n2. Hawaiian Breeze ($11.95). Mango, avocado and slivered fuji apple topped with tuna, macadamia nuts and drizzled with cilantro pesto. Totally unexpected flavors from the cilantro and pesto but it gave a very 'fresh' aromatic taste to the sushi. Admittedly I barely tasted the tuna. I caught more of the sweetness from the mango and fuji apples. But I liked the creative use of apples. It worked well with this roll.\n\n3. Albacore Dream  ($11.25). Spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This one had a nice heat to it from the spicy tuna, but the spiciness did overpower the \nalbacore, which I typically like to taste and enjoy.\n\n4. C-2  ($12.95). Baby lobster, avocado and cucumber topped with shrimp tempura, drizzled with sweet eel sauce. The shrimp tempura stayed crunchy on top of the roll but overall had a sweet taste. I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster, which was a shame.\n\n5. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon  ($10.95). Shrimp tempura, avocado & cucumber, all topped with unagi and eel sauce. This one was not memorable except that it was a little too sweet especially since it tasted similar to C-2.\n\n6. Monster in-laws  ($12.95). Spicy albacore and cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce. Visually pleasing with the delicate slices of jalapenos but honestly I tasted a fish that was a bit \"fishy\" and so I couldn't eat any more of it.\n\nWhat Sushi Bistro does well is innovative roll names, easy on the rice (awesome), and heavy on the \"stuff\" to roll into the sushi.

"], "author": "Sean K.", "review": "A unique and modern spin on classic sushi roles.\n\nWe decided to venture beyond our usual sushi joints this week and found ourselves the patrons of Sushi Bistro located on the outskirts of Inner Richmond. The first thing that strikes you is that this is a place for young, but experienced, sushi eaters. The prices keep the college age riffraff  away while the more bombastic atmosphere is likely to turn off anyone in the 40+ crowd. But for those with a youthful attitude and some cash to spend, you could do a lot worse than Sushi Bistro.\n\nI tried one of their specialty rolls, the African Spider, and the more classic Caterpillar Roll. Both were constructed with high grade ingredients and very flavorful. The caterpillar, tragically, lacked a certain level of cohesion and thus fell apart without careful chopstick action, but I had mastered the technique by the third attempt. I will say both rolls were HUGE, and because of the rich flavor, I can't recommend eating one roll on your own... it's just too much unless you really want a lot of one thing. Better to take a date and split a few rolls to vary the experience.\n\nThere was also an order of poke at the table, which I would describe as \"deconstructed\". I didn't try any myself, but those who did said while the tuna itself wasn't \"the best\", the dish when eaten as a whole was quite good. That seems to be a good way to describe a lot of what's going on at Sushi Bistro.\n\nOn a lark, Diner B and I tried their shooters, which for some reason do not appear on their online menu. If memory serves, it was a raw oyster, quail egg, some roe and a good helping of sake. Frankly, it was more than I could shoot all at once, which detracted from the overall experience. Can't say I would bother with the expense again.\n\nAlso, the miso soup was only so-so. But the point of the place, as I see it, isn't just about the food. It's about the atmosphere. So, if you aren't looking for the purist experience and are willing to spend a little more, this would be a great date place.

I usually steer clear of those, because I know that it's just a bunch of fluff that will confuse my tastebuds more than satisfy me.  \n\nMoving on... the spicy tuna rolls were super.  I had something with Yellowtail in it, but I can't put my finger on the name because it's been a while since my visit, and it was ok.\n\nMy guests had the spider rolls, and apparently, my friend from Turkey had never known that soft shell crab existed...  The idea of eating the whole damned thing boggled her mind., but once she got her first taste, she quickly made haste to flag down a server and make sure I order her another portion.  That MUST mean something.  \n\nMy native SF friends helping me play tour guide had the sashimi plates, and they looked incredibly good.  Thick, fatty morsels of vibrant bits of fish... I had to look away while they ate to make sure I did not commit the sin of coveting the contents on my neighbor's plate.  I'm definitely going to try what they had if ever I am in the area again.\n\n3.5 stars... good and fresh, but I really have to work the \"fusion\" idea into my head one more time to be adventurous here, and the staff did a wonderful job making sure we had everything we needed for the night.  A small part of this rating could have been higher if it weren't for the smell that I noticed from the paint off-gassing.  Overall, I had a great time here, and I wouldn't mind it if someone persuaded me to come back again, with a fat plate of sashimi!  =D", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Watermelon-Man (a derivation on spicy tuna roll)\n", "Big Island (mixture of sashimi rolled in a artistic cucumber slice)\n", "Rainbow (classic california roll with assorted sashimi on top)\n"], "author": "Christopher Y.", "review": "I wasn't prepared for the ambiance (or relative lack thereof) but my wife said her co-workers told her to expect crowded and loud.

I am no expert on sushi preparation technique, but the slices of fish on the nigiri were huge and thick, and sliced in a way that left them tough and chewy. They were also lacking in the rice department... each piece of nigiri had about a tablespoon of rice attached, and there was no wasabi in them!!\n\nFinally, I had a roll which is not on the on-line menu, and I can't remember the name of it. The waiter helpfully suggested it when I said I wanted something with crab that wasn't too mayonnaise-y. He described it, quite accurately, as a Rainbow Roll filled with crab instead of rice. It arrived in a beautiful presentation, the slices of the roll arranged in a circle around some dressed mixed greens. I enthusiastically took my first bite and was saddened, then sickened by the plastic, manufactured taste of imitation crab. I know that many MANY rolls are made with imitation crab, but this just had a disgustingly distinct and fake flavor to it. I truly couldn't eat it.

We called at 5:45pm while en route to the restaurant and asked for a reservation for two at 6:30pm - well, no tables, but they were able to put us down for the sushi bar.  When we arrived at 6:30, they opened up a table for us instead!  The service was very good - prompt and attentive, water always filled, beer glass never empty too long, plates cleared quickly, and importantly the servers were not intrusive or too involved with chatting up the clientele. \n\nI agree with previous reviewers that this is not your typical japanese restaurant.  It definitely has more of a sports bar/lounge vibe with dark ambiance (too dark for us), flat screen tv's, and LOUD music (turn it down a little so we can enjoy the excellent food please).\n\nThe food was quite delicious, and average to slightly above average in price.   Butterfish blasters to start with (crab meat, avocado wrapped in butterfish and then seared - served with a spicy soy glaze), damn good.  Nigiri sushi next - hamachi, toro, uni, and amaebi (with deep fried shrimp heads with ponzu dipping sauce); huge cuts of fish, tiny ball of rice. Not really your classic ratio of rice:fish for nigiri, but I won't argue with the generous cuts of fish.  Very fresh and tasty.  The toro was too chewy (we've had much better toro at Ozumo) due to presence of some of the tough connective tissue.  Next we had rolls - in my opinion, this is their forte and what most people come for.  Creative, flavorful, and definitely off the beaten path.  We had the First Crush (spicy albacore tuna, fuji apple, topped with salmon and ginger cilantro ponzu sauce with brown rice), mouth watering good.  We followed this with the Sashimi Spirit (ebi, salmon, ahi tuna, butterfish, tobiko and avocado topped with scallions); a mouthful of flavors that blended together well but lost the individual characteristics.

Further clarification on how I feel about sushi. I'm less interested in the debate between \"authentic\" sushi and \"neo\" or \"nouveau\" sushi. If you're one of those sushi purists/traditionalists, this probably isn't the place for you. That said, I feel a little let down after eating here. All the glowing Yelp reviews and personal recommendations from friends got me excited to come here and try this place. This excitement was further compounded when I read over the menu online before coming here and saw the different takes the chef had on sushi. Perhaps my expectation was too high, but still I haven't felt this let down since I found out Jennifer Garner married Ben Affleck. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night around 8 and walked in with no reservations, there was some space at the bar so we were seated immediately. The first thing I noticed was the din. People were conversing loudly to try and be heard over the pounding music. Even sitting in a tight knit group at the bar, my companions and I had to huddle closely to hear each other. No biggie, I've been in loud places before. I liked that they had a decent selection of sake, including 2 of my favorites, Karatamba and Otokayama. I especially liked that they served the sake in wooden boxes, as it should be served.\n\nOn to the food, I had a hard time deciding what to eat, all the descriptions in the menu made everything sound so tasty. I eventually settled for the Spicy Girl (avocado wrapped with spicy white tuna and macadamia nuts), African Spider Roll (Cajun flavored albacore, salmon, soft shell crab in spicy house sauce), and Monster-In-Laws (spicy albacore, cuccumer, onion, topped with yellowtail, jalapeno, and ponzu sauce).

They also had the Sexy Scallop and Spicy Crunchy rolls. \n\nMy biggest complaint has to be after eating half of all our rolls, they all started tasting the same. You could literally close your eyes, pick a roll at random and eat it and have no idea what you just ate. Herein lies my disappointment. With so much fresh fish at his disposal and so much obvious creative aptitude, the chef could have really come up with some distinct flavor profiles. If anything, I thought he was a little heavy-handed with the sriracha.

But I like places that are a bit out there, because it forces me into new neighborhoods, and to new streets and ALL sorts of ways to get from point A to point B.  Trip planner on 511.org anyone?\n\nMy friend brought me here--she raved about the place!  It's small, no frills.  The food I had was delicious.  Especially liked the appetizer at the beginning that was a mix of tuna, (I think) avocado, etc. and came with crispy chips.\n\nWhich leads me to what I'll say next about it.  The food was great, but not super hard core.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I'm just saying.\n\nWhat the heck do I mean when I say hard core?\n\nI mean that most of the rolls have avocado.  You're actually hard pressed not to find a roll with it.  Guess it's good for California, but if you're looking for straight, unfiltered rawness, you have to stick to sashimi (which is excellent, and HUGE here, by the way).  And there are tons of tempura roll options.\n\nSo, there might be 2 camps of sushi lovers:\n\n1. hardcore: raw, raw, raw!  Don't dumb it down by flash frying, breading, adding avocado, warming it up, etc.  I just want fish flesh.\n\n2. occasionally raw: yes, raw fish can be good.  but it's better when diluted with avocado, flash friedness, and other delectable veggies or warmth to hide the rawness.\n\nI fall somewhere in the middle.  This place leaned toward #2, but it was all well done for what it was.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.  Yay for that!\n\nPS--sorry for the all-over-the-placeness of this review.

I was still skeptical when I went inside to see who was behind the sushibar, but boy, really my loss. \n\nThe nigiri here ROCKS!  Very fresh, HUGE cuts, larger than the sashimi slices at other places.  My only complaint is that they use so little rice for their nigiri here that when you dab it in soysauce, it's easy to lose it.  Would be nice if they pre-added some wasabi too, but those are trivial details.  I particularly liked the butterfish and the yellowtail belly.  They aren't stingy with their toro either, it was the same size as everything else.  Very well priced, I was caught off guard by their sushi combination, which left me pretty full.  However, as all the other yelpers say, do get the tuna poke salad, the tuna is ordinary but the sauce is zesty and they add these little crunchy salty things that adds a ton of flavor and texture.  The hamachi kama was not nearly as good as the other stuff though.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from a 5star rating is the in/out nature of this place.

I heard a few people mention positive things about it so I was hoping for good sushi.  What I got was OK food.  First off, we ordered the seared halibut marinated in some miso sauce (Drunken Halibut?).  I was expecting a little fillet of halibut, but all i got where 8 measly slivers of halibut in some oily miso sauce.  The fish and the sauce didn't work well together which resulted in bland seared halibut.  I kept re-dipping the sliver into the sauce hoping to taste something.  Next I tried their Mackerel and Yellow-tail Nigiri.  The Nigiri looked weird in that the fish slab was HUGE compared to the rice which made the fish look kind of gross.  I enjoyed the Mackerel Nigiri which was tasty, the Yellow-tail however was bland and served too cold.  I had to eat some ginger just to warm my palate back up.   Afterward, the rolls we ordered came in.  First was the rainbow roll.  Looked like your typical rainbow roll however, for 9 bucks, i was expecting some imitation crab meat with cucumber and avocado on the inside of the roll.  What we got was a massive amount of imitation crab meat in a roll with with the diameter of a half dollar coin.  I felt like I was eating at some sushi buffet and tasted like it too!  Next came in the Spicy Crunchy roll.  This was a deep fried roll (which we didn't expect).  It arrived on a plate drizzled in some Mustard sauce and Hot sauce.  To put it briefly BLAND and boring despite their sauce efforts.  Last came the special roll of the day which had marinated seared fatty tuna on top with tempura asparagus, and other stuff inside.  It was presented on a plate with pesto sauce.  I was looking forward to this roll because it had Fatty Tuna, but it turned into a disappointing mess of flavors -- I had no idea what I was tasting.  All that flavor made it pointless to use fatty tuna on top -- they could use halibut, or yellow tail and it would taste the same and the roll would've been cheaper.\n\nAnyways, summary: I felt all there rolls were too done up with sauces.  Most of their rolls are cooked too so if you're a fan of raw fish and subtle taste, I recommend K's Kitchen on Monterey which has unique and fancy rolls with flavors that actually work together without being overpowering.  You'll be spending the same for better food.  If you prefer more cooked rolls, I think Kiki's or Kitaro's or a sushi boat have similar stuff for half the price.  You're basically paying for the atmosphere and better grade of fish (if you order the raw fish).  \n\nAtmosphere:  to loud.

Its crab and avocado rolled up in butterfish, and lightly torched on the outside. Damn I just salivated while writing that. Anyways, the fish stays mostly raw, and this is an EXCELLENT dish. The butterfly is very flavorful, and the crab meat inside is well seasoned. I'd say a must get.\n\nAfrican Spider Roll:\nGot this on yelp recommendations. It was definitely good, but can't say it was that much above a spider roll elsewhere. I do have to say, that I normally find spider rolls overstuffed with sprouts, and the end pieces aren't as pleasant to eat; however, this roll did not have that problem, and they also left the large pieces of crab out of the roll, to eat on the side. \n\nYellowtail and Tuna sashimi:\nWOW.

I've had riceless sushi rolls at other places that were more inspired than just fish, avocado and cucumber, so I found their rolls to be disappointing in comparison and lacking in creativity. Also pretty pricey given there wasn't necessarily any more fish in them than a normal roll. The 2 rolls were in fact pretty much the exact same thing, just presented differently - one had everything wrapped in cucumber, the other had the fish on the outside. Unfortunately they don't have fresh snow crab, only crab mixed with mayo, so I had to leave that out of my rolls. Instead, they just replaced it with more avocado or cucumber.\n\n* BIG ISLAND ($14.95) - 3/5\n[salmon, tuna, albacore & tobiko, snow crab, avocado & sprouts wrapped inside a thinly sliced cucumber; no rice]\nCame with 6 pieces, which was a very small portion given it costed the same as the rolls with 8 pieces.

Fish/sashimi was pretty fresh but I've had better\n\n* FIVE WISHES ($15.95) - 3/5\n[snow crab topped w/ salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served w/ mixed greens and house creamy sauce; no rice]\nPretty much the exact same thing as the Big Island.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-10-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Five Wishes made of snow crab topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served with mixed greens and house creamy sauce (no rice).

I don't have much patience so when it comes to parking, and not being able to find one, it definitely kills my vibe. Although I try to keep my ratings independent of the parking, I would still like to share the pain in finding parking around this area. The first time I came, I rated this location a 4 star, and I loved the food and service. The second time i came, we spent about 20 minutes looking for parking, I would rate the parking a 2/5, saying downtown SF is probably a 1/5. \n\nWe ordered the genmai tea which was 1.5 each, out of a teabag. The tea is great, but service was bad. I had to ask every single time for the server to come and fill my tea. There was never a time where the server decided to check on my tea or us in general to see if we needed anything. It wasn't until when we were almost done and leaving did a nice korean server come by. She checked on us a couple of times and that was appreciated. \n\nThis time around, we ordered complete different items to try out their menu as a whole. We tried two different lettuce wrap, the Solstice and winter. Solstice was composed of diced ahi tuna seared, avocado, crunchy flakes and tabasco sauce for $6.95. Winter was made of spicy tuna, avocado, aioli and shrimp tempura. I have to argue that the winter lettuce wrap was more flavorful. I tried winter first then went to Solstice and it tasted very bland. Each of the lettuce wrap was a few cents off from 7 dollars. In my opinion, I fee like they are over priced for what they are. \n\nWe also ordered 5 wishes which was a popular item off yelp. \n$15.95 Five Wishes made of snow crab topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served with mixed greens and house creamy sauce (no rice). I would rate this a 5/5. This was very fresh and I enjoyed the taste and texture of this. Beautiful picture as well. There was no rice in here. \n\n$14.95 African Spider made of deep-fried soft shell crab, fried albacore and salmon, topped with avocado, sprouts, drizzled with a sweet and spicy eel sauce. I think this was my least favorite because the stuffing inside was pretty thick and hearty. Felt very oily and a bit too much. It was also very salty in the middle too. I would say this is a 3/5. This was a bit too much for me in terms of how heavy it was. I did however enjoy the sauce in this dish. \n\n$12.95 Albacore Dream composed of spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This would probably be a 4/5. This dish was pretty spicy, as it was topped with spicy tabasco like sauce on top. I did like the middle which was the spicy tuna and avocado inside. \n\n\nOverall food is great, service is highly lacked, and parking is horrendous.

So here it goes...\n\nI came here for a dinner date with my favorite boy. We didn't have dinner reservations, but luckily there was a table available for two. Like most restaurants in San Francisco, Sushi Bistro was really small in size. I think they could have used bigger tables, but oh well...we made the best of our tiny table for two. \n\nWe ordered a total of six dishes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=7g90tMXSX7R64KLstEG2yA) and two beers each. What I really didn't like was how our table was so small. We couldn't fit all of our food and our waiter was really terrible with pacing. He kept bringing out plate after plate and I felt very rushed. There was literally no space on our table and instead of giving us some time to enjoy our food, he would stand at our table and wait for us to rearrange the plates somehow so that he could fit the next plate.\n\nOn a lighter note, the sashimi and rolls were fantastic. My most favorite roll of the night was the butter blaster (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=FhSDQZYwjvHQ6-gflkFGcg). It was the most tasteful roll I have ever had. It consisted of snow crab meat and avocado, wrapped with butterfish. The butterfish was very rich and soft--I just couldn't get enough of it. I also really liked the yellowtail belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=BFanUmX0bKFu2R0IpLJh2Q); it was the most rich tasting sashimi I have ever tasted.

Since by definition, there really is no such thing as a sushi bistro, I had my doubts, but those fears subsided once I took a quick look on Yelp and found a four-star rating.\n\nThe place took reservations, which is sometimes a rarity in the city. There's a bar and then like a row of tables alongside one wall. There are also more tables in the back, although I didn't see how many, but I took a quick glance when going to the restroom. \n\nI guess no one eats at 5:30 except for me in the city, so we were immediately seated. They brought us some green tea, with teabags in the cups, which made me wary because you only see that in non-Japanese-owned establishments. Speaking of which, I looked behind the sushi-counter and didn't really see anyone who looked Japanese. Oh well, with almost 1,000 reviews and a four-star average, I had to trust in the system. \n\nFor three of us, we just kept the rolls coming. What was great was that we would order one or two at a time and when they were brought out, we would order another, but there were not huge lulls in between. They came out at just the right pace and our waiter/host was really nice, and then I learned he spoke Mandarin when he was talking to the table next to us, which kind of threw me for a loop.

MEEE, MEEE!\n\nWe came for my bf's best friend's birthday. What a pleasant little surprise hidden in the inner richmond. Unfortunately, it's not a sushi restaurant I could come back to once a week. (Because once a week is how often I would prefer to eat sushi :] but anyway...) Rolls range from about $8 - $14. We were a group of 6 (5 adults, 1 child) and we couldn't decide on what to order for the life of us. Soo, this is how our ordering went:\n\nWaiter: what would you like?\nUs: What are your favorite 3 rolls?\nWaiter: Well, the [blahblah-insert names]\nUs: Can you just order us 10 of your best rolls?\nWaiter: Sure, anything you guys don't eat?\nUs: No california rolls!\nWaiter: Ok, any allergies?\nUs: Nope.\nWaiter: Do you like spicy food?\nUs: Sure!\nWaiter: Okay, I got it.\n\nWell let me tell you that was the start of a good good night! As soon as I had my first bite I started writing down what we ordered just so I could yelp about each dish. Now I'm matching the names I wrote down with the description on their website. Yes, I want you to know exactly how wonderful my meal was. Our order came out:\n\n1 - Butterfish Blasters ($13.95): These were uuuh-mazing! One of my favorites of the night. It is crab meat and avocado wrapped with butterfish. Made a unique and tasty combination that had great flavor and texture!\n\n2 - Original ML ($11.50): Very good and not even on the menu!! (That's how dope our waiter was) This one had baked baby lobster inside- yum!\n\n3 - Dave's Legacy (11.75): Again, not on the menu. This one was another one of my favorites. It had Japanese squash inside.\n\n4 - Spicy Crunchy (9.25): Be careful with this one because it comes out piping hot! I was overly excited by how good everything was that I stuck the whole piece in my mouth. BIg mistake - it was so hot I couldn't thoroughly enjoy it. I think if it would have let it cool I would have liked it better.\n\n5 -Hamache Kama (9.50): had yellowtail inside of it.\n\n6 - Monster in Laws (11.75) This one had some albacore, yellowtail, and even jalapeno in it. \n\n7 - C-2 (11.95): Another favorite of mine! This one had stripped tempura on top of the roll and eel sauce dripped on top, too!\n\n8 - Watermelon man (8.95): It looked like a watermelon piece, how cute! Also, had some mango and macadamia nuts inside it!\n\n9 - Aloha 101 (9.95) - A really original roll. Very fresh tasting and it came with a garlic dipping sauce.\n\n10 - Rock n Roll (7.95) - Not your usual Unagi and avocado rock n roll. This one had baked scallops on top of california roll. I've had this roll better at other restaurants, probably wouldn't order it again. If you like dynamite, this is the roll for you.\n\n11 - African spider (12.50) - The best that a spider roll will ever get! You can get a spider roll anywhere, but this one's on crack and I'm addicted!!!\n\nBy the way, did I mention the complimentary cucumber salad prior to dinner?

But if you're looking for ROLLS in an unconventionally modern, dark and hip sushi restaurant,\nthen this is the place for you.\n\nListed in order of most to least fave rolls we tried:\n1. Butterfish Blasters ($13.95) snow crab and avocado wrapped in butterfish lightly torched with a garlic-soy. Based on the description I expected this dish to be hot but it wasn't. Nevertheless, the fish was soft and it was really nice to bite into the crab and avocado rather than a ball of rice.\n\n2. Hawaiian Breeze ($11.95). Mango, avocado and slivered fuji apple topped with tuna, macadamia nuts and drizzled with cilantro pesto. Totally unexpected flavors from the cilantro and pesto but it gave a very 'fresh' aromatic taste to the sushi. Admittedly I barely tasted the tuna. I caught more of the sweetness from the mango and fuji apples. But I liked the creative use of apples. It worked well with this roll.\n\n3. Albacore Dream  ($11.25). Spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This one had a nice heat to it from the spicy tuna, but the spiciness did overpower the \nalbacore, which I typically like to taste and enjoy.\n\n4. C-2  ($12.95). Baby lobster, avocado and cucumber topped with shrimp tempura, drizzled with sweet eel sauce. The shrimp tempura stayed crunchy on top of the roll but overall had a sweet taste. I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster, which was a shame.\n\n5. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon  ($10.95). Shrimp tempura, avocado & cucumber, all topped with unagi and eel sauce. This one was not memorable except that it was a little too sweet especially since it tasted similar to C-2.\n\n6. Monster in-laws  ($12.95). Spicy albacore and cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce. Visually pleasing with the delicate slices of jalapenos but honestly I tasted a fish that was a bit \"fishy\" and so I couldn't eat any more of it.\n\nWhat Sushi Bistro does well is innovative roll names, easy on the rice (awesome), and heavy on the \"stuff\" to roll into the sushi.

After living here for almost a year, and continually saying I wanted to try this place (mainly after seeing it on the iPhone commercial and know its close by) my roommate put in a reservation for 6 of us.\n\nWe walked over, since parking is a mess in this area and were promptly seated.  This might have been because we were eating at 9pm, but I like not waiting!  Big plus!  The restaurant itself tries to go for like a hip, trendy and almost loungy feel which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your mood.  \n\nSat down and took a look at the menu.  So many crazy choices and interesting names.  I decided to try the Hot Love which consisted of baby lobster, crab meat and some other stuff baked?  Yum.  I didn't know what to expect from \"Something Unique\" but it definitely was.  There were two rolls on there so you can't really expect to get full off of it.  I tried some of my other roommates Magic Mushrooms which was also definitely tasty.  I'm a big mushroom fan though, so some people might not like it.  I also went with the Big Island.  It just sounded like a combination of all the right fishes that I like to eat.  Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail and a few other things, how do they fit it all in a roll!?  No rice, and it was wrapped with a cucumber.  It was refreshing and delicious.  Not completely what I expected, but it was a nice surprise.\n\nThe dishes are a bit on the pricey side, so I wouldn't eat here all the time, but I'll be back for more one day (soon?)", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-07-18"}, {"excerpts": ["YT Jalape\u00f1os - Slices of Yellowtail topped with Jalapenos and Lemon Juice\n6.

Finally I went there last Saturday but it turned out a disappointment.......\n\nWe have ordered:  \n\nSashimi combo (12 pieces) - The fish definitely did not seem fresh and tasteless.  But the pieces were HUGH.  It took me at least three bits to finish one piece.  I think if the fish is fresh, I don't mind the piece is smaller.\n\nThen we ordered some of the dishes from their \"Something Unique\" section:\n\n1.  Double Jeopardy - Chopped Jeopardy - Chopped Salmon, Albacore & Avocado served spicy sauce\n2.  Hot Love - Baby Lobster, Avocado and crab meant rolled in Snapper and baked with special sweet sauce\n3.  Butterfish Blasters - Crab Meat and avocado wrapped in Butterfish with soy sauce\n4.  Spicy Girl - Avocado wrapped with spicy White Tuna, Macadamia nut served on sauce\n5.  YT Jalape\u00f1os - Slices of Yellowtail topped with Jalapenos and Lemon Juice\n6.  Scallop Supreme - Seared Scallop served with Edamame Sauce\n\n**The presentation of the dishes were all nice but they were all tasted the so-so, nothing was special.  I don't recommend any dishes from here.\n\nSince we wanted some rice so we ordered some Nigiri Sushi and a roll, we ordered Hamachi, Uni, Salmon and Couching Tiger and Hiding Dragon Roll.  Again the fish did not seem fresh and the piece was HUGH on top of the tiny rice.  Actually I should not complain with that but I think the proportation of the rice and the cut of the fish should be well balance.  It was just too off here!  The CTHD roll was actually Dragon Roll.  The rice was too sticky (too much water) and too much sauce, nothing special on this one! again.  \n\nAnother thing that made me dislike the place was the service.  In the beginning, the service was pretty good.  Fast and Friendly.  But later we felt like they were trying to rush us out to give our table to the next group.

The staff was pleasant and accommodating when my tourist friends went to the sushi bar to watch the chef at work...  Our food came out quick and we were attended to promptly when our dishes were empty and we were ready for more...\n\nNow for the food... it's not that it wasn't good - I've had rolls of the same quality before.  I overlooked half the menu though, because I noticed many were \"fusion\" type rolls.  I'm all for artistry and creativity, but when it's come to sushi, I've lucked out with finding anything good in the \"fusion\" department.  I usually steer clear of those, because I know that it's just a bunch of fluff that will confuse my tastebuds more than satisfy me.  \n\nMoving on... the spicy tuna rolls were super.  I had something with Yellowtail in it, but I can't put my finger on the name because it's been a while since my visit, and it was ok.\n\nMy guests had the spider rolls, and apparently, my friend from Turkey had never known that soft shell crab existed...  The idea of eating the whole damned thing boggled her mind., but once she got her first taste, she quickly made haste to flag down a server and make sure I order her another portion.  That MUST mean something.  \n\nMy native SF friends helping me play tour guide had the sashimi plates, and they looked incredibly good.  Thick, fatty morsels of vibrant bits of fish... I had to look away while they ate to make sure I did not commit the sin of coveting the contents on my neighbor's plate.  I'm definitely going to try what they had if ever I am in the area again.\n\n3.5 stars... good and fresh, but I really have to work the \"fusion\" idea into my head one more time to be adventurous here, and the staff did a wonderful job making sure we had everything we needed for the night.  A small part of this rating could have been higher if it weren't for the smell that I noticed from the paint off-gassing.

They also had the Sexy Scallop and Spicy Crunchy rolls. \n\nMy biggest complaint has to be after eating half of all our rolls, they all started tasting the same. You could literally close your eyes, pick a roll at random and eat it and have no idea what you just ate. Herein lies my disappointment. With so much fresh fish at his disposal and so much obvious creative aptitude, the chef could have really come up with some distinct flavor profiles. If anything, I thought he was a little heavy-handed with the sriracha.

My 2 pieces end up being 4 pieces.  One time I went with 3 of my girlfriends and in unison we all said \"Mmmmmmmmmm....\" out loud after taking a bite of the Yellowtail piece.  The people sitting next to us turned around, giggled, and ordered the same thing.\n\nThis place has consistently been a crowd pleaser.  Everytime I take a new person here they love it.  Special note to Vegetarians - they have a good selection of veggie-type rolls.  Not just your usual cucumber or avocado ones!  The music is cool too. They play reggae which gives it a chill, island vibe. \n\nP.S.

So here it goes...\n\nI came here for a dinner date with my favorite boy. We didn't have dinner reservations, but luckily there was a table available for two. Like most restaurants in San Francisco, Sushi Bistro was really small in size. I think they could have used bigger tables, but oh well...we made the best of our tiny table for two. \n\nWe ordered a total of six dishes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=7g90tMXSX7R64KLstEG2yA) and two beers each. What I really didn't like was how our table was so small. We couldn't fit all of our food and our waiter was really terrible with pacing. He kept bringing out plate after plate and I felt very rushed. There was literally no space on our table and instead of giving us some time to enjoy our food, he would stand at our table and wait for us to rearrange the plates somehow so that he could fit the next plate.\n\nOn a lighter note, the sashimi and rolls were fantastic. My most favorite roll of the night was the butter blaster (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=FhSDQZYwjvHQ6-gflkFGcg). It was the most tasteful roll I have ever had. It consisted of snow crab meat and avocado, wrapped with butterfish. The butterfish was very rich and soft--I just couldn't get enough of it. I also really liked the yellowtail belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=BFanUmX0bKFu2R0IpLJh2Q); it was the most rich tasting sashimi I have ever tasted.

Such a tender roll with a rich blast of flavor. But I warn against the Hot Love (baby lobster, avocado and crab meat rolled in  snapper, baked with spicy sweet sauce). Sounds so good on the menu...but it is drenched in thick, overpowering orange sauce, the \"crab meat\" inside the roll is fake, and I don't know what is wrapped around the outside but it has a really rubbery texture...the whole roll is just overwhelming and wrong. Order unique rolls at your own risk!\n\nThe menu also includes vegetarian rolls, brown rice rolls, signature rolls, small plates, teriyaki, udon, and salads. \n\nYou will swoon over the sashimi (and non-ridiculous wait for a table unlike at some tiny sushi establishments).", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-04"}, {"excerpts": ["I would probably give this place 2 stars if it were not for their very good albacore belly."], "author": "Margaret S.", "review": "Le meh. \n\nI should not have to ask to hear the specials, for one. \n\nN\u00famero dos, a staple in sushi joints like akami maguro should not make me recoil because it has a fishy taste.\n\nThe rolls omega 3 and butterfish blaster was just okay.

The ratings looked great but it's a shame when Yelp fails me.\n\nMy first impression was that the restaurant ambience was a bit disorderly. There was some sort of reggae/rock music playing and sports playing on TV. The plates on our tables were all different colors and sizes. Some were triangular, others rectangular, some were round, and some were curved upwards on the edges. My serving plate was blue and my boyfriend's was yellow. Visually, it made the experience a less appetizing.\n\nAs for the food, if you like avocado come here. We tried several different rolls, but I felt like each one was an avocado roll.\n\nDouble Jeopardy - This is described as a tartare, but I felt like I was eating a guacamole, that happened to have bits of fish in it. There was just so much avocado filling up the dish. I liked the use of the shrimp chips and the flavors I got when I wasn't eating mouthfuls of avocado.\n\nDrunken Halibut - The halibut was a bit overcooked for my liking. It was a very average dish.\n\nUni Nigiri - Very average quality uni. It's not bad, but it doesn't do uni much justice either. \n\nFive Wishes - The presentation was very unappetizing. The house sauce was all over the plate and it just looked messy. I appreciate that real crab was used, but this dish was almost inedible. Something about the flavor was just off. We just ate the salmon and pieces off the tops of the rolls. Again, there was too much avocado. It said that the rolls were topped but a mixture of fish, but two of the cuts were entirely topped with avocado.\n\nSashimi spirit - I did not taste the spirit of sahimi in this one.

To put it briefly BLAND and boring despite their sauce efforts.  Last came the special roll of the day which had marinated seared fatty tuna on top with tempura asparagus, and other stuff inside.  It was presented on a plate with pesto sauce.  I was looking forward to this roll because it had Fatty Tuna, but it turned into a disappointing mess of flavors -- I had no idea what I was tasting.  All that flavor made it pointless to use fatty tuna on top -- they could use halibut, or yellow tail and it would taste the same and the roll would've been cheaper.\n\nAnyways, summary: I felt all there rolls were too done up with sauces.  Most of their rolls are cooked too so if you're a fan of raw fish and subtle taste, I recommend K's Kitchen on Monterey which has unique and fancy rolls with flavors that actually work together without being overpowering.  You'll be spending the same for better food.  If you prefer more cooked rolls, I think Kiki's or Kitaro's or a sushi boat have similar stuff for half the price.  You're basically paying for the atmosphere and better grade of fish (if you order the raw fish).  \n\nAtmosphere:  to loud.

I love that they play reggae as well. That was a big plus for my bf. He was more inclined to going out for sushi when he found that out. For people who do not like raw fish, they have a good selection of deep fried goodies to choose from. Personally i go for the raw stuff, and sushi Bistro was definitely fresh, fresh, fresh. They also give big honking pieces of nigiri and sashimi. I almost kissed the sushi chef. The more fish the better. My favorite was the halibut sashimi. We got a few orders of that.
