Yet in modern day America, it's not cheap at all. It's not expensive, but it's comparable to restaurants that cater to the take out crowd. Which food trucks basically do, but without having all of the expenses and regulatory requirements of a real brick and mortar restaurant.\n\nWith that said, I finally tried Japacurry. I've walked by it a million times over on Mission/2nd, but never felt compelled to try it. I was planning to go to get a sandwich, but the thought of curry intrigued me. So I walked up and ordered a karaage curry, surrendered 8 bucks, and was on my way. Found a nice place to sit and though the food was decent. Not bad, not great, but just decent.\n\nThe karaage was a bit tough and stringy and each piece was far too large to be a mouthful. Do not plan on looking elegant while eating this, as you will need to bite pieces off with your teeth, because they don't supply plastic knives. The stringiness of the chicken doesn't help. Flavor was just fine, however.\n\nThe curry was just okay. I asked for spicy, and they basically just sprinkle more chile pepper powder on it. It wasn't bad, and it will definitely satisfy a curry craving, but it was really quite ordinary.\n\nOddly, they served a bed of shredded cabbage with the rice and karaage, which I thought was strange. Shredded cabbage is often served with tonkatsu, but never with katsu curry. I ordered karaage, which is even stranger with cabbage. Perhaps they're confused, or maybe just creative. Ha. I don't find the cabbage to be objectionable, but thought I'd mention this just cuz.\n\nNot sure if I'll be back. Much better options in the city.
