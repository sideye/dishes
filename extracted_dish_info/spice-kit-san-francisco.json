I thought the pickles in the sandwich felt a bit harsh (compared to what you get at other nearby Viet places).  I def enjoyed and preferred my Korean bowl.\n\nWe also got two pork bao cause I read good reviews for it.  The boas are kind of small, so 2 for $5 is reasonable.

Only one of the basic banh mi ingredients was missing: the liver pate - it costs 75 cents EXTRA (nickel and dime schemes annoy me). I guess people who dislike pate won't mind this. Why short change customers? Most banh mi shops in SF include pate by default, no extra charges to jack up the price. Maybe they think that downtown office workers don't know any better.\n\nThis ssam was like a Korean burrito - Korean meat, kimchee, veggies and rice wrapped in Viet rice paper, http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/28nYWTQOqaKFDzQR3hYdfQ/l, though the one I got was very poorly wrapped. It was open on the bottom, almost fell apart as soon as I tried to lift it. You're supposed to eat ssam with your hands (real ssam is like the Chinese lettuce cups dish). Clearly the kitchen staff needs more practice or better training. There was a lot of kimchee, not enough meat, and the rice was a little overcooked. This was just their first week open. Not impressed. I suggest that they offer a rice plate option instead, it'd be easier for the kitchen staff to assemble.\n\nThe pork bun (2.95 or 2/$5) was another let down. The meat portion was minimal and that pork belly was soggy and thin. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-1w_AE5ViUPY5z5He_mqlA/l Hoisin sauce was fine, but the tiny portion looked really sad. It reminded me of that famous \"Where's the Beef?\" commercial. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug75diEyiA0 My suggestion to improve that: fry that pork belly (thicker cut, and careful not to overcook it), so u get a slightly crispy texture, saltiness, and better contrast. AND put more meat on that bun!!\n\nThis food concept has good potential, so I hope that this review is helpful in pointing out the issues that need to be addressed.\n\nOther side dishes on the menu are Lotus chips ($1.50, called \"renkon chips\" elsewhere) and a ginger-peanut slaw ($1.95).\n\nI did recognize that all the meats I sampled were very tender and moist.

My (lunch) future's so bright, I've gotta wear bibs!  \n\nSpice kit is a treasure.  Historically, I've passed on the Vietnamese sandwich.  I'm just not a big sandwich guy.  When you decrease the cleanliness factor and add some carrots and cucumbers as per the norm at most purveyors, my midday gusto becomes something akin to George Costanza after a cold swim.

There are couple other options, but they keep it pretty straightforward.  Thank you Chipotle model!  \n\nMy first encounter with the bahn-mi, was predominately shaped on recommendation.  It was a delicious French roll, topped w/ greens, sliced jalapeno, chicken, cucumber, carrots, cilantro and a little mayo.  I added the optional Pate.  I'm not even sure how to describe it.  Pure delicious.  The chicken is just the right warmth to slightly heat up the veggies so that everything is that perfect temp a sandwich should be and all the different flavors come together well.  I like adding a little sri-racha to kick things up a touch.\n\nThe real gem though is the ssam, which is the lovechild of a spring roll and a burrito.  Check it:   rice paper wrap, red leaf lettuce, kimchi, marinated sprouts, rice, cucumber and your choice of meat filling.  At first, I thought it sounded crazy, but it was so DAAAMNED good.

Next time I went I mentioned this to the owner, and he gave me lunch on the house - now THAT is a sign that they take their customers seriously.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-09-09"}, {"excerpts": ["The concept is simple: choose a sandwich, wrap, or salad as the platform and then choose a protein.

I'm glad we hit this place our first night, as it would become a go-to choice from the rest of the trip. The concept is simple: choose a sandwich, wrap, or salad as the platform and then choose a protein. We had two b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches, one with roasted pork and one with beef shortribs. This was my first foray into b\u00e1nh m\u00ec territory. It's a Vietnamese sandwich traditionally garnished with liver pate, mayonnaise, a slaw of pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber, and cilantro. The shortribs weren't bad, but the roasted pork was perfect. The acid in the slaw cuts through the fat of the pate and pork and adds a nice, bright note. I have had dreams about that pork b\u00e1nh m\u00ec since then, and have already located a recipe for pate that I want to try making soon. If Out the Door didn't have proximity going for it, I suspect Spice Kit would have become our default choice for a quick meal.\n\nWe also ordered some steamed pork buns. My experience with the dish in the past has been a soft, pillowy dough which completely surrounded a chopped pork filling similar to what you might find in an egg roll, only a bit sweeter. The Spice Kit take on them is a grilled slab of pork belly basted with hoisin and some veggies. They were delicious, but I'll admit that I was far too enamored with the b\u00e1nh m\u00ec to get terribly excited about them. For those keeping score at home, roasted pork + pate is greater than pork belly alone.\n\nWe also got an order of the ginger peanut slaw to share.

Another thought, it would have been nice if the bread had been toasted to give the sandwich some crunch to contrast with the other ingredients. The lotus chips are advertised as \"crispy\" but mine were a bit chewy. Is it that they were not freshly fried? I don't know. Not inspired to try them again since they also lacked flavor. Second trip I tried the wrap with beef. Again, flavors were good, however I found the wrap a bit unwieldy and eventually just had to use a fork because it was turning into a mess.

Sure it's a little expensive, but so is just about everything else around there and they use pretty high quality ingredients.  So, in response to some yelpers,  you would pay this much for americanized-korean/vietnamese food because you:\n\n1. need a quick , yet satisfying lunch;\n2. can't go to those Vietnamese places you actually love (Ba Le in El Cerrito is my favorite!); and,\n3. are tired of eating salads and sandwiches. \n\nI have tried the beef shortribs, pork and tofu ssams (I haven't been able to bring myself to paying $7-$8 for a banh mi just yet), the salad with five-spice chicken, the pork buns and the lotus chips.  Here are my thoughts/opinions:\n\n1.Ssams: If you are trying to look at all dignified, I would recommend that you eat the ssam with a knife and fork rather than like a burrito because it always falls apart by the end (at least for me...perhaps there are more graceful eaters than I out there).  The beef shortribs were juicier and more flavorful than the pork.  The tofu seemed saltier than the meats.  You can also customize the ssam to ask for more/less veggies, rice or sauce.  Warning, the more veggies / sauce you put in and less rice, the more likely it is to fall apart.\n2. Salad with five-spice chicken: The salad was lightly dressed and the chicken chunks were very tender.  I wish there was less salt and more flavor on the chicken (salt doesn't equal flavor in my book).\n3. Pork buns: The pork buns were terrible.  The bun was dry and the cucumbers didn't taste properly pickled.  I definitely wouldn't get that again.  \n4. Lotus chips: The lotus chips were thinly sliced and crispy, but nothing special.  They tasted basically like lightly salted chips.  You should dip them in sriracha sauce if you're looking for a little more flavor.  \n\nThere are a few small tables outside and about 5 tables for 2 inside.

But its all the little things they get right that makes this sandwich.  The bread is perfectly soft yet crunchy.  The pickled veggies give great crunch and acid.  And that pate - well you've got to try it to understand.\n- Pork buns - like others have said, these things are super tasty.  Pork belly is cooked just perfect.  And the bun has that right hint of sweetness and chewiness.  Momofuku's got nothing on these guys.\n- Calamansi Lime-ade - Never had this before but I'm hooked now.  Everytime I go in now they have one ready for me.\n- Tofu Salad - okok, those that know me will find this surprising since I'm usually not a salad guy or a tofu guy.  But a friend convinced me it was worth trying and I gotta say, I'm a convert.  I probably wouldn't have gained those 20 pounds if salads tasted this good all the time.  And the tofu isn't plain white tofu.  Its the fried kind you get in Chinese claypots and its perfect in the salad.\n\nAlso the staff is super super friendly, the space is bright, clean and airy,  and they're pretty quick even during the lunch time rush.  \n\nOn a personal note, its a pet peeve of mine when people compare places like this to a $3 banh mi shop a la Saigon Sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, I love Saigon Sandwich and cheap taquerias too.  But they're not sous vide-ing top quality proteins, making homemade pate, or using super fresh organic veggies.

So excited I wasted little time and had lunch there on Tuesday.\n\nI managed to get in and get my food order in just before the afternoon lunch rush.  I wanted to try a little of everything so I ordered the Roasted Pork banh mi, a Steamed Pork (belly) Bun, Lotus Chips and a Calamansi Lime-ade.  The wait for food was actually surprisingly fast.\n\nThere is seating inside for about 20 with additional seating outside.  I grabbed an indoor seat and dug in.  I started with a sip of the Calamansi Lime-ade, and it was very refreshing.  It's taste was not very lime-like though, but it was definitely citrusy with just a tinge of tartness.\n\nThe Steamed Pork Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#jOb0-QlFTTW-R7RNKuuxVA) was very good.  I got two rather large pieces of pork belly in mine.  Thinly sliced cucumber, sweetened hoisin sauce and chopped green onion accompany the meat inside a steamed clamshell bun.  The pork belly was soft and tender and had very good flavor.  \n\nI liked the Lotus Chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#_mjb6qgySqyI3jUa3BBlcg) a lot.  I've often had lotus root in soups and stir-frys, but this was my first time experiencing it sliced and deep fried.  More accurately the lotus root is shaved super thin, deep-fried then lightly salted.  The result was super crispy chips that seemed very light even after the frying oil soaked into the root.\n\nThe portion of meat in the Roasted Pork Banh Mi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#kAHTEjgTR6W8Imomg2dpAg) was very generous.  I ordered it with pate which costs extra.  This was definitely one of the pricier Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had, but aside from the cost I thought this was very good too.  I wasn't very fond of the drippy mayo, but the ingredients were very fresh.  The crunchy vegetables include pickled carrots and daikon, thinly sliced cucumber, jalapeno pepper slices and fresh cilantro.  I do wish there were more of the latter two ingredients especially the cilantro which they seemed to skimp on.  The pate was quite flavorful as was the roast pork which was moist and tender with nice charred spots on the outside.  The sandwich was served on a fresh, chewy roll that was nice and crusty.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try the beef short ribs and the five spice chicken.

Way better than those cheap joints that just microwave some tough pork.\n\nSsam: Shouldn't this be called ssambap since there is rice inside?  A light lettuce wrap with your protein choice (pick shortribs), rice, kimchi and some other veggies all encompassed by a huge rice paper wrap.  I don't believe traditional ssams use rice paper, but this did help make it more manageable to eat at a desk.  Kind of like a super-sized summer roll.\n\nBanh Mi: I like that the baguette is closer to a baguette than most of those fat hoagie rolls around town.  However, I still feel Lee's has the best bread.  Could have been spicier.  The pickled veggies were standard.  The p\u00e2t\u00e9 was totally worth the 75 cent add-on since it was of French charcuterie plate quality as opposed to that cheap spread stuff you get in Little Saigon.\n\nPork Bun: It's great that places in San Francisco are catching on to the bun sandwich finally.  The pork belly was nice and tender with good glaze, but could have been crisped a bit more.  The pickled cucumber slices were a nice crunch contrast.  Kind of small though.\n\nLotus Chips: Yummy!

Sure it's a little expensive, but so is just about everything else around there and they use pretty high quality ingredients.  So, in response to some yelpers,  you would pay this much for americanized-korean/vietnamese food because you:\n\n1. need a quick , yet satisfying lunch;\n2. can't go to those Vietnamese places you actually love (Ba Le in El Cerrito is my favorite!); and,\n3. are tired of eating salads and sandwiches. \n\nI have tried the beef shortribs, pork and tofu ssams (I haven't been able to bring myself to paying $7-$8 for a banh mi just yet), the salad with five-spice chicken, the pork buns and the lotus chips.

The beef shortribs were juicier and more flavorful than the pork.  The tofu seemed saltier than the meats.  You can also customize the ssam to ask for more/less veggies, rice or sauce.  Warning, the more veggies / sauce you put in and less rice, the more likely it is to fall apart.\n2. Salad with five-spice chicken: The salad was lightly dressed and the chicken chunks were very tender.  I wish there was less salt and more flavor on the chicken (salt doesn't equal flavor in my book).\n3. Pork buns: The pork buns were terrible.  The bun was dry and the cucumbers didn't taste properly pickled.  I definitely wouldn't get that again.  \n4. Lotus chips: The lotus chips were thinly sliced and crispy, but nothing special.  They tasted basically like lightly salted chips.  You should dip them in sriracha sauce if you're looking for a little more flavor.  \n\nThere are a few small tables outside and about 5 tables for 2 inside.

Forgo the pate!  Though it's house made, I think it's overkill with the beef - it might be better with the roasted pork.

I give Spice Kit props for making the fish sauce correctly, and not skimping on the flavor. I do get that fish sauce is a bit intimating because of the salty fishy taste, Spice Kit carried that flavor by combing some sweet and spicy flavors to it, like the usual fish sauce you would get from Vietnamese places, except it's a bit more on the thicker side, which complements the rice bowl perfectly.\n\nProbably a go-to place for a quick bit to eat, and the entire meal costing me under $11 is always a plus.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-06-29"}, {"excerpts": ["This paired with the short rib rice bowl, lotus chips, and limeade is my favorite lunch combination.

I wanted to try a little of everything so I ordered the Roasted Pork banh mi, a Steamed Pork (belly) Bun, Lotus Chips and a Calamansi Lime-ade.  The wait for food was actually surprisingly fast.\n\nThere is seating inside for about 20 with additional seating outside.  I grabbed an indoor seat and dug in.  I started with a sip of the Calamansi Lime-ade, and it was very refreshing.  It's taste was not very lime-like though, but it was definitely citrusy with just a tinge of tartness.\n\nThe Steamed Pork Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#jOb0-QlFTTW-R7RNKuuxVA) was very good.  I got two rather large pieces of pork belly in mine.  Thinly sliced cucumber, sweetened hoisin sauce and chopped green onion accompany the meat inside a steamed clamshell bun.  The pork belly was soft and tender and had very good flavor.  \n\nI liked the Lotus Chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#_mjb6qgySqyI3jUa3BBlcg) a lot.  I've often had lotus root in soups and stir-frys, but this was my first time experiencing it sliced and deep fried.  More accurately the lotus root is shaved super thin, deep-fried then lightly salted.  The result was super crispy chips that seemed very light even after the frying oil soaked into the root.\n\nThe portion of meat in the Roasted Pork Banh Mi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#kAHTEjgTR6W8Imomg2dpAg) was very generous.  I ordered it with pate which costs extra.  This was definitely one of the pricier Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had, but aside from the cost I thought this was very good too.  I wasn't very fond of the drippy mayo, but the ingredients were very fresh.  The crunchy vegetables include pickled carrots and daikon, thinly sliced cucumber, jalapeno pepper slices and fresh cilantro.  I do wish there were more of the latter two ingredients especially the cilantro which they seemed to skimp on.  The pate was quite flavorful as was the roast pork which was moist and tender with nice charred spots on the outside.  The sandwich was served on a fresh, chewy roll that was nice and crusty.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try the beef short ribs and the five spice chicken.

I think ratings will vary depending on what u ordered, and how well the food is prepared. I expected better from former French Laundry and Ritz Carlton cooks.\n\nThis Asian (Viet-Korean-Chinese) concept is modeled after the Chipotle chain, but prices are slightly more expensive. They have a list of proteins (\"ingredients\" - chicken, beef, pork, tofu) that u can order as a ban mi sandwich, a Korean burrito, or a salad. Plus a few side dishes and asian drinks. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t6ad76DjjInmQAiMn_k0rQ/l\n\nThe Thai iced tea was perfect, not overly sweet, well made. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DMpFLDIqJNzp9bvMPO5vXw/l\n\nThe sandwich was good overall. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wD_zm-2p9aY3tUAUF0WZUA/l Good crunchy baguette bread, the pickled veggies were crunchy but a bit mild for me, and the meat was tender and flavorful. Only one of the basic banh mi ingredients was missing: the liver pate - it costs 75 cents EXTRA (nickel and dime schemes annoy me). I guess people who dislike pate won't mind this. Why short change customers? Most banh mi shops in SF include pate by default, no extra charges to jack up the price. Maybe they think that downtown office workers don't know any better.\n\nThis ssam was like a Korean burrito - Korean meat, kimchee, veggies and rice wrapped in Viet rice paper, http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/28nYWTQOqaKFDzQR3hYdfQ/l, though the one I got was very poorly wrapped. It was open on the bottom, almost fell apart as soon as I tried to lift it. You're supposed to eat ssam with your hands (real ssam is like the Chinese lettuce cups dish). Clearly the kitchen staff needs more practice or better training. There was a lot of kimchee, not enough meat, and the rice was a little overcooked. This was just their first week open. Not impressed. I suggest that they offer a rice plate option instead, it'd be easier for the kitchen staff to assemble.\n\nThe pork bun (2.95 or 2/$5) was another let down. The meat portion was minimal and that pork belly was soggy and thin. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-1w_AE5ViUPY5z5He_mqlA/l Hoisin sauce was fine, but the tiny portion looked really sad. It reminded me of that famous \"Where's the Beef?\" commercial. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug75diEyiA0 My suggestion to improve that: fry that pork belly (thicker cut, and careful not to overcook it), so u get a slightly crispy texture, saltiness, and better contrast. AND put more meat on that bun!!\n\nThis food concept has good potential, so I hope that this review is helpful in pointing out the issues that need to be addressed.\n\nOther side dishes on the menu are Lotus chips ($1.50, called \"renkon chips\" elsewhere) and a ginger-peanut slaw ($1.95).\n\nI did recognize that all the meats I sampled were very tender and moist. That's because this is the first quick service shop in SF that uses sous-vide techniques to slow-cook their meats in vacuum bags (normally only found at fine dining restaurants).\n\nNapkins, plastic utensils and sriracha hot sauce are available next to the soda machine.\n\nThis somewhat hidden shop is located on the open plaza of the Orrick Building.

A light lettuce wrap with your protein choice (pick shortribs), rice, kimchi and some other veggies all encompassed by a huge rice paper wrap.

So come out and support Spice Kit; with growing support, Spice Kit can become the next (Asian-form of) Chipotle!?\n\nAs for their food, Spice Kit serves banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), ssam (Korean/Vietnamese wraps/spring rolls), and salads with your choice of Five Spice Chicken, Short Ribs, Roasted Pork, Vegetarian, or Roasted Pork Belly with their own respective prices $6-$8 (similar to Chipotle).

I could have found yummier and cheaper else where but it was good for an Americanized attempt at authentic banh mi. \n\nThe ssam (traditionally a Korean Wrap of meat&kimchi in lettuce) reminded me of an Asian burrito with Korean and Vietnamese influences.. it was cucumber, red leaf lettuce, rice, choice of meat, bean sprouts, kimchi, and some sauce in rice paper.. it was pretty satisfying and I would definitely get it again.\n\nThe pork buns were reminiscent of pecking duck but with grilled pork belly (which was cooked perfectly and tasted great!) and cucumbers, scallions, and hoisin sauce.

Sure it's a little expensive, but so is just about everything else around there and they use pretty high quality ingredients.  So, in response to some yelpers,  you would pay this much for americanized-korean/vietnamese food because you:\n\n1. need a quick , yet satisfying lunch;\n2. can't go to those Vietnamese places you actually love (Ba Le in El Cerrito is my favorite!); and,\n3. are tired of eating salads and sandwiches. \n\nI have tried the beef shortribs, pork and tofu ssams (I haven't been able to bring myself to paying $7-$8 for a banh mi just yet), the salad with five-spice chicken, the pork buns and the lotus chips.  Here are my thoughts/opinions:\n\n1.Ssams: If you are trying to look at all dignified, I would recommend that you eat the ssam with a knife and fork rather than like a burrito because it always falls apart by the end (at least for me...perhaps there are more graceful eaters than I out there).  The beef shortribs were juicier and more flavorful than the pork.  The tofu seemed saltier than the meats.  You can also customize the ssam to ask for more/less veggies, rice or sauce.  Warning, the more veggies / sauce you put in and less rice, the more likely it is to fall apart.\n2. Salad with five-spice chicken: The salad was lightly dressed and the chicken chunks were very tender.  I wish there was less salt and more flavor on the chicken (salt doesn't equal flavor in my book).\n3. Pork buns: The pork buns were terrible.  The bun was dry and the cucumbers didn't taste properly pickled.  I definitely wouldn't get that again.  \n4. Lotus chips: The lotus chips were thinly sliced and crispy, but nothing special.  They tasted basically like lightly salted chips.  You should dip them in sriracha sauce if you're looking for a little more flavor.  \n\nThere are a few small tables outside and about 5 tables for 2 inside.
