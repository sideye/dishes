Was a bit too dry and too salty even for me, a person who would sneak into my grandma's car to lick the salt block she kept in the trunk to weigh down the back half of the car as a child.\n\n\\\\ Imperial Rolls - Pork, mushroom, carrots, lightly fried, served with fresh vegetables & fish sauce. Again, these were just ok. A little too dry for my tastes. \n\n\\\\ Tofu Eggplant - Bean curd, eggplant, bell peppers in soy sauce, served with rice. It was just fine but not a standout dish by any means. \n\nDrink:\n\\\\ Young Coconut - So freaking good. Served in the coconut, so fresh and only $4. Def helped cure my hangover from the night before.\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I can't.

My friend was telling me that it was recently remodeled - which make sense since the pictures and food mentioned in past Yelp reviews do not resemble what I saw during my visit.\n\nRegardless, the \"new version\" of Le Soleil is fab!  It's so chic and modern yet not overly pretentious at all.  I know it sounds sort of absurd to love a restaurant's restroom but I really do appreciate the cleanliness and simple decor.  You can always tell how sanitary a restaurant is by its restroom.  As a germaphobe, I was pleased :)\n\nLet's move on to the food!  If you check in on Yelp, you get free spring rolls!  My friend and I opted for the BBQ pork spring rolls.  They were the smallest portions I have ever seen, but I think it might be because they were free. \n\nFor entree, I had the Five Spice Chicken w/ Brown Rice.  What I love about the chicken was that it was perfectly crispy around the edges and super juicy on the inside.  I took a bite of my friend's Shaken Beef and it was equally comparable to my dish.  The beef was so tender that it melted in my mouth.  I dunked it in the lemon pepper dipping sauce which gave it a nice tang. \n\nI recommend also getting a side of garlic noodles to share.  If you love eggs, then you'll absolutely love these garlic noodles.  There are chunks of garlic and eggs goodness buttered all over each strand of noodle.  So yummy!\n\nAs if we didn't already stuff our faces enough, we were tempted by the dessert selection and ordered the Fried Bananas w/ Coconut Ice Cream.  No regrets there!  The warm, gooey texture of the bananas were so complimentary to the freshness of the coconut ice cream.

You could find me at Loi's, PPQ Noodle House, or Pho Huynh Hiep (Kevin's Noodle House) getting a nice facial over a hot steaming bowl of pho, face shoveling into a combo rice plate or getting buzzed off Vietnamese iced coffee. \n\nWith age, came my intolerance to MSG and caffeine along with a couple of crow's feet, aching knees, and bladder leakage that will soon be in need of Depends. Not to mention passing out in front of the TV even before the guest list opens up at most clubs. Ohhh if only I can be 21 again. \n\nAnyhow, back to food talk because who doesn't love taking about food? :)\n\nThese days, I rarely if ever eat Vietnamese food because of the MSG. Yes, I know it's a staple in Asian cuisine but my body can no longer tolerate it so it makes it difficult to enjoy most Asian cuisine and the wallet-friendly prices. \n\nA rarity, Le Soleil serves upscale MSG-FREE Vietnamese cuisine with French influences. If you're looking for pho, please go somewhere else. It's ridiculous to complain that Le Soleil only has one pho option; they're not Pho 99. However, if you're looking to tantalize your taste buds with unique Vietnamese cuisine made with top-notch ingredients then Le Soleil is the place for you. \n\nThe menu is fairly limited at just 22 items for dinner but with you can make special requests ahead of time with Chef Dennis (24-48 hour in advance so he can buy the ingredients) who's a super nice guy. His specialties on the menu includes Flamb\u00e9ed Quail, Caramelized Sea Bass, and Roasted Garlic Dungeness Crab. They also have brown rice. Yay!\n\nWe started with the Beef Carpaccio ($8). Sorry, no pic for this app since my phone decided to not share this deliciousness with you and deleted the pic *shakes fist*. The tender slices of filet mignon was lightly dressed in a citrus, mint, and chili concoction and served alongside a basket of freshly fried thick shrimp chips (not that stale, flimsy cheap shit at Chinese restaurants). A real solid starter. \n\nThe Bo Luc Lac: Shaking Beef ($16) came next; spelled \"shaken\" on the menu. We added an egg on request (+$2) and it came on a sizzling platter which reminded me of Filipino sisig: http://bit.ly/186ePRX. Just when I thought I tasted the best bo luc lac at Bodega Bistro in TL, a bite of the mouth-wateringly buttery bo luc lac made me realized the BEST has been hidden here at Le Soleil. Not a dish I wanted to share, I'll tell you that much. \n\nAll heads turned when the gargantuan Garlic Roasted Crab w/ Egg Noodles ($32) was placed on our table for two: http://bit.ly/18TBgMz. Insanely fresh, the crab was delicately tender and ohh sooo sweet. The bits of garlic infused just enough garlickyness without leaving us with major dragon breath. The innards of the crab was then mixed with the egg noodles for an artery-clogging carb fest. My only gripe was the noodles; it was more mushy and I like my noodles al-dente with a toothsome chew. Perhaps a thicker noodle would have fared better? \n\nI know people want to know if Le Soleil's crab is as good as PPQ or Thanh Long and there's really no comparison as both PPQ and Thanh Long uses tons of MSG to flavor their signature crab dishes. As I've said, that's like comparing real tits to fake ones. Don't get me wrong, I like fake ones too and I would get a pair to fix my lopsided ones but there's really no comparison.\n\nBecause it's not a complete dinner without dessert (especially when dining out), we wanted to order the Tempura Ice Cream but one of the waitresses brought us the Trio of Ice Cream. When we told her we had ordered the Tempura Ice Cream she said they didn't have it. We instead requested the Fried Bananas with Ice Cream ($4.50) which was tempura battered bananas served with coconut ice cream (sorry, no pic). Huh? They had the tempura batter for the bananas but not for the ice cream? This made no sense. \n\nAside from this minor blunder, service was very friendly and attentive. A smile goes a long way which most Asian restaurants don't seem to get. But Le Soleil does. All smiles here--thank you!\n\nAlong with the atypical Vietnamese fare and good service, Le Soleil has a very contemporary and more upscale ambiance which makes it great for dates. Beware of the terrible parking situation in this area though. \n\nEverything about Le Soleil seems to warrant almost 5 stars. So why just 4? I asked if Chef Dennis can replicate Brodard's FAMOUS Nem Nuong Cuon in SoCal: http://bit.ly/1g5JNyD and he says he can with advanced notice. Going to hold out on that one extra star until I can meet my beloved crack rolls without travelling 400+ miles. If he can deliver, I will gladly upgrade to 5 stars with a big smooch on the face!

"], "author": "Ken K.", "review": "Those of you who have lived in the SF Bay Area and through the 1980s/90s will no doubt remember the famous Thanh Long restaurant (which spun its high end counterpart Crustacean) along with a few copycats or competitors offering somewhat similar fare. I cannot speak for Vietnamese expats and how they view this sort of fare, but they have taken some traditional and not so traditional receipes, and figured out a way to make the best use of local/American ingredients and made it into their signature dish (garlic butter roasted Dungeness crab). It's easy to say on one hand that it's Vietnamese style moo shoo poo poo doo doo...but it's not cheap for one thing!\n\nChinese American MSPPDD is cheap, and frankly even PF Chang's is not expensive like MY China or Koi Palace in comparison. The bottom line is, does it taste good, and what kind of clientele does it attract? WTF, did I just abbreviate moo shoo poo poo doo doo MSPPDD like Xiao long bao (XLB)??\n\nWith Le Soleil, while the style and approach can be argued to be similar to that of Thanh Long, there is a bit of a Chinese influence in a good number of the dishes. And that is because of the executive chef Dennis Wong, who is Vietnamese Chinese and who also understands the target demographic.\n\nThis restaurant continues to be very popular for a number of reasons. The food might not be authentic Vietnamese or regional specific by any means, but attracts a stready stream of clientele, mostly locals who live in the area (of which a majority are Cantonese speaking Chinese folks). \n\nWith that said this meal was overall enjoyable.\n\nCaf\u00e9 sua da - eeeek no bueno. Crustacean and Thanh Long had a much better iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk in relation. This one had this whacked up Vanilla latte caramelly like flavor, like a really bad pre-made Lee's Sandwiches (McBanh Mi or Banh Bucks) iced milk coffee.\n\nYoung coconut - this was dessert. For those too lazy or don't have the hardware at home to cut it open. Drink the juice then use your ice cream scooping skills to carve out the coconut meat (delish).\n\nPan fried combination noodle - To be fair even a horrible chain (from the South and East Bay) New Tung Kee had something like this, but obviously this is way better. Vietnamese Chinese approach to HK style pan fried noodles (jeen meen), except the noodles were arranged like a \"cake\" format, with thicker layers that elevated the toppings (the stir fried combo of broccoli, chicken, shrimp etc). The sauce was a tad too sweet for my liking but otherwise seasoned well. Guessing the sugar is a bit of a crucial component to draw in the masses and is a bit of an unfortunate theme of a number of stir fry dishes here. So instead of asking to \"hold the MSG, less salt, less oil\" with here it's probably best to ask for \"less sugar\" in the dishes (unless sauces are pre-seasoned).\n\nFlambe quail - this is actually one of their signature specials. The quail arrives at the table with some sort of flammable alcohol on top, and the watistaff sets it on fire for a pyro show....but don't worry the bird is already marinated and dead so it's not like Rage Against the Machine's first album cover, but is absolutely rockin'. When the fire dies down the bird is at the right temperature to be consumed. The flamb\u00e9 seals in the juices. Now in terms of flavoring the quail has this remarkable cross between a sexcellent soy sauce chicken coupled with the complexity of Cantonese cha siu (bbq) marinade...maybe a tad Lee Kum Kee esque in flavoring. It was like deja vu eating this. $hit, no wonder there were quite a number of Chinese customers in here. Although a tad sweet (my only gripe), this was very tasty.   \n\nStir fried Portobello mushrooms with Brussels sprouts and string beans - excellent stir fry with a good wok sear. Yet the theme of sugar is a touch strong here, although it provided the needed carmelization. If they could execute this similar to the sambal string beans at Shiok Singaporean Kitchen (more savory and umami), this would work even better.\n\nRoasted crab with garlic noodles - ended up getting half crab, since there was already a lot of food. But those of you who love to whip out the cameras to let them eat first (before others) will know that excess is best...so therefore a whole crab over noodles will look a lot better than a few severed limbs (crab limbs that is). The noodles were like curly ramen....almost but not quite to the thinness of instant noodle ramen packets, yet were still quite tasty. Crab was not in season of course so not as fatty or juicy, but enjoyable.\n\nIt is said that the son (Walter Kwok) of one of the founders of Hong Kong commercial real estate conglomerate (Sun Hung Kei properties) dined here, and loved the food so much he was instrumental in helping Dennis open up Le Soleil at Royal Garden Tsim Sa Tsui in HK.

Le Soleil is a Vietnamese-French fusion restaurant that manages to be classy but not snobby.

More people started coming in after 6:30 but it never felt crowded or noisy. Our waiters were very attentive in refilling our glasses (lemon- and apple-infused water) and changing our plates. But the food was the best part:\n\nBeef Carpaccio -- Appetizer of thinly sliced rare filet mignon. It was my first time having raw beef and the meat melted in my mouth like fresh sashimi. Yum. The side notes of mint, onion, and roasted garlic were satisfying as well.\n\nGreen Papaya Salad -- This might have tasted better if it wasn't served right after the Beef Carpaccio, since it had the same mint-onion taste. The green papaya is in shreds and reminded me of turnip salad. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd order it again when I return (because I will return).\n\nQuail -- Mmmm. The quail is already cooked when it arrives, but the waiter torches it at the table for good measure and good show. The four of us shared one quail, which was sweet and tender to perfection.\n\nCaramelized Sea Bass -- Perhaps my perfect dish of the night. The texture and taste couldn't have been more satisfying and the brussel sprouts underneath were some of the yummiest I've had.\n\nDungeness Crab and Garlic Noodles -- I'm not a big fan of garlic noodles but these were delectable. I especially loved the crab, which was drizzled over with the contents of the crab shell (I'm Chinese and my family loves eating that). \n\nTurmeric Crepe -- I'm not a big fan of the fried taste so this wasn't my favorite dish, but it was also carefully prepared with carrots and greens on the side.\n\nTofu Eggplant -- Yummy, good with rice (rice texture was great too), and pretty reminiscent of Chinese food in flavor. \n\nMy overall impression of Le Soleil was that each and every detail is carefully attended to. Not only was the food delicately prepared, but the bathroom was very clean and elegantly decorated, and the bill came in a bamboo cup instead of the usual tray or leather book.

It was sweeter than expected and had a very refreshing flavor to it.  The coconut meat was also super soft and sweet!  Almost like eating a healthy and natural almond jello.  I'd eat this every day if I could.  \n\nEverything was pretty solid and amazing on this visit.  The food was on point.  The chef even came out and asked us if everything was good and up to our standards (probably cause we special ordered the lobster).  Overall, amazing experience.

", "They also have brown rice. "], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Vietnamese food use to be a weekly staple for me. You could find me at Loi's, PPQ Noodle House, or Pho Huynh Hiep (Kevin's Noodle House) getting a nice facial over a hot steaming bowl of pho, face shoveling into a combo rice plate or getting buzzed off Vietnamese iced coffee. \n\nWith age, came my intolerance to MSG and caffeine along with a couple of crow's feet, aching knees, and bladder leakage that will soon be in need of Depends. Not to mention passing out in front of the TV even before the guest list opens up at most clubs. Ohhh if only I can be 21 again. \n\nAnyhow, back to food talk because who doesn't love taking about food? :)\n\nThese days, I rarely if ever eat Vietnamese food because of the MSG. Yes, I know it's a staple in Asian cuisine but my body can no longer tolerate it so it makes it difficult to enjoy most Asian cuisine and the wallet-friendly prices. \n\nA rarity, Le Soleil serves upscale MSG-FREE Vietnamese cuisine with French influences. If you're looking for pho, please go somewhere else. It's ridiculous to complain that Le Soleil only has one pho option; they're not Pho 99. However, if you're looking to tantalize your taste buds with unique Vietnamese cuisine made with top-notch ingredients then Le Soleil is the place for you. \n\nThe menu is fairly limited at just 22 items for dinner but with you can make special requests ahead of time with Chef Dennis (24-48 hour in advance so he can buy the ingredients) who's a super nice guy. His specialties on the menu includes Flamb\u00e9ed Quail, Caramelized Sea Bass, and Roasted Garlic Dungeness Crab. They also have brown rice. Yay!\n\nWe started with the Beef Carpaccio ($8). Sorry, no pic for this app since my phone decided to not share this deliciousness with you and deleted the pic *shakes fist*. The tender slices of filet mignon was lightly dressed in a citrus, mint, and chili concoction and served alongside a basket of freshly fried thick shrimp chips (not that stale, flimsy cheap shit at Chinese restaurants). A real solid starter. \n\nThe Bo Luc Lac: Shaking Beef ($16) came next; spelled \"shaken\" on the menu. We added an egg on request (+$2) and it came on a sizzling platter which reminded me of Filipino sisig: http://bit.ly/186ePRX. Just when I thought I tasted the best bo luc lac at Bodega Bistro in TL, a bite of the mouth-wateringly buttery bo luc lac made me realized the BEST has been hidden here at Le Soleil. Not a dish I wanted to share, I'll tell you that much. \n\nAll heads turned when the gargantuan Garlic Roasted Crab w/ Egg Noodles ($32) was placed on our table for two: http://bit.ly/18TBgMz. Insanely fresh, the crab was delicately tender and ohh sooo sweet. The bits of garlic infused just enough garlickyness without leaving us with major dragon breath. The innards of the crab was then mixed with the egg noodles for an artery-clogging carb fest. My only gripe was the noodles; it was more mushy and I like my noodles al-dente with a toothsome chew. Perhaps a thicker noodle would have fared better? \n\nI know people want to know if Le Soleil's crab is as good as PPQ or Thanh Long and there's really no comparison as both PPQ and Thanh Long uses tons of MSG to flavor their signature crab dishes. As I've said, that's like comparing real tits to fake ones. Don't get me wrong, I like fake ones too and I would get a pair to fix my lopsided ones but there's really no comparison.\n\nBecause it's not a complete dinner without dessert (especially when dining out), we wanted to order the Tempura Ice Cream but one of the waitresses brought us the Trio of Ice Cream. When we told her we had ordered the Tempura Ice Cream she said they didn't have it. We instead requested the Fried Bananas with Ice Cream ($4.50) which was tempura battered bananas served with coconut ice cream (sorry, no pic). Huh? They had the tempura batter for the bananas but not for the ice cream? This made no sense. \n\nAside from this minor blunder, service was very friendly and attentive. A smile goes a long way which most Asian restaurants don't seem to get. But Le Soleil does. All smiles here--thank you!\n\nAlong with the atypical Vietnamese fare and good service, Le Soleil has a very contemporary and more upscale ambiance which makes it great for dates. Beware of the terrible parking situation in this area though. \n\nEverything about Le Soleil seems to warrant almost 5 stars. So why just 4? I asked if Chef Dennis can replicate Brodard's FAMOUS Nem Nuong Cuon in SoCal: http://bit.ly/1g5JNyD and he says he can with advanced notice. Going to hold out on that one extra star until I can meet my beloved crack rolls without travelling 400+ miles. If he can deliver, I will gladly upgrade to 5 stars with a big smooch on the face!

Le Soleil is a Vietnamese-French fusion restaurant that manages to be classy but not snobby. It's located in a quiet neighborhood in Richmond and the interior atmosphere is quite relaxing and modern as well. \n\nWe arrived around 5:30 or 5:45 and the restaurant was almost empty. More people started coming in after 6:30 but it never felt crowded or noisy. Our waiters were very attentive in refilling our glasses (lemon- and apple-infused water) and changing our plates. But the food was the best part:\n\nBeef Carpaccio -- Appetizer of thinly sliced rare filet mignon. It was my first time having raw beef and the meat melted in my mouth like fresh sashimi. Yum. The side notes of mint, onion, and roasted garlic were satisfying as well.\n\nGreen Papaya Salad -- This might have tasted better if it wasn't served right after the Beef Carpaccio, since it had the same mint-onion taste. The green papaya is in shreds and reminded me of turnip salad. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd order it again when I return (because I will return).\n\nQuail -- Mmmm. The quail is already cooked when it arrives, but the waiter torches it at the table for good measure and good show. The four of us shared one quail, which was sweet and tender to perfection.\n\nCaramelized Sea Bass -- Perhaps my perfect dish of the night. The texture and taste couldn't have been more satisfying and the brussel sprouts underneath were some of the yummiest I've had.\n\nDungeness Crab and Garlic Noodles -- I'm not a big fan of garlic noodles but these were delectable. I especially loved the crab, which was drizzled over with the contents of the crab shell (I'm Chinese and my family loves eating that). \n\nTurmeric Crepe -- I'm not a big fan of the fried taste so this wasn't my favorite dish, but it was also carefully prepared with carrots and greens on the side.\n\nTofu Eggplant -- Yummy, good with rice (rice texture was great too), and pretty reminiscent of Chinese food in flavor. \n\nMy overall impression of Le Soleil was that each and every detail is carefully attended to. Not only was the food delicately prepared, but the bathroom was very clean and elegantly decorated, and the bill came in a bamboo cup instead of the usual tray or leather book. The meal was a little pricey, at $24 per person, but maybe that's just because we kept ordering more to try the menu. We got what we paid for, though.

", "Yet the theme of sugar is a touch strong here, although it provided the needed carmelization. "], "author": "Ken K.", "review": "Those of you who have lived in the SF Bay Area and through the 1980s/90s will no doubt remember the famous Thanh Long restaurant (which spun its high end counterpart Crustacean) along with a few copycats or competitors offering somewhat similar fare. I cannot speak for Vietnamese expats and how they view this sort of fare, but they have taken some traditional and not so traditional receipes, and figured out a way to make the best use of local/American ingredients and made it into their signature dish (garlic butter roasted Dungeness crab). It's easy to say on one hand that it's Vietnamese style moo shoo poo poo doo doo...but it's not cheap for one thing!\n\nChinese American MSPPDD is cheap, and frankly even PF Chang's is not expensive like MY China or Koi Palace in comparison. The bottom line is, does it taste good, and what kind of clientele does it attract? WTF, did I just abbreviate moo shoo poo poo doo doo MSPPDD like Xiao long bao (XLB)??\n\nWith Le Soleil, while the style and approach can be argued to be similar to that of Thanh Long, there is a bit of a Chinese influence in a good number of the dishes. And that is because of the executive chef Dennis Wong, who is Vietnamese Chinese and who also understands the target demographic.\n\nThis restaurant continues to be very popular for a number of reasons. The food might not be authentic Vietnamese or regional specific by any means, but attracts a stready stream of clientele, mostly locals who live in the area (of which a majority are Cantonese speaking Chinese folks). \n\nWith that said this meal was overall enjoyable.\n\nCaf\u00e9 sua da - eeeek no bueno. Crustacean and Thanh Long had a much better iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk in relation. This one had this whacked up Vanilla latte caramelly like flavor, like a really bad pre-made Lee's Sandwiches (McBanh Mi or Banh Bucks) iced milk coffee.\n\nYoung coconut - this was dessert. For those too lazy or don't have the hardware at home to cut it open. Drink the juice then use your ice cream scooping skills to carve out the coconut meat (delish).\n\nPan fried combination noodle - To be fair even a horrible chain (from the South and East Bay) New Tung Kee had something like this, but obviously this is way better. Vietnamese Chinese approach to HK style pan fried noodles (jeen meen), except the noodles were arranged like a \"cake\" format, with thicker layers that elevated the toppings (the stir fried combo of broccoli, chicken, shrimp etc). The sauce was a tad too sweet for my liking but otherwise seasoned well. Guessing the sugar is a bit of a crucial component to draw in the masses and is a bit of an unfortunate theme of a number of stir fry dishes here. So instead of asking to \"hold the MSG, less salt, less oil\" with here it's probably best to ask for \"less sugar\" in the dishes (unless sauces are pre-seasoned).\n\nFlambe quail - this is actually one of their signature specials. The quail arrives at the table with some sort of flammable alcohol on top, and the watistaff sets it on fire for a pyro show....but don't worry the bird is already marinated and dead so it's not like Rage Against the Machine's first album cover, but is absolutely rockin'. When the fire dies down the bird is at the right temperature to be consumed. The flamb\u00e9 seals in the juices. Now in terms of flavoring the quail has this remarkable cross between a sexcellent soy sauce chicken coupled with the complexity of Cantonese cha siu (bbq) marinade...maybe a tad Lee Kum Kee esque in flavoring. It was like deja vu eating this. $hit, no wonder there were quite a number of Chinese customers in here. Although a tad sweet (my only gripe), this was very tasty.   \n\nStir fried Portobello mushrooms with Brussels sprouts and string beans - excellent stir fry with a good wok sear. Yet the theme of sugar is a touch strong here, although it provided the needed carmelization. If they could execute this similar to the sambal string beans at Shiok Singaporean Kitchen (more savory and umami), this would work even better.\n\nRoasted crab with garlic noodles - ended up getting half crab, since there was already a lot of food. But those of you who love to whip out the cameras to let them eat first (before others) will know that excess is best...so therefore a whole crab over noodles will look a lot better than a few severed limbs (crab limbs that is). The noodles were like curly ramen....almost but not quite to the thinness of instant noodle ramen packets, yet were still quite tasty. Crab was not in season of course so not as fatty or juicy, but enjoyable.\n\nIt is said that the son (Walter Kwok) of one of the founders of Hong Kong commercial real estate conglomerate (Sun Hung Kei properties) dined here, and loved the food so much he was instrumental in helping Dennis open up Le Soleil at Royal Garden Tsim Sa Tsui in HK.

More people started coming in after 6:30 but it never felt crowded or noisy. Our waiters were very attentive in refilling our glasses (lemon- and apple-infused water) and changing our plates. But the food was the best part:\n\nBeef Carpaccio -- Appetizer of thinly sliced rare filet mignon. It was my first time having raw beef and the meat melted in my mouth like fresh sashimi. Yum. The side notes of mint, onion, and roasted garlic were satisfying as well.\n\nGreen Papaya Salad -- This might have tasted better if it wasn't served right after the Beef Carpaccio, since it had the same mint-onion taste. The green papaya is in shreds and reminded me of turnip salad. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd order it again when I return (because I will return).\n\nQuail -- Mmmm. The quail is already cooked when it arrives, but the waiter torches it at the table for good measure and good show.

Le Soleil is just a five minute walk from our house, and while it's getting harder and harder to get a table in this city without a reservation, we're usually able to walk right in. I have probably been here ten times, and I find it to be a great experience every time. The reason I'm conflicted about writing this review is that I want to praise this place... but I don't want the secret to get out! I like my minimal wait times for delicious food!\n\nI have never had a dish here that isn't good. The wait staff is super friendly, and everything has such a unique flavor that I haven't really seen replicated at other similar restaurants in the bay area. There are lots of good cheap Asian places in the city, and this place isn't cheap... but it's also not super expensive. Dishes are in the $12 to $18 range. They have so many good dishes - I recommend coming here with a group of four and doing family style. With four people, you'll likely get a table pretty quickly, and you'll be able to share a lot of things.\n\nIf it's your first visit to the restaurant and you have four people, I would recommend starting with the imperial rolls and shrimp papaya salad. The rolls are fried, but you wrap them in lettuce and dip them in some sauce. The salad is super refreshing. For your main course, make sure to get the shaken beef or grilled pork along with garlic noodles w/ tiger prawns (not on the menu). Then pick something else that sounds good, and that should be a good meal.\n\nThere are some places that are good neighborhood spots, and then there are some that you'll go across town for.

Being my first time, I deferred to them in composing our meal.  The dining room was about half full as we were seated at a wall table on the left.  Our party of four fit comfortably here but, after our order was placed, the table seemed small given the food that was to come.\n\nHere's what we shared family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1.  Green papaya shrimp salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3bk1ovEVEhuuM2mhAb6ig&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Refreshing and clean, this was a perfect palate opener.

Imperial rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0mLUIvtX3JTJsH8VICstmg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Always appreciate chefs who stay true to the cuisine, using the proper wrapper (not Chinese spring roll) to make this.  Always a table favorite.\n\n3.  Crispy calamari (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=E1hfdF_pLCiOBeOfVhyXoA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A non conventional take on fried calamari as this is seasoned with Thai chili sauce and other herbs.  Nice flavor contrast to the first two apps.\n\nMains\n4.  Curry short ribs (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8k-5WXGICzItTzseiSE3Tg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Tender and boneless, these were easy to eat and paired well with either the garlic noodles or the claypot rice.  The sauce was rich but note overly so.\n\n5.  Garlic roasted Dungeness crab, whole (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hb0KDx8ghfUY8J5WzizUmw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Served with garlic noodles, this crab was a solid dish.  The flavors weren't particularly distinct but you can't beat eating fresh crab when in season.  Be ready to lick those fingers.\n\n6.  Caramelized sea bass (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fl0s19_lcgnZksbPO0RhDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Not my favorite but another decent dish.  Don't get me wrong, the fish was fine and paired well with the broccoli but it didn't particularly wow me.\n\n7.  Claypot rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cTbzYy1pdlt9zGrHMaTM3A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - There is certainly no shortage of ingredients in this dish as shown in the picture.

It's wonderful to see a chef that loves his craft and gets excited about cooking for us.

The duck was SUPER tender and the pineapple flavor just enough to give this dish a sweetness without overpowering the savory flavors.\n\n* Mango Sticky Rice ($5.50) - 3.5\nOh, this reminds me of those wonderful desserts in China!

Previously, I've really loved Le Soleil's version of this, since they used to serve very fresh ingredients: herbs, lettuce, seasoned, grilled meats and always threw in some pickled onions - yes! \n\nHowever, my last meal there, the beef was chewy and gristly but tasted okay, all the way to the very last bite, which unfortunately, was off -- as in BAD, very BAD, leaving a liver taste in my mouth that I had trouble washing out even hours later. I still get the shivers thinking about whether I was permanently poisoned.

Over the next 90 minutes, Le Soleil filled up with patrons. Clearly this spot is popular among locals. Why wouldn't it be? The food is fantastic. We started off with the imperial rolls (very tasty!) and the chicken & shrimp crepe (also good!). My favorite of the night was the shaken beef. I've ordered this dish at other Vietnamese establishments but I have to say this is the best one I've had. Succulent beef cubes sit over a bed of softened red onions and is served with a lemony sauce. This was a nice accompaniment with the house fried rice (with duck). Finally, the five spice chicken was also satisfying. It was boneless but with the skin on (mhmm!). It was served alongside a fresh slaw of cabbage, onions, carrot, and mint. The only thing that needed some improvement was the lychee iced tea. There was hardly a lychee taste in the beverage. Overall, the flavors were solid and the prices were fair.\n\nOur server was attentive and the others who aided him came by a couple times to check up on us.

It was just fine but not a standout dish by any means. \n\nDrink:\n\\\\ Young Coconut - So freaking good. Served in the coconut, so fresh and only $4. Def helped cure my hangover from the night before.\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I can't.

All the food had great presentation so there were a lot of \"ooh's\" and \"aah's. Also - the water is fantastic! They have a big pitcher in the bar at the back that has orange + lemon slices in it.\n\nMAJOR BONUS POINTS because I forgot my leftovers, came back 20 minutes later after they'd closed, and the chef was so sweet that he made me an entire new dish! And it was a good one - the Luc Lac beef!\n\n* Shrimp Rice Crispies - 4 stars\n(Shrimp cakes & water chestnut filling, sweet rice crust, lightly fried. $7)\nI really enjoyed this - think of it as a tightly packed shrimp cube, with crispy outer breading (like that dim sum dish), and a nice peanut-y sauce to dip. \n\n* Luc Lac \"Shaken Beef\" - 3.5 stars\n(wok tossed flank steak, lemon pepper dipping sauce over rice. $16)\nReally great quality beef, though a tiny bit overcooked for my taste. It has a great flavor by itself, but once I added the lemon dipping sauce (actually now that I'm reading this off the menu.. I should have dipped as per its name rather than poured it over all the beef) it became agonizingly tart.\n\n* Macadamia Lamb Chops - 4 stars\n(cumin & macadamia crusted lamb chops, with brussels sprouts & japanese sweet yam. $15)\nAll the ingredients just sounded so intriguing in combination and I don't regret ordering this! The lamb was great, just a hint of rareness in the middle of the chop. The brussels sprouts were a little soggy (I like 'em crispy) but still went well with the sweet yam (the purple type).\n\n* House Fried Rice - 4 stars\n(duck & pineapple stir fried rice seasoned with scallions and garlic. $11)\nTried a bite - holy cow this was good! The duck was SUPER tender and the pineapple flavor just enough to give this dish a sweetness without overpowering the savory flavors.\n\n* Mango Sticky Rice ($5.50) - 3.5\nOh, this reminds me of those wonderful desserts in China! While all the ingredients were right, the rice wasn't quite sticky enough and was more hard and stale. It's all about that stickiness!\n\n* Tempuraed Coconut Ice Cream ($4.50) - 4.5 stars\n\"WOW\" was the first word out of everyone's lips who tried this.

Garlic roasted Dungeness crab, whole (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hb0KDx8ghfUY8J5WzizUmw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Served with garlic noodles, this crab was a solid dish.

Here are the food that we ordered:\n1. Garlic noodle with Dungeness crab (never seen crab on garlic noodle before)\n2. Vegetarian brown fried rice\n3. Catfish clay pot (this dish was really really sweet so you definitely need to eat with white rice)\n4. Imperial egg roll\n5. Escargot noodle (this one is soup). Thought it was interesting to see escargot in a noodle soup type. Almost the same color as bun rieu\n6. Beef capriccio with shrimp chip: although its raw but it has a sweetness flavor to it\n7. Papaya salad (thought it was alright)\n8. Curry short ribs (the meats were very tender and curry was good and it was good to eat with rice)\nThere were so good that we almost eat everything that we order except for the fried rice only had a few bite. By the time the fried rice came out, we were already full but we took it home. Good thing that we didnt get the crepe. We thought we order the crepe but never came and good thing that they never charge for it anyways.

It's wonderful to see a chef that loves his craft and gets excited about cooking for us. We've special ordered crab with steamed egg as well as lobster with sticky rice on special occasions since they're pricier (but worth it in quality). They also welcome our feedback so if you prefer a dish a certain way next time, let them know. \n\nMy parents have lived in Vietnam so we can special order more traditional dishes, too, which he'll try to make with the available ingredients. At lunch today, I asked if he can make the cha ca hanoi fish and the bun cha hanoi grilled pork that I saw in Hanoi, he said sure. I believe that the grilled pork will be added to the regular lunch menu soon. I loved the fish which was lightly fried and served with a plate of veggies, rice paper, and anchovy dipping sauce - he advised us on how to properly wrap and eat the dish. I'm not usually a fan of the anchovy sauce but his version was so good that I finished the sauce.\n\nJust make sure both are working that day and ask for the price of your special order so that there aren't any surprises.

Along with bitter, tough Brussels sprouts that were *actually* the least awful part of the dish.\n\nService: where do I even start....\n\nThe waiter who asked at the door whether we had a reservation (we did.) said we'd have to wait at least 10 minutes until more tables cleared. (Even though we saw an empty, clean table right there.) After several minutes waiting in the entryway, suddenly the owner noticed us and sat us right away, at that table.\n\nIt was a wait before anyone came to take our order... when the waitress finally came over, they were out of the appetizer we wanted (we saw other tables getting it before us). Instead of giving us a second to pick another she said \"Sorry we're out of that, I'll come back later\" and left.\n\nShe came back with our drinks awhile later. My bf's beer was in a bottle with some poured into the glass -- one inch of liquid in the bottom of the glass, about 5 inches of foam. We both laughed because it honestly looked like a joke. My wine was a white (not what I expected or wanted) so she went back to check if it was the one I'd asked for. She returned, and yes -- apparently I'd ordered the only white on the red side of the wine list. She was nice enough to offer a new glass no questions asked, I thanked her and said we're ready to order, too, she just dashed away with the unwanted wine saying \"okay I'll come back later.\" bluuurrrgggghhhhhhh\n\nWe FINALLY order and get our dishes (see rant above) and were not impressed. The owner walked by and noticed our lamb dish was hardly touched and was bright bloody pink. She was so nice, apologized and offered to cook it more or bring us something new -- however we were pretty put off and said we were full anyway. She took it off the bill. I really appreciate that she cared so much and tried to make it a better experience.\n\nSo we were done eating, and a different waiter came to clear our plates. We had one short rib left, and even though he didn't love the dish, my bf asked for a box to take it home. The waiter says ok, then forgets and immediately throws a dirty bowl right into the dish. He heard my \"Uh?!\" as he ran off, and rushed back to apologize and tried to take the bowl out of the dish and sort of held it out as if we might still want it. OMG NO!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHence the free dessert. The owner was so apologetic and it's not like we were even complaining -- it's just that the experience was so clearly terrible from beginning to end. Because of the owner's obvious concern and kindness, I raised my star rating from 1 stars to 2. Unfortunately I just can't rate the place any higher no matter how good her intentions are.\n\nThis place could use an ENTIRELY new waitstaff, a better wine list that makes sense on the menu, a few fresh dishes that aren't so greasy, more consistent chefs -- just change everything please.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Then, Wendy's boyfriend, Jerry, ordered the Curry Short Ribs and I ordered the Shaken Beef for entrees and we shared.

We came here for a late lunch the other day. We've seen this place and have driven by so many times. I guess we had really high expectations for this place and thought that it would be like upscale Vietnamese cuisine. Why pay more for Vietnamese food if you can get something tastier down the street for a way better price?Not sure, but we thought that we would just try it. The decor in this restaurant is lovely, but that seems to be the only thing that they have going for them. We walked into the restaurant and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Took a bit, but I guess I was expecting too much? We were seated and were handed our menus. It was interesting that the menu was in English only. My bf wanted to order Bun Bo Hue, but we couldn't tell which item it was on the menu(depending on where you go, it's called something different in English), but if it was in Vietnamese we wouldn't have had a problem. I guess it didn't matter since my bf ordered in Vietnamese anyway. I ordered the lemon grass chicken over rice. My rice plate came out first. I was pleasantly surprised.... the chicken was really tasty, not dry at all and the green beans were cooked just right no soggy green beans I thoroughly enjoyed it, but...... the portion was way too small for the price, like I said earlier.
