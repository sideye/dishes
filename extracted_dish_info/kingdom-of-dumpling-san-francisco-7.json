BUT. Even though their meat insides are quite minuscule, they do the best job with a light, fluffy breading, shaped into a cute bun, fried golden brown on the bottom and topped with sesame seeds and chopped green onions on top.

And luckily, we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  Kingdom of Dumpling is a hole-in-the-wall place in all aspects; from the non-obviousness exterior, to literally feeling like you are dining in someone's low-ceiling garage.

And despite the stuffy-ness from the low ceiling of the dining room, it was actually quite cozy and warm given the nippy weather outside. \n\nMind you, if you don't speak Mandarin, you might have a difficult time figuring out what certain items are because of the fact that the descriptions on the menu all are pretty similar.  \n\nFurthermore, the server's speak minimal English.  The owner, if you are lucky to have him on site, is friendly and cheerful and speaks great English.   But overall, you must definitely just go with your gut here when ordering.  \n\nSo one of the items with all of the talk is of course the Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Siew Loong Bao).  6 Dumplings for $4.95  Perfectly steamed, with a nice chewy texture; great amounts of broth inside as you bite into the dumpling.

Also quite yummy and nicely stuffed with pork.  I like when my dumplings are boiled and steamed perfectly without a sticky texture that I so often experience at other spots. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=xS7L42XUAt9fH0EI85k1Vw\n\nAnother hyped-up item here is the Onion Pancake.  *Eh* For me, this item did not live up to the excitement that I was looking forward to.

We ordered this blindly as the server really didn't have a good description for us other than that there is sesame top.  What it actually is close to the Sesame Balls with Red Bean Paste Inside (Jin Dui, when you eat this at dim sum).  But rather, it was filled with a black bean paste and the texture of the donut is more like a flakey puff pastry.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=D4ZSlHwECO_8lo7olrkVVg\n\nMy advice on this spot...come here if you aren't super starving as you definitely need to order a lot of dumplings to actually get full.  Our bill came out to about 30 bucks, which for dumplings is a bit steep in my eyes.  Definitely more of a snack spot.

They come 6 to an order, and were ready to go as soon as we sat down (they take your order while you're waiting, which I think is a pretty cool way to compensate for the lack of space within the restaurant).

Served cold and was a great complement with the other hot dishes. I would order these again in a second.\n- Lamb dumpling w/ Chinese Vegetable: The lamb/veggie filling inside was delicious, and the dumpling skin was far more delicate than the xlb. Another must order dish.\n\nCould take or leave:\n- Black bean string beans; The flavor was pretty good, but they were really under-seasoned, The black bean sauce was fairly watery so it didn't really stick to the beans very well. Okay, would probably order again for a veggie dish.\n- Salt & Pepper Tofu: Again, it tasted good. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which is what you want. However, when this dish came out the soft insides of the tofu were hotter than the surface of the sun.

I think we were pretty lucky, because a few other groups came after us, and they had to wait for table. \n\nAs for the shanghai dumplings, each had a huge mouthful of soup in each one. The soup to meat ratio felt like 2:1. There actually wasn't all that much meat in each dumpling; it was mostly soup! The dumpling skin wasn't especially thin, but I guess that made easier to pick up. The dumplings were served PIPING HOT, so I'd recommend letting them cool for a good few minutes before popping the whole thing in your mouth. \n\nOther good dishes were:\n:: Farmer's cucumber - classic pickled cucumber served in China. Bonus, they use ORGANIC cucumber. \n:: Cold wide bean noodle - another good starter dish with cucumber and bean noodle. It has a similar flavor to the farmer's cucumber though, so I'd probably order one or the other.\n:: Pork and corn dumplings - the corn gives a nice hint of sweetness to the dumplings.

They're nice and crunchy though, and vegetarians won't complain about having a dumpling option. :)\n\nOther:\nGarlic string bean: the texture is firm and it's a staple every time I come.

As we came later in the day, we were seated within several minutes.\n\nFOOD:\n*XLB (3 orders): YUMMY! The XLB was perfectly bundled in its wrapper and steamed. The wrapper was a little thicker in texture than the ones from Shanghai Dumpling King, so it was a lot more sturdy and didn't fall apart and/or rip when you picked it up. The savory soup was bursting with flavor and the pork filling was moist, tender, and very flavorful. The accompanying soy vinegar ginger sauce was a perfect complement as it gave a salty, sweet, and tangy punch to the XLB.\n\n*Pan-fried XLB: Good! This XLB's wrapper was thicker and resembled and tasted more like a mini pan-fried pork bun. The wrapper was nice and crisp on the bottom and soft in the center. The pork filling was similar to the steamed XLB and was still moist and very flavorful despite not having the soup in it.\n\n*Beef Pancake: OMG--SOO GOOD! Who doesn't like a beef cake?!?! Lol! It was essentially a triple layer of a thin, crisp pancake filled with two thin flavorful beef patties. Their homemade creamy garlic chili sauce was a perfect complement to the pancake.\n\n*Green Chive Pancake: It was good! This was basically a chinese version of a pita wrap. The pancake was crisp and a nice doughy texture to it and was generously stuffed with a green onions and QQ noodles (clear vermicelli noodles). All the flavors were really subtle, so you must dip it on the garlic chili sauce.\n\n*Pork w/ Napa Cabbage Dumplings: GOOD! The dumplings wrapper was slightly thicker than a wonton wrapper and was al-dente. The pork filling was very moist, juicy, and flavorful. It went very well with the soy vinegar ginger sauce.\n\n*Shrimp and Chive Dumplings: It was just ok. The same wrapper was used as the pork dumpling. There was more chive than anything, so I didn't really taste the shrimp.\n\n*Shrimp and Pork Wonton Soup w/ Wide Noodles: Perfect hangover food! The wontons were perfectly cooked leaving an al-dente skin; the filling which was mainly pork was moist and flavorful. The broth was DELISH and was definitely very pure; none of that MSG killer. The wide noodles (chow fun) noodles were cooked al-dente which gave it a nice bite. \n\n*XO Beef Chowfun: YUM! Although I didn't taste any components of XO sauce (dried scallop, fish, shrimp, chili paste, garlic, and etc), it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The noodles were al-dente and wasn't too oily. The beef was tender and flavorful, although there very few pieces of it. The bean sprouts and green onions gave it a nice crunch and freshness to the dish.\n\nPRICES:\n*Apps (i.e. pancakes): $3.95-$4.95\n*Dumplings (4-12 pieces): $4.95 to $6.95\n*Noodle soups/Noodle Dishes: $5.95-$6.95\n\nWe ordered 10 dishes among 4 people (yes, our eyes were and always BIGGER than our stomachs) and it came to $20/person including tip and we had leftovers to feed another 3 people.\n\nSERVICE:\nPretty good for a hole-in-the-wall.

Initially, they sat us at the back table near the kitchen which reeked of vinegar and he gladly let us move to another table when another party had left.\n\nThe first dish came out in 5-7 minutes and each dish after than came out in 4-5 min increments.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nKOD is epitome of a hole-in-the wall. It's tiny and can accommodate about 20-24 people. The sticky tables are very close to each other, so don't be surprised if the table next to you bumps you with their chair. The place does reek of pungent vinegar, but you get use to the smell within 10 minutes or so.\n\nPARKING:\nSince it's located in Outer Sunset/Parkside, street parking is a little easier to come by than the Inner Sunset.

The people who get the coins in their dumplings during the big family dinner is supposed to have a prosperous new year :)\n\nKingdom of Dumpling (KOD for short) is quite good, on par with Prosperity Dumpling in NYC if you've ever been there. They have a lot of variations so you'll probably find something you like.\n\nI love the cabbage and pork dumpling here - it's well balanced and perfectly seasoned. Napa cabbages usually emit a lot of water when cooked so even my mom's cabbage/pork dumplings tend to be soggier when she makes them, but you don't really find that at KOD. They're just perfect bursts of flavor and joy here :)\n\nIf you want a more nuanced taste, just replace cabbage with chives. Note they're not the western chives that you see on top of smoked salmon sometimes. Chinese chives have a stronger flavor, kind of like a mild green onion - it's great, try it! There, I've described for you the two big Chinese dumpling staples - cabbage and chives.\n\nOf course, depending on your dietary habit you could swap pork out for shrimp or chicken or even beef/lamb. I don't think I've ever tried a beef dumpling at KOD but their lamb dumplings were a surprising let-down (actually kind of bland). Their shrimp one is also good (although still a stretch from the pork IMO), if you want to switch things up a bit.\n\nOne of the things that I didn't discover until my 5th or 6th visit here is their GARLIC STRING BEANS. I'll just leave it at that and leave you to discover for you its greatness. We had to get two orders of that because it was just so good.

It'll come out to about $15, but you'll feel great after washing everything down with a pot of tea :)\n\n* other dumpling assessments:\nXiao Long Bao - they have the funniest shaped XLBs I've ever seen...they're shaped like little turrets. They're not bad, but they're also not ridiculously good. Try it once and decide if you want to keep getting it - it's good to switch things up a bit and have a steamed dumpling though.\n\nPan-fried versions - a hot oily griddle + dumpling is a match made in heaven\n\nor you can also just get another order of boiled dumpling. or two. ;)\n\nps. The wait can be kind of long at lunch/dinner rush hours so try to come at an off time if you can. It'll save a lot of waiting since the restaurant is really small and there's no covered area to wait.

Also a good sign - all of the patrons were Chinese (points to the food being authentic). \n\nWe were seated soon enough. It was chilly outside, yet the kitchen made the dining room feel like the inside of a furnace. Thank goodness I dressed in layers. \n\nThe owner, managed the room with the theatrical flourish of a ringmaster, and alternated between greeting people, seating people, and taking orders.

My husband couldn't get enough of this. Word to the wise: if you like spice, try it dipped it in their secret hot sauce. \n\n3) GRILLED LAMB SKEWERS - This is apparently a popular street food in Beijing. Smoky cumin is the standout flavor and the meat itself is really tender. But I didn't like the occasional mouthful of fat. I would have been happy eating 1 skewer, no more.  \n\n4) GARLIC STRING BEANS - These were yummy, but nothing special.\n\n5) PORK, SHRIMP, AND CHIVE DUMPLINGS - For a place called Kingdom of Dumpling, I had high expectations. However, ours were overcooked. Several of the skins had broken apart and were mushy to the bite. The saving grace was that the few intact ones had a good amount of juice, like in the xiao long bao. \n\n6) PORK & CHINESE SPINACH WONTON SOUP WITH WIDE RICE NOODLES - Uber bland. We ordered this because many other patrons had ordered it. Big mistake. The broth was straight up chicken broth. The wonton skins were mushy and as flavorless as the broth.\n\nAll in all, the dishes were a little hit or miss and I didn't care for the up-selling, especially when we already had too much food.

There were many breakages, and the dumplings were not filled with as much soup as I expected. The meat was also not very flavorful and had an over-processed, slightly chalky texture.\n\nThe shen jian bao were pretty good, but they are erroneously called \"Shanghai pan-fried soup dumplings\" on the menu-- these are not pan-fried XLB; there is no soup in these dumplings! They are more accurately small meat-filled buns that are pan-fried and steamed concurrently.  The \"skin\" is actually leavened dough instead of unleavened dumpling skin. These took about 20 min to come out because they are made fresh to order.\n\nGarlic string beans were crisp, garlicky, and quite oily. I like my string beans a little softer, but for fans of crisp string beans, these would probably be quite delectable.\n\nI had high hopes for Kingdom of Dumpling based on its hype, and I felt let down.

Placed our name, number of people on a paper list, hanging by the doorway.  Wasn't too long, we got a table.\n\nUnder dim sum, item 2 the Shanghai pan fry soup dumplings (4) USD 4.95 wasn't available - a disappointment, so we settled on item 1 the Shanghai soup dumplings (6) USD 4.95, which was really good, but it was the pan fried, which I have had in Shanghai at Yang's Fried Dumpling which I considered to be the gold standard to measure other dumplings which none have come across to be as good.  Item 5 onion pancakes (1) USD 3.95, cut into eight pieces stacked, was hot, oily, crispy, quite tasty, I liked it.\n\nUnder latest new dishes, item 3 the grilled skewered lamb (4) USD 6.95, a slow low mild spiciness that builds, was very tasty; item 18 garlic black fungus with cucumbers with vinegar and garlic USD 5.95, was a cold, slightly crunchy, quite tasty and different.  Q style jelly fish is one of their latest items not on their printed menu, but is posted on the wall.  Also under this catagory are:  green chives dumpling with egg, farmer's cucumber, boiled peanut with celery.\n\nUnder Wok dishes, item 4 garlic string beans USD 6.95 was excellent, cooked, but still crispy, flavored with soy sauce, oil, garlic.  Under drinks, item 2 Thai tea USD 1.75 was iced, sweentened with milk, tasty, not too sweet as I have tasted at other places.\n\nWe ordered one dish too many or didn't really need.  This was before adding the onion pancakes afterward, asked if this was enough food, our waitress said not, so we added under soup noodle, item 1 pork & shrimp wonton with wide rice noodle USD 5.95, which came after every other dish ordered was okay, I thought the wonton skin was rather thick, the soup base passable, but Yin Du Wonton Noodle on Pacific Ave at Beckett St would be superior with thin wonton skin, amazing soup base.\n\nRecommend calling to see if they have Shanghai pan fried soup dumplings before making the trek to the restaurant.

My family loves the dumplings with chives so much, they now go to the Kingdom of Dumpling wholesale to buy frozen ones to resteam and eat at home!", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-08-16"}, {"excerpts": ["xlb are the best i've had in the city, their hot sauce is delicious slathered on the onion (NOT CHIVE) pancake, as are the garlic pea shoots and green beans.
