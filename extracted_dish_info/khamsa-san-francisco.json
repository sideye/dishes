An hour in, I started daydreaming (don't front, you know you do it too!). \n\nJust when we were getting to the juicy NSFW stuff, I was startled by the loud crinkling of bags next to me. I looked to my left and the lady next to me was going to town on her monstrous super burrito. I sat there simultaneously side-eyeing and salivating each bite of stretchy cheese action as crema and salsa roja cascaded down the sides of the tortilla. \n\nWhy you gotta be so cruel?! \n\nBut, I suppose this wasn't as bad as when our former director thought it would be OK to bring in a whole rack of ribs for her lunch during a meeting. While talking, she would suck on the bones like....NVM. Keeping it classy! \n\nAs soon as the meeting was over, I was hangry and on the hunt for a lunch spot. Khamsa, a new Moroccon Fusion restaurant popped up as one of my nearest bookmarks so I made my way there. \n\nKhamsa is located at the ground level of a luxury condo in a part of The Mission that doesn't get much foot traffic. Most businesses in the area are auto body shops so it was a nice change of scenery to walk into such a cute restaurant. While small, the owner(s) did a great job with making the space warm and inviting. There's also an outdoor patio for those rare warm days. \n\nWhen I walked in, there was no one in the dining room so I stood awkwardly near the bar area. After several minutes, I was able to get the attention of someone in the kitchen who sat me down. He said, he would bring me a menu but never did. Five minutes later, the host/server appears and brings me a menu to peruse. \n\nThe Morrocon Fusion menu offers apps (e.g. basteeya), salads, and entrees (e.g. tagine). The lunch and dinner menu appear to have the same items but the prices are lower for lunch. Beer and wine only. \n\nI ordered the Beef Tagine with a side of rice. I was told the Beef Tagine comes with a side of salad or couscous so I went with the former which I don't recommend. More on that later. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, my Beef Tagine w/ side salad ($17) arrives: http://bit.ly/2isCpug. There seems to have been a miscommunication and I didn't initially receive a side of rice ($5) as ordered. But, the server later brought it comped which I really appreciated: http://bit.ly/2w7VXra.\n\nSadly, the Beef Tagine was disappointing. While the English cut short ribs were meaty and tender, they were severely underseasoned/underspiced and there were too many sweet components making the dish cloyingly sweet: http://bit.ly/2w7IAXZ. It desperately needed an acid to cut the sweetness from the caramelized orange (tasted like candy), and the dates and honey balsamic dressing from the salad. I would skip the salad and order the couscous to help balance the sweetness from the short ribs.\n\nService was cordial but spotty even when it was empty. Water glass wasn't refilled until I was getting ready to leave and I had to go to the bar and ask the server for a box and the bill. Maybe it's because I went during lunch but the staff seemed to be distracted with delivery (?) people coming in and out. I'm sure dinner service may be better.\n\nKhamsa is only a month young so I would give them several months to work out the kinks in the kitchen.

An hour in, I started daydreaming (don't front, you know you do it too!). \n\nJust when we were getting to the juicy NSFW stuff, I was startled by the loud crinkling of bags next to me. I looked to my left and the lady next to me was going to town on her monstrous super burrito. I sat there simultaneously side-eyeing and salivating each bite of stretchy cheese action as crema and salsa roja cascaded down the sides of the tortilla. \n\nWhy you gotta be so cruel?! \n\nBut, I suppose this wasn't as bad as when our former director thought it would be OK to bring in a whole rack of ribs for her lunch during a meeting. While talking, she would suck on the bones like....NVM. Keeping it classy! \n\nAs soon as the meeting was over, I was hangry and on the hunt for a lunch spot. Khamsa, a new Moroccon Fusion restaurant popped up as one of my nearest bookmarks so I made my way there. \n\nKhamsa is located at the ground level of a luxury condo in a part of The Mission that doesn't get much foot traffic. Most businesses in the area are auto body shops so it was a nice change of scenery to walk into such a cute restaurant. While small, the owner(s) did a great job with making the space warm and inviting. There's also an outdoor patio for those rare warm days. \n\nWhen I walked in, there was no one in the dining room so I stood awkwardly near the bar area. After several minutes, I was able to get the attention of someone in the kitchen who sat me down. He said, he would bring me a menu but never did. Five minutes later, the host/server appears and brings me a menu to peruse. \n\nThe Morrocon Fusion menu offers apps (e.g. basteeya), salads, and entrees (e.g. tagine). The lunch and dinner menu appear to have the same items but the prices are lower for lunch. Beer and wine only. \n\nI ordered the Beef Tagine with a side of rice. I was told the Beef Tagine comes with a side of salad or couscous so I went with the former which I don't recommend. More on that later. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, my Beef Tagine w/ side salad ($17) arrives: http://bit.ly/2isCpug.

While the English cut short ribs were meaty and tender, they were severely underseasoned/underspiced and there were too many sweet components making the dish cloyingly sweet: http://bit.ly/2w7IAXZ. It desperately needed an acid to cut the sweetness from the caramelized orange (tasted like candy), and the dates and honey balsamic dressing from the salad. I would skip the salad and order the couscous to help balance the sweetness from the short ribs.\n\nService was cordial but spotty even when it was empty. Water glass wasn't refilled until I was getting ready to leave and I had to go to the bar and ask the server for a box and the bill. Maybe it's because I went during lunch but the staff seemed to be distracted with delivery (?) people coming in and out. I'm sure dinner service may be better.\n\nKhamsa is only a month young so I would give them several months to work out the kinks in the kitchen.

An hour in, I started daydreaming (don't front, you know you do it too!). \n\nJust when we were getting to the juicy NSFW stuff, I was startled by the loud crinkling of bags next to me. I looked to my left and the lady next to me was going to town on her monstrous super burrito. I sat there simultaneously side-eyeing and salivating each bite of stretchy cheese action as crema and salsa roja cascaded down the sides of the tortilla. \n\nWhy you gotta be so cruel?! \n\nBut, I suppose this wasn't as bad as when our former director thought it would be OK to bring in a whole rack of ribs for her lunch during a meeting. While talking, she would suck on the bones like....NVM. Keeping it classy! \n\nAs soon as the meeting was over, I was hangry and on the hunt for a lunch spot. Khamsa, a new Moroccon Fusion restaurant popped up as one of my nearest bookmarks so I made my way there. \n\nKhamsa is located at the ground level of a luxury condo in a part of The Mission that doesn't get much foot traffic. Most businesses in the area are auto body shops so it was a nice change of scenery to walk into such a cute restaurant. While small, the owner(s) did a great job with making the space warm and inviting. There's also an outdoor patio for those rare warm days. \n\nWhen I walked in, there was no one in the dining room so I stood awkwardly near the bar area. After several minutes, I was able to get the attention of someone in the kitchen who sat me down. He said, he would bring me a menu but never did. Five minutes later, the host/server appears and brings me a menu to peruse. \n\nThe Morrocon Fusion menu offers apps (e.g. basteeya), salads, and entrees (e.g. tagine). The lunch and dinner menu appear to have the same items but the prices are lower for lunch. Beer and wine only. \n\nI ordered the Beef Tagine with a side of rice. I was told the Beef Tagine comes with a side of salad or couscous so I went with the former which I don't recommend. More on that later. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, my Beef Tagine w/ side salad ($17) arrives: http://bit.ly/2isCpug. There seems to have been a miscommunication and I didn't initially receive a side of rice ($5) as ordered. But, the server later brought it comped which I really appreciated: http://bit.ly/2w7VXra.\n\nSadly, the Beef Tagine was disappointing. While the English cut short ribs were meaty and tender, they were severely underseasoned/underspiced and there were too many sweet components making the dish cloyingly sweet: http://bit.ly/2w7IAXZ. It desperately needed an acid to cut the sweetness from the caramelized orange (tasted like candy), and the dates and honey balsamic dressing from the salad. I would skip the salad and order the couscous to help balance the sweetness from the short ribs.\n\nService was cordial but spotty even when it was empty. Water glass wasn't refilled until I was getting ready to leave and I had to go to the bar and ask the server for a box and the bill. Maybe it's because I went during lunch but the staff seemed to be distracted with delivery (?) people coming in and out. I'm sure dinner service may be better.\n\nKhamsa is only a month young so I would give them several months to work out the kinks in the kitchen.
