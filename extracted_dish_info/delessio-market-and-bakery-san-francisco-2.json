So anyway... like all the Elite events, there were a number of different vendors there offering a wide array of food, desserts, drinks etc. One of them was our lovely Delessio.  They had samples of the Boston Cream Pie, Tres Leches Cake, and Tiramisu (I think). \n\nThe moment the Tres Leches entered my mouth, I was IN LOVE.  I'm not kidding!! I turned to my friends and said, \"Okay, I will disown you both if you don't buy me this cake for my birthday next year!\"\n\nNow, fast forward 8 months to August (my special birthday month). I'm sure my friends have forgotten about my request oh so many months ago, but I didn't let that stop me.  I went and put in an order for my own birthday cake.
