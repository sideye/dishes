It's not free. The prices for the food more than covers off on that. Let me drill down into the specifics of this crime scene. The place has been around forever, since the 70s. As such there are plenty of seniors who like to frequent this joint. They get so drunk and happy off the \"free\" wine that they love to tell you what a fabulous place this is on their way out. My party of 3 got spooked when one senior citizen popped out at us from a corner booth to tell us what a great decision we made coming to PC. She drawled on about how she's been coming here since the 80s. Spotting drool on her lower lip, I leaned away from her as a younger relative helped her with a coat.\n\nShaken, but undeterred, we sipped our overflowing glasses of wine. Only after a few sips, the waiter came back out to return our status back to overflowing.  Generous would be an understatement. In total, we only had to wait 30 mins for a table and once we were seated, the ambiance was quit cozy. Unfortunately the moment of comfort was kept brief when one of my guests noticed large white flecks in her water. We requested a new one without a problem, but we stopped sipping our wine after that. \n\nWe ordered the oysters cocktail. Gross. Why would you present oysters chopped up in a glass? Why remove them from their shells only to have shell pieces floating in the oyster juice? Not a good sign.\n\nEntrees arrived. Crab Louie for me, Mussels for one, and Prawns for the other. Crab Louie was OK - not sure why they have to have giant, 3 inch diameter slices of cucumber and tomatoes that require me to work so hard. Prawns were OK, nothing special. The mussels, however, were super dry with almost no broth. Throughout our meal, the wait staff was attentive and very polite, I had not problems there. But there was certainly concern in their eyes and we all detected a tone of suspicion from them due to our untouched glasses of wine. \n\nThat's right, we weren't drunk, and so the food had to stand on it's own. Well let me tell you, it couldn't. \n\nI like to try every place twice just to be sure, but for over $30 per person? No thanks, I'm done with PC.

Until he mentioned it and looked it up on his iPhone to show me a picture of the street view, I'd never even seen or heard of this tiny, hidden gem of the Richmond district.\n\nSo, after making a list of restaurants we wanted to try, my coworker and I decided to bring our girlfriends along for a \"show and tell\" of friends and try Pacific Cafe, since all of us live in the Richmond. We'd heard that they doled out free wine while waiting, so we set a time to meet up - 7 pm on a Sunday night.\n\nAt first we were told that it was a 45 minute wait, so we took our wine and stood outside, feeling somewhat like yuppies (well, I guess we all are yuppies in a sense). Thirty minutes passed. We looked at the wait list, and there were still about 7 names ahead of us. More wine. Another thirty minutes passed. 4 names ahead of us. Finally, we were seated after about an hour and a half.\n\nNormally, anywhere else I wouldn't have waited more than 30 minutes. However, Pacific Cafe was such a great place; the ambiance was very warm and cozy, and the people (other customers and the wait staff) were all very friendly (maybe it's the wine?). My girlfriends and I decided to order 4 different dishes with all different sides and appetizers, so we could all try everything out.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\n\n- the rainbow trout with fries, which were basically a quarter wedge of a potato. The fish was absolutely delicious; we didn't squeeze the lemon on top (oops) but there was a lump of butter in the middle, which we spread over the fish.\n\n- the sole, with a mushroom and caper sauce, served with rice pilaf. This was also delicious, although I wasn't a fan of the sauce. I like my fish very plain, so I can taste the actual meat of the fish itself. The rice was excellent though, and I'm convinced I'll never be able to do the Atkins' diet.\n\n- the ahi tuna, seared on the outside and served rare on the inside, with a side of wasabi mayo. This was probably my favorite, because the tuna was very, very tender and the wasabi mayo went so perfectly with it.\n\n- the red snapper, which was seasoned on both sides with a spicy mix of ..well.. spices. This fish had the most flavor on its own because of the way it was seasoned, and the meat was also very tender.\n\nAs for the appetizers, we had the Shrimp Louie salad, the Caesar salad, the clam chowder and their crab bisque, which was the special for the night. As an anti-fan of creamy soups, I ditched the bisque in favor of the clam chowder, which had no cream in it.

Short wine list, but budgetarily sound (5$ corkage and a similar markup from winestore prices).  Dessert, I'd recommend going someplace else.\nThe servers know what they're doing, but service can be uneven and god forbid you comment negatively, even in a reasonable way.", "rating": 4, "date": "2006-06-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We start with the moderately spiced and comforting salmon or crab bisque, and the salad with shrimp louie dressing!  "], "author": "Paris E.", "review": "Get the crab diablo (only available during dungeness season), local whole dungeness sauteed in a peppery blend of white wine, shallots, and butter. We alternate between enjoying buttery dungeness flavor of the crab straight out of the shell with dipping some of it into the sauce. The hearty bread is also good for sopping up the tasty sauce and we usually can't get enough of it. We start with the moderately spiced and comforting salmon or crab bisque, and the salad with shrimp louie dressing!  In order to afford pricey dungeness for both of us we often split everthing and order an extra salad and perhaps a veggie.  \n\nThe rest of the daily menu items are predominately straightforward preparations of fresh seafood, either grilled, baked, or pan-fried. The printed menu seafood is more old-skool continental stuff, still good though. \n\nPacific Cafe is basically unchanged since we started going there in the mid 80's, and so is the menu.  No fussy, self-conscious presentations and no Cal, Pan, Neo, or Fusion anything. What a relief. We have been going there for so long that the spicy snapper which used to be 9.98 back is now more like 15.98 due to inflation. We also like the halibut parmesean. \n\nNotice: the clam chowder is not the creamy Boston style you might expect. It's \"pacific\" clam chowder, which is broth based. We have learned to enjoy it when we are in the mood for it. Still looking for the best creamy clam chowder, though. You'd think we'd have it here in SF but it's hard to find. Their bisques make up for it!\n\nEnjoy the free cheap wine while you wait and wait and wait for a table, and even if you come for the first seating as we do, they still give you a glass of the comp wine when you are seated. Refills are only while you are waiting. Once at the table you are expected to order from the wine menu. If you still want to drink more. \n\nAn interesting observation is that even when the restaurant is full, the environment is not overstimulating. We've gone here after an exhausting day and enjoyed having a relaxing meal. It's always relaxing to eat here even though it doesn't look like \"it's been designed and conceived to be relaxing\". Like I said, not self-conscious or considered. Just a regular nice place, with giant huge steak fries.\n\nAvoid the Pacific Cafe over in Marin.

There was a time (the '70's) when using a chalk board to list your fresh specials was quirky and innovative.    \n Oh yes, it was sometime after high school, in '78, when my parents investment in a 16 unit building on Haight Street (\"gee Bernie, do you think the neighborhood will ever be worth anything?\" my mother asked) started to pan out.  They were going out to dinner every week!!!  Sometimes they invited their poor daughter, the waitress, along.  I can still see mom in her black velvet blazer and white \"bow-tie\" blouse (Mayor Feinstein was a fashion icon for middle aged women) and dad in his Harris tweed, shirt open at the neck, NEVER a tie, sitting in a wood booth at Pacific Cafe.  They were on the cusp of making it; retirement was visible on their horizon.  No early bird specials for Bernie and Harriet, just plenty of fresh fish at Pacific Caf.  In 2001 dad went to the big multi unit in the sky.  This is where tenants never flush Kotex, dimes never stall garbage disposals and god did what the Supreme Court wouldn't do -- outlawed rent control.  Mom (still here, going on 90) lived long enough to see warnings about both eating fish (toxins), and the probable extinction of many species, become reality.       \n Would the current reality of Pacific Caf live up to my memories?

In '78, most salads were iceberg with dressing ladled on top -- a salad tossed in vinaigrette (as I remembered their salads to be) was a gourmet treat.

Even then, I would see a small group of people huddling outside on a cold night, which is a frequent occurrence out there.\n\nAfter all these years, I finally came here to chow down and walked away satisfied although I'm not sure if I would rush back here for a meal.

Here are my highlights and thoughts\n\n- Complimentary glass of white wine while you waited\n\n- Crab cakes appetizer were fantastic. I'm usually very weary of ordering them from restaurants since they're typically dry but these were very nicely done. It's not cheap, $10 for 1 or $18 for 2.  I estimate they are probably around 4\" to 4.25\" in diameter\n\n- Friendly service, our server was attentive without seeming to lurk over our meal\n\n- I ordered the Filet of Sole Newburg  with fries which was decent but made a mistake. This dish is stuffed with crab and topped with a cream sauce. I just had the crab cakes so the flavor is all too similar and too heavy. I had choice between this and a Grilled Tuna with wasabi sauce... although I asked the server for recommendation, all she mentioned was they are too completely contrasting dishes. If she would have kept in mind that I ordered the crab cakes, then she could have mentioned the similarities and warned me. The fish wasn't bad but is definitely not memorable. Fries were house cut thick style and were not bad and not soggy or overly salted.\n\n- My girlfriend ordered fried scallops with small red potatoes. The scallops were very fresh and tasted sweet. Since they are just lightly fried, there isn't flavoring from heavy sauces which is fine by me. The potatoes were just served as whole pieces. I wish they would have done something with the potatoes such as lightly grill them or add some herbs/seasoning. Just seemed a bit lazy to serve plain boiled potatoes.\n\n- I do like the place, it's cozy and the booths offer some privacy. It's a nice place for a date night or just hang out with some friends enjoying drinks.\n\nI can honestly say I've had better seafood, but from what I sampled that night, the food is fresh which is important when eating seafood. Most of the dishes seemed to be grilled in some way so tailor expectations on the flavor if there is no sauce that is cooked with the seafood.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-10-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the Filet of Sole Newburg, and this is the first time i've ever had it...", "OMG it was DIVINE!

I expected there to be two small ones at least for $9.50.  All right, it had a lot of crab in it... but there wasn't much crab flavor. It wasn't sweet and the texture was mushy. I'm guessing they used frozen crab for this. In addition, the crab cake came to the table a bit on the cold side. Ick. Seafood, especially fried/pan fried seafood must be served piping hot. There was also nothing special about the flavor. Most times when I have crab cakes in restaurants I go \"mmm YUM!\" None of that here. Disappointing. To be honest, I've made a better crab cake myself...\n\nClam chowder: This tasted different from most typical clam chowders. The consistency was a lot thinner and more potato-ey. I didn't really mind it. But the sad thing is... it sorta reminded me of rice gruel (or rice soup... aka \"jook\" for you Chinese). It was a bit of a turn off... but the taste was acceptable.\n\nSalmon bisque: I read a lot of positive reviews, so I was looking forward to this. I was disappointed. The soup base was too cream heavy. Now, I love cream soups, but I couldn't even taste any salmon flavor. Might as well have called this soup salmon colored cream soup because that's what it was. The only reason why I knew it was the salmon soup was due to the color of the soup and the teeny tiny bits of salmon floating in the soup.\n\nTurbot in parchment: This was all right.

The restaurant was not fancy schmancy. In fact, it was basically no frills and down-to-earth.... like starting dinner off with a boring loaf of sourdough with plain ol' butter. The quaint exterior of the building gave PC a charming and old-fashioned appearance, shrouded occasionally by the enveloping fog. The interior is congested with many tables and antique booths tightly jammed in every nook and cranny. It did exude a cozy and welcoming aura once you step inside not to mention the cool glass of complimentary white wine in your hands for having to wait for a table.\n\nI was amazed as to how simple the menu was. There were only three basic styles of cooking.... Baked or grilled or pan-fried.  Add in a couple of soups and salads and there you have it, the whole menu of PC in a nutshell.\n\nWe wanted to start off by sharing an order of saut\u00e9ed and pan-fried calamari steak.

Sounded like a deal! Calamari is relatively cheap, in abundant supply and ecologically sustainable. PC's calamari was first pounded, egg washed and batter dipped and lightly fried to give the calamari a golden brown crust. In spite of its tough or rubbery reputation, the texture of PC's calamari was so super tender that a fork was all you needed. Coupled with the lip-smacking egg batter, the tender steak earned a well deserved 5 stars. I was told the abalone was prepared much the same way but at $45 a pop, I'd rather stick with calamari and try my luck at diving for abalone off the Mendocino coast!\n\nPetrale sole ($24.95), a Pacific Coast fish, is prized for its delicate, mild and sweet flavors. The fillets were quickly saut\u00e9ed and pan-fried with a sauce of white wine, shallots, butter and herbs. PC then plated the fillets with saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms, a sprinkling of capers and a gentle squeeze of lemon. The sauce wasn't overwhelming so I can still taste the natural flavor of the fish. Even though the prep sounded so simple, I can't somehow make it to taste this good at home! The carb of choice was rice pilaf that tasted exquisite like fried rice and good to soak up the excess sauce.  I guess my doc was right about the sole, though I think I had better elsewhere. (4 stars). Besides, the calamari had the edge! \n\nThe Spicy Red Snapper ($20.68) didn't have the \"wow\" flavor I'd hoped for but my wife said it was still a keeper in the menu.  I personally think that the fish was a tad over grilled and the meat a little drier than I would like. It was labeled as spicy but not in any true sense of the word. The outer crust of the snapper had a robust, tangy char of some kind of mixed Cajun spices and herbs, cayenne pepper perhaps being the most discernable. (3.5 stars). The red snapper's meat was a little firmer and did not have the melt-in-your-mouth quality like the sole.\n\nAll in all, a great seafood place.... the price is right; the food is unpretentious and seafood perfectly executed.

BAY AREA: SEASON 2: EPISODE 6 (206)\n\n4.5 STARS \n\nJuly 11, 2009 @ 7pm, Saturday Date Night with Boyfriend\n\nSaturday nights dates are really important for me and my boyfriend.  It is our time at the end of the week to catch up and just enjoy each other. It's more than going out, it is friendship and keeping that \"flame\" going.  \n\nSo this Saturday was another opportunity. We just wanted a nice, relaxing and laid-back dinner after a really exhausting work week. Pacific Cafe was the perfect place.  It was homey and unpretentious. People were casually and warmly dressed for the cold Richmond district weather . \n\nThis restaurant has been around since 1974 and as San Francisco as you can get--local, friendly and specializing in seafood.  The decor was nostalgic--very 70's. \n\nTrue to its tradition, we were offered a FREE GLASS OF WINE each while waiting for a table.  You just walk in, put your name on the clipboard and find a seat either inside the waiting area huddled with other patrons. We didn't mind since it was nice to be cozy in this cold weather--or sit outside of the restaurant and start a friendly conversation with others who are waiting for their table.\n\nSince BF does not drink, so I got 2 glasses of nice Chardonnay. (Woo Hoo!)  The staff came out to REFILL our glasses but 2 glasses of wine are pretty much all I can handle.\n\nIt didn't take us long to get seated at one of the wooden booths, probably about half an hour. We enjoyed looking at the memorabilias  (like how much food cost in 1974) and sipping wine while waiting.  A basket of sourdough bread was waiting for us at our table. We devoured it and we got another basket as soon as  we finished the first one.  The service was superb and very attentive. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZiTRspDPY9T_kh4tQDwDMQ?select=mQFbFnJXxAcsBUFgSISOrw\nFor appetizers we ordered a CRAB COCKTAIL.   It was a huge scoop of packed fresh crab meat with cocktail sauce. Delicious!\n\nOur entrees came with either soup or salad.  I had the SALMON BISQUE and BF had the CLAM CHOWDER.  Let me just say that it was the best fish soup I've ever had!  Not fishy but creamy and really flavorful. BF loved his clam chowder which was not overly rich.\n\nFor our entrees, BF had the PARMESAN HALIBUT and I had the CALAMARI STEAK. Both seafood dishes came with a choice of rice, mashed potato or french fries They were really delicious and seasoned well. Tender and not tough or dry.\n\nI didn't finish my calamari steak because I HAD to eat dessert.  BF and I splurged.

My first experience there led me to the crab cakes which were melty hockey pucks of shellfishy glory, beautifully textured crab which obviously came from a legendary recipe.

He was very specific. \"I have traveled around the world many times and I'll dare say their Petrale Sole is one of the best I had anywhere.\" I have to try PC, as I can't ignore my doc's orders! The restaurant was not fancy schmancy. In fact, it was basically no frills and down-to-earth.... like starting dinner off with a boring loaf of sourdough with plain ol' butter. The quaint exterior of the building gave PC a charming and old-fashioned appearance, shrouded occasionally by the enveloping fog. The interior is congested with many tables and antique booths tightly jammed in every nook and cranny. It did exude a cozy and welcoming aura once you step inside not to mention the cool glass of complimentary white wine in your hands for having to wait for a table.\n\nI was amazed as to how simple the menu was. There were only three basic styles of cooking.... Baked or grilled or pan-fried.  Add in a couple of soups and salads and there you have it, the whole menu of PC in a nutshell.\n\nWe wanted to start off by sharing an order of saut\u00e9ed and pan-fried calamari steak. Since it appeared in the menu only as a dinner entr\u00e9e ($18.75), my server cleverly suggested ordering the entr\u00e9e without the sides and she knocked $6.00 off from the entr\u00e9e price. Sounded like a deal! Calamari is relatively cheap, in abundant supply and ecologically sustainable. PC's calamari was first pounded, egg washed and batter dipped and lightly fried to give the calamari a golden brown crust. In spite of its tough or rubbery reputation, the texture of PC's calamari was so super tender that a fork was all you needed. Coupled with the lip-smacking egg batter, the tender steak earned a well deserved 5 stars. I was told the abalone was prepared much the same way but at $45 a pop, I'd rather stick with calamari and try my luck at diving for abalone off the Mendocino coast!\n\nPetrale sole ($24.95), a Pacific Coast fish, is prized for its delicate, mild and sweet flavors. The fillets were quickly saut\u00e9ed and pan-fried with a sauce of white wine, shallots, butter and herbs. PC then plated the fillets with saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms, a sprinkling of capers and a gentle squeeze of lemon. The sauce wasn't overwhelming so I can still taste the natural flavor of the fish. Even though the prep sounded so simple, I can't somehow make it to taste this good at home! The carb of choice was rice pilaf that tasted exquisite like fried rice and good to soak up the excess sauce.  I guess my doc was right about the sole, though I think I had better elsewhere. (4 stars). Besides, the calamari had the edge! \n\nThe Spicy Red Snapper ($20.68) didn't have the \"wow\" flavor I'd hoped for but my wife said it was still a keeper in the menu.  I personally think that the fish was a tad over grilled and the meat a little drier than I would like. It was labeled as spicy but not in any true sense of the word. The outer crust of the snapper had a robust, tangy char of some kind of mixed Cajun spices and herbs, cayenne pepper perhaps being the most discernable. (3.5 stars). The red snapper's meat was a little firmer and did not have the melt-in-your-mouth quality like the sole.\n\nAll in all, a great seafood place.... the price is right; the food is unpretentious and seafood perfectly executed. I just love old established restaurants like this one.  Parking can be a challenge in this neighborhood.  No reservations are taken and the system is kinda funky and disorganized.

The regular menu looks excellent, though I tried something from the daily specials board. The choice is hard though. I had baked crab-stuffed salmon Newberg, which was heavenly. For desert, apple tart with a marzipan-y overtone and scrumptious ice cream. The service was great and the ambiance is everything it looks to be from the bus. It's pricey (entrees in the upper teens to 20s, unless you order the abalone at $40), but for a nice, upscale seafood meal, worth it. Glad it's in my neighborhood.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTook my mom to the Pacific Cafe for dinner while she was visiting from LA. Still a five star rating! Another lovely meal (fried scallops, red potatoes, shrimp louie salad and chocolate torte).

Everyone is soooo friendly, even the people who are waiting to eat. Very hard to find parking but that's SF. Just talking writing about this place makes me want to go there. We live about 4 blocks from Pacific Cafe.  A great place for fresh seafood. A place to take someone who is visiting SF. So far that is what we have done and everyone we have taken to this place, they also loved it. It's  great to go right when it is opening so that you don't have to wait. If you are the first to be seated you still get a glass of free wine, We did. If you come later it's a long wait but if you sip wine then it does not seem like you are waiting long.

No reservations accepted... I tried. \nSeated right away by a courteous greeter, the service by the waitress was efficient and attentive.  Definitely not a hipster joint, but a long lasting restaurant that is consistent & good. \n\nAt our table (of course I talked everyone out of a bite - and two in one instance). Nothing really exotic (they did have abalone on the menu)  well prepared, tasty & nicely presented dishes:\n\nSalmon & Prawns Combo  -  $23.75 - Nice  \"combo\" of fresh seafood flavors.\n\nFilet of Sole Newburg  -  $21.37 - a baked delight (kinda an old-school dish) - very nicely prepared ... not a drop of the sauce was left on the plate.\n\nCrab Louie  -  $24.00 - beautiful & tasty & GIANT\n\nSnapper Spicy  -  $18.98 - kinda not that spicy if your into the XXX of spicyness (probably not a real word) but tender & tasty.\n\nAccompanying soups /salad / fries rate a \"good\" comment. \n\nJust down the road ( 5 minute walk ) from the Legion of Honor museum, so after nourishing your eyes & mind with beauty at \"The Legion\", delight your taste buds and fill your belly at Pacific Cafe. \n\nhttp://legionofhonor.famsf.org/legion/exhibitions", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-10-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Alison had the Snapper Spicy with Clam Chowder and french fries.

The server brings you a complimentary glass of wine to start and lets you browse the daily and specials menu while you enjoy some homemade sour dough bread and creamy salty butter.  \n\nI ordered the Grilled Salmon (slathered with an herb-filled butter cream) and fried fresh prawns with Salmon Bisque and red potatoes.  Alison had the Snapper Spicy with Clam Chowder and french fries.  Both were totally delicious, the Snapper boasting a crisp, robust char of chili powders, pepper and herbs, the Salmon being a more modestly straight-forward piece of fish, wish the aforementioned slathering of garlic-herb-enhanced sweet cream butter.\n\nThe red potatoes were cooked to perfection, as were the fries, both delicate and crisp.  The prawns were delightfully butterflied and lightly fried.  The Salmon bisque had an incredibly delicate hint of fishiness, creaminess and small bits of salmon which worked well texturally.  The Clam Chowder was the surprise stand-out with it's stew-like consistency and taste - a flour and oil based flavor that reminds me of my own Mother's beef stew - with pieces of mussels and potatoes reminding the brain it is actually, in fact, a chowder.\n\nI will be back again, when lovely company deems it necessary.  The Pacific Cafe is one of those neighborhood joints you frequent when it's time to impress loved ones with simple, elegant food and an excellently laid-back, friendly environment.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-19"}], "salmon  prawns combo": []}
