Seriously, my friends used to tease me all the time but when you find that mix of budget friendly breakfast and coffee it has to be a staple. Too bad the last 3 times I've gone there I've been thoroughly disappointed. Once I ordered a mimosa only to discover that the orange juice had gone bad, really bad, which seriously killed my taste buds and appetite and the food portions were significantly smaller and more bland in flavor. The last time I went the coffee was old and the house potatoes were no longer thick cubes of garlic yumminess but instead thin slices of slightly burned crisps. Also my boyfriends over easy eggs came out fully cooked.

That is how I would describe this place. I have been wanting to come here and finally I have since I was in the neighborhood. It was definitely worth the trip and time. The service was great the cashier was very patient with us and did not rush our order especially the hot chocolates he made. I must say the chicken and waffle plate was worth the price because you are given half a chicken on top of the waffle. The gravy that was put on the side was the cherry on top for the chicken. The waffle was good as well it was not dry nor hard. The Canadian Bacon was pretty good and as well the bacon. My girlfriend enjoyed her food as well but I forgot what she had so I can not comment for her however, she did enjoy the omelette she had since she was craving it.
