And it is byob so we came prepared with our own bottle of wine and such!\n\nAmbiance- much smaller than mission location. \nSelf-serve place with smaller kitchen.

Who'd look at it when you have so many amazing meat choices. \nThey have kebobs, chicken /beef/lamb curries, biryanis (chicken, mutton) and $1 chai!! Zomg. So many to choose.

Need to be a little hotter in temp but it was tasty!!Two non indians including me tolerated that spice really well, if not loved it.\n\n2. Kabobs- nicely spiced. Tasty with loads of fresh onions and jalapenos.\n3. Chicken curry  - with jalapenos and fresh ginger slices on top. This was probably the spiciest dish we had on the table.\n4. Nihari with lamb shank- yummmm! This one came with a huge lamb shank. Again, so well spiced that curry is. Nice, thick, tasty with a kick. \n\nThe portions were nice and big. Massive even!! And the best part- they were all around $9-$11 per entr\u00e9e. I mean, wow! I'd probably skip the super spicy chicken next time. Or try a dish chicken dish but the rest were totally point on and mind blowing. \n\nDid I mention that they give you a pile of peppers with every dish? It's like an added bonus heat to already nicely spiced dishes. Actual spicy peppers. So hot, you wont stop eating! Yes, SF has so many Indian restaurants and yes, you can find amazing biryani else where. But since I've had their food in Mission, I've been hooked. And this place actually delivers for free. I've been there during a cold chilly spring time and didn't want to walk to this area, they delivered it.\n\nMinus one star for location/ambiance and for the service.

YOU DECIDE\n\nMy heart is breaking.  It really feels like I just broke up with someone I truly loved.  It wasn't the cockroach in my samosas that ended my relationship with Pakwan tonight, it was being called a complete idiot by the delivery person/manager(?).  Oh sure, he chose different words but in essence he said I ride the short bus.  Here's how the break-up went down:\n\nAfter feverishly devouring one samosa in my dimly lit kitchen (lesson 1: do not eat take-out in dimly lit areas) I moved to the living room to start on the second.  The light from the t.v. grew brighter during a commercial break and cast its glow on the soggy cardboard box that held my remaining samosa...a familiar shape was distinguished in the illumination - it looked like a small cockroach.  I thought my mind was playing tricks on me so I went back to the kitchen and threw on the light - it was a cockroach, not too big - a teenager I would guess.  It was about an inch long and met its fate earlier than most of its kind, yet how could one go out more gloriously than in a pair of Pakwan samosas?  Nay!  Not possible.\n\nLike any surprised and moderately disgusted customer, wondering if I had perhaps already consumed one of the intruders' friends, I called the restaurant to say that despite being a regular patron, on this occasion there was a cockroach in my food, that I was throwing it all out, so please do not charge me for it.  I was told by a woman that the delivery driver would call me back.  (This is where my assumption of the delivery driver being the managers arises).  The phone call I soon received, not the cockroach, is why I will never again solicit the deliciously spicy Chicken Makhanwala from Pakwan.\n\nA man called me, said he just delivered the food and asked what happened.  I told him I often called the restaurant, he said \"I know - I deliver to your house\" and I said that there was a cockroach in my samosas this time.  He said \"Oh, no, no - it's a spice.  It's a cardamom seed.\"  As shocked as I was to hear not an apology but that I was in fact retarded, not being able to tell an herb from a living critter, I said \"Sir, it's a cockroach - I'm looking at it, it's not a cardamom seed.\" He was then impelled to tell me that I didn't  know what cardamom looked like, that many people think they see a bug in their food but that it's just cardamom.  He laughed.  I said, \"Sir, it has legs.  I can see it's antennas.\"  After already having told me about 3 times that it wasn't a cockroach, he then told me he didn't want to argue about what it was or wasn't.  (Lesson 2: Your meal can get worse than finding a cockroach in it, no really, it can) I begged him to come back to my apartment and pick up the food.  I told him I wanted him to see it since he was telling me that I didn't know what I was looking at.  He told me he wasn't near my house and asked me if I wanted a credit.\n\nThe difficult thing is that I'm a reasonable person - I understand that restaurants are places that keep large amounts of food and from time to time they will have issues with little critters wanting to get at that food, but being a reasonable person, I simply wanted an apology and an offer to correct the issue.  What I got was insulted and argued with and I had to tell the gentleman that I wouldn't be calling them anymore.  I went so far as to tell him that I had considered it a one-off incident but that with him insulting my intelligence, as if I couldn't identify a cockroach, I would no longer be giving them my business.\n\nThis is a sad day.  I understand that there is little \"service\" left in the food industry, we are supposed to be happy just to get the food we order, never mind expect it to be hot or bug-free, but to have a manager argue with me (a repeat customer who has recommended their place countless times!) as if I were stupid is just too low.\n\nIn summation I must say that although the food at Pakwan is amazing - it just doesn't compensate for poor service or flat out insults.  Adieu Pakwan!  Parting is such sweet sorrow...I hope that someone on the staff endeavors to enroll in \"Customer Service 101\" and seeks to entreat future customers with more respect than I was given.  As the Kluminator says, \"I'm sorry, you are out\".\n\nIf anyone has a good recipe for Chicken Makhanwala, send it my way - I will be making my own from here on out.", "rating": 1, "date": "2008-06-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The tastest chicken kebob boti me and my husband ever had and excelent chicken makhanwala great ordering for delivery and to-go."], "author": "Diane M.", "review": "The tastest chicken kebob boti me and my husband ever had and excelent chicken makhanwala great ordering for delivery and to-go.", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-09-22"}, {"excerpts": ["have been coming here for years, mostly for the chicken makhanwala, which is beyond heavenly.
