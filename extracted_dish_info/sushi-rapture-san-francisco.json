Again, we just thought it was the restaurant.\n\nOnce we get the bill, we realized that they had charged us for the DEEP-FRIED scallops -- an entr\u00e9e, which was $10 more. We tell them that they made a huge mistake. We ask if they can reduce the payment to $8 (which was how much it originally cost), and we'll just give them a bigger tip. They go back to ask, and tell us scallops are really expensive (which I understand), and said that they would give us a $2 discount. REALLY? A $2 DISCOUNT, when it was YOUR fault?

The Snake Roll, combining salmon, spicy tuna and cilantro was delicious and fresh.  The creamy roll, pairing spicy tuna and scallops was a surprise recommendation.  As an Englishman in this fair land I sometimes take offense at the number of things that you people like to deep fry (see also: Paula Deen, urgh).  However, this roll is dropped in the fryer before being served to give it a crispy seaweed covered coating and it was fantastic!  The warmth just penetrates the skins and outer rice but leaves the fish cool and raw on the inside.  I would seriously order one of these at a ball game if they stuck it in a bun and called it a Tokyo Dog.\n\nAs well as our Maki, we ordered two of the Special Nigiri.  The United featured Hamachi wrapped around rice with Tobiko, Black Tobiko and Wasabi Tobiko on top.  The Pumpkin was Salmon with a Spicy Scallop dressing on top.  Both of these were amazing and unlike other sushi dishes I see in the majority of restaurants.  The flavor combinations are a mixture of the traditional and modern, which would certainly appeal to the neighborhood crowd and are perfectly executed every time.\n\nWe finished our meal with a couple of Mochi Ice Creams, mango and red bean.  The mango was wonderful palate cleanser and the red bean left a delicious chocolatey taste in my mouth for the short stroll home (downhill thankfully).\n\nThe bill came to $28 a head including tip which i think is extremely reasonable for such high quality, well presented sushi.  I will most certainly be returning, shortly I expect, and will be ordering a Tokyo Dog with a selection of the remaining Special Nigiris.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-04-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Woah creamy roll!
