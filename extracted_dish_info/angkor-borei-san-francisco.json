It tasted like peanut butter and fish sauce with sugar. Nothing special about it.\n\nCharbroiled pork: best dish we had.

Original, not so much.  I've had this dish at Thai restaurants before and loved it then.

", "It's a little salty and a tad sweet, but it's missing the spiciness and acidity. "], "author": "Jessie L.", "review": "TLDR - Good, flavorful Cambodian food! Try the charbroiled pork slices and the ahmohk!\n\nEver since visiting Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago, I've had cravings on and off for Thai and Cambodian food. You don't see a lot of restaurants labelled as Cambodian in SF (or in the states in general, I'm guessing), so I was pretty excited when I found Angkor Borei. I'm ashamed to say I don't really know the difference between Thai and Cambodian food (they seemed pretty similar where I went in the two countries), but Angkor Borei did a solid job satisfying my cravings.\n\nThe restaurant is your typical Asian restaurant - no frills, probably family-owned/run - and easily overlooked from the outside unless you're specifically looking for it. My group of 5 came around 6pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was surprisingly quiet and empty. A lady, who I assume to be the owner, told us that most of her customers dine a lot later, and true to her word, the restaurant got a lot busier around 7:30-8pm. Also to my surprise, parking was very difficult to find, despite it being in the outskirts of SF.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive here, like at most Asian restaurants, but I had some pretty specific cravings: papaya salad, tom yum soup, fish amok and pumpkin curry. We also ordered the charbroiled pork per Yelp's suggestion, the claypot shrimp for some more seafood, asparagus for some veggies and mango sticky rice for dessert. \n\nMost of the dishes were pretty good and flavorful, but I'd definitely have to recommend the AHMOHK and CHARBROILED PORK SLICES. Both had great texture and flavor. I also loved that the food in general here wasn't greasy! Most Thai restaurants in the States use a ridiculous amount of oil in their cooking, which was not actually the case in Thailand. Portions are a little on the smaller side given the price and in comparison to similar restaurants, but still very reasonable.\n\nThe thai iced tea ($4.45) is pretty sweet here, but I loved the coconut ($4.45) - refreshing and they give you a spoon to scoop out all the coconut meat!\n\n#5 NHOAM LAHONG / PAPAYA SALAD ($7.95) - 4/5\nPretty solid. Ingredients are fresh but it's lacking some of the complexity in flavor that papaya salads are supposed to have. It's a little salty and a tad sweet, but it's missing the spiciness and acidity. Still liked it though!\n\n#13 SPICY HOT & SOUR SOUP ($11.95) - 4/5\nBasically like Thai tom yum soup. Light but flavorful soup. Sour and a little bit spicy, but definitely could've used more spiciness.\n\n#30 CHARBROILED PORK SLICES ($9.75) - 5/5\nMMM. If you love meat, I definitely recommend this! The pork was super tender (with very little fat) and absolutely delicious. Not greasy either! Tasted amazing on its own or with the sweet and sour/acidic sauce it was served with. \n\n#48 AHMOHK ($12.95) - 5/5\nOn 7x7's list of things to eat in SF. I had fish amok for the first time in Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago and I've been craving it ever since. It's not something I normally see at Thai restaurants in the states (or maybe I just never looked for it on the menu before), so I was really excited to see it on the menu here. It's not quite as good as authentic amok, but it definitely didn't disappoint! The amok was rich and flavorful with a perfectly light, creamy mousse texture. The fish was soft and moist, and there was shrimp and scallops in the amok too. Only weird thing was the random piece of broccoli at the bottom. Paired with a salty fish sauce, but I wouldn't add that to the amok. \n\n#53 CLAYPOT SHRIMP ($12.95) - 3/5\nNothing bad about it but nothing particularly interesting at all. Just some steamed shrimp and steamed veggies, served with some sort of sour sauce, but otherwise rather plain and flavorless without the sauce. Great healthy option though. \n\n#65 ASPARAGUS SAUTEED WITH SPICES & COCONUT MILK ($9.95) - 3/5\nServed with your choice of meat (chicken, beef, pork or squid) but my group chose to leave out the meat. Pretty much tasted like the pumpkin curry. Nothing special and not sure if asparagus is really authentic to Cambodia (I definitely didn't see anything asparagus while I was there)\n\nPUMPKIN CURRY ($14.95) - 3.5/5\nSolid but didn't stand out that much. The curry was light rather than creamy/heavy and pretty flavorful, and the pumpkin had a nice soft texture. We got ours with chicken, which was just okay. \n\nMANGO STICKY RICE ($4.95) - 3.5/5\nNot bad but not authentic.. Rather than actual sticky rice, they used purple rice, which isn't sticky and has a firmer texture than sticky rice. The mango was fresh and very ripe and sweet though, and the cream was sweet and salty.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Three stars for the Nhoam Lahong (green papaya salad).

I mention this because you can't help noticing that you can get delicious food everywhere in Thailand, even from street carts, but once you get to Cambodia the food choices are dreary. Can I tell you about the time I got rice left over from another table and soup made from the bones of someone else's chicken? How about the time I ordered a chicken and saw them catch, kill, and cook a giant rooster that ended up being inedible tough. Or the numerous times I've eaten grey chunks of buffalo. Cambodia is a poor country and when you travel there you learn pretty quick to look for the expensive by Cambodian standards Chinese restaurants or the cafe's catering to western customers and even then you still get plenty of surprises, if you ever see a sign in Cambodia that says \"happy pizza\" on it go in and order a pizza with extra happy.\n\nThe reason I'm going into this whole tirade is because I can't tell you if Angkor Borei is authentic Cambodian food or not, it is not by my experience but I don't know what well off Cambodians have their cooks make for them or what the food was like before the country was ravaged by war and the Khmer Rouge. \n\nWe ordered the crispy Cambodian crepe; I thought it was interesting but just ok.

", "Light but flavorful soup. "], "author": "Jessie L.", "review": "TLDR - Good, flavorful Cambodian food! Try the charbroiled pork slices and the ahmohk!\n\nEver since visiting Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago, I've had cravings on and off for Thai and Cambodian food. You don't see a lot of restaurants labelled as Cambodian in SF (or in the states in general, I'm guessing), so I was pretty excited when I found Angkor Borei. I'm ashamed to say I don't really know the difference between Thai and Cambodian food (they seemed pretty similar where I went in the two countries), but Angkor Borei did a solid job satisfying my cravings.\n\nThe restaurant is your typical Asian restaurant - no frills, probably family-owned/run - and easily overlooked from the outside unless you're specifically looking for it. My group of 5 came around 6pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was surprisingly quiet and empty. A lady, who I assume to be the owner, told us that most of her customers dine a lot later, and true to her word, the restaurant got a lot busier around 7:30-8pm. Also to my surprise, parking was very difficult to find, despite it being in the outskirts of SF.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive here, like at most Asian restaurants, but I had some pretty specific cravings: papaya salad, tom yum soup, fish amok and pumpkin curry. We also ordered the charbroiled pork per Yelp's suggestion, the claypot shrimp for some more seafood, asparagus for some veggies and mango sticky rice for dessert. \n\nMost of the dishes were pretty good and flavorful, but I'd definitely have to recommend the AHMOHK and CHARBROILED PORK SLICES. Both had great texture and flavor. I also loved that the food in general here wasn't greasy! Most Thai restaurants in the States use a ridiculous amount of oil in their cooking, which was not actually the case in Thailand. Portions are a little on the smaller side given the price and in comparison to similar restaurants, but still very reasonable.\n\nThe thai iced tea ($4.45) is pretty sweet here, but I loved the coconut ($4.45) - refreshing and they give you a spoon to scoop out all the coconut meat!\n\n#5 NHOAM LAHONG / PAPAYA SALAD ($7.95) - 4/5\nPretty solid. Ingredients are fresh but it's lacking some of the complexity in flavor that papaya salads are supposed to have. It's a little salty and a tad sweet, but it's missing the spiciness and acidity. Still liked it though!\n\n#13 SPICY HOT & SOUR SOUP ($11.95) - 4/5\nBasically like Thai tom yum soup. Light but flavorful soup. Sour and a little bit spicy, but definitely could've used more spiciness.\n\n#30 CHARBROILED PORK SLICES ($9.75) - 5/5\nMMM. If you love meat, I definitely recommend this! The pork was super tender (with very little fat) and absolutely delicious. Not greasy either! Tasted amazing on its own or with the sweet and sour/acidic sauce it was served with. \n\n#48 AHMOHK ($12.95) - 5/5\nOn 7x7's list of things to eat in SF. I had fish amok for the first time in Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago and I've been craving it ever since. It's not something I normally see at Thai restaurants in the states (or maybe I just never looked for it on the menu before), so I was really excited to see it on the menu here. It's not quite as good as authentic amok, but it definitely didn't disappoint! The amok was rich and flavorful with a perfectly light, creamy mousse texture. The fish was soft and moist, and there was shrimp and scallops in the amok too. Only weird thing was the random piece of broccoli at the bottom. Paired with a salty fish sauce, but I wouldn't add that to the amok. \n\n#53 CLAYPOT SHRIMP ($12.95) - 3/5\nNothing bad about it but nothing particularly interesting at all. Just some steamed shrimp and steamed veggies, served with some sort of sour sauce, but otherwise rather plain and flavorless without the sauce. Great healthy option though. \n\n#65 ASPARAGUS SAUTEED WITH SPICES & COCONUT MILK ($9.95) - 3/5\nServed with your choice of meat (chicken, beef, pork or squid) but my group chose to leave out the meat. Pretty much tasted like the pumpkin curry. Nothing special and not sure if asparagus is really authentic to Cambodia (I definitely didn't see anything asparagus while I was there)\n\nPUMPKIN CURRY ($14.95) - 3.5/5\nSolid but didn't stand out that much. The curry was light rather than creamy/heavy and pretty flavorful, and the pumpkin had a nice soft texture. We got ours with chicken, which was just okay. \n\nMANGO STICKY RICE ($4.95) - 3.5/5\nNot bad but not authentic.. Rather than actual sticky rice, they used purple rice, which isn't sticky and has a firmer texture than sticky rice. The mango was fresh and very ripe and sweet though, and the cream was sweet and salty.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["I love this place, particularly the pumpkin curry, hot and sour soup and crispy Cambodian crepe.

I'm not sure I would go that far, but it was definitely cooked very well. The fish was nice and tender; however I'm used to a little more custard to fish ratio. That being said, you're getting your money's worth with how much fish they give you in that little banana leaf.\n\nPumpkin curry - We really enjoyed this dish as the curry was nicely flavored but it came on a pumpkin shell that you could eat. That part really added to the dish as we were able to scoop delicious chunks of pumpkin with our curry. Yum.\n\nPrahok - A Cambodian staple, converted a bit to suit non native tongues. If you don't know what prahok is, it's a fermented fish paste that leaves a very pungent smell. It was mixed with ground pork and some coconut milk to reduce the pungency and used to dip various vegetables with it. Still pretty tasty!\n\nOverall, I do live in San Jose and would I return?

I think I'm just not a fan of lemon grass though. \n\nAhmohk (10.95) - I never had a fish curry mousse before! This came out looking like a cupcake. I loved the soft texture!

Honestly I have never been to Cambodia so I wouldn't be able to comment on authenticity but it all tasted good at least :). I would definitely recommend trying Ahmohk if you want something different! The Cambodian crepe is also a good one to try. The curry was good but I would say it's not too different from Thai curry so not a must try.

Ugh, what a waste.\n\nOddly enough, the only Cambodian restaurant in San Francisco is located in the outskirts of The Mission and not in TL's Little Saigon. \n\nCambodian food is very similar to Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Angkor has a well-rounded menu including a vegetarian menu with mock meats. Absolutely no MSG is used as I confirmed it with the owner who said she avoids using this as it gives her headaches. She said, I would be able to \"feel it\" IF they use MSG (some Asian restaurants claim to use no MSG but they do) and she was right. I didn't get the heart palpitations, dry mouth, and headaches as I usually do with Asian food. Whoo hoo, bonus points!\n\nYou can normally tell if an ethnic restaurant is legit if there's natives dining there; I saw none and we were one of the only two Asian parties. And looking through reviews written by Khmer natives, it seems Angkor serves more Americanized Cambodian food which was obvious as some dishes really lacked the big, bold flavors present in Southeast Asian cuisine.

Forget the raw veggies you're supposed to use for dipping and slather this thick, creamy pork concoction over your rice (they have brown rice). The anchovies gave this dish a surprisingly mouth-watering, salty punch that was purely addicting.\n\nThe Pumpkin Curry w/ Shrimp was a second fav. I didn't care for the shrimp because it was all about the rich, savory coconuty sauce and the sweet, tender kabocha it was served in.

Try the charbroiled pork slices and the ahmohk!\n\nEver since visiting Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago, I've had cravings on and off for Thai and Cambodian food. You don't see a lot of restaurants labelled as Cambodian in SF (or in the states in general, I'm guessing), so I was pretty excited when I found Angkor Borei. I'm ashamed to say I don't really know the difference between Thai and Cambodian food (they seemed pretty similar where I went in the two countries), but Angkor Borei did a solid job satisfying my cravings.\n\nThe restaurant is your typical Asian restaurant - no frills, probably family-owned/run - and easily overlooked from the outside unless you're specifically looking for it. My group of 5 came around 6pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was surprisingly quiet and empty. A lady, who I assume to be the owner, told us that most of her customers dine a lot later, and true to her word, the restaurant got a lot busier around 7:30-8pm. Also to my surprise, parking was very difficult to find, despite it being in the outskirts of SF.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive here, like at most Asian restaurants, but I had some pretty specific cravings: papaya salad, tom yum soup, fish amok and pumpkin curry. We also ordered the charbroiled pork per Yelp's suggestion, the claypot shrimp for some more seafood, asparagus for some veggies and mango sticky rice for dessert. \n\nMost of the dishes were pretty good and flavorful, but I'd definitely have to recommend the AHMOHK and CHARBROILED PORK SLICES. Both had great texture and flavor. I also loved that the food in general here wasn't greasy! Most Thai restaurants in the States use a ridiculous amount of oil in their cooking, which was not actually the case in Thailand. Portions are a little on the smaller side given the price and in comparison to similar restaurants, but still very reasonable.\n\nThe thai iced tea ($4.45) is pretty sweet here, but I loved the coconut ($4.45) - refreshing and they give you a spoon to scoop out all the coconut meat!\n\n#5 NHOAM LAHONG / PAPAYA SALAD ($7.95) - 4/5\nPretty solid. Ingredients are fresh but it's lacking some of the complexity in flavor that papaya salads are supposed to have. It's a little salty and a tad sweet, but it's missing the spiciness and acidity. Still liked it though!\n\n#13 SPICY HOT & SOUR SOUP ($11.95) - 4/5\nBasically like Thai tom yum soup. Light but flavorful soup. Sour and a little bit spicy, but definitely could've used more spiciness.\n\n#30 CHARBROILED PORK SLICES ($9.75) - 5/5\nMMM. If you love meat, I definitely recommend this! The pork was super tender (with very little fat) and absolutely delicious. Not greasy either! Tasted amazing on its own or with the sweet and sour/acidic sauce it was served with. \n\n#48 AHMOHK ($12.95) - 5/5\nOn 7x7's list of things to eat in SF. I had fish amok for the first time in Thailand and Cambodia a few months ago and I've been craving it ever since. It's not something I normally see at Thai restaurants in the states (or maybe I just never looked for it on the menu before), so I was really excited to see it on the menu here. It's not quite as good as authentic amok, but it definitely didn't disappoint! The amok was rich and flavorful with a perfectly light, creamy mousse texture. The fish was soft and moist, and there was shrimp and scallops in the amok too. Only weird thing was the random piece of broccoli at the bottom. Paired with a salty fish sauce, but I wouldn't add that to the amok. \n\n#53 CLAYPOT SHRIMP ($12.95) - 3/5\nNothing bad about it but nothing particularly interesting at all. Just some steamed shrimp and steamed veggies, served with some sort of sour sauce, but otherwise rather plain and flavorless without the sauce. Great healthy option though. \n\n#65 ASPARAGUS SAUTEED WITH SPICES & COCONUT MILK ($9.95) - 3/5\nServed with your choice of meat (chicken, beef, pork or squid) but my group chose to leave out the meat. Pretty much tasted like the pumpkin curry. Nothing special and not sure if asparagus is really authentic to Cambodia (I definitely didn't see anything asparagus while I was there)\n\nPUMPKIN CURRY ($14.95) - 3.5/5\nSolid but didn't stand out that much. The curry was light rather than creamy/heavy and pretty flavorful, and the pumpkin had a nice soft texture. We got ours with chicken, which was just okay. \n\nMANGO STICKY RICE ($4.95) - 3.5/5\nNot bad but not authentic.. Rather than actual sticky rice, they used purple rice, which isn't sticky and has a firmer texture than sticky rice. The mango was fresh and very ripe and sweet though, and the cream was sweet and salty.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["For entrees, we got the chili chicken curry, charbroiled pork slices, ahmohk (a curry fish mousse served in a banana leaf), and dried beancurd with sauteed vegetables.

The dishes were very similar to Thai and Vietnamese food. Our group of six was very open to the server's suggestions, so we basically left the ordering up to her. \n\nFor starters, we had the fresh spinach leaves which was served on a plate with 7 small bowls, each filled with different items: ginger, peanuts, lime wedges, red onion, chili, dried shrimp, toasted coconut. We filled our leaves of spinach with each item, topped it off with the chef's special tamarind sauce and popped them into our mouths. The items were all very complementary and the sauce gave it an extra kick. We also ordered the squid salad, which was very spicy and very tasty. My favorite starter was the crispy Cambodian crepe, the crepe skin was very crisp and the shrimp, ground pork, tofu, and bean sprouts inside were delicious.\n\nFor entrees, we got the chili chicken curry, charbroiled pork slices, ahmohk (a curry fish mousse served in a banana leaf), and dried beancurd with sauteed vegetables. The ahmohk was very unique, and I enjoyed the different textures. However, I don't think it was the winner at our table. Our server had suggested it, saying it was one of their most popular dishes. If you're looking for a different dish, then you should try it. The dried beancurd was so yummy that we ordered another one after we polished off the first one. The chicken and pork were also quite good, and are good \"safe\" items to order. \n\nFor dessert, we got an order of their fried banana with coconut ice cream and sticky mango rice. I was already stuffed from our meal that I could only manage to take a small bite out of both. The batter for the fried banana was a bit to heavy for my liking. The coconut ice cream was creamy and smooth. The mango rice was good, better than the one I've had at Osha Thai. \n\nOur bill arrived and it came out to $17 per person.

Ugh, what a waste.\n\nOddly enough, the only Cambodian restaurant in San Francisco is located in the outskirts of The Mission and not in TL's Little Saigon. \n\nCambodian food is very similar to Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Angkor has a well-rounded menu including a vegetarian menu with mock meats. Absolutely no MSG is used as I confirmed it with the owner who said she avoids using this as it gives her headaches. She said, I would be able to \"feel it\" IF they use MSG (some Asian restaurants claim to use no MSG but they do) and she was right. I didn't get the heart palpitations, dry mouth, and headaches as I usually do with Asian food. Whoo hoo, bonus points!\n\nYou can normally tell if an ethnic restaurant is legit if there's natives dining there; I saw none and we were one of the only two Asian parties. And looking through reviews written by Khmer natives, it seems Angkor serves more Americanized Cambodian food which was obvious as some dishes really lacked the big, bold flavors present in Southeast Asian cuisine. However, they do use a lot of anchovies as a base for many of their dishes so you may a detect a pungent saltiness in some dishes and sauces.\n\nF O O D\nWe ordered a total of 12 dishes for our group of 6; doubling up on some: http://bit.ly/VnUv9O.

Forget the raw veggies you're supposed to use for dipping and slather this thick, creamy pork concoction over your rice (they have brown rice). The anchovies gave this dish a surprisingly mouth-watering, salty punch that was purely addicting.\n\nThe Pumpkin Curry w/ Shrimp was a second fav. I didn't care for the shrimp because it was all about the rich, savory coconuty sauce and the sweet, tender kabocha it was served in. It definitely needed more of a kick though as the curry was too mild.\n\nThe guys loved and killed two orders of the Duck Prik King which was basically Chinese roast duck in a savory, slightly spicy red curry sauce and green beans.

A dish that I grew up eating and something my mom always cooks when I return to Seattle. I do wish there was a catfish option and I wish there was some more flavor it in, meaning more of the tamarind flavor. The version at Phnom Penh House in Oakland is much better.\n\nAmok - Another friend of mine mentioned that it was probably the best amok she's ever had before, even in Cambodia. I'm not sure I would go that far, but it was definitely cooked very well. The fish was nice and tender; however I'm used to a little more custard to fish ratio. That being said, you're getting your money's worth with how much fish they give you in that little banana leaf.\n\nPumpkin curry - We really enjoyed this dish as the curry was nicely flavored but it came on a pumpkin shell that you could eat. That part really added to the dish as we were able to scoop delicious chunks of pumpkin with our curry. Yum.\n\nPrahok - A Cambodian staple, converted a bit to suit non native tongues.

It was very different than the previous versions that I have had. It was served over lettuce, very similar to a Thai beef salad. Previous versions I have had were served sizzling, stir-fried with onions and some other veggies, but this one was more of a salad. I liked it a lot anyway, but it was not what I had expected. \n\nOverall, we ordered a very authentic Cambodian meal, which I love them for having. Many Cambodian restaurants in SoCal are Chinese and claim that Cambodian and Chinese foods are difficult to differentiate. Dishes like these, however, that are native to Camobodia (as far as I know) are not served there. They definitely get props for that as well as the amazing service and recreating a Cambodian vibe all the way over here. However, the food just was not amazing. It was good, but just not impressive enough to draw us back. Also, the portions were really small, especially considering the prices. We were hungry again later that evening. This was my first chance to really impress the wifey with the amazing food that I experienced over there and it just really didn't do the trick.

The dishes were very similar to Thai and Vietnamese food. Our group of six was very open to the server's suggestions, so we basically left the ordering up to her. \n\nFor starters, we had the fresh spinach leaves which was served on a plate with 7 small bowls, each filled with different items: ginger, peanuts, lime wedges, red onion, chili, dried shrimp, toasted coconut. We filled our leaves of spinach with each item, topped it off with the chef's special tamarind sauce and popped them into our mouths. The items were all very complementary and the sauce gave it an extra kick. We also ordered the squid salad, which was very spicy and very tasty.

The coconut ice cream was creamy and smooth. The mango rice was good, better than the one I've had at Osha Thai. \n\nOur bill arrived and it came out to $17 per person.

While the 7x7's Ahmok: Fish Curry Mousse had deliciously tender flakes of fish, the texture was more like a quiche than a mousse. I was not impressed.\n\nRedeeming this, was the Prahok: Stewed Pork in Coconut Milk w/ Anchovies. Forget the raw veggies you're supposed to use for dipping and slather this thick, creamy pork concoction over your rice (they have brown rice). The anchovies gave this dish a surprisingly mouth-watering, salty punch that was purely addicting.\n\nThe Pumpkin Curry w/ Shrimp was a second fav. I didn't care for the shrimp because it was all about the rich, savory coconuty sauce and the sweet, tender kabocha it was served in. It definitely needed more of a kick though as the curry was too mild.\n\nThe guys loved and killed two orders of the Duck Prik King which was basically Chinese roast duck in a savory, slightly spicy red curry sauce and green beans. You can never go wrong with rich, fatty duck right?\n\nOh and if you must order an appetizer, get the Fresh Spinach Leaves. Nothing says, \"sexy\" like eating with your hands. Build your own Cambodian spinach \"taco\" with dried shrimp, peanuts, ginger, lime, red onion, bell peppers and toasted coconut and dip it into the sweet and sour sauce for a tasty textural sensation in the mouth.\n\nS E R V I C E\nWearing traditional Cambodian Sampots (long cloth worn as a skirt), the owner and staff were very welcoming and friendly as well as socially engaging.
