I knew there would be a wait, especially for a group, and everybody was apprised of this and impressed with the coffee-while-you-wait setup. We actually didn't wait too long, since we compromised the group dynamic by having 3 volunteers sit at the bar while the rest of us took a table. \n\nI'm also not complaining about the rapid changes to the neighborhood and is demographics, startling as they were. We actually found parking quickly, and the babies were all cute enough.

I ordered the \"Special Scramble #1,\" which is basically 3 eggs, spinach, mushrooms, shrimp, and crab cake bits all scrambled and covered with hollandaise. Yum, right? I know, and I was really looking forward to dipping my home fries in some yolky, buttery, lemon-scented goodness. And then my food came.\n\nHollandaise sauce is made of egg yolks, butter, and lemon juice. All three of these foods are extremely YELLOW in color, and when emulsified into a sauce should coat a spoon or finger, like thick gravy or melted ice cream. I've eaten hollandaise sauce in many different places and at many different times. Some has been sublime, other sub par, and as long as it's not chunky I can usually cope. But never, ever, EVER have I encountered GRAY HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. Yes, gray. And chunky, like watery ricotta. It was like the discharge of various STDs is often described, actually. It was totally gonorrhea sauce. \n\nI sent my plate back before it even hit the table. I said, \"This is wrong, the sauce is broken.\" That was a vast understatement of what was the matter, but I figured any cook could look at my plate and instantly know what the problem was. However, when my plate came back it was simply with naked eggs---and A GIANT SIDE OF THE GRAY HOLLANDAISE. It looked exactly like the sides of grits other people were getting. I stuck my finger in the bowl to demonstrate that it was not a proper sauce, and got a finger full of grease and chunks of what appeared to be cooked egg yolks. It tasted and smelled like hard-boiled eggs. Who the fuck would serve that to somebody? Who the fuck would want that on their eggs? I told the runner they needed to make a new batch, and proceeded to eat my unsauced eggs.\n\nA few moments later a server came by, and told me that the kitchen could not make more hollandaise, that this was the batch for the day. OK, I know that this shit sits around, and I accept that fact because I love hollandaise and it usually doesn't make too much of a difference. But what I got should have been thrown out before it ever hit my plate, and I suspect it was never right to begin with. Plus, it only takes about 30 seconds to make, especially in the blender. I told the waitress that if they weren't going to make more sauce they needed to stop serving it to people, and at that point I didn't just mean me, I meant anybody who happened to eat at this restaurant that I've been raving about for 4 years---but then I saw a benedict come out, covered with the ghastly gray stuff.  \n\nIt makes me sad to see Just For You go downhill like that. You used to be able to taste the love, and now I detect a hint of absentee ownership and cheap kitchen labor. They've also taken my favorite sandwich, the veggie reuben, off of the menu.

As a Baton Rouge native and former New Orleans resident, I have noticed that the beignets can be somewhat off. Sometimes they are great and sometimes they are a bit yeasty.\n\nHowever, I have found a pattern to the problem and a simple reason behind it. Apparently, beignet quality is determined partly by ambient humidity. When it is raining or drizzling out, the beignets are excellent. If it's sunny, better to skip them. It's always humid in Louisiana so it's not a problem there.\n\nI would prefer if the beignets were served with a powdered sugar shaker, as they always are in Louisiana. Sometimes the sugar doesn't cover the top of the beignet and sometimes it's all over the plate but not all over the beignet. It's nearly impossible to get powdered sugar off the plate with a beignet. If it does not come from above it doesn't stick.\n\nOther food there is not humidity sensitive and some of it is pretty good. I don't find many places here that offer grits and sometimes grits really hit the spot. (And no, I have never been to prison.) Always grits with cheese, please.

Fun decor - great concert and movie posters, and it took me (because i'm so quick) a long time to recognize the fake bear in the back of the photo with the woman stealthfully holding the enormous fish (look for it!). \n\nYou can get huevos rancheros, which are very different from the usual but have a quality of its own, and you can ask for Hatch green chile sauce, from a town in New Mexico, which has a subtle flavor and kick, or more standard red. Lots of great dishes such as the Greg's Omelettes, Crab Cakes, Breakfast Burritos, Cowgirl, and many more. I'm not a coffee drinker but i hear people always being asked if they want light or dark roast - and i often get the Organic Carrot Apple Juice, as flavorful as it is healthy.\n\nVery flexible on mixing and matching side dishes. Great lunch specials. Amazing homemade soups you could write home about. Intelligent, engaging, fun, smart, sophisticated, very experienced manager and staff. Famous for their Beignets. Very cooperative on to-go orders, large or small.\n\nOwner is a real for-real chef, who after owning and operating for years, finally found that manager she can trust and even takes vacations now (well deserved). The chefs and cooks on duty are great, and they've been educated in cookery and recipes by her - and the breads, including Cornbread, are fresh-baked on location by a fresh baker baking freshly. \n\nAnd the customers are also smart and friendly.

Still, I could only eat about 2/3 of the omelet before giving up (of course, I first looted all of the crab cake from inside the last 1/3 too).

It is not pretentious (I wear sweats most of the time I go there) Customers are very friendly too.\n\n3. Coffee is quite different than the typical coffee that I've had. I know someone who knows the owner of the restaurant and they say that she gets the coffee from New Orleans.\n\n4. There is a decent wait and a list that you have to put your name on, and yes I know waiting sucks but it is a good sign if there is a wait because that means the food is worth waiting for by locals plus they give you free coffee outside...unlike Mama's on Washington Square.\n\nBasically, whenever my family comes out to visit me I always take them there and I will be going there until they either close or I move.

I been eatin' here and there, and one of the most recent joints was Good For Your Cafe, and I DID NOT leave unsatisfied! \n\nMe and the GF wanted some breakfast and wanted to try to hit up a new place, so a friend / fellow foodie suggested this cafe, said it was \"hella good\". We found it pretty easily and with parking right in front (it was 730am, so naturally we were the early birds, no lines, no wait, smooth service). So we get in, sit down, and READ the menu, while at the same time wiping off the drool that would fall onto the menu. The menu is extensive and very appetizing to read. After a few minutes of, \"what do you think?\", \"I dunno...?\", and \"this or that?\", we finally made our decisions. \n\nI got the chili and scrambled eggs, and the GF goes for the huevos rancheros, and since this place claims to be \"the best beignets in the city\", we ordered 2 for desert (or is it dessert?) Both dishes were plentiful, no need to eat more than your share, lest you plan to roll out in a wheelchair. \n\nSo I get my dish and dig in... awesome! The chili is beefy with the right amount of tang and a little spice. Underneath the chili was chopped onion, and then the scrambled egg, which was seasoned just right, and with perfect fluff. Then there was the cheese melted all over, which was good enough to make the dish dee-lish (I mean who doesn't love cheese, right?). However, what really brought the dish together and put on another level to set it apart from all other scrambled egg dishes, was the homemade cornbread lying underneath this savory concoction! The cornbread was fresh, fluffy, and sweet, which worked as the perfect companion with the tangy and subtle spice of the chili. The entire dish reacts wonderfully together, and if left me full and ready for a nap (I normally don't wake up this early). \n\nThe GF's plate, the huevos rancheros was also well done. The sauce that went with the eggs had just the right spice, no need for Tabasco with that sauce! However, the tortilla didn't really do much for the plate, and of course you need a tortilla for a plate like this if you plan on calling it \"huevos rancheros\", but then again I am being bias in my assessment. What can I say, I grew up on homemade huevos rancheros by a Latina mother. Either way, both dishes were great. \n\nFinally, after feeling like we're going to explode, we remembered our beignets... should left some room, but then again, Im'a trooper! So we got our beignets, super fresh and moist from the kitchen! There was plenty of powdered sugar, so additional toppings are purely gratuitous... so I added a bit of maple syrup... and then... AWESOME! After that, I was done... D-U-N-N! \n\nSo, as you can see, I was blown away by the food. Now a quick word on the environs of the joint. The place is decorated with a homely feel. The walls were colored in light beige. And there were also framed posters from what appeared to be the owner's favorite movies. They had one of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and another one of Clint Eastwood's western movies, and other assorted prints.  However, like most breakfast/brunch joints in the city, they're small, so no reservations, just long lines.

We took the T-Line and in to time we arrived at Just For You.  The wait did not seem long so we wrote our name down for 3 on a yellow pad by the door.

I am moving away soon and really wanted pancakes so figured I'd come full circle and return to the diner I ate at a bunch of times when I first came out here.\n\nFirst off, my how times have changed. Waiting lists to sit at the counter, dogs and crowds, babies and coffee, all hovering on the street outside, the neighborhood has really come onto the radar.\n\nMy breakfast was simple: Corn meal pancakes, a 1 pint mimosa, bacon, and coffee.\n\nLet me just start by saying that the meal was incredible. Somehow it wasn't but somehow it was, the pancakes kept whispering to me.. love us... love us....\n\nI sat at the counter after a long and chilly wait that was sort of my fault. I went next door to reno's to get cash and missed my name being called I guess. But when they came out and called another party, then another, then another till I was still the last guy standing there and my name still at the top of the list I began to wonder. Then when they escorted out a guy who had walked in alone, told him to put his name on the list, and then sat HIM, I asked the person if they had had an opeing for me, and pointed at my name. He looked at the list, seemed surprised to see my sad and lonely name, not scratched out in a sea of black ink and found me a seat. Mostly my fault but it was cold as hell and they were full, but not totally slammed. Something I would hope they checked on once or twice.\n\nI had time to look at the menu while waiting outside and knew what I wanted to order. The aformentioned pancakes, coffee, bacon and mimosa. My order was taken quickly, my food popped up in the window even faster, they were very busy but very on it.\n\nI have to say though that from stopping in a few times their food seems to have a lot of variation to it depending on who was in the kitchen. Sometimes the beignets looked fluffy like pillows, like they do at Brenda's, but sometimes they were darker flater crisps closer to east coast fried dough. I don't know what was going on any of those days, but today everything looked great.\n\nThe coffee was coffee, endless and warm and mixed by me with too much sugar and cream to say much about it. I liked it. It was the energizing hot elixer i needed to help me power through a very late brunchfest.\n\nThe bacon came out looking ironed and crisp and thick, I like something a little more greasy and hot, but it was good. Wafers of salty delight, especially when soaked in some syrup, they did have a tendency to crackle and sometimes melt away. Almost like crackers. It was also a large serving, long, wide, thick pieces, 4 or 5 of them. None of that shrimpy little tails nonsense.\n\nThe mimosa was LARGE and fresh and priced at A.Q. which apparently is eight bucks. It was cool and refreshing, mixed well enough that there were bubbles and the elegant touch of sparkling white wine, but it still kept the bulk and satisfaction of fresh juice. A thick wholeness to a drink spotted with light bubbles. It was refreshing and a stark contrast to my coffee(as it should be), it cleansed. \n\nFinally to the pancakes. They were also unassuming, some thick disk laid in front of me soaked in syrup that was rapidly disappearing. I liked that. Like a sponge the cakes fused with all the syrup I could throw at them. The amazing part was that the tops and bottoms stayed crisp. Like thin wafers, each toasted edge crackled as I cut and bit them, exposing the many celled walls within.\n\nThe insides were like a corn muffin, but so much more. They crumbled dryly, but dont be fooled. Once I had a bite in my mouth there was nothing dry about it at all, steamy and hot it became a sweet soft filling taste of joy, soaked in honied syrups. All at once they were crisp and light, moist and dense, delicious and wonderful. I scraped my plate clean.\n\nAll in all I had a surprisingly great experience and a wonderful meal, everything was unassuming and then wonderfully complex. Which brings me to the one off note, my breakfast after tax and tip was about $25. I spent that much at another place recently but also got eggs and home-fries. Hell, I spent that AT Just for you, and got more. The menu in the window showed prices lower than the ones inside. While I don't feel it wasn't worth it, I do feel that given their location and presentation and the fact that it was still pancakes, bacon and coffee poured out of a vat, or pulled off of a pile and served on plain bulk flatware that it could be a little lighter on the wallet.\n\nhttp://alwaysthefatkid.tumblr.com/", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I usually can, and the beignets looked amazing, but my mom wasn't feelin the donuts, so it just gives me more motivation to head back at a later date.

Located in the Dogpatch district of San Francisco, steps away from Hard Knox Cafe, Just For You is a Southern diner with a San Francisco flair.  Decorations on the walls say it all: 2007 LSU Championship banner and a giant plastic marlin share the space with cool old movie posters and street festival announcements.  Does anyone else think that it's deliciously appropriate that Just For You is located on 22nd Street between Third Street and *Tennessee* St?  \n\n\"Wish that I was on ol' rocky top,\nDown in the Tennessee hills.\nAin't no smoggy smoke on rocky top,\nAin't no telephone bills.\"\n\nBut I digress.\n\nIt's the kind of a place where you show up before 9 am or wait in line for 30 min to an hour.  (while you wait outside, you can help yourself to some coffee, but it hardly helps).  It's the kind of a place where an older couple at the table next to you will strike a conversation with you and your dining companion.

We also shared the buttermilk pancakes, which had a fluffy, yet doughy texture.\n\nBut none of that mattered much.  What I was looking forward to were the grits.  I LOVE grits.  Allow me to quote Just For You menu here: \"What's Grits?  It's that pasty white stuff . . . like you had in prison.\"  Just For You grits were a bit bland for my taste, but with the right amount of salt and pepper, and, perhaps, even butter, I was able to perfect the chef's creation.\n\nIt's no Waffle House--nothing is--but Just For You is as close to a great Southern diner as it gets.

Finally decided to go for brunch one Saturday morning, and I was pleasantly surprised to find the food yummy with a southern feel to it.\n\nWhether you order their granola with fruit and yogurt or their chili scramble over cornbread, you won't leave with an unsatisfied stomach. An added bonus? They serve fluffy beignets sprinkled with confection sugar hot off the oven!\n\nTip: On weekends, get there before 11am if you want to avoid waiting for a table for over 15 minutes. If you come later, expect to wait a long, long time. And because seating's pretty limited, I'd recommend just going here for 2some meals, NOT large groups.

These things - which the other reviews tell me are called beignets - are amazing.  They are some sort of puff pastry with powdered sugar melting on them.  Sort of like a donut, but not, sort of like cream puff crust, but not, sort of like...I don't know. Whatever they are, they are amazing.  They are the best hot.  They were pretty good left over too, but they were fantastic hot.  The more I type about them, the more I want to go over the hill and get more.  They are that good.  If you go here and don't try them then you are stupid.  Seriously.\n\nI will most definitely be back.  \n\nNotes of interest:\n \nThey don't let strollers in the restaurant.

First off, these were the WORST beignets I've had. I can't say that I'm an expert but these tasted bitter, like they were fried in oil that hadn't been changed in a very long time. They barely had any flavor and they were just greasy squares of dough with powered sugar heaped on top. The beignets at Angeline's in Berkeley are way better. Definitely not worth the calories.\n\nNext, my blue cheese scramble arrived and it looked straight up nasty, like barf. There were lots of vegetables and chunks of blue cheese and the serving was tiny - it didn't look like they used 3 eggs to make that scramble to me! The home fries were barely crispy and didn't have much flavor. I eyeballed my friend's benedict and it looked pretty rough around the edges as well. Her orange juice looked like it had been diluted with dishwater... or something. Both of our plates arrived at our table lukewarm. Unacceptable!\n\nLeft $35 poorer and grossed out.

Apparently, beignet quality is determined partly by ambient humidity. When it is raining or drizzling out, the beignets are excellent. If it's sunny, better to skip them.

Looking down from the 20th Street overpass, Dogpatch doesn't appear to be the most inviting of places, even in the daytime.

The sparsely-warehoused area right around Just for You feels like it was created exclusively to be visited on Sunday mornings for walks in the park with your dog. It's almost enough to make me want to go out and GET a dog. But that's not really the point of the review, I guess. \n\nFirst, let me get the obligatory beignets mention out of the way. The beignets are great. Get some no matter what else you order. As a main breakfast dish, get the pancakes; their cornmeal or oatmeal pancakes are some of the best I've had. In my experience restaurant pancakes are usually either \"okay\" or \"terrible,\" so this makes them that much better.\n\nThe scrambles and the Mexican breakfast dishes are hit-or-miss. I've had them when they are pretty good and the flavors work very well together, and other times when they come out surprisingly bland. They're never awful, but the pancakes are a better deal and more reliable.\n\nEven if the food was terrible, though, I would probably still go here for the ambience. It is always busy, but they're careful with their limited seating, so it's never quite as cramped as you're afraid it will be. The ever-changing neon posters and amusingly caustic signs plastered over the walls should be too jarring for a relaxing breakfast, but it really defines the place's visual style. A thousand times better than the pallid beach-with-seagulls-and-reeds scenes you usually wind up with at breakfast-y restaurants.

With so many brunch places in the city, I wondered how this diner was surviving. \n\nDriving up to the eatery, my first impression was that this place was a hipster hangout. A line of \"just rolled out of bed, i don't give a shit but I somewhat do with these Ray Bans, skinnys and flannel scarf\" patrons were waiting in line to get their breakfast on. Stepping into the diner however, I noticed how the cozy tones and funky posters combined with the aromas of powdered sugar and cinnamon made this spot instantaneously amicable. I ordered a Beignet to share with a friend. It was huge, warm, fluffy and extremely delicious. I could of eaten two of these, drank my coffee and been in state of complete bliss. I did however, want to try more items. I went with a grilled catfish fillet, scrambled eggs, grits and cornbread combo. Talk about a lot of food!  I liked that the catfish was prepared grilled instead of fried. My love hate relationship with carbs also fully appreciated and then fretted over the extensive bread options (cornbread, cinnamon raisin, scone, english muffin, toast, wheat) and choice of grits or homefries (I chose grits). The bread here is homemade. The quality of the classic diner fare was not sacrificed with quantity. Prices are also very reasonable with most menu items under $10. This place beats Serpentine (aka what's up with the communal table between two restrooms) across the street in my book. \n\nOne or two cons about this place: Coffee contributes extensively to my ability to enjoy breakfast. I wish they served better coffee here. Also, this place takes only cash or check. A friend was visiting me from NYC....you can figure out the rest. Anyway, these aren't reasons enough to deter continuous visits. I'll be back for the creole crab cakes, the bread and the beignets.

I went for the Cowboy (2 eggs, French toast, and sausage/bacon). I was very excited to see that they offered a Filipino sausage called longanisa (yum!) which they allowed me to substitute for the Cowboy sausage. Overall, the food was great.
