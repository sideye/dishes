I've been in there enough for one or two of the workers to recognize me.\n\nSince I find myself getting my coffee fix here, what I like to say how strong and delicious the daily variety of brewed coffees and as well as my soy lattes. Sometimes I feel like having a cup of hot tea. In that case, there are many varieties of tea bags to choose from. Pastries and bagels are definitely fresh and super yummy from Semifreddi's and House of Bagels.They either sell them at a discounted price ($1/pastry) towards the end of the day or give them out to homeless (that was what I was told).\n\nWhat I am always amaze is how they manage to remember the drinks the customers order especially when there are 3 to 4 cups lined up to be filled. Either way, they've only messed up my drinks about twice since I did not clarify whether I wanted a mocha or a latte. But so far, no mistakes! Just recently as a suggestion from a previous yelper, I decided to try a caramel soy latte and let me tell you this: \n\n\"OMG...so smooth with the right amount of caramel. Why does Starbucks' taste like fake sugar and crap\" (By the way, I do not dislike SB for some things)\n\nAnyway, small coffee shop with a neighborhood feel.

You could buy prepackaged bagels, sandwiches, cartons of milk, cookies, etc.\n\nThe food was horrible. It was the beanery or the cafeteria - and the cafeteria was worse than prison food.\n\nThe beanery was disgusto. Dirrrty like when Xtina Aguilera did her music video. High school kids went there, pushed each other around - they'd make fun of the special ed kids. Some couples would be making out in the corner and doing godknowswhat.  Some kids genuinely wanted to get some food and would have their money in hand - only to have some gangster wannabe snatch it out of their hands and bolt out of the beanery.  It was chaotic.  It was sad. Yes, I am one of the many deformed and dysfunctional products of a public school system. \n\nSo when I saw the Beanery on Irving this past Saturday, my heart skipped several beats. Memories of the beanery in high school started to flood my mind. I did not want to go in. However, I really needed that coffee and I knew Starbucks was not going to do it. (Note: I am proud to say that  I am no longer drinking Starbucks. I have not walked into a Starbucks since.. last month).\n\nThe Beanery on Irving was chill - there were a number of single dudes hangin' out each occupying their own table - preying on any hot girl customers while pretending to read the SF Chronicle, which has gone to nothing now, but still, they were making an effort to look well-read. \n\nThe staff was friendly. I tried to use my Spanish and they laughed and talked to me in English. I ordered a single latte ($2.60) which came out strong. Just the way I like it. I will definitely come back here again. It was nothing like the beanery in high school. There was no making out, no stealing money, none of that.
