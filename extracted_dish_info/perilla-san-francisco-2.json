From the outside it doesn't look great and judging by the choice of condiments and chopsticks on the table one would assume that they were Chinese rather than Vietnamese or at most Chinese Viets. Anyway going in we were met with a very friendly waiter who actually gave us top notch service throughout our stay. The menu is simple and easy to navigate with nothing too complicated. My advise is the Pho. Anything else is not compulsory. The broth is sweet and quite light, not heavy and thick like some places; It has been filtered quite a bit it seems. Second is the choice of topping. I ordered the Perilla Beef Combo Pho which includes meat balls, beef brisket and rare beef. The meat balls are lovely, and have a great texture to them: what you really look for in a properly made meat ball - not process and filled with fillers. The brisket was passable in my opinion and didn't really stand out. However the rare beef was as it should be - rare.

Oftentimes we're let down by over cooked noodles that have been soaking in a pot for hours. Not here!\n\nThe other thing to mention is their five spices chicken. It's grilled, tastes great, smells even better and looks the real deal. Most importantly for me is that they use thigh meat (dark) rather than dry breast meat (white). I feel that they have put good attention to many of their dishes and thus have differentiated themselves from the average money busting rip off Vietnamese Pho joint. Too add to the food - the service was 10/10. Couldn't have asked for a better server. He was keen, had an eye for detail and explained the dishes well. (Well done you!). The total bill came to $31 for three of us which is very decent indeed especially when it's both yummy and filling. We couldn't finish it all so had to get a take out box. That's what you call bargain. \n\nWould I go there again? Hell yea! Go with friends and family, partners, bros, girls the lot.

For about $10, depending on what you get, you get huge portions that can feed a SUPER hungry person or two people with a medium to appetite. I wish they were a little closer (SF is a trek for me and this is deep in SF with no shortcuts to get to and fro) because I really like their food. They're also SO NICE! On the phone and in person, they're so caring and hospitable. I usually tip anyway when I pick up food but I WANTED to tip a little extra than what I usually do. My picky SO enjoyed the veggie garlic noodles. I really appreciate that with their plates, they give broccoli on the side. I love broccoli and it's not overcooked. They even season it a little bit with something, I think or perhaps it's the aromas and condensation permeating into the green flesh, soaking up the garlic goodness.

Like I said, good portions. I adore and salivate for imperial rolls like these that use rice paper instead of the flour but only if it's done right and they do it right. The pork and veggie inside the rolls are delicious and the dipping sauce, which is good too but to me, not needed. I just pop them into my mouth and it's gone. lol #30 and #51 each had 6 pieces of the deep fried rolls with a healthy (\"healthy\" how are butter infused noodles \"healthy\"? lol I don't care! Gimme!) amount of delicious garlic noodles. Oh and some broccoli. Who says I'm not healthy? ;) \n\n#59 was pretty good but if I had meat options at a place like this, I'm ordering the meat. It's good though and I also liked the Curry chicken soup which had a good spicy kick to it but not overpowering for baby spice buds like my tongue that can't handle much. The food tastes even better and more flavorful the following days as leftovers. Everything really infuses into each morsel. Next time, I'd order #27 Imperial rolls & Five spice chicken garlic noodles $10.75\n\nOnly thing is, I wish they offered and had brown rice but that can be because of limited space in kitchen or something. Well, if someone knows the manager/owner of Perilla and can suggest this and make this happen, you can be my friend lol, I'd totally pay extra for this healthier (low sugar spike and more fiber BUT it does have more arsenic...meh give me brown rice please! nom nom I don't care... yum in my tum lol)\n\nI also like the feel of this location better than the one in the financial district.

We started off with the papaya salad with charbroiled beef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=zw0FDaMoxoSw2gnDUJVf4g). Man, the portion was huge! It came with freshly julienned papaya, basil, carrots, peanuts, dried shallots, and a ton of charbroiled beef. The flavors of the charbroiled beef and veggies complemented with the fish sauce DELICIOUSLY. Next time, I'd probably prefer the papaya salad with poached shrimp instead...the beef was a little too heavy as a starter for me. We then ordered 2 orders of imperial rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=iWz-T5a2bmd2ferjrGJL2w) and five spice chicken garlic noodle and 1 order of charbroiled pork rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RNy3_hU1N2qyS5PVc9RaYQ?select=jyWQX5GrkY16ZcNdNvyLzg).

On the phone and in person, they're so caring and hospitable. I usually tip anyway when I pick up food but I WANTED to tip a little extra than what I usually do. My picky SO enjoyed the veggie garlic noodles. I really appreciate that with their plates, they give broccoli on the side. I love broccoli and it's not overcooked. They even season it a little bit with something, I think or perhaps it's the aromas and condensation permeating into the green flesh, soaking up the garlic goodness.

Like I said, good portions. I adore and salivate for imperial rolls like these that use rice paper instead of the flour but only if it's done right and they do it right. The pork and veggie inside the rolls are delicious and the dipping sauce, which is good too but to me, not needed. I just pop them into my mouth and it's gone. lol #30 and #51 each had 6 pieces of the deep fried rolls with a healthy (\"healthy\" how are butter infused noodles \"healthy\"? lol I don't care! Gimme!) amount of delicious garlic noodles. Oh and some broccoli. Who says I'm not healthy? ;) \n\n#59 was pretty good but if I had meat options at a place like this, I'm ordering the meat. It's good though and I also liked the Curry chicken soup which had a good spicy kick to it but not overpowering for baby spice buds like my tongue that can't handle much. The food tastes even better and more flavorful the following days as leftovers. Everything really infuses into each morsel. Next time, I'd order #27 Imperial rolls & Five spice chicken garlic noodles $10.75\n\nOnly thing is, I wish they offered and had brown rice but that can be because of limited space in kitchen or something. Well, if someone knows the manager/owner of Perilla and can suggest this and make this happen, you can be my friend lol, I'd totally pay extra for this healthier (low sugar spike and more fiber BUT it does have more arsenic...meh give me brown rice please! nom nom I don't care... yum in my tum lol)\n\nI also like the feel of this location better than the one in the financial district.

Other than the noodles, the entree included: a generous amount of the pork, two pieces of broccoli, and a nice dipping sauce (sweet and sourish fish sauce?) on the side. The portions are pretty big so I usually ask them for a box and even when I reheat it later on, it's still delicious! Thinking about this dish is making me have some serious withdrawals.

The broth was bland and the soup wasn't even hot enough to cook the raw beef!  HUH? I had the garlic noodles with imperial rolls (egg rolls) and beef.  It was alright not good enough to make me come back.  I also ordered a Thai iced tea that tasted deluded.  That is a complete \"no-no\".

And his effect is contagious, indeed. \n\nUpon walking in, the owner would welcome you as if you were his very own son/daughter -- and that is how I felt like, son/daughter. He makes no distinction between gender, age, nor race. To him, all that enters are hungry, and all will be treated as hungry.\n\nUnlike the standardized conversation of how many restaurants follow, the owner is special in that he not only would ask how your day was, but would push a conversation making you feel that this is an interaction between two human beings, and not just two strangers -- albeit you had just met. He wears a grand smile on his face, and in effect you would have no choice but to be emotionally vulnerable throughout your whole time in the restaurant. I didn't feel like I was entering a business, instead I was entering my home after a long absence. I wanted to cry.\n\nI ordered the garlic noodle, grilled pork, and imperial rolls.

Maybe because Jamie W. and I are used to the one on Mission near the demolished Transbay Terminal, a bustling place during the lunch hour, that we were marginally disappointed with the garlic level in the garlic noodles served here. Dare I say it was a tad bland, which makes stuffing your face with heavy-duty carbs more of a dietary challenge than it has to be. But I won't ding them much for that since the quality level is still pretty darn high for the Perilla brand.\n\nNow that there are three of them in the city plus PPQ Beef Noodle House close to this location and the PPQ Dungeness Island in the Outer Richmond - are we looking at the Vietnamese version of the King of Thai Noodle chain? Could be... In truth, we went to the Geary location first but found it closed for renovation, so out of determination to have our garlic noodles, we took the 44 O'Shaughnessy line to the Irving Street location, which was very nearly packed. Soon after we were seated, we ordered the $6.50 Shrimp Rolls, which were a tad small but still delectable as a starter.\n\nJamie and I went our separate ways on our $8.50 Garlic Noodle plates - I had my standby, the Five-Spice Chicken (see photo), while he veered into the Charbroiled Pork marinaded in garlic and pepper (see photo). Both were perfectly tasty, but I have to admit the standout may have been the $6.50 plate of Seasoned Vegetables - shredded cabbage and carrots mixed with fried tofu (see photo).

I actually think this location is better.  For the FiDi lunch rush, that location must precook a lot of the garlic noodles; I've seen huge the huge vats they pull from.  We came here for an early dinner when it wasn't that crowded; our order took awhile so I figured they made it fresh.  And I could tell the difference; the noodles were so good!\n\nImperial Rolls and Charbroiled Beef Garlic Noodle: I love this dish because I get three of my favorite things and only two pieces of steamed broccoli (which is still too much broccoli).  The imperial rolls were perfectly crispy and filled with moist pork.  It's not Tu Lan quality, but still really good.  I love the charbroiled beef because it's shellacked with tangy marinade and full of seared goodness; almost like having Korean BBQ done for you.  The garlic noodles are so garlicky and chewy.  They're not quite as good as An The Go (i.e. Crustacean's food truck), but still yummy. \n\nPork Chop Garlic Noodle: A massive amount of meat.  Thinly cut, heavily marinated and nicely seared like the beef.  As much as I'm a big fan of the beef, this may be better.\n\nCup of Broth: I know you don't come here for the pho, so I obviously didn't order pho.  But I was curious how it tasted so I got a cup of their beef pho broth.  It was basically meh.  Heavy tones of star anise and salt.
