There's bar seating and just a few small tables for two. It doesn't seem to get too crowded so if you gave up waiting for Plow, it's a good option. \n\nBrunch is served until 3 PM. For the most part, they have tartines using sourdough bread from Jane Bakery. I was a bit sad to find there were not a lot of GF friendly options so we opted for the Quinoa Bowl & smoothies.\n\nQuinoa Bowl ($9) Kale, mushroom, onion, turkey bacon, feta, red pepper flakes, poached egg. Honestly tasted extremely basic and plain. Most of the bowl was just quinoa and I was hoping for more of the other listed ingredients. The bacon was not that great and came in tiny little slices too. The egg was poached nicely but that was about it. Super overpriced and don't recommend getting!\n\nAlmond Butter Tartine ($6) - Honey, cinnamon, fresh fruit, chia seeds. Tasted good but not great.\n\nGreen Butter Smoothie ($10) - Almond milk, spinach, banana, vanilla, almond butter, maca, maple syrup. This was the only thing I liked here, it tasted great! I got it without the maple syrup since I thought that would make it too sweet and felt like that was a pretty good decision. Its a pretty steep price for a smoothie that doesn't even have protein in it though...\n\nPitaya Smoothie ($8) - Pitaya, banana, strawberry, raspberry, coconut water. Tasted super tart and really didn't like this drink. Do not get.\n\nOverall I had a really mediocre experience here, and I probably won't be back unless I swipe on a free Tinder brunch.
