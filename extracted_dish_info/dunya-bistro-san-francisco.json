We ordered hummus to start and each had our own entrees. \n\nHummus ($6) was bland but creamy-I love hummus so I ate it, anyway. Overall, it was a forgettable dish.\nChicken Shish Kebab ($12)- my kebab was not fully cooked. When I told my waiter in a discrete and polite way to not scare neighboring tables, he simply glanced at it and walked away. Perhaps he was too ashamed to apologize? Who knows. He did come back to tell me two more minutes but did not acknowledge the pinky texture of my meat. \nIt came back with the missing chunk that was pink, super greasy, yet still not flavorful. Hmmmm if I'm going to eat something so oily, I'd expect some delicious goodness at the least but this was far off.  I wish this tasted better since it looked so good on the plate. My order also came with a side of grilled/greasy veggies- I DID like the veggies though- they were extremely flavorful. \nSparkling Rose ($36/bottle)- We opted for this since not everyone in our party likes reds. Nothing spectacular- I'd recommend not ordering this either.\n\nWe opted to not risk it with dessert since the dishes were all mediocre. Overall, the restaurant has a nice decor and homey vibe. I just wish my chicken was fully-cooked and more tasty.

We then shared a few of the vegetarian apps to start: Kabak Ezme, Crispy Falafels, and Sigara Boregi; a plate of pita triangles came on the side.\nThe Kabak Ezme was a kind of pureed zucchini-yogurt dip, flavored with mint, dill, and garlic. The dip was thick like Labneh, with a great yogurt tang and a subtle hint of garlic. The falafels were nicely crispy and just the right size - I am so tired of baseball-sized falafels. The accompanying tahini was very creamy and flavorful. The Sigara Boregi were just what they sound like - little \"cigars\" of feta and parsley wrapped in phyllo and then fried. These were actually my least favorite of the apps, just seemed a little bland compared to the others. There didn't seem to be much parsley *or* feta flavor. I even dipped them in first the tahini then the Kabak, but that didn't add any flavor either. They might have needed a little longer in the fryer as well, the phyllo wasn't that crisp. \nFor our main courses, we opted for the prawn shish kebab and the beyti. The shish kebab was served as 2 skewers and was definitely enough for 2 people to share. It was a nice presentation of prawns threaded with lemon slices. The prawns were well-cooked and lemony and apparently marinated in \"exotic spices\". The beyti was a dish not familiar to me, but it was delicious. Thin lavash bread was wrapped around oblong patties of finely ground beef and lamb. The meat was well-seasoned and spiced. A rather uninteresting tomato sauce surrounded the individual \"wraps\", while some more tangy yogurt and some unremarkable veggies came on the side. We had filled up so much on the apps that we had to take some beyti home with us and didn't have room for dessert. The beyti tasted very good for breakfast yesterday :-)\nMinus a star for not having the Turkish national dish of Manti (!) and another for the seating issue at the beginning. I wish a couple dishes were more cohesive as well. There is another coupon today through SF Weekly though, so I will probably buy that and return to try the lamb burger and the piyaz based on their yum reviews.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-07-11"}, {"excerpts": ["the food was so good, definitely recommend the beyti."], "author": "Glynis M.", "review": "the food was so good, definitely recommend the beyti.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-04-04"}, {"excerpts": ["My wife ordered and raved about the stuffed falafel sald, and I had the beyti.
