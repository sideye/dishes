My Mango Lassi is freshly prepared and tastey, though I would like it colder (it was room temp).  The only thing I didn't like was my dessert, Gulab Jamun. It was wayyyy too sweet for my taste.  \n\nService - our waiter was very nice, knowledgable, and very accomondating.  The other servers were super nice too. Our water's always filled, never less than half the glass.  Only down side is that when I asked to see how naan is prepared (as suggested in their menu), i couldn't b/c the kitchen was too busy.  I would've love to see that.\n\nDecor etc - the high ceilings made us feel really comfortable and not crowded, even tho there were a lot of tables. Usually at indian places, i feel so cramped in.

The naan was very soft & tastes like they prepared it fresh (still really hot!) and made in the tandoor like it's supposed to.  I usually don't like basmati rice b/c it's too hard, but it was tastey here.  The Kashmiri Delight tastes great, very frizzy, good lime flavor, refreshing.  My Mango Lassi is freshly prepared and tastey, though I would like it colder (it was room temp).  The only thing I didn't like was my dessert, Gulab Jamun. It was wayyyy too sweet for my taste.  \n\nService - our waiter was very nice, knowledgable, and very accomondating.  The other servers were super nice too. Our water's always filled, never less than half the glass.  Only down side is that when I asked to see how naan is prepared (as suggested in their menu), i couldn't b/c the kitchen was too busy.  I would've love to see that.\n\nDecor etc - the high ceilings made us feel really comfortable and not crowded, even tho there were a lot of tables. Usually at indian places, i feel so cramped in.  Not here.  The whole place looks very professional and clean.  The peacock copper dishes set on the tables were reallllllly pretty.  Sadly, we don't use them.  Our waiter collected it away.  I wonder what they're used for.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-03-13"}], "nimbu pani": [{"excerpts": ["DRINKS:\n- Nimbu pani, sweet lassi, mango lassi & chai; all good but the 'nimbu pani' was my fav!\n"], "author": "Anjali V.", "review": "Ambiance:\nClassic, traditional & authentic - loved the vibe as I can't think of any other place in SF that goes \"all out\" in this respect anymore!\n\nLocation:\nIn the heart of touristy-SF/Union Square, and parking is a logistical nightmare for any place this close to downtown, so it truly is a blessing that this spot's beyond easily BART/MUNI accessible by Powell - either take public transit, walk, or grab a Lyft/Sidecar/Uber.\n\nReservations:\nAvailable through OpenTable - just make sure there isn't a conference/convention in town nearby as that will inevitably effect the service, out of no fault of the restaurant/mgmt itself.\n\nFood (2 people shared and we had plenty of leftovers)\nDRINKS:\n- Nimbu pani, sweet lassi, mango lassi & chai; all good but the 'nimbu pani' was my fav!\nAPPS:\n- Chlli cheese pakoras; easily shareable, cooked perfectly crispy outside and not at all saturated in oil as most pakoras can be\nMAIN:\n- Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Masala & Sag Paneer; all so very flavorful, well-portioned, and not overwhelmingly spicy (which is great for me as my taste buds deceive my ethnicity)\n- Plain naan & rice; great & nothing was overly dried out as happens often at other places\n\nPricing:\nThis is fine-dining Indian food, so, nope, it's not cheap.

It was the perfect spot for the six of us who had come - we were able to enjoy great conversation while sipping drinks from the bar. In addition to fun creative cocktails like the Madras Madness rum, mango and grenadine drink I had, they serve non alcohol drinks like mango lassis (sweet or salty) and nimbu pani.\n\nFor appetizers:\n- Vegetable pakoras (fried vegetables, these are my absolute favorite)\n- Mini vegetable samosas (a smaller version of the larger samosas, these little treats had a kick. Careful, they're hot!)\n- Hariyali tikka (chicken with a spice. Yum.)\n\nDinner was excellent, we ordered: \n- Regular naan (savory, just the right texture of chewy)\n- Rogan josh (spiced tomato based curry with lamb, with a kick)\n- Saag paneer (on the sweet side, but still amazing with a generous amount of paneer chunks)\n\nThe food is delicious - wonderful flavors, always made to the spice level as requested. The ambiance inside is regal - tall ceilings, fancy decor - it feels like being in an Indian palace.\n\nEvery time I come, I feel nourished and relaxed. It's one of the places I'm happy to say that I'm a regular.\n\nAdditionally, I've gotten to know the owner Ranjan - in addition to the restaurant, he does amazing things with his culinary expertise, like the trip he is planning with patrons eager to taste more of India - with a trip there.\n\nHe also started the Compassionate Chefs Cafe, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising money to help children \"locally and globally.\" How many restaurant owners do you know who also have non-profits??

Their samosas are not overcoked and not too greasy and you can't believe how fast they disappear from your appetizer plate. Their saag is some of the best I have ever had and their chicken and lamb dishes are SOOOOOOO tender making it extra easy to take on this meal with your hands which is how real indian dining happens. For $27 you can get a whole indian feast brought to your table with tandoori chicken which actually has spice!!! (imagine that, a spicy indian dish with actual spice in it!! I didn't really need any chutney for that dish!) and seekh kabobs. And their naan is actually less than $2!!! It always angers me when indian places try charging $3 and $4 for one naan when it is really just bread and your utensil for eating!!! \n\nSo props to them for their fresh well priced naan and all the rest of the fixings!!!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-04-20"}]}
