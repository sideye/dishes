However, after digging into it, we realized that there was hardly any meat/shrimp in it. The filling consisted mostly of bean sprout.. meat to bean sprout ratio was like 1:100 practically. I understand that this is not home, and you can't stuff your banh xeo to the brim in the interest of making money, but at least ground up some pork and spread it out or something... the fish sauce was too sweet for our tastes.\n\nSpring Rolls: Decent size, only came with shrimp. I'm used to having both the sliced pork belly AND shrimp in my spring rolls. You're already slicing the shrimp in half, throw in some pork belly slices! (Although, we may have accidentally ordered spring rolls that only came with shrimp? Not sure.)\n\nBanh Canh Cua: The soup had a weird consistency, and was very bland. Not much to say about this dish.\n\nBun Bo Hue: When this came out first, we all thought, \"Ooooh\". It looked very promising. Deep red soup base with tons of spices, 3 slices of the cha lua (pork cake), couple cubes of pork blood, and some pork meat. The broth ended up being really bland, despite the red coloring and abundance of spices floating around. The pork, however, was really tender, and you could tell they slow cooked it in the bland broth.\n\nGrilled Pork Vermicelli: I didn't personally get a taste of this, but according to my sister, it was decent. Pork had good smokey flavor and was tender. The only thing is that the fish sauce they make here is a little too sweet for our tastes, so that negatively affects the other dishes that include fish sauce.\n\nBanh Beo with Cha Lua: Decent. Not much to say about it...\n\nOverall: The bill for these 6 dishes came out to be $47.xx, which isn't that bad.

It is tastier than the vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown but can not compare with San Jose. \n\nOn this day, I did not go with the individual dishes (i.e. pho / rice plate / etc.) Instead, I ordered family style entrees (shrimp papaya salad, grilled shrimp and grilled clams) to share. The grilled shrimp was good. The shrimp papaya salad was decent. The grilled clams was average.
