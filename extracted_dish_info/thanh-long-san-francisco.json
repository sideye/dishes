She asked me if I wanted to take a one day trip to San Francisco.  \"Heck yea!\", I told her.  I haven't been to SF in years.  Now, I had my heart set on going to House of Prime Rib but they were booked a month in advance.  But, I had remembered seeing Thanh Long featured on either the Travel or Food Channel weeks beforehand so I tried booking a reservation online.  Sadly, there was nothing available so I called the restaurant and got a reservation!\n\nI viewed the menu online and browsed through the photos on Yelp beforehand.  I knew I wanted to order the Thanh Long Mussels and An's Famous Garlic Noodles.  I was up in the air on the Dungeness Crab because I knew it would be rather pricey.\n\nWe arrived at 5:30 that night and was promptly seated to our table.  We looked around and noticed that every table was having the crab so we asked our server what the market price was ($53.95 as of October 8th).  We figured we would not be back to SF for awhile so we ended up ordering Tempura Style Coconut Prawns, Thanh Long Mussels, the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles.  The Prawns were ok.  Nothing that blew me away.  The Mussels; however,  were delicious.  I would definitely order that again for an appetizer.  The Roast Crab...O M G!  That was the BEST crab I have ever had!  I'm not really too sure what all the spices they use but it was heaven.  The crab meat was so tender and flavorful.  And the Garlic Noodles may not look like much when it arrives to your table, but once you take a bite you will not be able to stop slurping those noodles.  Mix it with the sauce from the crab and it tastes even better!  \n\nThe service here is top notch!  They kept checking back with us to see how everything was and constantly refilled our drinks (soda and iced tea).  I would definitely recommend and come back here for dinner.

", "There were 5 and were good "], "author": "Glenn H.", "review": "4.5 stars. Minus a half a star for the value of some of the items but overall a terrific night out.\n\nThis is a prize of a place. Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order. The prawns did have a tendency to stick to their shells, but they were perfectly done and marinated in some fantastic sauce to make them outstanding.\n\nThe Garlic noodles had the perfect consistency of Yee Noodles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_mein, which gives them an extra nice bite and appear to absorb the flavors better. They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["That's how I felt because I wanted to venture out and try their TEMPURA STYLE COCONUT PRAWNS.

We drove towards the setting sun, passing many other good lookin' eateries, promised a crab coma experience...\n\nWe entered a simple door. The garlic pervaded everything. It was the kind that made you hungry, newly fried garlic that makes your mouth water. All around, people sat with plastic bibs! The group of diners to my left were happily passing around the famous noodles. The couple in front of me finished ordering and started to tie back their hair. An odd thing to do, but soon I'd fully understand.\n\nI glanced down at the menu and inhaled the garlic permeating the air, agreeing it was worth the trip from downtown to the other side to eat at Thanh Long. My hometown, Nha Trang, was even labeled on the menu cover. :-) Then, the waiters tied a bib on me and walked away with a knowing look. We started with the salmon carpaccio and the shrimp toast. The salmon was sliced thinly enough to hold full flavor and the citrus hit was perfect. The shrimp toast was pillow goodness. The topping reminded me of the shrimp paste around sugar cane.\n\nThen the garlic noodles! So good! Best when eaten hot, so get it on your plate then into your belly fast. The noodles were a nice chewy texture and a subtle garlic flavor that was nothing as powerful as its garlic aroma. Then again, you're hit with garlic the moment you walk in.\n\nThen...THE CRAB! Some of the best Dungeoness crab I've ever eaten. My table ordered the roasted crab and tamarind crab. Very different. Very satisfying. I paused for a split second to be thankful all my hair was already tied up. No one at my table ate their crab carapaces, so this Vietnamese gal was in heaven with five all to herself! Then, we went garlic crazy and ordered garlic fried rice. The tamarind crab went great with it.\n\nAfter all this, I had a disappointing fried banana. Others had the orange sherbet and the molten lava cake and enjoyed their desserts. My fried banana had no hint of a sugar finish...brown, white, nor palm.

For $38 dollars, you get one crab in a variety of styles.  The best here is the roasted crab.  It is delightfully buttery and peppery.  The sauce is so good, it inspired my sister to toss her entire bowl of rice into what was essentially a whole lot of crab flavored butter.  Calories be damned.  So, this dish was good.\n\nI was less impressed by the drunken crab.  It was a little on the bland side.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, but the broth was kind of dull and watery.  It could have used a lot more flavor.  The crab was fresh, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nWe also got the shaken beef, which is beef marinaded in a sweet, salty sauce served with vegetables.  It was very tender.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The vegetables complimented the meat very well.  But, the fried potatoes were a bit weird.  I would get this dish again.\n\nThe other good thing here is the garlic noodles.  FYI, it tastes like it has some fish sauce or oyster sauce or crab broth in it.  So, if you are vegetarian beware.  The presentation is really poor.  They come out looking like very ordinary tan noodles.  But, the flavor is salty and sweet with a nice garlic flavor.  It is a bit more on the sweeter side than I expected.  But, it was very good.\n\nWe also had the boulliabaisse, the salmon carpaccio, the soft shell crabs, the mixed seasonal vegetables and the sea bass.  The soft shell crabs are a definite miss.  They lacked seasoning.  The batter was not that crispy.  It was a below average dish.\n\nThe boulliabaisse was a nice fish broth with vegetables floating in it and some rock shrimp that were cooked well.  It was ok.  Just think Tom Yum soup.  Nothing really special.\n\nThe salmon carpaccio was tasty.  The shallots added a nice contrast to the sweet salmon.  But, the portion was very small.\n\nThe mixed seasonal vegetables were well cooked, but ultimately they were just roasted vegetables.  Nothing special.\n\nFinally, the sea bass was a little overcooked.  The sauce was nice and mild.  It was ok.  But, nothing special.  It came with some vegetables in a light sauce.  \n\nI also had a mixed drink.  It was a bit on the sweet side.  FYI, the food here is not spicy, so fruity drinks do not pair well.  It is better to go with one of the dry white wines.  For a Vietnamese place, they don't use a lot of sour flavors, so the dry wine brings a little acidity to the food and makes the flavors come out.\n\nThe dessert menu was not very exciting.  Deep fried banana, chocolate molten cake.  All the standard stuff.  Nothing unusual or complicated.  We skipped it.\n\nThe service was typical for an Asian restaurant.  Not very attentive.  But, everyone was well dressed.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and surprisingly modern inside.  Outside, it looks like a dumpy Chinese restaurant in the Sunset.  But, there are some nice silks and figurines decorating the interior of the restaurant.  This is a good place for a special occasion meal or for a date although the clientele is a bit on the older side (mid to late 40s).  So, it is not exactly hip.

The room is fragrant with garlic and spices. This is the real deal, I say to my parents.\n\nWe order the salmon carpaccio and Thanh Long mussels as starter dishes. Capers give the fresh salmon a nice, salty hint. The mussels practically melt in your mouth. Mop up the remaining juices with your bread. Perfection.\n\nGarlic noodles are delicious, but they're nothing special without the crab. Isn't that why you came in the first place? So we order one roast crab. By itself the crab is meaty and fragrant, but the sauce is the extra level. It's like instant gratification when you drizzle that over the noodles.\n\nThe flavor's slightly more subtle in comparison to Boiling Crab, of course---especially if you love the whole sha-bang---but that's where the sophistication lies. That, and the customer service makes Thanh Long worth the price and visit.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-02-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I've tried the salmon carpaccio, lemongrass chicken satay, and mango salad.

The flavor of butter and cracked pepper just explodes in your mouth.  I'm a big eater so I always have to have my own crab and another entr\u00e9e.  Stick to the roasted crab instead of the tamarind crab.  The sauce on the tamarind crab is a little sweet for my taste buds.  The Thanh Long spicy eggplant is good, but nowhere near spicy.  As for dessert, don't get the bread pudding.  The orange sorbet was good and the presentation was clever.  It's a frozen orange sliced across the top with orange sorbet inside.  It's nice, light, and a good ending to any meal.  \n\nAt about $40 per crab, it's not cheap.

I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know why they won't sit full parties - it puts their entire reservation schedule off track - if two people of a seven party table is late, it extends their duration at the table once the two LATE people do get there, and causes the table who will be using that table next a delay, and so forth throughout the evening. \n\n30 minutes after our reservation time, my late sibling and her guest arrived, I kindly let the hostess know that we were finally all there, she told me that the only table available that sits 7 is currently paying and as soon as they leave, she'd be able to sit us - this was \"the best that she could do at this time.\" - I thanked her nicely and proceeded to apologize for my mom's reaction and that I understand why they couldn't seat us. \n\n5 minutes later - she came to me and said that she had another table available and we could be seated right away.

The treatment that we got was eat and get out. maybe because we were such a big group? They told us that we had a 2 hours. (Time limit) Never heard of that for a restaurant. I thought that was rude. The waitress was looking at us and giving us the evil to hurry up and leave. Which was not nice. \nOtherwise the food is Good, not great. \nThe Grilled Calamari was good but salty which I hate salty foods. My sister had the steamed Sea Bass. it was OK.

At least the meat was fresh though.\n\n#Garlic Noodles: B-.\nThis was the biggest disappointment of the night. I was very looking forward to that as I heard so many good things about this dish from this place.... but there was like almost zero garlic taste..... like 1% and I'm not even exaggerating. It did taste okay, the noodle was springy, it just shouldn't be called \"garlic\" noodle though.\n\nWe also got a banana foster as dessert at the end and it was alight.

"], "author": "Violet N.", "review": "I've been going to Thanh Long for as long as I can remember. Over 5 years for sure and because of my frequent visits, majority of the staff knows my name and most of them know exactly what I'd usually order... scary I know, but I love it.\n\nI'm giving Thanh Long 5 stars because I feel that the overall experience is great. With a casual atmosphere, cozy modern Asian decor, a wide variety of French/Vietnamese inspired dishes and an amazing friendly staff, it is always a joy to come here. \n\nMust Haves: \n1. Appetizers - Thanh Long Mussels\n2. Entree: Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles. \n    (Large enough portion for two)\n3. Dessert: Vanilla Creme Brulee\n\nPros: This place might look small, but it can seat a ton of people so if you are looking for a great place to host your birthday dinner or celebration dinner, they can accommodate you. Make sure you make reservations at least a month ahead of time.\n\nCons: Parking is horrible, but that's because everyone wants to eat here. To save yourself from wanting to hit every car that is already parked with the bat that is in your trunk because you're annoyed from circling around for the 500th time... Park valet. Make sure you tip the valet guys good because these guys are outside in the cold, for who knows how long, to park your car while you're inside the warm restaurant ready to eat some amazing crab. Another con would probably be that the bar area is extremely small and since it's pretty much combined with the waiting area, being as crowded as it is, you'll feel like you're in a packed dance club trying to get a drink.  Better to wait outside.\n\nAdvice: Make sure you have a reservation, especially during weekends and holidays. It's just for convenience because you don't want to go to the restaurant with a group of people or a date after it took you about an hour or so to find parking and then find out that you would have to wait another hour and half before you get sat. Walk-ins do exist and if you do decide to go that route, you'll probably be waiting around for quite awhile drooling as you watch other people enjoy their meal.\n\nMajor Advice: If you don't like getting your hands dirty, you'd probably want to skip this restaurant. This place is known for their roasted crab and with that being said people... you eat crab with your freaking hands!! So for you dainty girls who are scared to get dirty... this place isn't for you! Eating the crab here is the whole fun experience because you can be in a nice restaurant and still be able to get down and dirty without feeling embarrassed. If you decide to come to this restaurant to dine on anything else but the crab... than you should just choose another freaking restaurant. By you doing that, it's like you deciding to go to a burger joint to order a salad... What the heck!? Don't get me wrong, all of their other dishes are great, but you have to at least order the crab... any crab. If you've already tasted the crab and came back to try the other dishes... please do so because they're just as delicious.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-02-18"}], "salt and pepper calamari": [{"excerpts": ["I absolutely love their fried salt and pepper calamari, it's hands down the best kind I've tried and trust me almost everywhere ", "I go "], "author": "Marissa G.", "review": "I can't ever get over this place, its my absolute favorite. \n\nI come here often and even more often do I order take out.

On my previous visit before tonight, I had a waitress who was not very friendly and lacked social skills. I want to feel welcomed, especially if I'm paying a crap load of money on a great meal.

Either the chef was able to whip up 2 roasted crabs and 2 orders of garlic noodles in under two minutes or they just reheated our food and served it to us (hmmmm). \n\nAs far as the food, it does not excite me as much as it use to. My roasted crab was pretty good, but it lacked garlic and was more peppery and salty (and greasy af). My garlic noodles were good but not as good as I remember them being.

The crab was seasoned with salt, pepper, and oil very similar to the salt and pepper calamari.\n\nShaken Beef\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thanh-long-san-francisco?select=t68CRJfgQs6m9rXDVE1ILA#DDbMAZwyv_gOBXaciovKGQ\nI really liked this dish, the beef was really tender and the sauce was delicious. Wasn't a huge fan of the salad/vegetables that came with the beef though. There wasn't enough sauce to flavor the vegetables.\n\nBanana Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thanh-long-san-francisco?select=t68CRJfgQs6m9rXDVE1ILA#t68CRJfgQs6m9rXDVE1ILA\nNever had banana cake before. This was pretty good. The cake was warm so went really well with the ice cream. There were slices of bananas in the cake =)\n\nOverall the food was pretty good and the service was pretty fast. We got our first dish about five minutes after we ordered it. It was a little pricy but I wouldn't mind going back some time to try their other dishes (really want to try the garlic noodles next time).", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-06-20"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered:\n\n*Salt and Pepper calamari - not your typical calamari at American restaurants and they don't provide any dipping sauces.

($10)\n\n*Roast Crab - this is what everyone gets!  A whole crab in their special garlic sauce. They gut the inside of main body for you so the head you get is nothing but the shell. The plate is buttered for your for your dipping pleasure.  (Market price ~$40 each crab)\n\n*Fried banana with ice cream - so delicious and really hits the spot.\n\nThe service was really fast, we never waited long for anything to come out.  They give you bowls to put your crab shells in.  They refilled our water like 5 times; they were on point with checking up on our table the whole night.

I made it a point to stop by here on our trip to SF. Aside from the reviews, I was also impressed by the story of the An family and empire. I'm Vietnamese so of course Vietnamese food is always an excellent choice in my book. The food here was good, but so ridiculously overhyped in my opinion. The garlic noodles tasted bland to me with not enough garlic and the crab was tasty but how can you ever go wrong with butter, crab, and pepper? You can really save yourself the $$$ and buy yourself crab, steam it, and make a dipping sauce using lemon and pepper (that's a traditional way to eat it in Vietnam). The food was good but not worth the effort or hype and our party was seriously disappointed. To further disappoint, this place really doesn't offer authentic Vietnamese cuisine. I personally think people need to venture to some hole in the wall Vietnamese place if they're handing out 5 star reviews to Thanh Long. At some point, I hope to try Crustacean to see if maybe the hype is limited to that brand in the An empire because Thanh Long is underwhelming and disappointing. \n\nOur party of 6 ordered the salt and pepper calamari, mango salad, crab puffs, roasted crabs, rice (why is this not included for a $20 entree!!!), spicy eggplant, and garlic noodles.

Salt and pepper calamari was good, but kind of a dish you can find at many other restaurants. The spicy eggplant dish had good flavor and lots of vegetables.

There was not much crab fat under the shell either. Perhaps they aren't sourcing their crab from a good provider.\n\nThen the garlic noodles arrived.

I knew they were a sister restaurant to Crustacean, but I have never been there either - though I have eaten their crab.\n\nThis restaurant is known for their \"roasted crab\" - and on this evening, Rob and I ordered an exorbitant amount of food.  As I gawked at what he was ordering, he said, \"Well we will reheat the leftovers for tomorrow.\"\n\nMade perfect sense to me!\n\nFirst, we ordered a bottle of Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($50).  We thought it'd pair nicely with all the dishes, and it did.  \n\nWe ordered salt and pepper calamari for an appetizer, got shaking beef, sea bass, garlic noodles, and roasted crab.\n\nI thought the calamari was excellent - lightly breaded, fried perfectly and while it's a deep-fried item, you don't feel like a hog eating this up.  Then came the garlic noodles - which was served along with the shaking beef and sea bass.  The noodles were outstanding - perfectly cooked and seasoned, tons of garlic (almost too much for my taste) and full of flavor.  The shaking beef was extremely \"Americanized\", if you will, being entirely too sweet for my palate, but it was good beef and went nicely with the noodles.  Sea bass, in my opinion, is a hard fish to mess up as it basically tastes great however you cook it as long as it's not overdone.  It does, however, need to be dressed up to really make the flavor stand out, or it risks being a bland fish.  While there was nothing wrong with how they cooked it - -  it was one of the few times I thought sea bass to be boring.  It needed a kick of some sort - desperately.\n\nThe crab arrives - and we dug right in.  The flavor was good, and it was served piping hot in a soup which consisted basically of butter.  Can't ask for more.  The crab itself was covered in pepper.  To say one will have to get messy is an understatement.  \n\nHaving said that - I don't consider this to be any better than Crustacean's crab.  Furthermore, perhaps because I have gone crabbing myself and had the freshest Dungeoness Crab one would eat straight out of the ocean and steamed alive on the spot - - it never crossed my mind that this was \"THE BEST\" I have had.  Very good - yes.  The best - - not quite!\n\nIt almost embarrasses me to report that not only did we finish every single thing we ordered - we hemmed and hawed over whether we should order one more crab.  After a few minutes, we did, and therein lied our mistake - - we waited too long to order and got fuller by the minute.  We ate about one leg each off the crab and packed the rest for home.  Well, at least we did have leftovers, like we intended.\n\nService was what was exceptional at this restaurant.  In particular, I am referring to our server - a young man who was the epitome of polite, attentive, friendly but professional all at the same time.  The few times we asked for anything - he got it immediately, and the rest of the time, we never needed a thing because he took such good care of us.  I was also impressed when he didn't bat an eye at how much food we ordered.\n\nYes, we ordered dessert.  (Don't forget, it's Rob and Grace here...)  Initially, Rob declined dessert but seriously, how does one refuse this:\n\n\"FRIED BANANA A LA MODE\"?\n\nWe ordered that and two Vietnamese Iced Coffees - - both were OUTSTANDING and a perfect grand finale to a gluttonous feast.\n\nThe meal was not cheap by any means - but it was a lot of food and we left happy.  The total bill closed in on $300 by the time we tipped.  \n\nWe had some plans to check out a few bars after dinner, making it a full date night.  The food comas that followed the meal prevented any outings and we headed straight home.  \n\nIn summary, Thanh Long is worth trying at least once.  While the ambiance is not \"romantic\" by any means, it's not grungy either.  It's ideal for a Sunday night family dinner (if you have reservations) or dinner with close friends.  It's nice for a casual date, but not quite up to \"impress the socks off\" level, if you know what I mean.  But with great service and good food, not to mention a pretty nice wine list, I am declaring that Thanh Long makes it onto my date list on Yelp.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-07-28"}, {"excerpts": ["roasted crab is amazing, salt and pepper calamari, and garlic noodles.

"], "author": "Gene C.", "review": "I came here with a friend from out of town looking for a competitor to PPQ Dungeness Island. The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.

A pregnant lady had let the male host know that they had a reservation and provided the name. He looked up the name and asked if she had a reservation, she said \"yes\". And he asked again, she said the name, he affirmed the name and asked AGAIN if they had a reservation. She again replied \"yes\". It was so bizarre that I was tempted to intervene and maybe help the host understand that she said \"yes, she has a reservation\". We were at the bar and could clearly hear him asking the same question over and over. And she was clearly saying yes they have a reservation under the name he said. Then he told her to wait until her husband showed up. WTF. Strange that he didn't just seat them. The place was not crowded nor was there anyone waiting to be seated.

Not as flavorful, but still very, very good nonetheless. \nCreme Brulee (2 orders) - My dad and Anhie T. thought this was the best dessert dish.\nBanana Cake - I liked this dish and everyone else didn't like it.  Served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, a dallop of whip cream, this cake seemed to be made out of only bananas.  Anhie T. said it was bland.  I disagree.\nHot Chocolate Cake - served with Vanilla ice cream...this was good.  Really rich though.\nCoke (2 glasses) - served from their bar in a tall, slim glass.  No free refills.\n\nTotal bill with tax + tip came out to $218.\n\nThis was my parents first time here and they loved the crab, and garlic noodles.  They did say it was a bit oily, but c'mon, roasted crab and garlic noodles anywhere is a bit oily.  But here's a good sign.  As they left, they took some business cards.  That means they liked their food and they'll be back...probably with some family friends!\n\nDepending on my the mood (and thickness of the wallet), I would come back.  \n\nBut other substitutions are very comparable:  PPQ is cheaper and quality isn't far behind, while Crustacean is a tad more expensive, but swankier....\n\nTip 'o the day:  Avoid the valet parking outside.

Minus a half a star for the value of some of the items but overall a terrific night out.\n\nThis is a prize of a place. Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order. The prawns did have a tendency to stick to their shells, but they were perfectly done and marinated in some fantastic sauce to make them outstanding.\n\nThe Garlic noodles had the perfect consistency of Yee Noodles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_mein, which gives them an extra nice bite and appear to absorb the flavors better. They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Loved the Dungeness crab puffs.

The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.

My Mom was mad and irritated because to her it didn't make sense because we knew what they wanted to order. After practically yelling at the hostess, they still didn't seat us - I was embarassed. The hostess remained calm and tried to explain to my Mom why they wouldn't seat us. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know why they won't sit full parties - it puts their entire reservation schedule off track - if two people of a seven party table is late, it extends their duration at the table once the two LATE people do get there, and causes the table who will be using that table next a delay, and so forth throughout the evening. \n\n30 minutes after our reservation time, my late sibling and her guest arrived, I kindly let the hostess know that we were finally all there, she told me that the only table available that sits 7 is currently paying and as soon as they leave, she'd be able to sit us - this was \"the best that she could do at this time.\" - I thanked her nicely and proceeded to apologize for my mom's reaction and that I understand why they couldn't seat us. \n\n5 minutes later - she came to me and said that she had another table available and we could be seated right away.

The Parents are notoriously picky about food and the Dad is particularly so when it comes to crab. It has to be fresh, can't be over-seasoned and has to be meaty. Thank goodness for Thanh Long. We ordered the mango salad, Dungeness crab puffs, ginger calamari, Drunken Crab, Roast Crab and the garlic rice. The Boyfriend and I had heard that people loved the garlic noodles but the Parents didn't like the looks of it so the Boyfriend and I again followed the advice of our friend and ordered some garlic rice. In terms of food, Thanh Long gets five stars. The Parents loved the food. The ginger calamari was well-seasoned, not too gingery and not too salty. It was particularly yummy with the pineapples. The mango salad was delicious (it has shrimp and scallops as well) and the garlic rice was flavorful without being overpowering. The Dungeness crab puffs were a big hit but pricey. It was basically a tastier version of crab rangoon. Now for the crab: right before ordering, the Boyfriend and I faithfully checked Yelp and some had said that the Roast Crab was too salty. The Dad isn't too fond of wine-reduction so we tried the Roast Crab first. It was delicious and not too salty at all. The waiter comes over with plastic bibs and you get to cracking (well...the Boyfriend and the Dad got to cracking and then fed the Mom and me bits and pieces). One crab is about enough for one person to be full. One crab is about enough to make two grown men half-full so calculate accordingly. We ordered the Drunken Crab to mix things up and it was also good. It tastes much more Asian in that the wine reduction really saves the flavor of the crab - it's much more crabby than the Roast crab which is more seasoned.

The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.

I just had to order a second one ;)  We also tried the Buddha roll as a started, lacking in size but excelling in taste, i would definitely recommend it. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RRbjQc-TiIc9VU9BYS-wWw/l Being a Protein fiend, i wanted more protein with our dinner so we decided to get the Saigon beef too. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/td1A4gpMLMU2VIIIfjEp0g/l The beef was very tender and had marvelous flavoring to it on top of a bed of salad. Perfect! it came with veggies! ;). Thanh Long was definitely worth the 30min wait but I know next time to MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!  Also its probably best to go during crab season, it can be steep when crabs are not in season.

We did not drive all the way to the outer sunset for frozen crab!!!!  On top of all that, our \"smart\" waiter gave us the crab, without our garlic noodles.  So the fool had us eating the crab without any complementing food.\n\nAnd lastly, the garlic noodles.  Average.  It came out cold.  Usually, these noodles do no retain heat, so I do not expect it too be hot, however cold is unacceptable.  \n\nIf Thanh Long is dishing out fast-food version of their food and service, they should dish out those same prices, so expectations will be lowered.

On my previous visit before tonight, I had a waitress who was not very friendly and lacked social skills. I want to feel welcomed, especially if I'm paying a crap load of money on a great meal. Tonight I had a waiter who would only talk to me and would not acknowledge my grandma (can we say awkward and weird). \n\nOn my previous visit, I received my crab way before my garlic noodles. Uhhhhh I would like to eat my HOT crab with my HOT garlic noodles. I don't want COLD crab with HOT garlic noodles. Tonight after my grandma and I ordered, we literally received our food 5 minutes later. Either the chef was able to whip up 2 roasted crabs and 2 orders of garlic noodles in under two minutes or they just reheated our food and served it to us (hmmmm). \n\nAs far as the food, it does not excite me as much as it use to. My roasted crab was pretty good, but it lacked garlic and was more peppery and salty (and greasy af). My garlic noodles were good but not as good as I remember them being. I also want to mention that my food went cold pretty quickly (that's what happens when you reheat food...let me stop lol).\n\nI will say there are some good appetizers like the salt and pepper calamari and the shrimp toast. I also like their fried rice and heard their mango salad is delicious as well. I've had the Tiger Prawns on garlic noodles and it was really good (it was my very first meal here).\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to someone who has never experienced the infamous roasted crab and garlic noodles or just want to say they've been here.

So in addition, I got the mango salad and seafood dumpling.  And also the steamed sea bass entree.\n\nRoast crab was just ok.  I prefer PPQ and the salt & pepper fried crab at R&G more.  Thanh Long's crab was flavorful but over peppered and garlic oiled at times.  The weak part was the tamale in the shell.  It seemed like it was cleaned out a bit and the crab wasn't as big as it usually is.  Maybe its not so in season now but they should still be reserving colossal size crabs for their dishes.  We had the prawns with garlic noodles.  The prawns very overdone a bit and had too much buttery/pepper smeared over it.  It was cholesterol city last night.\n\nMango salad too my surprise had stir fried shrimp and onions on top making the salad a bit warm and welted.\n\nSeafood dumpling seem like it was heated in the microwave and had a dry appearance.\n\nBoth salad and dumpling came out super fast.\n\nSea bass was over done too and just wasn't as smooth as it should be.  Sea bass ain't suppose to taste \"meaty\".  I think a filet-o-fish has an even more delicate flaky texture.  I would rather had two filet-o-fish sandwiches on that big plate instead of the sea bass.\n\nNo plate presentation on anything.\n\nOrdered a pineapple lychee martini before ordering food but it never came and the food did.  I had to ask and then they said they were all out of the infusion?  So I tried a passion tea martini which came after the entrees.  So it sat there getting warm as I started to eat and didn't feel like drinking it anymore.  It was nice when it was straight cold.  \n\nServer who took our order never came back to ask what's up with the food.  Instead the runner asked?  Pretty whack on service.\n\n$41.95 for the crab is totally not worth it.  I would pay 20 bucks at most.  In fact, I can make this at home and I do every time crab season starts.  Go to sunset supermarket or new may wah and get some live crabs and cook it up at home.

But I can't help but make comparisons. \n\nPPQ has the best value for the food. Thanh Long is definitely cheaper than Crustacean, but by no means a casual dining option. The roasted crab runs at market price and happened to be $40 on this particular night. \n\nAs far as the garlic noodles, I have to rank Crustacean's as the best, PPQ in second and Thanh Long 3rd.

The mango salad was a nice surprise. It was warm and I wasn't sure what to think about that, but it was good. Salt and pepper calamari was good, but kind of a dish you can find at many other restaurants. The spicy eggplant dish had good flavor and lots of vegetables.

We have a friend who raves about it, but somehow we never made it.  I finally tried Thanh Long last weekend with our friend, and now I understand why she speaks so highly of this restaurant.  I am also regretting that I could have been there a few more times by now instead of just once.\n\nLast Saturday we had a late dinner.  Driving to the restaurant my friend warned me that we would probably have to wait awhile for a table.  I don't mind waiting if the food is good.  However when we arrived we were seated immediately.  It was late, maybe 9:00PM on a Saturday, so if you can wait for a late dinner this may be the time to come.\n\nLooking at the other tables, it was easy to see what to order.  Every table was the same -- garlic noodles and roasted crab.  We started with a mango salad, which was totally yum.  Then the real bomb -- the garlic noodles.  They are simple, I could totally make this at home, but OMG they are awesome!  We also split a roast dungeness crab, another dish that I frequently make when crab is in season, but sometimes it is nice to sit down and enjoy a good meal without having to cook it.\n\nFor the meal we ordered, the Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc which turned out to be a PERFECT PAIRING to our food.  I was proud of myself for going past the rather large Chardonnay selection on the wine list.  I think  the buttery flavor of a California Cardonnay would have been in competition with the other flavors on the table, so I wonder why they had so many on the list?  A white with a little more acidity and fruit was just the ticket.  I had only tried Duckhorn's reds prior to this evening, but I must say the Sauvignon Blanc was remarkable and I will seek out a bottle for home next time I am serving crab.  I usually go for Voigner with shellfish, but they didn't have one to offer...why?  You are  a classy restaurant, get your wines sorted please.\n\nI withhold the fifth star because I'm not that easy.  Thanh Long was a great meal and I will definitely take my wife here when she gets back in town, but it is really priced high.  With tip, dinner for two where we shared a mango salad, split an order of garlic noodles, and had only one crab between us with a bottle of wine was $175 with tip.  Ouch!  My wallet stings a bit.

I think the food most of time tastes a lot better and 2.

Thanh Long has really, really, good food.\n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and my hats off to the bartender.  I'm not a big drinker at all.  That said, I think every person should have a signature drink.  For me, it's Drambuie.  Because it's not an average drink and only consumed by the most worldly of people (ah-em), I can tell instantly the status of a restaurant when I order it and the waiter says \"huh, what's that?\"  Or the bartender simply smiles and says, \"I'm sorry sir, we don't have that.\"  He knows that you know, the sophistication of their restaurant is FOS at that point.\n\nThanh Long serves Drambuie.

Steamed in pepper and other seasoning with just enough of a buttery hint that I was sitting at the table licking my fingers.  Yeah, I know. No table etiquette, but at that point I didn't care.

When we enter, it's a completely different story--dimmed lighting, modern decor, tablecloths, etc.  We are ~10 minutes late (parking was a pain in the neighborhood), yet they seat us promptly.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful (they helped us pick out items for our group and make recommendations based on our party size). I order a bottle of wine that ends up being a twist-cap, but our waiter still makes the motions and lets me sample first.  When it comes time for eating, the staff helps us put on our bibs, brings extra napkins without having to be asked, and replaces our plates and bowls whenever things started to get messy.  Oh yeah, and brownie points on attentiveness--my water never goes empty.

You might need a coronary bypass after going through the Thanh Long Mussels, Roast Crab, and Garlic Noodles, but it's worth every cent of your health insurance deductible if you have it.  You see the oil on the plates,  but with every bite, your senses don't register it as \"just\" oil.  Instead, a bite of the garlic noodles dressed with some drippings from the roast crab feels like your mouth is being coated in silken, mouth-filling luxury.  As you swallow, you are overwhelmed with a noise in your head--that noise is your brain screaming, \"MORE MORE MORE!!!\"\n\nPure crack.\n\nWhen the bill comes, we see gratuity tagged on, but it's pre-tax and pre-alcohol (as with everything else, Thanh Long gets it right).

We had reservations for 4 for my brother's birthday dinner two nights ago, and needless to say, I will NEVER return! The food was comparable to a buffet in Reno. \n\nGarlic Noodles were lacking. It didn't taste anything of fresh garlic. Instead, the noodles were soggy and overcooked, with the flavor of garlic salt.\n\nMango salad was probably the only tolerable dish we had that night. The vinaigrette was light and sweet, but the portion was pretty small.\n\nThe shaken beef was a huge disappointment. The entire bottom of the plate was covered in chopped romaine lettuce, but was hidden under beef, giving the impression that the plate was full of beef. In addition, there were ample chopped potatoes sauteed to LOOK like beef. There were maybe a total of 9 piece of actual beef on the plate, for about $20-$25. \n\nThe sea bass was absolutely bland. It was cooked with no seasoning, AT ALL. The saving grace for this dish was the accompanying sauce on the side, which had a slight sweet, citrus flavor to it. For $25, the serving of sea bass is smaller than the average portion for one person. There was ONE bok choy cut into thirds on the side of this dish. I'm pretty sure bok choy i s$0.79/lb at the supermarket. If you're gonna skimp on the portion of the fish, you could at least use more than one bok choy.\n\nThanh Long has always had a special place in my heart for their crab. No more. The roast crab we ordered came out lukewarm. This would've been tolerable had the crab actually had flavor. It looked like it was covered in black pepper, but had no taste at all = pre-ground black pepper. I RARELY use salt to cook, and my usual complaint when I eat out is that the food is too salty. This crab didn't have even a pinch of salt in it! They used to use so much butter in their sauce that when it cooled, the bottom of the dish would be covered in coagulated butter.

Stick to the roasted crab instead of the tamarind crab.  The sauce on the tamarind crab is a little sweet for my taste buds.  The Thanh Long spicy eggplant is good, but nowhere near spicy.

Is it because I am Vietnamese, or is it because I've made crab better at home myself?  To say that I was greatly, nay sorely, disappointed would be putting it lightly.  \n\nI had heard from 2 different friends who also love food that I should try this restaurant, so I finally went with great excitement and anticipation.  I even schlepped out on a rainy, windy miserable night where I could've just sat at home eating ramen and been happy.\n\nThe dinner started off well enough with the salt and pepper calamari and the mango salad.  My fleur de mango mixed drink was decent but tasted more like banana and coconut than mango.  Boyfriend's pineapple ginger-infused vodka was better.\n\nSurprisingly, though, the biggest disappointments were the restaurant specialties that have seemingly made this restaurant famous:  the roasted crab and garlic noodles.  The crab was small and mealy, and once you suck away the tasty salt and pepper sauce from the outer shell, you're left with bland, crumbly crab that did not taste fresh or well-cooked.  There was not much crab fat under the shell either. Perhaps they aren't sourcing their crab from a good provider.\n\nThen the garlic noodles arrived.  My impression can be summarized as the following:  meh.  I'm pretty sure I can reproduce the same dish with some spaghetti and a lot of butter and garlic.\n\nBoyfriend thinks that I should come back and give them a second chance because any restaurant can have an off night, but given how sad it was and given that the highlight of the meal was when said boyfriend sent a crab leg flying, barely missing the lady sitting next to us when he tried to pry it off the crab body , I'm gun shy to say the least.  His response actually was, \"Well, as least it's one less leg we have to eat.\"  If that doesn't speak volumes, not sure what else would.\n\nI'd rather blow all of my money on the salt and pepper crab at R&G Lounge.

Villager's Favorite - Pacific prawns & pork medallions simmered in a caramelized reduction of soy and herbs; I liked this dish enough that I would order it again; a nice take on a \"surf and turf\" with pork instead of beef for the \"turf\" portion\n\n5. Shaken Beef - tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes; delicious in flavor with fork tender beef; the greens I could do without as it seemed more a \"salad\" than an entree\n\n6. Vegetarian Delight - silken tofu sauteed with asst. vegetables & shitake mushrooms; a standout as I love tofu and veggies!\n\n7. Roast Crab - a whole Dungeness crab roasted with An's garlic sauce & secret spices in the Secret Kitchen; regardless of what others may say, this in of itself is a delectable Dungeness crab entree!  Yes it's messy but who cares?  The flavors marry very well and our entire party enjoyed this dish.\n\n8. Garlic Noodles - An's famous noodles made with their secret garlic sauce (perhaps the one used on the Roast Crab?) & secret spices; this noodle dish is good when hot but at room temperature or worse, cold, it's not that good (something coagulates on the noodles when it's cold...butter perhaps?)\n\nDespite the large amounts ordered per item, we had lots of left overs (crab included) for our party of 18.

We were seated immediately, and looked over the menu, and ordered the following:\n\nCrispy Rice Paper Roll ($7.50) - your standard Vietnamese Egg Roll.  But here you get once egg roll cut into four pieces.\nThanh Long Mussells ($10.95) - five mussells served with five slices of thin garlic bread.  This dish was delicious.\nSteamed Sea Bass ($24.95) - sea bass was flaky, moist, and really good.  The sauce was sweet and gingery.\nStuffed Calamari ($15.95) - lots of calamari stuffed with minced meat in a tomato based sauce.  Parents didn't like it so much, but I thought it was okay.\nShaken Beef ($20.95) - very flavorful, and a dish that everyone loved.  The beef was tender and potatoes were flavorful.\nGarlic Noodles (2 orders at $9.50 ea) - Garlicky and delicious! \nRoast Crab (I think it was $38) - really good crab...but compared to Crustaceans, it's not the same.  Not as flavorful, but still very, very good nonetheless. \nCreme Brulee (2 orders) - My dad and Anhie T. thought this was the best dessert dish.\nBanana Cake - I liked this dish and everyone else didn't like it.  Served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, a dallop of whip cream, this cake seemed to be made out of only bananas.  Anhie T. said it was bland.  I disagree.\nHot Chocolate Cake - served with Vanilla ice cream...this was good.  Really rich though.\nCoke (2 glasses) - served from their bar in a tall, slim glass.  No free refills.\n\nTotal bill with tax + tip came out to $218.\n\nThis was my parents first time here and they loved the crab, and garlic noodles.  They did say it was a bit oily, but c'mon, roasted crab and garlic noodles anywhere is a bit oily.  But here's a good sign.  As they left, they took some business cards.  That means they liked their food and they'll be back...probably with some family friends!\n\nDepending on my the mood (and thickness of the wallet), I would come back.  \n\nBut other substitutions are very comparable:  PPQ is cheaper and quality isn't far behind, while Crustacean is a tad more expensive, but swankier....\n\nTip 'o the day:  Avoid the valet parking outside.

Came here for my friend's b-day dinner.  A crab specialty restaurant in the outer...OUTER sunset next to the cold, foggy beach.  A bit of a trek with many other similar places more east on Clement St.  You walk in and you will be greeted by the host (reservations are encouraged as it is a BUSY place even during the week) with a bar on the right.  It is fully stocked and we all got a glass of Oban for a pricey number.\n\nWhen seated about 10 minutes after our reservation was actually for we had a great server.  Surrounded by an interesting decor we ordered as appetizers calamari and oysters.  I didn't have the oysters but the calamari was well cooked but over seasoned if you ask me.  It was peppery which I do like but way too salty.   Because I love calamari, I ate much of the order but was invited to enjoy a long period of salty tongue and 2 glasses of ice water.  For the mains, we had crab which is the specialty, \"shaken\" beef, garlic noodles and seabass.   Crab was well cooked and tender.  The shaken beef was cooked medium to the \"T.\"  The seabass also tasty with the sauce it comes with but perhaps just a touch overcooked.  Finally, the garlic noodles were also very tasty if you LOVE garlic.  If garlic is only a passing notion in your home cooking you will think this is romantic disaster when it comes to post-dinner make-out sessions.\n\nLastly, because the portions are on the smaller side we had to order an extra dish for the 4 of us...the curry lotus prawns.  This had to be the worst of all our selections.  The shrimp were over cooked and tiny....oh whoops, weren't they called \"prawns\" on the menu???  In any case, the curry was bland and even if you liked it, there was barely enough curry sauce to mix into you rice like many expect in a Thai type curry house.  The veggies it comes with were....eh.  Water chestnuts were ok.  The baby corn tasted like canned baby corn.  All-in-all I'd leave this off your choices to order...\n\nSo in summary, a fancy, pricey Vietnamese crab house at the beach in SF.  A fun place to visit if you live locally and enjoy it.

You can eat other stuff but there needs to be a crab as part of your order.  They don't come cheap either; market price for my recent visit was slightly above 50 dollars per crab.  My family got the roasted garlic and drunken one, which is a funny way of saying champagne and alcohol flavored.  I preferred the roasted garlic one but wish they had served up some baguettes or something so I could soak up the crab back juices. Sounds gross but it's delicious!  The drunken one was okay but nothing to rave about. I would not order again. For our party of 5, 2 crabs was filling enough.  We also got the shaken beef and fried calamari.  Both were decent but my preference would have been to have some rice with either dishes, which weren't available.  Oh well, blame it on my being too Asian.\n\nTwo people helped wait on our table and the service was really split.  One lady seemed like we were bothering her while the man checked on us often.  Inconsistency is probably their theme these days as evident by the other reviews on here. Five stars here with a few 1 and 2 star reviews there.

Although, they have very limited parking because it is in the city and around a residential area, they provide Valet!  I recommend valet unless you get lucky enough to park in front of the restaurant but goodluck!  Its either street parking or valet because they don't have a private lot.\n\nWhen we go here, we usually dress more business casual but it totally doesn't matter, you'll get your hands dirty anyways.  The outside of the restaurant doesn't look very pleasing/fancy but the inside looks 10x better!  We ALWAYS ALWAYS make a reservation because they get very busy, especially during the weekends.  The waiting area is quite small but they have a full bar where you can sit, wait, and have a drink.  The restaurant isn't the biggest and it gets a little tight in there, but fortunately, they do have an upstairs area.\n\nTheir customer service here is perfect.  They aren't overwhelming, but they are quick to refill your water, and they're always walking around, that way if you need something they're easily accessible.  Everyone is quick, friendly, Americanized (no racial) and professional.\n\nThe food is astounding!  We start off with ordering the Salt & Pepper Calamari, sounds plain, but it's the most flavorful calamari ever.  My boyfriend and I always share 1 crab because they are HUGE with lots of meat.  There are different flavors of crab but our favorite is the Roast Crab.  We've tried the others but Roast Crab is my all-time favorite.  We order garlic noodles on the side and the fried banana with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  The traditional Vietnamese salad and mango salad is bomb, very light but good.  If you do want to order some type of meat, the Shaken beef is super tender and melts in your mouth!  EVERYTHING IS JUST DELICIOUS AND HEAVENLY.\n\nThe food is comparable to PPQ, if you've ever been there, however, Thanh Long is more expensive but you get what you pay for!  I think PPQ is more on the casual side but if you want to be a little fancier, Thanh Long is the place.\n\nYou will not walk out of here disappointed!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-12-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I've never been a fan of shaken beef anywhere, but this place's was okay.

The crab came out so quick, one can probably assume it was pre-made in the kitchen. First, it wasn't even hot on the inside. It appears they roast the crabs and leave the garlic oil and seasoning until its ordered. Then they pour the seasoning and oil on top of the crab to make it hot again. also the crab was 1.5 lbs or so. I can get that size crab at Ranch 99 or something for $7.99/lb. So about $12 for that same size crab that I had to pay $55 for. That seasoning isn't worth $43! \n\nWith that said, the seasoning and taste itself was good. Just not worth the price. We also had shaken beef which was good. But again portion vs. price, not worth it. \n\nWe also had crab puff and garlic noodles.

We ordered some of their staple dishes: Shaken Beef - 5 stars. Colossal Prawns served with garlic noodles - 4 stars. (I'm not really a shrimp person) Spicy eggplant with Chicken - 5 stars. Just enough spice with a ton of flavor. The sweet and spicy sauce was killer! We didn't order crab since we're both not into crab really. (And frankly, I'm lazy to eat that stuff) We didn't have enough room for dessert so we skipped that. Our waitress was super nice, fast and very attentive!

Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order. The prawns did have a tendency to stick to their shells, but they were perfectly done and marinated in some fantastic sauce to make them outstanding.\n\nThe Garlic noodles had the perfect consistency of Yee Noodles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_mein, which gives them an extra nice bite and appear to absorb the flavors better. They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["The crab was lukewarm, the noodles were okay, and the only redeeming dish was the Shaken Beef which was still tender and delicious.\n\n"], "author": "Nette T.", "review": "Oh Thanh Long, how I loved thee.\n\nI went there ages ago (like during the early 90s), and remembered the crab being AH-MAH-ZING.\n\nI went with out of town friends and was underwhelmed.

My mind wondered, 'are cokes refillable?'...'where are the restrooms?'...'how much is 'market price'?'...'does the waiter know I'm not really paying attention?'\n\nBack to reality...'did he say 500 hundred crabs?'  Where do they even keep that many crabs laying around I thought.  At that point, I wasn't sure if he mentioned it already, so to save some possible embarrassment I didn't inquire about the crabs, nodded, and just asked...'where are the restrooms?' \n\nParking was more difficult than I expected as street parking sucked that day.  My laziness within grew with valet parking available tempting me.  The outrageous cost of $12 bucks and the thought of someone joy riding in my valuable antique of a Corolla didn't sit well with me.  The Sunset weather by the water was its usual half dreary self.  Contrast to the outside, inside the restaurant was vibrant and warm.  Aroma of good times filled the place; passing each table we saw at least one crab on the table.  Hold those horses...part of the waiter's yada yada yada included \"90% of people order the crab\".  \n\nIf it were me, our order would have consisted of all crab and garlic noodles.  Due to food allergies and cholesterol consciousness at the table, a full spectrum of dishes was chosen.  \n\nOUR ORDER:     \n*Lemongrass chicken satay - These grilled chicken skewers come numbering around three or four.  This was the first item that came out and everyone was hungry.  Playing the disappearing act in a poof, I only ate a sliver of a sliver sized piece.  My taste buds do not recall anything negative.  There were no complaints either.  \n\n*Salt & pepper calamari - One of my sister's go to dishes no matter where, when, and how.  How can you go wrong with deep fried calamari?  You can't; unless they were soggy which these were not.  Salt and pepper were abundantly prevalent throughout.  The chunks of calamari were a larger size calamari than usual.  Bigger means more calamari meat and less batter.  Less batter is typically good thing.  \n\n*Shaken beef - Shaken, not stirred...I didn't taste the \"shaken\", but the cubes of meat were very tender.  Served on a bed of green and mixed in with some potato, the meat has a sharp peppery taste.  I recommend this for people with seafood allergies that come here.    \n  \n*Lemongrass chicken - Didn't I order something with lemongrass as an appetizer already?  I repeated \"lemongrass\" a couple times under my breath unsure of this when ordering.  We needed another dish for the non-seafood eaters at the table anyway.  Consisting of probably all dark meat, the chicken was very simplistically lemongrass-ed.  There were more bell peppers than I would have liked.  The noticeable echo of pepper flavor popped up again.  I wonder how much pepper this restaurant uses in a day.   \n\n*\"Colossal\" royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles - My main chagrin about this plate was the adjective \"colossal\" attached to the prawns.  All the pictures I saw, they looked humongous.  I bet the picture I took even look gigantic.  Truly, it is an optical illusion.  While unexpectedly smaller they were also a smidgen on the salty side for me.  Overdosed on seasoning, the prawns sat on top of garlic noodles.  The spillover of seasoning into the garlic noodles unassumingly enhanced the noodles.  The garlic noodles are good by themselves; the extra touch of seasoning really made the whole that much better.  If I go again, I'll pass on this one, but was decent. \n\n*Roast crab - Presentation is absolutely photogenic.  I'm talking about super model level.  The crab was very meaty and a nice size.  They really saved the best for last, as this was the last entr\u00e9e to be served.  Cut down the middle with all the legs intact, the shell of the crab is ornamentally placed on top of the legs.  Their \"garlic sauce and secret sauce\" fully cooked into the crab meat and needless to say, I started to dip some noodles in the dressing.  It was good stuff.  To nitpick, freshness rating of the crab wasn't A+, rather an A-.    \n \n*Steamed rice - That's how my dad rolls.  Can't go anywhere without it.  I had to add this one or it wouldn't be a complete review.  The white rice came in a bowl and tasted...rice-like.  My dad thoroughly enjoyed it with a big smile.\n\nThanh Long is an Americanized Vietnamese restaurant that is versatile enough to draw even the most Asian of Asians.  If you read the articles down the hallway to the restroom, there's a feel good story behind restaurant's owners (Remember that question about where the restrooms were?

Thanh Long is definitely cheaper than Crustacean, but by no means a casual dining option. The roasted crab runs at market price and happened to be $40 on this particular night. \n\nAs far as the garlic noodles, I have to rank Crustacean's as the best, PPQ in second and Thanh Long 3rd. However, that being said, all three are fantastic and worth a try.\n\nCrustacean obviously wins in the ambiance category, but Thanh Long is a very nice, quaint place. I like that Thanh Long impresses and is appropriate from anything from a romantic date to a fun family dinner.  \n\nEnough comparisons, let's talk about Thanh Long's food. The mango salad was a nice surprise. It was warm and I wasn't sure what to think about that, but it was good. Salt and pepper calamari was good, but kind of a dish you can find at many other restaurants. The spicy eggplant dish had good flavor and lots of vegetables. We had chicken fried rice (mostly for the baby) which was your typical chicken fried rice. The shaken beef was a definite stand out dish. It was super tender and the flavor was wonderful.\n\nMy only gripe about the crab was they didn't leave the shell with all the juices and good stuff. The shell was turned over and we had to dig around to find some fat (which of course is one of the best parts!).\n\nBy the way, skip the drinks here. They come in tiny glasses that are much overpriced. \n\nAll in all I will probably stick with PPQ as my go to, but Thanh Long is definitely a good option for a special occasion.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-01-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Calamari was ok, Shaken beef and crab were good.

I called on the Thursday before to make a reservation, made it for 5:30pm on Mother's Day. Perfect. They called on Saturday to confirm, awesome. They reminded me to make sure everyone was on time because we wouldn't be sat until our entire party was there. \n\nTypical of our family, one of my siblings was running late - therefore they wouldn't seat us. My Mom was mad and irritated because to her it didn't make sense because we knew what they wanted to order. After practically yelling at the hostess, they still didn't seat us - I was embarassed. The hostess remained calm and tried to explain to my Mom why they wouldn't seat us. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know why they won't sit full parties - it puts their entire reservation schedule off track - if two people of a seven party table is late, it extends their duration at the table once the two LATE people do get there, and causes the table who will be using that table next a delay, and so forth throughout the evening. \n\n30 minutes after our reservation time, my late sibling and her guest arrived, I kindly let the hostess know that we were finally all there, she told me that the only table available that sits 7 is currently paying and as soon as they leave, she'd be able to sit us - this was \"the best that she could do at this time.\" - I thanked her nicely and proceeded to apologize for my mom's reaction and that I understand why they couldn't seat us. \n\n5 minutes later - she came to me and said that she had another table available and we could be seated right away. While following her she told me that she appreciated my apology and to enjoy my meal. \n\nFood: \nDungeness Crab Puffs - delicious - a great appetizer for a larger group, there were 6 in one serving. \n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari - a little too much salt on this one, still good though!

"], "author": "Andrew W.", "review": "This place serves some very incredible food and some very good food, but it is very pricey.  For $38 dollars, you get one crab in a variety of styles.  The best here is the roasted crab.  It is delightfully buttery and peppery.  The sauce is so good, it inspired my sister to toss her entire bowl of rice into what was essentially a whole lot of crab flavored butter.  Calories be damned.  So, this dish was good.\n\nI was less impressed by the drunken crab.  It was a little on the bland side.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, but the broth was kind of dull and watery.  It could have used a lot more flavor.  The crab was fresh, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nWe also got the shaken beef, which is beef marinaded in a sweet, salty sauce served with vegetables.  It was very tender.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The vegetables complimented the meat very well.  But, the fried potatoes were a bit weird.  I would get this dish again.\n\nThe other good thing here is the garlic noodles.  FYI, it tastes like it has some fish sauce or oyster sauce or crab broth in it.  So, if you are vegetarian beware.  The presentation is really poor.  They come out looking like very ordinary tan noodles.  But, the flavor is salty and sweet with a nice garlic flavor.  It is a bit more on the sweeter side than I expected.  But, it was very good.\n\nWe also had the boulliabaisse, the salmon carpaccio, the soft shell crabs, the mixed seasonal vegetables and the sea bass.  The soft shell crabs are a definite miss.  They lacked seasoning.  The batter was not that crispy.  It was a below average dish.\n\nThe boulliabaisse was a nice fish broth with vegetables floating in it and some rock shrimp that were cooked well.  It was ok.  Just think Tom Yum soup.  Nothing really special.\n\nThe salmon carpaccio was tasty.  The shallots added a nice contrast to the sweet salmon.  But, the portion was very small.\n\nThe mixed seasonal vegetables were well cooked, but ultimately they were just roasted vegetables.  Nothing special.\n\nFinally, the sea bass was a little overcooked.  The sauce was nice and mild.  It was ok.  But, nothing special.  It came with some vegetables in a light sauce.  \n\nI also had a mixed drink.  It was a bit on the sweet side.  FYI, the food here is not spicy, so fruity drinks do not pair well.  It is better to go with one of the dry white wines.  For a Vietnamese place, they don't use a lot of sour flavors, so the dry wine brings a little acidity to the food and makes the flavors come out.\n\nThe dessert menu was not very exciting.  Deep fried banana, chocolate molten cake.  All the standard stuff.  Nothing unusual or complicated.  We skipped it.\n\nThe service was typical for an Asian restaurant.  Not very attentive.  But, everyone was well dressed.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and surprisingly modern inside.  Outside, it looks like a dumpy Chinese restaurant in the Sunset.  But, there are some nice silks and figurines decorating the interior of the restaurant.  This is a good place for a special occasion meal or for a date although the clientele is a bit on the older side (mid to late 40s).  So, it is not exactly hip.  But, your date will appreciate the decor and the high quality food.\n\nA word about parking.  Come early.  Parking in the Sunset is horrible.  You might have to walk a few blocks.  Our reservations were for 6 and we had to walk 2 blocks.  If you eat around 7, be prepared for a hike.  They have valet car service.

A bit of a trek with many other similar places more east on Clement St.  You walk in and you will be greeted by the host (reservations are encouraged as it is a BUSY place even during the week) with a bar on the right.  It is fully stocked and we all got a glass of Oban for a pricey number.\n\nWhen seated about 10 minutes after our reservation was actually for we had a great server.  Surrounded by an interesting decor we ordered as appetizers calamari and oysters.  I didn't have the oysters but the calamari was well cooked but over seasoned if you ask me.  It was peppery which I do like but way too salty.   Because I love calamari, I ate much of the order but was invited to enjoy a long period of salty tongue and 2 glasses of ice water.  For the mains, we had crab which is the specialty, \"shaken\" beef, garlic noodles and seabass.   Crab was well cooked and tender.  The shaken beef was cooked medium to the \"T.\"  The seabass also tasty with the sauce it comes with but perhaps just a touch overcooked.  Finally, the garlic noodles were also very tasty if you LOVE garlic.  If garlic is only a passing notion in your home cooking you will think this is romantic disaster when it comes to post-dinner make-out sessions.\n\nLastly, because the portions are on the smaller side we had to order an extra dish for the 4 of us...the curry lotus prawns.  This had to be the worst of all our selections.  The shrimp were over cooked and tiny....oh whoops, weren't they called \"prawns\" on the menu???  In any case, the curry was bland and even if you liked it, there was barely enough curry sauce to mix into you rice like many expect in a Thai type curry house.  The veggies it comes with were....eh.  Water chestnuts were ok.  The baby corn tasted like canned baby corn.  All-in-all I'd leave this off your choices to order...\n\nSo in summary, a fancy, pricey Vietnamese crab house at the beach in SF.  A fun place to visit if you live locally and enjoy it.

When dungeness is out of season, it can be pricey (I think we've paid as much as $54 once - when we were desperate) but otherwise, on price (usually about $27 - $37), it's comparable to other places while beating the pants of other places in terms of flavor.\n\nI love the garlic roasted crab and hubs loves the drunken crab.

(BTW, is it my imagination or have those bibs gotten smaller?  Or is it just that my belly has gotten bigger??) Oh- and a tip for those who don't eat the crab but are dining with someone (or next to someone) who is: request a bib for yourself. Otherwise, beware flying crab juice, crab meat pieces, or droplets of garlic sauce. \n\nThe garlic noodles (also impossible to duplicate at home!) are delish and there's enough in one order to share between two - unless you're with a pregnant woman and then beware any who dare approach the plate until she's finished.

All of them charge at least  $7.95+ , but I was so surprise when the waiter delivered us the plates, the buddha rice role has only one thin veggie rice role and cut into four pieces, for 8 bucks? this is insane, the crab puffs plate came with 6 fortune cookies with crab paste. And the shrimp toast came with 5 slices of shrimp pate over bacquets.  We also ordered roasted crab which is market price on the menu, the crab tasted pretty good, but it wasn't difficult dish to make, after all it is only roasted with salt, black pepper and butter, and it is about 1.5 lb, the restaurant charged us $37.95, consider a live crab from supermarket is $4 a lb, they are charging 6x market price, but the decoration and ambience of this place is that high-end. The Shaken beef has pretty good flavor, but with $21.95, similar dish from R&G lounge will come double the portion, and R&G lounge is considered high-end and expensive. The Garlic noodle is very so so, the noodle itself was overcooked and kind of sticky. All in all, this is an overpriced restaurant with slightly above average food.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-02-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Anyway, our party also ordered the tamarind crab, asparagus soup, shrimp toast and either the Saigon beef or the shaken beef, I can't remember.

I did not want to be rude so I said, it's alright, it's ok.  I was still nice to her.

Where do they even keep that many crabs laying around I thought.  At that point, I wasn't sure if he mentioned it already, so to save some possible embarrassment I didn't inquire about the crabs, nodded, and just asked...'where are the restrooms?' \n\nParking was more difficult than I expected as street parking sucked that day.  My laziness within grew with valet parking available tempting me.  The outrageous cost of $12 bucks and the thought of someone joy riding in my valuable antique of a Corolla didn't sit well with me.  The Sunset weather by the water was its usual half dreary self.  Contrast to the outside, inside the restaurant was vibrant and warm.  Aroma of good times filled the place; passing each table we saw at least one crab on the table.  Hold those horses...part of the waiter's yada yada yada included \"90% of people order the crab\".  \n\nIf it were me, our order would have consisted of all crab and garlic noodles.  Due to food allergies and cholesterol consciousness at the table, a full spectrum of dishes was chosen.  \n\nOUR ORDER:     \n*Lemongrass chicken satay - These grilled chicken skewers come numbering around three or four.  This was the first item that came out and everyone was hungry.  Playing the disappearing act in a poof, I only ate a sliver of a sliver sized piece.  My taste buds do not recall anything negative.  There were no complaints either.  \n\n*Salt & pepper calamari - One of my sister's go to dishes no matter where, when, and how.  How can you go wrong with deep fried calamari?  You can't; unless they were soggy which these were not.  Salt and pepper were abundantly prevalent throughout.  The chunks of calamari were a larger size calamari than usual.  Bigger means more calamari meat and less batter.  Less batter is typically good thing.  \n\n*Shaken beef - Shaken, not stirred...I didn't taste the \"shaken\", but the cubes of meat were very tender.  Served on a bed of green and mixed in with some potato, the meat has a sharp peppery taste.  I recommend this for people with seafood allergies that come here.    \n  \n*Lemongrass chicken - Didn't I order something with lemongrass as an appetizer already?  I repeated \"lemongrass\" a couple times under my breath unsure of this when ordering.  We needed another dish for the non-seafood eaters at the table anyway.  Consisting of probably all dark meat, the chicken was very simplistically lemongrass-ed.  There were more bell peppers than I would have liked.  The noticeable echo of pepper flavor popped up again.  I wonder how much pepper this restaurant uses in a day.   \n\n*\"Colossal\" royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles - My main chagrin about this plate was the adjective \"colossal\" attached to the prawns.  All the pictures I saw, they looked humongous.  I bet the picture I took even look gigantic.  Truly, it is an optical illusion.  While unexpectedly smaller they were also a smidgen on the salty side for me.  Overdosed on seasoning, the prawns sat on top of garlic noodles.  The spillover of seasoning into the garlic noodles unassumingly enhanced the noodles.  The garlic noodles are good by themselves; the extra touch of seasoning really made the whole that much better.  If I go again, I'll pass on this one, but was decent. \n\n*Roast crab - Presentation is absolutely photogenic.  I'm talking about super model level.  The crab was very meaty and a nice size.  They really saved the best for last, as this was the last entr\u00e9e to be served.  Cut down the middle with all the legs intact, the shell of the crab is ornamentally placed on top of the legs.  Their \"garlic sauce and secret sauce\" fully cooked into the crab meat and needless to say, I started to dip some noodles in the dressing.  It was good stuff.  To nitpick, freshness rating of the crab wasn't A+, rather an A-.    \n \n*Steamed rice - That's how my dad rolls.  Can't go anywhere without it.  I had to add this one or it wouldn't be a complete review.  The white rice came in a bowl and tasted...rice-like.  My dad thoroughly enjoyed it with a big smile.\n\nThanh Long is an Americanized Vietnamese restaurant that is versatile enough to draw even the most Asian of Asians.  If you read the articles down the hallway to the restroom, there's a feel good story behind restaurant's owners (Remember that question about where the restrooms were?  Yeah...there was a line and I had some time to read.).  The main attraction is their crab and garlic noodles.

Customer service was pretty on point, the waiter was friendly and attentive. He memorized our order (which was quite a few items) without writing it down, but sadly forgot one of the appetizers. All good, since I'm sure we over ordered anyways.\n\nOur dinner consisted of one of each of the soups, salt and pepper calamari, collasal tiger prawns over garlic noodles, lemongrass chicken, vegetarian entree, chicken fried rice, and an extra order of garlic noodles. Although the serving size wasn't as big as we had pictured, this was more than enough for the 5 of us, so in retrospect, the serving size was pretty decent.\n\nOut of all the soups, we all voted that the vegetarian soup was the best. Something about the clear broth and the assorted veggies just made it more refreshing versus the creamy aspargus chowder or the chicken vermecelli soup.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari was good as well, served sizzling hot, with a good combination of salt AND pepper, but for a couple of the outlying pieces, there was definitely a lot more salt than pepper. \n\nAs for the entrees, it was pretty mediocre, not fabulous, but not disgusting or unedible. There was just nothing outstanding about the meal. The main dish I liked the most was the collasal tigerl prawns over garlic noodles.

Salt & Pepper Calamari - delicious except for the simple overdose of coarsely ground black pepper; will definitely tell them next time to adjust the black pepper with a lighter touch\n\n2. Mango Salad - fresh mango fruit sauteed with bell peppers, seared scallops & shrimp over mixed greens in a raspberry vinaigrette - this would make for an excellent  meal on it's own; the raspberry vinaigrette nicely tied the various flavors together effortlessly\n\n3. Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant - eggplant sauteed with jumbo prawns, chicken, fresh basil, baby corn, shitake mushrooms, & red chilies in a tamarind & chili-soya; I like spicy but it was on the low end of the spicy spectrum on this dinner outing though the overall flavors were good ~ will order it again but tell the server to make it spicier\n\n4. Villager's Favorite - Pacific prawns & pork medallions simmered in a caramelized reduction of soy and herbs; I liked this dish enough that I would order it again; a nice take on a \"surf and turf\" with pork instead of beef for the \"turf\" portion\n\n5. Shaken Beef - tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes; delicious in flavor with fork tender beef; the greens I could do without as it seemed more a \"salad\" than an entree\n\n6. Vegetarian Delight - silken tofu sauteed with asst. vegetables & shitake mushrooms; a standout as I love tofu and veggies!\n\n7. Roast Crab - a whole Dungeness crab roasted with An's garlic sauce & secret spices in the Secret Kitchen; regardless of what others may say, this in of itself is a delectable Dungeness crab entree!  Yes it's messy but who cares?  The flavors marry very well and our entire party enjoyed this dish.\n\n8. Garlic Noodles - An's famous noodles made with their secret garlic sauce (perhaps the one used on the Roast Crab?) & secret spices; this noodle dish is good when hot but at room temperature or worse, cold, it's not that good (something coagulates on the noodles when it's cold...butter perhaps?)\n\nDespite the large amounts ordered per item, we had lots of left overs (crab included) for our party of 18.  Would I go back to this spot?  You betcha!  I want to try the Tamarind Crab - \"simmered in a melange of Roma tomatoes & tamarind, seasoned with fresh dill & green onions & flambeed with cognac.\"  The ingredients for this dish make me salivate just thinking about it.\n\nThere is a full bar in case you want a drink while you wait and/or with your meal.  Two of us ordered the Fleur de Mango - pureed fresh mango, Malibu rum, a banana rum and freshly squeezed orange juice to the mix - this was the fave drink of the evening!  \n \nWhile parking is an issue, it's located in a neighborhood folks, get there early so that you can look for parking or just valet your car.  I would also suggest booking a reservation so that you are amongst the first seating for the evening.  Overall, the service was excellent/attentive and the food was delicious.\n\nThe name of this restaurant came about due to an error at the printer's.

Obviously it's not some Michelin star restaurant where the waitstaff is over the top, but everyone was very pleasant. Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were cleared promptly, and they made sure we had everything we needed.

Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order.

They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the Garlic Noodles, Mango Salad, and Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns that came out to be about $70 dollars total (omfg).

My boyfriend succinctly describes the noodles as \"starchy with a bite and not oily at all.\"   \n\nAlthough we were pleased with the quality of the food, the atmosphere did not live up to the price of the check.

As a matter of fact, the back of my chair was touching the chair of the person who sat with his back to me. We concluded that we rather pay a bit more at Crustacean for nicer ambiance.\n\nAll in all, reservation is highly recommended if you do not want to wait.

Once we were seated, we noticed the full bar and decided to order a couple of drinks to start off our night. I ordered the fleur de mango and the boyfriend ordered the Hanoi sunset (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=5AnN3N7w7JTwsWHvz8rcug). The fleur de mango was really good. The rum flavor was subtle and masked by the freshly blended orange juice and sweet mango puree. I had a sip of the Hanoi sunset and it tasted ridiculously strong. It tasted as though I was sipping on a straight shot of alcohol. My boyfriend shared the same feelings--he had to force himself to chug down the alcohol laden martini.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the chicken satay (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=XH78FALuoyCY-PemWsm18g) and salmon carpaccio (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=g2SQ3ayDT3W9Fm9seQQEVw). The chicken satay was pretty disappointing--three skewers of grilled chicken came out on a plate with no dipping sauce. The chicken was a little on the dry side and it tasted really bland. Usually when I eat chicken satay, it is always served with a side of satay peanut sauce for dipping. Oh well, the tasty salmon carpaccio made up for the disappointment. I love refreshing dishes like the salmon carpaccio, as the flavors of the simple ingredients are truly highlighted. The buttered-bread, capers, and lightly lemon-marinated salmon all combined deliciously.\n\nAnd of course, for our entrees, we shared one roast crab and an order of garlic noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=1bMAC3tQqYuN0JkIZRKVqQ). To be perfectly honest, I wasn't that impressed with the roast crab. It was definitely juicy, meaty, and big, but the flavors weren't that great. It definitely didn't live up to all the hype. On the other hand, the garlic noodles were to-die-for! I'm a huge fan of garlic and the garlic noodles were sooo soft and garlicky. I've tried garlic noodles once before and the garlic flavor wasn't as distinct as the garlic flavor in Thanh Long's garlic noodles. I give their garlic noodles 5 stars!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had an overall good experience. We enjoyed the intimate, but comfortable ambiance. The customer service was excellent and extremely attentive. I'll probably try the colossal royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles next time.\n\nP.S.\nCheers to my 100th review! :D", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-06-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Other noteworthy dishes I've tried and loved: Shrimp Toast, Shaken Beef, and Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns. \n\n"], "author": "Judy C.", "review": "My all-time favorite San Francisco restaurant is situated right here in Outer Sunset.

Yummy yum yum. As for my order, I'd have to say that the 'Colossal' in the menu name might be a little misleading- they are Jumbo prawns at best. The prawns are splayed open when served, but if you put them back together (like I did) just to gauge their actual size: I'd say they were Jumbo, not Colossal. Size aside, the meat was tender and moist. So, so good.\n\nSide comment on valet parking:\nNot sure where exactly they took the car once we handed over the keys, but we ended up waiting like fifteen minutes with no line when we were leaving. Seriously- we made a quick trip across the street to the liquor store because they were taking so damn long. Really makes me question where they take the cars.

The soup was clean tasting and good, the chicken was tender but I would've liked the noodles to have been the more traditional pho noodles rather than clear ones.\n\nLARGE PLATES\n\nShaken Beef - Tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes. I'm not a beef person but this seemed good as well. Ours didn't come with potatoes though, but with onions.\n\nLemongrass Chicken - Slices of chicken sauteed with seasonal vegetables, garlic & chili. Pretty impressed by this one! Would order again for sure.\n\nSECRET KITCHEN DISHES \n\nRoast Crab - A whole Dungeness crab roasted with An's garlic sauce & secret spices.\n\nGarlic Noodles - An's famous noodles made with our special garlic sauce & secret spices. Super flavorful and very memorable. \n\nDESSERT \n\nFried banana a la mode - With vanilla ice cream. For $8, the portions for the fried banana was tiny! The vanilla ice cream was way too frozen when served to us. There also was way too much whipped cream.\n\nFor the price point I would expect Thanh Long to be a more classy and upscale looking restaurant. It was great overall, but a bit on the pricier side for me.

It has a presence that feels like it stuck to it's guns and succeeded in becoming a permanent fixture in the Sunset neighborhood. There is an old school but upscale charm with Thanh Long which reminds of what people refer to as the \"Golden Age\" of dining. Much of the ornamentation is Vietnamese inspired, from the Lotus petal pendant lights, to the large dragon mural hanging from the wall, and who can forget the stereotypical dark red furniture. Overall, the antiquated atmosphere of Thanh Long compliments the cuisine well. \n\nEven though Thanh Long is a Vietnamese restaurant, the dishes we ordered did not have that signature Vietnamese flavor. Instead, the dishes are simple, straight forward, and served fast. For example, the Roast Crab is literally roasted crab with butter, salt, and pepper. In my opinion, creating a simple good tasting dish is much more difficult as their is more room for error and judgment. What Thanh Long does well is make these seemingly simple dishes taste amazing. \n\nThanh Long is a bit on the pricey side as you'll probably need to order one Roast Crab per person.

They aren't overwhelming, but they are quick to refill your water, and they're always walking around, that way if you need something they're easily accessible.  Everyone is quick, friendly, Americanized (no racial) and professional.\n\nThe food is astounding!  We start off with ordering the Salt & Pepper Calamari, sounds plain, but it's the most flavorful calamari ever.  My boyfriend and I always share 1 crab because they are HUGE with lots of meat.  There are different flavors of crab but our favorite is the Roast Crab.  We've tried the others but Roast Crab is my all-time favorite.

She asked me if I wanted to take a one day trip to San Francisco.  \"Heck yea!\", I told her.  I haven't been to SF in years.  Now, I had my heart set on going to House of Prime Rib but they were booked a month in advance.  But, I had remembered seeing Thanh Long featured on either the Travel or Food Channel weeks beforehand so I tried booking a reservation online.  Sadly, there was nothing available so I called the restaurant and got a reservation!\n\nI viewed the menu online and browsed through the photos on Yelp beforehand.  I knew I wanted to order the Thanh Long Mussels and An's Famous Garlic Noodles.  I was up in the air on the Dungeness Crab because I knew it would be rather pricey.\n\nWe arrived at 5:30 that night and was promptly seated to our table.  We looked around and noticed that every table was having the crab so we asked our server what the market price was ($53.95 as of October 8th).  We figured we would not be back to SF for awhile so we ended up ordering Tempura Style Coconut Prawns, Thanh Long Mussels, the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles.  The Prawns were ok.  Nothing that blew me away.  The Mussels; however,  were delicious.  I would definitely order that again for an appetizer.  The Roast Crab...O M G!  That was the BEST crab I have ever had!  I'm not really too sure what all the spices they use but it was heaven.  The crab meat was so tender and flavorful.  And the Garlic Noodles may not look like much when it arrives to your table, but once you take a bite you will not be able to stop slurping those noodles.  Mix it with the sauce from the crab and it tastes even better!  \n\nThe service here is top notch!  They kept checking back with us to see how everything was and constantly refilled our drinks (soda and iced tea).  I would definitely recommend and come back here for dinner.

Is it a cake? Is it served with ice cream? Or are you just going to charge me $15 for some fucking fruit?!?!?! So I said forget it, and asked for the check.\n\n4.

Scrumptious. \n3) 2 orders of garlic noodles- the best you'll find anymore. I love that the garlic flavor is present but not overpowering, and balances the flavor of the butter.

"], "author": "Kevin L.", "review": "I think the last time I was here was 6 years ago.  And this was probably the first \"fancy\" restaurant I went to back in high school.  And the first time for garlic noodles that was so WOW to me back then.  20 years later and many many new culinary experiences, the garlic noodles ain't no big thang.\n\nYou come here for the roast crab and garlic noodles, yes but I wanted to try something new.  So in addition, I got the mango salad and seafood dumpling.  And also the steamed sea bass entree.\n\nRoast crab was just ok.  I prefer PPQ and the salt & pepper fried crab at R&G more.  Thanh Long's crab was flavorful but over peppered and garlic oiled at times.  The weak part was the tamale in the shell.  It seemed like it was cleaned out a bit and the crab wasn't as big as it usually is.  Maybe its not so in season now but they should still be reserving colossal size crabs for their dishes.  We had the prawns with garlic noodles.  The prawns very overdone a bit and had too much buttery/pepper smeared over it.  It was cholesterol city last night.\n\nMango salad too my surprise had stir fried shrimp and onions on top making the salad a bit warm and welted.\n\nSeafood dumpling seem like it was heated in the microwave and had a dry appearance.\n\nBoth salad and dumpling came out super fast.\n\nSea bass was over done too and just wasn't as smooth as it should be.  Sea bass ain't suppose to taste \"meaty\".  I think a filet-o-fish has an even more delicate flaky texture.  I would rather had two filet-o-fish sandwiches on that big plate instead of the sea bass.\n\nNo plate presentation on anything.\n\nOrdered a pineapple lychee martini before ordering food but it never came and the food did.  I had to ask and then they said they were all out of the infusion?  So I tried a passion tea martini which came after the entrees.  So it sat there getting warm as I started to eat and didn't feel like drinking it anymore.  It was nice when it was straight cold.  \n\nServer who took our order never came back to ask what's up with the food.  Instead the runner asked?  Pretty whack on service.\n\n$41.95 for the crab is totally not worth it.  I would pay 20 bucks at most.  In fact, I can make this at home and I do every time crab season starts.  Go to sunset supermarket or new may wah and get some live crabs and cook it up at home.  I could of cooked a bunch of crab for the money I spent here.\n\nAll good, it was my birthday and didn't want to cook at home and Thanh Long is about 4 minutes from my home.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the shaken beef, roast crab and garlic noodles.

And not with nasty, melted-down ice! Your bowls for shells and other unwanted will never be filled for they replace it very often. I was extremely satisfied.\n\nOthers/Description of the place: IT WAS HELL ON EARTH trying to find parking (not that you should resort to shady valet service unless you're really on a time crunch). I also had trouble locating which building is Thanh Long. This place for sure did not stand out to me. It was nothing special from the exterior. So I was very pleased to see just how beautiful and classy the inside of the restaurant was. They have a full bar in the front when you first walk in. And a second story for their customers. Lighting in here is quite dim which I love. It helps to create a much more intimate atmosphere. We celebrated a friend's birthday here so we dressed to impress. But it wouldn't be totally inappropriate to show up casual. I just wouldn't suggest walking up in there with like beach wears or something. \n\nTips: They DO take reservations so be sure to take advantage of that and do so. It'll save yourself a lot of time and pain waiting in line, anticipating their delicious food. And if you do have reservation, be sure to arrive early. It took me about 15-20 minutes to drive EVERYWHERE  around the neighborhood, circling the block several times before finding a parking spot. NOT just a decent parking spot, just any parking spot AT ALL. It was ridiculous. The point is, don't be late for your reservation. Not only that, but make sure your whole party is on time. Not just a few of you because that wouldn't count. And no, calling them to let them know you're on your way will not help. They may stretch it by 5 minutes, but that's about it. So to my ladies and drag queens, if you're going to wear high heels...you're about to have SOOOOO much fun walking a couple of blocks to destination. Just sayin'. \n\nBe prepared.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-12"}, {"excerpts": ["*Roast crab - Presentation is absolutely photogenic.  ", "I'm talking about super model level.

My mind wondered, 'are cokes refillable?'...'where are the restrooms?'...'how much is 'market price'?'...'does the waiter know I'm not really paying attention?'\n\nBack to reality...'did he say 500 hundred crabs?'  Where do they even keep that many crabs laying around I thought.  At that point, I wasn't sure if he mentioned it already, so to save some possible embarrassment I didn't inquire about the crabs, nodded, and just asked...'where are the restrooms?' \n\nParking was more difficult than I expected as street parking sucked that day.  My laziness within grew with valet parking available tempting me.  The outrageous cost of $12 bucks and the thought of someone joy riding in my valuable antique of a Corolla didn't sit well with me.  The Sunset weather by the water was its usual half dreary self.  Contrast to the outside, inside the restaurant was vibrant and warm.  Aroma of good times filled the place; passing each table we saw at least one crab on the table.  Hold those horses...part of the waiter's yada yada yada included \"90% of people order the crab\".  \n\nIf it were me, our order would have consisted of all crab and garlic noodles.  Due to food allergies and cholesterol consciousness at the table, a full spectrum of dishes was chosen.  \n\nOUR ORDER:     \n*Lemongrass chicken satay - These grilled chicken skewers come numbering around three or four.  This was the first item that came out and everyone was hungry.  Playing the disappearing act in a poof, I only ate a sliver of a sliver sized piece.  My taste buds do not recall anything negative.  There were no complaints either.  \n\n*Salt & pepper calamari - One of my sister's go to dishes no matter where, when, and how.  How can you go wrong with deep fried calamari?  You can't; unless they were soggy which these were not.  Salt and pepper were abundantly prevalent throughout.  The chunks of calamari were a larger size calamari than usual.  Bigger means more calamari meat and less batter.  Less batter is typically good thing.  \n\n*Shaken beef - Shaken, not stirred...I didn't taste the \"shaken\", but the cubes of meat were very tender.  Served on a bed of green and mixed in with some potato, the meat has a sharp peppery taste.  I recommend this for people with seafood allergies that come here.    \n  \n*Lemongrass chicken - Didn't I order something with lemongrass as an appetizer already?  I repeated \"lemongrass\" a couple times under my breath unsure of this when ordering.  We needed another dish for the non-seafood eaters at the table anyway.  Consisting of probably all dark meat, the chicken was very simplistically lemongrass-ed.  There were more bell peppers than I would have liked.  The noticeable echo of pepper flavor popped up again.  I wonder how much pepper this restaurant uses in a day.   \n\n*\"Colossal\" royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles - My main chagrin about this plate was the adjective \"colossal\" attached to the prawns.  All the pictures I saw, they looked humongous.  I bet the picture I took even look gigantic.  Truly, it is an optical illusion.  While unexpectedly smaller they were also a smidgen on the salty side for me.  Overdosed on seasoning, the prawns sat on top of garlic noodles.  The spillover of seasoning into the garlic noodles unassumingly enhanced the noodles.  The garlic noodles are good by themselves; the extra touch of seasoning really made the whole that much better.  If I go again, I'll pass on this one, but was decent. \n\n*Roast crab - Presentation is absolutely photogenic.  I'm talking about super model level.  The crab was very meaty and a nice size.  They really saved the best for last, as this was the last entr\u00e9e to be served.  Cut down the middle with all the legs intact, the shell of the crab is ornamentally placed on top of the legs.  Their \"garlic sauce and secret sauce\" fully cooked into the crab meat and needless to say, I started to dip some noodles in the dressing.  It was good stuff.  To nitpick, freshness rating of the crab wasn't A+, rather an A-.    \n \n*Steamed rice - That's how my dad rolls.  Can't go anywhere without it.  I had to add this one or it wouldn't be a complete review.  The white rice came in a bowl and tasted...rice-like.  My dad thoroughly enjoyed it with a big smile.\n\nThanh Long is an Americanized Vietnamese restaurant that is versatile enough to draw even the most Asian of Asians.  If you read the articles down the hallway to the restroom, there's a feel good story behind restaurant's owners (Remember that question about where the restrooms were?

It's also tossed with some veggies, which our family also happily munched on.  Not the best calamari we've ever had but also not the worst.  The crab puffs were ordered on our waiter's suggestion and they were good, too - soft on the inside with the outside perfectly golden and crunchy.

We are a family of five - this, plus the two appetizers, were not enough for us (we went for ice cream after).  The garlic noodles (~$10 an order) were delicious but, seriously, tasted very similar to Red Crawfish's garlic noodles (a.k.a., if you want a delicious, but in a more casual setting, similar meal, perhaps think of RC as an alternative).  The Roast Crab was delicious and our family destroyed it within about 15 minutes.  Seriously do not remember the exact taste because we were inhaling our food.

Once we were seated, we noticed the full bar and decided to order a couple of drinks to start off our night. I ordered the fleur de mango and the boyfriend ordered the Hanoi sunset (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=5AnN3N7w7JTwsWHvz8rcug). The fleur de mango was really good. The rum flavor was subtle and masked by the freshly blended orange juice and sweet mango puree. I had a sip of the Hanoi sunset and it tasted ridiculously strong. It tasted as though I was sipping on a straight shot of alcohol. My boyfriend shared the same feelings--he had to force himself to chug down the alcohol laden martini.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the chicken satay (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=XH78FALuoyCY-PemWsm18g) and salmon carpaccio (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=g2SQ3ayDT3W9Fm9seQQEVw). The chicken satay was pretty disappointing--three skewers of grilled chicken came out on a plate with no dipping sauce. The chicken was a little on the dry side and it tasted really bland. Usually when I eat chicken satay, it is always served with a side of satay peanut sauce for dipping. Oh well, the tasty salmon carpaccio made up for the disappointment. I love refreshing dishes like the salmon carpaccio, as the flavors of the simple ingredients are truly highlighted. The buttered-bread, capers, and lightly lemon-marinated salmon all combined deliciously.\n\nAnd of course, for our entrees, we shared one roast crab and an order of garlic noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=1bMAC3tQqYuN0JkIZRKVqQ). To be perfectly honest, I wasn't that impressed with the roast crab. It was definitely juicy, meaty, and big, but the flavors weren't that great. It definitely didn't live up to all the hype. On the other hand, the garlic noodles were to-die-for! I'm a huge fan of garlic and the garlic noodles were sooo soft and garlicky.

"], "author": "Gene C.", "review": "I came here with a friend from out of town looking for a competitor to PPQ Dungeness Island. The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.

But the mediocre, overpriced food at Thanh Long has beat out my laziness.\n\nI used to eat at Thanh Long as a child and absolutely LOVED it. We had reservations for 4 for my brother's birthday dinner two nights ago, and needless to say, I will NEVER return! The food was comparable to a buffet in Reno. \n\nGarlic Noodles were lacking. It didn't taste anything of fresh garlic. Instead, the noodles were soggy and overcooked, with the flavor of garlic salt.\n\nMango salad was probably the only tolerable dish we had that night. The vinaigrette was light and sweet, but the portion was pretty small.\n\nThe shaken beef was a huge disappointment. The entire bottom of the plate was covered in chopped romaine lettuce, but was hidden under beef, giving the impression that the plate was full of beef. In addition, there were ample chopped potatoes sauteed to LOOK like beef. There were maybe a total of 9 piece of actual beef on the plate, for about $20-$25. \n\nThe sea bass was absolutely bland. It was cooked with no seasoning, AT ALL. The saving grace for this dish was the accompanying sauce on the side, which had a slight sweet, citrus flavor to it. For $25, the serving of sea bass is smaller than the average portion for one person. There was ONE bok choy cut into thirds on the side of this dish. I'm pretty sure bok choy i s$0.79/lb at the supermarket. If you're gonna skimp on the portion of the fish, you could at least use more than one bok choy.\n\nThanh Long has always had a special place in my heart for their crab. No more. The roast crab we ordered came out lukewarm. This would've been tolerable had the crab actually had flavor. It looked like it was covered in black pepper, but had no taste at all = pre-ground black pepper. I RARELY use salt to cook, and my usual complaint when I eat out is that the food is too salty.

Mango Salad - fresh mango fruit sauteed with bell peppers, seared scallops & shrimp over mixed greens in a raspberry vinaigrette - this would make for an excellent  meal on it's own; the raspberry vinaigrette nicely tied the various flavors together effortlessly\n\n3. Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant - eggplant sauteed with jumbo prawns, chicken, fresh basil, baby corn, shitake mushrooms, & red chilies in a tamarind & chili-soya; I like spicy but it was on the low end of the spicy spectrum on this dinner outing though the overall flavors were good ~ will order it again but tell the server to make it spicier\n\n4.

Shaken Beef - tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes; delicious in flavor with fork tender beef; the greens I could do without as it seemed more a \"salad\" than an entree\n\n6.

My pareng Jimmy kept telling me about this place called Thanh Long that had amazing crabs that were decked out in a nice garlic pepper sauce.  I've heard about this place for months now.  Being from San Diego, it took awhile to try it but it was definitely worth the wait.\n\nThe place seems like a hole in the wall from the outside.  The location isn't the prettiest in the world so it made me kind of skeptical of the place.  I walked in and saw a BUSY environment filled with people waiting at the door step.  We had reservations so we got seated fairly quickly.  \n\nThere's a full menu of things to order but we went simple and went straight for the crab.  At first we decided to go with some appetizers so we started off with the cheese wontons.  They're decent.  I'm not sure I'd recommend getting them.  I'd probably say just wait for the main course.  The crabs are HUGE.  We were a party of 7 so we decided to order 4 king crabs and some garlic noodles to accompany the crabs.  We went simple with our order.  We ordered two of the drunken crabs and two of the \"roast' ones that featured a nice peppered garlic sauce on it.\n\nWe got our order after about 15 minutes.  Not too shabby.  Good food takes awhile so I wasn't really concerned with the timing.  I took one bite of the roast crab.  WOW.  The peppered garlic sauce is AMAZING.  I don't think I've ever tried crab THAT GOOD.  I broke off a couple of legs and began digging in.  I dipped the crab meat into the garlic sauce and felt heaven after each bite.  What makes things even better was the garlic noodles.  They're SO GOOD.  I think I had like two plates of the garlic noodles to myself!  I ate so much food.  There's also a bunch of crab fat in the head.  Just writing this review is getting me hungry.  Unfortunately, I'm back in San Diego!!!\n\nI also tried the drunken crab.  It's alright.  I don't think I would order it again though.  I think my next trip would consist of roast crab, garlic noodles, and sapporo beer.  Keep it simple.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and EVERYONE.  \n\nIf you are in the LA area, I believe the owner of Thanh Long also owns CRUSTACEAN.  I think it's a upper scale version of Thanh Long.

The vegetable of the day was sauteed green beans, also great, and the salt&pepper calamari, which was just okay. Oh, and lychee vodka! The only drawback is that the crab was about $42 each... otherwise I would have gladly eaten another two. Or four. Or ten.

It's also very loud and chaotic.  Feels more like a neighborhood eating joint with the cramped tables and noisy atmosphere.  \n\nThe service was kinda lacking.

It was still good but right off the bat I noticed mine was room temperature.  Unlike Crustaceans at Thanh Long the crab comes out of the kitchen in record time.   All night servers came out literally by the second, with the roast crab.  With as fast as they were bringing it out, it's easy to assume they were cooked before you ordered it. \n\nThe garlic noodles were great though, not overly greasy and great garlic flavor and portion.  I also liked their shrimp toast, as an appetizer but the calamari was forgettable.  \n\nThe main disappointment was in their dessert selection.  I was undecided and the waitress suggested I try the fried banana, which of course every other Asian restaurant offers.  At Thanh Long was probably the worst (and I've never had a fried banana I didn't like).  The banana- to-dough ratio was waaayyy off.  Too much dough.  I ate more of the ice cream because I could barely eat two bites of the fried banana.  \n\nNow that I've tried it there, I won't be going back.

It just felt wrong to wear a bib and indulge in garlic noodles right down the street from Rodeo Dr. \n\nWhen I was a young'un and didn't like crab (we all grow up some time), I would get the chicken curry here and that is also delicious. Now, when I go with a group, we tend to order the Garlic Roast Crab, Garlic Noodles, Fried Rice, Daily Vegetable, and maybe some calamari or something little to start.

The waiters were really friendly but not to the point that you're annoyed of them.  The wait for the food was pretty decent, about 30-40 minutes.  Also before the meal they put on a bib for us and after they gave us nice and warm towels to clean up our hands and faces from eating the crabs like the savages we were.  \n\nThe restaurant is fairly small and it gets pretty busy here sometimes so it's best to make a reservation before you come.  And parking anywhere in San Francisco sucks, but there's valet parking right next to the restaurant and it's pretty cheap, around 5 bucks or so.  However, my car reeked of the smell of cigarettes when it was returned, so that was unfortunate, but that isn't the restaurant's fault.

This dish was delicious.\nSteamed Sea Bass ($24.95) - sea bass was flaky, moist, and really good.

Parents didn't like it so much, but I thought it was okay.\nShaken Beef ($20.95) - very flavorful, and a dish that everyone loved.

The Parents are notoriously picky about food and the Dad is particularly so when it comes to crab. It has to be fresh, can't be over-seasoned and has to be meaty. Thank goodness for Thanh Long. We ordered the mango salad, Dungeness crab puffs, ginger calamari, Drunken Crab, Roast Crab and the garlic rice. The Boyfriend and I had heard that people loved the garlic noodles but the Parents didn't like the looks of it so the Boyfriend and I again followed the advice of our friend and ordered some garlic rice. In terms of food, Thanh Long gets five stars. The Parents loved the food. The ginger calamari was well-seasoned, not too gingery and not too salty. It was particularly yummy with the pineapples. The mango salad was delicious (it has shrimp and scallops as well) and the garlic rice was flavorful without being overpowering. The Dungeness crab puffs were a big hit but pricey. It was basically a tastier version of crab rangoon. Now for the crab: right before ordering, the Boyfriend and I faithfully checked Yelp and some had said that the Roast Crab was too salty. The Dad isn't too fond of wine-reduction so we tried the Roast Crab first. It was delicious and not too salty at all. The waiter comes over with plastic bibs and you get to cracking (well...the Boyfriend and the Dad got to cracking and then fed the Mom and me bits and pieces). One crab is about enough for one person to be full. One crab is about enough to make two grown men half-full so calculate accordingly.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this place in my own backyard. I wasn't expecting this restaurant to be in the suburbs in the outer sunset. Parking was terrible so my friends and I opted for  valet. I think it was $10. We ordered the soft shell crab and salt and pepper calamari for appetizers and  the roast  crab and garlic noodles for the entree. The soft shell crab was very good. They give you one small deep fried soft shell crab with sweet & sour dipping sauce. The salt & pepper calamari was decent. I thought it was a little too salty for my taste. It left me wanting to take a sip of H2O every time I took a bite. The roast crab was DELICIOUS!! It was really good. I didn't enjoy it as much when the crab became cold. It's served in a puddle of butter that started to congeal at the end of the meal. It wasn't a pretty site. I felt like my arteries were clogging instantly.

Although I've downgraded my review for both R&G and PPQ because of horrible service at our follow-up visits, as far as taste goes, in my opinion Thanh Long is at the bottom of the three.\n\nOn Sunday, 7.24.11, my friends and I came to Thanh Long for our quarterly crab dinner. It was my first time and my friends' third time here. We had reservations for 5:30 PM which I made several days prior. Thanh Long place gets packed, so reservations are highly recommended. Upon arrival we were promptly seated. \n\nAs most Yelpers have mentioned, you can forget about looking at the menu because there are only TWO THINGS to order at Thanh Long: THE CRAB and the GARLIC NOODLES! And given the rave reviews and hype, I didn't care to order anything else. \n\nF O O D\nFor a party of three we ordered:\n\n*ROASTED CRAB w/ An's Garlic Sauce & Spices (~$38) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=JuuVdF8Q2UIeOFAYHPHX8Q\nUpon first glance, I was wondering where all the garlic was. The garlic \"sauce\" was more of oil infused with garlic and black pepper. Though fragrant, the garlic flavor wasn't anywhere as pronounced as PPQ's Roasted Crab and the sauce was merely oil which left a heavy feeling after dinner. The crab was fresh and perfectly roasted though which was evident in the sweet, tender, succulent meat. \n\n*DRUNKEN CRAB w/ Chardonnay, Sake, Brandy, Scallions & Black Pepper (~$38) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=ObzTM78quAF_QKol4BqGcA\nIf you're more of a crab purist (or an alcoholic) and like to taste it in its unadulterated form, then the Drunken Crab is the way to go. The meat was clean tasting and you can taste all its natural sweetness. It was lightly infused with the trio of alkies, though sake was the most prominent flavor giving it a subtle dry wine flavor.\n\n*GARLIC NOODLES w/ Special Garlic Sauce & Spices (2 orders @ $9.50/each) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=JUXoSeXnlJljPgzqmexqAg\nGarlic noodles and any solid noodle dish for that matter should be al-dente with a nice, chewy toothsome bite to it to show its freshness and proper execution. Though deliciously buttery and fragrant with lots of garlicky bits, Thanh Long's garlic noodles were choppy and mushy. \n\nPlease note: Thanh Long uses tons of MSG to flavor their food; enough to keep me waking up in the middle of night and running to the kitchen to get a glass of water to sooth my dry throat. \n\nS E R V I C E\nLet's just say the busboy was way more attentive than our waiter. The only thing our waiter did was take our order, bring our food and give us our bill; he never once checked on us. I wasn't surprised though as we have ran into the same service issues at R&G and PPQ and subpar service seems to be a reoccurring theme at many Asian restaurants. The only redeeming thing is our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering. \n\nA M BI AN C E / D E C O R\nA step above your typical Vietnamese restaurant, Thanh Long has crisp white linen tables and the waitstaff don purple mandarin collared attire. A fairly large restaurant, Thanh Long is a good option for large parties and family dinners. I noticed that a lot of people were on dates though it's very, very loud at Thanh Long.\n\nP A R K I N G\nAlthough I got lucky and found parking in less than 5 minutes across the street, I heard finding street parking can be very difficult in the area. Valet parking is available for $10. \n\nCompared to R&G (known for their Salt & Pepper Crab), R&G's crab has much more intense flavor with a spicy kick and the fried batter gives it a nice crispy texture contrast to the sweet, tender crab meat. PPQ's Roasted Crab is heavily covered in buttery garlic and each bite is like a garlic clove has exploded in your mouth which is different than Thanh Long's crab which is more subdued sitting in a wading pool of garlic infused oil and black pepper.\n\nSo, who reigns supreme? It all boils down to what flavors you're looking for. If want something deliciously salty and spicy with a crunch, R&G's Salt & Pepper is the King. However, if you want something sinfully rich with a strong BURST of garlicky flavor, than PPQ's Roasted Crab definitely trumps Thanh Long's.

I called on the Thursday before to make a reservation, made it for 5:30pm on Mother's Day. Perfect. They called on Saturday to confirm, awesome. They reminded me to make sure everyone was on time because we wouldn't be sat until our entire party was there. \n\nTypical of our family, one of my siblings was running late - therefore they wouldn't seat us. My Mom was mad and irritated because to her it didn't make sense because we knew what they wanted to order. After practically yelling at the hostess, they still didn't seat us - I was embarassed. The hostess remained calm and tried to explain to my Mom why they wouldn't seat us. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know why they won't sit full parties - it puts their entire reservation schedule off track - if two people of a seven party table is late, it extends their duration at the table once the two LATE people do get there, and causes the table who will be using that table next a delay, and so forth throughout the evening. \n\n30 minutes after our reservation time, my late sibling and her guest arrived, I kindly let the hostess know that we were finally all there, she told me that the only table available that sits 7 is currently paying and as soon as they leave, she'd be able to sit us - this was \"the best that she could do at this time.\" - I thanked her nicely and proceeded to apologize for my mom's reaction and that I understand why they couldn't seat us. \n\n5 minutes later - she came to me and said that she had another table available and we could be seated right away. While following her she told me that she appreciated my apology and to enjoy my meal. \n\nFood: \nDungeness Crab Puffs - delicious - a great appetizer for a larger group, there were 6 in one serving. \n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari - a little too much salt on this one, still good though!  Next time we'll try the Grilled Calamari \n\nShaken Beef - HOLY MOLEY DELICIOUS - Meat was SO tender and so flavorful - definitely recommend this. \n\nSiagon Beef - Not my favorite - the rest of my family like this but unfortunately this dish did NOT please my taste buds - I felt as though maybe the ingredients were way above my appreciation but it tasted too bitter for me. \n\nDrunken Crab - this was delicious - a whole crab, dunked in a secret sauce of Chardonney... \n\nRoasted Crab - this was EVEN better than the Drunken Crab - amazing. \n\nGarlic Noodles - MUST HAVE AT THE TABLE.

Top 5 for sure.  \n\nMy friend kept raving about this place and how great the garlic roast crab is.  I L-O-V-E crustaceans, crab legs and lobster tails rock my world.  Garlic not so much.  I of course use garlic in cooking to enhance a dish and can appreciate its use, but you're not gonna find me eating at The Stinking Rose where that shit reeks of almost raw garlic, ew.   So, I was slightly skeptical as to whether I'd enjoy this garlic crab, and the garlic noodles that you can order as a side dish.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant, and I'm pleasantly surprised to find out it doesn't have an overbearing garlic smell to it.  Awesome.  I was tempted to stray from convention and try the Tamarind crab, or the Drunken crab (cooked in white wine and olive oil I think), but everyone kept stressing how legit the garlic roast one was.  Ok, I caved.\n\nBoy, I've never been so happy to cave into peer pressure as I was Friday night.  The garlic roast crab was sooooooooo delicious, I went to town on that motha.  I kindof pride myself on my waspy crab-eating skills, I can pick every single morsel of meat out of a crab leg, which I did again that night.  Honestly it's a lot of crab meat so many of weaklings out there might want to follow in the footsteps of the couple next to us and \"split a crab.\"  I don't know what \"sharing\" or \"split\" a meal means as I've never done it myself, but I hear some people don't experience the food coma afterward, so I guess try it if you want.\n\nOn to the noodles, which again sounded super dicey to me.  I envisioned half-cooked garlic which would make me vomit.  Ohhhh silly girl, silly naive Jo.  No no no no- the garlic noodles were exquisite.  They tasted faintly of garlic, and like McDonald's fries, had to have a touch of sugar in them b/c they were slightly sweet and addictive as fuck.  Score.\n\nAs a sidenote, this place is a nicer restaurant, you still get a bib but it's definitely not a hole in the wall crab joint.  With that said, I wouldn't recommend it for a first or second date, b/c most girls will squirm at the thought of cracking crab legs (which might mess up our outfits, God forbid our date's crab gets flung inadvertently into our hair), and the garlic factor too, just don't do it.

So, this dish was good.\n\nI was less impressed by the drunken crab.  It was a little on the bland side.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, but the broth was kind of dull and watery.  It could have used a lot more flavor.  The crab was fresh, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nWe also got the shaken beef, which is beef marinaded in a sweet, salty sauce served with vegetables.  It was very tender.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The vegetables complimented the meat very well.  But, the fried potatoes were a bit weird.  I would get this dish again.\n\nThe other good thing here is the garlic noodles.  FYI, it tastes like it has some fish sauce or oyster sauce or crab broth in it.  So, if you are vegetarian beware.  The presentation is really poor.  They come out looking like very ordinary tan noodles.  But, the flavor is salty and sweet with a nice garlic flavor.  It is a bit more on the sweeter side than I expected.  But, it was very good.\n\nWe also had the boulliabaisse, the salmon carpaccio, the soft shell crabs, the mixed seasonal vegetables and the sea bass.  The soft shell crabs are a definite miss.  They lacked seasoning.  The batter was not that crispy.  It was a below average dish.\n\nThe boulliabaisse was a nice fish broth with vegetables floating in it and some rock shrimp that were cooked well.  It was ok.  Just think Tom Yum soup.  Nothing really special.\n\nThe salmon carpaccio was tasty.  The shallots added a nice contrast to the sweet salmon.  But, the portion was very small.\n\nThe mixed seasonal vegetables were well cooked, but ultimately they were just roasted vegetables.  Nothing special.\n\nFinally, the sea bass was a little overcooked.  The sauce was nice and mild.  It was ok.  But, nothing special.  It came with some vegetables in a light sauce.  \n\nI also had a mixed drink.  It was a bit on the sweet side.  FYI, the food here is not spicy, so fruity drinks do not pair well.  It is better to go with one of the dry white wines.  For a Vietnamese place, they don't use a lot of sour flavors, so the dry wine brings a little acidity to the food and makes the flavors come out.\n\nThe dessert menu was not very exciting.  Deep fried banana, chocolate molten cake.  All the standard stuff.  Nothing unusual or complicated.  We skipped it.\n\nThe service was typical for an Asian restaurant.  Not very attentive.  But, everyone was well dressed.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and surprisingly modern inside.  Outside, it looks like a dumpy Chinese restaurant in the Sunset.  But, there are some nice silks and figurines decorating the interior of the restaurant.  This is a good place for a special occasion meal or for a date although the clientele is a bit on the older side (mid to late 40s).  So, it is not exactly hip.  But, your date will appreciate the decor and the high quality food.\n\nA word about parking.  Come early.  Parking in the Sunset is horrible.  You might have to walk a few blocks.

What's with the bitter cabbage and 0 herbs?\n\n-Salt and NO pepper calamari, plain nasty\n\n-The drunken crab was such a disappointment; we did not pay $36 for a frozen crab \n\n-Service definitely needed improvement; when you put 100 lbs of salt in all your dishes, you should just give us a pitcher of water so we don't have to remind your servers about the water every 5 minutes\n\n-Water served in chipped/broken glasses\n\n-The tamarind crab and garlic noodles are good but the overall experience my friends and I had recently, DEFINITELY does not warrant the original 4 stars and another visit", "rating": 1, "date": "2007-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered the garlic noodles, garlic crab $42 drunken crab, fleur de mango, Vietnamese salad, coconut shrimp, and some soups.

One order is good for 3-4 ppl, but since I was with my two big brothers we ordered two. I wasn't as crazy for the noodles probably because all my attention went to the crabs. But as it is one of the signature dishes, you should try it. If you were on a budget and had to pick between rice and noodles though, I'd honestly say go with rice.\n\n33 beer is the perfect compliment to your crabs!\n\nLastly, we had the mussels and the calamari for appetizers. The calamari was lightly battered and really tasty. The mussels were exquisite!\n\nService was great. The waiters are always switching out the bowls for your empty shells. Also, at the end of your meal they give you hot towels for your hands, not to substitute you washing your hand but the hot towel helps with the crabby garlic smell on your hands.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

My pareng Jimmy kept telling me about this place called Thanh Long that had amazing crabs that were decked out in a nice garlic pepper sauce.  I've heard about this place for months now.  Being from San Diego, it took awhile to try it but it was definitely worth the wait.\n\nThe place seems like a hole in the wall from the outside.  The location isn't the prettiest in the world so it made me kind of skeptical of the place.  I walked in and saw a BUSY environment filled with people waiting at the door step.  We had reservations so we got seated fairly quickly.  \n\nThere's a full menu of things to order but we went simple and went straight for the crab.  At first we decided to go with some appetizers so we started off with the cheese wontons.  They're decent.  I'm not sure I'd recommend getting them.  I'd probably say just wait for the main course.  The crabs are HUGE.  We were a party of 7 so we decided to order 4 king crabs and some garlic noodles to accompany the crabs.  We went simple with our order.  We ordered two of the drunken crabs and two of the \"roast' ones that featured a nice peppered garlic sauce on it.\n\nWe got our order after about 15 minutes.  Not too shabby.  Good food takes awhile so I wasn't really concerned with the timing.  I took one bite of the roast crab.  WOW.  The peppered garlic sauce is AMAZING.  I don't think I've ever tried crab THAT GOOD.  I broke off a couple of legs and began digging in.  I dipped the crab meat into the garlic sauce and felt heaven after each bite.  What makes things even better was the garlic noodles.  They're SO GOOD.  I think I had like two plates of the garlic noodles to myself!  I ate so much food.  There's also a bunch of crab fat in the head.  Just writing this review is getting me hungry.  Unfortunately, I'm back in San Diego!!!\n\nI also tried the drunken crab.  It's alright.  I don't think I would order it again though.  I think my next trip would consist of roast crab, garlic noodles, and sapporo beer.  Keep it simple.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and EVERYONE.  \n\nIf you are in the LA area, I believe the owner of Thanh Long also owns CRUSTACEAN.  I think it's a upper scale version of Thanh Long.

I was addicted to the garlic noodles then.  I'd long heard about this legendary restaurant and just never made it out to 46th avenue until last evening. Thanh Long has a long and venerable history in San Francisco.   It almost pains me to write this review because I came away with my socks still firmly attached to my feet.  I was not blown away as others have been.  I was very sad about it, too.  I wanted to have my socks blown off.\n\nThe meal began with salt & pepper calamari and it was tasty.  The best thing we ate all evening.  The vietnamese salad was generous but lacked flavor.  It was essentially super fine shredded cabbage.  The prawns on top were boiled, tender and split.  \n\nI ordered the Tiger Prawns over garlic noodles.  The garlic noodles were a known aspect, so I knew what to expect, they were as garlicky as I remembered.  The 4 prawns were butterflied and grilled and were tasty.  For a market price item I thought the prawns were very spendy, just a few bucks under the price of a crab.  Ouch!  \n\nOne of my dinner companions ordered drunken crab and declared it yummy but not mind blowing.  We all tasted and commented, however, the crab was not fresh but frozen.  So that was a bit of a let down.  Yes, Dungeness are out of season locally but can be had fresh farther up the coast.  If I come back to try to famous roasted crab, I'll come back when it's in season.  \n\nMy overall thoughts are this was tasty, but, a plate of garlic noodles and 4 prawns and salad set me back $60 and I came away unsatisfied.  I wanted to be blown away, I'd heard the stories and I just was not super impressed.  \n\nThe service was fine, attentive and not overwhelming.  Water was refilled and bowls were replaced quickly.  The hot towels were great and a must.\n\nThe place was also incredibly noisy.  Obviously a celebration destination, be prepared to have trouble holding a conversation.

I remember the good old days when their crab was still under $20 a piece and before Valet parking was available. So there!\n\nNow about the food...Crab and Garlic Noodles are a MUST! Although they have a wide selection of food items on the menu, I can bet you a US $1 that every table you look around you would see people enjoying the Crab and Garlic Noodles. Okay, bets are off, I know there's always an exception to the rule...but I haven't personally witnessed a table that doesn't have the two things I mentioned above.\n\nAs for the Crab, you basically have 3 epicurean options (They are listed in the order of my likings - from top to bottom):\n\n1) Roasted Crab - lots of butter and cracked pepper cooked with their secret family recipe. It's Da Bomb!\n\n2) Drunken Crab - flavor is less intense than the roasted crab but it's still yummy.\n\n3) Crab in Tamarind Sauce - my least favorite of all (not because there's anything wrong with it, I just LOVE the Roasted Crab the best!)\n\nThen the Garlic Noodles...just YUMMY YUMMY! Though sometimes I just wanted to focus more on the CRAB and wanted to forego the garlic noodles...believe me, it's hard to do!\n\nI can usually finish one whole crab by myself (it's a good size crab by the way) and perhaps TWO on a good night...it's that GOOD!\n\nThe only drawback that I have personally experienced is that after eating the crab and the garlic noodles, I'll be too full to have desserts! Though, sometimes I'd go all out and ordered the Creme Brulee and some fancy tea (with Rose buds). It was a great way to end this wonderul dining experience. \n\nI forgot to mention that the few appetizers I have had there were all very good. The one that really stood out was their Salmon with Capers drizzled in Olive Oil served with toasted French bread slices.  Try it!

The salmon was sliced thinly enough to hold full flavor and the citrus hit was perfect. The shrimp toast was pillow goodness. The topping reminded me of the shrimp paste around sugar cane.\n\nThen the garlic noodles! So good! Best when eaten hot, so get it on your plate then into your belly fast. The noodles were a nice chewy texture and a subtle garlic flavor that was nothing as powerful as its garlic aroma. Then again, you're hit with garlic the moment you walk in.\n\nThen...THE CRAB!

I of course use garlic in cooking to enhance a dish and can appreciate its use, but you're not gonna find me eating at The Stinking Rose where that shit reeks of almost raw garlic, ew.   So, I was slightly skeptical as to whether I'd enjoy this garlic crab, and the garlic noodles that you can order as a side dish.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant, and I'm pleasantly surprised to find out it doesn't have an overbearing garlic smell to it.

Honestly it's a lot of crab meat so many of weaklings out there might want to follow in the footsteps of the couple next to us and \"split a crab.\"  I don't know what \"sharing\" or \"split\" a meal means as I've never done it myself, but I hear some people don't experience the food coma afterward, so I guess try it if you want.\n\nOn to the noodles, which again sounded super dicey to me.  I envisioned half-cooked garlic which would make me vomit.  Ohhhh silly girl, silly naive Jo.  No no no no- the garlic noodles were exquisite.  They tasted faintly of garlic, and like McDonald's fries, had to have a touch of sugar in them b/c they were slightly sweet and addictive as fuck.  Score.\n\nAs a sidenote, this place is a nicer restaurant, you still get a bib but it's definitely not a hole in the wall crab joint.  With that said, I wouldn't recommend it for a first or second date, b/c most girls will squirm at the thought of cracking crab legs (which might mess up our outfits, God forbid our date's crab gets flung inadvertently into our hair), and the garlic factor too, just don't do it.

The crab tastes kind of bland, however, the crab comes in a whole, not cut up. One good thing about the crab is that the flesh does not stick to the shell like PPQ's crab. The crab is overpriced considering that you will get the same result if you just steam crabs at home and make butter sauce with pepper dipping.\nPPQ's peppercorn crab is very delicious. I believe the crab is deep fried, then seasoned with sauteed garlic pieces, peppercorn, and spices. However, the crab is cut up, so you won't be able to see the crab in a whole, in case if the crab is missing a leg.\nThanh Long's garlic noodle is delicious however, it does not have any garlic pieces. Instead, they use garlic powder-infused oil. You can just go to Costco buy a big jar of McCormick garlic powder and buy cheap noodle at Ranch 99. $ 9.50 is overpriced.\nPPQ's garlic noodle has garlic pieces in it and it's priced at reasonable $6.50.\nI will not go back to Thanh Long for their peppercorn crab. I would rather spend the money for PPQ's peppercorn crab for the same amount of money (actually PPQ's is a buck cheaper - and BETTER)\n\nThe following weekend, I decided to give the tamarind crab a try. It was worse than their peppercorn crab. It lacked seasoning. For what its name, \"tamarind\", I hardly tasted the tamarind. I even thought the sauce tasted kind of like sweet and sour sauce from chinese takeout.\nThe crab flesh really didn't have flavor. Might as well I buy cooked dungeness crab from Albertsons and dip it in sweet and sour sauce for less than 10 bucks!\n$5.99/lb crab with oyster sauce from Manila Oriental Market on King Dr. would even do better for the taste and the wallet.\n\nThe secret recipe - kept in the vault - Thanh Long claim really does not live up to my expectation.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-05-21"}, {"excerpts": ["There were a lot of other things on the menu that I didn't get to try such as the Tamarind crab...", "I'll definitely be coming back for those items!"], "author": "A N.", "review": "It was my first time here and I've heard good things about their garlic noodles and crab.

First of all the Salt and Pepper was well balanced. \n\nThe key to great Fried Calamari is the balance of the squid surrounded by a light crispy crust. This squid was so thinly cut that there was little to no tasting of the squid. The moisture of the larger amount of sauted green beans, chopped red bell peppers and onions mixed with the Calamari rendered it a bit soggy. There were only about 8, maybe 9 pieces of Calamari on the dish with about a full cup of the veggies.\n\nToo many restaurants are adding superfluous ingredients that don't really add anything, but only make it look like a generous serving.\n\nSadly, Thanh Long used this technique to bulk up our serving of the Calamari.

We shared 2 crabs, one serving of noodles, 3 large plates and a dessert between 4 people.\n\nThe restaurant is quite spacious and our waiter was very friendly.

I'm not a beef person but this seemed good as well. Ours didn't come with potatoes though, but with onions.\n\nLemongrass Chicken - Slices of chicken sauteed with seasonal vegetables, garlic & chili.

There is an old school but upscale charm with Thanh Long which reminds of what people refer to as the \"Golden Age\" of dining. Much of the ornamentation is Vietnamese inspired, from the Lotus petal pendant lights, to the large dragon mural hanging from the wall, and who can forget the stereotypical dark red furniture. Overall, the antiquated atmosphere of Thanh Long compliments the cuisine well. \n\nEven though Thanh Long is a Vietnamese restaurant, the dishes we ordered did not have that signature Vietnamese flavor. Instead, the dishes are simple, straight forward, and served fast. For example, the Roast Crab is literally roasted crab with butter, salt, and pepper. In my opinion, creating a simple good tasting dish is much more difficult as their is more room for error and judgment.

We were seated within 10 minutes. \n\n For starters, I decided to try the Mango Salad after seeing many Yelpers rave about it. It has bell peppers, scallops (couldn't find any), and shrimps (previously frozen) mixed with greens. It smelled and tasted good but was very oily! Not your typical *healthy* salad. \nFor the main courses, we got the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles (obviously!). Ooooh my god the crab was so good! The crab was so buttery I think my heart almost gave out. How did they make the meat inside taste so buttery though!? The garlic noodles were pretty bland but drenched in butter. The menu states that the noddles were made with \"secret spices\"... does that mean no spice at all because it was honestly so bland. \n~ I was so full after this but my *amazing* bf decided to get me a chocolate lava cake anyway because \"we have to have cake on your birthday!\"~\nThe lava cake was way too sweet but I didn't mind because I was in such a good mood. \nThen the check came...  This restaurant is honestly reserved for special occasions only because wow... the crab itself costed about $68+? *dead* I'm sorry babe \nAll in all, I was blown away by the crab (and the price tag on it) but everything else was mediocre.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-06-12"}, {"excerpts": ["He order the garlic crab and butterfly shrimp with garlic noodles.

After a short wait, we were seated in the spacious, bright dining room by our friendly server.\n\nIt didn't take us long to decide on what classic dishes to get; the mango salad was fascinating--half cooked and half raw, it came with mango, bell peppers, and shrimp, and was a nice refreshing dish to contrast with the other heavier dishes. Of course, we got the roasted crab, which was covered in butter and seasoning and was delicious--it was surprisingly easy to peel, as the shell seemed somewhat softer than other crabs I've had. The garlic noodles were drenched in butter and absolutely decadent, and the shaking beef was fantastic as well--the filet cubes were tender and cooked a nice medium rare, and the sear and marinade on the beef imparted a nice umami flavor.\n\nOverall, this was an extremely enjoyable meal in a lively setting with quick and friendly service.

Although, they have very limited parking because it is in the city and around a residential area, they provide Valet!  I recommend valet unless you get lucky enough to park in front of the restaurant but goodluck!  Its either street parking or valet because they don't have a private lot.\n\nWhen we go here, we usually dress more business casual but it totally doesn't matter, you'll get your hands dirty anyways.  The outside of the restaurant doesn't look very pleasing/fancy but the inside looks 10x better!  We ALWAYS ALWAYS make a reservation because they get very busy, especially during the weekends.  The waiting area is quite small but they have a full bar where you can sit, wait, and have a drink.  The restaurant isn't the biggest and it gets a little tight in there, but fortunately, they do have an upstairs area.\n\nTheir customer service here is perfect.  They aren't overwhelming, but they are quick to refill your water, and they're always walking around, that way if you need something they're easily accessible.  Everyone is quick, friendly, Americanized (no racial) and professional.\n\nThe food is astounding!  We start off with ordering the Salt & Pepper Calamari, sounds plain, but it's the most flavorful calamari ever.  My boyfriend and I always share 1 crab because they are HUGE with lots of meat.  There are different flavors of crab but our favorite is the Roast Crab.  We've tried the others but Roast Crab is my all-time favorite.  We order garlic noodles on the side and the fried banana with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  The traditional Vietnamese salad and mango salad is bomb, very light but good.  If you do want to order some type of meat, the Shaken beef is super tender and melts in your mouth!  EVERYTHING IS JUST DELICIOUS AND HEAVENLY.\n\nThe food is comparable to PPQ, if you've ever been there, however, Thanh Long is more expensive but you get what you pay for!

While the garlic and green onion smelled and tasted pretty good - it was too buttery. Way too much butter that after 3 minutes when it got a little cooler a layer of fat from the butter formed around the shell of the mussels. The mussels themselves were pretty fresh though.\n\n#Roasted Crab: B.\nThis was the main dish and I had high expectation, but ended up in disappointment. Again there was a lot (not excessive this time) in the sauce, but problem was this roasted crab lacked black pepper or whatever that should have made the crab more \"roasted\". And if it was lack of taste on the outside already, needless to say the meat inside was pretty bland. At least the meat was fresh though.\n\n#Garlic Noodles: B-.\nThis was the biggest disappointment of the night. I was very looking forward to that as I heard so many good things about this dish from this place.... but there was like almost zero garlic taste..... like 1% and I'm not even exaggerating. It did taste okay, the noodle was springy, it just shouldn't be called \"garlic\" noodle though.\n\nWe also got a banana foster as dessert at the end and it was alight.

Just ignorant, I guess.  This place started the Viet seafood craze before it became fashionable.  TL is located on Judah b/t 46th & 47th in the Outer Sunset (3 blocks from beach).  Sister restaurants are Crustacean on Polk in SF and in Beverly Hills.\n\nFor six of us, we ordered 2 of each of the following, unless noted otherwise:  Salt & pepper calamari ($11.95); Soft shell crab ($12.25); Garlic toast ($3.75); Spicy eggplant w/ shrimp (19.25); Lemon grass chicken ($19.25); Saigon beef ($24.95 - one); Bo luc lac ($25.50 - one); Garlic noodles ($10.95 - three); and Roasted crab ($48.95 - market price).\n\nFirst of all, the calamari was very good.  It had excellent flavor and was not greasy.  The only downside was the price:  4 Stars.  Secondarily, the soft shell crab was a tad overcooked and overpriced.  Nonetheless, is tasted good:  3 Stars.  Thirdly, the garlic toast was OK.  It didn't taste that garlicky.  We would have been better off with the mussels served on toast:  3 Stars.\n\nFor our main courses, the spicy eggplant was very good.  The eggplant was firm and not overcooked like many restaurants.  Downsides were there wasn't much shrimp and the price:  3 Stars.  Secondarily, the chicken was colorful, but the lemongrass really didn't stand out.  It too was overpriced:  3 Stars.  Our first beef dish didn't really do anything to excite us.  The flavor was OK, but like the other dishes, it was overpriced:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the second beef dish was tender and nicely seasoned.  The only downside was the price:  4 Stars.  \n\nOur last two dishes, were the best.  TL's version of garlic noodles are the best I have had.  The noodles were al dente, weren't drowned in sauce, and the amount of garlic flavor was perfect.  No wonder so many places try to copy this dish:  5+++ Stars.  Secondarily, the roasted crab was excellent.  I used the head as a bowl.  The meat was moist and wonderfully seasoned.  It wasn't as good as R & G in Chinatown, but it still was one of the two best dishes of the evening:  5 Stars.\n\nRegarding the service, it was outstanding.  Our waitress was excellent, and took very good care of us.  She didn't write any of our orders down (inc drinks), and didn't miss anything.  The food came out quickly, and we were constantly given new bowls for our crab shells:  5 Stars.  On the other hand, the ambiance was just OK.  This place is a quaint cozy place.  However, the bathroom was kinda dirty, and the valet was expensive at $12:  3 Stars.\n\nI'd definitely come back here, but I'd stick to the seafood and garlic noodles that are excellent.

The crab came out so quick, one can probably assume it was pre-made in the kitchen. First, it wasn't even hot on the inside. It appears they roast the crabs and leave the garlic oil and seasoning until its ordered. Then they pour the seasoning and oil on top of the crab to make it hot again. also the crab was 1.5 lbs or so. I can get that size crab at Ranch 99 or something for $7.99/lb. So about $12 for that same size crab that I had to pay $55 for. That seasoning isn't worth $43! \n\nWith that said, the seasoning and taste itself was good. Just not worth the price.

So Sunday night (before Memorial Day), we didn't feel like cooking so he asked if I wanted to try this place. I first went to Yelp for reviews and famous dishes. For 3 $$$ signs, I thought - this is pretty expensive for a seafood place but maybe worth a try since we're nearby? Best decision ever made. I made a reservation (via yelp) and got a 5:30pm dinner reservation. (Yep, we eat dinner early. LOL) When we arrived, there were a few people waiting outside. We checked in (around 5:45) and got seated right away. The place was PACKED at 5:45pm!!\nI got excited as I saw people enjoying their dishes. We started with their fresh spring rolls - they were light and bite size. Good and healthy start for an appetizer since we were going to have a lot of sodium later on. Ha! We ordered some of their staple dishes: Shaken Beef - 5 stars. Colossal Prawns served with garlic noodles - 4 stars. (I'm not really a shrimp person) Spicy eggplant with Chicken - 5 stars. Just enough spice with a ton of flavor. The sweet and spicy sauce was killer! We didn't order crab since we're both not into crab really. (And frankly, I'm lazy to eat that stuff) We didn't have enough room for dessert so we skipped that. Our waitress was super nice, fast and very attentive! We got our food in less than 10 minutes upon ordering. I'll definitely come back here again. For a dinner of 2, we spent about $120.

We drove towards the setting sun, passing many other good lookin' eateries, promised a crab coma experience...\n\nWe entered a simple door. The garlic pervaded everything. It was the kind that made you hungry, newly fried garlic that makes your mouth water. All around, people sat with plastic bibs! The group of diners to my left were happily passing around the famous noodles. The couple in front of me finished ordering and started to tie back their hair. An odd thing to do, but soon I'd fully understand.\n\nI glanced down at the menu and inhaled the garlic permeating the air, agreeing it was worth the trip from downtown to the other side to eat at Thanh Long. My hometown, Nha Trang, was even labeled on the menu cover. :-) Then, the waiters tied a bib on me and walked away with a knowing look. We started with the salmon carpaccio and the shrimp toast. The salmon was sliced thinly enough to hold full flavor and the citrus hit was perfect. The shrimp toast was pillow goodness. The topping reminded me of the shrimp paste around sugar cane.\n\nThen the garlic noodles! So good! Best when eaten hot, so get it on your plate then into your belly fast. The noodles were a nice chewy texture and a subtle garlic flavor that was nothing as powerful as its garlic aroma. Then again, you're hit with garlic the moment you walk in.\n\nThen...THE CRAB! Some of the best Dungeoness crab I've ever eaten. My table ordered the roasted crab and tamarind crab. Very different. Very satisfying. I paused for a split second to be thankful all my hair was already tied up. No one at my table ate their crab carapaces, so this Vietnamese gal was in heaven with five all to herself! Then, we went garlic crazy and ordered garlic fried rice. The tamarind crab went great with it.\n\nAfter all this, I had a disappointing fried banana. Others had the orange sherbet and the molten lava cake and enjoyed their desserts. My fried banana had no hint of a sugar finish...brown, white, nor palm. The banana was no where near sweet enough to carry it. \n\nBut, I went for the crab, not the dessert.

Don't bother to order the garlic toast which is tasteless, dry and cold.Dinner was the butterfly shrimp and garlic noodle and the shrimp was beautifully grilled and tasteful , but the garlic noodle was tasteless and barely warm followed by the Cubed steak which again sat on an overwhelming amount of lettuce with a few potatoes and onions. The steak was sweet and would of been better left just grilled. Then the piece of resistance the garlic crab which was nothing spectacular and the garlic noodles which were tasteless and cold. We then ordered desert hoping they could redeem themselves and that was a joke. We ordered the Chocolate lava cake accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that had no lava gushing and looked like a flat dried out brownie. The cheesecake creme brulee had no brulee. At this point, I returned both desserts out of complete disappointment.

They definitely met my expectations, but what didn't meet my expectations was the customer service.  Although they were friendly there were just a few things that could've improved....\n\n1. My reservation was for 4 as in if I didn't make it they would charge me $100 ($25/ person) 1 of which happens to be a very noodle-hungry toddler.  They didn't give him his own cup of water, so I gave him mine, and you bet your ass I wasn't drinking from that cup after....with all that garlic noodle back wash! \n\n2. When I wanted to ask for water no one came by to check on our table, which would've given me the perfect opportunity to ask for water (yeah still on that subject.....I was thirsty).\n\n3. After a few minutes, I finally flagged someone down to get me a glass of my own water, and a dessert menu.....a few minutes passed by and I didn't get either. So when I reminded the gentleman for the dessert menu (gave up on the water) his response was \"oh yes, there are only 3 kinds.....chocolate cake, creme brulee cake, and banana\" uhhh do you want to be more specific about the 3rd option?  Is it a cake? Is it served with ice cream? Or are you just going to charge me $15 for some fucking fruit?!?!?! So I said forget it, and asked for the check.\n\n4. Oh and when the host asked us if we wanted a drink my hubby asked for a \"kentucky mule\" the host said they didn't have that....ok but I'm sure your bar tender can confirm that! \n\nOverall it was an ok experience, definitely good for take out and maybe a date with just my hubby, or maybe I came at a bad time, since they automatically charge an 18% gratuity for Father's Day they didn't feel the need to work for the tip.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-06-20"}, {"excerpts": ["we had our usual tamarind and drunken crab w garlic noodles.

Good balance of savory and sweet, but I preferred the mango salad. \n\nMain courses: \n1) 4 roasted crabs ($44/crab) for 7 people. (If you are only ordering crab, 1/person is good, but if you want to sample other entrees, it's a good idea to order less) MY LOVE. Their roasted crab...mind bogglingly delicious. Eat while its hot, and the juices drip all over and the flavor permeates through to the meat, instead of most crab places that can't get it right! \n2) shaken beef- tender buttery chunks of beef with roasted potato chunks soaked in the beef drippings. Scrumptious. \n3) 2 orders of garlic noodles- the best you'll find anymore. I love that the garlic flavor is present but not overpowering, and balances the flavor of the butter.

That was good for two people. \n\n2.) One Crab can be shared by two people max... But one can easily have a crab to themselves. I mean.. It's just CRAB.\n\n3.) Garlic Noodles -- if you're like.. eeeew my breath will stink.. NO.. it won't. Just do IT. It's more of a butter garlic taste.\n\n4.) Make reservations.\n\n5.) Have some cash for valet parking.

There is no parking lot, only street parking in the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nGot there 10 minutes before our reservation and they were able to seat us downstairs right away!

This was almost too peppered, but still delicious nonetheless.\n \n*Garlic Noodles - THE BEST garlic noodles I've ever tasted, hands down.  1 order is enough for about 3-4 people.  ($10)\n\n*Roast Crab - this is what everyone gets!  A whole crab in their special garlic sauce. They gut the inside of main body for you so the head you get is nothing but the shell. The plate is buttered for your for your dipping pleasure.  (Market price ~$40 each crab)\n\n*Fried banana with ice cream - so delicious and really hits the spot.\n\nThe service was really fast, we never waited long for anything to come out.  They give you bowls to put your crab shells in.  They refilled our water like 5 times; they were on point with checking up on our table the whole night.

The waiters put a bib around your neck and everyone gets their own cracker and small fork. I don't normally eat Roasted Crab but I know this one was really good and tasty. There was a lot of butter though, and you can see it all on the plate. The crab was salty and delicious! Tasty but the crab itself was $42.\n\nThe garlic noodles were buttery but also really good. One of the better garlic noodles that I've had. I would come back here again for the garlic noodles.\n\nOverall, this place is a great little restaurant on Judah in the Outer Sunset. Though a little expensive, the crab is a good meal to share with one or two other people. The garlic noodle was tasty and I recommend it!\n\nPros:\n-Tasty crab\n-Great tasting garlic noodle\n\nCons:\n-Crab is market price, so it'll be pricey", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Hits - roast crab, garlic noodles.

Although I've downgraded my review for both R&G and PPQ because of horrible service at our follow-up visits, as far as taste goes, in my opinion Thanh Long is at the bottom of the three.\n\nOn Sunday, 7.24.11, my friends and I came to Thanh Long for our quarterly crab dinner. It was my first time and my friends' third time here. We had reservations for 5:30 PM which I made several days prior. Thanh Long place gets packed, so reservations are highly recommended. Upon arrival we were promptly seated. \n\nAs most Yelpers have mentioned, you can forget about looking at the menu because there are only TWO THINGS to order at Thanh Long: THE CRAB and the GARLIC NOODLES! And given the rave reviews and hype, I didn't care to order anything else. \n\nF O O D\nFor a party of three we ordered:\n\n*ROASTED CRAB w/ An's Garlic Sauce & Spices (~$38) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=JuuVdF8Q2UIeOFAYHPHX8Q\nUpon first glance, I was wondering where all the garlic was. The garlic \"sauce\" was more of oil infused with garlic and black pepper. Though fragrant, the garlic flavor wasn't anywhere as pronounced as PPQ's Roasted Crab and the sauce was merely oil which left a heavy feeling after dinner. The crab was fresh and perfectly roasted though which was evident in the sweet, tender, succulent meat. \n\n*DRUNKEN CRAB w/ Chardonnay, Sake, Brandy, Scallions & Black Pepper (~$38) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=ObzTM78quAF_QKol4BqGcA\nIf you're more of a crab purist (or an alcoholic) and like to taste it in its unadulterated form, then the Drunken Crab is the way to go. The meat was clean tasting and you can taste all its natural sweetness. It was lightly infused with the trio of alkies, though sake was the most prominent flavor giving it a subtle dry wine flavor.\n\n*GARLIC NOODLES w/ Special Garlic Sauce & Spices (2 orders @ $9.50/each) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=JUXoSeXnlJljPgzqmexqAg\nGarlic noodles and any solid noodle dish for that matter should be al-dente with a nice, chewy toothsome bite to it to show its freshness and proper execution. Though deliciously buttery and fragrant with lots of garlicky bits, Thanh Long's garlic noodles were choppy and mushy. \n\nPlease note: Thanh Long uses tons of MSG to flavor their food; enough to keep me waking up in the middle of night and running to the kitchen to get a glass of water to sooth my dry throat. \n\nS E R V I C E\nLet's just say the busboy was way more attentive than our waiter. The only thing our waiter did was take our order, bring our food and give us our bill; he never once checked on us. I wasn't surprised though as we have ran into the same service issues at R&G and PPQ and subpar service seems to be a reoccurring theme at many Asian restaurants. The only redeeming thing is our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering. \n\nA M BI AN C E / D E C O R\nA step above your typical Vietnamese restaurant, Thanh Long has crisp white linen tables and the waitstaff don purple mandarin collared attire. A fairly large restaurant, Thanh Long is a good option for large parties and family dinners. I noticed that a lot of people were on dates though it's very, very loud at Thanh Long.\n\nP A R K I N G\nAlthough I got lucky and found parking in less than 5 minutes across the street, I heard finding street parking can be very difficult in the area. Valet parking is available for $10. \n\nCompared to R&G (known for their Salt & Pepper Crab), R&G's crab has much more intense flavor with a spicy kick and the fried batter gives it a nice crispy texture contrast to the sweet, tender crab meat. PPQ's Roasted Crab is heavily covered in buttery garlic and each bite is like a garlic clove has exploded in your mouth which is different than Thanh Long's crab which is more subdued sitting in a wading pool of garlic infused oil and black pepper.\n\nSo, who reigns supreme? It all boils down to what flavors you're looking for. If want something deliciously salty and spicy with a crunch, R&G's Salt & Pepper is the King. However, if you want something sinfully rich with a strong BURST of garlicky flavor, than PPQ's Roasted Crab definitely trumps Thanh Long's.

Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order. The prawns did have a tendency to stick to their shells, but they were perfectly done and marinated in some fantastic sauce to make them outstanding.\n\nThe Garlic noodles had the perfect consistency of Yee Noodles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_mein, which gives them an extra nice bite and appear to absorb the flavors better. They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["The garlic noodles everyone talks about were ok.

To get my verdict, read 'til the end.\n\nThere's shady-looking valet parking available, but also a ton of neighborhood streets to try and squeeze your vehicle into. The restaurant itself is rather nice on the inside (especially comparative to the exterior). Hostess and waiter service was predictably Asian. Reservations are definitely helpful, but food comes out blazing fast.\n\nNo surprises here. Between the fiance and I, we ordered two roasted crabs and a plate of roasted garlic noodles. Cost is prohibitive. Crabs are market rate, and went for somewhere between $35-$40 each (I forget the precise price). Garlic noodles are $9.\n\nStarting with the noodles, they were delicious. The chow mein-styled noodles were juicy and tasty with just a bare hint of the crispiness from the pan. They were flavored well, though not as overtly garlic-y as I had expected. My only qualm is that it's ONLY noodles, nothing else. Not even a green onion garnish or anything. For that price point, I thought there would be more.\n\nAs for the crab, it comes whole, and it's up to you to put in the work. For seafood lovers, one crab is optimal, but that's too much cholesterol for my book. Still the crab was delicious, with a plate dripping in black pepper butter. The best bites are those where you take a swab of black pepper direct to the tongue. It adds a bite that makes your mouth water. \n\nStill, we had our crab comparators. She was more of a fan of the Fisherman's Wharf in DC. I couldn't help but compare it to the spicy black pepper crab from Singapore. Thanh Long just couldn't quite measure up to those two.\n\nIn a normal market, Thanh Long is great.

I also had trouble locating which building is Thanh Long. This place for sure did not stand out to me. It was nothing special from the exterior. So I was very pleased to see just how beautiful and classy the inside of the restaurant was. They have a full bar in the front when you first walk in. And a second story for their customers. Lighting in here is quite dim which I love. It helps to create a much more intimate atmosphere. We celebrated a friend's birthday here so we dressed to impress. But it wouldn't be totally inappropriate to show up casual. I just wouldn't suggest walking up in there with like beach wears or something. \n\nTips: They DO take reservations so be sure to take advantage of that and do so. It'll save yourself a lot of time and pain waiting in line, anticipating their delicious food. And if you do have reservation, be sure to arrive early. It took me about 15-20 minutes to drive EVERYWHERE  around the neighborhood, circling the block several times before finding a parking spot. NOT just a decent parking spot, just any parking spot AT ALL. It was ridiculous. The point is, don't be late for your reservation. Not only that, but make sure your whole party is on time. Not just a few of you because that wouldn't count. And no, calling them to let them know you're on your way will not help. They may stretch it by 5 minutes, but that's about it. So to my ladies and drag queens, if you're going to wear high heels...you're about to have SOOOOO much fun walking a couple of blocks to destination.

My mind wondered, 'are cokes refillable?'...'where are the restrooms?'...'how much is 'market price'?'...'does the waiter know I'm not really paying attention?'\n\nBack to reality...'did he say 500 hundred crabs?'  Where do they even keep that many crabs laying around I thought.  At that point, I wasn't sure if he mentioned it already, so to save some possible embarrassment I didn't inquire about the crabs, nodded, and just asked...'where are the restrooms?' \n\nParking was more difficult than I expected as street parking sucked that day.  My laziness within grew with valet parking available tempting me.  The outrageous cost of $12 bucks and the thought of someone joy riding in my valuable antique of a Corolla didn't sit well with me.  The Sunset weather by the water was its usual half dreary self.  Contrast to the outside, inside the restaurant was vibrant and warm.  Aroma of good times filled the place; passing each table we saw at least one crab on the table.  Hold those horses...part of the waiter's yada yada yada included \"90% of people order the crab\".  \n\nIf it were me, our order would have consisted of all crab and garlic noodles.  Due to food allergies and cholesterol consciousness at the table, a full spectrum of dishes was chosen.  \n\nOUR ORDER:     \n*Lemongrass chicken satay - These grilled chicken skewers come numbering around three or four.  This was the first item that came out and everyone was hungry.  Playing the disappearing act in a poof, I only ate a sliver of a sliver sized piece.  My taste buds do not recall anything negative.  There were no complaints either.  \n\n*Salt & pepper calamari - One of my sister's go to dishes no matter where, when, and how.  How can you go wrong with deep fried calamari?  You can't; unless they were soggy which these were not.  Salt and pepper were abundantly prevalent throughout.  The chunks of calamari were a larger size calamari than usual.  Bigger means more calamari meat and less batter.  Less batter is typically good thing.  \n\n*Shaken beef - Shaken, not stirred...I didn't taste the \"shaken\", but the cubes of meat were very tender.  Served on a bed of green and mixed in with some potato, the meat has a sharp peppery taste.  I recommend this for people with seafood allergies that come here.    \n  \n*Lemongrass chicken - Didn't I order something with lemongrass as an appetizer already?  I repeated \"lemongrass\" a couple times under my breath unsure of this when ordering.  We needed another dish for the non-seafood eaters at the table anyway.  Consisting of probably all dark meat, the chicken was very simplistically lemongrass-ed.  There were more bell peppers than I would have liked.  The noticeable echo of pepper flavor popped up again.  I wonder how much pepper this restaurant uses in a day.   \n\n*\"Colossal\" royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles - My main chagrin about this plate was the adjective \"colossal\" attached to the prawns.  All the pictures I saw, they looked humongous.  I bet the picture I took even look gigantic.  Truly, it is an optical illusion.  While unexpectedly smaller they were also a smidgen on the salty side for me.  Overdosed on seasoning, the prawns sat on top of garlic noodles.  The spillover of seasoning into the garlic noodles unassumingly enhanced the noodles.  The garlic noodles are good by themselves; the extra touch of seasoning really made the whole that much better.  If I go again, I'll pass on this one, but was decent. \n\n*Roast crab - Presentation is absolutely photogenic.  I'm talking about super model level.  The crab was very meaty and a nice size.  They really saved the best for last, as this was the last entr\u00e9e to be served.  Cut down the middle with all the legs intact, the shell of the crab is ornamentally placed on top of the legs.  Their \"garlic sauce and secret sauce\" fully cooked into the crab meat and needless to say, I started to dip some noodles in the dressing.  It was good stuff.  To nitpick, freshness rating of the crab wasn't A+, rather an A-.    \n \n*Steamed rice - That's how my dad rolls.  Can't go anywhere without it.  I had to add this one or it wouldn't be a complete review.  The white rice came in a bowl and tasted...rice-like.  My dad thoroughly enjoyed it with a big smile.\n\nThanh Long is an Americanized Vietnamese restaurant that is versatile enough to draw even the most Asian of Asians.  If you read the articles down the hallway to the restroom, there's a feel good story behind restaurant's owners (Remember that question about where the restrooms were?  Yeah...there was a line and I had some time to read.).  The main attraction is their crab and garlic noodles.

Garlic noodles included here, see review below.\n\nShaken Beef - 4/5. Cubes of New York strip steak cooked medium rare. Nailed the cooking method, but the seasoning was heavy handed and a tad heavy on the oil.\n\nDrunken Crab - 4/5. Cooked very well - crab meat retained its moisture. Lightly seasoned to help the crab flavor shine.\n\nRoast Crab - 2/5. A risk for roasting crab is overcooking, leaving the meat dry. In this case, the crab was just on the cusp of being dried out, an unfortunate followup of the perfectly cooked Drunken Crab. The seasoning was well done, so I suspect that if the crab was more moist this dish would definitely shine.\n\nGarlic Noodles - 2/5. Although very highly rated, it was a complete miss.

I ordered this for my girlfriend because she was feeling under the weather. I also had some for myself and well, among all the different soups I've drank before, this one was.. unique.

For a few years we have missed opportunities to try Thanh Long.  We have a friend who raves about it, but somehow we never made it.  I finally tried Thanh Long last weekend with our friend, and now I understand why she speaks so highly of this restaurant.  I am also regretting that I could have been there a few more times by now instead of just once.\n\nLast Saturday we had a late dinner.  Driving to the restaurant my friend warned me that we would probably have to wait awhile for a table.  I don't mind waiting if the food is good.  However when we arrived we were seated immediately.  It was late, maybe 9:00PM on a Saturday, so if you can wait for a late dinner this may be the time to come.\n\nLooking at the other tables, it was easy to see what to order.  Every table was the same -- garlic noodles and roasted crab.  We started with a mango salad, which was totally yum.  Then the real bomb -- the garlic noodles.  They are simple, I could totally make this at home, but OMG they are awesome!  We also split a roast dungeness crab, another dish that I frequently make when crab is in season, but sometimes it is nice to sit down and enjoy a good meal without having to cook it.\n\nFor the meal we ordered, the Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc which turned out to be a PERFECT PAIRING to our food.  I was proud of myself for going past the rather large Chardonnay selection on the wine list.  I think  the buttery flavor of a California Cardonnay would have been in competition with the other flavors on the table, so I wonder why they had so many on the list?  A white with a little more acidity and fruit was just the ticket.  I had only tried Duckhorn's reds prior to this evening, but I must say the Sauvignon Blanc was remarkable and I will seek out a bottle for home next time I am serving crab.  I usually go for Voigner with shellfish, but they didn't have one to offer...why?  You are  a classy restaurant, get your wines sorted please.\n\nI withhold the fifth star because I'm not that easy.  Thanh Long was a great meal and I will definitely take my wife here when she gets back in town, but it is really priced high.  With tip, dinner for two where we shared a mango salad, split an order of garlic noodles, and had only one crab between us with a bottle of wine was $175 with tip.  Ouch!  My wallet stings a bit.  I can buy 6 crabs this size for $50 off a boat in Pillar Point Harbor, the noodles cost next to zero and the salad was simple enough.  Honestly, this can't be a regular place at this price.  Come to think of it, the company I kept this night may have been the best part, but Ann is like that.  I am lucky to have her as a friend.\n\nBottom line:  garlic noodles with crab and sauvignon blanc, it's all good.

It's not even one huge \"how did they even find a prawn this big?\" prawn anymore, it's FOUR SMALL SHRIMP on a bed of garlic noodles. With \"secret spices\".

Constant, polite attention, but always a feeling of being rushed so they could get the next seating in. When I ordered the vegetable soup with seafood wontons (btw the best thing we had), I asked to split it with my dinner partner. Not only did the waiter forget to bring a bowl, but he brought the soup AT THE SAME TIME as all the entrees! Who does that? Who in their right mind brings soup at the same time as entrees? Someone who wants cold entrees, that's who. I asked him to bring my entree back because it was going to get cold, and he said he'd have the kitchen make another one, but he was a liar, and just put it under the lights. It was drying out when it came back.\n\nThe prawns were extremely average (and overcooked having sat under the lights while I enjoyed my soup), the crab a PITA to shell, Dungeness always is, so much work for so little meat. If you really want good crab order fresh King Crab legs from many places in Alaska and have them overnighted once crab season opens, you'll enjoy tender succulent huge sausages of meat that don't need \"secret spices.\" Or anything, you just eat them.\n\nI was disappointed that the prawns had shrunk, and the noodles are fine, but if you really want noodles go to a good Italian place, they do them better.\n\nDessert was a lemon sorbet with cream inside a hollowed out lemon. A for presentation, but they should just skip the cream. Either make ice cream or sorbet, but the mixing of the two is an unhappy marriage.\n\nI literally have no idea why this place is popular, and how they can get away with charging what they do.

So if a restaurant gets this rating from me, they deserve it.  Hands down, flat out, case closed, done dig-giddy dada (I know... just go with the moment).\n\nI've heard a lot about Thanh Long and looked forward to trying it.  I got the opportunity when in the Bay area this past weekend.\n\nI've been an advocate for \"hole in the wall\" restaurants over chains because 1. I think the food most of time tastes a lot better and 2. The intimacy of a small establishment caters to my \"less crowd, less noise\" mantra.\n\nFrom the outside, Thanh Long does not look impressive.  But when you notice a flood of people going in and coming out either something illegal is happening or they have really good food.  Thanh Long has really, really, good food.\n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and my hats off to the bartender.  I'm not a big drinker at all.  That said, I think every person should have a signature drink.  For me, it's Drambuie.  Because it's not an average drink and only consumed by the most worldly of people (ah-em), I can tell instantly the status of a restaurant when I order it and the waiter says \"huh, what's that?\"  Or the bartender simply smiles and says, \"I'm sorry sir, we don't have that.\"  He knows that you know, the sophistication of their restaurant is FOS at that point.\n\nThanh Long serves Drambuie.  I'm just saying.\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate - just how I like it.  \n\nWe ordered the Crab, fried rice, garlic noodles and mango salad.\n\nThe mango salad was nice.  Teased ever so gently with shrimp and thick cuts of mango.  I didn't care for it being slightly warmed, but I didn't mind either.\n\nThe fried rice was delicate, delicious and just amazing.  The garlic noodles were awesome.  The next time I go to Panda and they're talking \"garlic noodles,\" I think I'm going to just call the police.  Thanh Long's garlic noodles are by far the best I've ever had.\n\nThe Crab, unless you don't like getting your hands dirty, then you need to order something else.  Steamed in pepper and other seasoning with just enough of a buttery hint that I was sitting at the table licking my fingers.  Yeah, I know. No table etiquette, but at that point I didn't care.  And if you're wondering, it was so good I would have ate the shell.\n\nI'll be going back to the Bay area in another month and I'm already making reservations for round 2 at Thanh Long.\n\nWhat better way to acknowledge their food is that good.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-04-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Don't order anything but crab and the garlic noodles.

The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.

This is the point where most waiters would offer to replace the dish, but no, this waiter seemed quite clueless. So I asked for some condiments (many Vietnamese restaurants have LOTS of different condiments). All he had was hot sauce and soy sauce, so I had to make the dish edible (barely) with those.

Probably the easiest thing to make. Again, completely inauthentic. No sesame, soy or scallion flavors. White bread and cheese? WTF? Fail.\n\nRed Snapper- Where do I start. I expected this dish to be prepared with a whole fish wrapped in some sort of banana leaf, but it instead arrived in the form of two limp, overcooked fillets. The sauce was too thin and not flavorful, it lacked a sense of completion. The only redeeming quality of the plate were the garlic noodles everyone here is raving about.

While following her she told me that she appreciated my apology and to enjoy my meal. \n\nFood: \nDungeness Crab Puffs - delicious - a great appetizer for a larger group, there were 6 in one serving. \n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari - a little too much salt on this one, still good though!  Next time we'll try the Grilled Calamari \n\nShaken Beef - HOLY MOLEY DELICIOUS - Meat was SO tender and so flavorful - definitely recommend this. \n\nSiagon Beef - Not my favorite - the rest of my family like this but unfortunately this dish did NOT please my taste buds - I felt as though maybe the ingredients were way above my appreciation but it tasted too bitter for me. \n\nDrunken Crab - this was delicious - a whole crab, dunked in a secret sauce of Chardonney... \n\nRoasted Crab - this was EVEN better than the Drunken Crab - amazing. \n\nGarlic Noodles - MUST HAVE AT THE TABLE. These are the staple dish of every visit, in my opinion. \n\nI really like this place - I've had the Garlic Noodles before on their An The Go mobile food truck.

For starters, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari. The calamari was good, though I'm usually used to having some sort of dipping sauce with it. Lightly breaded. Then we ordered to the Vietnamese traditional salad, which was the perfect starter to a heavy meal; it was light and refreshing. \n\nAs for the entree, each of us had one roast crab each. Previous reviews definitely reflected well; the roast crab is delicious. It seems as though they must marinade the crab ahead of time (probably why the restaurant doesn't open until 5) because the crab came out quickly but was still tasty. We paired the crab with two orders of the garlic noodles - great combo. The noodles are rich - garlic-y and buttery YUM - and went well with the crab.\n\nFor dessert, we had the fried banana with ice cream.

I of course use garlic in cooking to enhance a dish and can appreciate its use, but you're not gonna find me eating at The Stinking Rose where that shit reeks of almost raw garlic, ew.   So, I was slightly skeptical as to whether I'd enjoy this garlic crab, and the garlic noodles that you can order as a side dish.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant, and I'm pleasantly surprised to find out it doesn't have an overbearing garlic smell to it.  Awesome.  I was tempted to stray from convention and try the Tamarind crab, or the Drunken crab (cooked in white wine and olive oil I think), but everyone kept stressing how legit the garlic roast one was.  Ok, I caved.\n\nBoy, I've never been so happy to cave into peer pressure as I was Friday night.  The garlic roast crab was sooooooooo delicious, I went to town on that motha.  I kindof pride myself on my waspy crab-eating skills, I can pick every single morsel of meat out of a crab leg, which I did again that night.  Honestly it's a lot of crab meat so many of weaklings out there might want to follow in the footsteps of the couple next to us and \"split a crab.\"  I don't know what \"sharing\" or \"split\" a meal means as I've never done it myself, but I hear some people don't experience the food coma afterward, so I guess try it if you want.\n\nOn to the noodles, which again sounded super dicey to me.  I envisioned half-cooked garlic which would make me vomit.  Ohhhh silly girl, silly naive Jo.  No no no no- the garlic noodles were exquisite.  They tasted faintly of garlic, and like McDonald's fries, had to have a touch of sugar in them b/c they were slightly sweet and addictive as fuck.  Score.\n\nAs a sidenote, this place is a nicer restaurant, you still get a bib but it's definitely not a hole in the wall crab joint.  With that said, I wouldn't recommend it for a first or second date, b/c most girls will squirm at the thought of cracking crab legs (which might mess up our outfits, God forbid our date's crab gets flung inadvertently into our hair), and the garlic factor too, just don't do it.

The entire bottom of the plate was covered in chopped romaine lettuce, but was hidden under beef, giving the impression that the plate was full of beef. In addition, there were ample chopped potatoes sauteed to LOOK like beef. There were maybe a total of 9 piece of actual beef on the plate, for about $20-$25. \n\nThe sea bass was absolutely bland. It was cooked with no seasoning, AT ALL. The saving grace for this dish was the accompanying sauce on the side, which had a slight sweet, citrus flavor to it.

I'm pretty sure bok choy i s$0.79/lb at the supermarket. If you're gonna skimp on the portion of the fish, you could at least use more than one bok choy.\n\nThanh Long has always had a special place in my heart for their crab. No more.

It looked like it was covered in black pepper, but had no taste at all = pre-ground black pepper. I RARELY use salt to cook, and my usual complaint when I eat out is that the food is too salty.

Garlic noodles are not bad, but it just goes really well with the crab.\n\nAs for dessert, I highly recommend finishing off with the fried ice cream. It's pretty big so you can split it with two or three people.

It is better to go with one of the dry white wines.  For a Vietnamese place, they don't use a lot of sour flavors, so the dry wine brings a little acidity to the food and makes the flavors come out.\n\nThe dessert menu was not very exciting.  Deep fried banana, chocolate molten cake.  All the standard stuff.  Nothing unusual or complicated.  We skipped it.\n\nThe service was typical for an Asian restaurant.  Not very attentive.

Sad to say, it wasn't as good as I remembered. \n\nLychee Martini: for the price, probably not worth it. I was able to thoroughly enjoy it which isn't a good thing for all of you alcoholics out there, seeing as how I can easily k.o. after 1/3 a beer bottle.\n\nThanh Long Mussels: served on a slice of baguette with pesto sauce. this was pretty good, although I didn't appreciate how it was swimming in butter, but hey if you're going to eat at Thanh Long, the last thing you should do is count calories right?\n\nTraditional Vietnamese Salad: i'm glad we ordered some sort of veggie dish. for the most, it was tasty but the fish sauce was overly sweet and not salty/savory enough. it really needs more of a kick that \"Vietnamese vinaigrette\" usually has. \n\nWe also ordered a few more appetizers, but I can't seem to recall them, I guess they weren't too memorable in my book. Oh well!\n\nRoasted Crab: still freakin delicious. I love how no matter what time of the year you come here, the crabs are always ginormous and fresh! \n\nGarlic Noodles: Such a sad disappointment! What happened to the garlic in garlic noodles?? You can smell it, but for some reason you can't taste it at all. *sigh* what a tease! For the most part, it was pretty bland, and tasted like they only used garlic powder, so there wasn't any real, fresh, authentic garlic bite to it. So, so sad. \n\nFor dessert, we all shared a bunch, in case you go thinking my belly is some sort of bottomless pit (I wish). \n\nFried Banna a la Mode: It tastes exactly what it sounds like. it was good, but nothing mind blowing.\n\nOrange Sorbet: it was served in a frozen orange shell and was rock hard. Whatever shavings of this sorbet I manage to get before giving up, was light, and refreshing. If only it was easier to eat. \n\nTraditional Banana Cake a la Mode: Okay, I don't even know how to contain myself on this one. I'm not a crazy fan of bananas, but omg. This has become one of the best desserts I've ever had in my whole entire life. I dream of the day that I go back to Thanh Long just for this orgasmic worthy dessert. I might be over hyping it, but it was pretty damn good. The bananas in the cake added a nice caramelized texture, and when you eat it with a spoon of ice cream, the mixture of hot and cold, sweet and savory all just mixes in your mouth, making it a perfect ending to any meal.\n\nSo to conclude my dining experience, here's your take home message: do NOT forget to order the banana cake a la mode. or else you're just shooting yourself in the foot.

The crab was delicious, huge, and good for both my girlfriend and I. (GF is a small eater, so probably you might wanna order 1 crab per person).

Salt & Pepper Calamari - delicious except for the simple overdose of coarsely ground black pepper; will definitely tell them next time to adjust the black pepper with a lighter touch\n\n2. Mango Salad - fresh mango fruit sauteed with bell peppers, seared scallops & shrimp over mixed greens in a raspberry vinaigrette - this would make for an excellent  meal on it's own; the raspberry vinaigrette nicely tied the various flavors together effortlessly\n\n3. Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant - eggplant sauteed with jumbo prawns, chicken, fresh basil, baby corn, shitake mushrooms, & red chilies in a tamarind & chili-soya; I like spicy but it was on the low end of the spicy spectrum on this dinner outing though the overall flavors were good ~ will order it again but tell the server to make it spicier\n\n4. Villager's Favorite - Pacific prawns & pork medallions simmered in a caramelized reduction of soy and herbs; I liked this dish enough that I would order it again; a nice take on a \"surf and turf\" with pork instead of beef for the \"turf\" portion\n\n5. Shaken Beef - tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes; delicious in flavor with fork tender beef; the greens I could do without as it seemed more a \"salad\" than an entree\n\n6. Vegetarian Delight - silken tofu sauteed with asst. vegetables & shitake mushrooms; a standout as I love tofu and veggies!\n\n7. Roast Crab - a whole Dungeness crab roasted with An's garlic sauce & secret spices in the Secret Kitchen; regardless of what others may say, this in of itself is a delectable Dungeness crab entree!  Yes it's messy but who cares?  The flavors marry very well and our entire party enjoyed this dish.\n\n8. Garlic Noodles - An's famous noodles made with their secret garlic sauce (perhaps the one used on the Roast Crab?) & secret spices; this noodle dish is good when hot but at room temperature or worse, cold, it's not that good (something coagulates on the noodles when it's cold...butter perhaps?)\n\nDespite the large amounts ordered per item, we had lots of left overs (crab included) for our party of 18.

Two of us ordered the Fleur de Mango - pureed fresh mango, Malibu rum, a banana rum and freshly squeezed orange juice to the mix - this was the fave drink of the evening!  \n \nWhile parking is an issue, it's located in a neighborhood folks, get there early so that you can look for parking or just valet your car.

The dish looked like large tater tots of beef sitting on a salad with dressing. Anything but, the savory beef roll-ups were stuffed with prosciutto and swiss cheese, cooked medium rare, and smothered in a sauce that tasted like a peppery vinaigrette. It was warm and went with the mixed salad greens surprisingly well, I would order this again, big portion too. For dessert we had their Creme Brulee to share. It was out in less than 5 minutes, golden brown, crisp top, and so creamy, it was delicious.

My pareng Jimmy kept telling me about this place called Thanh Long that had amazing crabs that were decked out in a nice garlic pepper sauce.  I've heard about this place for months now.  Being from San Diego, it took awhile to try it but it was definitely worth the wait.\n\nThe place seems like a hole in the wall from the outside.  The location isn't the prettiest in the world so it made me kind of skeptical of the place.  I walked in and saw a BUSY environment filled with people waiting at the door step.  We had reservations so we got seated fairly quickly.  \n\nThere's a full menu of things to order but we went simple and went straight for the crab.  At first we decided to go with some appetizers so we started off with the cheese wontons.  They're decent.  I'm not sure I'd recommend getting them.  I'd probably say just wait for the main course.  The crabs are HUGE.  We were a party of 7 so we decided to order 4 king crabs and some garlic noodles to accompany the crabs.  We went simple with our order.  We ordered two of the drunken crabs and two of the \"roast' ones that featured a nice peppered garlic sauce on it.\n\nWe got our order after about 15 minutes.  Not too shabby.  Good food takes awhile so I wasn't really concerned with the timing.  I took one bite of the roast crab.  WOW.  The peppered garlic sauce is AMAZING.  I don't think I've ever tried crab THAT GOOD.  I broke off a couple of legs and began digging in.  I dipped the crab meat into the garlic sauce and felt heaven after each bite.  What makes things even better was the garlic noodles.  They're SO GOOD.  I think I had like two plates of the garlic noodles to myself!  I ate so much food.  There's also a bunch of crab fat in the head.  Just writing this review is getting me hungry.  Unfortunately, I'm back in San Diego!!!\n\nI also tried the drunken crab.  It's alright.  I don't think I would order it again though.  I think my next trip would consist of roast crab, garlic noodles, and sapporo beer.  Keep it simple.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and EVERYONE.  \n\nIf you are in the LA area, I believe the owner of Thanh Long also owns CRUSTACEAN.  I think it's a upper scale version of Thanh Long.

Came here for my friend's b-day dinner.  A crab specialty restaurant in the outer...OUTER sunset next to the cold, foggy beach.  A bit of a trek with many other similar places more east on Clement St.  You walk in and you will be greeted by the host (reservations are encouraged as it is a BUSY place even during the week) with a bar on the right.  It is fully stocked and we all got a glass of Oban for a pricey number.\n\nWhen seated about 10 minutes after our reservation was actually for we had a great server.  Surrounded by an interesting decor we ordered as appetizers calamari and oysters.  I didn't have the oysters but the calamari was well cooked but over seasoned if you ask me.  It was peppery which I do like but way too salty.   Because I love calamari, I ate much of the order but was invited to enjoy a long period of salty tongue and 2 glasses of ice water.  For the mains, we had crab which is the specialty, \"shaken\" beef, garlic noodles and seabass.   Crab was well cooked and tender.  The shaken beef was cooked medium to the \"T.\"  The seabass also tasty with the sauce it comes with but perhaps just a touch overcooked.  Finally, the garlic noodles were also very tasty if you LOVE garlic.  If garlic is only a passing notion in your home cooking you will think this is romantic disaster when it comes to post-dinner make-out sessions.\n\nLastly, because the portions are on the smaller side we had to order an extra dish for the 4 of us...the curry lotus prawns.  This had to be the worst of all our selections.  The shrimp were over cooked and tiny....oh whoops, weren't they called \"prawns\" on the menu???  In any case, the curry was bland and even if you liked it, there was barely enough curry sauce to mix into you rice like many expect in a Thai type curry house.  The veggies it comes with were....eh.  Water chestnuts were ok.  The baby corn tasted like canned baby corn.  All-in-all I'd leave this off your choices to order...\n\nSo in summary, a fancy, pricey Vietnamese crab house at the beach in SF.  A fun place to visit if you live locally and enjoy it.

I honestly thought it was just some hole in the wall.  But when we got in, we saw all the excited and probably very hungry diners.  For decor and cleanliness, I'd rate it 3 stars.\n\nWe all ordered the roasted crab.  Several had to have a whole crab each, but I split mine as I wanted to try other dishes.  I also ordered the red snapper \"Thang Long Fish\" dish and an extra plate of garlic noodles.  The crab was really good.  They obviously manage their crab selection very carefully.  All the crabs were fat 2.5lb and very juicy, a sign that they bought the freshest and the best available.  Since I've had great crabs for most of my life, I can say that the crab was solidly above average.  Their garlic butter sauce that generously covers the crab is the defining difference.  It's not something you'd want to eat more than twice a month, but it sure feels good. \n\nThe only downside is the price.  $37 for one crab (current market price) and no sides is pretty steep.  I've done my own roasting in the oven many times and it's just as good.  I guess I can try soaking it with sauteed garlic in butter too.  Since crabs are in season now, I can probably replicate the crab for $7-9.  \n\nAs for the garlic noodles, I suppose the experience of having hot butter-covered noodles for the first time is close to orgasmic.  But, I've had and made my share of them, so their garlic noodles were rather underwhelming.  The noodles themselves weren't fresh or tasty.  There wasn't enough fresh garlic mixed in to deliver them from mediocrity.  For $10 a plate of unadorned noodles, I'd expected to be freshly made and tossed.  \n\nThe \"Thang Long Fish\" was equally bland and underwhelming.

Unfortunately, the fish was no more exciting than what I could get at Red Lobster.

The orange sorbet came in a kitschy hollowed-out orange peel.

I'd never had butter garlic crab elsewhere and the flavor was just too good! I'm guessing they steam the crab with salt, pepper, and garlic infused butter (as there's always glops of salt on top making some bites super salty). The sauce the crab comes in is just butter infused with garlic (I have yet to see garlic chunks anywhere...) which is good for dipping, but I think the crab itself has enough flavor. The garlic noodles are interesting to say the least -- every time I get them they are cold, so I don't know if they are supposed to be that way. The noodles are slightly sweet and no as garlicy as the crab... it just seems out of place to me as I am eating fresh hot crab with cold noodles. I've also had their garlic rice (obviously not as novel), which I like better than the noodles, probably just because it's warm and hence doesn't have a temperature difference with the star of the show. \n\nTheir vegetables are delicious! I didn't think I'd be ordering veggies at a seafood restaurant, but their string beans are cooked and seasoned perfectly with seasonable vegetables and a variety of mushrooms (yum!).\n\nThe most recent time I came the crab was not fresh - we were charged $40/crab (yes I know it's seasonal) and the flesh was not fresh. One person in our party even ended up with diarrhea the next day =/\n\nService is horrible... waitresses never come around. The place is ALWAYS crowded, and even when we had a reservation we had to wait 30 minutes (what is up with that?!) \n\nPPQ vs Thanh Long\nSo I find PPQ better and more price worthy. At PPQ you can get a full 4 course meal (appetizer, crab, noodles, dessert) for about $60. The crab and garlic noodles themselves are equally priced between the two, but PPQ offers a set menu which makes it more reasonable. The crab is different as it doesn't have much flavor itself, but the garlic butter sauce is WAY BETTER! There's garlic chunks in the sauce, making it all the more rich and savory.

From the restaurant's humble beginnings to a much larger empire and perhaps a mini conglomerate, their story certainly represents the budding entrepreneur's desire and passion to map and live out the American Dream.\n\nI had fond memories coming here during the early 90s, when this place was IT. Way before Yelp, Chowhound, and arguably Slanted Door, this was definitely an SF favorite and one of the greatest Vietnamese/fusion restaurants.\n\nBack then the neighborhood where Thanh Long is located wasn't a place overun by thugs and crime like it is these days, although the pain in the ass parking problems were somewhat there and I'm sure has not improved today.\n\nThis restaurant was at the time much smaller and less decorative than it is now, which gave this place a bit of a mom and pop feel, in addition to being a restaurant in a primarily residential area. Most kids who dined here at the time with their parents would rush over across the street to the 7-Eleven and play some coin-op games while their parents stood around like hapless sheep, waiting for their names to be called. So thanks mom & dad, for sticking around while me and my brother were wasting away our life in front of a coin-op machine for upwards of 30 mins each!\n\nWhile there were a variety of items to consume and choose from here, practically everyone ordered the signature items, which is the buttery garlic pepper roasted dungeoness crab, perhaps the garlic tiger prawns, the signature garlic noodles of course, and perhaps end with a banana flambe / fried banana with ice cream. There was never a need to mess around and try something else.\n\nAs seemingly romantic this place may seem to bring a date to impress, the idea of wearing bibs and getting your hands greased up with more grease juice flying across the table as you break open an arm or a leg (of the crab of course, not some thug ass off the street, try holding a lead pipe, Glock or Sig Sauer after your hands are all buttered up), and getting said butter garlic pepper grease all over your chin like a Dirty Gomez, is not slick (no pun intended) or smart by any means.\n\nI have to say that ever since SF's Crustacean opened, I've been witnessing a steady decline in overall quality and dining experience here as the decor and ambience upgraded (they have since added a much larger alcohol bar too for your frou frou drunken needs), both of which have been rather inconsistent. Although I have not been back in some years, the last visit circa 2001/2002 here just did not hit the spot. The crab while was within season, was way too greasy (too much butter and a tad bit salty), and the garlic noodles were very messy (the delicate balance and flavors that were once there are gone). Perhaps the chefs have moved on to the bigger side of the businesses/empire, I don't know.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the dress code is not as drastically enforced here as it is at Crustacean.

Hills and SF Crustaceans... the only memorable thing was the aquarium walk way from the entrance into the dining hall in the BH location) I heard both Crustacean and Thanh Long went downhill but decided to give it a few tries before reaching any sort of conclusions. \n\nTwo of my recent Thanh Long visits were average / below average but  during the most recent dinner:\n\n1. The bartender (some dude with braided long hair) was rude, dismissive, and a jerk!! I've NEVER been treated this way at a bar. EVER.

No joke.\n\n2.The server spilled our beers on us and instead of immediately bringing napkins and or hot towels for our clothes, he disappeared towards the bar to clean himself up. We sat there covered in beer for a while before the hostess finally brought us extra linens =/ When he came back with extra napkins (5 min. too late) he didn't even apologize for spilling and said \"I have slippery fingers haha\" Um hello? This IS a fine dining establishment, correct? Am I mistaken to expect WAY more professional service?\n\n3. The crabs were fresh and meaty but WAY too salty\n\n4. The garlic noodles were not al dente and WAY salty  =(\n\nI was with a first time Thanh Long-er who seemed to enjoy his food but I was NOT happy. I almost complained but didn't want to ruin my date's dinner.\n\nI will never dine here again. Frankly, I'd rather go to a Chinese supermarket, pick up fresh crab, and season it myself.\n\nnote: I gave it two stars because zero is not possible. The 2nd star is for sentimental reasons.

It's also very loud and chaotic.  Feels more like a neighborhood eating joint with the cramped tables and noisy atmosphere.  \n\nThe service was kinda lacking.

It was still good but right off the bat I noticed mine was room temperature.  Unlike Crustaceans at Thanh Long the crab comes out of the kitchen in record time.   All night servers came out literally by the second, with the roast crab.  With as fast as they were bringing it out, it's easy to assume they were cooked before you ordered it. \n\nThe garlic noodles were great though, not overly greasy and great garlic flavor and portion.  I also liked their shrimp toast, as an appetizer but the calamari was forgettable.  \n\nThe main disappointment was in their dessert selection.  I was undecided and the waitress suggested I try the fried banana, which of course every other Asian restaurant offers.  At Thanh Long was probably the worst (and I've never had a fried banana I didn't like).  The banana- to-dough ratio was waaayyy off.  Too much dough.

I've made the garlic roasted for us at home but it never quite measures up. There must be a secret ingredient of some sort. Maybe the secret is those plastic bibs they give you.

Seasonal veggies are good too, although sometimes they taste just like the beef. Must use the same sauce or at least the same spices.\n\nParking is definitely the only sucky part.

It used to be an old diner style setup with linoleum tile and mint green paint on the walls. They had simple tables and chairs. Back then they were relatively unknown, it was more a local place than the bay area famous and now expanded multi location family run business. (If you didn't know, the kids run the Crustacean's chain, with locations in SF, Beverly Hills and Las Vegas).\n\nOne day my friends and I had decided to go to Thahn Long's for dinner. Much to our horror they were boarded up and a sign said \"closed for remodeling\". It was really sad! We were so looking forward to the best damn crab on earth! \n\nNearly a year later they re-opened and to astonishment Thanh Long has become a very fancy place. They even had a dress code! Which they have done away with...which I think was a bad idea. The food is awesome, not one bad thing on the menu. But from time to time when I go there. I feel like I'm surrounded by the entourage of a ghetto rap star. People come in wearing track suits, shorts and sports jerseys or just jeans and a tshirt. Which really makes things awkward considering everyone else is dress casual, business attire or suit and tie/dress. Thanh Long has definitely become an upscale restaurant. I think it's kind of a shame that they don't require a dress code anymore. \n\n\nOK back to the food. \n\nI like to take friends and family to Thanh Long's who have never been before. I make sure that their first time they get the roasted crab....an ENTIRE roasted crab for themselves. I often see a table of four people get only ONE CRAB for all four of them! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!!! \n\nWhen you go to Thanh Long you HAVE TO GET ONE CRAB for each person. You will ALWAYS....ALWAYS want more. \n\nI've been several time in recent memory where I've been sat next to other tables of two and been just put to SHAME! When you go to Thanh Long for crab you usually want to eat it in a relatively short period of time so the juices don't cool down and harden on the plate. I usually make it ....but in the last few times I've been....I've seen younger smaller asian girls and even older asian women eat an ENTIRE crab for themselves in 20 minutes! Talk about jaw dropping shame and humiliation HAHAHAHAHA They just SCARFED the crab.....and they had DESSERT and were done and paid the bill in under an hour. That folks are SKILLS!\n\nGarlic noodles are to die for. Creme Brulee is one of the best I've had. I've had Creme Brulee in Paris and it wasn't as good.\n\nI've been to Crustaceans here in SF....the food is good but the recipe is slightly different. I prefer the original Thanh Long.

"], "author": "Grace K.", "review": "I have heard about Thanh Long forever, but had never been until this night.  I knew they were a sister restaurant to Crustacean, but I have never been there either - though I have eaten their crab.\n\nThis restaurant is known for their \"roasted crab\" - and on this evening, Rob and I ordered an exorbitant amount of food.  As I gawked at what he was ordering, he said, \"Well we will reheat the leftovers for tomorrow.\"\n\nMade perfect sense to me!\n\nFirst, we ordered a bottle of Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($50).  We thought it'd pair nicely with all the dishes, and it did.  \n\nWe ordered salt and pepper calamari for an appetizer, got shaking beef, sea bass, garlic noodles, and roasted crab.\n\nI thought the calamari was excellent - lightly breaded, fried perfectly and while it's a deep-fried item, you don't feel like a hog eating this up.  Then came the garlic noodles - which was served along with the shaking beef and sea bass.  The noodles were outstanding - perfectly cooked and seasoned, tons of garlic (almost too much for my taste) and full of flavor.  The shaking beef was extremely \"Americanized\", if you will, being entirely too sweet for my palate, but it was good beef and went nicely with the noodles.  Sea bass, in my opinion, is a hard fish to mess up as it basically tastes great however you cook it as long as it's not overdone.  It does, however, need to be dressed up to really make the flavor stand out, or it risks being a bland fish.  While there was nothing wrong with how they cooked it - -  it was one of the few times I thought sea bass to be boring.  It needed a kick of some sort - desperately.\n\nThe crab arrives - and we dug right in.  The flavor was good, and it was served piping hot in a soup which consisted basically of butter.  Can't ask for more.  The crab itself was covered in pepper.  To say one will have to get messy is an understatement.  \n\nHaving said that - I don't consider this to be any better than Crustacean's crab.  Furthermore, perhaps because I have gone crabbing myself and had the freshest Dungeoness Crab one would eat straight out of the ocean and steamed alive on the spot - - it never crossed my mind that this was \"THE BEST\" I have had.  Very good - yes.  The best - - not quite!\n\nIt almost embarrasses me to report that not only did we finish every single thing we ordered - we hemmed and hawed over whether we should order one more crab.  After a few minutes, we did, and therein lied our mistake - - we waited too long to order and got fuller by the minute.  We ate about one leg each off the crab and packed the rest for home.  Well, at least we did have leftovers, like we intended.\n\nService was what was exceptional at this restaurant.  In particular, I am referring to our server - a young man who was the epitome of polite, attentive, friendly but professional all at the same time.  The few times we asked for anything - he got it immediately, and the rest of the time, we never needed a thing because he took such good care of us.  I was also impressed when he didn't bat an eye at how much food we ordered.\n\nYes, we ordered dessert.  (Don't forget, it's Rob and Grace here...)  Initially, Rob declined dessert but seriously, how does one refuse this:\n\n\"FRIED BANANA A LA MODE\"?\n\nWe ordered that and two Vietnamese Iced Coffees - - both were OUTSTANDING and a perfect grand finale to a gluttonous feast.\n\nThe meal was not cheap by any means - but it was a lot of food and we left happy.  The total bill closed in on $300 by the time we tipped.  \n\nWe had some plans to check out a few bars after dinner, making it a full date night.  The food comas that followed the meal prevented any outings and we headed straight home.  \n\nIn summary, Thanh Long is worth trying at least once.  While the ambiance is not \"romantic\" by any means, it's not grungy either.  It's ideal for a Sunday night family dinner (if you have reservations) or dinner with close friends.  It's nice for a casual date, but not quite up to \"impress the socks off\" level, if you know what I mean.  But with great service and good food, not to mention a pretty nice wine list, I am declaring that Thanh Long makes it onto my date list on Yelp.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-07-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Garlic noodles, GOOD!

We have our regular dishes that we always order and have never been let down...year after year.\n\nRecently, we came for dinner mid-week, anticipating the same great experience and meal we usually get but had  a very rude awakening. \n\nFirst, we witnessed the male host/manager (whom we never seen before) treat a customer very rudely. A pregnant lady had let the male host know that they had a reservation and provided the name. He looked up the name and asked if she had a reservation, she said \"yes\". And he asked again, she said the name, he affirmed the name and asked AGAIN if they had a reservation. She again replied \"yes\". It was so bizarre that I was tempted to intervene and maybe help the host understand that she said \"yes, she has a reservation\". We were at the bar and could clearly hear him asking the same question over and over. And she was clearly saying yes they have a reservation under the name he said. Then he told her to wait until her husband showed up. WTF. Strange that he didn't just seat them. The place was not crowded nor was there anyone waiting to be seated. He definitely lacked basic customer service skills. And the owner should be ashamed that their host yelled a pregnant lady who was just wanting to be seated. \n\nThat was them. Now us...\nService was decent. It was not busy at all so we got our food quickly.\nWe ordered our usual appetizers: mussels and the shrimp toast. Mussels were great. The Shrimp Toast was garbage. Toast was not toasted and the shrimp was like rubber. \n\nMain course: Roasted crabs for everyone. The crabs were dry and the flavor was slightly off. All of us felt the same disappointment with our crab. Not the juicy succulent crabs they used to have. Could it be it was out of season? But that never affected the quality of their crabs in past years.\n\nGarlic Noodles: This is always a winner, except for this day. The noodles used to be flavorful, tasty and long. The noodles we got were shorter than usual (or cut up) and the flavor was not evenly distributed. It's like the noodles weren't mixed thoroughly and the sauce was missing something.

We got there, and it was pretty empty...with maybe 20 diners at about 5-6 different tables.  Barren compared to when Anhie T. and I came about 2 yrs ago.  We were seated immediately, and looked over the menu, and ordered the following:\n\nCrispy Rice Paper Roll ($7.50) - your standard Vietnamese Egg Roll.  But here you get once egg roll cut into four pieces.\nThanh Long Mussells ($10.95) - five mussells served with five slices of thin garlic bread.  This dish was delicious.\nSteamed Sea Bass ($24.95) - sea bass was flaky, moist, and really good.  The sauce was sweet and gingery.\nStuffed Calamari ($15.95) - lots of calamari stuffed with minced meat in a tomato based sauce.  Parents didn't like it so much, but I thought it was okay.\nShaken Beef ($20.95) - very flavorful, and a dish that everyone loved.  The beef was tender and potatoes were flavorful.\nGarlic Noodles (2 orders at $9.50 ea) - Garlicky and delicious! \nRoast Crab (I think it was $38) - really good crab...but compared to Crustaceans, it's not the same.  Not as flavorful, but still very, very good nonetheless. \nCreme Brulee (2 orders) - My dad and Anhie T. thought this was the best dessert dish.\nBanana Cake - I liked this dish and everyone else didn't like it.  Served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, a dallop of whip cream, this cake seemed to be made out of only bananas.  Anhie T. said it was bland.  I disagree.\nHot Chocolate Cake - served with Vanilla ice cream...this was good.  Really rich though.\nCoke (2 glasses) - served from their bar in a tall, slim glass.  No free refills.\n\nTotal bill with tax + tip came out to $218.\n\nThis was my parents first time here and they loved the crab, and garlic noodles.  They did say it was a bit oily, but c'mon, roasted crab and garlic noodles anywhere is a bit oily.  But here's a good sign.  As they left, they took some business cards.  That means they liked their food and they'll be back...probably with some family friends!\n\nDepending on my the mood (and thickness of the wallet), I would come back.  \n\nBut other substitutions are very comparable:  PPQ is cheaper and quality isn't far behind, while Crustacean is a tad more expensive, but swankier....\n\nTip 'o the day:  Avoid the valet parking outside.  Parking isn't too difficult in the Sunset.

Would be better if you add a little sliced chilli and sautee it with the garlic to before stir frying the noodle.  Ok, all that for 9.5 bucks?  Pretty ridiculous aye.\n\nThe drunken crab... you shouldn't put that much liquid into steaming the crab.  The crab itself has a lot of flavors that can come out naturally.  It's seriously, just a bit of cheap white wine + pepper... 35 bucks?  Chardonnay?  Damn, you should use Fa Tiu instead\n\nLastly, we have the JUMBO tiger prawns.  Jumbo my ass.

The crab tastes kind of bland, however, the crab comes in a whole, not cut up. One good thing about the crab is that the flesh does not stick to the shell like PPQ's crab. The crab is overpriced considering that you will get the same result if you just steam crabs at home and make butter sauce with pepper dipping.\nPPQ's peppercorn crab is very delicious. I believe the crab is deep fried, then seasoned with sauteed garlic pieces, peppercorn, and spices. However, the crab is cut up, so you won't be able to see the crab in a whole, in case if the crab is missing a leg.\nThanh Long's garlic noodle is delicious however, it does not have any garlic pieces. Instead, they use garlic powder-infused oil. You can just go to Costco buy a big jar of McCormick garlic powder and buy cheap noodle at Ranch 99. $ 9.50 is overpriced.\nPPQ's garlic noodle has garlic pieces in it and it's priced at reasonable $6.50.\nI will not go back to Thanh Long for their peppercorn crab. I would rather spend the money for PPQ's peppercorn crab for the same amount of money (actually PPQ's is a buck cheaper - and BETTER)\n\nThe following weekend, I decided to give the tamarind crab a try. It was worse than their peppercorn crab. It lacked seasoning. For what its name, \"tamarind\", I hardly tasted the tamarind. I even thought the sauce tasted kind of like sweet and sour sauce from chinese takeout.\nThe crab flesh really didn't have flavor. Might as well I buy cooked dungeness crab from Albertsons and dip it in sweet and sour sauce for less than 10 bucks!\n$5.99/lb crab with oyster sauce from Manila Oriental Market on King Dr. would even do better for the taste and the wallet.\n\nThe secret recipe - kept in the vault - Thanh Long claim really does not live up to my expectation.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-05-21"}, {"excerpts": ["the course...roasted garlic crab which you finish to the last drop smothered in that peppery garlic sauce paired with white rice eaten filipino style with your hands or garlic noodles that add even more richness to your crab....if you have the chance to take a sip, order a La Crema Chardonnay which adds a buttery flavor making your meal complete....\n\n"], "author": "Carissa Noelle G.", "review": "i grew up in this restaurant- from when it started as hole in the wall with hour long waits and now has become a new city on its own...although the crab long wait to crawl into your mouth....you have to try the chicken or crab WHITE asparagus soup which is sweet to the taste, and the crispy spicy and sweet vermicelli rolls and then on the main the course...roasted garlic crab which you finish to the last drop smothered in that peppery garlic sauce paired with white rice eaten filipino style with your hands or garlic noodles that add even more richness to your crab....if you have the chance to take a sip, order a La Crema Chardonnay which adds a buttery flavor making your meal complete....\n\nyou cant leave without trying fried banana with vanilla ice cream...yes i do leave lots of room before i come to make sure i am getting everything worth my money and time...\n\nthis place is a fun laid back spot, if you want upscale try crustaceans, but you wont get a better experience than at thank long....service is always on top, but it gets really busy here so make reservations, and parking can also be a pain, but you will need the walk after a long meal....\n\nsan francisco is the place to be....", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-08-08"}, {"excerpts": ["I went with a friend for dinner and we split a huge, delicious roasted crab and an order of garlic noodles.

", "Dessert: "], "author": "Violet N.", "review": "I've been going to Thanh Long for as long as I can remember. Over 5 years for sure and because of my frequent visits, majority of the staff knows my name and most of them know exactly what I'd usually order... scary I know, but I love it.\n\nI'm giving Thanh Long 5 stars because I feel that the overall experience is great. With a casual atmosphere, cozy modern Asian decor, a wide variety of French/Vietnamese inspired dishes and an amazing friendly staff, it is always a joy to come here. \n\nMust Haves: \n1. Appetizers - Thanh Long Mussels\n2. Entree: Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles. \n    (Large enough portion for two)\n3. Dessert: Vanilla Creme Brulee\n\nPros: This place might look small, but it can seat a ton of people so if you are looking for a great place to host your birthday dinner or celebration dinner, they can accommodate you. Make sure you make reservations at least a month ahead of time.\n\nCons: Parking is horrible, but that's because everyone wants to eat here. To save yourself from wanting to hit every car that is already parked with the bat that is in your trunk because you're annoyed from circling around for the 500th time... Park valet. Make sure you tip the valet guys good because these guys are outside in the cold, for who knows how long, to park your car while you're inside the warm restaurant ready to eat some amazing crab. Another con would probably be that the bar area is extremely small and since it's pretty much combined with the waiting area, being as crowded as it is, you'll feel like you're in a packed dance club trying to get a drink.  Better to wait outside.\n\nAdvice: Make sure you have a reservation, especially during weekends and holidays. It's just for convenience because you don't want to go to the restaurant with a group of people or a date after it took you about an hour or so to find parking and then find out that you would have to wait another hour and half before you get sat. Walk-ins do exist and if you do decide to go that route, you'll probably be waiting around for quite awhile drooling as you watch other people enjoy their meal.\n\nMajor Advice: If you don't like getting your hands dirty, you'd probably want to skip this restaurant. This place is known for their roasted crab and with that being said people... you eat crab with your freaking hands!! So for you dainty girls who are scared to get dirty... this place isn't for you! Eating the crab here is the whole fun experience because you can be in a nice restaurant and still be able to get down and dirty without feeling embarrassed. If you decide to come to this restaurant to dine on anything else but the crab... than you should just choose another freaking restaurant. By you doing that, it's like you deciding to go to a burger joint to order a salad... What the heck!? Don't get me wrong, all of their other dishes are great, but you have to at least order the crab... any crab. If you've already tasted the crab and came back to try the other dishes... please do so because they're just as delicious.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-02-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I always order the roast crab and garlic noodles ", "and I'm always soooooo satisfied!!!!!!

Everyone knows the best part is the crab fat you scoop out from the inside of the shell, not just the wimpy-ass legs. \nAll in all, this is a pretty pricey place to eat in, but the meal itself is quite fun and the atmosphere is not stuffy. I take some strange kind of perverted delight in the cracking sound of flying shells and watching grease congeal from my hands onto my 7th bottle of '33'(pretty sure that was the beer I drank).

The Parents are notoriously picky about food and the Dad is particularly so when it comes to crab. It has to be fresh, can't be over-seasoned and has to be meaty. Thank goodness for Thanh Long. We ordered the mango salad, Dungeness crab puffs, ginger calamari, Drunken Crab, Roast Crab and the garlic rice. The Boyfriend and I had heard that people loved the garlic noodles but the Parents didn't like the looks of it so the Boyfriend and I again followed the advice of our friend and ordered some garlic rice. In terms of food, Thanh Long gets five stars. The Parents loved the food. The ginger calamari was well-seasoned, not too gingery and not too salty. It was particularly yummy with the pineapples. The mango salad was delicious (it has shrimp and scallops as well) and the garlic rice was flavorful without being overpowering. The Dungeness crab puffs were a big hit but pricey. It was basically a tastier version of crab rangoon. Now for the crab: right before ordering, the Boyfriend and I faithfully checked Yelp and some had said that the Roast Crab was too salty. The Dad isn't too fond of wine-reduction so we tried the Roast Crab first. It was delicious and not too salty at all. The waiter comes over with plastic bibs and you get to cracking (well...the Boyfriend and the Dad got to cracking and then fed the Mom and me bits and pieces). One crab is about enough for one person to be full. One crab is about enough to make two grown men half-full so calculate accordingly. We ordered the Drunken Crab to mix things up and it was also good. It tastes much more Asian in that the wine reduction really saves the flavor of the crab - it's much more crabby than the Roast crab which is more seasoned. The Dad and the Boyfriend liked the Roast Crab a little better, though, so if you want to choose one, I'd advise the Roast Crab. Don't worry about messy/crabby hands. The waitstaff comes by with hot (caution: extremely hot) warm towels for you to towel off between and after crab eating. Finally, for dessert, we ordered orange sorbet. It's really cute - it comes in a frozen orange that's been beheaded and the lemon sorbet comes in a frozen lemon that's been beheaded! The only reason I won't give Thanh Long is that the prices are a bit high.

Alas! that was not to be. \ntaste: it's like eating tasty garlic bread.- yes, it quite literally tasted like garlic bread. buT, texture wise, it was quite disgusting. the noodles are way way way over cooked. and as someone who likes their pasta well-done... if i think it's over cooked, then X_X \ngarlic noodles:: it's like eating super extra soggy garlic bread. \n\nthe garlic rice wasn't anything to write home about either. there's so much garlic in everything else, you might as well get white rice since the garlic in the garlic rice is minimal. and at $7.50 for the equivalent of 1.75ricebowls!! outrage! \n\nfried banana a la mode was very yummy. the bananas weren't over battered or anything. nice and hot.  this dish wasn't the most aesthetically appetizing, but it was good (then again i'm partial to fried bananas, and it's a dish that is difficult to truly mess up) \n\nthe service was really good, the waiters/servers etc were all really friendly. they're really good about changing out your shell bowls. \n\nover all ambiance is nice and they have a full bar.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Garlic rice: just pungent enough, wonderfully textured and sticky, enhanced all the other dishes.\n\n"], "author": "John Z.", "review": "File this review under the \"interesting\" or \"odd\" folders at your discretion ... but I may be the only reviewer of Thanh Long who didn't have the crab or garlic noodles. \n\nAll the more reason to go back. The place is great, the meal the most memorable I've had in months.\n\nTo begin with: a full bar, which was nice for us martini-files. Began the meal with two starters:  the seafood dumplings and the shrimp toast. The dumplings: pleasant, light, delicate. More a tease than filling, but a nice tease.  The shrimp toast:  wow.  I've had countless versions as an former ny-er but this was a whole new trip. Lighter but still flavorful -- on slices of biegnet, a nice tip of the hat to the French influence of Vietnamese food.\n\nThen the main meal: Shaken beef, tender and succulent in its not-too-sweet sauce with a surprisingly perfect compliment of potatoes. Spicy eggplant, just spicy/savory enough to let the eggplant shine through.  Seasonal vegetables: mostly sugar snap peas, lots of mushrooms, absolutely wonderful. Now mind you I don't like mushrooms as a rule but I would have been happy to scarf these down anytime. Garlic rice: just pungent enough, wonderfully textured and sticky, enhanced all the other dishes.\n\nYes a little on the pricey side... and valet service is ten bucks, not five (thankfully we got street parking). Service was gentle and professional.\n\nI relished every bite and look forward to returning to see about those crabs and garlic noodles.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-06-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The garlic rice!

I'd never had butter garlic crab elsewhere and the flavor was just too good! I'm guessing they steam the crab with salt, pepper, and garlic infused butter (as there's always glops of salt on top making some bites super salty). The sauce the crab comes in is just butter infused with garlic (I have yet to see garlic chunks anywhere...) which is good for dipping, but I think the crab itself has enough flavor. The garlic noodles are interesting to say the least -- every time I get them they are cold, so I don't know if they are supposed to be that way. The noodles are slightly sweet and no as garlicy as the crab... it just seems out of place to me as I am eating fresh hot crab with cold noodles. I've also had their garlic rice (obviously not as novel), which I like better than the noodles, probably just because it's warm and hence doesn't have a temperature difference with the star of the show. \n\nTheir vegetables are delicious! I didn't think I'd be ordering veggies at a seafood restaurant, but their string beans are cooked and seasoned perfectly with seasonable vegetables and a variety of mushrooms (yum!).\n\nThe most recent time I came the crab was not fresh - we were charged $40/crab (yes I know it's seasonal) and the flesh was not fresh. One person in our party even ended up with diarrhea the next day =/\n\nService is horrible... waitresses never come around. The place is ALWAYS crowded, and even when we had a reservation we had to wait 30 minutes (what is up with that?!) \n\nPPQ vs Thanh Long\nSo I find PPQ better and more price worthy. At PPQ you can get a full 4 course meal (appetizer, crab, noodles, dessert) for about $60. The crab and garlic noodles themselves are equally priced between the two, but PPQ offers a set menu which makes it more reasonable. The crab is different as it doesn't have much flavor itself, but the garlic butter sauce is WAY BETTER! There's garlic chunks in the sauce, making it all the more rich and savory.

My roasted crab was pretty good, but it lacked garlic and was more peppery and salty (and greasy af). My garlic noodles were good but not as good as I remember them being.

My hometown, Nha Trang, was even labeled on the menu cover. :-) Then, the waiters tied a bib on me and walked away with a knowing look. We started with the salmon carpaccio and the shrimp toast. The salmon was sliced thinly enough to hold full flavor and the citrus hit was perfect. The shrimp toast was pillow goodness. The topping reminded me of the shrimp paste around sugar cane.\n\nThen the garlic noodles! So good! Best when eaten hot, so get it on your plate then into your belly fast. The noodles were a nice chewy texture and a subtle garlic flavor that was nothing as powerful as its garlic aroma. Then again, you're hit with garlic the moment you walk in.\n\nThen...THE CRAB! Some of the best Dungeoness crab I've ever eaten. My table ordered the roasted crab and tamarind crab. Very different. Very satisfying. I paused for a split second to be thankful all my hair was already tied up. No one at my table ate their crab carapaces, so this Vietnamese gal was in heaven with five all to herself! Then, we went garlic crazy and ordered garlic fried rice. The tamarind crab went great with it.\n\nAfter all this, I had a disappointing fried banana. Others had the orange sherbet and the molten lava cake and enjoyed their desserts. My fried banana had no hint of a sugar finish...brown, white, nor palm.

This family-owned and operated gem of a place has some of the best seafood (crab, prawns and garlic noodles - yes, please!) in the city.\n \nI had an 8:15 p.m. reservation for a party of 10 (close friends and family). If you're familiar with the city, then you know this place is located allllll the way in the Avenues, so it can take up to an hour to get to in rush hour traffic. I arrived extremely late to find everyone in my party seated and waiting for me, which I appreciated, as the restaurant was pretty full. They could've bumped my table or refused to seat my guests, but they did not. Kudos for that.\n \nSince it had been awhile, I wanted some of everything on the menu and my guests thankfully obliged me. We ordered several whole roast Dungeness crabs in their special garlic seasoning. I rarely order Dungeness crab anywhere else because not everyone cleans and cooks it properly, but at Thanh Long, it is a MUST. It was delicious, just like I remembered! It's also very filling with everything else. I ended up splitting half of mine with my godsister. The sides are a la carte, so we also ordered the garlic noodles, shrimp fried rice, garlic toast and the seasonal vegetable saut\u00e9 to go with our crab. My mom ordered her usual tiger prawns over garlic noodles. (The four prawns come butterflied over the noodles). She refused to let me have a taste, so I assume it was as good as she remembered, too. For those who may not like crab or shrimp like one of my friends, the mango salad is recommended - without the scallops or shrimps, of course. As far as libations go, they have a full bar and decent cocktails. I only had Goose on the rocks with two limes, so I can't comment on the other drinks.\n \nIf you don't like garlic, this is not the place for you.

Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order. The prawns did have a tendency to stick to their shells, but they were perfectly done and marinated in some fantastic sauce to make them outstanding.\n\nThe Garlic noodles had the perfect consistency of Yee Noodles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_mein, which gives them an extra nice bite and appear to absorb the flavors better. They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Next the fried rice seafood  combo was the bomb!!

Crisp, no sauce.\n\nASPARAGUS SOUP WITH CRAB $7.50: My mom ordered this and enjoyed it. Hot soup is always great when the weather is cold. \n\nROAST/DRUNKEN/TAMARIND CRAB: We got one of each ($41.95 per crab). My favorite was the drunken crab. The sauce actually doesn't matter unless you dip the crab meat in the sauce on the plate. \n\nGARLIC NOODLES $10: This was actually really good, but I wouldn't say they're to die for. It was like eating garlic bread except they were noodles, and these noodles are the same texture as the chow mein at Panda Express.

"], "author": "Ada C.", "review": "Mixed feelings about Thanh Long, after reading all the awesome reviews about this place, I had high expectations as I made reservations for a party of 5 on a Friday night. \n\nUpon arrival, we were immediately greeted and seated. Customer service was pretty on point, the waiter was friendly and attentive. He memorized our order (which was quite a few items) without writing it down, but sadly forgot one of the appetizers. All good, since I'm sure we over ordered anyways.\n\nOur dinner consisted of one of each of the soups, salt and pepper calamari, collasal tiger prawns over garlic noodles, lemongrass chicken, vegetarian entree, chicken fried rice, and an extra order of garlic noodles. Although the serving size wasn't as big as we had pictured, this was more than enough for the 5 of us, so in retrospect, the serving size was pretty decent.\n\nOut of all the soups, we all voted that the vegetarian soup was the best. Something about the clear broth and the assorted veggies just made it more refreshing versus the creamy aspargus chowder or the chicken vermecelli soup.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari was good as well, served sizzling hot, with a good combination of salt AND pepper, but for a couple of the outlying pieces, there was definitely a lot more salt than pepper. \n\nAs for the entrees, it was pretty mediocre, not fabulous, but not disgusting or unedible. There was just nothing outstanding about the meal. The main dish I liked the most was the collasal tigerl prawns over garlic noodles. The noodles were seasoned to perfection and it got my whole family scooping for more. The prawns were pretty good as well, although I could definitely taste the layer of butter in between those suckers. However, I'm not too sure how to justify 4 pieces of prawn over a bed of garlic noodles for 37 bucks. Seems a little bit outrageous.. pretentious to some.\n\nAgain, like I said, the meal wasn't bad, but for the price of the dishes, I was expecting something more amazing. Overall, a good dining experience, food was pretty good, glad I tried it once, but nothing coaxing me to be back for another round.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-06-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Crab, fried rice, garlic noodles and mango salad.\n\n", "The mango salad was nice.

So if a restaurant gets this rating from me, they deserve it.  Hands down, flat out, case closed, done dig-giddy dada (I know... just go with the moment).\n\nI've heard a lot about Thanh Long and looked forward to trying it.  I got the opportunity when in the Bay area this past weekend.\n\nI've been an advocate for \"hole in the wall\" restaurants over chains because 1. I think the food most of time tastes a lot better and 2. The intimacy of a small establishment caters to my \"less crowd, less noise\" mantra.\n\nFrom the outside, Thanh Long does not look impressive.  But when you notice a flood of people going in and coming out either something illegal is happening or they have really good food.  Thanh Long has really, really, good food.\n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and my hats off to the bartender.  I'm not a big drinker at all.  That said, I think every person should have a signature drink.  For me, it's Drambuie.  Because it's not an average drink and only consumed by the most worldly of people (ah-em), I can tell instantly the status of a restaurant when I order it and the waiter says \"huh, what's that?\"  Or the bartender simply smiles and says, \"I'm sorry sir, we don't have that.\"  He knows that you know, the sophistication of their restaurant is FOS at that point.\n\nThanh Long serves Drambuie.  I'm just saying.\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate - just how I like it.  \n\nWe ordered the Crab, fried rice, garlic noodles and mango salad.\n\nThe mango salad was nice.  Teased ever so gently with shrimp and thick cuts of mango.  I didn't care for it being slightly warmed, but I didn't mind either.\n\nThe fried rice was delicate, delicious and just amazing.  The garlic noodles were awesome.  The next time I go to Panda and they're talking \"garlic noodles,\" I think I'm going to just call the police.  Thanh Long's garlic noodles are by far the best I've ever had.\n\nThe Crab, unless you don't like getting your hands dirty, then you need to order something else.  Steamed in pepper and other seasoning with just enough of a buttery hint that I was sitting at the table licking my fingers.  Yeah, I know. No table etiquette, but at that point I didn't care.  And if you're wondering, it was so good I would have ate the shell.\n\nI'll be going back to the Bay area in another month and I'm already making reservations for round 2 at Thanh Long.\n\nWhat better way to acknowledge their food is that good.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-04-08"}, {"excerpts": ["spent 200 on 2 crabs,  1 garlic noodles , 1 fried rice,  for 2 adults and 2 kids.

The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.

Don't bother to order the garlic toast which is tasteless, dry and cold.Dinner was the butterfly shrimp and garlic noodle and the shrimp was beautifully grilled and tasteful , but the garlic noodle was tasteless and barely warm followed by the Cubed steak which again sat on an overwhelming amount of lettuce with a few potatoes and onions. The steak was sweet and would of been better left just grilled. Then the piece of resistance the garlic crab which was nothing spectacular and the garlic noodles which were tasteless and cold. We then ordered desert hoping they could redeem themselves and that was a joke. We ordered the Chocolate lava cake accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that had no lava gushing and looked like a flat dried out brownie. The cheesecake creme brulee had no brulee. At this point, I returned both desserts out of complete disappointment. Five people and $398.00 later walked out hungry and will never return.", "rating": 1, "date": "2018-03-16"}, {"excerpts": ["The sides are a la carte, so we also ordered the garlic noodles, shrimp fried rice, garlic toast and the seasonal vegetable saut\u00e9 to go with our crab.

I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here on 5/26/15 and I am pleased to say that even though it had been over a decade since my last visit, the service and food have not changed! This family-owned and operated gem of a place has some of the best seafood (crab, prawns and garlic noodles - yes, please!) in the city.\n \nI had an 8:15 p.m. reservation for a party of 10 (close friends and family). If you're familiar with the city, then you know this place is located allllll the way in the Avenues, so it can take up to an hour to get to in rush hour traffic. I arrived extremely late to find everyone in my party seated and waiting for me, which I appreciated, as the restaurant was pretty full. They could've bumped my table or refused to seat my guests, but they did not. Kudos for that.\n \nSince it had been awhile, I wanted some of everything on the menu and my guests thankfully obliged me. We ordered several whole roast Dungeness crabs in their special garlic seasoning. I rarely order Dungeness crab anywhere else because not everyone cleans and cooks it properly, but at Thanh Long, it is a MUST. It was delicious, just like I remembered! It's also very filling with everything else. I ended up splitting half of mine with my godsister. The sides are a la carte, so we also ordered the garlic noodles, shrimp fried rice, garlic toast and the seasonal vegetable saut\u00e9 to go with our crab. My mom ordered her usual tiger prawns over garlic noodles. (The four prawns come butterflied over the noodles). She refused to let me have a taste, so I assume it was as good as she remembered, too. For those who may not like crab or shrimp like one of my friends, the mango salad is recommended - without the scallops or shrimps, of course. As far as libations go, they have a full bar and decent cocktails. I only had Goose on the rocks with two limes, so I can't comment on the other drinks.\n \nIf you don't like garlic, this is not the place for you. And if you are price conscious, this is not the place for you LOL! They do accept walk-ins depending on how busy they are. The place is not huge, so just phone ahead and reserve whenever possible. Street parking is available, but the surrounding area is residential so it may be hard to come by. Valet is $12. Not bad for San Francisco.\n \nFor me, the only downside is living out-of-state, but I would recommend this place for special occasions.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Had calamari appetizers and garlic toast and a beer.

Everybody raves about the Garlic noodles, and they were pretty darn good but to tell you the truth, all it is is just a plate of plain noodles, skinny like spaghetti noodles with nothing else!  Maybe if there was chicken or some kind of vegetable with it I would have found it more appealing and I'd be raving about it.  \nI did find that the Roast crab was amazing however!  One of the best crab dishes I have EVER had.  It is however also the messiest crab I have ever eaten.  Even messier than a crab feed. haha  The entire crab is drenched in garlic butter sauce so your hands and face are guaranteed to be slippery and completely messy with all the goodness.  You have to crack the crab yourself so be sure to wear the provided bib or else you'll get sauce or pieces of crab all over you.  I ate one and a half crabs which took me a good hour to crack and eat.  And it was totally worth it.  We also had the garlic toast, which was ok, it was just small thin pieces of sourdough bread toast with garlic butter. ha! so much garlic and butter in this restaurant your breath will be kickin' it for days!!

The decor and service was awesome but the food was just okay in terms of taste, portions, and price. Very overpriced for the amount you get. It was about $40/person for us but I felt like I ate $20 worth of food.
