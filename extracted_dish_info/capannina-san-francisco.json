They served it to us in two separate plates, which was a very nice touch.  The fresh pasta was the right texture and cooked perfectly.  It stayed warm until the bottom.  I think they heated their plates too, which is awesome.  Temperature makes such a difference when eating pasta!  The sauce was delicious, but not jaw-droppingly spectacular.  We couldn't tell the tiny pieces of ground meat were boar...is there a supposed to be a difference in flavor?  We couldn't detect it.  It could have been lean ground beef.\n\nWe also got one of their specials: veal shank (ossobuco).  It was plated with polenta.  Pretty good, but it could have been more tender.  I'm being very nit picky here!  The thicker areas didn't seem to have absorbed the flavor of the broth.  It might have been rushed, since they were so busy and we had a time constraint.  BF was unhappy that there wasn't any marrow.  The pieces we got had rather narrow bones.

Now, I normally wouldn't have ordered what I did because I try to stay away from mushrooms (it's an aversion with fungus directly atttributed to Mr. Hill's 9th grade biology class), but I couldn't turn away from trying wild boar.  The dish was definitely delicious...the boar had a nice texture to it and a slightly different flavor from what I am used to.  Hubby's ravioli didn't interest me as much because I felt like it was a bit too cheesy/saucy, which just isn't my thing.  But he certainly loved it - bufalo mozzarella and prosciutto is like heaven to him.\n\nI think that Round 2 was a draw.\n\nRound Three\n\nI'm not even going to try to compare these dishes.
