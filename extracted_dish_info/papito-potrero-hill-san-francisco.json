I ordered a super burrito, which came with Spanish rice, black beans, pico de gallo, monterey jack cheese, guacamole, and sour cream, and I paid extra to add shrimp inside.

So far, we were pretty underwhelmed. \n\nWe moved onto the burritos, which my boyfriend even commented, \"looked like a small baby.\" They were pretty large, and definitely well-stuffed.

I came in and after seeing 4 names ahead of me and a full house, I decided to order take-out. The solo waitress was on the phone, rushing here and there and it took ~20 minutes before she took my order. I had to stand awkwardly by the kitchen which was literally ~3x5ft or smaller (they had 2 chefs and 1 dish washer). I asked for a duck confit regular burrito (the super burrito included avocado and sour cream I think) and she confirmed by asking 'regular burrito?' and I nodded. Turns out, she wrote down 'regular burrito' and no duck confit... What did she think I was doing for the first 3 syllables of my order? I probably should have confirmed back about the duck confit/checked my receipt but it was dark, I was hangry and I thought she wrote it down as I was speaking. \n\nAfterwards, she gave us the check but forgot to take the receipt and was so busy the entire time that we just held the receipt, pen, and everything (basically right in front of her) until we picked up our order ~30 minutes later. \n\nLike I said, the rustic shrimp was amazing--flavors came together, great dynamic, good choice of cheese, but the burrito was the sum of its parts and not mind-blowing.

Odd in the fact that we all know some of the best Mexican to be had in the city is in the well-known holes-in-the-wall in the Mission like El Farolito or Taqueria Vallarta. Only one in the semi-fancy category stands out to me, Colibri near Union Square, but now I can assert that Papito is just about ready to join Colibri in the top echelon. Just a few tweaks here and there, and Papito will become a go-to place beyond Potrero Hill dwellers. I only realized it was there when Genevieve earned Review of the Day about a month ago for her familiar summary of highlights. \n\nI decided it was worth Jamie W. and me returning to his old neighborhood where he readily points out that Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves canoodled in \"Sweet November\". Papito turns out to be around the corner from 18th on Connecticut next door to Rocketfish. It's a rinky-dink space but nicely appointed. It was a shivery evening, so we weren't much for waiting. Luckily, two seats opened up at the curve of the counter next to the window. It was a tight squeeze for the young girls at the end of the counter, but we all fit somehow. \n\nSo I knew it was \"upscale\" when they didn't lay down a basket of chips automatically. No, I ordered the $6 Guacamole Papito, which afforded us fresh tortilla chips with some of the most flavorful guacamole I've had in these parts. It had cilantro, serrano peppers, queso fresco, jitomate and lime mixed with the smashed avocados (see photo). Tasty and addictive. Jamie went with the $9 Super Burrito which had duck to go with the rice, beans, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and creme fraiche. For all that, he characterized it as \"pretty good\". Mine was more of a slam dunk, the $8 pair of Carnitas de Pato Tacos, which had duck confit carnitas, homemade pickles, habanero peppers, mint, and chipotle and drizzled with tamarind sauce (see photo). Those were mouthfuls of joy bursting with flavor. \n\nI went overboard and ordered the $10 Carnitas Quesadilla to share (see photo). We were actually hoping they forgot it since it was late coming to the counter, and we were quickly getting stuffed. It was huge and stuffed with Berkshire pork, guajillo salsa roja, shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and a pineapple pico de gallo (see photo). Delicious though we needed to doggie-bag it. That decision allowed us in our self-justified minds to order the $5 Mexican flan, perfectly firm in texture with just the right amount of sweetness from the caramel (see photo).

Maybe the burrito was rolled so that the fillings weren't evenly distributed, but my half had one small strip of duck and was mostly rice & beans.  There was absolutely no duck flavor... actually, there wasn't much flavor to the filling at all.  If I were to rate Papito on the burrito alone, they would've received 2stars.  PL & AD also shared a duck burrito (and a fried chicken burrito), and found it to be \"too sweet\" (I can't confirm, since my burrito was uber bland).  They preferred the fried chicken burrito.\n\n- Quesadilla + duck ($12): SO GOOD.  A fairly large quesadilla stuffed FULL of shredded duck meat, with a smattering of pickled carrots/daikon, refreshing mint, and a sweet tamarind sauce.  I really enjoyed the flavors in this dish-- perfect harmony of savory and sweet.\n\nOVERALL: It is clear dishes at Papito are composed of fresh ingredients.  I just wish they took more care in ensuring every bite has the flavor profile they are aiming for.  I think prices are fair for the food they're offering...

I ordered a super burrito, which came with Spanish rice, black beans, pico de gallo, monterey jack cheese, guacamole, and sour cream, and I paid extra to add shrimp inside. My boyfriend also ordered a super burrito, but opted to add the duck confit in his. We also ordered the homemade guacamole to share. \n\nThe food arrived pretty quickly, and it was hot and fresh upon arrival. The guacamole was good, but we both agreed that it was not worth the $10 we paid for it. We were also disappointed by the tortilla chips that came with it, as they seemed store bought rather than made in house. So far, we were pretty underwhelmed. \n\nWe moved onto the burritos, which my boyfriend even commented, \"looked like a small baby.\" They were pretty large, and definitely well-stuffed.

Mine was more of a slam dunk, the $8 pair of Carnitas de Pato Tacos, which had duck confit carnitas, homemade pickles, habanero peppers, mint, and chipotle and drizzled with tamarind sauce (see photo). Those were mouthfuls of joy bursting with flavor. \n\nI went overboard and ordered the $10 Carnitas Quesadilla to share (see photo). We were actually hoping they forgot it since it was late coming to the counter, and we were quickly getting stuffed. It was huge and stuffed with Berkshire pork, guajillo salsa roja, shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and a pineapple pico de gallo (see photo). Delicious though we needed to doggie-bag it.

Let me establish a few assumptions.\n\n1) We are in San Francisco. Dining is not as cheap as it is in, say, my old local San Diego taco truck. We all knew this going in.\n\n2) This is a restaurant which is serving quality food. I'm not going to expect the flavors (or price, see above) of a greasy 2am burrito. I want something a little nicer.\n\n3) The Potrero neighborhood vibe is intimate -- small, unassuming shops which are routinely packed. This is intentional and good. The waiter is used to locals who enjoy their food, and isn't going to get in my face every 3 minutes about a drink refill. On a Friday night there might be a bit of a wait.\n\nWith that said, /wow/. What a wonderful find. I recently moved to Potrero from Palo Alto, and given the size and decor of the restaurants, I was sure I'd have to spend a small fortune on some overhyped \"gourmet\" portions. In other words, I'd either be frequently cooking at home or frequently guilty at how much of my budget was going to food. Papito, like Chez Maman around the corner, completely broke those preconceived notions. \n\nEverything I've tried has been delicious -- and this is coming from the sort of insufferable guy who always whines about [insert anything north of Los Angeles] Mexican not being up to snuff. The chips and salsa are inventive and wonderful, the calamari addictive, the burritos are uniformly excellent (try the Burrito Mojado with Al Pastor), and the duck confit tacos are out of this world. \n\nThe people are also anything but snobby. The owner clearly loves what he does, and is very friendly. Sit at a table with a friend, or at the bar alone, and have chips and salsa handed to you almost immediately. Service is as quick and attentive as you'd like it -- I can have a leisurely conversation while dining over an hour and a half; or I can get a Corona, an appetizer, and a burrito in under 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, by any reasonable San Francisco standards, the place is CHEAP. If you want to go all out with a beer, appetizer, and dinner, you might be looking at $20. If you just want a world-class burrito that's filling enough to hibernate for another 16 hours, you can do it for $12. No, it isn't a $4 beef-filled doorstop the size of Mark Wahlberg's arm, but is that really what you came to this neighborhood expecting? When compared to just about anything else of quality in the city, it's shockingly reasonable.\n\nGreat food, personal service, grad student prices.

This is a tiny place- only four tables and a counter.  As the tables were full, we sat at the counter,  but it was perfectly enjoyable.  Our service was quick , casual and friendly.  \n\nWe started with the fried calamari, which was some of the best we've ever had.  You know when the calamari you ordered tastes...old?  Like it was fried much earlier in the day and then reheated in an oven?  This calamari was the exact opposite:  it was very fresh and the coating was crisp- nothing soggy, chewy or old tasting about it.  Also, it was mixed with batter dipped and deep fried jalapenos (no heat to them, so I could enjoy them), carrots, and red and green bell peppers- really delicious and sort of like a Mexican tempura.\n\nMy husband and I are big burrito fans- in fact the reason we came to Papito's in the first place was to get a good shrimp burrito.  This is what I had, while my husband had the chorizo burrito.  Neither of us were disappointed; in fact, even though I can eat a lot of men under the table (umm, that did not come out right!), I had to take half of my burrito home, as I was already pretty full from sharing the calamari.\n\nOne really nice point about the burritos- I don't believe that they were steamed as they are at some places.

I arrived there with my boyfriend who had never been there before. We sat down to order our food and were immediately greeted and given water by our server. Too bad this gentleman wasn't our waiter because the gentleman who attempted to fill this role was nothing short of rude. When asked what we'd like to order for starters, we decided on the chorizo queso. The waiter (aka YOU GET NO SOUP!) guy quickly quipped, \"Why don't you order the guacamole. Anything else on the menu will take a long time. I'm just warning you.\" He then quipped, \"You probably should just order everything together so the cooks will know what they need to do\". \n\nQue? Ok, we had no idea what that even meant but we still placed our order for the queso hoping that \"a long time\" meant 5 or 10 minutes. By the way, there were only four people in the restaurant including us and the other two had asked for their check. We pondered the awkward menu for a few minutes deciding on our main course. I use the term awkward due to the menus placement underneath the glass of the table. Add chips, salsa and drinks to your table and good luck even seeing the thing. \n\nAfter deciding on potential main courses we politely asked the waiter for his thoughts. His answer was muddled and incoherent at best. We had no idea what the guy was even saying. However, it was VERY apparent based on his tone and body language that it was pointless to expect anything more than awful service from him. With that duly noted, we exited stage left never even taking a bite of we'd hoped would be delicious queso. \n\nAu Revior Papito!!!!

We were a party of 4 and a half (4 adults and one child age 3), and had to wait a good 20 - 30 minutes for a table to seat us all. I started with a watermelon agua fresca and the housemade guacamole. Both AMAZING and deserving of all caps. The guacamole was perfectly prepared and not overly salty (like at some taco shops) and the watermelon agua fresca was like they popped a hole in a watermelon and poured it straight into my glass. It's by far my new favorite drink and I look forward to finding a San Diego shop that can rival the flavor. \n\nWe also shared the elote (grilled corn) appetizer that was griled perfectly and slathered in a delicious mayo/butter glaze with a side of lime and chile seasonings. Total Perfection.\n\nI didn't think it could get much better than the corn, but the camarones (shrimp) in the camarones quesadilla were so plump, juicy, and flavorful that I debated stealing my BF's half and devouring it quietly under my seat when he wasn't paying attention.

So after a long day of schlepping dirt into my yard for my new vegetable garden, the last thing I wanted to do with my manure-smelling self was cook. The lady and I were craving Mexican and had eaten Papito's once before (I'll get to that later). I called to place my order. Someone picked up after one ring. A good sign? Nope.

Fine. I ask for two super burritos, one veggie and one braised beef. Okay. I ask him for no mushrooms on the veggie burrito. Not okay. The lug head on the other end of the line says, \"It's all mixed in. We can't take anything out.\" Seriously? What you just said implies that you can't accommodate anyone with a food allergy and that your little shtick about being freshly-prepared is probably a super duper burrito sized load of crap. To this I reply, \"That's interesting, because I've ordered that exact thing before and had no problem. Your customer service is shit. Goodbye.\"\n\nThis brings me to my first trip to Papito's. An out of town friend was visiting and after a night out in the Mission we were all craving a hangover cure of the bean and cheese variety. So up the hill we go. It was a Monday and a little after the lunch rush. We were able to sit down immediately and everything started out fine and dandy. That's when I noticed the sign-up sheet taped to the outside door. It had several names that had not been crossed off and it was clearly remnant from a much busier weekend shift. Yet, no names were crossed off and no one had bothered to take it down. Not a particularly good sign, but I brushed it off as being part of the charm. \n\nWe place our orders. The chips and huac come out pretty quick. The drinks not as quickly. A few minutes later a couple behind us who had arrived after us get their food. Okay... Despite the fact that I've eaten my weight in fried corn, I still want my damn burrito. Finally, about 20 minutes after we ordered our food, the waiter comes to our table and says that the POS system wasn't working and our order didn't go through. Oh, and he forgot what we had ordered because he didn't actually write it down. Interesting that you didn't write down our order at the very same time that the POS system stops working. And yet this didn't effect the other diners around us. Cool story. So we order again, and I'm thinking this food should be coming out on the fly. Nope, wrong again. We wait another 15 minutes until the food finally arrives and the waiter tells us the drinks are on him. Great! A free iced tea for a total time-suck of a meal. At least they were able to give me food without mushrooms. \n\nThe take-away: If you have a solid two or three hours to blow, are willing to spend $12 on a decent burrito, and you don't give a crap about customer service, this place is for you. Personally, if I'm going to spend my money on decent food, I'll just take it around the corner to Goat Hill Pizza, who deliver. On time.

This was by far my favorite. \n\nThe second one I had was the fried chicken taco, which was less exciting, perhaps so because the fried chicken was too dense for the taco itself. \n\nUsually, though, I have the grilled shrimp burrito--which, to me stands out because the shrimp is so plump and juicy.

Definitely a good choice - they pull it off well. \n\nI got the chance to sample quite a few things off the menu, including the elote (grilled corn on the cobb w/spices & cheese), heirloom tomato & nopales (cactus) salad, shrimp ceviche, classic fish tacos, guacamole and cantaloupe agua fresca! I am a big-time fish taco connoisseur, and this one definitely made the grade, done simply with beer battered fish, purple cabbage and chipotle mayo on VERY fresh & soft corn tortillas. The agua fresca was also remarkable, as was the elote. Everything was good. \n\nThe statuesque french waitress was also very helpful in giving recommendations and great service!

Anyways, Papito was not a bad choice. The place is small but that attribute translates into quick and very personal service. \n\nI was in health-mode mood so i decided on two of their entr\u00e9es: the guacamole and the shrimp  ceviche. The order came with chips and three style of salsas, which i thought were very good. However, I think they would've been complimented far better with small warm corn tortillas.  The Guacamole was very good and it comes with huge chunks of avocado in it - enough to heavily consider it a meal. \n\nThe ceviche, or to me, the main dish, comes with prawn-sized shrimp, mangoes, onions and some other good stuff. Which brings me down to the 3-stars. Although this is probably my own fault - everything was excellent, the ceviche was just plainly too salty. The saltiness was enhanced by the corn chips which were also salty. Perhaps if i would've ordered something else to offset the saltiness, I would've had a better experience. But salt with salt always equals too much salt. I also believe ceviche should be marinated and cooked with lime. This is probably how this was made, but the yummy lime flavors you come to expect from ceviche were nowhere to be found, which was a bummer. I think my expectations of ceviche are way high here, so i apologize for being bias about the taste.\n\nOn another positive note, the bathroom was very clean. In my opinion, the bathroom experience always extends to the kitchen and the overall cleanliness of the establishment. :) \n\nBesides the mediocre ceviche experience, I will definitely be coming back to try their many other dishes.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-02-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Papito is part of Potrero Hill's microcosm of gourmet.

Ordered the tomato/cactus salad which came with onion rings (onion rings?) on top. It was merely fair, lacking in individual flavorings; everything ran together. The shrimp taco was very good. My husbands shrimp burrito was tasty as well. But the real reason I give this long anticipated restaurant only two stars is their guacamole, which SUCKED! Just a gloppy. slurpy, slippery, tasteless paste. I reveal my prejudice when I say that I prefer my guacamole to be chunky but I can get over that if it is deliciously flavored. This was not and frankly, the guac is an acid test for any Mexican restaurant because it is so easily prepared; almost hard to ruin. But Papitos did.

Let me establish a few assumptions.\n\n1) We are in San Francisco. Dining is not as cheap as it is in, say, my old local San Diego taco truck. We all knew this going in.\n\n2) This is a restaurant which is serving quality food. I'm not going to expect the flavors (or price, see above) of a greasy 2am burrito. I want something a little nicer.\n\n3) The Potrero neighborhood vibe is intimate -- small, unassuming shops which are routinely packed. This is intentional and good. The waiter is used to locals who enjoy their food, and isn't going to get in my face every 3 minutes about a drink refill. On a Friday night there might be a bit of a wait.\n\nWith that said, /wow/. What a wonderful find. I recently moved to Potrero from Palo Alto, and given the size and decor of the restaurants, I was sure I'd have to spend a small fortune on some overhyped \"gourmet\" portions. In other words, I'd either be frequently cooking at home or frequently guilty at how much of my budget was going to food. Papito, like Chez Maman around the corner, completely broke those preconceived notions. \n\nEverything I've tried has been delicious -- and this is coming from the sort of insufferable guy who always whines about [insert anything north of Los Angeles] Mexican not being up to snuff. The chips and salsa are inventive and wonderful, the calamari addictive, the burritos are uniformly excellent (try the Burrito Mojado with Al Pastor), and the duck confit tacos are out of this world. \n\nThe people are also anything but snobby. The owner clearly loves what he does, and is very friendly. Sit at a table with a friend, or at the bar alone, and have chips and salsa handed to you almost immediately. Service is as quick and attentive as you'd like it -- I can have a leisurely conversation while dining over an hour and a half; or I can get a Corona, an appetizer, and a burrito in under 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, by any reasonable San Francisco standards, the place is CHEAP. If you want to go all out with a beer, appetizer, and dinner, you might be looking at $20. If you just want a world-class burrito that's filling enough to hibernate for another 16 hours, you can do it for $12. No, it isn't a $4 beef-filled doorstop the size of Mark Wahlberg's arm, but is that really what you came to this neighborhood expecting? When compared to just about anything else of quality in the city, it's shockingly reasonable.\n\nGreat food, personal service, grad student prices.

Well, Papito offers a Mexican version of that and you have to try it.\n\nThe space is small, probably only big enough for a dozen or so diners at most. My friend told me the kitchen is actually run by French cooks, hence the inclusion of non-traditional menu offerings like duck confit. Not sure if that's true or just Papito being different, but our waiter (who might also have been the manager) was certainly a fun, charismatic guy who isn't averse to teasing the heck out of you in a good-natured way.

I've eaten here once, although I tried to do take-out one other time.\n\nHow does one \"try\" to do take-out? Let me explain. The Potrero location is about half a mile a way. So after a long day of schlepping dirt into my yard for my new vegetable garden, the last thing I wanted to do with my manure-smelling self was cook. The lady and I were craving Mexican and had eaten Papito's once before (I'll get to that later). I called to place my order. Someone picked up after one ring. A good sign? Nope. The dude on the other end says something indecipherable, which I understood at the time to mean he was going to put me on hold. I say, \"Okay\". He puts me on hold for about 4 seconds and then I get disconnected. Thinking that this was a genuine mistake, I call again. This time I am actually able to hear him as he quickly states that they're busy and asks if I can call back in 5 to 10 minutes. Okay, there was a football/baseball/basketball thing going on in town. I don't sports, so I don't know or care. I have however worked in the service industry and know what it's like to be slammed on a game day. Still, I've never been asked to call back to place an order, especially for pick-up. I'm not even asking you to come to my house man, so how about just scratch my order onto whatever beer-soaked napkin is nearby and put it in the flipping POS system. Sheesh.\n\nI call back 10 minutes later. The background noise on the other end sounds somewhat softer which I take to mean they will now be able to handle taking my order. I ask for chips and guac. Fine. I ask for two super burritos, one veggie and one braised beef. Okay. I ask him for no mushrooms on the veggie burrito. Not okay. The lug head on the other end of the line says, \"It's all mixed in. We can't take anything out.\" Seriously? What you just said implies that you can't accommodate anyone with a food allergy and that your little shtick about being freshly-prepared is probably a super duper burrito sized load of crap. To this I reply, \"That's interesting, because I've ordered that exact thing before and had no problem. Your customer service is shit. Goodbye.\"\n\nThis brings me to my first trip to Papito's. An out of town friend was visiting and after a night out in the Mission we were all craving a hangover cure of the bean and cheese variety. So up the hill we go. It was a Monday and a little after the lunch rush. We were able to sit down immediately and everything started out fine and dandy. That's when I noticed the sign-up sheet taped to the outside door. It had several names that had not been crossed off and it was clearly remnant from a much busier weekend shift. Yet, no names were crossed off and no one had bothered to take it down. Not a particularly good sign, but I brushed it off as being part of the charm. \n\nWe place our orders. The chips and huac come out pretty quick. The drinks not as quickly. A few minutes later a couple behind us who had arrived after us get their food. Okay... Despite the fact that I've eaten my weight in fried corn, I still want my damn burrito. Finally, about 20 minutes after we ordered our food, the waiter comes to our table and says that the POS system wasn't working and our order didn't go through. Oh, and he forgot what we had ordered because he didn't actually write it down. Interesting that you didn't write down our order at the very same time that the POS system stops working. And yet this didn't effect the other diners around us. Cool story. So we order again, and I'm thinking this food should be coming out on the fly. Nope, wrong again. We wait another 15 minutes until the food finally arrives and the waiter tells us the drinks are on him. Great! A free iced tea for a total time-suck of a meal. At least they were able to give me food without mushrooms. \n\nThe take-away: If you have a solid two or three hours to blow, are willing to spend $12 on a decent burrito, and you don't give a crap about customer service, this place is for you. Personally, if I'm going to spend my money on decent food, I'll just take it around the corner to Goat Hill Pizza, who deliver. On time.

Jamie went with the $9 Super Burrito which had duck to go with the rice, beans, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and creme fraiche. For all that, he characterized it as \"pretty good\". Mine was more of a slam dunk, the $8 pair of Carnitas de Pato Tacos, which had duck confit carnitas, homemade pickles, habanero peppers, mint, and chipotle and drizzled with tamarind sauce (see photo). Those were mouthfuls of joy bursting with flavor. \n\nI went overboard and ordered the $10 Carnitas Quesadilla to share (see photo). We were actually hoping they forgot it since it was late coming to the counter, and we were quickly getting stuffed. It was huge and stuffed with Berkshire pork, guajillo salsa roja, shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and a pineapple pico de gallo (see photo). Delicious though we needed to doggie-bag it. That decision allowed us in our self-justified minds to order the $5 Mexican flan, perfectly firm in texture with just the right amount of sweetness from the caramel (see photo). Definitely worth a return visit sometime soon. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid four-star cuisine with tacos and quesadillas that soar and a burrito that was grounded for repairs \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...dark and polished but oh-so cramped \nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly Frenchman followed by a conscientious server \nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice surprise on Potrero Hill, the forgotten dining destination...at least to me", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend told me the kitchen is actually run by French cooks, hence the inclusion of non-traditional menu offerings like duck confit.

Papito is the kind of small, affordable restaurant with lovingly-cooked food that every neighborhood should have.\n\nWe ordered the guacamole to share, they had the enchiladas and I got the 2 tacos for $9 deal, which the menu proudly states comes with sour cream (mmmm, sour cream). The guacamole was thick and garlicky, but missing that zest that I like in my guac. The enchilada was okay, but a little too dry for me.\n\nThe two tacos I picked were the Carne Asada (grilled skirt steak, avocado, caramelized onions, salsa molcajete, salsa roja, fresh radish) and the Papa Con Chorizo (homemade Mexican chorizo, potatoes, salsa verde and pico de gallo). \n\nThe Carne Asada was good, flavorful, filling, yeah, yeah, blah, blah--Holy sweet mother of Jebus, the Papa Con Chorizo was INCREDIBLE!!!

You know how meat and potatoes is a favorite meal combination in America? Well, Papito offers a Mexican version of that and you have to try it.\n\nThe space is small, probably only big enough for a dozen or so diners at most. My friend told me the kitchen is actually run by French cooks, hence the inclusion of non-traditional menu offerings like duck confit.

Let me establish a few assumptions.\n\n1) We are in San Francisco. Dining is not as cheap as it is in, say, my old local San Diego taco truck. We all knew this going in.\n\n2) This is a restaurant which is serving quality food. I'm not going to expect the flavors (or price, see above) of a greasy 2am burrito. I want something a little nicer.\n\n3) The Potrero neighborhood vibe is intimate -- small, unassuming shops which are routinely packed. This is intentional and good. The waiter is used to locals who enjoy their food, and isn't going to get in my face every 3 minutes about a drink refill. On a Friday night there might be a bit of a wait.\n\nWith that said, /wow/. What a wonderful find. I recently moved to Potrero from Palo Alto, and given the size and decor of the restaurants, I was sure I'd have to spend a small fortune on some overhyped \"gourmet\" portions. In other words, I'd either be frequently cooking at home or frequently guilty at how much of my budget was going to food. Papito, like Chez Maman around the corner, completely broke those preconceived notions. \n\nEverything I've tried has been delicious -- and this is coming from the sort of insufferable guy who always whines about [insert anything north of Los Angeles] Mexican not being up to snuff. The chips and salsa are inventive and wonderful, the calamari addictive, the burritos are uniformly excellent (try the Burrito Mojado with Al Pastor), and the duck confit tacos are out of this world. \n\nThe people are also anything but snobby. The owner clearly loves what he does, and is very friendly. Sit at a table with a friend, or at the bar alone, and have chips and salsa handed to you almost immediately. Service is as quick and attentive as you'd like it -- I can have a leisurely conversation while dining over an hour and a half; or I can get a Corona, an appetizer, and a burrito in under 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, by any reasonable San Francisco standards, the place is CHEAP. If you want to go all out with a beer, appetizer, and dinner, you might be looking at $20. If you just want a world-class burrito that's filling enough to hibernate for another 16 hours, you can do it for $12. No, it isn't a $4 beef-filled doorstop the size of Mark Wahlberg's arm, but is that really what you came to this neighborhood expecting? When compared to just about anything else of quality in the city, it's shockingly reasonable.\n\nGreat food, personal service, grad student prices.

There are 3-4 outdoor tables.  Beer and wine for sure, an agave tequila, and I don't know if there's more alcohol beyond that. \n\nMy first visit was on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quick bite.  The place was packed, but it had good energy: lively convo, orange and red interiors with the rainy dark outside had everyone in the place very happy to be indoors.  There weren't seats immediately available, so we gladly stood inside and sipped on Sangria to get us started.  That was delicious!  I've never heard of white sangria, so we had the red (we had the white on Sunday night).   Very yummy, and dangerous if you like sweet and don't pay attention.\n \nWhen a table finally opened up 10 minutes later, we order tacos:  the Carnitas de Pato (duck confit carnitas, pickles, mint, tamarind sauce) and Pollo Empanizado (breaded fried chicken, chipotle remoulade, salsa roja, guacamole, pico de gallo, purple cabbage slaw, cr\u00e8me fraiche).  So, so, so tasty, especially the cr\u00e8me fraiche.  Two tacos run for $8.00/which I think were well worth the value for the flavors involved.  My girlfriend got the (Chicken) Enchiladas Rojas (three? enchiladas, red sauce, cr\u00e8me fraiche, cheese.  Those come in pork, too.  I didn't think those were as good for the $13.\n\nWe also got guacamole and chips.  The guac was delicious, came out very fast, and beautifully presented.   In fact, all of our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  Because the interior is so intimate, they were good about attending to our table without hovering or coming back too often.\n\nOn our Sunday trip, our party had five to start, and two more arrived an hour later.  They did a great job of juggling our needs (7 people sitting together) while juggling theirs.   The food was as excellent as the Friday before,  and they were super, super cheerful the whole time without making us rushed or embarrassed to take up the whole bar.\n\n* * *\nGo there if you're down for some Mexican cuisine that isn't just a super burrito (which they do have, BTW) in a classy environment that you doesn't require you to be classy.  If you're willing to try new combinations (tamarind, pineapple, duck), you'll be in for a treat.

HOLY. so good, so wonderfully duck-gamey. ahhh such a beauty! drenched in all that sauce and cheese, that pungent duck aroma wafting up...got damn. a fantastic contrast with the delicate flavors of the rock cod super burrito. had alternating bites of both types of burritos = party in my moufffff!! they also stuffed the burrito to death with duck. cutting it open, the sight brought happy tears to my eyes.\n\nlove how slightly toasty the tortillas were for the burritos :) and the chips given were very moreish too, must be the obvious traces of salt on them - not complaining though. they were good! the entire meal was positively nomzy.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-11-23"}]}
