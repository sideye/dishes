I decided to give Miyabi another go, since it had been well over a year or two since I had been there last. The last time I went I had a bad experience which was MOSTLY based off poor customer service. I have never had much of an issue with food quality here, so figured it was worth giving another shot. Especially since not many places offer a bento box with EVERYTHING I want for under $15. My favorites/must haves are Salmon Teriyaki, Shrimp Tempura and tuna sashimi/maki/nigiri etc\nThey used to have one called the \"Shogun\" special but now I think it's called the 'Deluxe Salmon Bento\" or something along those lines. \nI came in for lunch around 1:30/2ish on a Saturday for my birthday. The front of the restaurant was full so we sat in the back, which was pretty empty. The customer service was GREAT (compared to previous times) considering they were a bit busy for lunch. The waitress was friendly and overall the customer service was great. She checked in with us to make sure our food was okay and overall had NO issues with customer service this time. The food was pretty good! My dad got the Deluxe Chicken lunch and my only complaint would be that some bits of the chicken were overcooked and really dry. Other than that though the food was really good and the fish seemed pretty fresh. I'm actually pregnant (Yes I am VERY well aware it is not advised...but keep in mind women in Japan consume it but prob cos quality is better) so I was actually being a bit picky about where and what I ate. Call me a daredevil or crazy but I had 2 pieces of nigri and was impressed by how good the quality was, for it not being a super fancy or upscale restaurant. I've been craving maguro sashimi (my fave) for quite sometime and decided I would lt myself have ONE piece while pregnant. Was very happy with the quality and freshness. They have tons of really affordable lunch specials for about $10! I think they have at least 5 different combos to choose from? I really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely be getting this again! Really filling and great for the price!  \nThe one I got was $14 for the Deluxe Salmon (Or Chicken) Bento lunch, which you get the following:\n- Miso Soup, Salad and Rice\n- Salmon (or chicken) Teriyaki (good portion size especially for lunch!)\n- 1 pc Shrimp Tempura, 4 pc veggie Tempura\n- 1 gyoza \n- 3 pc California Roll\n- 1 pc Salmon Nigiri\n- 1 pc Tuna Nigiri\n\nOverall was a good experience and they have definitely improved on customer service and quality!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["My combination dinner of sashimi (3 kinds, 2 slices each), tempura and gyoza was $17.

I decided to give Miyabi another go, since it had been well over a year or two since I had been there last. The last time I went I had a bad experience which was MOSTLY based off poor customer service. I have never had much of an issue with food quality here, so figured it was worth giving another shot. Especially since not many places offer a bento box with EVERYTHING I want for under $15. My favorites/must haves are Salmon Teriyaki, Shrimp Tempura and tuna sashimi/maki/nigiri etc\nThey used to have one called the \"Shogun\" special but now I think it's called the 'Deluxe Salmon Bento\" or something along those lines. \nI came in for lunch around 1:30/2ish on a Saturday for my birthday. The front of the restaurant was full so we sat in the back, which was pretty empty. The customer service was GREAT (compared to previous times) considering they were a bit busy for lunch. The waitress was friendly and overall the customer service was great. She checked in with us to make sure our food was okay and overall had NO issues with customer service this time. The food was pretty good! My dad got the Deluxe Chicken lunch and my only complaint would be that some bits of the chicken were overcooked and really dry. Other than that though the food was really good and the fish seemed pretty fresh. I'm actually pregnant (Yes I am VERY well aware it is not advised...but keep in mind women in Japan consume it but prob cos quality is better) so I was actually being a bit picky about where and what I ate. Call me a daredevil or crazy but I had 2 pieces of nigri and was impressed by how good the quality was, for it not being a super fancy or upscale restaurant. I've been craving maguro sashimi (my fave) for quite sometime and decided I would lt myself have ONE piece while pregnant. Was very happy with the quality and freshness. They have tons of really affordable lunch specials for about $10! I think they have at least 5 different combos to choose from? I really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely be getting this again! Really filling and great for the price!  \nThe one I got was $14 for the Deluxe Salmon (Or Chicken) Bento lunch, which you get the following:\n- Miso Soup, Salad and Rice\n- Salmon (or chicken) Teriyaki (good portion size especially for lunch!)\n- 1 pc Shrimp Tempura, 4 pc veggie Tempura\n- 1 gyoza \n- 3 pc California Roll\n- 1 pc Salmon Nigiri\n- 1 pc Tuna Nigiri\n\nOverall was a good experience and they have definitely improved on customer service and quality!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-19"}], "shiro maguro sashimi": [], "hamachi sashimi": [{"excerpts": ["Friday\nHamachi Sashimi: was descent, although texturally a bit firm because it was over chilled. \n\n"], "author": "Ty T.", "review": "6-September, Friday\nHamachi Sashimi: was descent, although texturally a bit firm because it was over chilled. \n\nSpicy Tuna: the level of freshness was questionable, and a huge red flag was wavering as it was texturally gritty as if it had fallen on the ground.

On this occasion the special item was katsuo nigiri.\n\nPacing: Poor. Miso soup and green salad (included with the chirashi) came right away from the server. Before I had finished the soup, the chef handed me the sunomono. Finished the soup and was midway through the sunomono when the agedashi tofu arrived from the server. In the midst of the tofu when the chef handed me the chirashi. Halfway done with the chirashi when the chef handed me the katsuo (I expected them to come at the same time). For most of the meal there was at least one untouched dish waiting in front of me. Arrived at 8:00 on Thursday night to a mostly empty restaurant, out by 8:45.\n\nMiso Soup: Standard. Nothing about it stood out but it was competently made, with a few small cubes of tofu and some wakame.\n\nAgedashi Tofu: Different. Squares of tofu, about 1 1/2\" on a side, 1/2\" tall, nicely battered and deep fried. There were 5 of them served on a plate, on top of a piece of lettuce, topped with a sauce like a sweet version of katsu sauce. No ginger, scallions, or broth. Reasonably tasty but I prefer more traditional accompaniments.\n\nSunomono: Below average. They used Asian cucumber, seeded and thinly sliced, which was nice. The dressing seemed somewhat off-flavor - not terrible but not good. The salad came with 1 piece of ebi that was not very good - grainy texture and a sort of 'old' flavor. It also came with 1 piece of what I think was akagai, which was OK quality. The dish included two orange slices, which seemed incongruous.\n\nKatsuo Nigiri: Worst katsuo I've ever had. The fish seemed very off-flavor and it looked like it had been sitting around for a long time. Traditionally served tataki-style (seared on the outside), this fish did not appear to have been seared at all. It was drowned in ponzu such that the rice was falling apart. I ate the second piece hoping it would be better and wished I hadn't. I should have sent it back after the first piece.\n\nChirashi: OK. It came with about 20 pieces of 5 kinds of fish but they were cut small and thin (which I consider to be an appropriate size for chirashi) so I'd say it was about the equivalent of 10 pieces of sashimi. It also had some tamago that looked store-bought, a spoonful of seaweed salad, a few thin strips of oshinko and gobo, and a small mound of what I think was pickled plum. The fish quality was fine except for the ebi, which had the same texture and flavor problems as the piece that came in the sunomono. Plenty of rice. Standard presentation.\n\nShari: Great! The sushi rice was excellent in flavor and texture - just the right degree of sticky, chewy, and tender.\n\nCondiments: Wasabi from powder, standard quality. Gari (pickled ginger) was fine. Suma (shredded daikon) was typical rotary-grater style.\n\nTea: Standard with sufficient refills. No alcohol currently, so no sake or beer though they both appear on the menu.\n\nAtmosphere: Fine - clean and neat but nothing special. A lot of plastic containers and some plastic greenery in the sushi case, which I don't find very visually appealing.\n\nOther notes: No one behind the bar or hostess stand when I came in, took a few minutes for someone to appear. At one point an older lady came from the kitchen to behind the bar, took out a plastic container of something, and sniffed at it questioningly. This did not inspire confidence. Not a very impressive Specials board - it listed toro of tuna, white tuna, and salmon, as well as the katsuo. Considering how unspecial the katsuo was, I wonder about the various toro options. No oshobori (hot towel).\n\nOverall: OK for the price ($32, including tax) but not really worth another trip. If it hadn't been for the katsuo and ebi, I'd rank them higher.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-03-06"}], "ankimo nigiri": [], "natto nigiri": [], "sunomono with taki and ebi salad": [], "ika sansai salad": [], "oshitashi salad": [], "pieces combination sashimi": [], "pieces deluxe sashimi": [], "miyabi love boat": [], "miso soup lunch": [], "white rice lunch": [], "gyoza lunch": [], "edamame lunch": [], "croquette lunch": [], "hiyayakko lunch": [], "pieces green mussel lunch": [], "chicken yakitori lunch": [], "soft shell crab lunch": [], "pieces agedashi tofu lunch": [], "shiro maguro tataki lunch": [], "katsuo tataki lunch": [], "wakame salad lunch": [], "green salad lunch": [], "sunomono lunch": [], "oshitashi lunch": [], "ika sansai salad lunch": [], "spicy tuna salad lunch": [], "tsukemono lunch": [], "brown rice lunch": [], "chicken teriyaki and tempura lunch": [{"excerpts": ["I got the chicken teriyaki and tempura lunch combo.

I decided to give Miyabi another go, since it had been well over a year or two since I had been there last. The last time I went I had a bad experience which was MOSTLY based off poor customer service. I have never had much of an issue with food quality here, so figured it was worth giving another shot. Especially since not many places offer a bento box with EVERYTHING I want for under $15. My favorites/must haves are Salmon Teriyaki, Shrimp Tempura and tuna sashimi/maki/nigiri etc\nThey used to have one called the \"Shogun\" special but now I think it's called the 'Deluxe Salmon Bento\" or something along those lines. \nI came in for lunch around 1:30/2ish on a Saturday for my birthday. The front of the restaurant was full so we sat in the back, which was pretty empty. The customer service was GREAT (compared to previous times) considering they were a bit busy for lunch. The waitress was friendly and overall the customer service was great. She checked in with us to make sure our food was okay and overall had NO issues with customer service this time. The food was pretty good! My dad got the Deluxe Chicken lunch and my only complaint would be that some bits of the chicken were overcooked and really dry. Other than that though the food was really good and the fish seemed pretty fresh. I'm actually pregnant (Yes I am VERY well aware it is not advised...but keep in mind women in Japan consume it but prob cos quality is better) so I was actually being a bit picky about where and what I ate. Call me a daredevil or crazy but I had 2 pieces of nigri and was impressed by how good the quality was, for it not being a super fancy or upscale restaurant. I've been craving maguro sashimi (my fave) for quite sometime and decided I would lt myself have ONE piece while pregnant. Was very happy with the quality and freshness. They have tons of really affordable lunch specials for about $10! I think they have at least 5 different combos to choose from? I really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely be getting this again! Really filling and great for the price!  \nThe one I got was $14 for the Deluxe Salmon (Or Chicken) Bento lunch, which you get the following:\n- Miso Soup, Salad and Rice\n- Salmon (or chicken) Teriyaki (good portion size especially for lunch!)\n- 1 pc Shrimp Tempura, 4 pc veggie Tempura\n- 1 gyoza \n- 3 pc California Roll\n- 1 pc Salmon Nigiri\n- 1 pc Tuna Nigiri\n\nOverall was a good experience and they have definitely improved on customer service and quality!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Miyabi's is my favorite place to get a huge Bento lunch for under $8 "], "author": "Shannon A.", "review": "Miyabi's is my favorite place to get a huge Bento lunch for under $8 and if I'm feeling especially worthy of a good meal, I love the Sake Nigiri and the Unagi Nigiri too.
