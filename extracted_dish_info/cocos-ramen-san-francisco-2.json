Most folks came in pairs, or as a sizable group which they can accommodate by putting their tables together. Per Coco's website, they take reservations for parties with 6 to 8 people. \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.50), medium spicy, and added pork belly (+$3.50) and black garlic (+$1). My favorite parts of the bowl were the al dente noodles, the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, and the tender and flavorful pork belly. The broth was unlike one I've had before and wasn't your typical creamy, porky tonkotsu broth. It was still savory and tasty nonetheless. The bamboo shoots were a let down. They tasted like they came straight out of the can and weren't treated so the shoots had that intense musty bamboo flavor.  \n\nWe also ordered the grilled whole squid app ($12) which arrived to our table after our bowls of ramen. The ramen came out pretty fast but I would have preferred the meal to start with the appetizer and the noodle soup bowls to follow at a reasonable pace. The squid was served with a ponzu sauce and a spicy mayo sauce. For me, the flavor of the spicy mayo sauce was like nacho cheese. Not a bad thing but just different. While the squid wasn't overcooked, it could have been grilled longer for a more intense flavor and to add some charred texture to the squid. \n\nFood price tags were a bit hefty but service was very friendly.

All five tables were taken up yet six chairs remained empty. And some tables that were up against the benches wasted seating space. They could have easily accommodated six more people in one hour.\n\nTO THE BUSINESS OWNER:\n\nGet smaller, two-person tables so you don't waste 2 chairs when it's only two people dining at a 4-person table. Rearrange these smaller tables into larger tables as needed. Rethink how to put these smaller tables against your bench seating to maximize use of the space. The large, heavy wooden tables you have now may look nice but you're losing business. You can get smaller, modern looking tables and still keep the ambiance since your decor is pretty modern anyway. Don't worry about putting the tables closer together. If you look at other restaurants, the tables are closer (but not too close).

We tried the miso and shoyu, both of which turned out to be excellent broths: I suggest getting it spicy and with black garlic for an extra kick, because they don't charge extra for spicy and black garlic isn't available at all ramen places.\n\nIn short, I'd say their ramen is goldilocks style, i.e. just right.

It is an appetizer, cooked with mashed pumpkin and a mid boiled egg. The yolk is just perfect (semi cooked yolk.) I nicked name it as the \"bomb\". It also comes with a sweet tingly spicy mayo sauce. The sauce I say is DELICIOUS, it really exaggerates the flavor of the pumpkin. This is definitely a must try! But may I warn you, it is very filling (suggest you share with 3+ people). I also ordered the Tonkatsu Black Garlic Ramen with Chashu (meat). I cannot finish the ramen because I was so STUFFED with the Kabocha. The broth/flavor is very strong.

All five tables were taken up yet six chairs remained empty. And some tables that were up against the benches wasted seating space. They could have easily accommodated six more people in one hour.\n\nTO THE BUSINESS OWNER:\n\nGet smaller, two-person tables so you don't waste 2 chairs when it's only two people dining at a 4-person table. Rearrange these smaller tables into larger tables as needed. Rethink how to put these smaller tables against your bench seating to maximize use of the space. The large, heavy wooden tables you have now may look nice but you're losing business. You can get smaller, modern looking tables and still keep the ambiance since your decor is pretty modern anyway. Don't worry about putting the tables closer together. If you look at other restaurants, the tables are closer (but not too close).

I have pudgy pudges all year round and multiple layers of clothing makes me look like the the Michelin Man. *le sigh*\n\nIt's ramen weather now so I've been on a hunt for a good bowl of ramen without msg. Admittedly, I was very skeptical about Coco's Ramen. It's from the same owners as Crazy Sushi and it's not Japanese owned or operated. I thought it would be another run-of-the-mill, Chinese owned ramen joint. \n\nWell, I was wrong....\n\nOpening on November 12th, Coco's Ramen serves 7 ramen varieties among typical Japanese apps (agedashi tofu, karaage, and gyoza), and yakitori. Ramen menu: http://bit.ly/1r14bH2. Sake, shochu, and beer is available (I had the sugar-free iichiko on the rocks and it gave me a good buzz). They use no msg in any of their food. Woot woot!\n\nWe started with House Fried Chicken Wings ($7) and the Gyutan: Beef Tongue Yakitori ($5). The chicken wings weren't exactly what I expected them to be but they were darn good: http://bit.ly/1zGu1FC. The drummettes were marinated, partially deboned, battered and fried. They were crunchy, flavorful, and moist. I found it odd that they served it with Thai sweet chili dipping sauce though. I would skip the yakitori. The gyutan was dinky, very thinly sliced, and overseasoned with shio (salt) and black pepper: http://bit.ly/1F7dQEe. Yakitori typically isn't seasoned with black pepper. We were given Teba: Chicken Wings by accident. \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.50) which comes with nori, half a soft-boiled egg, your choice of chashu (pork shoulder) or pork belly, and your specified level of spiciness: http://bit.ly/1AnvRhT. I asked for both protein options (+$3) and no spicy (I like to doctor up the broth myself with togarashi chili pepper). I also added black garlic (+$1) and corn (no add'l charge). \n\nI was pleasantly surprised with how good the ramen was for Bernal Heights. I think they accidentally added spice because my tonkotsu broth had a red hue but that was fine. The broth was rich and subtly creamy. It's not as creamy as other tonkotsu broths because they use a combo of pork and chicken stock. Seasoning wise, it was flavorful to me but people who favor msg-laden broths may find it a little bland. The thick, curly noodles seemed very commercialized but they were perfectly cooked; al-dente with a nice, toothsome chew. Definitely opt for the tender chashu over the pork belly which was dry. The highlight? The soft-boiled egg. I hate when ramen joint overcook their eggs. Here, the yolk was still custardy with a slightly molten core: http://bit.ly/1xGwsKp. Pure deliciousness. \n\nService was very pleasant and the staff was really nice. They checked up on us several times. However, they seem to having issues in the kitchen because it took 30 minutes for our bowl of ramen in an empty restaurant (one other couple there). Hopefully, they streamline their processes once they iron out their kinks. One of my gripes was they charged us for the Teba: Chicken Wings. A customer should never have to pay for something that was given to them in error. \n\nThe ambiance is quite quirky. It's like being in my Chinese great-grandmother's living room with antique Chinese furnishings (chairs were uncomfortable) and pictures of cute South East Asian children. It's a shared space with Crazy Sushi so there's only 5 four-tops, and 8 counter seats. \n\nParking in the area is pretty difficult after 6 pm (next to Pizza Hacker, half a block away from Ichi and Front Porch). \n\nFeedback to the Owner:\nI overheard the couple next to us asking a lot of questions about the menu which can be much improved. People may not be familiar with items on the menu like geso karaage (fried squid) or tonkatsu kushiage (deep fried pork skewers) so having short descriptions/translations of what these items are will be more efficient for your staff and your customers. Also, the ramen menu is not very clear: 1) There needs to be a clear distinction that you get a choice of chashu OR pork belly;  2) If you will be charging for black garlic, that needs to be specified on the menu (looks complimentary); 3) List all toppings (corn was available but not listed on the menu). \n\nLastly, making a flavorful ramen broth without msg is not an easy task. It's a great selling point for the area so you should consider adding that you don't use msg into the existing paragraph explaining how your ramen is made.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-20"}], "chicken karaage": [{"excerpts": ["On top of that, I also tried the Chicken Karaage which was a major disappointment as well.

Parking in the area was a bit difficult and we had to circle a few times before finding a metered spot nearby. There's a good amount of seating but since it was a Friday night around 7pm we ended up getting seats at the bar.\n\nThe TLDR version is: appetizers were decent, ramen itself was meh to average.\n\nAppetizers:\n1) Pork Gyoza: Much larger than a lot of gyoza I've had. Very thin exterior and a flavorful filling. I think it could have been fried a bit longer but that's just personal preference. It was still a bit pricy for what you get though (4/5)\n2) Squid Leg Karaage: My friend's appetizer. Legs weren't too chewy and batter was nicely seasoned. Not something I'd normally order but I enjoyed it (3.5/5)\n3) Bacon wrapped mochi: I keep ordering these but I never enjoy them very much. Bacon wasn't crispy enough to contrast the soft mochi and mochi wasn't sweet enough to compliment the bacon's saltiness. Not bad but kind of just tasted neutral. (3/5)\n4) Beef tongue skewer: Very well seasoned and not too dry considering how thin the slices were. (4/5)\n\nRamen:\nI got the black garlic tonkotsu w/ chashu and my friend got the spicy black garlic tonkotsu w/ chashu. Despite the fact we almost had the same dish her's was far saltier than mine. The broth wasn't very rich and the black garlic oil didn't really add much. The chashu flavor good, slightly sweet and tender but some bits were a bit too dry for me. The noodles were on the thicker side which would work well if the broth was richer. Overall not bad but since this was the main course I was a bit disappointed.

One brings out collective groans from tripe-haters, while the other attracts the palate of every Asian in this city between the ages of 22 and 35. You would think I was looking for the former since I was on the 14-Mission past Cesar Chavez, but no, I was looking for this new spot off 29th Street right next to Crazy Sushi, another place that never caught my eye or wallet. Sure enough, it's the same owner who has decided to jump on the ramen bandwagon. So naturally I had to try it on a cold wintry night when I needed a bowl of noodles to comfort my soul.\n\nTheir signage consisted of a piece of paper taped to the front door (photo: http://bit.ly/1strz6g). Even though it was half-empty, I was relegated as a solitary diner to the little two-seat counter facing the front window, not the most comfortable spot in the place but at least I had it to myself. It should come as no surprise that I selected the $11.50 Tonkotsu Ramen, my personal favorite, even though seven varieties are offered. But first, some appetizers were necessary. OK, 'necessary' is an overstatement. I was just hungry from the long bus ride. I ordered the $8 Fried Oysters, which I thought were a bit overpriced for four semi-plump pieces as good as they were.\n\nThey came with some sweet-and-sour sauce which I didn't like much (photo: http://bit.ly/1C1EU5l) since I would have preferred a spicy aioli.

Now what was interesting is that they offer what kind of broth finish you want, so I ordered the black garlic based on a variation I tried at the Ramen Shop over in Oakland. But more strangely, I don't believe pork chashu was a complimentary topping.\n\nIt didn't matter so much in my case because I automatically ordered the double braised pork belly for an extra $3.50, but I would have been bummed if my carnivery was meant to be satisfied merely by the pork broth. The other ingredients, however, were all present and accounted for: the soft-boiled egg half, bamboo shoots, shredded vegetables, and nori (photo: http://bit.ly/1BgRNdV). The broth certainly had a palpable kick to it, and I just asked for medium. There's no telling what happens when the spiciness moves up a few notches. The texture of the noodles were reasonably al dente, so all was still right with the world.

Admittedly, I was very skeptical about Coco's Ramen. It's from the same owners as Crazy Sushi and it's not Japanese owned or operated. I thought it would be another run-of-the-mill, Chinese owned ramen joint. \n\nWell, I was wrong....\n\nOpening on November 12th, Coco's Ramen serves 7 ramen varieties among typical Japanese apps (agedashi tofu, karaage, and gyoza), and yakitori. Ramen menu: http://bit.ly/1r14bH2. Sake, shochu, and beer is available (I had the sugar-free iichiko on the rocks and it gave me a good buzz). They use no msg in any of their food. Woot woot!\n\nWe started with House Fried Chicken Wings ($7) and the Gyutan: Beef Tongue Yakitori ($5). The chicken wings weren't exactly what I expected them to be but they were darn good: http://bit.ly/1zGu1FC. The drummettes were marinated, partially deboned, battered and fried. They were crunchy, flavorful, and moist. I found it odd that they served it with Thai sweet chili dipping sauce though. I would skip the yakitori. The gyutan was dinky, very thinly sliced, and overseasoned with shio (salt) and black pepper: http://bit.ly/1F7dQEe. Yakitori typically isn't seasoned with black pepper. We were given Teba: Chicken Wings by accident. \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.50) which comes with nori, half a soft-boiled egg, your choice of chashu (pork shoulder) or pork belly, and your specified level of spiciness: http://bit.ly/1AnvRhT. I asked for both protein options (+$3) and no spicy (I like to doctor up the broth myself with togarashi chili pepper). I also added black garlic (+$1) and corn (no add'l charge). \n\nI was pleasantly surprised with how good the ramen was for Bernal Heights. I think they accidentally added spice because my tonkotsu broth had a red hue but that was fine. The broth was rich and subtly creamy. It's not as creamy as other tonkotsu broths because they use a combo of pork and chicken stock. Seasoning wise, it was flavorful to me but people who favor msg-laden broths may find it a little bland. The thick, curly noodles seemed very commercialized but they were perfectly cooked; al-dente with a nice, toothsome chew. Definitely opt for the tender chashu over the pork belly which was dry. The highlight? The soft-boiled egg. I hate when ramen joint overcook their eggs. Here, the yolk was still custardy with a slightly molten core: http://bit.ly/1xGwsKp. Pure deliciousness. \n\nService was very pleasant and the staff was really nice. They checked up on us several times. However, they seem to having issues in the kitchen because it took 30 minutes for our bowl of ramen in an empty restaurant (one other couple there). Hopefully, they streamline their processes once they iron out their kinks. One of my gripes was they charged us for the Teba: Chicken Wings. A customer should never have to pay for something that was given to them in error. \n\nThe ambiance is quite quirky. It's like being in my Chinese great-grandmother's living room with antique Chinese furnishings (chairs were uncomfortable) and pictures of cute South East Asian children. It's a shared space with Crazy Sushi so there's only 5 four-tops, and 8 counter seats. \n\nParking in the area is pretty difficult after 6 pm (next to Pizza Hacker, half a block away from Ichi and Front Porch). \n\nFeedback to the Owner:\nI overheard the couple next to us asking a lot of questions about the menu which can be much improved. People may not be familiar with items on the menu like geso karaage (fried squid) or tonkatsu kushiage (deep fried pork skewers) so having short descriptions/translations of what these items are will be more efficient for your staff and your customers. Also, the ramen menu is not very clear: 1) There needs to be a clear distinction that you get a choice of chashu OR pork belly;  2) If you will be charging for black garlic, that needs to be specified on the menu (looks complimentary); 3) List all toppings (corn was available but not listed on the menu). \n\nLastly, making a flavorful ramen broth without msg is not an easy task. It's a great selling point for the area so you should consider adding that you don't use msg into the existing paragraph explaining how your ramen is made.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered beef tongue and squid \"yakitori\" as appetizers.

The ramen shop is not too small - there are a good number of tables, but they only had half of their restaurant open for lunch service. The other half (seemingly a sushi bar) was closed otherwise there would have been many more tables. \n\nTheir menu is quite simple. They have a section for appetizers, yakitori, fried appetizers, and vegetables, but what they are popular for is their ramen. The prices are a bit more expensive than what you would pay for ramen in SGV, but it is SF - they offer the regular seafood, tonkotsu, miso, shoyu, vegetable, curry, and shio. Some broths are marked light, creamy, classic, flavorful, etc. which was interesting to see. What I found to be interesting was that instead of the usual chashu, they also give the option of adding braised pork belly to the ramen. \n\nMy family all tried the various ramen - tonkotsu and shoyu, but I decided to go with the curry. It's definitely more interesting, and I read a ton of good things about it. A ton of people also recommend adding the black garlic (additional $1), but I think all the bowls tasted fine without the black garlic. I was able to try all three bowls - they tasted pretty good; tonkotsu was more flavorful while the shoyu was a bit on the lighter side. \n\nI ended up being super glad that I went with the curry ramen. For $11.50, it was a pretty good deal! There was a good amount of ingredients inside, including half of a soft boiled egg. There was also bamboo shoots and green onion, but what stood out was the curry broth. I've tried curry ramen that didn't taste too great, but Coco's really perfected the broth!
