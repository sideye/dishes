I knew I had to come when it was mentioned briefly in one of the Netflix series \"Mind of a Chef\" episodes that featured April Bloomfield. Top notch pasta all made in house? UMM YES PLEASE. I don't even care if Kim K or Kanye dined here.\n\nThankfully it's not egregious to score a reservation here! I've always been curious about this place.. an unassuming brick building on a corner in the quiet and desolate Jackson Square area.. not really a reason to come to this area unless you plan to venture out to North Beach afterwards - at least that means parking isn't horrendous.\n\nCame around 5:30 on a Sunday to a half-full restaurant (half an hour early for our reservation), and it filled up quick! Reservations recommended. The space was modern but rustic, I loved the wooden tables and benches. Lots of natural light from the huge windows. Gets a bit loud but I guess that kind goes with the Italian 'family-style' feel.\n\nI came here to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend and they customized the placemat which was thoughtful! Seems like a lot of people come here to celebrate events as the group next to us had a birthday, and the table next to us was also celebrating an anniversary. We received complementary champagne which was a nice touch. (If you want to keep the placement as a memento, feel free to ask the host for a clean copy as they print extras!)\nBoth the server and hostess congratulated us on our anniversary as we sat down, and I already knew we'd have great service throughout our meal.\n\nMost of the menu was in Italian (the pastas) which was intimidating but the server explained each item thoroughly.. I wanted to try everything! It seems like most of their menu is seasonal as well (guaranteeing the freshest of ingredients!) so that means I have to come back.. I don't mind :)\n\nWe got three pasta dishes, a salad, and cannoli for dessert. \n\nEverything was delicious but my favorite was hands down the raviolo di ricotta - served year round. This was definitely my favorite of the night as it's a huge ravioli with a soft cooked egg inside with melted cheese on the outside. Savory, creamy, buttery, rich.. TO DIE FORRR.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you LOVE pasta. Their pastas aren't overpowered with sauces and cheese and simply brings out the best of the ingredients being used, all of which are seasonal. Their desserts don't disappoint either as the cannoli was amazing, and my coworker said that their sorbet was amazing (even when I asked. just.. sorbet?!) It wasn't on the menu when I was there but I'll have to try it when I see it as well!\n\nIt was on the pricier side but definitely paying for the quality and service! I thought pricing was quite fair for ~135 (pre-tip) for 2 cocktails, 3 pasta dishes, 1 salad, and dessert!\n\nDefinitely going to return to try their pizzas as well next time and looking forward to see what will be on their pasta list next time!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-05-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Ding #1\n\n2) raviolo di ricotta - interesting pasta but super heavy. "], "author": "Remus L.", "review": "Cotogna is an upscale casual eatery and the sister restaurant of SF favorite Quince. With the heat wave and long weekend, we thought it would be an opportune time to dine here for a late brunch without a wait...and we were right! \n\nTables were literally right next to each other. Some would call it cozy, I'd say it's crammed for max seating. The restaurant was half full and I could barely have a conversation with my dining companion because our neighbors were so close to us and had a lively conversation.\n\nOnto the food, we had the following courses:\n\n1) salad de nice, which came with some mushy/unidentifiable fish and anchovies, heirloom tomatoes, greens and an egg in a light vinaigrette. The table next to us was offered freshly ground pepper but we were not. Ding #1\n\n2) raviolo di ricotta - interesting pasta but super heavy. One ravioli filled with ricotta and a runny egg  and drenched in brown butter. If you haven't had this elsewhere, I'd recommend you order it; otherwise, skip it - I've had better renditions.\n\n3) corn and chive triangoli - better dish of the two pasta courses. While this was a solid dish, the chive was completely missed and did nothing.\n\n4) focaccia - I read on Yelp that this was a must get. Honestly, nothing to write home about. It's just bread!\n\n5) Tuscan fried chicken - The dish itself was fine. Lightly battered pieces of boneless chicken with pickled Romano beans. Decently seasoned and even the white meat was moist!\n\nSounds like an okay meal but why the two stars? Let me tell you why...\n\nWe over ordered and planned to take home the fried chicken. Our server took away our dishes and didn't ask if we wanted them packed up. She proceeded to bring us the check and I thought it was odd she didn't bring back our leftovers with the check. I inquired about our doggy bag and she gave this look of panic and quickly said, \"Oh let me check.\" Her look alone was enough for me to know what happened.\n\nI wish she would have just came clean and fessed up to what happened. Instead, we waited for about five minutes and the manager came over explaining what happened. Never once was she apologetic and instead said there must have been \"confusion\" and she didn't know we wanted to pack it home.\n\nHonestly, I could have cared less and would have said, \"Don't worry about it. These things happen.\" However, there was never an apology of any sort so I proceeded with the conversation below:\n\nMe: \"Well, the server never asked if we wanted it packed home.\"\nManager: \"Well, we never ask.\"\n\nYou're an upscale casual restaurant and I literally paid $113 for lunch with a $5 mandate...I wouldn't think it's uncommon to ask for a restaurant of your caliber. I've been to plenty of restaurants...whether it's The French Laundry, Puccino or Delfina or what not, servers have always asked if we wanted to pack home anything. \n\nTo add insult to injury, she then proceeds with:\n\nManager: \"We still have some 'leftover chicken' and we'd love to make it up if you have the time.\"\n\nOkay, why in the world would I want your \"leftover chicken.\" This sounds terrible and not only that but saying that you never ask a customer if they want to take something home is a horrible excuse. Change your policy to avoid confusion! \n\nWe declined her atrocious offer and said don't worry about it and the manager walks away. By now, I'm angry and repulsed that she made such an offer. I signed the bill and we get up to leave.\n\nThe manager comes back...Jesus Christ! What now?! Have you not said enough?\n\nManager: \"We'd like to make it up to you by at least comping your drinks.\"\nMe: \"Don't worry about it.\"\nManager: \"Is there anything else we can do?\"\nMe: \"No.\"\n\nTerrible. Don't even bother asking. You should have offered the comp when we declined your offer to make us \"leftover chicken.\" This just seems like a half hearted attempt to somewhat apologize.\n\nLet me quote figures for you. My husband had some sort of Italian soda and I had a lemonade. Total is at most $12. Tuscan fried chicken was $24. Do the math.\n\nOptically, this is what it seems like, \"It's not entirely our fault so we'll comp you half the cost of the dish.\"\n\nNo thank you. It's not about the cost or the food but more about principle. SF has many restaurants that I don't feel the need to come back and succumb to okay food with horrible service from management. \n\nYou know what would have been a better thing to say in this situation? Let me educate you...\"I'm sorry for the confusion and I'd love to make it up to you by having the kitchen remake an order for you if you have the time.\" No need to use \"leftover chicken\" to make me feel like I'm not worthy of new chicken.

She replied \"we don't have bread, just the focaccia appetizer\". We saw the table next to us ask for bread when they were eating salads and it was brought out to them and pointed that out to her. Her response was that it was crostini which was different than bread. We said we still wanted it and she literally looked SO angry that we would want to order it... took 10 minutes to come out, no exaggeration. Our pasta was getting cold as we were waiting for the bread to come out. When we saw our neighbors request it, it came to them within minutes.

We arrived at 5:45 and not only found two seats, but they had a few available at the counter where we could watch the cooks knock out pizza pies and serve up some amazing pasta and pork dishes. This would be useful in helping decide what to get. \n\nBut before food comes drink. The cocktail lists some creative libations and plenty of wines by the glass (all for $10). After a quick glance, my wife decided on the \"Crystal Beach\", served in a tall glass on the rocks it's a froofy drink with mint leaves. But this \"froofy\" drink is delicious and I would have no problem ordering it in the future. I went with my standard bourbon sidecar which was the perfect way to kickstart the weekend. \n\nWhile my wife and I sipped on our cocktails, we knew would have to make some decisions. And with our viewing angle of the open kitchen we were able to make what we thought were some great calls. We started out by sharing the Raviolo di ricotta with farm egg & brown butter. This dish is small but rich. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the egg on top helped round out one of the best starter dishes I have had in San Francisco in quite some time. \n\nFor our main we were all over the map. Literally every single dish we saw looked kicked ass delicious. The pizzas! Oh the Pizzas! I wanted you! But we went with the Spit roasted pork with roasted apples and red cabbage. This dish was a out of the park(pork) home run! A think slice of perfectly grilled pork loin, it reminded me of the juiciest prime rib you have ever tasted. A simply prepared dish with just a few ingredients, I would get it again in a heartbeat. \n\nWe finished off dinner by sharing a apple fritelle with bourbon toffee. It paired perfectly with the remaining bottle of '09 NEBBIOLO \"OCHETTI,\" RATTI. Speaking of wine, every bottle on the list is priced at $40. I loved this concept. This takes some of the awkwardness of ordering wine out the way. You know what I'm talking about. You are on a date and the wine list comes and it's loaded with $95-$200 bottles and there is like one $50 bottle  that you know nothing about and point to it on the menu asking your server if this bottle is \"any good\", or are there any like it that might be better. Cotogna does it right, just tell your server what kinds of wine you like and they will suggest the perfect bottle. \n\nThe dining room is rustic and much different than it's sister restaurant (Quince) next door.

Am also adding it to my list of nice restaurants in the city with good value.\n\nWe shared and would recommend the following:\n\n- Insalata Contadina - nice, fresh salad with good vinaigrette dressing\n- Pizze - sausage, caciocavallo and arugula - I love pizza so enjoyed this quite a bit\n- Raviolo di ricotta -- farm egg & brown butter - one decent size ravioli that was nicely done and not too greasy from the butter as I have had at other restaurants\n- tagliatelle alla bolognese - excellent sauce and pasta.  nice way to end before dessert\n- Apple crostata & salted caramel gelato - good, but pastry was a little harder than I would have liked\n- Gianduja bar & valrhona chocolate gelato - probably my favorite of the two desserts.  sounds rich, but surprisingly manageable", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["I know everyone raves about the raviolo di ricotta with farm egg & brown butter, but to me, it was a tad bit salty and very difficult to share since it's one large ravioli. \n\n"], "author": "Christina L.", "review": "I love this place - rich wood interior, high ceilings, and a nice, not-too-loud ambiance. This is innovative and fresh Italian food / pasta with a rotating menu, so you don't have to worry about being bored on repeat visits.\n\nI've been here twice and have not been disappointed either time. They have a great prix fixe of an appetizer, pasta dish and dessert for $26, which is a great deal.\n\nTheir focaccia is great, so make sure you ask for it with your meal - they won't just bring it to your table. I am surprised it's not brought out with olive oil, but it's tasty on its own and great for soaking up extra pasta sauce.\n\nFor 4 people, we ordered one prix fixe, one appetizer, one pizza, two pastas, and one dessert and it was sufficient food. I'd recommend doing everything family style so that you get a chance to try everything.\n\nThe menu changes fairly frequently, so it's hard to recommend specific dishes. During my visit (Aug 2013), the best dish we had was the corn triangoli ($17), which is a ravioli with corn. It has fresh ricotta inside, lots of melted butter and corn. This was definitely everyone's favorite pasta dish.  I've had the pappardelle with lamb rag\u00f9 ($17), which is good, but not mind-blowing. The pasta noodles are fresh, but it just has shredded lamb and parmesan cheese - I wish there were other complementing flavors. I know everyone raves about the raviolo di ricotta with farm egg & brown butter, but to me, it was a tad bit salty and very difficult to share since it's one large ravioli. \n\nThe pizzas are a good size, the sauce and toppings are always fresh. I do prefer Una Pizza Neapolitana, Del Popolo, and Zero Zero over this pizza, but it's filling, and they rotate toppings frequently. I just find the crust to be a tad bit soggier than my other favorites.\n\nWe had a scallop appetizer with sea urchin which was delicious - breaded scallop patties with greens, sauce, and little bits of sea urchin on top. We had a vanilla semifreddo and plum tartine for dessert which were both great.\n\nThe drinks are phenomenal - my favorite being the Blackberry Fix which had gin, ginger beer, blackberries, and other delicious things. It just tasted like blackberry juice and ginger beer. It may be one of the best drinks I've had in SF. It didn't even taste like alcohol - dangerous!\n\nAll in all, you can't really go wrong here.

I went with 2 of my girlfriends and we were thoroughly impressed with almost every dish:\n\n- Focaccia - love the salt on this bread and that they serve it to you already having soaked up some additional olive oil.\n\n- Oven roasted heirloom tomato w/ burrata, arugula, and roasted onion: absolutely awesome!  Simple but obvious they are using high quality ingredients\n\n- Pizza w/ uni, cauliflower, and jalapeno: probably the least favorite of the night. We were intrigued so we had to order it.  The pizza crust is really good, so I would recommend pizzas in general, but with different toppings.  Somehow it just didn't seem right to put the uni and cauliflower together, on a pizza no less.  Interesting concept...\n\n- Raviolo di ricotta w/ farm egg & brown butter: really rich so it was great for sharing. how they do this I don't know, but this dish is amazing\n\n- spit roasted pork - not as seasoned/flavorful as I had imagined, but still  juicy and the natural pork flavor was obvious.  a good dish\n\n- braised rabbit w/ capers, peppers, and polenta: my favorite of the evening!  Super tender rabbit and delicious polenta.  Everything was well-seasoned.  I typically have not liked rabbit in the past, but Cotogna's version was not very gamey, and almost like a cross between pork and chicken.  Very well executed.\n\n- Panna cotta with champagne grapes and saba: a very simple but elegant dessert.  The panna cotta was very smooth and creamy. Not too sweet and the grapes/saba were a great complement.\n\nAll these dishes and the bill came out to just under $90 before tip.

I've been scarred by too many underwhelming dining experiences at \"top rated\" restaurants in SF but Cotogna blew me away.  I am glad that my dining partners and I weren't afraid to go all out because every single dish was spectacular.  The restaurant is intimate and dimly lit.  Valet parking is available but I found street parking after circling around about 10 times.  It feels fancy but not pretentious and you can certainly get away with wearing casual clothing.  Now onto the food:\n\n1. Burrata with charred tomato - Delicious, can't go wrong\n\n2. Paine Farm squab with black rice & ember roasted beets - One of my favorite dishes of the night.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy meat on the inside\n\n3. Summer squash with gremolata - Ordered this because we realized we didn't order any vegetables.  So good.\n\n4. Raviolo di ricotta with farm egg - DECADANT.  Another top favorite.  Even though it only comes with one ravioli, it is best to split this dish amongst 3-4 people.  It is THAT rich.\n\n5. Pasta with nettles - I don't remember the official name but this was good too\n\n6. Gnocchi with wild mushrooms, stridoli &parmigiano reggiano fonduta - We were told that they used freshly picked potatoes.  There was definitely a significant difference from all of the gnocchi I've previously had.   The potato flavor was very strong - delicious!  And I normally don't care for gnocchi\n\n7. Bigoli neri with octopus, red wine & mint - WEIRD but the 3rd top contender of the night.  I always try squid ink pasta when I see it on the menu but have never liked it.  This was the first time I liked it.  Something about the combination with mint made it work\n\n8. \"Agnolotti dal plin\" - When I saw this plate, it made me think of mini purses made of pasta stuffed with rich meat.  So.  Good.\n\n9. squash blossom fritto - TOP CONTENDER OF THE NIGHT.  Lightly fried squash blossoms filled with cheese.  I thought that it would be too rich but it was surprisingly very light.  What a shame a plate only came with 4 blossoms.  I could have easily eaten 20 by myself.\n\n10. porchetta della casa - 2nd TOP CONTENDER OF THE NIGHT.  Very thick cut of porchetta with crispy pork skin (like a high quality version of pork rinds)\n\n11. Snap peas with spicy tomato sauce - Ordered because we needed vegetables.  Simple but so good!\n\n12. Chocolate semifreddo with chocolate nut crumble - Our stomachs were going to explode at this point but this was delicious as well\n\nOverall:  They do an amazing job of bringing out the natural flavors of the fresh ingredients without masking it with too much sauce and spices.

We came in tonight with a party of six, of which one person did her own thing and five of us did family-style, so we got to try as much as possible of what Cotogna had to offer.\n\nAppetizer-wise, we started out with three offerings.  I wasn't expecting much from the ricotta della casa, since I'm not wild about ricotta, but this blew me away.  The ricotto was warmed with hazelnuts and 490 honey, which gave the dish a subtle sweet flavor.  The top/torched layer had a slightly burned, flavorful depth and sweetness.  Then we got to the grilled squid with romaine lettuce, green farro, and almonds.  WHOA.  Just whoa.  This was another dish I went along with my party in terms of ordering.  I'm not usually that into squid.  This was so good that I want to see if I can sneak in by myself at 5:30 PM some day and order a la carte, if they continue to offer it (right now, it's on the daily specials menu).  And our final appetizer was the halibut crudo with bergamot, pear, and avocado.  I was most looking forward to this, but I was the least struck by it.  I still enjoyed it, but it had very mild/subtle flavors and felt less memorable/creative than the other appetizers.  (The person who decided to order a la carte got the spinach sformato, and she really liked it.)\n\nWe then did a round of pastas.  This was the highlight of the evening. I was truly impressed by the duck pappardelle - the pasta was so fresh and flavorful and well-complemented by the duck (NB: there could have been a bit more duck.)  The raviolo di ricotta with farm egg and brown butter was extremely good but very rich.  And the gnocchi with dungeness crab and meyer lemon -- again the dish I was most looking forward to in this round -- while good, did not impress me as much as the other two.  The gnocchi itself was well-made and the dungeness crab was sweet and flavorful, but somehow, the dish didn't seem to hold together.

Only foodies and would-be foodies would talk about a dish \"holding together.\"  But I think a real foodie would be able to explain why the dish wasn't quite \"holding together,\" and I can't.)\n\nWe concluded the savory portion of our meal with a round of pizza and sides.  None of us were blown away by the pizza puttanesca (with anchovies and olives), which is the main reason for the drop from five to 4.5 stars.  Multiple people at the table commented that the crust was a bit soggy, and the anchovies overpowered the dish.  The sides, on the other hand, were solid.  The brussel sprouts were crisp on the outside and rich with flavor.  The roasted sunchokes also did not disappoint.\n\nOf the desserts, I would most recommend the apple-quince crostata with rum raisin ice cream.  I'm not generally into sweet desserts, but I'd order this one again.  \n\nCocktail-wise, everyone seemed pleased. For gin lovers, I'd recommend the drink named \"London [something]\" that came with lime - a flavorful, citrusy drink with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Two people also ordered wine, and the waitress made an excellent chianti recommendation that matched the \"fruit forward without strong tannins\" request.\n\nService was both warm and accurate.

Crispy skin on the outside, juicy meat on the inside\n\n3. Summer squash with gremolata - Ordered this because we realized we didn't order any vegetables.  So good.\n\n4. Raviolo di ricotta with farm egg - DECADANT.  Another top favorite.  Even though it only comes with one ravioli, it is best to split this dish amongst 3-4 people.  It is THAT rich.\n\n5. Pasta with nettles - I don't remember the official name but this was good too\n\n6. Gnocchi with wild mushrooms, stridoli &parmigiano reggiano fonduta - We were told that they used freshly picked potatoes.  There was definitely a significant difference from all of the gnocchi I've previously had.   The potato flavor was very strong - delicious!  And I normally don't care for gnocchi\n\n7. Bigoli neri with octopus, red wine & mint - WEIRD but the 3rd top contender of the night.  I always try squid ink pasta when I see it on the menu but have never liked it.

Something about the combination with mint made it work\n\n8. \"Agnolotti dal plin\" - When I saw this plate, it made me think of mini purses made of pasta stuffed with rich meat.  So.  Good.\n\n9. squash blossom fritto - TOP CONTENDER OF THE NIGHT.  Lightly fried squash blossoms filled with cheese.  I thought that it would be too rich but it was surprisingly very light.  What a shame a plate only came with 4 blossoms.  I could have easily eaten 20 by myself.\n\n10. porchetta della casa - 2nd TOP CONTENDER OF THE NIGHT.  Very thick cut of porchetta with crispy pork skin (like a high quality version of pork rinds)\n\n11. Snap peas with spicy tomato sauce - Ordered because we needed vegetables.  Simple but so good!\n\n12. Chocolate semifreddo with chocolate nut crumble - Our stomachs were going to explode at this point but this was delicious as well\n\nOverall:  They do an amazing job of bringing out the natural flavors of the fresh ingredients without masking it with too much sauce and spices.

Fawned over by the Maitre d' due to my table-mate but not particularly benefitted by this save for the quail served with an apology for slow service it was largely with an eye on diversity that the rest of our meal progressed and flowing from lighter flavors to those more bold a common theme emerged, the perfect produce and light saucing far outperforming proteins I found to be generally overcooked and underportioned given the price - the tender tripe a lone exception, though still not on par with that at A16 or Delfina.  Focusing on the strengths of the meal it bears mention that the wood fired pizza deserves high praise for its seamless marriage of savory and sweet atop a smoky crust while Tusk's team again showed a deft hand with filled pastas in the silky Triangoli filled with what can best be described as cream corn veloute rife with butter and just a touch of aged cheese.

", "Lightly battered pieces of boneless chicken with pickled Romano beans. ", "Tuscan fried chicken was $24. "], "author": "Remus L.", "review": "Cotogna is an upscale casual eatery and the sister restaurant of SF favorite Quince. With the heat wave and long weekend, we thought it would be an opportune time to dine here for a late brunch without a wait...and we were right! \n\nTables were literally right next to each other. Some would call it cozy, I'd say it's crammed for max seating. The restaurant was half full and I could barely have a conversation with my dining companion because our neighbors were so close to us and had a lively conversation.\n\nOnto the food, we had the following courses:\n\n1) salad de nice, which came with some mushy/unidentifiable fish and anchovies, heirloom tomatoes, greens and an egg in a light vinaigrette. The table next to us was offered freshly ground pepper but we were not. Ding #1\n\n2) raviolo di ricotta - interesting pasta but super heavy. One ravioli filled with ricotta and a runny egg  and drenched in brown butter. If you haven't had this elsewhere, I'd recommend you order it; otherwise, skip it - I've had better renditions.\n\n3) corn and chive triangoli - better dish of the two pasta courses. While this was a solid dish, the chive was completely missed and did nothing.\n\n4) focaccia - I read on Yelp that this was a must get. Honestly, nothing to write home about. It's just bread!\n\n5) Tuscan fried chicken - The dish itself was fine. Lightly battered pieces of boneless chicken with pickled Romano beans. Decently seasoned and even the white meat was moist!\n\nSounds like an okay meal but why the two stars? Let me tell you why...\n\nWe over ordered and planned to take home the fried chicken. Our server took away our dishes and didn't ask if we wanted them packed up. She proceeded to bring us the check and I thought it was odd she didn't bring back our leftovers with the check. I inquired about our doggy bag and she gave this look of panic and quickly said, \"Oh let me check.\" Her look alone was enough for me to know what happened.\n\nI wish she would have just came clean and fessed up to what happened. Instead, we waited for about five minutes and the manager came over explaining what happened. Never once was she apologetic and instead said there must have been \"confusion\" and she didn't know we wanted to pack it home.\n\nHonestly, I could have cared less and would have said, \"Don't worry about it. These things happen.\" However, there was never an apology of any sort so I proceeded with the conversation below:\n\nMe: \"Well, the server never asked if we wanted it packed home.\"\nManager: \"Well, we never ask.\"\n\nYou're an upscale casual restaurant and I literally paid $113 for lunch with a $5 mandate...I wouldn't think it's uncommon to ask for a restaurant of your caliber. I've been to plenty of restaurants...whether it's The French Laundry, Puccino or Delfina or what not, servers have always asked if we wanted to pack home anything. \n\nTo add insult to injury, she then proceeds with:\n\nManager: \"We still have some 'leftover chicken' and we'd love to make it up if you have the time.\"\n\nOkay, why in the world would I want your \"leftover chicken.\" This sounds terrible and not only that but saying that you never ask a customer if they want to take something home is a horrible excuse. Change your policy to avoid confusion! \n\nWe declined her atrocious offer and said don't worry about it and the manager walks away. By now, I'm angry and repulsed that she made such an offer. I signed the bill and we get up to leave.\n\nThe manager comes back...Jesus Christ! What now?! Have you not said enough?\n\nManager: \"We'd like to make it up to you by at least comping your drinks.\"\nMe: \"Don't worry about it.\"\nManager: \"Is there anything else we can do?\"\nMe: \"No.\"\n\nTerrible. Don't even bother asking. You should have offered the comp when we declined your offer to make us \"leftover chicken.\" This just seems like a half hearted attempt to somewhat apologize.\n\nLet me quote figures for you. My husband had some sort of Italian soda and I had a lemonade. Total is at most $12. Tuscan fried chicken was $24. Do the math.\n\nOptically, this is what it seems like, \"It's not entirely our fault so we'll comp you half the cost of the dish.\"\n\nNo thank you. It's not about the cost or the food but more about principle. SF has many restaurants that I don't feel the need to come back and succumb to okay food with horrible service from management. \n\nYou know what would have been a better thing to say in this situation? Let me educate you...\"I'm sorry for the confusion and I'd love to make it up to you by having the kitchen remake an order for you if you have the time.\" No need to use \"leftover chicken\" to make me feel like I'm not worthy of new chicken.
