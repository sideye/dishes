Even having been there for years, it often feels like they want you in and out rapidly!

It is the most wonderful balance of sweet, savory and spicy I have ever had! \n\nNext your meal is served with your two choices, (I recommend the red beef curry, served in a small bowl on the plate, just hot enough that you have to eat it with a spoonful of rice in order to keep the temperature manageable to me). It amazing how much food  is held in that bowl and I still have one more entree in another bowl on my plate!\nMy second choice sometimes changes but primarily I go for the peppery fried pork which I dip in a sweet and hot sauce served on the side. Their satay is fantastic and their chicken in really tiny bits with fresh basil is also one of my favorites. \n\nFriends have raved over the BBQ chicken, the Pad Thai, and everyone raves about the soup!

We ordered a papaya salad, a beef dish (nur pad prik), pad thai, and mango sticky rice for dessert. \n\nMy partner isn't always a fan of Thai cuisine because he doesn't like spicy (as in \"hot\") dishes. I've learned to love spice over the years, and so can handle the default heat at a place like Lers Ros; however, all of the dishes at Manora's came out mild by default (per other Yelp reviews, it appears you can up the levels on request), which made for a much more enjoyable experience for him. \n\nThe papaya salad was one of the best ones I've tasted if not the best. Bright, fresh, tart, clean flavors. The dressing was so tasty that when we were done with the salad, I used my spoon to scoop up what remained of the dressing and drank it. Also drizzled it on my rice (which, BTW, you need to order separately if you want rice; I don't think it comes with any of the dinner time dishes). \n\nThe nur pad prik was a dish I've never tried before but we both enjoyed it immensely. The beef was tender and cooked nicely; the sauce was flavorful but as with the papaya salad, mild by default in terms of heat (which in no way diminished how tasty it was). \n\nPad thai is a dish I've gotten many times from many different restaurants and Manora's was great. Possibly a little bit on the sweeter side but also tangy and eggy, and as with all of the other dishes we ordered, packed with flavor. \n\nWe concluded with an order of the mango sticky rice, one of my favorite desserts of all time. The sticky rice part was perfection: the rice was served piping hot, the coconut sauce and crunchy bits added textural and flavor contrasts; however, the mango itself was the one weak spot in our meal. It was fine, but considering that mangos are in season right now, not nearly as good as other mangos I've had recently (in fact, it was the second mango of the day for me as I'd had one for breakfast and that one was much better -- tarter and more intensely mango-flavored). \n\nMango complaint aside, we would absolutely go back to Manora's again and plan to do so soon. My partner, who as I mentioned earlier, isn't always the biggest fan of Thai cuisine, said he would go back to try their lunch special if he's in the area, and that's actually saying a lot because he doesn't generally eat Thai food unless he's with me. \n\nOne final note: they have a bar area, but had no cocktails listed on the menu.

Seriously.  To compare, once I was in Connecticut, and drove an hour and a half to get to a Thai restaurant.   It takes 3 hours to drive through the entire state.  The white people I was with had never had Thai.... but that's another story entirely...  \n\nThankfully, San Francisco is only 6 miles in radius, so Manora is really pain-less to get to, even for people in the Peninsula.  The location is near all sorts of freeways and parking is easy.  Rainbow grocery is right across the way.  Rainbow sells no meat, so Manora is a good stop off for non-vegetarians, especially during lunch!  Dinner would be better though, because unless you're a complete lush, the Mai-tai's aren't to be missed.  They're cheap as well.   \n\nThey make the BEST yellow curry chicken with potatoes and onions I've ever had.  I judge all Thai restaurants on this dish, and none live up to Manora's curry.  The chicken is stew like and the spices are cooked perfectly.  The chef special of eggplant, chicken, shrimp, pork and basil in an oyster type sauce is delish, even if you don't like eggplant.  The Pad Thai is perfect, (most places screw it up)  There's a string bean and beef dish...  You get the point.  \n\nHave dinner, followed by many many cocktails, and walk down the street towards downtown, and go into the little clubs littering both sides of the street... if you're into that sort of thing.  I myself prefer Mai-tai's, dinner, more Mai-tai's and the other direction towards the Mission/Potrero, but that's what's so great about Manora.

Just as good if not better than the chicken dish. More savory, beautiful color and perfect with white rice. We went for medium spice, which was pretty mild for us. I would come back for these two dishes alone. 5/5\n\n*Pad Thai -- with how good the first two dishes were, we were expecting a pretty good pad thai, but this is where there was a drastic drop in quality. Reason being the excessive use of fish sauce. It tasted funky because they used way too much. My partner doesn't eat seafood, but loved pad thai. This took away the dish for him and I was left to finish all of it. Which I didn't do because the portion is HUGE. 2/5\n\nThe service is friendly. All the male servers wore tropical shirts, but it didn't quite go with the restaurant's ambiance. Of course that should not deter you.

It is the most wonderful balance of sweet, savory and spicy I have ever had! \n\nNext your meal is served with your two choices, (I recommend the red beef curry, served in a small bowl on the plate, just hot enough that you have to eat it with a spoonful of rice in order to keep the temperature manageable to me). It amazing how much food  is held in that bowl and I still have one more entree in another bowl on my plate!\nMy second choice sometimes changes but primarily I go for the peppery fried pork which I dip in a sweet and hot sauce served on the side. Their satay is fantastic and their chicken in really tiny bits with fresh basil is also one of my favorites. \n\nFriends have raved over the BBQ chicken, the Pad Thai, and everyone raves about the soup!

Food taste, quality and price is a solid Four Stars. Service on the other hand was Two Stars - very prompt but lacking in two areas: One, the server was rather terse overall and additionally seemed annoyed when we asked for an off menu item, and Two, the tea cups are small (but the tea is very good) and if you want a refill you have to keep asking them to come back and fill up your cup otherwise you will sit there with an empty cup in front of you.\nRecommended for the food, not for the service.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-03-07"}, {"excerpts": ["all of us had the best Thai iced tea ever...", "it was not too sweet so its perfect.

We happened to be in the neighborhood and were starving around 9:30pm. Manora's was open, so Manora's it was! I loved the decor and the authenticity as soon as we walked in.\n\nWe started with some hot tea, which was amazing! It was a red thai tea blend and smelled and tasted fabulous. We had the Yum Hed appetizer (combination of various types of mushrooms, prawn, and chicken in Thai spices, laid on a bed of greens), which was very good. It actually started sweet then went to spicy as we kept eating. Great flavor combination. We then shared 2 of the \"Chef's favorites\" dishes: the Pooket Skewer and the MaKeur-Paad-Prik. Now, I don't really like things too spicy, and I've never seen a server seem so disappointed and personally offended by me asking for something mild. I was a little perturbed by that, but the taste of the dishes easily made up for it. The skewers--with charbroiled scallop, prawn, fish, and vegetables with yummy dips--was amazing. And the Japanese eggplant in the other dish was perfectly done. My only real complaint is that they do not have brown rice, so we went with the jasmine rice, which was also really good. \n\nOf course, you can't have Thai food without having some mango with sticky rice, so indeed we ordered that as well. \n\nThe presentation, taste, service, and ambiance all surpassed my expectations for a corner place that was going to ease my late-night starvation. I will definitely be back!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-11-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Everything was wonderful, with the exception of the quail dish (can't bring myself to eat the State bird) and the Thai Ice Tea could have been better, I think I like those for the cream content, anyway."], "author": "Margaret R.", "review": "Great Thai food.
