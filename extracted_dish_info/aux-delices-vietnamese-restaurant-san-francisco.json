I was looking for parking in a 3 block radius on a weeknight  for about 20minutes until I found one.  Now if you can overlook the parking this restaurant is worthwhile.\n\nIt was really empty on a weeknight.  I heard it gets quite crowded but fortunately we found a day when there was no crowd.  We got seated in a booth with pillows at the end and cushions on the benches.  I thought it was a nice touch.  There were only 3 other tables occupied and there were two ladies next to us that were very loud, you could only imagine how much louder it would be with more people.  \n\nSo we ordered a sampler tray for starters.  It has Imperial Rolls, Dumplings, and Spring Rolls.  The Imperial Rolls and Spring Rolls were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The Dumplings were  odd to me and it was my first time tasting it.  It reminded me of Dim Sum, and basically was a noodle with ground beef inside.\n\nFor dinner we ordered a clay pot of pork and shrimp in a caramel sauce (Heo Va Tom Kho).  This was really good! The meat was very tender but not chewy.  The sauce was so good, I kept throwing it over my bowl of rice.  I would have been happy with 2 orders.  The other dish we ordered was (Bo Luc Lac) Beef filet mignon cubes lightly sauteed with garlic.  When my friend ordered it, I didn't know what to think, but when I tasted it.  Wow, the flavor really hits you as well as the tenderness of the meat.  \n\nThe price is very reasonable for two people at dinner.  The portions were just right and filling enough for us, but not enough to skip dessert.  We decided to get dessert elsewhere but with time running out and us getting tired we ended up retiring for the night.  \n\nI really enjoyed having dinner here and will most likely come back to try some of their other dishes and maybe improve their rating but if you are teetering whether or not to go here, I recommend you do.

So good!\n\nOur second favorite item on the menu are the imperial rolls - perfectly crispy on the outside! We also love ordering the different clay pot items, the chicken bean noodle soup, beef thai salad, papaya salad... pretty much anything here is delicious and you really can't go wrong.\n\nOver the years, Aux Delices is still my most favorite Vietnamese restaurant. It definitely helps that the ambiance is relaxing and is exceptionally clean for an asian restaurant.

So, 3 stars it is.\n\nWent here on a Friday night, as I was with a friend and meeting my girlfriend who had arrived separately, and early, and would not be seated until 'the rest of the guests' had arrived... Pet peeve, but, yeah... I get it.\n\nFirst impressions were: \n\n- Clean dining room\n- Decent ambience \n- Quick/friendly service\n- Large menu\n\nWe had one pescatarian, and one genetically predisposed hater of cilantro, so the first test was having the fresh spring rolls sans pork, and sans cilantro. Waiter didn't flinch, just said ok - no problem. First test passed... \n\nRolls arrived quickly! Shortly after our promptly served bottle of wine & beer, complete with a crisp, frosty beer mug. Bonus points here.... (I love frosty glasses) The rolls themselves were pretty good, obviously fresh given the dietary needs of my companions, but the dipping sauce was more reminiscent of a carmel, peanut sauce hybrid... A little runny, but overall decent taste-wise, but not my favorite... Luckily they brought along a little monkeydish of chili sauce that helped us through.\n\nFor my entree I ordered Bo Cari Thai, a spicy beef curry with coconut milk & basil sizzling in an iron pot... Not the most Vietnamese of choices, but the name and description sold me. It arrived as advertised, really really hot and still bubbling within the cast iron cauldron. The fragrance was killer, just what you'd hope it would smell like. First taste was very positive, well seasoned, great aromatics and a rich coconut broth. Beef was tender and flavorful, and the vegetables seemed to have a French julienne, which, given the name of the restaurant and Vietnamese food's history, made me happy. \n\nFor desert, one friend banana with coconut ice cream, and another fried banana with a Grand Marnier flamb\u00e9... Again with the French touch\u00e9s (get it?). The regular fried banana and coco ice cream arrived as advertised, but the flamb\u00e9 banana arrived next... The waiter quickly doused with booze, and set about to flamb\u00e9 right at the table. Took a little while, but he did well by it. I appreciated this little demonstration, as you don't see it much these days. Flavor-wise both were enjoyable, and pretty much how you'd expect them to taste. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nBill came to $100 for three entrees, one beer, one bottle of wine, two desserts, and one appetizer. Not bad at all. \n\nSummary? Well, Aux Delices will probably see me again... It wasn't overwhelmingly great, but had some moments of greatness and also a few of mediocrity. I am curious to explore the menu a bit more after seeing some other reviews, and will update this review accordingly (if need be).  \n\nIn general; solid food, good service, reasonable prices. \n\nEnjoy :)", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-01-12"}], "bo luc lac": [{"excerpts": ["Bo luc lac (filet mignon cubes) is one of my favorite dishes of all time and this one did not disappoint. \n\n"], "author": "Courtney N.", "review": "Delicious authentic Vietnamese food!

For once I was $hafted pretty hard! :-o. \n\nDid a quick search for Vietnamese in the city and looked at the hits. Aux Delices (The Delights?) came up with lots of positive write-ups of people who are connected to me. OK that's a start.\n\nWhipped up the trusty Yelp app on the Winblows Phone Nokia Lumia 920 (don't hate, it takes great pictures...but the app still needs further improvement) and decided to order the \"Yelp tourist\" tried and true dishes based on the tip$ offered.\n\nThe menu has a pretty broad spectrum, and doesn't appear to be your average pho and spring rolls shop. But it is also not like those fancy fusion super upscale type places either.\n\n6 pm on a Saturday night, and while parking was extremely scarce, the restaurant was otherwise rather quiet. \n\nPho Tai - comes in three sizes....tall, grande, venti. The \"tall\" size would be ok for a quick snack portion, kind of like really traditional old style won ton noodle shops in Hong Kong like Mak's on Wellington St in Central. Asked about other beef cuts, like tendon. Denied. Just straight up beef...and the beef was rather chewy and dry. At these prices and rent I'm not expecting fresh unfrozen beef but hey... decent broth, with bare minimal MSG if any, ok noodles, but mediocre beef. Recommended if you are not an adventurous eater.\n\nGarlic noodles - The toned down butter presence is perhaps heathier, but really needed more of a garlic kick. Otherwise this was saved (by me) with some non rooster chili sauce (which they provided in a little cylindrical holder with a spoon on the side).\n\nBo Luc Lac - Despite knowing that I might butcher the language, but not in a bad way, I ordered \"Bo Luc Laaahc\" with the Vietnamese waiter. And he replied back \"oh you want the Shaking Beef\" in his heavily accented English. I was like ok dude, whatever, I tried.

All I tasted was soy sauce, not enough black pepper and other seasonings, and a lack of an intensive wok sear and carmelization. DOH! (and that does not mean \"dude\" in gangsta speak).\n\nThe cha gio (fried spring rolls) I had were equally puzzling. Very dry and the exterior seemed a bit too solid and thick. Of course I wasn't expected the rice paper roll version fried. But is this neighborhood scared of fish sauce? It was not served with any (granted the cha gio were sampled from another bbq pork rice plate) and even some weak fish sauce would have improved the taste of the dry cha gio a bit.\n\nOrdered a caf\u00e9 sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk) and apparently it was forgotten until the end of the meal. I purposely did not ask to remind them since the meal wasn't exactly my style with the way it was going, but later waitstaff came back and apologized....so I got it in a to go cup. Not bad...at least it was indeed the drip kind (but already mixed and poured in), and not the vanilla caramel latte stuff like Lee's or Brodard in the OC.\n\nI'm not going to be the person who blames other reviewers for their good reviews.\nBut one thing of note, the 5 star glory days are mostly from 5 to 6 years back. Hmmm...\n \nPerhaps for lack of other options as well as the neighborhood this place is in, this would be ok. But absolutely not my style.

I was looking for parking in a 3 block radius on a weeknight  for about 20minutes until I found one.  Now if you can overlook the parking this restaurant is worthwhile.\n\nIt was really empty on a weeknight.  I heard it gets quite crowded but fortunately we found a day when there was no crowd.  We got seated in a booth with pillows at the end and cushions on the benches.  I thought it was a nice touch.  There were only 3 other tables occupied and there were two ladies next to us that were very loud, you could only imagine how much louder it would be with more people.  \n\nSo we ordered a sampler tray for starters.  It has Imperial Rolls, Dumplings, and Spring Rolls.  The Imperial Rolls and Spring Rolls were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The Dumplings were  odd to me and it was my first time tasting it.  It reminded me of Dim Sum, and basically was a noodle with ground beef inside.\n\nFor dinner we ordered a clay pot of pork and shrimp in a caramel sauce (Heo Va Tom Kho).  This was really good! The meat was very tender but not chewy.  The sauce was so good, I kept throwing it over my bowl of rice.  I would have been happy with 2 orders.  The other dish we ordered was (Bo Luc Lac) Beef filet mignon cubes lightly sauteed with garlic.  When my friend ordered it, I didn't know what to think, but when I tasted it.  Wow, the flavor really hits you as well as the tenderness of the meat.  \n\nThe price is very reasonable for two people at dinner.

We were staying in the neighborhood and walked by several times before deciding to stop in for dinner, in part because we were apprehensive about taking our 9 month old son to an \"upscale\" place.\n\nWe were more than delighted by the service we received. The staff was extremely considerate of our son's needs: his highchair was placed on a tablecloth when we were seated, and he was given a sippy cup of water and a small bowl of chicken porridge without us requesting either. He ate all of the porridge and clamored for bites of our food as well!\n\nAnd the food! My partner loves salmon but I hate it, so he makes a point to order it when we're out. He raved about his Caramel Salmon and insisted that I try it.

Aux Delices hit the perfect spot for those three criteria!\n\nThe casual and pleasantly decorated Vietnamese restaurant has these long booths which is conducive to group seating with plenty of table space for dishes and individual settings and swinging elbow room. Great for a group of 5-8 people.\n\nThe waitstaff are very sweet and attentive.

And he gave me the option to seat first or hang out. Before the group conversation gets too boisterous later in the dinner, I decided to be social one-on-one and introduce myself instead. Bold, bold, bold step for me, but it was definitely worth it to ease the selection and sharing of dishes.\n\nAux delices's dishes are plentifully set up for sharing! We had 5 people in our party, and everyone had a substantial taste for each dish.

Sometimes it's fantastic and sometimes it's not so good.  I've been here enough times to know the service isn't necessarily dependent on the server.  I've received good and bad service from the same staff members.  \n\nPho - Very good for SF.  Fresh ingredients.  However, portion size is laughable.  If you serve Pho, you need to offer the mega-size bowl for $1.00-$2.00 more than the mini bowl.  Those are the rules.  I didn't write them.  They don't even OFFER the mega-size bowl.  I know I'm going to be hungry an hour after eating it anyway, so there is no point in getting Pho unless the bowl is twice the size of my head. \n\nBun Cha Gio - Fried eggrolls on vermicelli.  Okay, granted this is not an uncomplicated dish, but it's easy to screw up the right proportion of noodles, to egg rolls, to cucumbers, cilantro, etc.  They do it well enough here that I've had it more than a handful of times.

We made a reservation for 6 and were easily accomodated.\n\nFor appetizers, we started with Cha Gio (Imperial Rolls). Chao Tom (Shrimp on Sugar Cane) and Banh Cuon (Steamed flat dumplings). The Imperial Rolls were fried to perfection, crispy but not overly oily. The Shrimp on Sugar Cane came with rice paper to assemble your own rolls, which was fun and everyone enjoyed! The Banh Cuon, nice and traditional, simple and delicious.\n\nWith dinner we ordered a bottle of Gruner Veltliner, perfect clean, crisp with a bright acidity that paired well with most our dishes. For dinner, we enjoyed BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Caramelized Clay Pot Catfish, Sauteed Garlic Green Beans, and Garlic Noodles....the garlic noodles were so good, we had to get another order! Yummerz! Everything is done to perfection, the Clay Pot Catfish came out hot and bubbling and the sauce was perfect drizzled over the garlic noodles. \n\nFor dessert, we all shared an order of fried bananas and coconut ice cream! Traditional, simple and utterly delicious! I should've gotten an extra scoop of coconut ice cream with it! :)\n\nOverall, the staff was friendly and attentive, Mr. Nguyen the owner himself took our order and was very nice along with all the waitstaff!
