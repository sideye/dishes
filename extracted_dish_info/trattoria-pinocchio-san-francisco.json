My wife and I have had special gatherings at Pinocchio's in the past. So when we had an event to go to in San Francisco at the beginning of July we jumped at the chance to visit one of our favorite Italian restaurants.\n \nWhen we entered it was 8:50pm and there was a total of 4 tables occupied and one person sitting at the bar picking up a to-go order.  The hostess passed empty tables to end up offering us one directly across from the entrance into the kitchen. When asked if we can move to another table she told us they were for bigger parties, but reluctantly moved us to a table across from the bar.\n\nMariano greeted us, served water and took our order.  Basically we didn't see him again until the bill came. The antipasto salad, veal parmesan and gnocchi were good.  However the bruschetta starter was an icy mixture on top of tasteless toast. \n\nShortly after we ordered,  a bridal shower party of 10 arrived. Their waiter is the one who brought us our entree while juggling his bridal party as well as his other 2 tables.  I wish I would have gotten his name but we were sitting there in shock and disbelief at the service.\nWhere was Mariano? He was hanging out at the front door with the unenthusiastic hostess and a mystery staff? manager (wearing a track suit)?\n\nThis mystery staff/manager/ was not only friends with our waiter Mariano, but he must be pretty high up in the Trattoria Pinocchio world.  He waltzed through the restaurant from the kitchen area, to behind the bar tasting various draft beers then back to the front door to hang out with Mariano all the while twirling his white earbuds. Walking past tables and waitstaff with about a foot of his earbud cord twirling and swinging it around.\n\nI could go on and but typing this review and reliving the awful experience is exhausting.\nBottom line is that the next time in San Francisco I will find another Italian restaurant to spend my time and money at.

However, I had some bites of my friends' Fettuccine Pollo Alfredo and the special w/Sausage and they were both SO TASTY. \n\nAfter dinner, the waiter brought us all complimentary Limoncello (SCORE!), and we ordered 1each of the deserts. The tiramisu was great, the creme brulee was yummy - but the best was the poached pears in DARK CHOCOLATE SAUCE. Omg. Why have I never ordered these before??? They were amazing. \n\nI'm marking this as a good dinner place in SF - there were a lot of restaurants around the area that looked cheesy/touristy, but this one proved itself to be better than its name.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-07-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Oh, and you MUST try the bruschetta(?) appetizer, i swear it might've even been better than the pasta, so packed with flavor!

While living in the SF Bay Area my wife and I would go here every Sunday for lunch and many times for dinner as well. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is wonderful as well. My favorite waiter is Antonio who has worked there for a while. Certain pastas are made fresh daily such as the gnocchi, tagliatelle and ravioli. \n\nGnocchi Enzo - One of my all time favorite dishes. Fresh homemade gnocchi in a gorgonzola cheese sauce. The sauces in this place have amazing flavor and the gnocchi literally melts in your mouth since it's made fresh. \n\nPenne Amatriciana - Their Amatriciana sauce is very different then other Amatriciana sauces I have had at Bay Area restaurants. The flavor is spectacular ! The pasta was cooked al dente which is the way it should be done. So may Italian restaurants in America and Americans in general seem to like their pasta overcooked. Try this dish and you will be addicted.\n\nButternut Squash Ravioli in cream sauce - The butternut ravioli is sometimes on the special menu and it is delicious. the ravioli is homemade and very fresh. The difference between boxed and homemade pasta is huge. There is no substitute for fresh pasta made daily. \n\nPasta Festa - Also on the special menu from time to time. My wife hade this meal and the pasta was tagliatelle with a cream sauce and seafood. It was delicious and the portions were huge as well.\n\nProsciuotto and Melone - I have started my meals frequently with this appetizer. The melon is always fresh and the prosciutto always top quality. The perfect balance between salt and potassium. Great flavor. Salt raises the blood pressure and potassium from the melon keep the blood pressure in check. This is a nice, fresh, cold appetizer.\n\nI miss San Francisco and this restaurant especially along with Trattoria La Siciliana. two of my favorite haunts. When I die I plan on haunting this place and stealing pasta from patrons' dishes lol. You can't go wrong with any of the food here. Prices are higher for some dishes but the pastas are made fresh and I would imagine the rents in North Beach are quite high.\n\nCarpaccio - Another winning appetizer. beef sliced super thin with arugula, capers and bread and shaved cheese. The flavor is great when you put them all together.\n\nPanini Sandwiches - If you choose any of the Panini sandwiches you can't go wrong.

While living in the SF Bay Area my wife and I would go here every Sunday for lunch and many times for dinner as well. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is wonderful as well. My favorite waiter is Antonio who has worked there for a while. Certain pastas are made fresh daily such as the gnocchi, tagliatelle and ravioli. \n\nGnocchi Enzo - One of my all time favorite dishes. Fresh homemade gnocchi in a gorgonzola cheese sauce. The sauces in this place have amazing flavor and the gnocchi literally melts in your mouth since it's made fresh. \n\nPenne Amatriciana - Their Amatriciana sauce is very different then other Amatriciana sauces I have had at Bay Area restaurants. The flavor is spectacular ! The pasta was cooked al dente which is the way it should be done. So may Italian restaurants in America and Americans in general seem to like their pasta overcooked. Try this dish and you will be addicted.\n\nButternut Squash Ravioli in cream sauce - The butternut ravioli is sometimes on the special menu and it is delicious. the ravioli is homemade and very fresh. The difference between boxed and homemade pasta is huge. There is no substitute for fresh pasta made daily. \n\nPasta Festa - Also on the special menu from time to time. My wife hade this meal and the pasta was tagliatelle with a cream sauce and seafood. It was delicious and the portions were huge as well.\n\nProsciuotto and Melone - I have started my meals frequently with this appetizer. The melon is always fresh and the prosciutto always top quality. The perfect balance between salt and potassium. Great flavor. Salt raises the blood pressure and potassium from the melon keep the blood pressure in check. This is a nice, fresh, cold appetizer.\n\nI miss San Francisco and this restaurant especially along with Trattoria La Siciliana. two of my favorite haunts. When I die I plan on haunting this place and stealing pasta from patrons' dishes lol. You can't go wrong with any of the food here. Prices are higher for some dishes but the pastas are made fresh and I would imagine the rents in North Beach are quite high.\n\nCarpaccio - Another winning appetizer. beef sliced super thin with arugula, capers and bread and shaved cheese. The flavor is great when you put them all together.\n\nPanini Sandwiches - If you choose any of the Panini sandwiches you can't go wrong.

It was delicious. The pesto was great. I sopped up a lot of it with the complementary bread. My main complaint is that it's not very texturally diverse so it became harder to eat as I got deeper into the dish. All the gnocchi are the same texture. Though as it got colder, it didn't melt in my mouth as easily. The pesto sauce, while tasty was just saucy. They tried to add texture with pine nuts sprinkled in there but it wasn't enough. That's why I tried to have the bread with the pesto sauce too. Maybe if you were to get this, I would split this and another entr\u00e9e with someone else.

We walked until we found one that looked authentic with decor and menu.  We were not disappointed!!  The pasta is made from scratch and you can tell!  I had the tortellini stuffed with veal in a cream sauce with peas, mushrooms and pancetta.  Excellent!!  My husband enjoyed the lasagna made with veal.

The red-haired host is to blame. I have never met someone that is so rude; I usually let people slide on rudeness for the most part because I am passive, but she was just terrible.\nFirst, she put us at a small table when there was five of us. She said there was no other tables in the restaurant (except the four open ones I saw in the back five minute later on my way to the bathroom). We said we would wait. My mother-in-law was freezing and wanted to move. We said we were willing to wait. She responded by saying it wasn't cold in the restaurant and we were lucky to even be getting a table. Not good business manners in my opinion. Then my mother-in-law that the restaurant felt cold to her and she wanted to move regardless. The host then rolled her eyes, turn and walked away. To add to the kicker as she was walking away she said very loudly \"oh Jesus Christ.\" I think she didn't think we would hear, but we did. So rude. Then she went up to the host stand and complained to a server about us. Small restaurant and this was very obvious. When my mother-in-law got up to talk to her to tell her she was being rude to us, she responded that we were being rude. Does she not understand that we are the customers and she needs to be accommodating. I'm not saying that moving us wasn't going to be a little bit of a hassel, but I mean come on.\nThe server on the other hand was a doll. I can't remember his name. I think he said he has worked there three years. He apologized for her. His service was fantastic. Very sweet and attentive. The food was good as well. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. And the dessert is some of the best i've tasted. We got the cannoli and the mousse. The server really saved our experience and made it more enjoyable. However, the host might have been enough for us to never go back.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-07-13"}, {"excerpts": ["For desert we ended up enjoying several more Black Russian Capucino's and an order of cannoli.

The manager was standing outside the front door, and with a welcoming smile and a booming voice with an Italian accent invited us inside.\n\nWe each enjoyed a Black Russian Cappucino and a connoli.  The coffee drinks were very, very good, and the connoli was delightful and delicious.  We decided to make dinner. reservations for the following evening.\n\nWhen we arrived for dinner we decided to eat outside, and our hostess made sure the patio heater over our table was working.  It was a great place to enjoy the last of a great summer day and some people watching.  We order calamari for an appetizer, along with a bottle of red wine, which seemed very reasonably priced.  The calamari came with two sauces, a spicey red sauce as well as a pretty standard tasting tartar sauce.  It was well prepared, lightly breaded and very good.\n\nThe bartender had told us the evening before that they make all of their own pasta. I ordered the lobster and crabl ravioli and my wife ordered the veal and porcini ravioli.  My ravioli were delicious and I felt the sauce was perfect, and my portion was just right for me.  My wife thought her ravioli were delicsious, but thought the sauce was a tad too rich when combined with the already pretty rich veal.  She very much enjoyed it though.  For desert we ended up enjoying several more Black Russian Capucino's and an order of cannoli.  The coffee drinks here are just over the top good, and the cannoli was once again very, very good.\n\nOur service was perfect, and there is not much room for improvement.  Our water was kept topped off, and someone showed up just in time to keep our wine glasses full as well.  We were allowed to enjoy a very liesurely pace and linger with our coffee drinks afterwards as we interacted with some of the great staff.  It seems that most of the staff is very much Italian and very passionate about the quality of food that they are serving.\n\nThough there are some other great looking choices for Italian in the North Beach area this place really impressed us and we will visit again when in the San Francisco area.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-06-24"}], "vanilla creme brule": [{"excerpts": ["For dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Creme Brule with two espressos, which was the perfect way to end such a wonderful meal.

Then we each had the homemade pasta dishes, mine was the spinach and ricotta ravioli, my husband had the ciopppino and a sid order of pasta bolonese, both delicious and my daughter had the gnocchi Enzo, which was light and fluffy, but he sauce was a little too rich, she was wishing she had chosen a lighter tomato based sauce.
