", "You can request NO MSG be made with you food (YAY!). "], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Chinese Village Food? LOVE IT!\n\nMy mom grew up in one of the villages in China and introduced me to this type of cuisine early on. Apparently, this type of cuisine has a name, Hakka Cuisine which is what Hakka Restaurant (opened in January 2010) is named after; I learn something new every day. \n\nHakka Cuisine can be attributed to environmental influences. To make up for the huge loss of salt content in their body from farming, Hakka migrants added more salt to food which also preserved the food longer. These qualities meet the nature of the Hakkas. This is why you will find several salt baked and salty egg yolk items on Hakka Restaurant's menu. \n\nBeing the typical non-American born Asian, my mom believes in penny pinching and even a $5 bowl of wonton noodle soup she considers expensive. Needless to say, the only restaurants we went to were Chinese ones that offered $2.99, $3.99, and $4.99 main entree dishes (it's no wonder I now have severe allergies to MSG). Some of the Hakka-type dishes at these restaurants were not very authentic to say the least so Hakka Restaurant was a real treat for me. \n\nOn Sunday, 11.13.11, my friend and I came to Hakka for dinner at 6:30 PM with reservations. It's very busy and chaotic on weekends, so RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST!\n\nF O O D\nHakka is NOT a place to order sweet & sour pork, kung pao chicken, or chow mein (not sure if they even have that on the menu). Please save that for PF Chang's or Panda Express. \n\nTheir most popular dishes are the lettuce cups with squab, salty egg yolk pumpkin strips, salty egg yolk crab, salt baked chicken, pork belly with preserved mustard greens, and house special pan fried tofu. You can request NO MSG be made with you food (YAY!). Since it was just my friend and I, we ordered the following: \n\n*HOT & SOUR SOUP (6.95) - 4 STARS\nWarm and comforting, the hot & soup had an assertive sourness but wasn't overwhelming. The heat was just enough to awaken our tastebuds and leave a subtle heat on our palate. Bits of wooden ear fungus and tofu gave the soup some texture.\n\n*SALTY EGG YOLK LOBSTER ($25.95) - 4 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pknqZiaDbSNFUnJrOpkKcw?select=SjRBhrPYxhYA0QEtRPGwzA\nThey didn't have crab available that night so we went for the lobster instead. An unlikely combination, the fried salty egg yolk crust adds a crispy texture contrast to the tenderly moist lobster. Together, the egg yolk and lobster married together creating a mouth-watering salty and sweet flavor.\n\n*BRAISED PORK BELLY w/ Preserved Mustard Greens ($12.95) - 4.5 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pknqZiaDbSNFUnJrOpkKcw?select=o4ly8CJ04DTJtE3xeRNdMQ\nThe thick slices of pork belly were perfectly braised to a soft, melt-in-your-mouth butteryness. The sweet soy braising liquid imparted a lip-smacking savoryness with a hint of sweetness into the intensely rich pork. The mild sourness of the preserved mustard greens nicely cut through the richness of the pork belly.\n\n*BEAN SPROUTS w/Garlic ($8.95) - 3.5 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pknqZiaDbSNFUnJrOpkKcw?select=Ur8Cfx0CC7_iRyoZ34eKfA\nSimilar in appearance to spinach, the bean sprouts had a crisper texture and a milder flavor. The slices of garlic added a nice essence but were a little bland as we requested all our dishes to be made without MSG.\n\nS E R V I C E\nFast and inattentive which is very typical of most Chinese restaurants. They were VERY busy so you had to wave your hand in the air if you wanted something. Hakka is a place where you come for the food and the food only so don't expect good customer service.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nLOUD AND CHAOTIC! Being part Chinese even I was in a bit of a culture shock when I walked into Hakka. People were shoving each other and anxiously awaiting their table. If you're unfortunate enough to be sitting at the tables near the entrance, expect people lingering and looking over into your table. There are two levels with mostly large round tables for family dinners. \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking is VERY difficult to find since Hakka is located in a residential neighborhood. Do give yourself an extra 10-15 minutes to look for parking. \n\nNext time, I'm coming with a village of people so we can go on a Hakka rampage!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-11-17"}, {"excerpts": ["The dish just screams \"heart attack!\"\n\nHouse Special Pan Fried Tofu - again, I'm not a fan of stuffed tofu, but I liked this one. "], "author": "Virg Y.", "review": "So THIS is what Hakka Cuisine is supposed to taste like...ahhh so!\n\nI've been making five spice chicken (a traditional Hakka dish) using those packets in the red box that you get at the Asian store for ages. I liked it fine, but tonight I don't think I can ever go back to it. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into here. Hakka food is more \"homey\" than fancy. This type of food uses a lot of sauces, involves fatty cuts of meat, and incorporates lots of dried oysters (or so I thought, judging from what I've had...and I really don't like dried oysters.)\n\nBUT...this place suited me quite well. It has some serious \"wok hay\" meaning you can taste the intense flavor that a well oiled, well heated wok can impart to food. Our party included a bunch of Hakka people, and I kept hearing people say, \"oh yeah, that is close to what I remember.\"\n\nHere's a run down of what we had. It's a long list and will make us look like pigs, which we are, but we also had a lot of people. Ok...anyhoo, here goes:\n\nPineapple Spareribs - a bit crunchy, not fatty, tangy sweet sauce...pretty good rendition.\n\nBeef Ox Tail - tender, good flavor, almost as good as my mom's. \n\nChinese Bacon w/Preserved Green - I NEVER touch this stuff. I've had it once in a fast food sort of place where they scoop food into a box; it was nasty. But THIS version was pretty good...despite the fatty cut of meat, I really enjoyed the greens and the whole dish, though I gingerly took very little each time (only reached for it twice). The dish just screams \"heart attack!\"\n\nHouse Special Pan Fried Tofu - again, I'm not a fan of stuffed tofu, but I liked this one. It's the silky but firm tofu with a meat center, nicely browned in the pan with a sauce over it.\n\nSalt & Baked Chicken - This is the five spice chicken thing that I mentioned earlier. Light but so flavorful, this chicken is what the Hakka people meant for it to taste like when they invented it. \n\nOyster w/Ginger & Scallion - pan fried to a crisp...eat these oysters with some of the copious amounts of scallion that the chef throws into the wok. \n\nEgg Fu Yong Shrimp - I didn't know Egg Fu Yong was a Hakka tradition. This one was good, but the least of my favorites. \n\nSatay Chicken Diced w/Eggplant - mmmm, yummy sauce...a bit sweet and kept piping hot in its own clay pot. \n\nSauteed Chinese Broccoli w/Rice Wine - a staple in Chinese restaurants....very fresh and stir fried to a crisp.\n\nFor those of you watching your carbs, beware! Hakka cuisine is one of those styles of Chinese cooking that makes you fill your rice bowl way too many times. The sauces are just so yummy that you have to have something to absorb all of them.\n\nAnd yes...we did finish almost all of the food we ordered. Scary but true. Plus two containers of rice. Oh and it was a deal too...$100 for all that food I mentioned. That was enough for nine or ten people.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-04-08"}, {"excerpts": ["- House special pan fried tofu.

I am a Hakka-nese so I think I'm some what qualified to say that it's not completely authentic but close. Authenticity aside, when it comes to taste, trust the professionals. \n\nTonight we brought 6 seniors relatives along, including 2 line cooks with 30 years of experiences combined and a 40 years experienced home-chef!\n\nOrdered 8 courses:\n\n- Fried crab with pumpkin and salted duck egg yolk. Everyone dug in with both hands. The best in the Bay Area. The crab is a bit small, less than 2 pounds. So they comp it with extra pumpkin strips. Loved it!\n- House special steamed chicken. Served as an cold app with 2 sauces. All chefs thought it's great. Nit picking: they used food coloring on the skin.\n- Honey BBQ short ribs. Super tender and very rich in the unique favor of a super hot work (wok-hey).\n- Chinese bacon with preserved green. Different than the Northern Chinese style. Less fatty and less salty. \n- House special pan fried tofu. The last time was better but still not bad.\n- House special clams. Essentially, wet fried clams in basil and garlic sauce. Great basil taste! Perfect to go down with white rice. \n- Cat fish in clay pot. Nice texture with sweet sauce. Lots of scallions.\n- Sauteed Chinese broccoli with rice wine. Last but not lease!\n\n\nComments from our guest:\n\nCook A ...\n- Short ribs. His wife just can't make it in such quality.\n- Tofu. A hint of dried fish in the mix of the meat but not to his taste.\nConclusion: Overall, he enjoyed it very much.\n\nCook B...\n- Bacon with preserved green. Different than the usual and he thought the preserved green is very tasty.\n- Cat fish. He couldn't stop eating the scallions.\n\nHome-chef...\n- Pumpkin. She wanted more and more of it.\n- The comp soup. Unique and not lacking of ingredients like other house soup.\n- Tofu. I'm sure she can make it better.\n\nThe girlfriend...\n- Cat fish. Never had cat fish clay pot as good.\n\nEVERYONE...\n- The crab is GREAT! Hands down!\n- The chicken dish is something you can hardly find in the Bay Area.\n\n\nIn Chinese, it's considered to be impolite to criticize the dishes when you're not the one who's paying the bill. At the end of the meal tonight, everyone was trying to pick their least favorite.

Lots of fat, but also lots of awesome.  Very good flavor, and nice tenderness.  I enjoyed the pickled / pressed vegetables as well - a lot of our dishes had this, which I learned is common in Hakka cuisine.\n\nThe salt baked chicken was probably my favorite dish.  The sauce that came with the chicken was what did it for me.\n\nGreen beans were pretty standard.  Nothing special, but not bad.\n\nThe steamed eggplant with garlic was probably my least favorite dish.  Some people that I ate with enjoyed it, but I thought the eggplant was too mushy and the flavors didn't come through well enough.\n\nWe were surprised when they charged us $1 per person for white rice.  In my book, it should come with any Chinese meal.  Oh well.  The rest of the meal was reasonably priced, though.\n\nThe service was prompt.  Not the friendliest, but Chinese waiters at Chinese restaurants always seem busy and have no time for you.
