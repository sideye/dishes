Sydney is not shy of Thai restaurants, but they have nothing on this place. It is in a great area and always hits the spot.\n\nI must admit  that I don't often stray from my personal favourites. Not because I don't want to try the rest of the menu, but I would feel guilty for foregoing the pineapple fried rice, angel wings, or signature Thai iced tea. I have never left unsatisfied!\n\nThe portions are good, prices are fair, atmosphere is comfortable and the experience is memorable!\n\nLooking forward to my next trip home. yumm!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-09-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Angel Wings\n"], "author": "Clifford L.", "review": "Gem of the Castro!\n\nAngel Wings\nAngel Prawns\nCalamari salad\nBBQ beef salad\nPad See Eiw (Pork Chow Fun)\nTamarind Fish\nJasmine rice\n\nThe cook has redeemed herself/ The previous 2 visits were disappointing & embarrassing.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-03-08"}], "thailand ruam mit": [], "gang kiew wan": [], "pa nanang": [], "gang deng": [], "gang garee gai": [], "gang ped yang": [], "gang deng salmon": [], "gai song kreung": [], "gai him ma pan": [], "nuea yang": [], "ped yang nam peung": [], "pad kao pod": [], "pad khing": [], "pad prik khing": [], "pad broccoli": [], "pad ma keau": [], "pad prik": [], "pad ga praw": [], "gra tieam prik tai": [], "pla muk ga praw": [], "pla muk choop pang tod": [], "pla muk ga tieam": [], "goong ga tieam": [], "goong pea seau": [], "choo chee goong": [], "pra ram goong": [], "pad woon sen goong": [], "pla raad prik": [], "pla saam ros": [], "pad talay": [], "goong ga praw": [], "thailand duck": [], "spicy seafood curry in clay pot": [], "ga praw talay": [], "ga praw duck": [], "fish ball noodles soup": [], "seafood noodles soup": [], "pad thai woon sen": [], "raad na": [{"excerpts": ["While the curries are a hit & miss a few times I was there, their Pad Thai and Raad Na have been excellent for the most part.\n\n"], "author": "Andy P.", "review": "To be honest, Thai Chef has never disappointed nor pleasantly surprised me.\n\nThey offer the traditional dishes found in other Thai restaurants.

I am sure that you will find cheaper prices if you opt to walk around Tenderloin and other seedy parts of the city.  \n\nThe staff (waiters/waitresses, servers and bussers) are always very friendly.  They are very easy to talk to, and offer suggestions when asked.  I have always thought Thai people are nice and respectful and folks here do just that!  They cannot pass by your table without smiling!  \n\nThe place itself is very well-lighted, but dim enough so there's an air of romance should you decide to bring a date with you.  I have, at times, seen couples (straight and gay) holding hands or gazing at each other's eyes.
