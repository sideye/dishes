YA! AND IT'S DELICIOUS MINUS THE PLANE RIDE! \n\nThanks to the lack of communication by Schmidt's closure for private event on Sunday evening, we came to Walzwerk instead and had a great German dinner. By far, the best German food I had in SF.\n\nWe walked in with no reservation and the place was packed on a Sunday night at 8pm. We got lucky as a table just opened up and we got seated immediately. There were 3 of us so we decided to order everythign to share family style. We ordered:\n\n1. SMALL POTATO PANCAKES WITH CHIVE SOUR CREAM AND APPLESAUCE. \n\nWOW! Best potato pancakes I've ever had. The outter layer is crispy, but in the inside is creamy and fluffy. The chive sour cream is a great match and it really brings out the flavor of the potatoes. \n\n2. SOLJANKA (TOMATO - CABAGE SOUP WITH SALAMI, BACON & \nPICKLES)\n\nI ordered this because I love soup. This is a little too sour for my taste bud, but friends and family know that I can't really take anything too sour. But the broth is very hearty, very flavorful. It has a strong tomatoes flavors and the salami and bacons are salty, which makes the soup so appetizing. \n\nWe ordered 3 entrees and shared them family style:\n\n3. GRILLED TH\u00dcRINGER BRATWURST SERVED WITH MASHED POTATOES & SAUERKRAUT\n\nWow! I love Bratwurst and this one is dynamite. The sausage casing is seared to crispy and so flavorful. The meat mixture is great. Mashed potatoes are so creamy and the sauerkraut is nicely marinated, but still retained a good slightly crunchy texture of the cabbage. If you haven't have fresh sauerkraut (no, not the bottled stuff you get from the supermarket for your BBQ dogs), you have to try these sauerkraut. You will never eat the bottled stuff ever again. \n\n4. SAUERBRATEN (MARINATED BEEF) WITH POTATO DUMPLINGS AND BRAISED RED CABBAGE\n\nI thought this dish was only ok for me mainly because it was a little sour, but the beef slices were very tender and you can cut it with a folk. It has great flavors and the sauce is very hearty. The potato dumplings (German's version of the Italian's gnocchi) were so fluffy and covered in creamy sauce. \n\n5. SCHNITZEL (BREADED PORKLOIN) WITH MASHED POTATOES & \nSTEWED GREEN BEANS\n\nThe Schnitzel (German version of the Japanese tontatsu or pork cutlet) has a very thin breading on the outside layer, but fried to perfect golden brown and crispy and the meat is still moist on the inside. The green beans were heavenly. \n\n6. APPLE STRUDEL WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM\n\nGreat puff pastry and the stuffing was apples, some nuts and I think raisins? It was all good and came out nice and hot.\n\nTotal bill $120 for the 3 of us including tax and tips for all the food above, 3 beers and 2 apple scholes (really delicious apple juice). Not bad at all and more importantly we all had a great meal and our half German friend really enjoyed his dinner. Everything was well made, very authentic (yes, we speak from experience of dining in Germany) and our server, Francis was super nice and very helpful when it comes to helping us decide on which beer to order from their very extensive all German beer menu. \n\nThe moral of my story is -- sometimes a backup plan can turn out to be better than the original plan. \n\nYes, we'll be back definitely.

There are no kitten heels or cosmos in sight.  The decor is a delightful hodgepodge of all things German, from propoganda posters to kitchy accessories.  Tables are mix and match, just like the eclectic clientele who loyally keep the restaurant busy every night.\n\nFirst, start with one of their many delicious beers - my husband likes the Optimator, while I prefer the amber.  You can't go wrong with a Weisse beer on a summer day - I can't think of anything more refreshing.\n\nFor appetizers, the potato pancakes are wonderful - thick and hearty, with sour cream and applesauce on the side.  Big enough to share, if you're feeling generous.  \n\nThe house-cured salmon is also lovely, with triangles of brown bread and a big bowl of beets on the side.\n\nThe soljanka soup is a real treat - a mix of pickled vegetables in a nice broth with bits of sausage thrown in - warms you up instantly and has a sour/savory flavor that is unique and very tasty.\n\nFor dinner, be sure to check the specials menu, because you can't go wrong with one of the fresh fish or pork selections.\n\nFavorites from the regular menu include:  Jaeger Schnitzel with Creamy Mushroom Sauce, Sauerbraten (Marinated Beef), Breast of Chicken stuffed with Apples & Bacon, Roast Pork.    If sausages are your thing, of course there is a great selection of those as well.\n\n**Vegetarians please note:  the Vegitarian Schnitzel is really good - a must-try!**\n\nDesserts:  Love the Cold Dog - layers and layers of cake & chocolate - almost a cross between a cake & a cookie, and the Apple Strudel is very good, too.  Again, there are usually specials such as cheesecake and chocolate pudding - all excellent.\n\nEven if you don't think you like German food, give Walzwerk a try.

Not a fan of German bread because of that grainy texture. \n\nE N T R E E S\n*J\u00e4gerschnitzel: Unbreaded porkloin w/ sp\u00e4tzle, creamy mushroom sauce ($16): http://bit.ly/1HYQGSP\n*Kassler: Smoked pork chop w/ mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts ($18): http://bit.ly/1ScwCUT\n\nThe entrees are the star of Walzwerk's menu. Everybody loved their entr\u00e9e. They're huge, hearty, and comforting. My J\u00e4gerschnitzel (unbreaded) was tender and showered in this sinfully delicious creamy mushroom sauce (great depth of flavor).

We also ordered the Rote Gr\u00fctze Berry Pudding  (sorry, no pic) which I wouldn't recommend. The \"pudding\" was watery and very tart. \n\nIt was packed on a Saturday night and there were only two waitresses who rocked it. They were knowledgeable and quick on their feet. They also have their sh*t together in the kitchen as we got all our dishes very timely. \n\nI've been to Walzwerk before my Yelp days and it's just as good as I remembered it.

I was expecting more flavor but didn't get it.\n\nThe kartoffelpuffer came next.  We shared these potato pancakes served with a side of sour cream and applesauce.

By far, the best German food I had in SF.\n\nWe walked in with no reservation and the place was packed on a Sunday night at 8pm. We got lucky as a table just opened up and we got seated immediately. There were 3 of us so we decided to order everythign to share family style. We ordered:\n\n1. SMALL POTATO PANCAKES WITH CHIVE SOUR CREAM AND APPLESAUCE. \n\nWOW! Best potato pancakes I've ever had. The outter layer is crispy, but in the inside is creamy and fluffy. The chive sour cream is a great match and it really brings out the flavor of the potatoes. \n\n2. SOLJANKA (TOMATO - CABAGE SOUP WITH SALAMI, BACON & \nPICKLES)\n\nI ordered this because I love soup. This is a little too sour for my taste bud, but friends and family know that I can't really take anything too sour. But the broth is very hearty, very flavorful. It has a strong tomatoes flavors and the salami and bacons are salty, which makes the soup so appetizing. \n\nWe ordered 3 entrees and shared them family style:\n\n3. GRILLED TH\u00dcRINGER BRATWURST SERVED WITH MASHED POTATOES & SAUERKRAUT\n\nWow! I love Bratwurst and this one is dynamite. The sausage casing is seared to crispy and so flavorful. The meat mixture is great. Mashed potatoes are so creamy and the sauerkraut is nicely marinated, but still retained a good slightly crunchy texture of the cabbage. If you haven't have fresh sauerkraut (no, not the bottled stuff you get from the supermarket for your BBQ dogs), you have to try these sauerkraut. You will never eat the bottled stuff ever again. \n\n4. SAUERBRATEN (MARINATED BEEF) WITH POTATO DUMPLINGS AND BRAISED RED CABBAGE\n\nI thought this dish was only ok for me mainly because it was a little sour, but the beef slices were very tender and you can cut it with a folk. It has great flavors and the sauce is very hearty. The potato dumplings (German's version of the Italian's gnocchi) were so fluffy and covered in creamy sauce. \n\n5. SCHNITZEL (BREADED PORKLOIN) WITH MASHED POTATOES & \nSTEWED GREEN BEANS\n\nThe Schnitzel (German version of the Japanese tontatsu or pork cutlet) has a very thin breading on the outside layer, but fried to perfect golden brown and crispy and the meat is still moist on the inside. The green beans were heavenly. \n\n6. APPLE STRUDEL WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM\n\nGreat puff pastry and the stuffing was apples, some nuts and I think raisins? It was all good and came out nice and hot.\n\nTotal bill $120 for the 3 of us including tax and tips for all the food above, 3 beers and 2 apple scholes (really delicious apple juice). Not bad at all and more importantly we all had a great meal and our half German friend really enjoyed his dinner. Everything was well made, very authentic (yes, we speak from experience of dining in Germany) and our server, Francis was super nice and very helpful when it comes to helping us decide on which beer to order from their very extensive all German beer menu. \n\nThe moral of my story is -- sometimes a backup plan can turn out to be better than the original plan. \n\nYes, we'll be back definitely.

Big enough to share, if you're feeling generous.  \n\nThe house-cured salmon is also lovely, with triangles of brown bread and a big bowl of beets on the side.\n\nThe soljanka soup is a real treat - a mix of pickled vegetables in a nice broth with bits of sausage thrown in - warms you up instantly and has a sour/savory flavor that is unique and very tasty.\n\nFor dinner, be sure to check the specials menu, because you can't go wrong with one of the fresh fish or pork selections.\n\nFavorites from the regular menu include:  Jaeger Schnitzel with Creamy Mushroom Sauce, Sauerbraten (Marinated Beef), Breast of Chicken stuffed with Apples & Bacon, Roast Pork.

To get there, I had to change 25 West German Deutschmarks for 25 East German ones, which at first didn't bother me, but at the time, people were pretty excited about some wall coming down or something and East Berlin was basically a ghost town as all the East Germans were over in West Berlin buying Japanese electronics at inflated prices, drinking coca-cola and reveling a bit too much in the joys of capitalism.  The only place in East Berlin I could find to spend my East German Deutschmarks was a little ice-cream parlor that doled out cold war-sized wafer cones of strict ice milk in an assortment that was pedestrian at best.  Even with my Middle American appetite, I can't down 25 East German Deutschmarks worth of Gorbachev-era ice-milk, and on that day, with all the excitement of chipping away at the wall and meeting Checkpoint Charlie MP's from Port Washington, WI, I only managed to get rid of about 4 of East German Deutschmarks.  So now, somewhere in my vast collection of crap, probably in a bag next to the pieces of the wall that I chipped off using a hammer I stole from a little kid from Baden-Baden, I have 21 rather austere looking, completely obsolete East German Deutschmarks.\n\nOk, yeah, so Walzwerk...\n35 stars for the spinach salmon spaetzle!  Sadly, I'll have to dock them 22 stars for not having it on the menu every day.

Ok, where does that leave us...7 stars?  That sounds about right.\n\nI love this place.  As you've probably gathered, I love the Spaetzle, with or without salmon and spinach.

I'd never had German food before coming to Walzwerk, so I really had no idea what to expect before walking in.

But even if you're just walking in, the line won't be too long if you're there on a weekday.\n\nService is great. All the servers are super friendly, patient, and helpful, which is great because the menu has some pretty foreign terms. Wait was somewhat long (15-20min to get our main courses), but our server checked up on us during that time to make sure we had enough water/drinks/etc. Location is pretty sketchy, but if you are with someone else, it shouldn't be a problem walking around.\n\nThe food itself is definitely unique but very, very good. My friend and I shared an appetizer and an entree. The matjes herring (basically a potato salad-esque dish with fish instead of potatoes) appetizer was the most interesting of the night. I still can't tell if I liked it or not, but it did present me with such a unique flavor composition that I have never experienced before. I'd say that the flavors of the sauce are really similar to your typical potato salad. The texture of the fish, however, was the most unfamiliar to me. Upon first bite, my friend and I both didn't know if we had actually eaten the fish or if it was something else. We had to try a few more pieces before confirming that it was indeed the fish. Chewy, cold, and didn't remind me of fish meat at all. Not my favorite dish of the night, but still worth a try if you're want to experience new flavors.\n\nI absolutely adored the entree that we ordered - the vegetarische krautroulade, stuffed cabbage with lentils, root veggies, and lots of other good stuff, smothered in a fragrant tomato sauce.

I've never had tomato soup that included a slice of lemon. But it really melded the flavors together. \n\nFor an entree, I had rinderroulade (tri-tip stuffed with bacon, pickles and mustard, sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage). The meat was tinder and served in a red gravy. The sp\u00e4tzle was a perfect side, more interesting and flavorful than potatoes. And the cabbage provided just enough vinegary pizzazz to keep the dish interesting. \n\nThe rote gr\u00fctze (red berry pudding - raspberries, strawberries & blueberries made with cream of wheat and vanilla sauce) was a fitting finale. The berry flavor was strong and refreshing. \n\nThe woman with the German accent who was serving us was very helpful and accommodating. She was obviously very proud of the food, and rightfully so. This is definitely a place I will go back to.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-01-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Hey they have Rote Gr\u00fctze and Bionade.\n\n\n"], "author": "Dennis G.", "review": "Having grown up in Berlin and having just recently moved back (A friend of mine thought it would be funny to take me me to a German restaurant a day after i came back to SF) I have been to Suppenk\u00fcche and wasn't thoroughly impressed, so I was keen to check out Walzwerk. Automatic Stars for having a pic of Erich Honecker, nothing like some DDR nostaligia! Beerwise, proper half liters like one would get in Germany, and the food was pretty good. I wish they had more Junge Pioniere (Seid bereit!) deco to really encapsulate the experience. Maybe they did, and i just did not notice cause of marathon drinking the night before and minor jetlag.
