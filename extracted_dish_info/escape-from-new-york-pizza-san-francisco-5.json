Escape tops their pies generously, uses hella fresh ingredients, is quick, and the delivery crew is outstandingly nice. The Liberty salad is simple and amazingly good as well. Since I moved to the Mission, this is the only place I trust for damn good pizza. I can't think of any other place that uses chicken so damn...well it ain't the bagged kind, I guarantee that.
