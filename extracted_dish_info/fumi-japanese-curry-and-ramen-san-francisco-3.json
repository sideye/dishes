It just feels more authentic to me that way like I'm living in a Yasujiro Ozu family drama where over a low-lying dinner table on a tatami, I'm scolded for not finding a proper wife at my advanced age. I was hoping there would be a bit of that feeling at Fumi since I considered it a good sign that it shares the name of my Okasan. Yep, my mom's name was Fumiye.

I felt it was essential I order the $10 Pork Katsu, even though it looked identical to all their curry plates in the photo menu. It was presented on a strangely immaculate plate where the katsu slices were fanned out decoratively on a small mound of rice sitting in a pool of watery curry sauce. On the side was a tuft of mixed greens with a dribble of corn kernels (photo: http://bit.ly/1i4o2r7). A food stylist's work of art but...\n\nThe pork was a bit dry and flavorless. It looked like it was pounded into submission to make it look symmetrical, and the coating lacked the crunch that would have excited me to no end. I was bummed because my \"Tokyo Story\" fantasy of a home-cooked meal went poof. I was also disappointed that a $2.50 Diet Coke amounted to one of those Lilliputian aluminum bottles because I usually finish those in ten seconds flat. The surprising highlight of the meal turned out to be my side dish, the $5 Garlic Broccoli because it was fresh and crispy with the chopped garlic providing just the right seasoning (photo: http://bit.ly/1U8eI6C).

I like to fantasize about the day I can buy a house in the city where I was born and raised in for oh you know, a million or two. I figure if Mr. NSS and I both sell our kidneys in the black market, we would have just enough for one quarter of a house at Bernal Heights, the \"hottest neighborhood of 2014\".\n\nTell that to Andrew from MDLSF and he'll probably shudder. Can that guy be any more of a douche?\n\nTeam Roh! \n\nOk, some parts of Bernal Heights isn't exactly the nicest and the some of the streets are as tight as a virgin's whoohaaa but the neighborhood is cute and most people are very friendly. Plus, you can't beat the breathtaking, panoramic from Bernal Hill. One area that Bernal Heights is lacking in is solid Asian restaurants. Ichi doesn't count unless you have a daily food allowance of $80+.\n\nOpening a week and a half ago, Fumi Japanese Curry & Seafood took over the old Eagle Donuts space, next to Pizza Hacker. The space is tiny with seating for 20 and three counter seats. This is not a place for groups larger than 4 but they do take reservations for 6 or more people. \n\nOn the menu are Apps (popcorn shrimp, karaage, gyoza, spring rolls), Salads (Asian crab and ceasar), Soups (kabocha, miso, clam), Curry Rice, Curry Noodles, Teriyaki, Teppan Curry, and Whole Crab. Except for the crab and seafood dishes, everything is less than $12. Portions are filling for the price. They also have kid meals for $6-$7. Vegetarian and brown rice options available. No booze available. \n\nWe started with the Chicken Karaage ($8) which I would pass on: http://bit.ly/1Jfygip. The garlic and ginger flavor was there but I wasn't keen on the batter they used. Instead of using the traditional potato starch coating that produces a deliciously crunchy crust, the [wet] batter was doughy and on the softer side. \n\nThe Pork Katsu Curry Rice ($10) was surprisingly very solid...for Bernal Heights: http://bit.ly/1EAgyR6. The curry sauce is housemade and contains no msg.  I ordered it extra spicy, and it seems like they hiked up the spice levels per earlier Yelp reviews. The curry was nicely thick and fiery with a subtle sweetness. The spices could have been more developed but it was satisfying nonetheless. The katsu was perfectly fried. It was golden, crunchy, and very tender. Just as important was the rice to soak up all that curry, it had just the right amount of stickiness. I added an egg (+$2) which was overcooked. Next time, I would request it sunny side up for some egg yolk porn. Make sure to enjoy your curry with the fukujinzuke pickles that are hidden in a metal container next to the salt and pepper shakers.  \n\nAgainst my recommendation of sticking with the curry dishes, Mr. NSS ordered the Beef Teriyaki ($11): http://bit.ly/1MwhxIJ. He said it was kinda chewy but alright. I had a piece and it needed more of a sear at a higher temperature and more sauce. \n\nTo cool down the heat, we ordered the Mochi Ice Cream ($3 each) for dessert: http://bit.ly/1KtSFNf. It's just sliced and plated Mikawaya Mochi Ice Cream which I saw them pull from the freezer. The batch they got was old as the mochi was hard, and didn't have that chewy, toothsome chew. \n\nService was typical Asian service. Staff was cordial and timely when we asked for things though. We were the only ones there during dinner which was kinda awkward. I think if they offered delivery via Eat24, it may drive more business. I know I would order regularly if they did offer delivery. \n\nGood luck with parking.

I like to fantasize about the day I can buy a house in the city where I was born and raised in for oh you know, a million or two. I figure if Mr. NSS and I both sell our kidneys in the black market, we would have just enough for one quarter of a house at Bernal Heights, the \"hottest neighborhood of 2014\".\n\nTell that to Andrew from MDLSF and he'll probably shudder. Can that guy be any more of a douche?\n\nTeam Roh! \n\nOk, some parts of Bernal Heights isn't exactly the nicest and the some of the streets are as tight as a virgin's whoohaaa but the neighborhood is cute and most people are very friendly. Plus, you can't beat the breathtaking, panoramic from Bernal Hill. One area that Bernal Heights is lacking in is solid Asian restaurants. Ichi doesn't count unless you have a daily food allowance of $80+.\n\nOpening a week and a half ago, Fumi Japanese Curry & Seafood took over the old Eagle Donuts space, next to Pizza Hacker. The space is tiny with seating for 20 and three counter seats. This is not a place for groups larger than 4 but they do take reservations for 6 or more people. \n\nOn the menu are Apps (popcorn shrimp, karaage, gyoza, spring rolls), Salads (Asian crab and ceasar), Soups (kabocha, miso, clam), Curry Rice, Curry Noodles, Teriyaki, Teppan Curry, and Whole Crab. Except for the crab and seafood dishes, everything is less than $12. Portions are filling for the price. They also have kid meals for $6-$7. Vegetarian and brown rice options available. No booze available. \n\nWe started with the Chicken Karaage ($8) which I would pass on: http://bit.ly/1Jfygip. The garlic and ginger flavor was there but I wasn't keen on the batter they used. Instead of using the traditional potato starch coating that produces a deliciously crunchy crust, the [wet] batter was doughy and on the softer side. \n\nThe Pork Katsu Curry Rice ($10) was surprisingly very solid...for Bernal Heights: http://bit.ly/1EAgyR6. The curry sauce is housemade and contains no msg.  I ordered it extra spicy, and it seems like they hiked up the spice levels per earlier Yelp reviews. The curry was nicely thick and fiery with a subtle sweetness. The spices could have been more developed but it was satisfying nonetheless. The katsu was perfectly fried. It was golden, crunchy, and very tender. Just as important was the rice to soak up all that curry, it had just the right amount of stickiness. I added an egg (+$2) which was overcooked. Next time, I would request it sunny side up for some egg yolk porn. Make sure to enjoy your curry with the fukujinzuke pickles that are hidden in a metal container next to the salt and pepper shakers.  \n\nAgainst my recommendation of sticking with the curry dishes, Mr. NSS ordered the Beef Teriyaki ($11): http://bit.ly/1MwhxIJ. He said it was kinda chewy but alright. I had a piece and it needed more of a sear at a higher temperature and more sauce. \n\nTo cool down the heat, we ordered the Mochi Ice Cream ($3 each) for dessert: http://bit.ly/1KtSFNf. It's just sliced and plated Mikawaya Mochi Ice Cream which I saw them pull from the freezer. The batch they got was old as the mochi was hard, and didn't have that chewy, toothsome chew. \n\nService was typical Asian service. Staff was cordial and timely when we asked for things though. We were the only ones there during dinner which was kinda awkward. I think if they offered delivery via Eat24, it may drive more business. I know I would order regularly if they did offer delivery. \n\nGood luck with parking.

An equally impressive aspect was the heavenly interplay of textures. Not only was the rice perfectly charred like the bottom of clay pot rice or dolsot bibimbap; the egg was crisped as well. Together with the katsu featuring a crunchy panko exterior and juicy meaty interior, this was a very satisfying dish. The pictures of the curry rice plates do look a bit small, as other reviewers have pointed out, so I would recommend sticking to the more avant-garde teppan curry. \n\nThe ramen turned out to be just alright; it will do to satisfy ramen cravings but I do prefer Coco's in Bernal for the wow factor. The broth was attenuated in tonkotsu flavor, mildly creamy, and less salty (to our liking). The portion size was just sufficient, conveniently leaving space for dessert at Mitchell's afterwards P: Although it came with the basics of half an egg, 3 chashu slices, menma, kikurage, corn, and spinach, it could definitely use a larger quantity of each topping. My favorite part of my ramen was the soft-boiled egg, which was on point with its mastery of the liquid gold yolk. They also have more unique ramen options, such as the California ramen with avocado and soft shell crab ramen (The boo was interested in this, but I thought the soft shell crab looked creepy like it was about to walk out of the ramen bowl any moment.)\n\nDinner totaled to $24 pre-tip, very affordable for quality noms in SF. They also have happy hour 5-7pm with BOGO dranks but unfortunately we didn't notice until we left and saw the poster outside (and they have Asahi black!!). The ambiance is nice and relaxing, with traditional Japanese decor that is homey but not flashy and abstract like many Japanese places these days. (Plus, nothing can beat an ambiance of Totoro music in the background) Service is efficient and attentive, and the owner is very friendly. Hurray for small businesses--even though Fumi is newer to the neighborhood, it feels very personable and non-gentrification-y while adding delicious traditional Japanese curry to the SF food scene.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-14"}, {"excerpts": ["the Pork Katsu Teppan Curry & I tried the Soft Shell Crab Ramen.

Came here around 7 and the place wasn't packed but it had people inside. It's pretty small inside, fits about 20ish people I want to say. The remodel wasn't bad, compared to what it used to look like. Anyway, onto the food.\n\nShared the chicken karage. The karage wasn't bad, was actually probably my favorite dish of the meal. Hot, moist, and flavorful... yum. Shared the pork katsu curry over rice, medium spicy. The curry wasn't flavorful, but it wasn't completely bland. It needed more curry to flavor everything, especially since you're eating it with rice. If you eat it with the rice, you lose the curry flavor. The pork katsu wasn't bad, crispy and was pretty flavorful. We also got the beef curry over noodles. The curry sauce was pretty bland with the noodles. It was pretty bland when I just slurped the curry sauce too. Some of the beef pieces were tender while others were chewy... I'm not sure how that happened. Both the spiciness levels need to be worked on too... there was no kick to it either. We even ordered a very spicy curry over rice for someone to go and they said the very spicy wasn't even spicy!

Not quite, but very close and close enough to nail four stars.\n\nOf course I had the curry. They have two vegetarian curries in addition to several with meat,  fish, or seafood. I ordered spicy, which I expected to be medium given the choices of mild, spicy, and extra spicy, and it was, about similar to Muracci's medium. The \"every green\" has tofu, carrots and broccoli. The default is fried tofu. I asked for un-fried and that's what they did and it was good. Nice they have a brown rice option, too. I'll be back to try the vegan chicken (gobo root). And curious about the curry noodles as well. Anyway, the curry sauce was good enough that I soaked up the generous portion with the remaining rice.\n\nThe one fish item was deep fried. It would be nice if they had a grilled option for the curry, though it looks like they have that in the teriyaki version. I'll ask next time.\n\nAlso got a side of steamed veggies, which was mostly broccoli and pleasantly al dente.\n\nThe print on the menu is small, so if you need reading glasses, bring 'em along.

(It was probably over half an hour, but it was after 8 soooo.) \n\nMy date gets the same meal each time he goes to Fumi: seafood with black curry omurice (Japanese omelette with curry and fried rice inside.)

I think it should be included! \n\nThey have a pretty good dessert menu including green tea cheesecake, mango mousse, tiramisu, Mochi, and regular ice cream. \n\nIf you're in the Mission, check out Fumi for top-notch ramen and curry plates!", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-09-14"}], "every green teppan curry ramen": []}
