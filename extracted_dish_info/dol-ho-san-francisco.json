There wasn't much of a line and I felt like I was at a bar trying to order a drink. Chaos I tell you!\n\nA bunch of older ladies cut in front of me, but the one lady who was running the show knew I was there first and saw I was lost and asked if it was to go or for here. \n\nShe sat us down because we were going to eat there and we were promptly given a menu after she told the waitress we were eating there. I wanted to try an array of dishes. Prices were so good!\n\nturnip cake\nDefinitely not what I expected. Texture was that of gelatin, more than a cake. Nice sear on the outside but it was room temp. Maybe because we got there 30 min before closing.\n\nshrimp dumpling\nTaste fishy, and not fresh\n\ncrepe with cilantro\nIt wasn't what I thought it was. I was expecting a flour egg crepe but it was a rice noodle with soy sauce dressing. It was actually pretty good but the noodle was a little over done\n\nBBQ pork pastry and bun \nDefinitely liked the bun better than the pastry. Maybe because the bun was nice and warm\n\nwell reviewed pork over rice\nI was very disappointed in the one. The pork wasn't tender. It wasn't cooked long enough. The cartilage was still hard.  The sauce was thick and mushy. There was one rib that I ate that tasted rotten. As if the pork that was cooked wasn't fresh. Then while my bf tried one while he was poking around, there was a purple dot thing on one of the ribs. Maybe the pork wasn't fresh? I've never seen anything like it. I didn't have time to take a photo of it because I was turned off by it and the rotten rib I had tried.\n\nI guess this is the type of fast food locals like to eat. I did come because of all the rave reviews. But I didn't feel like there was cook for quality. More for cook for the mass. \n\nThey also aren't very keen on keeping the place tidy. We asked to get the chili sauce wiped off the table, and she just came to use a napkin to smear it around the whole table. \n\nThe bowl the rib and rice came in was sticky on the outside like it hadn't been washed.....this place is very sketchy.....\n\nIt is a local place, it is cheap, and I don't mind giving those small shops a try.

No one is there to seat you, you basically wait until seats open up. A gentlemen behind me pointed us in the direction of two empty seats. We shared a table someone else, it seemed to be that many people shared a table. \n\nThere were no menus just a woman who would bring out a cart with different food selections. Because the tables were so close she would make her way through and would ask what we wanted from the cart. Once she gave us the food she would make a tally mark on our order sheet that was left on our table. The gentlemen we shared the table\nWith was very kind, he must have told one of the waitresses that we wanted water because she cane back with two glasses and a water pot!

I'm all for changing the motto.  First thing--we scour and spy on neighboring tables to see what's thee dish to get- turns out it tin can with spareribs over rice.  Well then we have to get that.  Such a simple dish and it was satiating.  it has the perfect balance of flavor with tender ribs.  Since we sat right by the kitchen opening I got to ooooo and aaahhh at the dishes being made.  The one dish constantly churning out were the ribs over rice.   Most of the dim sum dishes are requested since there is one cart lady catering to all the tables.  You better know the dishes you want.  Every dish was perfectly seasoned- turnip cake, shrimp dumpling, rice roll, steamed pork bun and rice crepe.  I can't remember a bad dish and believe me there usually is one at most spots.  \n\nI'm so happy they open at 8 in the morning.  I will definitely be coming back for more of that rib over rice.

I think it's the top segment of the chicken leg, wrapped and cooked in foil.  It's got awesome flavor throughout the whole chicken and super tasty!  I'm so glad I got it even though she couldn't tell me what was inside.  \n\nHad pork spareribs, their most famous dish.  Most of the older Chinese crowd gets it over rice, we just got it standalone and it was delicious!  A little fattier than what I'm used to, it has great flavor with the black beans.  Also ordered the beef meatballs and they were delicious as well with chopped up water chestnuts inside.  Fried stuffed tofu triangles were delicious as well, just wish they were hot when we got them.  \n\nLove their homemade chili sauce, not very spicy but it's different than anywhere else I've ever been to.  They used dried daikon (white radish), black bean and chili flake to make it.. not sure if there's a little garlic in it too.  Yummy!\n\nFor all 5 dishes with oolong tea came out to $16 after tax.  I don't think the waitress there gets tipped because when I handed her $2 she quickly grabbed it, smile and nod at me, and shoved the money in her apron as if that was the first tip she's got all day or that she didn't want others to see.  I know older Chinese people don't usually tip and that's the majority of the customers there.  \n\nI would recommend if you tip, give it to the person that took care of you directly and not just leave it up at the front counter when you pay.  The lady behind the counter is not the nicest person and people have a tendency to cut in front of you.  If you give the tip to the lady upfront she will take it and not sure if she even distributes it to other workers.  Waiting in line is not really the best qualities of Chinese people and it shows at this restaurant.  \n\nOverall, knowing what I was getting myself into, this place is awesome.

Great portion sizes for two to share (about 2 pretty big pieces each), very fresh and tasty and unbeatable prices (2,50$-3,50$ per plate to share!). \n\nAfter a few minutes wondering how we were gonna order specific dishes we had seen on the menu, we asked for BBQ Pork Bun that happened to be on the tray and got it immediately. Best bun ever!! (see picture). We then decided to try the ribs over rice which were okay (lots of bones and very tiny pieces). We finished with huge fried shrimp dumplings. Very particular but I liked it! \n\nWe were very full coming out of there and the prices were so cheap: 17$ for all of that and free tea served right when we got there.

Grab a seat, pour out your dipping sauces, and ask for a menu. \n\nThe food is not particularly fast, but it all came within a reasonable time. Plenty of interesting people watching in the meantime. This place is frequented mainly by Chinatown locals and regulars, most of whom are old and ain't got time for any nonsense. You will hear Chinese spoken throughout the room. Once you order, you will get a pot of hot tea which will be your best friend as you slurp down delicious dim sum dumplings and buns.\n\nMost menu items are well prepared, delicious and very simply flavored -- nothing over complicated, experimental, frou frou, or designer farm-to-table here. A few faves: the deep fried shrimp balls, steamed pork buns (very abundant with tasty, flavorful filling), shrimp and chive dumplings, chicken nests (a chunk of chicken wrapped in a nest of clear cellophane noodles). We're talking solid, old school, traditional dim sum. And if frugality is an Olympic sport for you, you will be scoring gold medals here. It just doesn't get any cheaper than this for really solid dim sum. Period.\n\nMake sure to bring cash, use a bathroom before you head over, and prepare to stuff your bellies.\n\n*PARENT ADVICE* Doesn't seem like they had any highchairs for little ones.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["We finished with huge fried shrimp dumplings.

We walked in thinking we were gonna get our order taken and be served like in a normal restaurant, right? Wrong! \n\nA lady appears, coming around with hot trays on a cart and offering different dishes you can accept to have or not. We were lucky as the two first dishes we would have ordered anyway: pork and shrimp dumplings. Great portion sizes for two to share (about 2 pretty big pieces each), very fresh and tasty and unbeatable prices (2,50$-3,50$ per plate to share!). \n\nAfter a few minutes wondering how we were gonna order specific dishes we had seen on the menu, we asked for BBQ Pork Bun that happened to be on the tray and got it immediately. Best bun ever!! (see picture). We then decided to try the ribs over rice which were okay (lots of bones and very tiny pieces). We finished with huge fried shrimp dumplings. Very particular but I liked it! \n\nWe were very full coming out of there and the prices were so cheap: 17$ for all of that and free tea served right when we got there.

It's very unassuming and no frills. There is a counter at the front which you can order to-go items from, which seemed to be pretty popular. The place was packed with elders reading the newspaper, some solo and other catching up with old friends. It has a homey feel.\n\nYou can pretty much seat yourself, but since the place was packed and we hadn't been there before, the server cleared out a spot for us. The tables are all kinda joined together, so you'll probably be sitting next to others. This doesn't seem to be a place to linger. The tables turn over quickly. Plenty of people just come in for one dish, read the paper, drink some tea, and leave. However, service was friendly and we did not feel rushed.\n\nThey were quick to give us tea, and our chopsticks and plates, so we were ready to go. There was only one woman with a cart, but she was regularly coming out with fresh new items. You can easily see into the open kitchen, so you can see them preparing all the new dishes to bring out. \n\nEven though the two us ordered at least two more dishes after we were already stuffed (and took home our leftovers: 2 large fried shrimp dumplings, 2 turnips cakes, and 2 pieces of beef crepe), we left so stuffed and it all cost less than $20 total. This place is cheap! \n\nSomeone helpfully posted pictures of the menu on here, which was nowhere to be seen in the restaurant, so although, they don't serve a huge variety of dishes, I still thought this place was solid. It's super cheap, service is quick, and the dishes were good. There were no super-amazing dishes that were memorable, but everything was solid. \n\nAs everyone mentions, the Rib Rice was a good dish that I'm glad we ordered.
