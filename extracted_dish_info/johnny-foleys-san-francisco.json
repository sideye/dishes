The Irish coffees were good and not too sweet. (I asked our server to make mine less sweet.) I love soup, so I enjoyed the seafood chowder. It was creamy, had a good amount of seafood, and not too rich as I tend to like a lighter broth. I tasted the rest of the dishes and thought they were pretty good.
