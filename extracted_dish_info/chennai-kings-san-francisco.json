For our meal, we got the butter chicken and chicken shahi kurma with rice and bread. \n\nAt first, we were unsure of how the bread would be since it's not naan; however, it is BETTER. Way better! Finally, we topped it off with Rose milk and coffee - both were phenomenal. \n\nOverall, I give this restaurant a five star review. The food, ambience, location, and service were all around wonderful!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-11-16"}], "butter milk": [{"excerpts": ["The butter milk drink was one of the best I've ever had.

So glad a new South Indian restaurant opened in the city. \nExtensive menu of many delicious sounding things to try for carnivores and vegetarians alike. We ended up sharing a vegetarian biriyani and a madras masala dosa. Both were exceptionally good! The biriyani was very spicy (we ordered regular) so if you aren't used to extremely spicy food I recommend not getting the hotter version. Aside from the heat level, the spices they used were delicious!\nWe also really enjoyed our dosa and accompanying chutneys. \nThe butter milk drink was one of the best I've ever had. Think lassi without sugar and spices added. Soooo good! \nI look forward to trying more dishes here next time.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-06-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I had wonderful kothu parotta, kal Dosa,  Biriyani, BUTTER milk.

People should definitely try the garlic chicken which was spicy and lip smacking good which  reminded me of home. \nIf you like trying different dishes , you must have a taste of the dosas they have.

Uff my mouth is watering just typing it all out!! \n\nDefinitely a place I would visit frequently now .. The service was top class, the young waitress had an amazing smile and was courteous The staff is very friendly and the manager can help u out if it's ur first time at the restaurant. \n\nI hope more people visit this place and get to taste the South Indian cuisine of India.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-05-29"}], "sweet lassi": [], "masala tea": [{"excerpts": ["It took a while to get my masala tea out ", "but it was fine.
