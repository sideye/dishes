We had another pleasant experience of good service and great food. We ordered the #308 Rice Noodle Roll, #13 Combination Beef Noodle Soup, #18 Spicy Beef and Pork Rice Noodle Soup (Bun Bo Hue), and the #47 Beef Stew Rice Plate. The soup for the noodle soups were both cooked to perfection. The Beef Stew sauce was also flavorful and the beef was braised to a good chewy texture.  The Rice Noodle Roll was my absolute favorite of today's meal because it was not only unique but also masterfully made, and of course, tasty. \n\nWe forgot to try the Vietnamese sandwiches again so we are definitely coming back soon!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-06-04"}], "vegetarian vietnamese panfried crepe": [], "vegetarian fried imperial rolls": [], "vegetarian fried imperial rolls cold vermicelli": [], "vegetable chow mein noodle": [], "mixed vegetable noodle soup": [], "vietnamese style tofu hot and sour soup": [], "sauteed mixed vegetables with garlic": [], "szechuan tofu": [], "curry tofu rice plate": [], "sauteed clear noodle with mushroom and fried tofu": [], "side house special chicken": [], "beef brisket": [], "rare beef": [{"excerpts": ["HOUSE SPECIAL BEEF NOODLE SOUP- rare beef, beef tripe, tendon, and beef ball\n", "The broth was on the bland side and the noodles didn't take on the broth flavor.
