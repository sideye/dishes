They also give you a free miso soup.  the chicken karaage, and the kappa roll and a little bit of sake are the foods I ordered, but the drink I prefer is the lychee ice tea. The food portions were a little bit small. The bathroom was clean and decent but small. This restaurant was very clean and big.  There is a place that you can see them making food.\n\n*submitted by me and my nine year old nephew", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-12-29"}], "green creme brulee": [], "chocolate lava cake and green tea ice cream": [], "fried vanilla ball": [], "yuzu lemonade": []}
