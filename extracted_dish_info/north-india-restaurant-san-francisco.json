The food came out fairly quickly after we finished our appetizer, and I appreciated that they took care to space the two courses. The presentation of the food was appetizing as well, and each dish had a sprinkle of garnish on top. The navratan korma had a pleasing gravy, with slivered nuts and an assortment of veggies. The creaminess was just right. We asked for medium spicy, but in the future I would probably request the dish to be hotter, as the gravy was still fairly mild.  While the lamb jalfrezi had a delicious sauce (similar to rogan gosht), the meat was served a bit too chewy for my taste. The dal was flavored with generous amounts of ginger, onions, and garlic, and was our favorite of the dishes that we ordered.\n\nThroughout the meal, the service was very attentive, so much so that I must have drank ten glasses of water! The server also checked on us to inquire how we were enjoying our meal and to ask if we needed any other items. When we were ready to leave, they brought us the check along with three (free) gulab jamun. So tasty!

The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript.

North India Restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, so we were seated by the window. The interior of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Bhangra music played lightly in the background and the booths along the window had soft, comfortable cushions.

The chicken tikka masala was rich, creamy, and sufficiently spicy (we specified that spice level to be 'hot'), everything that one would want in this dish.

Our waiter took our orders quickly (and didn't need to write them down), and our food was brought out to us promptly. \n\nAmazingly, with the Yelp deal our meal cost just over $30.

I ordered some mix vegetable Jalfrezi with side of diced green chilies, forget getting the order right and caring about the customers special request, they literally made the curry taste like it was frozen vegetables boiled in hot water and topped it off with some red chili sauce. Curry had \"0\" flavor whatsoever, no masala or anything whatsoever. I have never tried such blad type of curry in my entire stay in Bay Area. This by far has been the worst food that I have ordered and so was the customer \"online order,\" I don't get how you can mess up online order that's in clear english writing in front of you. If it was placed over the phone or in person and someone couldn't speak clearly, I would have understood if the order was wrong but come on this is an online order. Also, their \"nan\" are actually thick \"roti,\" not truly naan so don't get fooled with those breads with your order.\n\nI wish there was a way to rate less than 1 but since yelp only allows 1 being minimum than that's what they get from me.", "rating": 1, "date": "2017-04-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Great food, had the Mushroom Mattar, Vegetable Jalfrezi, Paratha, Dal soup, jasmine rice and Spinach Paratha with Lagunitas IPA!

We hadn't had Indian food in a while, so we decided to try out North India Restaurant.\n\nWhile Market Street was teeming with throngs of holiday shoppers, the area a couple blocks east was much quieter. North India Restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, so we were seated by the window. The interior of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Bhangra music played lightly in the background and the booths along the window had soft, comfortable cushions. It was a nice respite from the clamor of Market Street.\n\nI suppose that this restaurant gets most of its customers at lunch time when it has a buffet. In the evenings, they offer an amazing Yelp deal for half off of a second entree. We were happy to take them up on this offer, and we ordered chicken tikka masala, Bombay chicken, and vegetable pakora as an appetizer. \n\nThe pakora was crisp and had a hint of spice to it. The cilantro mint chutney complemented the pakora well, and my girlfriend appreciated that they put the tamarind in a separate ramekin from the cilantro chutney (she is not a fan of the tamarind). \n\nShortly after we finished our appetizer, our main dishes arrived. The chicken tikka masala was rich, creamy, and sufficiently spicy (we specified that spice level to be 'hot'), everything that one would want in this dish. The sauce for the Bombay chicken was very similar to the tikka masala sauce but without the heavy cream. The piquant sauces tasted great with the crisp, buttery naan. The chicken was tender and juicy as well. \n\nOn top of the food being excellent, the service was really great too. What some people in other reviews may call \"rudeness\" was really just alacrity. Our waiter took our orders quickly (and didn't need to write them down), and our food was brought out to us promptly. \n\nAmazingly, with the Yelp deal our meal cost just over $30.

If you have a lot of time.. like a lot of time.. and don't want to engage in conversation with the wait staff, give this place a try. \n\nI was led to this place after doing some yelp search and was super disappointed. \n\nAmbiance: Not bad. Dimly lit, one long stem rose and small candle on the table, cushions for the wall seating. As soon as you walk it, you get hit with the smell of fish..... o_o I don't like fishy smell but hey, maybe you do. \n\nCleanliness: Didn't feel too gross but I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place I've dined at. \n\nFood:  \n\nVeggie samoas - 2 for $4.95. They're a little smaller than tennis balls. You can  taste the different spices but it wasn't freshly made. I could definitely tell they were pre-made a while ago - the fried-ness wasn't fresh. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - not bad but very creamy. Got it with mild spiciness but didn't have a hint of spiciness. \n\nChicken Vindaloo - Description said it was spicy but wasn't spicy at all. This was ok but I preferred the tikka masala. \n\nGarlic Naan: Got two large pieces - put them together and you have a sheet of standard printer paper. Both were smothered with butter and cilantro. Kinda tasted like they've been out for a while too. \n\nPualo - basmati rice with peas. Maybe 5 peas? I'm pretty sure the peas are there to add some color. Rice was out for a while - I eat and cook rice quite often and know what old rice tastes like. Rice was kinda hard bc it was a bit dry. Ew. \n\nCustomer service - SUCKED. Made the entire dining experience HORRIBLE. Walked in and no one acknowledges us. Restaurant is maybe 35% full so not sure what the delay was. Stood around for about 5mins and the worker who delivered the food sat us down at a corner table. Sat down, looked at the menu, hung out for 10 minutes... and the water boy came to fill our water cups. Drank some water, sat some more, stared into space, thought about pizza, people watched through the window as the workers just walked right by.. Mind you, there was one table next to us but they had already gotten the check so in our area, we're really the only 'active' customer. Finally asked the water boy if he can take our order. He pointed to a man wearing all white. The man wearing all white came and took our order. No hello, no greeting, no smile.. fine, maybe he's having a bad day. Veggie samoas came out in literally a minute. I was surprised but go figure- they were pre-made. Tikka masala, vindaloo, rice, and naan came out in 5 mins. One plus is the food comes out really fast. I'm used to my waiter coming around and asking how everything is. Didn't get that from the man dressed in white but whatever. Fortunately, everything was fine. Towards the end of our meal, another couple was sat right next to us. The man dressed in white came right away, greeted them with smile, made small talk. Their food also came out fast and though we ordered the same rice, theirs were double the size of ours. The man dressed in white even asked them how everything was as soon as their food came out. What's up with that? Anyways, finished eating and again, waiting around. No one came around so my friend and I tried to figure out the organizational structure of the staff. Man dress in white is clearly someone in charge. He's the only one that really 'interacts' with the customers. There is one guy who always delivers the food from the kitchen. There's another guy who is in charge of filling the water cups. Let me tell you - this guy takes his job VERY seriously. I take a sip and he's right there waiting to fill my cup. There's another guy who is mainly responsible for cleaning the tables and setting them up. They're all very hard workers. Unfortunately, the laziest one is the one who interacts with the customers. After figuring out all of this, we waived down the water boy to get the check. The man dressed in white came and I flashed my coupon from yelp (check-in and you get 50% off a second entree after 3pm).

We hadn't had Indian food in a while, so we decided to try out North India Restaurant.\n\nWhile Market Street was teeming with throngs of holiday shoppers, the area a couple blocks east was much quieter. North India Restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, so we were seated by the window. The interior of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Bhangra music played lightly in the background and the booths along the window had soft, comfortable cushions. It was a nice respite from the clamor of Market Street.\n\nI suppose that this restaurant gets most of its customers at lunch time when it has a buffet. In the evenings, they offer an amazing Yelp deal for half off of a second entree. We were happy to take them up on this offer, and we ordered chicken tikka masala, Bombay chicken, and vegetable pakora as an appetizer. \n\nThe pakora was crisp and had a hint of spice to it. The cilantro mint chutney complemented the pakora well, and my girlfriend appreciated that they put the tamarind in a separate ramekin from the cilantro chutney (she is not a fan of the tamarind). \n\nShortly after we finished our appetizer, our main dishes arrived. The chicken tikka masala was rich, creamy, and sufficiently spicy (we specified that spice level to be 'hot'), everything that one would want in this dish. The sauce for the Bombay chicken was very similar to the tikka masala sauce but without the heavy cream. The piquant sauces tasted great with the crisp, buttery naan. The chicken was tender and juicy as well. \n\nOn top of the food being excellent, the service was really great too. What some people in other reviews may call \"rudeness\" was really just alacrity. Our waiter took our orders quickly (and didn't need to write them down), and our food was brought out to us promptly. \n\nAmazingly, with the Yelp deal our meal cost just over $30.

Kinda tasted like they've been out for a while too. \n\nPualo - basmati rice with peas. Maybe 5 peas? I'm pretty sure the peas are there to add some color. Rice was out for a while - I eat and cook rice quite often and know what old rice tastes like. Rice was kinda hard bc it was a bit dry. Ew. \n\nCustomer service - SUCKED. Made the entire dining experience HORRIBLE. Walked in and no one acknowledges us. Restaurant is maybe 35% full so not sure what the delay was. Stood around for about 5mins and the worker who delivered the food sat us down at a corner table. Sat down, looked at the menu, hung out for 10 minutes... and the water boy came to fill our water cups. Drank some water, sat some more, stared into space, thought about pizza, people watched through the window as the workers just walked right by.. Mind you, there was one table next to us but they had already gotten the check so in our area, we're really the only 'active' customer. Finally asked the water boy if he can take our order. He pointed to a man wearing all white. The man wearing all white came and took our order. No hello, no greeting, no smile.. fine, maybe he's having a bad day. Veggie samoas came out in literally a minute. I was surprised but go figure- they were pre-made. Tikka masala, vindaloo, rice, and naan came out in 5 mins. One plus is the food comes out really fast. I'm used to my waiter coming around and asking how everything is. Didn't get that from the man dressed in white but whatever. Fortunately, everything was fine. Towards the end of our meal, another couple was sat right next to us. The man dressed in white came right away, greeted them with smile, made small talk. Their food also came out fast and though we ordered the same rice, theirs were double the size of ours. The man dressed in white even asked them how everything was as soon as their food came out. What's up with that? Anyways, finished eating and again, waiting around. No one came around so my friend and I tried to figure out the organizational structure of the staff. Man dress in white is clearly someone in charge. He's the only one that really 'interacts' with the customers. There is one guy who always delivers the food from the kitchen. There's another guy who is in charge of filling the water cups. Let me tell you - this guy takes his job VERY seriously. I take a sip and he's right there waiting to fill my cup. There's another guy who is mainly responsible for cleaning the tables and setting them up. They're all very hard workers. Unfortunately, the laziest one is the one who interacts with the customers. After figuring out all of this, we waived down the water boy to get the check. The man dressed in white came and I flashed my coupon from yelp (check-in and you get 50% off a second entree after 3pm). H came back with the check and we were thankfully out of there. \n\nI think we spent more time waiting for the staff than eating. Wouldn't ever come here again. Food was alright but oh man, the customer service was non-existent.

Their lunch boxes are very reasonable -- you pay ~$7-9 for 1-2 curries over rice.

Towards its North are the Himalayas which define the boundary between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau. \n\nI've been meaning to drop by this place for lunch for a while now, and finally got the chance to last week.  Let me preface by saying that I certainly felt I was lost in North India after my dine-in experience here.\n\nAfter entering the restaurant, I had to wave down someone to seat us.  Of course, we were seated at a table directly under the sunlight, so I asked if we could be seated at the empty table across from us.  The hostess said it wouldn't be a problem and told us to get our food first.  After shuffling through the buffet line, we ventured to our \"assigned\" table and to my surprise, another hostess had seated another group.\n\nAt that point, we just went to sit wherever there was an open table, and of course, there weren't any utensils so we had to flag down a waiter for forks and knives.  It wasn't until halfway until the meal that someone came by and offered us some water.  After going for seconds, we come back to our table to find that my coworker's forks/knife was taken away.  After asking for another pair, waiter #1 proceeded to cuss out waiter #2 in Punjabi (I think...? or some other native Indian language).  By that time, my coworker and I just blankly stared at each other, totally confused.  It took them another 10 minutes to give us another set of utensils.\n\nFor the actual food, their chicken is extremely tender and the naan is freshly cooked; options are limited for the lunch buffet though but can't complain about the price.

Tara was actually a fairly low-key Thai restaurant that had two dishes I liked and ordered often, the Hainan Chicken and the Prawn Mango Green-Papaya Salad. But that business done gone with the wind. Lawzy, we gots to have a doctor. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies. But I do know standout Bhindi Masala when I have it. Ever been to a hole-in-the-wall called Alhamra? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn, but North India ain't no Alhamra, Miss Scarlett.\n\nJamie W. and I gave it a try after work and had no trouble getting a table since the place was empty except for two other couples between whom we were strategically placed despite the fact that empty tables abound in the large space (photo: http://bit.ly/XZVKUg).

The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript. It was a miss. We asked for the rice with peas, two servings of the Pulao (photo: http://bit.ly/1vb2kSR), which turned out to be too much. I wish the waiter would have offered some opinion on that to steer us in the right direction. The $3.95 Kabuli Naan turned out to be more dessert-like since it was filled with fruit and nuts (photo: http://bit.ly/1sVHJzk). No complaints from me though, I thought it was pretty tasty. It also didn't stop us from ordering dessert since they were the only bargain that evening, $3.50 each. I tried the Kheer, which was a decent handling of traditional rice rice pudding (photo: http://bit.ly/1mqg6Bj), while Jamie had the Coconut Ice Cream which was marred by over-freezing (photo: http://bit.ly/1uBKLe5).

As it's located smack-dab in the Financial District, prices are not cheap but the food is completely worth it. \n\nNorth India's chicken tikka masala is one of the best dishes I've ever had, probably in my entire life (or maybe I just haven't had enough Indian food yet!) It is slightly spicy, buttery, and mouthwatering - managing to achieve that wonderful elusive blend of savory and tanginess, without going overboard. The sauce is not too oily and greasy, and the chicken is juicy and hearty. In addition, the sauce pairs wonderfully with the basmati rice! The garlic naan is incredible, and addicting - a perfect complement to the chicken tikka masala. Portion sizes are massive, and absolutely enough for two meals.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very pleasant, and service is efficient and attentive.

DoorDash had quite a few options for Indian food, but I'm glad my roommate guided me in the right direction for good Indian food, because apparently he's made some mistakes in the past.\n\nTypically, ordering online yields lower quality food than visiting the actual restaurant, so if that's the case here, I really need to visit the physical location of North India Restaurant! I had rogan josh with garlic naan, both of which were phenomenal choices. The flavor was perfect. The order was still hot (thanks to DoorDash) and I had enough leftover food for lunch the next day.\n\nI selected \"medium\" as the spice level for the rogan josh, and I'm sooo glad I wasn't feeling ambitious because \"medium\" was plenty of fire. Both the curry and the naan were a few more dollars than I would usually like to pay for Indian food (especially after all the delivery charges) but it was worth it. They were generously flavorful.\n\nI suppose everything about my experience with North India Restaurant was unusual. I don't usually order food online. I prefer going into the actual restaurant.

We hadn't had Indian food in a while, so we decided to try out North India Restaurant.\n\nWhile Market Street was teeming with throngs of holiday shoppers, the area a couple blocks east was much quieter. North India Restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, so we were seated by the window. The interior of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Bhangra music played lightly in the background and the booths along the window had soft, comfortable cushions. It was a nice respite from the clamor of Market Street.\n\nI suppose that this restaurant gets most of its customers at lunch time when it has a buffet. In the evenings, they offer an amazing Yelp deal for half off of a second entree. We were happy to take them up on this offer, and we ordered chicken tikka masala, Bombay chicken, and vegetable pakora as an appetizer. \n\nThe pakora was crisp and had a hint of spice to it. The cilantro mint chutney complemented the pakora well, and my girlfriend appreciated that they put the tamarind in a separate ramekin from the cilantro chutney (she is not a fan of the tamarind). \n\nShortly after we finished our appetizer, our main dishes arrived. The chicken tikka masala was rich, creamy, and sufficiently spicy (we specified that spice level to be 'hot'), everything that one would want in this dish. The sauce for the Bombay chicken was very similar to the tikka masala sauce but without the heavy cream. The piquant sauces tasted great with the crisp, buttery naan. The chicken was tender and juicy as well. \n\nOn top of the food being excellent, the service was really great too. What some people in other reviews may call \"rudeness\" was really just alacrity. Our waiter took our orders quickly (and didn't need to write them down), and our food was brought out to us promptly. \n\nAmazingly, with the Yelp deal our meal cost just over $30.

They were about 5 other tables already enjoying their lunch.\n\nFrom the buffet, I sampled the following:\n*Palak pakur\n*Fish pakaura\n*Tandoori chicken\n*Malai kofta\n*Rice pilav: saffron flavored basmati rice garnished with green peas\n*Saag paneer\n*Lamb curry: lamb curry with garlic, ginger & onion gravy sauce\n*Chicken makhni: strips of tandoori chicken cooked in a mild creamy sauce\n*Nan\n*Mint Chutney\n\nMy first plate was a tiny sample of each of the above so I could determine what I really wanted to eat. I enjoyed the Fish pakaura, Tandoori chicken, Lamb curry, Chicken makhni, Nan and Mint Chutney so my second plate had a good serving of all of those. The tandoori chicken was moist and the chicken makhni had great flavor. I rarely get lamb curry as the roommate doesn't like lamb, so I enjoyed this. The naan was average, but I always need naan to soak up all the delicious curry!\n\nI actually have an Indian buffet option closer to work, but it's more expensive and and super crowded. You spent half your lunch waiting in line. I was happy North India wasn't really crowded.

I don't mind waiting a bit longer for a quality meal.\n\nSecond problem was when they delivered the meals (to a hotel room, mind you), there were no utensils. This was really annoying and just seemed like a really thoughtless oversight. Luckily we were able to call down to the hotel and they sent up utensils, but it was really an oversight.\n\nFinally, we opened the dishes and realized there was no rice. We ordered a bunch of saucey dishes and thought it must have been a mistake because they typically come with rice. Upon calling the restaurant we were told that we should have ordered the rice separately. This needs to be made much more clear when ordering dishes because they were pretty silly to eat without rice and I didn't end up eating very much.\n\nWith all of that being said, the flavor of my dish was really good (though even the mild version definitely has some heat!). Additionally, the naan was delicious (they have a bunch of flavors).\n\nIt's too bad we didn't eat in the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been a better experience.

Before ordering, I had to send my water glass back  because it was covered in crud and food residue. Not the best first impression.\n\nMy sister placed an order for a sizzling lamb dish (the name I can't recall) and I opted for the lamb curry, extra spicy.

To make matters worse, I was starving at that point and the lamb was cold and dry as can be. \n\nA plus would be that they have a check-in offer.

The paneer dish was just passable (most paneer dishes are). The portion was a little on the small side, and the gravy that constituted much of the dish lacked depth of flavor.

Dimly lit, one long stem rose and small candle on the table, cushions for the wall seating. As soon as you walk it, you get hit with the smell of fish..... o_o I don't like fishy smell but hey, maybe you do. \n\nCleanliness: Didn't feel too gross but I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place I've dined at. \n\nFood:  \n\nVeggie samoas - 2 for $4.95. They're a little smaller than tennis balls. You can  taste the different spices but it wasn't freshly made. I could definitely tell they were pre-made a while ago - the fried-ness wasn't fresh. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - not bad but very creamy. Got it with mild spiciness but didn't have a hint of spiciness. \n\nChicken Vindaloo - Description said it was spicy but wasn't spicy at all. This was ok but I preferred the tikka masala. \n\nGarlic Naan: Got two large pieces - put them together and you have a sheet of standard printer paper. Both were smothered with butter and cilantro. Kinda tasted like they've been out for a while too. \n\nPualo - basmati rice with peas. Maybe 5 peas? I'm pretty sure the peas are there to add some color. Rice was out for a while - I eat and cook rice quite often and know what old rice tastes like. Rice was kinda hard bc it was a bit dry. Ew. \n\nCustomer service - SUCKED. Made the entire dining experience HORRIBLE. Walked in and no one acknowledges us. Restaurant is maybe 35% full so not sure what the delay was. Stood around for about 5mins and the worker who delivered the food sat us down at a corner table. Sat down, looked at the menu, hung out for 10 minutes... and the water boy came to fill our water cups. Drank some water, sat some more, stared into space, thought about pizza, people watched through the window as the workers just walked right by.. Mind you, there was one table next to us but they had already gotten the check so in our area, we're really the only 'active' customer. Finally asked the water boy if he can take our order. He pointed to a man wearing all white. The man wearing all white came and took our order. No hello, no greeting, no smile.. fine, maybe he's having a bad day. Veggie samoas came out in literally a minute. I was surprised but go figure- they were pre-made. Tikka masala, vindaloo, rice, and naan came out in 5 mins. One plus is the food comes out really fast. I'm used to my waiter coming around and asking how everything is. Didn't get that from the man dressed in white but whatever. Fortunately, everything was fine. Towards the end of our meal, another couple was sat right next to us. The man dressed in white came right away, greeted them with smile, made small talk. Their food also came out fast and though we ordered the same rice, theirs were double the size of ours. The man dressed in white even asked them how everything was as soon as their food came out. What's up with that? Anyways, finished eating and again, waiting around. No one came around so my friend and I tried to figure out the organizational structure of the staff. Man dress in white is clearly someone in charge. He's the only one that really 'interacts' with the customers. There is one guy who always delivers the food from the kitchen.

The creaminess was just right. We asked for medium spicy, but in the future I would probably request the dish to be hotter, as the gravy was still fairly mild.  While the lamb jalfrezi had a delicious sauce (similar to rogan gosht), the meat was served a bit too chewy for my taste. The dal was flavored with generous amounts of ginger, onions, and garlic, and was our favorite of the dishes that we ordered.\n\nThroughout the meal, the service was very attentive, so much so that I must have drank ten glasses of water! The server also checked on us to inquire how we were enjoying our meal and to ask if we needed any other items. When we were ready to leave, they brought us the check along with three (free) gulab jamun. So tasty! The gulab jamun were bite-sized, cardamon scented, and served piping hot. \n\nI would definitely return to North Indian restaurant to try out other items and to take in the ambience.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the lamb korma and the paneer makhani with the naan sample basket.

We ordered the paneer makhani, the vegetable jalfrezi, and the chicken tikka masala. I am vegetarian, so I stuck to the paneer and the jalfrezi. The paneer dish was just passable (most paneer dishes are). The portion was a little on the small side, and the gravy that constituted much of the dish lacked depth of flavor. The jalfrezi was truly miserable--it was just a bunch of mixed vegetables that were cut too large and didn't taste very good/fresh. We ordered garlic naan on the side, which was below average. It looked a lot like garlic bread in that the naan was covered in yellow in the center part of the bread slice. \n\nService was decent.

If you have a lot of time.. like a lot of time.. and don't want to engage in conversation with the wait staff, give this place a try. \n\nI was led to this place after doing some yelp search and was super disappointed. \n\nAmbiance: Not bad. Dimly lit, one long stem rose and small candle on the table, cushions for the wall seating. As soon as you walk it, you get hit with the smell of fish..... o_o I don't like fishy smell but hey, maybe you do. \n\nCleanliness: Didn't feel too gross but I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place I've dined at. \n\nFood:  \n\nVeggie samoas - 2 for $4.95. They're a little smaller than tennis balls. You can  taste the different spices but it wasn't freshly made. I could definitely tell they were pre-made a while ago - the fried-ness wasn't fresh. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - not bad but very creamy. Got it with mild spiciness but didn't have a hint of spiciness. \n\nChicken Vindaloo - Description said it was spicy but wasn't spicy at all. This was ok but I preferred the tikka masala. \n\nGarlic Naan: Got two large pieces - put them together and you have a sheet of standard printer paper. Both were smothered with butter and cilantro. Kinda tasted like they've been out for a while too. \n\nPualo - basmati rice with peas. Maybe 5 peas? I'm pretty sure the peas are there to add some color. Rice was out for a while - I eat and cook rice quite often and know what old rice tastes like. Rice was kinda hard bc it was a bit dry. Ew. \n\nCustomer service - SUCKED. Made the entire dining experience HORRIBLE. Walked in and no one acknowledges us. Restaurant is maybe 35% full so not sure what the delay was. Stood around for about 5mins and the worker who delivered the food sat us down at a corner table. Sat down, looked at the menu, hung out for 10 minutes... and the water boy came to fill our water cups. Drank some water, sat some more, stared into space, thought about pizza, people watched through the window as the workers just walked right by.. Mind you, there was one table next to us but they had already gotten the check so in our area, we're really the only 'active' customer. Finally asked the water boy if he can take our order. He pointed to a man wearing all white. The man wearing all white came and took our order. No hello, no greeting, no smile.. fine, maybe he's having a bad day. Veggie samoas came out in literally a minute. I was surprised but go figure- they were pre-made. Tikka masala, vindaloo, rice, and naan came out in 5 mins. One plus is the food comes out really fast. I'm used to my waiter coming around and asking how everything is. Didn't get that from the man dressed in white but whatever. Fortunately, everything was fine. Towards the end of our meal, another couple was sat right next to us. The man dressed in white came right away, greeted them with smile, made small talk. Their food also came out fast and though we ordered the same rice, theirs were double the size of ours. The man dressed in white even asked them how everything was as soon as their food came out. What's up with that? Anyways, finished eating and again, waiting around. No one came around so my friend and I tried to figure out the organizational structure of the staff. Man dress in white is clearly someone in charge. He's the only one that really 'interacts' with the customers. There is one guy who always delivers the food from the kitchen. There's another guy who is in charge of filling the water cups. Let me tell you - this guy takes his job VERY seriously. I take a sip and he's right there waiting to fill my cup. There's another guy who is mainly responsible for cleaning the tables and setting them up. They're all very hard workers. Unfortunately, the laziest one is the one who interacts with the customers. After figuring out all of this, we waived down the water boy to get the check. The man dressed in white came and I flashed my coupon from yelp (check-in and you get 50% off a second entree after 3pm). H came back with the check and we were thankfully out of there. \n\nI think we spent more time waiting for the staff than eating. Wouldn't ever come here again.

Tara was actually a fairly low-key Thai restaurant that had two dishes I liked and ordered often, the Hainan Chicken and the Prawn Mango Green-Papaya Salad. But that business done gone with the wind. Lawzy, we gots to have a doctor. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies. But I do know standout Bhindi Masala when I have it. Ever been to a hole-in-the-wall called Alhamra?

The complimentary Papadum (normally $2) was a nice touch even if it didn't come with any condiments (photo: http://bit.ly/1wIxe66). We decided to share two dishes, the first being the $14.95 Lamb Korma, a paucity of tender lamb chunks drowning in a sea of yogurt and cream sauce topped with almond slices (photo: http://bit.ly/1x57cgt). No kick at all, none expected. The second dish was our old standby, the $11.95 Bhindi Masala (photo: http://bit.ly/1mH2ZMs). The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript. It was a miss. We asked for the rice with peas, two servings of the Pulao (photo: http://bit.ly/1vb2kSR), which turned out to be too much. I wish the waiter would have offered some opinion on that to steer us in the right direction.

It must have happened after the credits. Tara was actually a fairly low-key Thai restaurant that had two dishes I liked and ordered often, the Hainan Chicken and the Prawn Mango Green-Papaya Salad. But that business done gone with the wind. Lawzy, we gots to have a doctor. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies. But I do know standout Bhindi Masala when I have it. Ever been to a hole-in-the-wall called Alhamra? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn, but North India ain't no Alhamra, Miss Scarlett.\n\nJamie W. and I gave it a try after work and had no trouble getting a table since the place was empty except for two other couples between whom we were strategically placed despite the fact that empty tables abound in the large space (photo: http://bit.ly/XZVKUg). The complimentary Papadum (normally $2) was a nice touch even if it didn't come with any condiments (photo: http://bit.ly/1wIxe66). We decided to share two dishes, the first being the $14.95 Lamb Korma, a paucity of tender lamb chunks drowning in a sea of yogurt and cream sauce topped with almond slices (photo: http://bit.ly/1x57cgt). No kick at all, none expected. The second dish was our old standby, the $11.95 Bhindi Masala (photo: http://bit.ly/1mH2ZMs). The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript. It was a miss. We asked for the rice with peas, two servings of the Pulao (photo: http://bit.ly/1vb2kSR), which turned out to be too much. I wish the waiter would have offered some opinion on that to steer us in the right direction. The $3.95 Kabuli Naan turned out to be more dessert-like since it was filled with fruit and nuts (photo: http://bit.ly/1sVHJzk). No complaints from me though, I thought it was pretty tasty. It also didn't stop us from ordering dessert since they were the only bargain that evening, $3.50 each. I tried the Kheer, which was a decent handling of traditional rice rice pudding (photo: http://bit.ly/1mqg6Bj), while Jamie had the Coconut Ice Cream which was marred by over-freezing (photo: http://bit.ly/1uBKLe5).

The complimentary Papadum (normally $2) was a nice touch even if it didn't come with any condiments (photo: http://bit.ly/1wIxe66).

No kick at all, none expected. The second dish was our old standby, the $11.95 Bhindi Masala (photo: http://bit.ly/1mH2ZMs). The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript. It was a miss. We asked for the rice with peas, two servings of the Pulao (photo: http://bit.ly/1vb2kSR), which turned out to be too much.

There was nice Indian music playing in the background, and it was the perfect volume, decently loud, but still quiet enough to carry on a conversation. \n\nService was very prompt and our drink and appetizer order was taken as soon as we appeared ready. We ordered a sweet lassi, a chai, samosas, and fish tikka, all of which were very tasty. I love how they served the accompanying samosa chutneys in miniature pitchers; this made them very easy to share and enjoy between three people. The fish tikka was unusual because it was fried, but it was well-seasoned. My chai was sweetened perhaps a bit too much, but the milkiness was lovely.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered navratan korma, lamb jalfrezi, dal, and garlic naan. The food came out fairly quickly after we finished our appetizer, and I appreciated that they took care to space the two courses. The presentation of the food was appetizing as well, and each dish had a sprinkle of garnish on top. The navratan korma had a pleasing gravy, with slivered nuts and an assortment of veggies. The creaminess was just right. We asked for medium spicy, but in the future I would probably request the dish to be hotter, as the gravy was still fairly mild.  While the lamb jalfrezi had a delicious sauce (similar to rogan gosht), the meat was served a bit too chewy for my taste. The dal was flavored with generous amounts of ginger, onions, and garlic, and was our favorite of the dishes that we ordered.\n\nThroughout the meal, the service was very attentive, so much so that I must have drank ten glasses of water! The server also checked on us to inquire how we were enjoying our meal and to ask if we needed any other items. When we were ready to leave, they brought us the check along with three (free) gulab jamun. So tasty! The gulab jamun were bite-sized, cardamon scented, and served piping hot. \n\nI would definitely return to North Indian restaurant to try out other items and to take in the ambience.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Gulab jamun and mango kulfi rounded off the meal.

Nevertheless, my friends and I were treated to a bounty of delicious and flavorful dishes, all of which did not disappoint.\n\nThe splurge of curries, naan bread, papadums, samosas, and basmati rice were all enough to make a grown man squeal in sheer bliss.  Sure I was hungry, but even the ravenous hunger which had overcome me could not hide the fact that this food was of the utmost quality.

The complimentary Papadum (normally $2) was a nice touch even if it didn't come with any condiments (photo: http://bit.ly/1wIxe66).

No kick at all, none expected. The second dish was our old standby, the $11.95 Bhindi Masala (photo: http://bit.ly/1mH2ZMs). The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript.
