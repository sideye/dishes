A possible cleanup allowance for the party that was held in my mouth would be nice too, but I'll be a martyr for the cause and spill it sans monetary compensation.  \n\nThe truffle is an experience all its own...almost a candy coating on the outside but really only enough of a \"shell\" to keep the gooey goodness inside from leaking all over the place.

Back off, a-holes!  I share my truffles with NO ONE!  I had to get Kung-Fu with the flying fiends in the doorway, which did make my next couple visits kinda awkward, but overall was worth my efforts.
