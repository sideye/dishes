As if their complimentary sourdough isn't fresh and delicious enough, the blue cheese garlic bread takes it to the next level. Some of the dishes that stood out to me during this dining experience were the lobster tail, oysters, and famed clam chowder. The lobster tail was extremely fresh and sweet. Add a little dash of drawn butter into a cut of it and it's absolutely to die for. The oysters were a acceptable size and one dozen for 30 dollars is a steal. They were so delicious that I ordered two dozens! I can also see why their clam chowder is famous. It was creamy with the proper texture and contained fair amounts of clams and potato. I probably wouldn't order the extra crab and sour dough bowl again. Not worth it since the chowder was delicious on its own without those two additions. \n\nThe crab legs and clams, however, were not as great as I expected. The steamed clams that we started off with tasted flavorless and contained bits of sand. The crab meat in the Shellfish Platter was quite bland as well though the meat looked fresh and intact in the legs. I will probably go with getting an entire Dungeness crab next time. I don't want to imply that the Shellfish Platter was poor in taste since the mussels and shrimp particularly were very appetizing. \n\nThe service was great and the waitress checked in periodically to make sure everything was okay.

What the No1DP asks he gets, I just happen to be the lucky woman to tag along. I had another restaurant in mind that was a little less touristy but after some research and consideration we ended up eating here instead.\n\nVENUE: We went on a Sunday night, just as the sun was about to set. The host put us in a table right next to the window. The No1DP and I were able to watch the people walking around Pier 39 and people just getting off the ferries. While the No1DP and I weren't able to secure a window that overlooked Fisherman's Wharf we weren't too far from those windows and we could look at the massive amount of tourists walking the wharf. \n\nSERVICE: Service was excellent, as expected from a fine seafood establishment. \n\nWINE: Both of us had white wines. Although I don't remember specifics on the grape varietal, I remember my wine was a little sweet and went well with my dish.\n\nFOOD\nThe Yelp check-in gets you blue cheese garlic bread. The blue cheese was a bit strong, but it's good for anyone that really likes blue cheese.\n\nWe got bowls of their famous clam chowder. One of the better clam chowders I've tasted, and the No1DP agrees. It may look watery when you're served the bowl but don't let that fool you. Instead we were treated to a quite creamy (and not starchy!) soup with good amounts of CLAM. They were quite generous with the clam but they better be considering how much you pay for a bowl!\n\nNo1DP got one of their special dishes lobster mac and cheese. As a New Englander, he has a right to be picky about his seafood, especially his lobster. His dish was \"quite comparable to an equivalent dish I'd be served back home\". Lucky him. I tried it and it's quite the rich dish - the cheese is RICH and one big bite can make you significantly fuller than before... No1DP ate less than half of his dish. The lobster was to his liking.\n\nI got another special dish: 0.5 lbs lobster stuffed with dungeness crab. I thought this would be an excellent dish as this would combine two of my great seafood loves - lobster and dungeness crab. When I was served this dish the tail part was the lobster while the head was stuffed with the crab. The crab was quite sweet, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be how the crab naturally tastes, but the sweetness took away from the crab. Lobster was excellent, soft and buttery yet I could taste the lobster.

The sugar was hard enough that I can crack it open with one swift tap of the spoon. Custard was creamy yet not too rich. The speculoos cookie they put on top was a nice touch and gave the dessert a subtle ginger taste if you eat it. \n\nThough Fog Harbor can be considered a touristy restaurant to some, the food was still excellent.

This is one of the worst fried calamari dishes I've had, and they should really re-look at their recipe. Skip!\n-Ahi Poke (Marinated Raw Tuna, Avocado, Mango, Sesame-Soy Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, $16): Ok. The tuna tasted fresh, and I liked the wasabi aioli.

Sure, offer the cocktail sauce for those who may want it, but this app screams for something more daring to help it stand above. So offer a selection of sauces. With the mussels, I didn't taste any garlic in the garlic aioli and sadly there was not enough of the cream sauce to truly enjoy it. And the sauce that accompanied the shrimp was ... eh. Could have been a lot more spicy.\n\nAs I said, our experience was good and maybe if we had gone with full-on meals rather than a sampling of apps, I might have rated it higher.

We really are in the 21st century aren't we?  \n\nI really do like Fog Harbor, it's really the only place I regularly go to in that touristy area. But be forewarned it,,like many other places in the area, can get pricier the further you look down their menu. Besides going for Happy Hour my best recommendations would be the crab cakes in the appetizer menu, which always taste hearty and fresh and are under twenty dollars as well as the award-winning clam chowder which in a sourdough bowl clocks in at 10 dollars which is quite reasonable. I've been to Fog Harbor when they're slammed and when things are slow, it's the overall quality of food and service that always makes me come back for more each and every time.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Starters: \nRed Chili Garlic Shrimp: Tangy, sweet and sour, really loved it.\n"], "author": "Sebin K.", "review": "We hit the Fog Harbor Fish house on Pier 39,Fishermans wharf for lunch.

As if their complimentary sourdough isn't fresh and delicious enough, the blue cheese garlic bread takes it to the next level. Some of the dishes that stood out to me during this dining experience were the lobster tail, oysters, and famed clam chowder. The lobster tail was extremely fresh and sweet. Add a little dash of drawn butter into a cut of it and it's absolutely to die for. The oysters were a acceptable size and one dozen for 30 dollars is a steal. They were so delicious that I ordered two dozens! I can also see why their clam chowder is famous. It was creamy with the proper texture and contained fair amounts of clams and potato. I probably wouldn't order the extra crab and sour dough bowl again. Not worth it since the chowder was delicious on its own without those two additions. \n\nThe crab legs and clams, however, were not as great as I expected.

Great view of the bay and Alcatraz, located at Pier 39 so lots of touristy things to do within walking distance. Of course, with the tourist location comes tourist prices but it's not that bad. In terms of food, their award winning clam chowder is quite good (particularly with the added crab) 4/5. We usually come for the lobster (5/5 very fresh) and Dungeness crab (5/5 the garlic is seriously good! This is their best dish!); we have had some other dishes here and there that were reliably good but nothing that springs to mind 1-2 years later. Service is usually quite good and you can get seated usually within an hour even if there is a wait - no problem there's lots to do while you wait!\n\nThis time around we got the clam chowder again as well as the seared pacific cod and the mussel fries. The mussel fries were fabulous (5/5); being a seafood house you might not expect their fries to be top notch but they are, and the cream sauce was delicious. The Pacific Cod, which was the dish recommended by our waiter, was honestly our least favorite dish that we have tried here. I generally prefer for my cod to have that juicy, oily mouthfeel and the cod was a little dry, maybe due to the thickness of the fish (don't know if you can tell from the picture but it was about 1/4 inch thick when it arrived on the table). However our waiter was fabulous at everything else, including getting our check to us early as we had lost track of time and had an upcoming appointment.\n\nMy brother usually comes with us and always gets the burger because he doesn't like seafood. It's alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger? It does comes with those delicious fries.\n\nTl;dr: great views, great service, great area, generally great food. Get the clam chowder, lobster, mussel fries, and 100% get the Dungeness crab. Don't expect too much from the non-seafood options. Expect tourist prices given it's a tourist location; to me it's worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway.

I would go with something much more subtle but enhancing, such as a delicate lemon-saffron sauce or even a lightly spiced creme fraiche. Sure, offer the cocktail sauce for those who may want it, but this app screams for something more daring to help it stand above. So offer a selection of sauces. With the mussels, I didn't taste any garlic in the garlic aioli and sadly there was not enough of the cream sauce to truly enjoy it. And the sauce that accompanied the shrimp was ... eh. Could have been a lot more spicy.\n\nAs I said, our experience was good and maybe if we had gone with full-on meals rather than a sampling of apps, I might have rated it higher.

It was hard to enjoy the fish itself even though the fish was cooked well. \n\nLastly.. Took my mom here to celebrate mothers day early and she loves crab. She ordered the shellfish platter for one. It came with half a crab, mussels, shrimp and fingerling potatoes. She was super disappointed as it lacked flavor of any kind. There was empty mussels shells and super small shrimps and the crab was tasteless. It was disappointing because she was really excited about this dish seeing other patrons order it too. But almost all her mussels were empty and her crab was cold and bland. \n\nAll in all, the view was amazing..

Either way, the food here was great.  I ordered the Cioppino and it was excellent!!

Others prefer to break-open the goodness, but I decided against a messy meal.\n\nMy wife had the mixed grilled seafood consisting of grilled salmon, swordfish and shrimp, citrus buerre blanc, sauteed vegetables and wild rice.

You can tell if many people are lounging around the outdoor seating area.    \n\nKeep an eye out on your phone because the text message is a confirmation whether or not you still want your reserved table.  The text is NOT, I repeat, NOT a message telling you your table is ready.  I learned this the hard way by reading my message 10 min. late and then responding 10 minutes later.  The hostess had thought we no longer needed our seats and gave them up to the next party on the list.  When it told her that I read the text message late, we had to wait an additional 20 min.  Our entire wait ended up being over 40 min.  She apologized and said there were too many people even after I told her that my wife was sitting at the couch next to her the whole time.

The crab was a little disappointing. There wasn't enough garlic flavor. Plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. It was just an empty shell for decoration. If a restaurant states a whole crab, I think that should include the head. The shrimp were okay. Had a nice heat, but I didn't really like the sauce. A little too sweet for me. Dinner came with complimentary Bread & Butter, which was good for soup dipping.\n\nService here was nice and friendly.

It was on overcast chilly day but the view still looked spectacular. The chowder defiantly helped us to warm up before our bike ride to the bridge. The chowder was warm, thick and flavorful. It was not salty which is my main issues with clam chowders. They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients you see the huge chunks of clams. It wasn't watered down or runny. The spices really did come through nicely. We added extra crab meat for $7. I wish the crab meat was warmed before placing it on top of the chowder. I had to mix it into the chowder to warm it up. Then we ripped off pieces of the sourdough bread bowl to dip into the chowder. It was delicious just what we needed. We also had their complimentary sourdough bread and butter before our meal came out. Can't get enough carbs! Especially good sourdough! Calamari is another tricky dish that can go wrong. But not here! The hot plate of freshly fried calamari was so good! Lemon aioli was served instead of tarter sauce. The lemon aioli really made a huge difference especially with a freshly squeezed lemon over the calamari. The surprise kicker was the deep fried slices of jalape\u00f1os to give you a surprise kick of fire. I didn't even notice it until my BF pointed them out. I tried some of the smaller pieces of jalape\u00f1o and calamari dipped into the aioli ohhhh it was the best combo. \n\nService was wonderful, server was on top of everything.

It's alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger? It does comes with those delicious fries.\n\nTl;dr: great views, great service, great area, generally great food. Get the clam chowder, lobster, mussel fries, and 100% get the Dungeness crab. Don't expect too much from the non-seafood options. Expect tourist prices given it's a tourist location; to me it's worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway.

After a lot of searching, decided to check out this place based on a large amount of positive reviews. This is an institution that serves fresh seafood and gives off a scenic view of the Pier. The dining experience and views of the Bay Area and Golden Gate Bridge attracts visitors and tourists to visit this restaurant at least once. There appeared to be a half hour wait due to how busy it was. Not a problem. The wait seemed to go by immediately and suddenly we were already inside the restaurant. Fog harbor is said to serve 100% sustainable seafood which could be a bias to anyone who hasn't tried it. The menu offers a great selection of food. Customers get to enjoy complimentary sourdough bread that is baked in house. To start off with the appetizer, we decided to go with a dozen baked oysters that consists of spinach, bacon, and creamy Parmesan sauce. These oysters were incredible. It felt like they popped right in your mouth and had so much flavor. I decided to also get the award winning clam chowder bread bowl! This was amazing as well. For the entree, I decided to go with the mixed grill platter that is made with grilled salmon, pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, saut\u00e9ed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. Food was prepared instantly and did not take long to bring out. The waiter was really friendly but did not bring out water drinks immediately to begin with. Had to give him a reminder. No problem. For a beverage, I also went with the 8 oz flint and steel Sauvignon that was recommended by the waiter. This wine pairs well with fish and had a stronger taste. I would give this restaurant 5 stars based on the food. Price is a bit on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. Amazing views depending on where you are seated along with fresh seafood right near the pier.

The garlic roasted crab had to have been at least 5 pounds, and I was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab (although she didn't even touch the corn cob and potatoes).

Sure, offer the cocktail sauce for those who may want it, but this app screams for something more daring to help it stand above. So offer a selection of sauces.

I'm seeing some photos here of that dish served with mixed greens in addition to the wild rice, but my vegetable was broccoli mixed with pearl onions and that was it. I love broccoli, but for such a delicious fish it seemed really lackluster in comparison, and the pearl onions didn't really do much to help. I would have much preferred asparagus, or at least for the broccoli to be anything other than steamed. I dipped it in the garlic sauce from my friends meal, big improvement, sad it wasn't better. \n\nThe swordfish steak, however, was perfectly tender and seasoned.

Let me explain fish by dish:\n\nChowder - they added bacon to it. I love bacon and yet bacon couldn't save this dish for me. It just tasted weird like they added lemon to it or something. It had a sour undertone for a cream soup but it didn't taste spoiled.\n\nOysters - these were pretty fresh and local according to our server. No clue what they were though but they were tiny. Decent though and my fave for the night.\n\nThe seafood platter was huge and came with dungeoness crabs, mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, and fingerling potatoes, plus one lobster tail add on. \n\nThe lobster was pretty bad. The texture was obviously over cooked and very dry. The crabs while a lot (and usually I'd be jumping with joy) was pretty dry and overdone. So we're the clams. Only the mussels and shrimps were cooked just right. Maybe it's because they baked this dish and over did it but I think steaming it would have preserved the sweetness and juiciness of the dish. \n\nTax and tip came out to be $170 USD. Really not worth it in my opinion. Not because of portion because we were full but because it just wasn't very tasty. We wanted fresh juicy seafood in SF and instead got over cooked dry seafood that could have been previously frozen for all we know. \n\nThis might have been a one off experience but being out of town, this was our first and def our last experience there.

The crowds were decent and we expected long waits regardless of where we decided to dine so we settled on splurging a little. We put our names on the wait list and after hearing the party before us (party of 4) get a 45 minute wait time we were estatic that our names were called within five minutes of putting our name on the waiting list!\n\nThe hostess seated us adjacent to the window overlooking the bay!

I'm not a big drinker but I ended up having two more...suffice to say I enjoyed them.\n\nOur main course was delicious. There was plenty to fill the bowl, large chunks of fish, mussels, a couple clams, and a set of large crab legs reaching out! My bowl had a large 'knuckle' that was packed with meat. As I deshelled the crab legs I observed I had amassed significantly more meat through my labor than what my wife had been provided in her 'lazy style' bowl...in other words 'don't be lazy'. The broth was equally delicious although I would have preferred a little more broth...regardless I was still able to splash some on my coat.\n\nWe were too full to take a look at the dessert menu as the cioppino left us with a full belly and a big smile.

As I entered their front door, the atmosphere was very remarkable and elegant as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to a first class seafood restaurant with a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean especially the Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge not too far away from the restaurant. The interior is very clean and fancy both inside and out.\n\nThe employees from servers, hosts and cookers especially chefs and bartenders are doing a fantastic job for accommodating the customers like me a sensational service despite the busiest summer environment. This server named, Samir was such a great male server. He gave me some good recommendations and suggestions especially asking a request for water refills too! No cons at all.\n\nNow onto the food! Since I was in the middle of my budget visit, I ordered their signature soup of: the Fog Harbor's Clam Chowder. As I ate that chowder (in a small bowl), that soup was tasty and outstanding. Much bolder and flavorful than my homemade clam chowder! The ingredients were fresh and new as I did feel the taste of potatoes, clam bites and the smoothness thicker broth of the soup. Such a great soup at all!\n\nParking at Fog Harbor Fish House can be difficult to park. You can park at the nearest surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Otherwise, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, public transportation, valet parking or ride sharing transportation easier without the hassles and headaches.\n\nTo conclude, Fog Harbor Fish House is the most absolute extraordinary local seafood restaurant that I've ever visited right here in San Francisco! Perfect for date nights, anniversaries or friends and family gatherings all year long! A well received visit!

It was great. \n-We couldn't decide which bottle of wine we wanted so the waiter let us all taste both! They have a pretty good wine selection.\n-For apps, we got the ahi tuna poke and the baked oysters. Both were delicious! The baked oysters were great in an interesting way... Spinach, bacon, and cheese, yum!\n\nCONS\n-Once we decided which wine we wanted, it took the waiter a realllllly long time to actually bring out our bottle (at least 20 minutes).\n-Our mom had been craving a salmon salad with bacon since well before dinner so when we saw a Salmon \"Club\" Salad on the menu, she was ecstatic! Unfortunately, when our food came out, they brought the wrong salad... It was lettuce lightly dressed and a piece of salmon on top. When she told the waiter that it was the wrong salad, all he did was take it back and add bacon. So disappointing.\n-I had the half garlic roasted dungeness crab. While it was very good, there was nothing with it. I was, at least, expecting some butter to dip my crab in.\n\nAgain, really ambivalent about this place because the food was pretty good but there were just a few blunders.

MAN!! That deserves its own rating. The four of us ordered all of the starters, entrees, and desserts (since there were only 3 selections, we double'd on the chocolate cake...best decision ever).

Well at the end of our meal, the dessert never came and neither did he.

Also, great cocktails...hibiscus margarita and the lipstick martini were sooo good. \n\nCons: Overpriced, average seafood, and mediocre portions.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.\n\nOur table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.\n\nFor the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.\n\nMy friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.\n\nFor entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.\n \nI chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*\n\nAs our desserts, we each ordered something different:\n\nThe VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.\n \nThe MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.\n \nThe CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert.

My pumpkin curry salmon tasted more like salmon soaked in PSL at Sbux than curry, but I probably shouldn't have ordered this dish as I don't care much for pumpkin spice, and am rather fond of curry.  Not very impressed at this point, as nothing I've eaten was blowing me away and the service made me feel like a nuisance instead of a treasured patron.  My partner's meal?  Delicious.  BUT!  and this is a major one, the scallops were nothing close to \"jumbo\".  They were quite small, although tasty.  The photo illustrates the size of the scallops in comparison to a dinner fork.  I would probably have a different attitude if the scallops were touted as sustainable and local instead of being labeled jumbo.  \n\nI might have a more sunny outlook on this spot if I could have seen the view it's known for, but we had already lost the sunlight for the day and could only see the nighttime lights.

We had baked oysters with Bacon, clam chowder (to dip our fresh sourdough bread in!), the mixed grill - fresh and perfectly cooked fish - and Surf N Turf... Meron even assisted with getting the meat out of the whole lobster! For dessert we had the special - Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate lava cake- absolutely delicious.

After that, she passed us off to another waiter who told us he was taking over for her because \"her shift was over\".

You missed out.\n\nFor a liberal place, San Francisco has a lot of hidden and subtle racism.

And it is disappointing that this happened because I overall had a nice trip to San Francisco and we were served great at Everett & Jones in Oakland the night before.

"], "author": "Nhu-Quynh N.", "review": "I came here for my birthday recently, and I must say, not too shabby.  I generally stroll down Pier 39 just because I love the pier/ocean view, and I've always see this restaurant.  Truth be told, I thought it was one of those upscale, dress up like a douche type restaurants.  I was wrong.\n\nI was coming from San Jose, and was planning on having dinner before I go back home.  I was craving for sea food.  You come to San Francisco, you gotta have some sea food if not steak.  Anyways, I was looking for seafood, and found some reviews that shows this place was pretty good.  I didn't know how reservations were, so I had made reservations via Yelp.  When I did it on Yelp, my reservation became at 9:30PM. Meh, lame. \n\nSo we came to Pier 39 walked around a bit, and said screw it.  Let's just ask them how long the wait is.  If it's longer than expected, we've already made reservations anyways.  So we walk up to the restaurant and their layout is quite cozy and warm for those who have to wait.  They have a nice little fireplace that will keep you warm because everyone knows Frisco can get quite cold.  So anyways, I ask the young woman at the podium about the wait time, and suggested I would like a window view.  I didn't expect it to be available considering it's around 6-7ish.  She took me by surprise and said, we are currently cleaning the table right now, and it's window view.  We sat down for like literally 2-3 minutes boom, here comes our waiter--let's go!  Omg, the view was amazing, I mean of course, I'm a sucker for scenery, but damn.  We sat towards the back, window view of the hills and the bridge, to the left was Alcatraz.  Perfect. \n\nOur waiter was Shawn, absolutely amazing.  Very fast pace, generous, and helpful on the suggestions.  My brother thought differently, felt although he could have been more helpful.  So.. Maybe I was more excited on eating than service. Who knows!\n\nOK, food:  Quite expensive if you ask me, but was it worth it? Yes and no.  Some of the items, you can go out to the fish market and get it for cheaper.  But how it was cooked, well.. Stay tuned.\n\n1/2 Oysters:  Mini oysters was what it was really.  The sauce they had made was delicious, I don't remember what it was, but I have pictures. Haha! Foodie!  It was placed over some ice to keep it cool, which everyone should place raw fish over ice, if you don't... Ugh...\n\nCrab Cakes:  Oh my, these were so good.  They were going for $16, only two pieces, which I felt kind of ripped off.  I cannot deny it, they were bomb!  Once in a while, yes worth the $16. Lol, I'm all for cheap eats.\n\nBread Bowl:  Personally, I feel although they were better than Boudins.  I had Boudins down the street where you had to get it via cafeteria style and I am not a fan. This bread bowl was much smaller though, but you could taste the clam chowder better.  Not too much breading either, just enough to distribute.\n\nFog Harbor Burger:  Made was Angus Chuck Patty was quite amazing.  Definitely cooked to perfection without asking.  Medium rare, but not too rare that it made you feel weirded out to eat it.  They got it down as far as burger goes.\n\nFog Harbor 1/2 Lobster/Crab Meat:  Ok... This was quite disappointing.  This was their current specialty on the menu, and I honestly felt like I should have just gotten a full damn lobster tail.  The crab meat was just baked crab.  Nothing special about it.  They charged me a little more than just the lobster tail.  I prefer the lobster tail so much more than to order this again.\n\nFish and Chips:  Fried to a golden texture, very delish.  On point  Not much I can really say, I didn't really eat it.  My boyfriend ordered it. :P Sorry guys\n\n\nOverall my experience was great.  The best part was that I got to see the sunset, and oh yea, even if you're not facing the window, there are mirrors so you can reflect the image.  I sat right in front which had the perfect view.  I loved it.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-05-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Great views of the dock, fresh oysters, cold beer, creamy yummy clam chowder, crusty sourdough bread, yummy I am in heaven!

We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe food was excellent, and service was stellar throughout. Our waitress was attentive without being a hovering presence, and took care of everything from corkage (it's only $12; you might do well to bring your own bottle) to dessert recommendations (more on this later--holycarp). When we asked for more lemon, she brought a plate of six nicely arranged wedges. \n\nWe started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl, which we shared. It was, as others have noted, creamy, full of clams, and not too salty. Of course you must not only dip the small wedge-shaped bread top, but also eat as much of the bread bowl as you can handle without jeopardizing your ability to put away dessert. \n\nNext came a half-dozen oysters, raw on the half-shell, with cocktail and wasabi sauces. Despite being an aggressively openminded eater, I'd somehow never had oysters before. Without the benefit of further experience, I think it's safe to say this was a good place to start. The oysters tasted very fresh, nice and briny, with a much more pleasant texture than I'd imagined.\n\nFor the entree, I got the special salmon (stuffed with crab) and Em had the mixed grill (salmon, swordfish, and prawns). Again, everything tasted absolutely fresh. All the fish was cooked perfectly--my salmon was just opaque, tender-firm and flaky. The swordfish, which I don't normally like much, was juicy and delicious. If I must pick a gripe, I'd take issue with the mixed vegetables--they were overcooked (to my taste; some of the zucchini strips were completely soggy) and unimaginative, though still a step up from the simply steamed carrot, cauliflower and broccoli you'd find at many common seafood joints. \n\nThe dessert tray offered some interesting selections alongside a couple old standbys. In addition to the expected creme brulee and apple crisp, there was a pumpkin bread pudding, some kind of individually baked chocolate cake, and a pumpkin cheesecake. My girlfriend is currently obsessed with pumpkin to what's likely an unhealthy degree, so we got the cheesecake. Moreover, our waitress said it was to die for. She never lied--eating it was like biting into the spiced flesh of an angel, only sweeter and less sacrilegious.  \n\nTwo appetizers, two entrees, corkage fee and dessert came to just over $100. You can easily pay more for less in the heart of San Francisco's #1 tourist trap. If you're not on a budget, and you want to enjoy some well-prepared seafood with minimal frills and gimmicks, you might give Fog Harbor a try.

BTW, the kids were starving after a long drive and golden gate bridge adventure.  Hubbies linguine comes back with crab on top all right.  They threw a pile of COLD crab on top of hot pasta?  Yuck.  Hubby is starving so he decided to just mix it all together to warm the crab. Shellfish mix shows back up-and now it's hot since according to our server he watched just come off the grill. I look down at what was my original plate just reheated so now the food is over done. Clams, crab and mussles are dried up. The shrimp were overcooked so they were tough-I gave these to the hubby.  The best part of this $35 plate-the corn on the cob.\nConsidering the price ($196) is about the same as our family usuals-Sardine Factory, the Whaling Station, Old Fisherman's Grotto, Saporo, etc., we were all very disappointed.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-05-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Good crab rolls, fresh oysters, ok house white & great ", "SF homemade sour dough.

For entrees, we got the seasonal Jumbo Scallop and Crab Meat Risotto and the Seafood Penne. Both were solid dishes! I loved the crab flavor in the risotto. \n\nInfamous restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf whereas the wait can be for hours. Luckily for us, Yelp Waitlist was the MVP! I wish more restaurants implement this in NYC. I simply opened my handy Yelp app and tapped to join the waitlist (must be within 40 miles) while I was commuting from my hotel in Lower Haight. It would give me an estimated time to check in with the hostess and approximately how many parties are ahead of us.

Unfortunately, when our food came out, they brought the wrong salad... It was lettuce lightly dressed and a piece of salmon on top. When she told the waiter that it was the wrong salad, all he did was take it back and add bacon. So disappointing.\n-I had the half garlic roasted dungeness crab.

I'll be recommending this place to anyone looking for the quintessential San Francisco meal with a romantic, classy, and worthwhile dining experience. \n\nThe service from start to finish was undeniably amazing. We reserved for an early dinner around 4PM, but couldn't make it (coming from South Bay) until 7:30PM for many reasons. But even though we were told that we would have to wait about 10 minutes, before we knew it we were seated after only 3 minutes! We were seated at a booth on the lower level a distance from the panoramic windows, but we loved having the grand space for our dining experience. Our server was very understanding, cracked a few jokes here and there, and was just the right amount of \"leave us alone/serve us.\" I gotta give props to the manager of the night who personally went around to all of the tables to offer an amuse-bouche...we thought it was because of SFRW, but he literally went around to all of the tables! \n\nThe food!! MAN!! That deserves its own rating. The four of us ordered all of the starters, entrees, and desserts (since there were only 3 selections, we double'd on the chocolate cake...best decision ever). FOODGASMS to the max, y'all. Even though our server said their Seafood Cioppino was the most famous dish, I think the best ones were the baked oysters (gone too soon, sadface), salmon dish and indeed the cioppino. I recommend going with the Anchor Steam to complement your entire meal! By the time desserts rolled around we were all delightfully satisfied, but loosened our belts for the BEST melt-in-your-mouth-chocolate cake and surprisingly yummy bread pudding! \n\nFog Harbor is not a joke.

I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, shrimp, and swordfish which was good. However, the swordfish was a bit dry, my salmon portion looked like it was supposed to be on a kid's plate, & my shrimp were a little small as well, considering this is a fish house. My friends ordered the swordfish and fried fish combo, which they said was satisfying but nothing to rave about... \n\nFinally, remember I mentioned we were there celebrating a friends birthday. When we first arrived, we notified the server of this not once but TWICE, and he said she would receive a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal. Well at the end of our meal, the dessert never came and neither did he. We sat for almost 30 min after we finished our meals, only to flag our server down who walked by us numerous times, not once asking how anything was. Which sucked because, I work in the food industry myself and love to tip my server more than 20% when receiving great service, but our experience unfortunately lacked the luxury of just that. \n\nPros: Setting, ambiance, and beautiful view of the wharf which is great for tourists who've never visited SF. Also, great cocktails...hibiscus margarita and the lipstick martini were sooo good. \n\nCons: Overpriced, average seafood, and mediocre portions.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.\n\nOur table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.\n\nFor the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.\n\nMy friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.\n\nFor entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.\n \nI chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*\n\nAs our desserts, we each ordered something different:\n\nThe VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.\n \nThe MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.\n \nThe CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert.

I chef a little myself so I'm pretty damn picky. The chowder served with fresh HOT sourdough was epic. My wife and debated on whose was better between them and Pike Place... but it's THAT good. I put the baked oysters on the sourdough too and pretty much went to the moon. The garlic dungeness was just heavenly. I'll get the whole one with dinner next time.\n\nWe'll be back very soon.

Our theme was seafood for our San Francisco stops, since I personally have never been to the Pacific coast and really wanted to test out what's so great about their seafood.\n\nWe reserved via OpenTable and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served.\n\nOur dinner included the \"award winning\" clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes, garlic roasted crab, wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. Well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. I understood America and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. The garlic roasted crab had to have been at least 5 pounds, and I was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab (although she didn't even touch the corn cob and potatoes). The lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. The award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name: Creamy (but not too creamy) soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. The wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we couldn't finish it. The lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really didn't taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders.\n\nService started brilliantly, and quite frankly I don't really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at 10 and we were still eating at 10:45 (I did say the portions were huge!!!).

So when I tried Fog Harbor at the Yelpin' La Vida Loca Party, the Crab Ceviche, the Ahi Tuna - I wanted to come back. I received a coupon for a free appetizer with dinner at the Yelp event, but it was the food that kept me thinking about trying it out. After having a touristy boat ride on the Bay, me and my friend went over to Pier 39 for an early dinner.\n\nDon't be fooled by the novelty of the Pier, Fog Harbor is a nice classic seafood restaurant. Nice big booths with great views of the bay to Golden Gate Bridge.  The place is huge and would be ideal for a Holiday Party, dinner party or event. They have a nice big bar that serves up anything you want, although they have quite a few custom cocktails.\n\nI ordered myself a Bloody Mary, I can appreciate a good bloody mary outside of normal brunching hours, especially if I'm enjoying some seafood.  Since we were going for the full tasting experience, we ordered the: \n\n*Ahi Tuna on a fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli  ~Absolutely delicious. I tried this at the yelp event and had to order it again.\n*Red Chili Garlic Prawns: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ~Spicy and so good, the sauce and peppers had so much flavor, I added a couple spoonfuls to my bloody mary. Yeah, it's THAT good.\n*Garlic Roasted Crab: Roasted 1/2 crab with a garlic herb butter ~At $15.00, I could eat this every night. Served with hot butter, I sat there happily cracking my crab and tasting every bit of that garlicky buttery goodness. If you need a crab fix, I highly recommend this dish. \n*Salmon BLT: Served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. ~ Really great, probably one of the best salmon sandwiches I've had. You know that feeling when you take a bite of someone's sandwich and you want more. If I wasn't so entertained cracking my crab, I'd be all over this sandwich. \n\nWhen they came up with the dessert platter, I didn't know if I could possibly do it...but there was the cr\u00e8me brulee. Just tempting me. It was just as good as expected, creamy with that sugar glazed candy crunch top.  I had my dessert with an Absolute Lemonade cocktail, very refreshing. \n\nI really enjoyed my dinner at Fog Harbor and will definitely come back.

Fog Harbor is a classy restaurant with gorgeous views in the middle of tourist central. I mean seriously, you can't get a better view than this! It also helped that after a gloomy summer, even by San Francisco standards, we had an epic weekend of beautiful weather!\n\nTo start we ordered the Red Chili Garlic Prawns and the Ahi Tuna 2 ways. The prawns were succulent and tasty and this dish definitely took me to the outer edges of my spice tolerance. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was sesame \"poke\" style with fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli. The tuna on the crispy wonton with the creamy sauce was a cool and creamy antidote for my taste buds which were still recovering from the red chili garlic prawns.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the Salmon BLT served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. I almost never finish an entire entree, but I couldn't put this thing down! Bacon truly is the miracle meat that goes great with just about anything. The sandwich came with fries and it was an extremely generous portion, I didn't come close to finishing all of them.\n\nMy dinner companion ordered the Garlic Roasted Crab, it's a roasted half crab cooked in a garlic herb butter. I didn't try this dish as I'm not much of a crab eater, but it was a sight to behold. It looks like a lot of work, but she is a gigantic crab fan and actually loves the whole process of cracking the thing open and pulling out every last tasty morsel.\n\nUsually at this point, I'm stuffed and dessert is out of the question, but we were in a mood to take it to the limit so we ordered the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was creamy, crackly and a perfect way to end the meal with a cup of coffee.\n\nNo complaints out of me when it comes to this place. It was such a beautiful day, the view was spectacular and the service outstanding.

After reading so many positive yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try.\n\nFood - we ordered seafood cioppino, fish n chips and Garlic roasted whole crab. 2 out of 3 are disappointing. The only dish which is really GREAT is seafood ciopino. The shrimps, scallops are very fresh. You can feel its original freshness even with the strong flavor soup. Highly recommended.\nFor Fish n chips, the chips are ok but the fish is obviously overcooked and very very oily. The MOST DISAPPOINTING dish is our MOST PRICEY dish- garlic roasted crab. Once I cracked the shell and trying to take out the meat, from the meat texture, I could tell it's NOT FRESH. My husband verified that since he only tasted the garlic and butter from the crab NOTHING MORE! For me, it's even worse, it's completely tasteless, maybe with a little bit of garlic flavor. But we shouldn't pay $37 for garlic and butter!! We had crab several times before from Nick's Lighthouse food stand. We can tell the difference. Nick's crabs are so fresh and with minimal processing, no garlic no butter, the meat alone is already so tasty. Our conclusion is NEVER get CRAB at FISH House. Even the crab in the seafood cioppino is tasteless. From meat texture to taste, you can definitely tell the crabs are NOT FRESH!\n\nService- we are surprised to have ALL our dishes coming out AT ONCE. I don't know if that's standard practice for seafood restaurant or not. But to us, this is SO WRONG. After we finish fish n chips(the most time sensitive dish), the rest were already cold as ice. Besides that, the service is ok, not very attentive but will do when you ask. \n\nAmbiance- the view is unbeatable, 5 stars.\n\nOther- this's the first time I saw \"SF Emp Ord 4%\" from my bill.we paid anyway. I have no clue what the heck is that. After I google it, I felt like being scammed. Why should I pay for the restaurant employee's health insurance?!That should be the restaurant's responsibility! Does that mean they treat their employees like dirt so customers have to do what they don't to keep their employees live a normal life? They don't pay insurance, customers are obligated to pay for them. They pay waiters poor salary, customers have to pay a large sum to cover it(I DO think tips are necessary for rewarding good service, just don't like it when it become obligation even for poor service) And if that really helps the employees get better health insurance, I feel better with that. But according to Wall Street Journal, mostly are just scammer and go to restaurant. I don't know about this restaurant.\n\nConclusion-It's very unlikely we will return.

You'll be able to check-in with the main host there as well.\n\nIf you're looking to skip the line and simply want to grab a bite to eat, as well as, drinks then walk on in to the bar. The bar area is open seating and it's first come first serve. You can enjoy the full menu of FHFH at the bar so that's always a win! No need to worry about a dedicated bar menu.\n\nWhen you're deciding what to eat make sure to take a look at their seasonal menu.\n\nI have to tell y'all though...\nIf you don't grab a bowl of their clam chowder, then you're doing yourself an injustice. Their clam chowder is so good you'll be licking the plate clean. You have to add crab meat to the chowder which takes it to the next level. You get such huge chunks of clam and the crab meat for $7 is A STEAL. Pretty sure you're getting way more for your buck without the messiness of opening crab legs yourself.\n\nAlthough I didn't order this due to the limitation of available space in my stomach (you can only loosen your belt so much) I have ordered their Signature Shellfish Tower which is served cold but includes lobster, dungeness crab, shrimp, and oysters.

Which were delish. \n\nThe Salmon Club Salad - this was an interesting dish and as tasty as it was it just seemed so...misplaced.  Smoked Salmon is just so better off served with romaine lettuce and shouldn't be served with the softer greens, but that's just a personal opinion. I also much admit that while the clams from the clam chowder I had earlier had a perfect smokey end taste, the salmon left a taste that made me feel like it wasn't from the freshest of waters, and lastly my tomatoes were old and browsing which wasn't so great. All in all the salad was lacking. It was good...but lacking. I think they should definitely try a romaine lettuce with it. And use fresh tomatoes. \n\nFor dessert we had the fudge brownie a la mode with whipped cream. The brownie I guess isn't a brownie but more like batter? Because it was super soft and almost like a soft grain pudding. \n\nOther than that, I'd say the views are beautiful. Like breathtakingly beautiful.

We were greeted by our waiter who took great care of us throughout dinner. He was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nWe started off our seafood feast by sharing the Red Chili Garlic Shrimp appetizer ($16). It contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce. Although I enjoyed the spicy flavors and tingling heat, I didn't find that it was the best value.  I also couldn't help but try a cup of their award-winning clam chowder ($7), which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. Yum, this is a must!  \n\nFor my entree, I went with a lighter plate, being the Seared Pacific Cod ($28). The fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. It was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. The aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and I loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. With the Cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. Two of my family members ordered the Mixed Grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.

The garlicky flavor was great and it kept wanting me to eat more and more of it each time. 5 stars.\n\nSurf and Turf: Brother wanted some meat so he settled for this. He demolished his steak and lobster but says his veggies and mash potatoes were gross. 4 stars.\n\nDrinks:\n\nThe  \"Perfect Hibiscus Margarita\" was really perfect. It was beautifully decorated and STRONG. My dad even tried it and got tipsy with this look deceiving drink. 5 stars. All that for $13.50? What a steal.\n\nMy dad's Lombard Lemonade was a refreshing drink. Again beautifully decorated and well worth the price.\n\nLarge portions, beautiful plates, and bomb drinks.

It came wrapped in a towel to preserve the warmness.  The bread tears apart so effortlessly and it goes PERFECTLY with the butter they supply you with.\n\nMy friend and I ordered non-alcoholic drinks first.  We both got the Strawberry-Basil Nojito ($7.00).  This was made with fresh mint, basil and strawberries muddled with fresh lime juice, and soda water.  I could not stop drinking this - it was super fresh and rejuvenating.  I highly recommend!\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the following:\n\nBowl of Clam Chowder ($8.00) - award winning clam chowder.  This was thick and creamy - very very tasty... paired with the sourdough bread - my god, HEAVEN!\n\nAhi Tuna Poke ($17.00) - marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli.  My first time having poke in the west coast and I was not disappointed.  They give you these sesame chips to go with the poke and it just blends so well with each other.\n\n1/2 dozen of Oysters ($15.00) - pretty standard oysters... but definitely very fresh!\n\nMixed Grilled ($26.00) - grilled salmon, swordfish and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, saut\u00e9ed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.

I wanted to take us out to a nice dinner and I chose Fog Harbor Fish House. \n\nIt was very easy to make a reservation. Visit their website, pick your party size and an available time. Easy and done. I called after doing that to nicely request a great table because of the special occasion. Parking is at the Pier 39 garage. Take your ticket with you to get validated (1st hour is free). Cross the street and go upstairs. Upon arriving, our reservation was ready to go. The table was at a window and that was great. I did see some others I would have rather had but oh well.\n\nI ordered the Lobster Tail and the better half ordered the Mixed Grill. When I got my plate it was barely warm but luckily the food wasn't cold. It looked amazing and the lobster tail was huge. I enjoyed my plate, it came with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. \n\nThe better half though, hers wasn't as appetizing. The salmon, swordfish AND the shrimp was dry. She was not enjoying her meal and that's frustrating because I am trying to make sure she has a fantastic meal! She gets embarrassed when I complain so I held off this evening.

I realize it's a busy restaurant but we are spending some money here, I don't want to feel rushed out of my table. He never told us his name or made any attempt to make the experience personable. Same with the host when we checked in, no nice welcome and no smile. \n\nOne last thing. Know I am not holding this against the restaurant. Remember I had called ahead and mentioned it was for a 5 year anniversary. Shawn who answered the phone said he would note it, I was very appreciative of that. I definitely don't expect anything from the restaurant but I was hoping for at least some recognition. An awesome 2 chair table (instead of 4 chairs), one of those corny desert dishes with a message or even a simple \"Happy Anniversary\". We got nothing.. I work in hospitality and have been a customer service professional for many years. I gave them an opportunity to shine and it wasn't taken.. Had they attempted to take the service up a step, I might have seen the experience differently or been able to look over the mistakes. I'm writing this as a mere suggestion to management, if you get the opportunity to make a personable experience for a guest, you won't regret it for going above and beyond.

After walking around for a while I was getting hungry. With so many choices I became flooded with indecision. But upon perusing the local listings this place caught my eye.\n\nI opted for a bar seat and was not disappointed. The bartender on duty was very polite and helpful. As I have never really been a seafood restaurant before. I was steered towards the combos to get a variety of seafood to try, and decided on getting a clam chowder cup, with a strawberry lemonade. And for my main course I got the fresh grilled combo. It comes with sword fish, salmon and shrimp.\n\nUpon receiving the strawberry lemonade, it was lightly sweet with a hint of sourness. A little watery, but ok. But the chowder was a real treat. It comes paired with a loaf of sourdough bread. The bread has got a nice soft, fluffy interior with a crunchy bite. By itself it is flavorful, and aromatic; but when dipped into the chowder itself it becomes a force to be reckoned with. When matted with a plat of butter the strong flavor of the sourness is apparent and the saltiness of the butter evens it out.\n\nThe chowder is smooth and creamy. Not salty nor fishy, but got a rich milky taste to it with a strong flavor of clams. Overall it is worth the money, it would be nice to see a lobster bisque offered at a place of this caliber.\n\nNow on to the main entree, the sword fish is a nice white fish. I have never had anything other than cod and halibut before so this is new. But it is very tender and mild in flavor. A slight tuna taste to it with a buttery bite. Overall a mild fish and subdued flavor.\n\nThe salmon is also extraordinarily tender, with a light crunch to the exterior. Also a light buttery taste, and more pronounced fish flavor. Which should be expected of a pink fish.\n\nAnd the shrimp is very good. Coming with a strong shrimp flavor, nice a fresh and hot. It has a light initial crunch, and a medium bite to it afterwards. There is a subtle butter, lemon taste to it, that compliments the shrimp flavor.\n\nThe sides that came with it is sauteed veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. And I opted to get some french fries instead. The garlic mashed potatoes seems to be a fresh variant as it has lumps of potato in it. And is fairly moist and creamy. Although In my opinion it is always well paired with a country gravy to further make the texture creamy and rich. The french fries are crunchy with a fluffy interior. A little on the salty side, but again not bad.\n\nSo in this honest reviewers opinion, the soup paired with the bread is fantastic, the lemonade is ok, the main entree is also fantastic, but the sides are a bit waning compared to the rest of the meal. So between the service and the attributes listed I would give it a solid 9/10 for the price class it is in. Compared to higher end restaurants could bump it down to a 7.5/10.

We had no reservations, 6 of us on a Saturday night, they were packed, yet we were seated in half hour--impressive. I was blown away with the ambience inside: cavernous space, floor to ceiling windows, sweeping gorgeous views of the water, picturesque boats docking, sun glistening, charming landscape. We were seated on the more intimate and quiet upper level, white tablecloths banquette. Our server was energetic, warm, sweet, eager to please. Throughout the meal he was engaged and responsive, proactive, came back to check on us several times and was endlessly patient, e.g. my niece and nephew had an attack of paralysis over the dessert :-) The food: holy sweet mother of God, WTF are these people doing in the kitchen? They're rocking the shit out of it, is what. For starters: shellfish platter and caesar salad. The complimentary bread are rolls, mini sourdough dutch crunch bites, but with a dense, toothsome texture.  A basket of these with soft consistency butter. Gluten-free be damned, I scarfed down 2. The caesar is whole romaine leaves, dressed with a tangy anchovy/egg based dressing, a beautiful balance of tart and creamy, simple yet beyond. The shellfish platter is a sight: half crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, fingerling potatoes roasted with butter, garlic, herbs, lemon wedges. The remarkable thing: it's more than the sum of its parts, not disparate items arranged on a platter. Everything is a symphony. The fish screams pristine FRESH ... this is what SF should be and damn if I wasn't proud to be a local. I got the Seared Pacific Cod,  white beans infused with chorizo butter, spinach, topped with garlic  aioli. This dish left all of us agape--it's an ode to hearty flavors of smoky white beans and wilted spinach, tiny bits of tomato, the broth a rich base. Fyi, cod doesn't usually excite me, but because of the freshness and charred seared cooking technique, I'm a convert. My husband had the cioppino: salmon chunks, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels stewed in a tomato seafood broth, which was the perfect consistency, not overly thick and not watery either, with a kick of spice, more like lingering heat than a kick to the palate. Neither my niece and nephew, nor my brother had tried cioppino before, and it was unanimous: they loved it. My brother had their crab meat topped filet mignon with a demi glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach. He likes his meat medium well, and they cooked it within an inch of perfection--melt in your mouth tender, yet done all the way through, flavorful with the crab finishing touch, and again the dish came together like a music riff. My sister in law had their fish and chips, and while she loved the fish, the fries she prefers to be thick and soft, rather than skinny and crunchy, but that's not a cooking thing, it's more of a personal preference. My niece and nephew ordered their lobster mac n cheese, and while it's clearly full of quality ingredients, it was a tad dry and not creamy enough. Did I mention that I had their non-alcoholic ginger beer, soda with a strong ginger punch, pieces of fresh ginger over crushed ice. After our entrees, our server, whose name I wish I'd gotten to applaud him publicly, came over with a dessert tray, and asked me to pick out whatever I wanted. We settled on the chocolate banana bread pudding, made with Boudin's fresh sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate and topped with vanilla bean sauce. I usually hate bread pudding, it's an oxymoron--\"bread\" and \"pudding\" cancels each other out, right? NOT! Bittersweet chocolate, fresh banana, spooned into creamy decadent consistency, delicate vanilla sauce. 6 of us lunging for that plate was not a pretty sight :-)  Our server came over to take out photo and sang happy birthday, all of them so obviously enjoying being there and taking pride in doing their job well--thank you all of you, and I promise when I return, I'll make a point of getting all your names--you deserve a public shout out :-)  Hours later, as we wound down our dinner, it was dark outside and fireworks exploded outside, massive coronas of light, yellow and red in bursts of sunlike spirals ... it was a gift out of nowhere, a spontaneous  celebratory bang and perfect ending to the meal.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Love the green tea and the crab stuffed salmon so much!!!"], "author": "Jane L.", "review": "Very delicious though costs a bit high.\nLove the green tea and the crab stuffed salmon so much!!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-01-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The scallops, the mussels and the salmon were cooked however there weren't any flavors to it from the curry/sauce."], "author": "Sebin K.", "review": "We hit the Fog Harbor Fish house on Pier 39,Fishermans wharf for lunch.

Our server was very understanding, cracked a few jokes here and there, and was just the right amount of \"leave us alone/serve us.\" I gotta give props to the manager of the night who personally went around to all of the tables to offer an amuse-bouche...we thought it was because of SFRW, but he literally went around to all of the tables! \n\nThe food!! MAN!! That deserves its own rating. The four of us ordered all of the starters, entrees, and desserts (since there were only 3 selections, we double'd on the chocolate cake...best decision ever).

I mean, we're in San Francisco, am I right?!\n\nWe ended up at Pier 39 / Fisherman's Wharf not long after our gruelingly mediocre Bartlett Hall experience. We didn't have much in our stomachs by high noon, which meant the immediate need to fill them with grub hit us in full force. \n\nFog Harbor Fish House appeared to be THE SPOT.. mainly because we were right below it.. and our desperate attempts to eat were dwindling down to a either: wait patiently for a hearty meal or begrudgingly snack on munchies along the bay. We laughed at the snack idea and proceeded to head upstairs towards Fog Harbor. The hostess upfront / outside took our names, then informed us it'd be around a 25 minute wait. Within seconds after our groups arrival, the line became that of a Black Friday sale at Best Buy. We were lucky enough to snag a spot in the little patio section by the front bar, fireplace by our sides, and amusingly watched fellow tourists shiver in those chilly northern California temperatures. \n\nAside from the crowd outside, the folks inside seemed mild mannered and less talkative than I'd imagine a spot like Fog Harbor would be. We were sat at nice corner table with easily one of the best views in the house that was accompanied by a pleasant server. And though I couldn't verify this, because our spot was visually stunning.. it seemed most seats within the restaurant gave a decent glimpse of the surrounding Bay and Pier 39. The decor itself was almost on the classy-scale but in far too touristy of a spot to be labeled this. \n\nIt looked like every single table had at least ONE bowl of clam chowder sitting atop them, and because it was on our minds prior to our arrival, it was a dish we'd all be ordering without even looking at the menu. Strategy in mind, we ordered regular bowls of Clam Chowder WITHOUT bread as the bowl.. because, you know, most restaurants provide COMPLIMENTARY BREAD.. so all that excess yeast is simply unnecessary, folks. Unless.. bread is yo' thing. Then do whatcha wanna do, baby. \n\nAlong with the clam chowder (and free bread) I ordered the Mixed Grill Plate - Grilled salmon, swordfish & shrimp covered in a (buttery) citrus buerre blanc served with sides of sauteed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe mixed grill plate was phenomenal. I'm a fan of blackened fish, the taste of the grill and proper seasoning.. and everything on the plate was that exactly.

(My grunts, smiles, giggles, muffled speech, or if I look drunk without drinking, etc.)\n\nThe clam chowder was, for lack of better terms, doo-doo. Just about every bite had sand in it. Strange.. it appeared there wasn't much clam in my bowl.. which made the sand ordeal a somewhat mind-boggling. Because of this, I didn't enjoy nor finish their 'Award Winning' Clam Chowder. I would've dipped my head into the Pacific if I wanted to taste as much sand as that.\n\nA thin line between a 3 and a 4, Fog Harbor Fish House (through my eyes) may not have the best clam chowder as claimed.. but was boosted in a positive direction due to solid / attentive service, views truly pleasing to the eyes and all of our food (aside from chowder) was tasty and fulfilling for our once empty stomachs.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-11-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, shrimp, and swordfish which was good.

We started with the 1/2 dozen baked oysters, along with the blue cheese wedge salad and a cup of clam chowder. Salad was very good and portion was more than enough, along with the chowder which had a great taste and was served piping hot. However, as for the oysters, they were very tasty and seasoned very well, but they were lukewarm and almost miniature sized. For 18$, I can get a dozen and 1/2 oysters at the grocery store, and twice the size of those in which they were serving. So that was a bit disappointing, especially at a restaurant right on the wharf. \n Our server, I'm not sure of his name, was nice at the beginning and then he virtually disappeared after we received our entrees. I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, shrimp, and swordfish which was good. However, the swordfish was a bit dry, my salmon portion looked like it was supposed to be on a kid's plate, & my shrimp were a little small as well, considering this is a fish house. My friends ordered the swordfish and fried fish combo, which they said was satisfying but nothing to rave about... \n\nFinally, remember I mentioned we were there celebrating a friends birthday. When we first arrived, we notified the server of this not once but TWICE, and he said she would receive a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal. Well at the end of our meal, the dessert never came and neither did he. We sat for almost 30 min after we finished our meals, only to flag our server down who walked by us numerous times, not once asking how anything was. Which sucked because, I work in the food industry myself and love to tip my server more than 20% when receiving great service, but our experience unfortunately lacked the luxury of just that. \n\nPros: Setting, ambiance, and beautiful view of the wharf which is great for tourists who've never visited SF.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.\n\nOur table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.\n\nFor the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.\n\nMy friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.\n\nFor entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.\n \nI chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*\n\nAs our desserts, we each ordered something different:\n\nThe VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.\n \nThe MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.\n \nThe CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert.

What we received was more like a calculated and rushed meal you'd expect at a mid-grade chain restaurant.  \n\nWe started with oysters and never received any utensils to dress them with, so we poured the condiments on with reluctance.  Next came salads, which didn't dazzle us, but neither were they intolerable.  I ordered the \"fall special\" of Pumpkin Curry Salmon, face-palm #2. My partner requested the \"Jumbo\" Scallops for his entree. My pumpkin curry salmon tasted more like salmon soaked in PSL at Sbux than curry, but I probably shouldn't have ordered this dish as I don't care much for pumpkin spice, and am rather fond of curry.  Not very impressed at this point, as nothing I've eaten was blowing me away and the service made me feel like a nuisance instead of a treasured patron.  My partner's meal?  Delicious.  BUT!  and this is a major one, the scallops were nothing close to \"jumbo\".  They were quite small, although tasty.  The photo illustrates the size of the scallops in comparison to a dinner fork.  I would probably have a different attitude if the scallops were touted as sustainable and local instead of being labeled jumbo.  \n\nI might have a more sunny outlook on this spot if I could have seen the view it's known for, but we had already lost the sunlight for the day and could only see the nighttime lights.  I wish I had tried the chowder they're known for, and maybe I would have been more impressed.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-10-31"}, {"excerpts": ["The salmon was fresh and nice although there were a few too many onions on top.

For desert we had tbe chocolate bread pudding. I am not a fan of bread pudding but this was VERY good! I believe this place is known for fresh made sourdough bread.

Readers discretion, I did have my toddler with me, who by the way was actually a saint tonight, even though, I thought a slow night, not a lot of stuck up kid hating people, shouldn't be too bad. Well... Too bad so Sad. Here's what happened: So we first get sat in a booth facing the window. The hostess must of not had a lot of experience with children because as she walked off, I had to call her back and ask for a high chair, she looked at me with puzzlement and semi annoyance, and says: \"well you can sit here with a high chair?!\"...DUH!! I could have told her that. So, naturally I think, well they're a couple 2 and 4 tops (tables) in plain site next to the window where we can replace a chair with a high chair, no problem! Think again, she sticks me in the far back of the restaurant, farthest away from the window!! WTF!! By this point, my own enjoyment was out of the question, I have to feed my kid and I'm starving, not worth the fight anymore because this \"hostess\" was obviously discriminatory towards anyone with a kid , and or was just plain clueless about what she was suppose to do. \nFood was ok, had the Salmon BLT, which was cooked well. I was looking forward to desert, but the waitress either got busy or was tired of dealing with a quiet table and just dropped off the check.

Overall, very high marks. First, the view is lovely, and the restaurant itself is very nice and well-appointed. A nice place for a relaxed lunch, date night or a special occasion. Second, the food:\n-I ordered the ginger coconut cocktail, which was generally very good and tasty, but I felt had a bit too much coconut. It was kind of offputting in mouthfeel but did have a delightful ginger/lemon/spritzer type of flavor. I was torn between loving it and hating it and in the end only drank about half.\n-The chowder. Oh my god, get some.Some of the best chowder you will ever have. Thick, creamy, silky, delicious. Think cup, but go bowl. You're welcome.\n-Poke. I do love tuna, so poke is a tough thing to ignore on a menu that isn't in Hawaii. This particular poke is mixed with fresh avocado and mango, with a small amount of seaweed like you'd find in a seaweed salad. Light, gingery, soy-ey (??) and really yum.\n-Salmon. I got the salmon entree, which was just delicious. Cooked perfectly, with a med-rare center and beautiful grill marks on the outside, set over a creamy sauce with spinach and potatoes. A beautiful piece of fish and a huge portion!\n-Tuna -- perfectly cooked again with a nice big rare center. Served over a great hash-like mix that included these delightful bits of bok choy. SUPER yum.\n\n\nIn all the food was really excellent. We didn't have time for dessert. Our server was good, helpful and composed.

There were even people waiting for seats. When you first enter Fog Harbor, you'll notice that they have a really cozy fireplace area for those who are waiting.

Methinks not\" definitely sums it up...\n\nThe in-laws took my husband and me here for his birthday since he wanted seafood at Pier 39 and Fog Harbor had the best Yelp reviews...this is the first time Yelp has steered us oh so very wrong.\n\nAs far as the service goes, they started out on the right foot by saying the wait for a table was 45 minutes to an hour and we were seated in 30...it's all downhill from there. For being a busy Saturday night, none of the wait staff had any sense of urgency; the speed with which they walked was like they were window shopping at a mall. The 20 minute wait for water and the 90 minutes we waited for our dinner were testament to that. Also, the waitress was really inefficient and/or did not have a good memory. Any time I eat out I like to ask for anything we need all at once so the waiter/waitress doesn't have to make several trips...our waitress literally brought us one item at a time. Her favorite line was \"I'll be right back with that;\" yeah, you'll be back in another 10 minutes. Perfect example: the food had finally come out and we asked for drink refills (water, hot water with lemon, and coffee), ketchup, and a crab cracker (which, for some reason, didn't come out with the plate)...3 trips and 20 minutes later, we had everything but the ketchup. It took her so long to bring the cracker for the crab that my mother-in-law ordered that she started breaking into it with her hands, and I never did get ketchup for my fries. Our table did have a nice view, but one of the staff opened the window shade too early and it blinded my father-in-law. He asked if he could lower it again and the guys response was, \"It'll just be bright for a couple of minutes\" and then walked away. Pretty much all the guests had the same response to the bright light, so a manager lowered them, saying rudely it would just be another 30 seconds and it should have been fine, then proceeded to stand near the table while keeping an eye on his watch. The same guy as the first time came around to open the blinds again and was making rude comments as he worked.\n\nMoving on to the food, I'll start with the good...the clam chowder, shrimp, clams, mussels, and whole crab were actually tasty. Not worth the price-tag they slapped on it, but at least tasty. The calamari was ok, kinda chewy, honestly the lemon aioli it came with was the best part. The salmon and swordfish were overcooked, dry, and bland and all of the vegetables that came on the sides were undercooked (seriously, undercooked fingerling potatoes?) except the spinach, which was overcooked. I ordered the crab roll (sandwich) and the best part about it was the bread, which was a good thing since there was a lot of it.\n\nJust considering the food and service we had while dining here, none of us would rate Fog Harbor very highly...once you throw in the $180 we spent for this lovely experience, we will not only never go back, but would recommend everyone to eat anywhere but here.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-08-09"}, {"excerpts": ["The mixed grill was amazing the salmon and swordfish was the best I have ever had.

So when I tried Fog Harbor at the Yelpin' La Vida Loca Party, the Crab Ceviche, the Ahi Tuna - I wanted to come back. I received a coupon for a free appetizer with dinner at the Yelp event, but it was the food that kept me thinking about trying it out. After having a touristy boat ride on the Bay, me and my friend went over to Pier 39 for an early dinner.\n\nDon't be fooled by the novelty of the Pier, Fog Harbor is a nice classic seafood restaurant. Nice big booths with great views of the bay to Golden Gate Bridge.  The place is huge and would be ideal for a Holiday Party, dinner party or event. They have a nice big bar that serves up anything you want, although they have quite a few custom cocktails.\n\nI ordered myself a Bloody Mary, I can appreciate a good bloody mary outside of normal brunching hours, especially if I'm enjoying some seafood.  Since we were going for the full tasting experience, we ordered the: \n\n*Ahi Tuna on a fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli  ~Absolutely delicious. I tried this at the yelp event and had to order it again.\n*Red Chili Garlic Prawns: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ~Spicy and so good, the sauce and peppers had so much flavor, I added a couple spoonfuls to my bloody mary. Yeah, it's THAT good.\n*Garlic Roasted Crab: Roasted 1/2 crab with a garlic herb butter ~At $15.00, I could eat this every night. Served with hot butter, I sat there happily cracking my crab and tasting every bit of that garlicky buttery goodness. If you need a crab fix, I highly recommend this dish. \n*Salmon BLT: Served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. ~ Really great, probably one of the best salmon sandwiches I've had. You know that feeling when you take a bite of someone's sandwich and you want more. If I wasn't so entertained cracking my crab, I'd be all over this sandwich. \n\nWhen they came up with the dessert platter, I didn't know if I could possibly do it...but there was the cr\u00e8me brulee. Just tempting me. It was just as good as expected, creamy with that sugar glazed candy crunch top.  I had my dessert with an Absolute Lemonade cocktail, very refreshing. \n\nI really enjoyed my dinner at Fog Harbor and will definitely come back.

He was very knowledgable and helpful, and knew exactly what he was talking about.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer.  This was a FULL plate too, it wasn't just a few pieces.  They really were generous, and it was delicious.  Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we got the appetizers.  Of course the bread bowl was delicious, and my boyfriends salmon was amazing!

We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe food was excellent, and service was stellar throughout. Our waitress was attentive without being a hovering presence, and took care of everything from corkage (it's only $12; you might do well to bring your own bottle) to dessert recommendations (more on this later--holycarp). When we asked for more lemon, she brought a plate of six nicely arranged wedges. \n\nWe started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl, which we shared. It was, as others have noted, creamy, full of clams, and not too salty. Of course you must not only dip the small wedge-shaped bread top, but also eat as much of the bread bowl as you can handle without jeopardizing your ability to put away dessert. \n\nNext came a half-dozen oysters, raw on the half-shell, with cocktail and wasabi sauces. Despite being an aggressively openminded eater, I'd somehow never had oysters before. Without the benefit of further experience, I think it's safe to say this was a good place to start. The oysters tasted very fresh, nice and briny, with a much more pleasant texture than I'd imagined.\n\nFor the entree, I got the special salmon (stuffed with crab) and Em had the mixed grill (salmon, swordfish, and prawns). Again, everything tasted absolutely fresh. All the fish was cooked perfectly--my salmon was just opaque, tender-firm and flaky. The swordfish, which I don't normally like much, was juicy and delicious. If I must pick a gripe, I'd take issue with the mixed vegetables--they were overcooked (to my taste; some of the zucchini strips were completely soggy) and unimaginative, though still a step up from the simply steamed carrot, cauliflower and broccoli you'd find at many common seafood joints. \n\nThe dessert tray offered some interesting selections alongside a couple old standbys. In addition to the expected creme brulee and apple crisp, there was a pumpkin bread pudding, some kind of individually baked chocolate cake, and a pumpkin cheesecake. My girlfriend is currently obsessed with pumpkin to what's likely an unhealthy degree, so we got the cheesecake. Moreover, our waitress said it was to die for. She never lied--eating it was like biting into the spiced flesh of an angel, only sweeter and less sacrilegious.  \n\nTwo appetizers, two entrees, corkage fee and dessert came to just over $100. You can easily pay more for less in the heart of San Francisco's #1 tourist trap. If you're not on a budget, and you want to enjoy some well-prepared seafood with minimal frills and gimmicks, you might give Fog Harbor a try. We left thoroughly stuffed, and very happy.\n\nPS: Parking is $7/hr in the nearby Pier 39 garage, but dinner will get you 2 hours free if you remember to validate (NB: I did not remember to validate).", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-12-20"}, {"excerpts": ["He said that everything on it was excellent but the salmon blew him away.

Each time we went we got the same server named \"Bong\" - who has now become our favorite server.  He was excellent! Some things we tried that I would definitely recommend - the Clam Chowder (has to be THE BEST I've ever had) - the Red Chili Shrimp - the Shellfish Platter (lots of food) - the Salmon BLT - and for appetizers try the Fried Scallops, Baked Oysters or Calamari.

"], "author": "Ranjan P.", "review": "My bias: Pier 39 a tourist trap, mediocre food, not birthday worthy food, but my niece and nephew wanted to go here, and I couldn't refuse them. We had no reservations, 6 of us on a Saturday night, they were packed, yet we were seated in half hour--impressive. I was blown away with the ambience inside: cavernous space, floor to ceiling windows, sweeping gorgeous views of the water, picturesque boats docking, sun glistening, charming landscape. We were seated on the more intimate and quiet upper level, white tablecloths banquette. Our server was energetic, warm, sweet, eager to please. Throughout the meal he was engaged and responsive, proactive, came back to check on us several times and was endlessly patient, e.g. my niece and nephew had an attack of paralysis over the dessert :-) The food: holy sweet mother of God, WTF are these people doing in the kitchen? They're rocking the shit out of it, is what. For starters: shellfish platter and caesar salad. The complimentary bread are rolls, mini sourdough dutch crunch bites, but with a dense, toothsome texture.  A basket of these with soft consistency butter. Gluten-free be damned, I scarfed down 2. The caesar is whole romaine leaves, dressed with a tangy anchovy/egg based dressing, a beautiful balance of tart and creamy, simple yet beyond. The shellfish platter is a sight: half crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, fingerling potatoes roasted with butter, garlic, herbs, lemon wedges. The remarkable thing: it's more than the sum of its parts, not disparate items arranged on a platter. Everything is a symphony. The fish screams pristine FRESH ... this is what SF should be and damn if I wasn't proud to be a local. I got the Seared Pacific Cod,  white beans infused with chorizo butter, spinach, topped with garlic  aioli. This dish left all of us agape--it's an ode to hearty flavors of smoky white beans and wilted spinach, tiny bits of tomato, the broth a rich base. Fyi, cod doesn't usually excite me, but because of the freshness and charred seared cooking technique, I'm a convert. My husband had the cioppino: salmon chunks, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels stewed in a tomato seafood broth, which was the perfect consistency, not overly thick and not watery either, with a kick of spice, more like lingering heat than a kick to the palate. Neither my niece and nephew, nor my brother had tried cioppino before, and it was unanimous: they loved it. My brother had their crab meat topped filet mignon with a demi glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach. He likes his meat medium well, and they cooked it within an inch of perfection--melt in your mouth tender, yet done all the way through, flavorful with the crab finishing touch, and again the dish came together like a music riff. My sister in law had their fish and chips, and while she loved the fish, the fries she prefers to be thick and soft, rather than skinny and crunchy, but that's not a cooking thing, it's more of a personal preference. My niece and nephew ordered their lobster mac n cheese, and while it's clearly full of quality ingredients, it was a tad dry and not creamy enough. Did I mention that I had their non-alcoholic ginger beer, soda with a strong ginger punch, pieces of fresh ginger over crushed ice. After our entrees, our server, whose name I wish I'd gotten to applaud him publicly, came over with a dessert tray, and asked me to pick out whatever I wanted. We settled on the chocolate banana bread pudding, made with Boudin's fresh sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate and topped with vanilla bean sauce. I usually hate bread pudding, it's an oxymoron--\"bread\" and \"pudding\" cancels each other out, right? NOT! Bittersweet chocolate, fresh banana, spooned into creamy decadent consistency, delicate vanilla sauce. 6 of us lunging for that plate was not a pretty sight :-)  Our server came over to take out photo and sang happy birthday, all of them so obviously enjoying being there and taking pride in doing their job well--thank you all of you, and I promise when I return, I'll make a point of getting all your names--you deserve a public shout out :-)  Hours later, as we wound down our dinner, it was dark outside and fireworks exploded outside, massive coronas of light, yellow and red in bursts of sunlike spirals ... it was a gift out of nowhere, a spontaneous  celebratory bang and perfect ending to the meal.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-25"}], "grilled shrimp brochette": [{"excerpts": ["I had the Grilled Shrimp Brochette (sauteed spinach, butternut squash, garlic mashed potatoes, $22).

We went last Friday and it is Lent, so I don't eat meat. The hub searched for seafood places and came across this place on Yelp with high ratings. It did not disappoint, and as a local, I'm glad. \n\nThe menu said that the clam chowder was award winning, so we had to try it. It was delicious --thick, creamy, flavorful, with big chunks of clam, not like other places that use extra potatoes for filler. $7 for a cup.\n\nMy husband had the Shellfish Platter (half crab, mussels, clams, & fingerling potatoes -$39 for one) and added a lobster tail (5-6oz, $24). He enjoyed all of it, but says the one thing he'd dock a star for is that the crab was a little dry. I had the Grilled Shrimp Brochette (sauteed spinach, butternut squash, garlic mashed potatoes, $22). The shrimp were a good size, it was flavorful, but a tad oilier than I like. \n\nYes, we had dessert! For him: Apple Crisp a la mode. For me: as if I'd have anything other than tiramisu. They were both very good. $9 each. The tiramisu was probably one of the best I've had-- creamy and not over-soaked w/ espresso & liqueur like many others. \n\nI'd give this probably 4 stars, however our server, Brianna (assuming that was her name-- it was on our receipt!), really made the difference. Add another star just for her. She was welcoming from the start, friendly, not pushy, and kept checking on us. What gave us a good chuckle was that as we were leaving, she she wished us a nice \"rest of your vacation,\" assuming we were tourists. We had a nice, quick chat w/ her and made our way out.

Their chowder was also rewarded best in SF! \n\nSeafood Penne $23 - The sauce for this was really favorable, but it didnt exactly \"wow\" me. The overall portion of the dish looked to be large, but once you get into it there was not a lot of penne within the actual dish. However, there was definitely a decent amount of seafood to compensate! For a small girl, i found that this dish was just enough for me. \n\nAlaskan Halibut $34 - This was part of their seafood menu. A bit of a disappointment. Although the fish was very soft and fresh, it lacked flavor. We are more so people who enjoy more flavor in our dishes. Had to use sauce from the pasta so the fish wouldnt be so bland. \n\nApple Crisp $8.50 - We came here for our anniversary, so they gave us a complimentary dessert. So nice of them! At the end of your meal, the server will come out with a tray of desserts to choose from - you select the one you want and they will prepare you a new one from the back. I was silly and was about to grab it right off the tray. The Apple Crisp was delicious. Not too sweet and served with vanilla ice cream.

The flavors inside were a nice bitterness of, what I assume, is coffee and a sweetness from the whipped cream on the side and the filling inside.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.\n\nOur table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.\n\nFor the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.\n\nMy friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.\n\nFor entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.\n \nI chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*\n\nAs our desserts, we each ordered something different:\n\nThe VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.\n \nThe MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.\n \nThe CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert.

I thought that was odd and made another reservation at approximately the same time. The day of my reservation I got a call from the restaurant asking if I really wanted two reservations or was that a mistake. I said I only needed one but my open table reservation had been cancelled and so I made another. The woman on the phone said the original reservation was on their books even though it wasn't on my open table app. As soon as I hung up the phone-my 2nd reservation was cancelled as well! So I ended up not getting the open table 100 points. I just thought that was strange but the experience at the restaurant made up for losing my 100 points. We were seated at a table in the bar area that I chose because it was pretty warm in the restaurant and this area was the coolest place. (I have hot flashes and a cool spot wins over a view any day) Our server Ron C came over and took our drink and appetizer order. I had the Perfect Hibiscus Margarita $12.5 (Voted SF Weekly's Best Margarita) \nEl Charro Reposado, Patron Citronge, hibiscus syrup, fresh lime and agave served up and topped with Patron Citronge foam.\nIt was literally perfect and I very rarely order drinks in a restaurant because I am sooooo picky. I send more drinks back than I drink. \nWe ordered a crab Louis salad as an appetizer and it was HUGE and delicious. We didn't expect it to be as large as it was. House made dressing was the cherry on top of this perfectly made salad. For my entree Ron suggested  the Ahi Tuna $26\nSeared \"RARE\", sesame seed crust, ginger soy glaze, wasabi aioli, stir fried vegetables and garlic jasmine rice. I prefer medium rare so I ordered it that way and it came out perfectly. I keep using that word but I am serious when I say-I am a hard to please diner and this place was just hitting it out of the park. My husband and daughter couldn't believe it. My husband ordered the Cioppino $33\nCrab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels, stewed in a seafood tomato broth, and he was very happy-he called it the best he's ever had.  It was a huge portion and that always makes him happy as well. \nOur 16 year old daughter did not find anything on the menu that she wanted so I encouraged her to order the clam chowder and caesar salad plate. She loves a caesar salad but she did not like the clam chowder. When Ron noticed that she basically hadn't touched it he commiserated with her about living in San Francisco and not liking clam chowder. He took it off the bill even though we told him not to since she had eaten the salad! In the end she ordered the  Blondie Sundae $8.5:\nChocolate chip style brownie square with walnuts, topped with vanilla ice cream, biscoff cookie crumbles and a biscoff sweet spread drizzle. Dessert is always her favorite. Juan the manager came over and asked us how our meal was and we told him how amazing it was and how accommodating our server was. He then told us that he wanted to comp our daughter's dessert because she didn't like her clam chowder. I was shocked. I mean they had already took it off the bill and then gave her a free dessert??? We didn't ask for any of that. I am truly impressed with their commitment to making their diners happy.

Around 9pm on a Saturday night, we ended up waiting a little under 30 minutes for a table. Service was great; from the hostess to our server.

They are the cleanest oysters I've ever tasted. I could've eaten half a dozen by myself.\n\n- Ahi Tuna Poke: Decent size chunks with avocado and I believe it was mango as well? The Sriracha drizzled around the plate adds a kick of spice if that's what you're looking for. Down side to this plate was that there was only 3 wonton chips to share! \n\n- Clam Chowder: You can't come to SF and not have a bowl of clam chowder. You won't regret it! So rich and creamy, you can actually tell that there are clams in there! (Also had clam chowder from Nick's Lighthouse... Fog Harbor blows them out of the water) \n\n- Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab: YUMMY. So glad we went with this over the steamed dungeness. It had so much more flavor to it and was way more juicy than we expected, which is a definitely plus. (Tip: Dip the corn into the garlic/butter... Also, if you prefer mashed potatoes to the fingerling potatoes, just ask your server to substitute it for you)\n\nOverall, we had a great experience.

We ordered the ahi tuna poke which I really enjoyed and my friend had the crab dip which absolutely loved and devoured. When the main meals arrived my friend had the chowder and said it wasn't really all that special and was just ok. I ordered a plate of clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and corn. The dish was absolutely COVERED in Garlic....there so much garlic everywhere and I had a hard time scraping it off. The clams were ok and there wasn't too much to the mussels. The corn was ridiculous as you couldn't really bite into it but if you scraped it with your teeth you might actually get a little bit. The whole dish was hard to eat because of the ridiculous amount of garlic. It was like someone took about 6-8 whole garlic, minced it and to threw it in.

Since he's the planner in this family, I gave him the task of finding a  restaurant that had strong reviews. We wanted something that was unique to San Francisco with a heavy emphasis on seafood selections. We don't eat mammals and our diet that is pretty much that of a pescatarian/vegetarian. \n\nWhat baffled us was that we booked our reservation via OpenTable a couple of months in advance. What we noticed was that their reservations were booked ahead of time and that we needed to secure a spot right away. So we set it up for the two of us a couple of months before we even arrived.\n\nFog Harbor is located at Pier 39, right off of The Embarcadero. It's on the second level of the shopping district, at the top of the stairs. This is an ideal location because it's right at the entrance to Pier 39 so you can't miss it. There are other restaurant chains there but when you travel, you want something different from what you already have back home.\n\nAnyway, I didn't know that my husband's coworker would be joining us for dinner. So I called Fog Harbor and asked if it would be ok if I added one more person to the reservation. They said that it was alright. However, I wasn't aware that his coworker was also bringing his mother and brother who were visiting from New Jersey. Now we were faced with a situation!!!  The initial reservation went from 2 to 3 people and was now at a total of 5 people. So I explained the situation to the hostess and she gave me that look that a teacher gives their students. It wasn't good BUT she gave us the option of waiting for a table to open up OR be seated at one of the elevated tables away from the window. We were hungry so we went for the second option. As it turned out, we still had a nice view of the water as well as The Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe menu has a heavy seafood emphasis which was right up our alley. I was tempted to try to swordfish fish but I was more intrigued with the Pacific Sole. It was served on a bed of spinach and fingerling potatoes. This was one of those cases in which the food tasted as good as it looked. The sole was delicious and melted in my mouth. The texture and flavor were ON POINT!!!! Everyone else at the table had high regards for their food as well. \n\nMy husband's coworker stated that he's never had swordfish before. With this being his first serving of swordfish, he said it was amazing. He's now hooked on it and won't pass it up when it appears on any other menus in the future.\n\nI really appreciate how flexible the staff were at Fog Harbor. I was nervous about showing up with 3 extra people, given that we had to make this reservation so far in advance. Our entire experience was pleasant and I can see why this place is popular with locals and tourists.

We decided to tour Pier 39 first and when we got here we were starving. It was the first place we came across that looked descent so we decided to dine here. The menu looked nice as well as the restaurant itself. We liked that you could view the Bay while eating. We were greeted by the hostess and had no wait. Our waiter was nice and asked us if we had any questions about the menu. Overall the staff was very nice and welcoming.\n\nWe first started with drinks. I ordered the Strawberry-Basil Nojito and he ordered the Maple Old Fashion. My drink was non-alcoholic. It was very good and fizzy and had the perfect blend of strawberry, mint and basil. Nothing was overpowering. Very good. My husband's drink was strong and he enjoyed it. Old Fashions are way to strong for me. \n\nNext we started with appetizers, side salads and bread. We decided to split a Calm Chowder Bread Bowl and we both ordered our own side salad. I ordered a Mix Green Salad and he ordered a Caesar Salad. I'm not a big fan of Clam Chowder but I'm willing to try most things. I honestly don't care for soup but Clam Chowder is just to creamy and weird for me. My husband was more so wanting to try this and being a team player I did. Now our salads were amazing. Yes they were simple but very good. My mixed Green Salad had the standard Balsamic Dressing but this dressing was thicker and a dark orange color. Very tasty. I didn't taste my husband's salad but he did mention that his salad was one of the best Caesars he has had in awhile so I take it that it was good. Lol. He's the one to order all the fattening (don't worry he works out and is skinny) stuff when we go out and I'm the one to make sure we get our greens. We ate all of this with their standard Sourdough Bread. It wasn't anything special, basic Sourdough. \n\nFor our lunch/dinner I ordered the Pacific Sole and he ordered the Lobster Tail. My dinner came with a Spinach and Red Pepper mix with Fingerling Potatoes. My husband's meal came with Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Broccoli. My dish was AMAZING!! The fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The butter sauce was amazing as well and probably one of the better ones I have tasted. I personally don't liked saut\u00e9ed spinach so this part wasn't my favorite. The only cooked spinach I like is creamed spinach. The red peppers added a nice touch to the fish. My only complaint about the dish is that the Potatoes could have used more seasoning or could have been crisped or something. They were just plain and put on the plate. I'm sure they were roasted but there was no crispness about them or flavor at all. My husband liked his Lobster Tail. I didn't try his lobster as I don't like the texture of lobster, but I did try his Mashed Potatoes. They were definitely a lot better than my potatoes and good. \n\nOverall, the Fog Harbor Fish House was a good place to eat.

We were greeted by our waiter who took great care of us throughout dinner. He was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nWe started off our seafood feast by sharing the Red Chili Garlic Shrimp appetizer ($16). It contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce. Although I enjoyed the spicy flavors and tingling heat, I didn't find that it was the best value.  I also couldn't help but try a cup of their award-winning clam chowder ($7), which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. Yum, this is a must!  \n\nFor my entree, I went with a lighter plate, being the Seared Pacific Cod ($28). The fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. It was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. The aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and I loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. With the Cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. Two of my family members ordered the Mixed Grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.

My mouth could barely contain this flavor flurry.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Mixed Grill: grilled salmon, swordfish, and shrimp served with a citrus beurre blanc over garlic mashed potatoes. Had I not eaten so much delicious sourdough bread prior to our food arrival, I would have eaten more of his food too! \n\nDid I mention there's also a beautiful view of the wharf??

I mean, we're in San Francisco, am I right?!\n\nWe ended up at Pier 39 / Fisherman's Wharf not long after our gruelingly mediocre Bartlett Hall experience. We didn't have much in our stomachs by high noon, which meant the immediate need to fill them with grub hit us in full force. \n\nFog Harbor Fish House appeared to be THE SPOT.. mainly because we were right below it.. and our desperate attempts to eat were dwindling down to a either: wait patiently for a hearty meal or begrudgingly snack on munchies along the bay. We laughed at the snack idea and proceeded to head upstairs towards Fog Harbor. The hostess upfront / outside took our names, then informed us it'd be around a 25 minute wait. Within seconds after our groups arrival, the line became that of a Black Friday sale at Best Buy. We were lucky enough to snag a spot in the little patio section by the front bar, fireplace by our sides, and amusingly watched fellow tourists shiver in those chilly northern California temperatures. \n\nAside from the crowd outside, the folks inside seemed mild mannered and less talkative than I'd imagine a spot like Fog Harbor would be. We were sat at nice corner table with easily one of the best views in the house that was accompanied by a pleasant server. And though I couldn't verify this, because our spot was visually stunning.. it seemed most seats within the restaurant gave a decent glimpse of the surrounding Bay and Pier 39. The decor itself was almost on the classy-scale but in far too touristy of a spot to be labeled this. \n\nIt looked like every single table had at least ONE bowl of clam chowder sitting atop them, and because it was on our minds prior to our arrival, it was a dish we'd all be ordering without even looking at the menu. Strategy in mind, we ordered regular bowls of Clam Chowder WITHOUT bread as the bowl.. because, you know, most restaurants provide COMPLIMENTARY BREAD.. so all that excess yeast is simply unnecessary, folks. Unless.. bread is yo' thing. Then do whatcha wanna do, baby. \n\nAlong with the clam chowder (and free bread) I ordered the Mixed Grill Plate - Grilled salmon, swordfish & shrimp covered in a (buttery) citrus buerre blanc served with sides of sauteed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe mixed grill plate was phenomenal. I'm a fan of blackened fish, the taste of the grill and proper seasoning.. and everything on the plate was that exactly. Moist yet partially charred swordfish & succulent salmon had my taste buds tingling and the healthy sized shrimp smothered in butter turned my face into a pure gold. Garlic potatoes were creamy and on poooint. I was shining vividly, and it was obvious to everyone in our presence that I was thoroughly enjoying this section of my meal. (My grunts, smiles, giggles, muffled speech, or if I look drunk without drinking, etc.)\n\nThe clam chowder was, for lack of better terms, doo-doo. Just about every bite had sand in it. Strange.. it appeared there wasn't much clam in my bowl.. which made the sand ordeal a somewhat mind-boggling. Because of this, I didn't enjoy nor finish their 'Award Winning' Clam Chowder. I would've dipped my head into the Pacific if I wanted to taste as much sand as that.\n\nA thin line between a 3 and a 4, Fog Harbor Fish House (through my eyes) may not have the best clam chowder as claimed.. but was boosted in a positive direction due to solid / attentive service, views truly pleasing to the eyes and all of our food (aside from chowder) was tasty and fulfilling for our once empty stomachs.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-11-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, shrimp, and swordfish which was good.

We started with the 1/2 dozen baked oysters, along with the blue cheese wedge salad and a cup of clam chowder. Salad was very good and portion was more than enough, along with the chowder which had a great taste and was served piping hot. However, as for the oysters, they were very tasty and seasoned very well, but they were lukewarm and almost miniature sized. For 18$, I can get a dozen and 1/2 oysters at the grocery store, and twice the size of those in which they were serving. So that was a bit disappointing, especially at a restaurant right on the wharf. \n Our server, I'm not sure of his name, was nice at the beginning and then he virtually disappeared after we received our entrees. I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, shrimp, and swordfish which was good. However, the swordfish was a bit dry, my salmon portion looked like it was supposed to be on a kid's plate, & my shrimp were a little small as well, considering this is a fish house. My friends ordered the swordfish and fried fish combo, which they said was satisfying but nothing to rave about... \n\nFinally, remember I mentioned we were there celebrating a friends birthday. When we first arrived, we notified the server of this not once but TWICE, and he said she would receive a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal. Well at the end of our meal, the dessert never came and neither did he. We sat for almost 30 min after we finished our meals, only to flag our server down who walked by us numerous times, not once asking how anything was. Which sucked because, I work in the food industry myself and love to tip my server more than 20% when receiving great service, but our experience unfortunately lacked the luxury of just that. \n\nPros: Setting, ambiance, and beautiful view of the wharf which is great for tourists who've never visited SF. Also, great cocktails...hibiscus margarita and the lipstick martini were sooo good. \n\nCons: Overpriced, average seafood, and mediocre portions.

I never would have expected such poor service from a restaurant like this, especially one in a prime tourist location. A little background, we had reservations for Sunday at 4:00 PM. Here's a summary of our experience here after being seated:\n\n-No one acknowledged us, no one as in any other waitstaff\n-Another server had to take our order 10 min after being seated. He tells us out waiter didn't know he had the section we were in.\n-Our waiter served a table that was seated after us and still don't stop by our table which was four feet directly across from their table\n-We didn't get water after 20 minutes and that's after asking multiple times \n-Our waiter didn't acknowledge us for over 15 min, didn't say hello or apologize for the wait\n-We had to ask for bread\n-It took 50 min to get our food\n-We had to flag down our waiter to get boxes and the check\n-The general manager didn't even ask how everything was even though it was obvious we weren't happy and were looking all over the place for our waiter throughout our entire time there\n\nI cannot stress how bad this dining experience was. How could a tourist restaurant be so poor in customer service? It should be the exact opposite in my opinion. I will not be returning here and will tell others to not go here. The food was mediocre. We ordered the blue cheese garlic bread, clam chowder bowl, crab roll, and the mixed grill. Nothing memorable besides the food was rather bland especially the mixed grill plate. Don't waste your time and money going here. The view of the water and Alcatraz isn't worth it, trust me, the ambiance isn't worth it.

First, we were seated at a table too small for our party though we made reservations weeks in advance. The sun was glaring on our table and made us uncomfortable, so we ended up changing tables. However, once we changed tables, we ended up with a waitress that was extremely grumpy. Maybe she picked up an extra couple shifts? She was tired and lifeless and was not keen on interacting more with us than possible. There were plenty of servers and waiters around on a Sunday evening when only 30-40% of the restaurant was filled, yet our service was so slow. Our waters were too often completely empty. It was also a birthday as stated during our reservation, but we had to remind the waitress a couple times to get a candle... When the desserts came out, low and behold, candleless... and then the waitress brought out another dessert with a candle 20 minutes later. She then, charged us for the extra dessert and we had to ask her to take it off. Sloppy... and off... \n\nThe food was quite good and well-priced, as usual and the view was nice, though slightly too sunny during sunset (they didnt lower their shades over the offending windows).

We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe food was excellent, and service was stellar throughout. Our waitress was attentive without being a hovering presence, and took care of everything from corkage (it's only $12; you might do well to bring your own bottle) to dessert recommendations (more on this later--holycarp). When we asked for more lemon, she brought a plate of six nicely arranged wedges. \n\nWe started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl, which we shared. It was, as others have noted, creamy, full of clams, and not too salty. Of course you must not only dip the small wedge-shaped bread top, but also eat as much of the bread bowl as you can handle without jeopardizing your ability to put away dessert. \n\nNext came a half-dozen oysters, raw on the half-shell, with cocktail and wasabi sauces. Despite being an aggressively openminded eater, I'd somehow never had oysters before. Without the benefit of further experience, I think it's safe to say this was a good place to start. The oysters tasted very fresh, nice and briny, with a much more pleasant texture than I'd imagined.\n\nFor the entree, I got the special salmon (stuffed with crab) and Em had the mixed grill (salmon, swordfish, and prawns). Again, everything tasted absolutely fresh. All the fish was cooked perfectly--my salmon was just opaque, tender-firm and flaky. The swordfish, which I don't normally like much, was juicy and delicious. If I must pick a gripe, I'd take issue with the mixed vegetables--they were overcooked (to my taste; some of the zucchini strips were completely soggy) and unimaginative, though still a step up from the simply steamed carrot, cauliflower and broccoli you'd find at many common seafood joints. \n\nThe dessert tray offered some interesting selections alongside a couple old standbys. In addition to the expected creme brulee and apple crisp, there was a pumpkin bread pudding, some kind of individually baked chocolate cake, and a pumpkin cheesecake. My girlfriend is currently obsessed with pumpkin to what's likely an unhealthy degree, so we got the cheesecake. Moreover, our waitress said it was to die for. She never lied--eating it was like biting into the spiced flesh of an angel, only sweeter and less sacrilegious.  \n\nTwo appetizers, two entrees, corkage fee and dessert came to just over $100. You can easily pay more for less in the heart of San Francisco's #1 tourist trap. If you're not on a budget, and you want to enjoy some well-prepared seafood with minimal frills and gimmicks, you might give Fog Harbor a try.

Its location on Pier 39 might initially be a turn-off if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and don't relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. However, the food is worth it. Luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. \n\nI would describe the interior of the restaurant as \"modern\". The seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which I think was for walk-ins. Large windows facing the moorings for the Blue & Gold tour boats lets lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables.\n\nThe menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some non-seafood choices. As I understand it, Fog Harbor is part of the Simmons Family Restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around Pier 39. One thing to bear in mind is that this is the more \"proper\" of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result. \n\nYou will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. On both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino (seafood stew), the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. The seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. The main courses I ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. Both dishes were phenomenal.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. Our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which I made a note of on my reservation, and our server (Kayla) gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it!

Do you see the chunk of white on the right of my picture?? That was one of the scallops!! The crabs were already cracked so it was easy to get the meat out. They provide the cracker and a tiny fork but I didn't need it at all. The fish they used was SALMON, my favorite! The tomato soup was DELICIOUS with chunks of tomato in it. $34 for all that? I'd say it was definitely worth it.\n\nI also tried some of my coworker's Lobster Tail, which I was also contemplating but my Cioppino was DEFINITELY the winner. The Lobster Tail was way smaller than I expected, and kinda dry. The melted butter didn't help very much with flavor.\n\nWe wrapped it up with dessert. I thought the way they present dessert was VERY smart. They have all their desserts brought to you on a tray, then they introduce each one. I asked our waiter what he recommends personally and we ended up with two: House-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Strawberry Shortcake. The brulee was good, but the shortcake was better IMO. Super soft shortcake with whipped cream and fruits drowning in syrup. Not SUPER sweet either.\n\nThe only thing I regret now is my coworkers knowing how much I eat...", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-09-14"}, {"excerpts": ["The cioppino is delicious (get the \"lazy\" version)", ", I've had the chowder and crab cakes and a few of the \"seasonal\" dishes.

As Yelp suggests, it is A-Ok.\n\nI took my parents and siblings out to eat and only waited for 10 minutes to get seated. For a Monday afternoon, this place was already busy. Our host led us to our booth overlooking the pier and boy was that a treat. \n\nThe menu was extensive - there was so much to choose from and it really was hard to make a decisions of what to order (Oh, decisions, decisions)\n\nSteamed Clams - A plate of clams with yummy red sauce and corn. It was a little salty for my taste but my parents loved it!\n\nClam Chowder - Cup vs. Bowl - What should you get? Well, my sister and I ordered the cup size, which really is a size of an espresso cup. It was good enough to fill that clam chowder craving. My mom had the bowl. We all concurred that the chowder tasted pretty bland. Our waiter even forgot to give us crackers - whomp! \n\nSalmon - Yes, you've read that right. The plate is called Salmon. My dad enjoyed it and could barely finish it. He gives it 4 stars.\n\nCioppino - Oh what a small name for a mouthful of food.

Its location on Pier 39 might initially be a turn-off if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and don't relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. However, the food is worth it. Luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. \n\nI would describe the interior of the restaurant as \"modern\". The seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which I think was for walk-ins. Large windows facing the moorings for the Blue & Gold tour boats lets lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables.\n\nThe menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some non-seafood choices. As I understand it, Fog Harbor is part of the Simmons Family Restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around Pier 39. One thing to bear in mind is that this is the more \"proper\" of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result. \n\nYou will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. On both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino (seafood stew), the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. The seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. The main courses I ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. Both dishes were phenomenal.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. Our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which I made a note of on my reservation, and our server (Kayla) gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it!

We had the shell platter, cioppinno, calamari and the clam chowder. I have to say none of the dishes disappoint. You could tell the freshness of the preparation, due to the texture and taste. The sauces were exquisite which complemented all of the dishes (the shell platter and the cioppino) but of the two, we found the cioppino the best. Maybe we should have opted for the lobster tail with the platter, but we were full due to the required eating while walking pier 39. To top all of this off, we had an excellent cocktail (made of tequila) and a blondie, which is reminiscent of the pazookie, but with a chocolate nut brownie instead of a cookie, Yum!! The only balance to all this is the damage to your wallet. Depending on your order, it can be on the pricey side.

Upon closer inspection, it's actually very nice. The waiting area outside is a tiled patio with couches, a fireplace, and a painting above the fireplace, so it feels more like a cozy outdoor living room. \nThey take reservations on Opentable, which is probably a good idea for a tourist-heavy location.\nThe menu includes a variety of seafood dishes and quite a few fried items. For a seafood restaurant, there is a good amount of land dishes for those who don't eat seafood. We had a cozy table by the window and enjoyed the waterfront view during dinner.\n\nCrispy Bay Scallops ($13) - panko breaded & fried, w/ roasted jalapeno aioli:\nI was hoping the scallops would have a light crunchy panko crust, but the tiny bite-sized bay scallops were completely coated in breading and unrecognizable as scallops. It was my mistake. I should have guessed panko breaded meant covered in panko. It was too much breading and a little too oily for me to enjoy them as scallops. If I knew they would have that much breading, I wouldn't have ordered this dish. It's not bad for a deep-fried snack. The thick, heavy jalapeno aioli added a little bit of a kick.\n\nShellfish Platter ($38 for 1, $59 for 2) - 1/2 crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, oven roasted w/ butter, garlic, herbs:\nThe shellfish massacre presented in front of us was seasoned nicely and tasted quite fresh. The crab legs were sweet and meaty. The mussels and clams were nice and springy. The shrimp at the bottom of the plate soaked up all the buttery juices and herbs. It also came with some corn on the cob and garlic toast. \n\nBread Pudding ($8.50) - topped w/ vanilla ice cream, vanilla bean sauce, dusted with cocoa powder:\nDinner was a little salty, so I wanted something sweet. I'm fond of bread pudding, so that was an easy choice. It was served warm and gooey and the edges were a little crispy.\n\nWhile we ate, we enjoyed watching the sunset over the water. It made for a nice meal. If I come back, I'd probably try the cioppino next.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I went with the Cioppino (when in San Fran!)

We had no reservations, 6 of us on a Saturday night, they were packed, yet we were seated in half hour--impressive. I was blown away with the ambience inside: cavernous space, floor to ceiling windows, sweeping gorgeous views of the water, picturesque boats docking, sun glistening, charming landscape. We were seated on the more intimate and quiet upper level, white tablecloths banquette. Our server was energetic, warm, sweet, eager to please. Throughout the meal he was engaged and responsive, proactive, came back to check on us several times and was endlessly patient, e.g. my niece and nephew had an attack of paralysis over the dessert :-) The food: holy sweet mother of God, WTF are these people doing in the kitchen? They're rocking the shit out of it, is what. For starters: shellfish platter and caesar salad. The complimentary bread are rolls, mini sourdough dutch crunch bites, but with a dense, toothsome texture.  A basket of these with soft consistency butter. Gluten-free be damned, I scarfed down 2. The caesar is whole romaine leaves, dressed with a tangy anchovy/egg based dressing, a beautiful balance of tart and creamy, simple yet beyond. The shellfish platter is a sight: half crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, fingerling potatoes roasted with butter, garlic, herbs, lemon wedges. The remarkable thing: it's more than the sum of its parts, not disparate items arranged on a platter. Everything is a symphony. The fish screams pristine FRESH ... this is what SF should be and damn if I wasn't proud to be a local. I got the Seared Pacific Cod,  white beans infused with chorizo butter, spinach, topped with garlic  aioli. This dish left all of us agape--it's an ode to hearty flavors of smoky white beans and wilted spinach, tiny bits of tomato, the broth a rich base. Fyi, cod doesn't usually excite me, but because of the freshness and charred seared cooking technique, I'm a convert. My husband had the cioppino: salmon chunks, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels stewed in a tomato seafood broth, which was the perfect consistency, not overly thick and not watery either, with a kick of spice, more like lingering heat than a kick to the palate. Neither my niece and nephew, nor my brother had tried cioppino before, and it was unanimous: they loved it. My brother had their crab meat topped filet mignon with a demi glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach. He likes his meat medium well, and they cooked it within an inch of perfection--melt in your mouth tender, yet done all the way through, flavorful with the crab finishing touch, and again the dish came together like a music riff. My sister in law had their fish and chips, and while she loved the fish, the fries she prefers to be thick and soft, rather than skinny and crunchy, but that's not a cooking thing, it's more of a personal preference. My niece and nephew ordered their lobster mac n cheese, and while it's clearly full of quality ingredients, it was a tad dry and not creamy enough. Did I mention that I had their non-alcoholic ginger beer, soda with a strong ginger punch, pieces of fresh ginger over crushed ice. After our entrees, our server, whose name I wish I'd gotten to applaud him publicly, came over with a dessert tray, and asked me to pick out whatever I wanted. We settled on the chocolate banana bread pudding, made with Boudin's fresh sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate and topped with vanilla bean sauce. I usually hate bread pudding, it's an oxymoron--\"bread\" and \"pudding\" cancels each other out, right? NOT! Bittersweet chocolate, fresh banana, spooned into creamy decadent consistency, delicate vanilla sauce. 6 of us lunging for that plate was not a pretty sight :-)  Our server came over to take out photo and sang happy birthday, all of them so obviously enjoying being there and taking pride in doing their job well--thank you all of you, and I promise when I return, I'll make a point of getting all your names--you deserve a public shout out :-)  Hours later, as we wound down our dinner, it was dark outside and fireworks exploded outside, massive coronas of light, yellow and red in bursts of sunlike spirals ... it was a gift out of nowhere, a spontaneous  celebratory bang and perfect ending to the meal.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Cioppino plus Alcatraz Escape!

We were given some complimentary warm bread and butter, and the restaurant manager started off our meal with a small amuse-bouche since we decided to go with the Restaurant Week menu.

This could definitely feed two people, but I managed to eat pretty much the whole thing by myself because it was just THAT good. I really liked the crab and scallops in the dish - great soft texture. The shrimp was a little chewy and the fish was a little overcooked but still good. The broth was AMAZING.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.\n\nOur table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.\n\nFor the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.\n\nMy friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.\n\nFor entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.\n \nI chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*\n\nAs our desserts, we each ordered something different:\n\nThe VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.\n \nThe MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.\n \nThe CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert.

", "I can say that I will recommend this place to anyone going to the San Francisco area!"], "author": "Lisa D.", "review": "I made a reservation for this place on open table and the day before I noticed that my reservation had been cancelled on open table. I thought that was odd and made another reservation at approximately the same time. The day of my reservation I got a call from the restaurant asking if I really wanted two reservations or was that a mistake. I said I only needed one but my open table reservation had been cancelled and so I made another. The woman on the phone said the original reservation was on their books even though it wasn't on my open table app. As soon as I hung up the phone-my 2nd reservation was cancelled as well! So I ended up not getting the open table 100 points. I just thought that was strange but the experience at the restaurant made up for losing my 100 points. We were seated at a table in the bar area that I chose because it was pretty warm in the restaurant and this area was the coolest place. (I have hot flashes and a cool spot wins over a view any day) Our server Ron C came over and took our drink and appetizer order. I had the Perfect Hibiscus Margarita $12.5 (Voted SF Weekly's Best Margarita) \nEl Charro Reposado, Patron Citronge, hibiscus syrup, fresh lime and agave served up and topped with Patron Citronge foam.\nIt was literally perfect and I very rarely order drinks in a restaurant because I am sooooo picky. I send more drinks back than I drink. \nWe ordered a crab Louis salad as an appetizer and it was HUGE and delicious. We didn't expect it to be as large as it was. House made dressing was the cherry on top of this perfectly made salad. For my entree Ron suggested  the Ahi Tuna $26\nSeared \"RARE\", sesame seed crust, ginger soy glaze, wasabi aioli, stir fried vegetables and garlic jasmine rice. I prefer medium rare so I ordered it that way and it came out perfectly. I keep using that word but I am serious when I say-I am a hard to please diner and this place was just hitting it out of the park. My husband and daughter couldn't believe it. My husband ordered the Cioppino $33\nCrab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels, stewed in a seafood tomato broth, and he was very happy-he called it the best he's ever had.  It was a huge portion and that always makes him happy as well. \nOur 16 year old daughter did not find anything on the menu that she wanted so I encouraged her to order the clam chowder and caesar salad plate. She loves a caesar salad but she did not like the clam chowder. When Ron noticed that she basically hadn't touched it he commiserated with her about living in San Francisco and not liking clam chowder. He took it off the bill even though we told him not to since she had eaten the salad! In the end she ordered the  Blondie Sundae $8.5:\nChocolate chip style brownie square with walnuts, topped with vanilla ice cream, biscoff cookie crumbles and a biscoff sweet spread drizzle. Dessert is always her favorite. Juan the manager came over and asked us how our meal was and we told him how amazing it was and how accommodating our server was. He then told us that he wanted to comp our daughter's dessert because she didn't like her clam chowder. I was shocked. I mean they had already took it off the bill and then gave her a free dessert??? We didn't ask for any of that. I am truly impressed with their commitment to making their diners happy.

It was laying on a bed of wild rice and sauteed vegetables with this light soysauce/teriyaki flavor that just added soo much flavor to the tuna. if you are a tuna fan, you will LOVE IT!!! \n\n3. Fog harbor burger: My first \"sweet\" burger ever. This burger is so juicy and tender (i usually get it medium rare). the caramelized onions add such a bursting flavor into my mouth... and the saltiness of the bacon balances the taste.\n\n4. Prawn ravioli: i usually get this w/CIOPPINO (type of tomato sauce) sauce on top.

The only dish which is really GREAT is seafood ciopino. The shrimps, scallops are very fresh. You can feel its original freshness even with the strong flavor soup. Highly recommended.\nFor Fish n chips, the chips are ok but the fish is obviously overcooked and very very oily. The MOST DISAPPOINTING dish is our MOST PRICEY dish- garlic roasted crab. Once I cracked the shell and trying to take out the meat, from the meat texture, I could tell it's NOT FRESH. My husband verified that since he only tasted the garlic and butter from the crab NOTHING MORE! For me, it's even worse, it's completely tasteless, maybe with a little bit of garlic flavor. But we shouldn't pay $37 for garlic and butter!! We had crab several times before from Nick's Lighthouse food stand. We can tell the difference. Nick's crabs are so fresh and with minimal processing, no garlic no butter, the meat alone is already so tasty. Our conclusion is NEVER get CRAB at FISH House. Even the crab in the seafood cioppino is tasteless. From meat texture to taste, you can definitely tell the crabs are NOT FRESH!\n\nService- we are surprised to have ALL our dishes coming out AT ONCE. I don't know if that's standard practice for seafood restaurant or not. But to us, this is SO WRONG. After we finish fish n chips(the most time sensitive dish), the rest were already cold as ice. Besides that, the service is ok, not very attentive but will do when you ask. \n\nAmbiance- the view is unbeatable, 5 stars.\n\nOther- this's the first time I saw \"SF Emp Ord 4%\" from my bill.we paid anyway. I have no clue what the heck is that. After I google it, I felt like being scammed. Why should I pay for the restaurant employee's health insurance?!That should be the restaurant's responsibility! Does that mean they treat their employees like dirt so customers have to do what they don't to keep their employees live a normal life? They don't pay insurance, customers are obligated to pay for them. They pay waiters poor salary, customers have to pay a large sum to cover it(I DO think tips are necessary for rewarding good service, just don't like it when it become obligation even for poor service) And if that really helps the employees get better health insurance, I feel better with that. But according to Wall Street Journal, mostly are just scammer and go to restaurant. I don't know about this restaurant.\n\nConclusion-It's very unlikely we will return.

The crab was a little disappointing. There wasn't enough garlic flavor. Plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. It was just an empty shell for decoration. If a restaurant states a whole crab, I think that should include the head. The shrimp were okay. Had a nice heat, but I didn't really like the sauce. A little too sweet for me. Dinner came with complimentary Bread & Butter, which was good for soup dipping.\n\nService here was nice and friendly.

As Yelp suggests, it is A-Ok.\n\nI took my parents and siblings out to eat and only waited for 10 minutes to get seated. For a Monday afternoon, this place was already busy. Our host led us to our booth overlooking the pier and boy was that a treat. \n\nThe menu was extensive - there was so much to choose from and it really was hard to make a decisions of what to order (Oh, decisions, decisions)\n\nSteamed Clams - A plate of clams with yummy red sauce and corn. It was a little salty for my taste but my parents loved it!\n\nClam Chowder - Cup vs. Bowl - What should you get? Well, my sister and I ordered the cup size, which really is a size of an espresso cup. It was good enough to fill that clam chowder craving. My mom had the bowl. We all concurred that the chowder tasted pretty bland. Our waiter even forgot to give us crackers - whomp! \n\nSalmon - Yes, you've read that right. The plate is called Salmon. My dad enjoyed it and could barely finish it. He gives it 4 stars.\n\nCioppino - Oh what a small name for a mouthful of food. So there was crab, fish (not sure what kind), shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels, stewed in a seafood tomato broth.\u00a0It was a little salty for my taste  and needed so much water to wash it out. 3 stars\n\nShellfish Platter for two!: Mom and sister had to share this one out.

The garlicky flavor was great and it kept wanting me to eat more and more of it each time. 5 stars.\n\nSurf and Turf: Brother wanted some meat so he settled for this. He demolished his steak and lobster but says his veggies and mash potatoes were gross. 4 stars.\n\nDrinks:\n\nThe  \"Perfect Hibiscus Margarita\" was really perfect.

It was my mistake. I should have guessed panko breaded meant covered in panko. It was too much breading and a little too oily for me to enjoy them as scallops.

At front, they're friendly and really trying to get you in. As we decided to dine here, I requested a table by the window. They said they'd get as as close as possible.

We had no reservations, 6 of us on a Saturday night, they were packed, yet we were seated in half hour--impressive. I was blown away with the ambience inside: cavernous space, floor to ceiling windows, sweeping gorgeous views of the water, picturesque boats docking, sun glistening, charming landscape. We were seated on the more intimate and quiet upper level, white tablecloths banquette. Our server was energetic, warm, sweet, eager to please. Throughout the meal he was engaged and responsive, proactive, came back to check on us several times and was endlessly patient, e.g. my niece and nephew had an attack of paralysis over the dessert :-) The food: holy sweet mother of God, WTF are these people doing in the kitchen? They're rocking the shit out of it, is what. For starters: shellfish platter and caesar salad. The complimentary bread are rolls, mini sourdough dutch crunch bites, but with a dense, toothsome texture.  A basket of these with soft consistency butter. Gluten-free be damned, I scarfed down 2. The caesar is whole romaine leaves, dressed with a tangy anchovy/egg based dressing, a beautiful balance of tart and creamy, simple yet beyond. The shellfish platter is a sight: half crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, fingerling potatoes roasted with butter, garlic, herbs, lemon wedges. The remarkable thing: it's more than the sum of its parts, not disparate items arranged on a platter. Everything is a symphony. The fish screams pristine FRESH ... this is what SF should be and damn if I wasn't proud to be a local. I got the Seared Pacific Cod,  white beans infused with chorizo butter, spinach, topped with garlic  aioli. This dish left all of us agape--it's an ode to hearty flavors of smoky white beans and wilted spinach, tiny bits of tomato, the broth a rich base. Fyi, cod doesn't usually excite me, but because of the freshness and charred seared cooking technique, I'm a convert. My husband had the cioppino: salmon chunks, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels stewed in a tomato seafood broth, which was the perfect consistency, not overly thick and not watery either, with a kick of spice, more like lingering heat than a kick to the palate. Neither my niece and nephew, nor my brother had tried cioppino before, and it was unanimous: they loved it. My brother had their crab meat topped filet mignon with a demi glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach. He likes his meat medium well, and they cooked it within an inch of perfection--melt in your mouth tender, yet done all the way through, flavorful with the crab finishing touch, and again the dish came together like a music riff. My sister in law had their fish and chips, and while she loved the fish, the fries she prefers to be thick and soft, rather than skinny and crunchy, but that's not a cooking thing, it's more of a personal preference. My niece and nephew ordered their lobster mac n cheese, and while it's clearly full of quality ingredients, it was a tad dry and not creamy enough. Did I mention that I had their non-alcoholic ginger beer, soda with a strong ginger punch, pieces of fresh ginger over crushed ice. After our entrees, our server, whose name I wish I'd gotten to applaud him publicly, came over with a dessert tray, and asked me to pick out whatever I wanted. We settled on the chocolate banana bread pudding, made with Boudin's fresh sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate and topped with vanilla bean sauce. I usually hate bread pudding, it's an oxymoron--\"bread\" and \"pudding\" cancels each other out, right? NOT! Bittersweet chocolate, fresh banana, spooned into creamy decadent consistency, delicate vanilla sauce. 6 of us lunging for that plate was not a pretty sight :-)  Our server came over to take out photo and sang happy birthday, all of them so obviously enjoying being there and taking pride in doing their job well--thank you all of you, and I promise when I return, I'll make a point of getting all your names--you deserve a public shout out :-)  Hours later, as we wound down our dinner, it was dark outside and fireworks exploded outside, massive coronas of light, yellow and red in bursts of sunlike spirals ... it was a gift out of nowhere, a spontaneous  celebratory bang and perfect ending to the meal.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-03-25"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend and I each got a clam chowder before splitting the shellfish platter.

We arrived at around 6:30pm to the restaurant and the wait was approximately 2 hours. We were seated at about 8:30 pm last night. Our kids were so pumped up to see the fireworks at the pier so we petition for a table near a window since fireworks were to start at 9:30pm. Our waiter came to get us started with our drinks and then came back to leave them and take our order. We asked a few questions which he was unable to answer. During our dinner he never came by to refill our drinks. Our kids were so excited about the dessert because they saw their Platter with the dessert plates being offerred to other tables. Our waiter never came by with it. Food was okay. My son ordered the chicken tenders with french fries. He is not a fan of french fries but he ate them and only ate one of the chicken tenders. He said they were not good. My daughter had the grilled cheese with french fries and she only took a bite of the grilled cheese and left it there too. We had the cesar salad with the clam chowder soup. It was okay. For our main dish we had the shellfish platter for two. It was not good. Our waiter dissapeared for a long time we wanted to beat the crowd. He finally showed up and we asked for the check I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream to go. The restaurant was beautiful with a nice view of the fireworks but service and food was not good. My husband asked how much I wanted to leave him for tip. I said nothing, I did not like my waiters service. We had better service and food at the in n out a few blocks down. Waiter came to leave our dessert we grabbed our belongings and we walked out the restaurant. He came out the restaurant chasing us that we did not leave him a tip. I felt embarrased, people probably thought we had not payed our bill. My husband felt bad and gave him five dollars. I was upset. When you have good food and good service we do not hesitate to tip our waiter or waitress but this was just rediculous.

It was good but nothing to brag about. Then our appetizers came. The calamari was good, it only comes with tarter sauce though. The mussel fries was really good.

It's probably safe to say my dad's entree, the cheapest was the best, linguine and clams. It came with only 5-6 shelled clams and some canned clams. But he seemed to enjoy it. \n\nI ordered the salmon entree. The fish was cooked perfectly but the flavor was just everywhere. Salmon was sitting on top of potato fingerlings, corn, salsa, red bell peppers (which was sour) and some greens. It was too much going on.

We had no reservations, 6 of us on a Saturday night, they were packed, yet we were seated in half hour--impressive. I was blown away with the ambience inside: cavernous space, floor to ceiling windows, sweeping gorgeous views of the water, picturesque boats docking, sun glistening, charming landscape. We were seated on the more intimate and quiet upper level, white tablecloths banquette. Our server was energetic, warm, sweet, eager to please. Throughout the meal he was engaged and responsive, proactive, came back to check on us several times and was endlessly patient, e.g. my niece and nephew had an attack of paralysis over the dessert :-) The food: holy sweet mother of God, WTF are these people doing in the kitchen? They're rocking the shit out of it, is what. For starters: shellfish platter and caesar salad. The complimentary bread are rolls, mini sourdough dutch crunch bites, but with a dense, toothsome texture.  A basket of these with soft consistency butter. Gluten-free be damned, I scarfed down 2. The caesar is whole romaine leaves, dressed with a tangy anchovy/egg based dressing, a beautiful balance of tart and creamy, simple yet beyond. The shellfish platter is a sight: half crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, fingerling potatoes roasted with butter, garlic, herbs, lemon wedges. The remarkable thing: it's more than the sum of its parts, not disparate items arranged on a platter. Everything is a symphony. The fish screams pristine FRESH ... this is what SF should be and damn if I wasn't proud to be a local. I got the Seared Pacific Cod,  white beans infused with chorizo butter, spinach, topped with garlic  aioli. This dish left all of us agape--it's an ode to hearty flavors of smoky white beans and wilted spinach, tiny bits of tomato, the broth a rich base. Fyi, cod doesn't usually excite me, but because of the freshness and charred seared cooking technique, I'm a convert. My husband had the cioppino: salmon chunks, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels stewed in a tomato seafood broth, which was the perfect consistency, not overly thick and not watery either, with a kick of spice, more like lingering heat than a kick to the palate. Neither my niece and nephew, nor my brother had tried cioppino before, and it was unanimous: they loved it. My brother had their crab meat topped filet mignon with a demi glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach. He likes his meat medium well, and they cooked it within an inch of perfection--melt in your mouth tender, yet done all the way through, flavorful with the crab finishing touch, and again the dish came together like a music riff.

I generally stroll down Pier 39 just because I love the pier/ocean view, and I've always see this restaurant.  Truth be told, I thought it was one of those upscale, dress up like a douche type restaurants.  I was wrong.\n\nI was coming from San Jose, and was planning on having dinner before I go back home.  I was craving for sea food.  You come to San Francisco, you gotta have some sea food if not steak.  Anyways, I was looking for seafood, and found some reviews that shows this place was pretty good.  I didn't know how reservations were, so I had made reservations via Yelp.  When I did it on Yelp, my reservation became at 9:30PM. Meh, lame. \n\nSo we came to Pier 39 walked around a bit, and said screw it.  Let's just ask them how long the wait is.  If it's longer than expected, we've already made reservations anyways.  So we walk up to the restaurant and their layout is quite cozy and warm for those who have to wait.  They have a nice little fireplace that will keep you warm because everyone knows Frisco can get quite cold.  So anyways, I ask the young woman at the podium about the wait time, and suggested I would like a window view.  I didn't expect it to be available considering it's around 6-7ish.  She took me by surprise and said, we are currently cleaning the table right now, and it's window view.  We sat down for like literally 2-3 minutes boom, here comes our waiter--let's go!  Omg, the view was amazing, I mean of course, I'm a sucker for scenery, but damn.  We sat towards the back, window view of the hills and the bridge, to the left was Alcatraz.  Perfect. \n\nOur waiter was Shawn, absolutely amazing.  Very fast pace, generous, and helpful on the suggestions.  My brother thought differently, felt although he could have been more helpful.  So.. Maybe I was more excited on eating than service. Who knows!\n\nOK, food:  Quite expensive if you ask me, but was it worth it? Yes and no.  Some of the items, you can go out to the fish market and get it for cheaper.  But how it was cooked, well.. Stay tuned.\n\n1/2 Oysters:  Mini oysters was what it was really.  The sauce they had made was delicious, I don't remember what it was, but I have pictures. Haha! Foodie!  It was placed over some ice to keep it cool, which everyone should place raw fish over ice, if you don't... Ugh...\n\nCrab Cakes:  Oh my, these were so good.  They were going for $16, only two pieces, which I felt kind of ripped off.  I cannot deny it, they were bomb!  Once in a while, yes worth the $16. Lol, I'm all for cheap eats.\n\nBread Bowl:  Personally, I feel although they were better than Boudins.  I had Boudins down the street where you had to get it via cafeteria style and I am not a fan. This bread bowl was much smaller though, but you could taste the clam chowder better.  Not too much breading either, just enough to distribute.\n\nFog Harbor Burger:  Made was Angus Chuck Patty was quite amazing.  Definitely cooked to perfection without asking.  Medium rare, but not too rare that it made you feel weirded out to eat it.  They got it down as far as burger goes.\n\nFog Harbor 1/2 Lobster/Crab Meat:  Ok... This was quite disappointing.  This was their current specialty on the menu, and I honestly felt like I should have just gotten a full damn lobster tail.  The crab meat was just baked crab.  Nothing special about it.  They charged me a little more than just the lobster tail.  I prefer the lobster tail so much more than to order this again.\n\nFish and Chips:  Fried to a golden texture, very delish.  On point  Not much I can really say, I didn't really eat it.  My boyfriend ordered it. :P Sorry guys\n\n\nOverall my experience was great.

Crab Cakes: crunchy on the outside, so soft and moist on the inside. Its good for the appetizer and for the regular meal as well.\n\n2. Ahi Tuna: a BIG chunk of tuna (Seasoned on the outside of course). It was laying on a bed of wild rice and sauteed vegetables with this light soysauce/teriyaki flavor that just added soo much flavor to the tuna. if you are a tuna fan, you will LOVE IT!!! \n\n3. Fog harbor burger: My first \"sweet\" burger ever. This burger is so juicy and tender (i usually get it medium rare). the caramelized onions add such a bursting flavor into my mouth... and the saltiness of the bacon balances the taste.\n\n4. Prawn ravioli: i usually get this w/CIOPPINO (type of tomato sauce) sauce on top. I've noticed that the raviolis change in size once in a while from small to big-- but no matter what the size is... this dish will forever be my favorite pasta dish at Fog Harbor.\n\n5. Seafood Cioppino: This dish is VERY flavorful. I see alot of tourists trying out this dish but for me personally, i wish i could've just had all the seafoods out of its shell. I didnt even bother eating the crab legs because i didnt have tools to crack them with.. but everything else was easy to eat :) \n\nThe service is fantastic and the hosts are super friendly! :) :) \n\nOh and before i forget--- \nDessert recommendations: Lava cake and tiramisu!!!! I love the creme bruele.. but the caramelized topping can be often too chewy for me.\n\nENJOY! hope this helped!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-11-28"}], "salmon blt": [{"excerpts": ["At famous Pier 39 on the upper deck, it very much delivers on upscale seafood preparation with certain niche offerings (Salmon BLT, anyone?

After driving 2 hours to come to dinner here with my son, I was greeted by the worst hostess ever. The first thing I asked for was a table by the window. It was a slow night, lots of available seating near the massive Windows, I thought to myself, SCORE! Dining with a view tonight. What I got was totally opposite of that! Readers discretion, I did have my toddler with me, who by the way was actually a saint tonight, even though, I thought a slow night, not a lot of stuck up kid hating people, shouldn't be too bad. Well... Too bad so Sad. Here's what happened: So we first get sat in a booth facing the window. The hostess must of not had a lot of experience with children because as she walked off, I had to call her back and ask for a high chair, she looked at me with puzzlement and semi annoyance, and says: \"well you can sit here with a high chair?!\"...DUH!! I could have told her that. So, naturally I think, well they're a couple 2 and 4 tops (tables) in plain site next to the window where we can replace a chair with a high chair, no problem! Think again, she sticks me in the far back of the restaurant, farthest away from the window!! WTF!! By this point, my own enjoyment was out of the question, I have to feed my kid and I'm starving, not worth the fight anymore because this \"hostess\" was obviously discriminatory towards anyone with a kid , and or was just plain clueless about what she was suppose to do. \nFood was ok, had the Salmon BLT, which was cooked well. I was looking forward to desert, but the waitress either got busy or was tired of dealing with a quiet table and just dropped off the check. All the while, I saw her offer Desert to the other tables in her section. Apparently my money is not good enough for this restaurant.  \n\nIf you're looking at this restaurant as a possible place for a great dining experience with excellent service and is family friendly...skip it. Go to the restaurant in the front of the wharf.  Or take a short trip to SCOMA's or Woodhouse fish co. Both are fantastic!

After having a touristy boat ride on the Bay, me and my friend went over to Pier 39 for an early dinner.\n\nDon't be fooled by the novelty of the Pier, Fog Harbor is a nice classic seafood restaurant. Nice big booths with great views of the bay to Golden Gate Bridge.  The place is huge and would be ideal for a Holiday Party, dinner party or event. They have a nice big bar that serves up anything you want, although they have quite a few custom cocktails.\n\nI ordered myself a Bloody Mary, I can appreciate a good bloody mary outside of normal brunching hours, especially if I'm enjoying some seafood.  Since we were going for the full tasting experience, we ordered the: \n\n*Ahi Tuna on a fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli  ~Absolutely delicious. I tried this at the yelp event and had to order it again.\n*Red Chili Garlic Prawns: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ~Spicy and so good, the sauce and peppers had so much flavor, I added a couple spoonfuls to my bloody mary. Yeah, it's THAT good.\n*Garlic Roasted Crab: Roasted 1/2 crab with a garlic herb butter ~At $15.00, I could eat this every night. Served with hot butter, I sat there happily cracking my crab and tasting every bit of that garlicky buttery goodness. If you need a crab fix, I highly recommend this dish. \n*Salmon BLT: Served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. ~ Really great, probably one of the best salmon sandwiches I've had. You know that feeling when you take a bite of someone's sandwich and you want more. If I wasn't so entertained cracking my crab, I'd be all over this sandwich. \n\nWhen they came up with the dessert platter, I didn't know if I could possibly do it...but there was the cr\u00e8me brulee. Just tempting me. It was just as good as expected, creamy with that sugar glazed candy crunch top.  I had my dessert with an Absolute Lemonade cocktail, very refreshing. \n\nI really enjoyed my dinner at Fog Harbor and will definitely come back.

I guess I came out ahead since he paid for my meal, but overall it was not a pleasant experience.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I also really liked the salmon BLT.

I wish I could be more polite, but the truth is that I am disappointed that I wasted an evening here.  Across the dock from Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., we instantly noticed the mistake we had made by coming to this tourist trap area.  Face-palm #1.  \n\nOur server was not unfriendly at all, but I felt rushed from the moment we were seated.  We made a semi-late reservation for a Monday night (Halloween!) and we had hoped that would give us a bit more leisurely pace for our meal.  I like those European style meals that take a couple hours, a few drinks, and heavy sighs of satisfaction at the end.  What we received was more like a calculated and rushed meal you'd expect at a mid-grade chain restaurant.  \n\nWe started with oysters and never received any utensils to dress them with, so we poured the condiments on with reluctance.  Next came salads, which didn't dazzle us, but neither were they intolerable.  I ordered the \"fall special\" of Pumpkin Curry Salmon, face-palm #2. My partner requested the \"Jumbo\" Scallops for his entree. My pumpkin curry salmon tasted more like salmon soaked in PSL at Sbux than curry, but I probably shouldn't have ordered this dish as I don't care much for pumpkin spice, and am rather fond of curry.

BUT!  and this is a major one, the scallops were nothing close to \"jumbo\".  They were quite small, although tasty.  The photo illustrates the size of the scallops in comparison to a dinner fork.  I would probably have a different attitude if the scallops were touted as sustainable and local instead of being labeled jumbo.  \n\nI might have a more sunny outlook on this spot if I could have seen the view it's known for, but we had already lost the sunlight for the day and could only see the nighttime lights.
