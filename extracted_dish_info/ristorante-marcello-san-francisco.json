Marcello's is not part of the Hip San Francisco Restaurant scene, nor does it strive to ever be apart of such a movement. Rather Marcello's is representative of a time when neighborhood establishments where viewed as a place to gather with friends and family for events big and small. A place where people know you, a place to have a formal celebration, or just a rowdy Saturday night with some friends. At Marcello's the atmosphere is always friendly and inviting. \n\nWith all of that being said, not a thing in Marcello's has been updated since the day they opened - including the bus boy. This is not a bad though - it adds to the eclectic ambiance. I also find it ironic at the Italian Establishment that all of the waiters are Irish Immigrants. \n\nThe service is different than one would expect for Bow Tie sporting Irishmen. The waiters and bus boy are a little slow to the draw, but what they lack in speed the make up for in personality and friendliness. You never leave Marcelleo's feeling unappreciated. And furthermore you should not go to Marcello's expecting James Beard Golden Fork Service. \n\nThe food and cocktails at Marcello's are always consistent. I would recommend \"Frank's Salad\" and the \"Veal Marcello\". I would also recommend the full service dinner that comes with soup and pasta. The apps are also a good bet as well. Their wine list is weird, but very reasonably priced. You can get a bottle of Jordan Cab for half the price of anywhere else. \n\nThe other night me and a group of 6 of my friends went in for dinner armed with 5 of our own bottles of wine and purchased another 7.
