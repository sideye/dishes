I decided on the spicy plum jelly, not too sweet, really delicious. Since the toast was warm, the jelly seeped right into every cranny. YUM!\n\nNitro Cold Brew - I like my coffee just plain black and bold, this was right up my alley. The sun was out and it was a bit warm, so the cold brew was refreshing. Great contrast to the sweetness from the spicy plum jelly.\n\nAvocado Toast - Fresh and filling. The avocado was ripened to perfection, not too soft and can stand on its own. The garlic oil and simple sea salt along with the cracked pepper were a perfect addition. This bread was also of a thicker cut. \n\nAmericano - I got mine with a quadruple shot. This did the trick. It was strongggggg\n\nService was quick and helpful. They do have some items that are rotating on their menu, so what may be available one week, may not be the next.

The problem? I'm not a coffee drinker.

It's very small, only about seven or eight stools, but the menu is large. They have every kind of coffee you can think of, hot chocolate, and kombucha, and then a wide array of toasts. While their other customers ordered the healthier options of avocado toasts and such, and they all looked delicious...I came with one toast in mind and was so ready to finally get my hands on the cinnamon sugar toast. \n\nWe ordered just that, with a hot chocolate for me and a standard brewed coffee for the boo. The food comes fast, the drinks even faster. My boyfriend liked the coffee, he said he'd definitely be back during the week since it's so close to our apartment. He also loves that they sell bags of Sightglass coffee, which he loves to buy and bring to work. \n\nThe toast was delicious! Perfect size for one person, next time we will order two rather than sharing. But it was buttery, cinnamon and sugar deliciousness in every bite, I loved it. The butter makes the center a wee bit soggy, but then the sugar kind of melted into it there and I could not complain. \n\nSo why four stars only? The hot chocolate. Of course this place is a coffee shop primarily and so it's understandable that the coffee is the priority. But for non-coffee drinkers like me, hot chocolates have become a go to option when friends wanna hit up a coffee shop. The hot chocolate here was waaaaaay too watered down, you legitimately can barely taste the chocolate. It feels like you're drinking warm chocolate water rather than hot chocolate and that's not a good look. Next time I go I wanna try to kombucha, and mention that they should maybe rework how they make the hot chocolate. \n\nOverall, super cute place with yummy food and good coffee. I think it's a great addition to the neighborhood!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-18"}]}
