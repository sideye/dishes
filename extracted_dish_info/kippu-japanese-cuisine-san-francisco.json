The sushi (not a fan of sushi and I have no idea what was ordered) was good as well. The salad that came with lunch was tasty and the dressing was just right. \n\nToday I had the spicy chicken lunch. The chicken was GOOD! Just spicy enough to have a bite but not to the point where it tasted like burning. Service was great and food came out fast.\n\nPros:\nPrice. It's not a bargain meal but the prices are still really fair. Where else can you get a great meal like this for 6-8 bucks?  \n\nFood. Everything I've had has been great so far!\n\nService.

I didn't have high expectations about the quality based on some of the Yelp feedback I read, and frankly that preconception helped me get through my meal without incident.\n\nI decided on three smaller items off their menu, but to my pleasant surprise, they generously served me a miso soup and salad anyway (photo: http://bit.ly/2z8G2xR). My first item was the $8.50 Chicken Yakitori because I felt like having a couple of skewers of poultry (photo: http://bit.ly/2Kx8QVW). The meat alternated with scallions and red pepper, but the flavor was compromised by the gooey marinade. Better was the $12.50 Hamachi Kama which was yellowtail collar simply grilled with the skin left intact (photo: http://bit.ly/2KDjNVv).\n\nThe simpler, the better. That's why the kama worked for me, but sometimes simple is just too simple. That was the mistake I made with my third choice, the appropriately priced $5 Avocado Roll which was just that, avocado rolled in rice and nori (photo: http://bit.ly/2KN9afH). There wasn't enough flavor to make it interesting. I didn't find anything offensive about Kippu, it just felt interchangeable with any number of J-Town eateries offering the exact same dishes. Maybe that's good enough sometimes.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Japanese fare with the kama the best of the plates I had\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...pretty standard decor for J-Town\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...a bit on the slow side\nTOTAL - 3 stars...kinda nondescript for my taste", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-07-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Bentos come with rice, salad, and miso soup.\n", "4.

However, what was not understandable or acceptable was why she gave us half-full glasses of tap water, while the tables near us had full glasses of water with ice cubes. The waitress did not offer to refill our glasses once we finished the half-full water glasses, so we kept having to repeatedly ask her for more water (which we received in a slow manner).

The food literally made me sick.\n\nMy friend I arrived at 9:20pm, which seemed like plenty of time given that the restaurant allegedly closes at 10:00pm.  With in two seconds of seating we were told to order within the next five minutes because the kitchen was closing.  Ok.  A minute later the waitress was back demanding our order.  It is a large menu and we did not even have time to read it.\n\nThen we ordered.  The waitress talked my friend into ordering two rolls that basically were fried California rolls.  I had not even read half the menu, so I asked the waitress for a recommendation.  At her suggestion, I ordered one roll, something with spicy tuna.  And, of course the waitress pushed me to order more.  Based upon the photos and high price, I thought one roll was sufficient.  But, the waitress insisted otherwise and further pressured that the kitchen was now closed -- it was only 9:22pm.  So, I also ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and croquets. \n\nWell they must have had items pre-made because the next thing we knew they were throwing food on the table and taking it away faster than we could eat it.  The waitress failed toe toon that everything comes with miso soup and salad.  When they both unexpectedly arrived, we officially knew we were swindled into ordering too much food.  \n\nThe spicy tuna hand roll was nothing to write home about and a bit fishy.  The moment I took the last bite the waitress, knowing I had another roll coming, swiped my plate, ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.  Then set down the croquets which were average.  As soon as the croquets cooled they were disgusting and they got cold fast.  \n\nThen the rolls came.  My friend's rolls were average fried and expensive California rolls that were made with fake crab at real crab prices.  She was upset because the waitress clearly pushed her to over order as well and the once the rolls cooled off they were gross.  Again, my roll had fake crab and spicy tuna. It tasted worse than a cheap roll from the grocery store and cost $16.  It was not fresh or worth the price charged.  In fact, I asked for a beer to wash it down and didn't finish it.\n\nThe service was so rude.  They started putting chairs up on tables around us at 9:30pm.  This is inappropriate because the restaurant is open until 10:00pm and, more importantly, there were guests still waiting for food.  We left well before 10:00pm and the lights were off and the staff was walking out too -- seriously change your hours to reflect the restaurants actual closing time.   If the rushed service, bad service, and fact that the restaurant closed before completing its food service wasn't bad enough, our waitress was not friendly and purposely oversold us on food.  Maybe that works with tourists, but we live here and expect a more honest approach.\n\nTo make matters worse, by the time I got home, I was violently ill.  I think it was the fishy tuna.  Let's just say it was a long and unpleasant night of my body physically ejecting what I ate there.  Miserable.  I think it had to be the fishy tuna because my friend did not feel well, but was not violently ill.\n\nMaybe it was an off night for this place, but either way they got me really sick and that is really not ok.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-06-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We were welcome with a bowl of soup and salad and our appetizers of seared tuna and dumplings were on point.

The service was quick, and the prices were very very reasonable, but I just wish the quality stood up on its own. The restaurant itself is very small and interestingly set up.

My goal of this review is for anyone that works there to never provide this kind of experience to other customers.\n\n1. Took close to 20 minutes to get any attention from the two waitresses to take our order. Obviously, this is not the first time anyone has experienced this, but for a restaurant that is less than 300 sq ft it was not acceptable.  I was also ignored twice with clear visual eye contact.  Two other parties had their order taken before mine was; I had a party of 2, the others were of 2 and 4.  \n\n2. After they took my order of 4 dishes - Post Roll, Washington Roll, Unagi Lover, and Ahi Tuna - we waited about 5 minutes for the miso soup which was not an issue.  However, after 30 minutes, the same waitress comes up to ask if we have ordered yet - she was ruffling through her pad to look for my order.  She ends up going back to the cashier to find my order which at that point she tells me it will take 5 minutes to come out.  \n\n3. She tried to compensate by providing edamame which was a nice gesture, however, the edamame was clearly old and had been sitting out in the open for a while.  It was sour (which it should never be), and much too soft like an old banana.  There was no way this can be OK to serve.  \n\n4. The orders started to come in about 5-10 more minutes, all of which was significantly smaller than the picture.  Yes, it will never look identical to the picture, but it just looked like they didn't have enough ingredients to even complete the dish - even the rice on the rolls looked barren.  \n\nI ended up paying about 65 dollars for this meal and it will be the last that I will ever spend there.  My girlfriend and I left hungry and totally dissatisfied with the food and service.  I've had bad restaurant experiences before and I do not have exuberant expectations, but from a customer service / technical support managerial background, this was unacceptable and needs to be improved on all ends.

I didn't have high expectations about the quality based on some of the Yelp feedback I read, and frankly that preconception helped me get through my meal without incident.\n\nI decided on three smaller items off their menu, but to my pleasant surprise, they generously served me a miso soup and salad anyway (photo: http://bit.ly/2z8G2xR). My first item was the $8.50 Chicken Yakitori because I felt like having a couple of skewers of poultry (photo: http://bit.ly/2Kx8QVW). The meat alternated with scallions and red pepper, but the flavor was compromised by the gooey marinade. Better was the $12.50 Hamachi Kama which was yellowtail collar simply grilled with the skin left intact (photo: http://bit.ly/2KDjNVv).\n\nThe simpler, the better. That's why the kama worked for me, but sometimes simple is just too simple. That was the mistake I made with my third choice, the appropriately priced $5 Avocado Roll which was just that, avocado rolled in rice and nori (photo: http://bit.ly/2KN9afH).

Two in our party got dinner bento boxes which were extremely generous in portion size.\n\nWe'd highly recommend this small unassuming restaurant in Japantown!\n--Girl Scout Troop 111, in town for the Golden Gate bridging ceremony during the first weekend of May.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-05-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The waitress failed toe toon that everything comes with miso soup and salad.  "], "author": "Kiki I.", "review": "I had an awful experience here with my friend.  The food literally made me sick.\n\nMy friend I arrived at 9:20pm, which seemed like plenty of time given that the restaurant allegedly closes at 10:00pm.  With in two seconds of seating we were told to order within the next five minutes because the kitchen was closing.  Ok.  A minute later the waitress was back demanding our order.  It is a large menu and we did not even have time to read it.\n\nThen we ordered.  The waitress talked my friend into ordering two rolls that basically were fried California rolls.  I had not even read half the menu, so I asked the waitress for a recommendation.  At her suggestion, I ordered one roll, something with spicy tuna.  And, of course the waitress pushed me to order more.  Based upon the photos and high price, I thought one roll was sufficient.  But, the waitress insisted otherwise and further pressured that the kitchen was now closed -- it was only 9:22pm.  So, I also ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and croquets. \n\nWell they must have had items pre-made because the next thing we knew they were throwing food on the table and taking it away faster than we could eat it.  The waitress failed toe toon that everything comes with miso soup and salad.  When they both unexpectedly arrived, we officially knew we were swindled into ordering too much food.  \n\nThe spicy tuna hand roll was nothing to write home about and a bit fishy.  The moment I took the last bite the waitress, knowing I had another roll coming, swiped my plate, ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.  Then set down the croquets which were average.  As soon as the croquets cooled they were disgusting and they got cold fast.  \n\nThen the rolls came.  My friend's rolls were average fried and expensive California rolls that were made with fake crab at real crab prices.  She was upset because the waitress clearly pushed her to over order as well and the once the rolls cooled off they were gross.  Again, my roll had fake crab and spicy tuna. It tasted worse than a cheap roll from the grocery store and cost $16.  It was not fresh or worth the price charged.  In fact, I asked for a beer to wash it down and didn't finish it.\n\nThe service was so rude.  They started putting chairs up on tables around us at 9:30pm.  This is inappropriate because the restaurant is open until 10:00pm and, more importantly, there were guests still waiting for food.  We left well before 10:00pm and the lights were off and the staff was walking out too -- seriously change your hours to reflect the restaurants actual closing time.   If the rushed service, bad service, and fact that the restaurant closed before completing its food service wasn't bad enough, our waitress was not friendly and purposely oversold us on food.  Maybe that works with tourists, but we live here and expect a more honest approach.\n\nTo make matters worse, by the time I got home, I was violently ill.  I think it was the fishy tuna.  Let's just say it was a long and unpleasant night of my body physically ejecting what I ate there.  Miserable.  I think it had to be the fishy tuna because my friend did not feel well, but was not violently ill.\n\nMaybe it was an off night for this place, but either way they got me really sick and that is really not ok.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-06-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We also received complimentary miso soup and salad, which was nice and tasty as well.

She tried to compensate by providing edamame which was a nice gesture, however, the edamame was clearly old and had been sitting out in the open for a while.  It was sour (which it should never be), and much too soft like an old banana.  There was no way this can be OK to serve.  \n\n4.

We weren't ready yet so we started off with two cokes. Once we were ready, we ordered 3 rolls, an appetizer and some miso soups.

She was the only server and she running around frustrated which I understood cause business started picking up but when she dropped off the mountain roll, I guess she didn't realize that it wasn't the mountain roll to begin with and it took her awhile to come check back with us.

My goal of this review is for anyone that works there to never provide this kind of experience to other customers.\n\n1. Took close to 20 minutes to get any attention from the two waitresses to take our order. Obviously, this is not the first time anyone has experienced this, but for a restaurant that is less than 300 sq ft it was not acceptable.  I was also ignored twice with clear visual eye contact.  Two other parties had their order taken before mine was; I had a party of 2, the others were of 2 and 4.  \n\n2. After they took my order of 4 dishes - Post Roll, Washington Roll, Unagi Lover, and Ahi Tuna - we waited about 5 minutes for the miso soup which was not an issue.  However, after 30 minutes, the same waitress comes up to ask if we have ordered yet - she was ruffling through her pad to look for my order.  She ends up going back to the cashier to find my order which at that point she tells me it will take 5 minutes to come out.  \n\n3. She tried to compensate by providing edamame which was a nice gesture, however, the edamame was clearly old and had been sitting out in the open for a while.  It was sour (which it should never be), and much too soft like an old banana.  There was no way this can be OK to serve.  \n\n4. The orders started to come in about 5-10 more minutes, all of which was significantly smaller than the picture.  Yes, it will never look identical to the picture, but it just looked like they didn't have enough ingredients to even complete the dish - even the rice on the rolls looked barren.  \n\nI ended up paying about 65 dollars for this meal and it will be the last that I will ever spend there.  My girlfriend and I left hungry and totally dissatisfied with the food and service.  I've had bad restaurant experiences before and I do not have exuberant expectations, but from a customer service / technical support managerial background, this was unacceptable and needs to be improved on all ends.

Doesn't hurt that it has a theatrical effect with the actual FLAME which adds a finishing touch to the baked flavors of the neatly aluminum wrapped roll(which they'll peel for you once the flame is out).\n\n2. 22pc sashimi combo - This was my favorite. Of course pricier than sushi rolls, but the meticulous attention to detail and the fresh ingredients used made it my most memorable of my visit.\n\n3. Vege Tempura - Again I'm not a big fan of tempura, but one member of my party wanted to try it so we decided to split it. I ended up grabbing a few pieces of my own and was delightfully surprised! Crisp, vegetables cooked to tenderness, solid tempura that made me craving for more!\n\n4. Service was incredibly attentive, which is expected at a Japanese restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall: If you've made it this far in the review then I'd like to congratulate you :)\n\n\n\n\nKippu is a cute and modern sushi-stop with a twist of traditional charm.

We also received miso soup and salad which are the usual tasting fare but I was happy to receive it in any case. We also got hot and cold sake, the hot sake went down really smooth and the cold sake had these interesting gold flakes in it, but both were good. The staff were quick to remove plates and to refill all of our drinks.

I told the waitress to give my check and inform the older lady (owner?). She does and the lady comes over and just looks kind of surprised and flustered but unapologetic.

Next thing we know, the owner makes sure we ok and a few minutes later, brings us this fancy dish, \"The Flaming Dragon.\" He tries to tell us what we're supposed it to with it...something about smelling and waiting a minute after the flames die out before we open it...but then just tells us he'll be back to help us. IT was this cool looking thing--something long wrapped in foil with flames literally coming from the bottom. So after it's not on fire he comes over and opens it up...it was a super yummy roll with a bunch of fish I can't remember and some of that delicious crab filling.

We first only ordered beers and sake and she immediately said we have to order food to be there. We said we were looking over the menu and she waited at the table for several minutes for an order. She finally went back to her stand and stared at us the entire time thereafter. She was so angry that we finally asked for the bill and left. On our way out she asked us never to return! In addition to the completely uncomfortable experience, the restaurant was overheating and the it smelled like old ware washing throughout the front.

We ordered everything from nigiri, sashimi, hwe dub bap (Korean style sushi bowl) and dessert. Because we knew the owner he surprised us with the flaming dragon roll which comes on out on a plate on fire and even though we tend to not like cooked sushi this roll was delicious, I recommend it to everyone.

While the food was acceptable, the service was not. Our waitress was not very friendly, and seemed as if she wanted to be anywhere but there. We had to ask her for water, which is understandable given California's drought. However, what was not understandable or acceptable was why she gave us half-full glasses of tap water, while the tables near us had full glasses of water with ice cubes. The waitress did not offer to refill our glasses once we finished the half-full water glasses, so we kept having to repeatedly ask her for more water (which we received in a slow manner). My food was okay; I ordered the vegetarian bento box, which came with inari, vegetable tempura, miso soup, salad, and karrokes. The quantity of food I received for the price (around $13) was pretty good, and overall I enjoyed my dinner, with the exception of the inari tofu. It was soggy, hardly breaded and fried at all, and just tasted bad. My boyfriend ordered the dinner bento box special, and the California roll portion of his meal literally came with two pieces. Finally, after sitting and waiting for our check for about 10 minutes after our plates had been cleared, we had to ask the waitress to please bring us our check, which took several more minutes. When she finally arrived at our table, she brought us someone else's check, so we had to go up to the front counter and ask for our proper check. \nWe wanted to try a new restaurant in Japantown that we hadn't been to yet, so we chose this one.
