"], "author": "Debika M.", "review": "A colleague of mine recommended this place to me when I was giving a for-fun presentation at work about Indian food. I talked about how there's so much more to Indian food than chicken tikka masala or curries in general. Dum embodies this statement. There's no curry on the menu!!! There is excellent food though. I'd say the ambience is casual/trendy. Seems a little bit more upscale than most Indian restaurants tbh. \n\nThe menu is simple- chaats (street food, snacky items), sandwiches (with indian meats), kathi rolls (think wrap or burrito made with soft, flaky indian bread and filled with your choice of meat or vegetable), biryani, a salad, and a select few desserts. We always like trying multiple things at new restaurants and Dum also has provisions built-in for that! If you order a sandwich, kathi roll, or biryani, you can get a half order of a chaat for $4 (which is great when boyfriend wants a different chaat from you). Full orders of chaat are in the $7-$10 range. As usual, we got more food than we needed. We got a chicken biryani (the server recommended it and the menu claimed that the SF chronicle called it the best biryani in town- how can you not order that?), a chicken kathi roll, and a half order each of samosa chaat and dahi puri.\n\nFood came out fairly fast. The first chaat to arrive at our table was the dahi puri. This was undoubtedly the best bite of the day. It was quite possibly better than what I've had in most places in India. Everything from yogurt to sauce ratio to the crispiness of the puri was perfect. If you have never had this before-here's how you eat these babies: they are supposed to be one bite each- that means you pick up the entire thing and stuff it in your mouth. I promise you the explosion in your mouth will keep you dancing for a few minutes! Next came the samosa chaat and it was just as authentic as our first chaat. Samosa crushed up into pieces and topped with yellow split peas, chutneys and sev- what's not to love? The kathi roll was very good although not as authentic and quite greasy. The paratha was soft and had a layer of egg on the inside. It had the right amount of subtle sweetness, which I really enjoyed. The inside was absolutely packed with chicken- the chicken wasn'tquite what I picture when I think kathi roll, but it was tasty nonetheless. They recommend two kathi rolls for a meal. I think one kathi roll and one half chaat is more than enough food for lunch. Maybe two kathi rolls for dinner or if you have a really big appetite. The last item to arrive was the Biryani, and unfortunately I was less than thrilled with it. It had the right elements of a good chicken biryani- the white and yellow/orange rice, fried onions on top, nice dark chicken meat, but it was lacking a little bit of salt and just didn't have the right biryani seasonings. It was also topped with cilantro, which sure makes things look pretty but just doesn't belong in biryani. \n\nOverall, this place is a solid 4.5 stars- rounding up to 5 because of their menu- I respect a place that is trying to introduce people to more than chicken tikka masala!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-08-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with the dahi puri--a street food made of semolina puffs filled with a potato/chickpea mixture, tamarind-flavored water, and plenty of yogurt.

The dish was creamy and crunchy, warm and spicy--it was so well spiced and the flavors just danced on your palate! The Chicken 65 sandwich was decent though not all that memorable--just pieces of fried dark meat chicken on a baguette. And finally, the kati roll with ground lamb, peas, and egg was delicious as well, though again not all that special.\n\nOverall, a nice stop for a quick and light lunch.

And the Beer and Wine lists is very good from various local California wineries to San Diego IPA to Indian beers on tap and prices were very good to excellent. \n\nIf you love great Indian food with a twist of California cuisine and not the Indian dishes traditional pink dried out chicken and Nam bread, then DUM is a must do with only $$ very affordable at a great value with large portions to share. \n\nI am happy to share this review of DUM as they are killing it there and everyone should know to come try it and you will be hooked forever.

Even though the kati roll came with onion, lime, and cilantro, it needed a sauce to provide a little more moisture since the chicken wasn't particularly tender. I actually ended up using the mint chutney from my samosa as a spread for the kati roll. Speaking of samosas, these are huge! My favorite part of the meal. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So good! Now, I normally love greens, but the salad didn't really mix together well. The ingredients seemed a little disjointed. Plus, the dressing had no flavor. It just tasted like oil. I did like the arugula in the salad as I put it to my kati roll for an added freshness.\n\nI wish they offered a chicken tikka masala kati roll as I think that would have solved made the chicken seem less dry.

"], "author": "Debika M.", "review": "A colleague of mine recommended this place to me when I was giving a for-fun presentation at work about Indian food. I talked about how there's so much more to Indian food than chicken tikka masala or curries in general. Dum embodies this statement. There's no curry on the menu!!! There is excellent food though. I'd say the ambience is casual/trendy. Seems a little bit more upscale than most Indian restaurants tbh. \n\nThe menu is simple- chaats (street food, snacky items), sandwiches (with indian meats), kathi rolls (think wrap or burrito made with soft, flaky indian bread and filled with your choice of meat or vegetable), biryani, a salad, and a select few desserts. We always like trying multiple things at new restaurants and Dum also has provisions built-in for that! If you order a sandwich, kathi roll, or biryani, you can get a half order of a chaat for $4 (which is great when boyfriend wants a different chaat from you). Full orders of chaat are in the $7-$10 range. As usual, we got more food than we needed. We got a chicken biryani (the server recommended it and the menu claimed that the SF chronicle called it the best biryani in town- how can you not order that?), a chicken kathi roll, and a half order each of samosa chaat and dahi puri.\n\nFood came out fairly fast. The first chaat to arrive at our table was the dahi puri. This was undoubtedly the best bite of the day. It was quite possibly better than what I've had in most places in India. Everything from yogurt to sauce ratio to the crispiness of the puri was perfect. If you have never had this before-here's how you eat these babies: they are supposed to be one bite each- that means you pick up the entire thing and stuff it in your mouth. I promise you the explosion in your mouth will keep you dancing for a few minutes! Next came the samosa chaat and it was just as authentic as our first chaat. Samosa crushed up into pieces and topped with yellow split peas, chutneys and sev- what's not to love? The kathi roll was very good although not as authentic and quite greasy. The paratha was soft and had a layer of egg on the inside. It had the right amount of subtle sweetness, which I really enjoyed. The inside was absolutely packed with chicken- the chicken wasn'tquite what I picture when I think kathi roll, but it was tasty nonetheless. They recommend two kathi rolls for a meal. I think one kathi roll and one half chaat is more than enough food for lunch. Maybe two kathi rolls for dinner or if you have a really big appetite. The last item to arrive was the Biryani, and unfortunately I was less than thrilled with it. It had the right elements of a good chicken biryani- the white and yellow/orange rice, fried onions on top, nice dark chicken meat, but it was lacking a little bit of salt and just didn't have the right biryani seasonings. It was also topped with cilantro, which sure makes things look pretty but just doesn't belong in biryani. \n\nOverall, this place is a solid 4.5 stars- rounding up to 5 because of their menu- I respect a place that is trying to introduce people to more than chicken tikka masala!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-08-28"}, {"excerpts": ["By far, the best dish I tried was the samosa chaat, made of pieces of torn-up samosa in a chickpea mixture.

True to the ultra-trendy feel of San Franciscan restaurants, it features glowy hanging lamp orbs, lots of light wood accents, and an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook up some delights.

One of the waiters had to keep running to the door to let people in. A \"pull\" sign was definitely needed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with the samosas and tandoori fried chicken. There are two samosas to an order and each one was really big, stuffed to almost bursting with soft, fluffy potatoes and peas, and the pastry was perfectly flaky and crispy. Two sauces accompanied the samosas: the traditional green chutney, which was great, and a tamarind sauce. That one was a little fruity, a little bright, and a little savory, and definitely unique. The tandoori chicken was phenomenal: tender pieces of boneless chicken in a tangy, spicy \"BBQ sauce\" with a little zing, but surprisingly it was the broccoli that was especially eye opening. The florets were just crispy enough to add some interesting texture, and something about the broccoli paired especially well with that sauce and we couldn't get enough.\n\nFor the main entrees we went with the chicken biryani, because we'd read that DUM is known for their different biryani dishes, as well as the pork vindaloo and a side of multigrain naan.

Needless to say by this point I was a little annoyed and put off, but I kept smiling and asked that they please bring it out.\n\nThe biryani was cooked well, with fluffy rice and tender pieces of chicken, but I felt, flavor wise, it lacked the complexity and boldness of the tandoori chicken and the tamarind sauce of the samosas and was a little underwhelming. The vindaloo, on the other hand, was spicy and packed a punch of great flavors, with tender chicken and potatoes, though I really wanted more of that delicious sauce. Compared to other Indian restaurants this vindaloo was served with very little sauce. The multigrain naan was unusual but absolutely delicious and had a warm, nutty flavor that I felt paired well with the bright, spicy vindaloo.\n\nFor dessert we went with the roasted rice pudding and kulfi falooda. The rice pudding was wonderful, with what tasted like cinnamon and perhaps a little underlying citrus, and topped with crunchy cashew nut brittle. I thought that was a great juxtaposition of texture. I wasn't a fan of the kulfi falooda, unfortunately. I'd never ordered it before and wanted to try something new, but the ice cream was really hard, which wasn't enjoyable to eat, and the flavors of the cardamom milk and basil seeds just weren't for me.\n\nNeither was the masala Coke, which was a regular Coca-Cola with masala seasoning and lime. While unique and definitely different, the raw seasoning sprinkled and mixed into the Coke was too powerful and potent to enjoy in a drink.\n\nThe wait staff were all extremely attentive and easy to flag down if needed. Aside from the awkward encounter regarding the rice service was smooth and fast and everyone was really friendly. The interior is warm, with dark woods, hanging metal lanterns, cushioned seats, and beautiful tables inlaid with blue subway tile. DUM is just a handful of blocks from the 24th and Mission BART station.\n\nI'm a little on the fence about the value of DUM. The tandoori chicken was the star but for $14 the pieces of chicken were small and accompanied by few pieces of broccoli. The biryani at $15 was slightly underwhelming, but the greatest offender in terms of price was the pork vindaloo. I've received more vindaloo at other Indian restaurants for less money ($16), and while DUM's was tasty it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had and was a bit on the dry side.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back to DUM, but if I was in the area I wouldn't be opposed to coming back.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-04-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the chicken biryani which was tasty and surprisingly spicy.

I talked about how there's so much more to Indian food than chicken tikka masala or curries in general. Dum embodies this statement. There's no curry on the menu!!! There is excellent food though. I'd say the ambience is casual/trendy. Seems a little bit more upscale than most Indian restaurants tbh. \n\nThe menu is simple- chaats (street food, snacky items), sandwiches (with indian meats), kathi rolls (think wrap or burrito made with soft, flaky indian bread and filled with your choice of meat or vegetable), biryani, a salad, and a select few desserts. We always like trying multiple things at new restaurants and Dum also has provisions built-in for that! If you order a sandwich, kathi roll, or biryani, you can get a half order of a chaat for $4 (which is great when boyfriend wants a different chaat from you). Full orders of chaat are in the $7-$10 range. As usual, we got more food than we needed. We got a chicken biryani (the server recommended it and the menu claimed that the SF chronicle called it the best biryani in town- how can you not order that?), a chicken kathi roll, and a half order each of samosa chaat and dahi puri.\n\nFood came out fairly fast. The first chaat to arrive at our table was the dahi puri. This was undoubtedly the best bite of the day. It was quite possibly better than what I've had in most places in India. Everything from yogurt to sauce ratio to the crispiness of the puri was perfect. If you have never had this before-here's how you eat these babies: they are supposed to be one bite each- that means you pick up the entire thing and stuff it in your mouth. I promise you the explosion in your mouth will keep you dancing for a few minutes! Next came the samosa chaat and it was just as authentic as our first chaat. Samosa crushed up into pieces and topped with yellow split peas, chutneys and sev- what's not to love? The kathi roll was very good although not as authentic and quite greasy. The paratha was soft and had a layer of egg on the inside. It had the right amount of subtle sweetness, which I really enjoyed. The inside was absolutely packed with chicken- the chicken wasn'tquite what I picture when I think kathi roll, but it was tasty nonetheless. They recommend two kathi rolls for a meal. I think one kathi roll and one half chaat is more than enough food for lunch. Maybe two kathi rolls for dinner or if you have a really big appetite. The last item to arrive was the Biryani, and unfortunately I was less than thrilled with it. It had the right elements of a good chicken biryani- the white and yellow/orange rice, fried onions on top, nice dark chicken meat, but it was lacking a little bit of salt and just didn't have the right biryani seasonings. It was also topped with cilantro, which sure makes things look pretty but just doesn't belong in biryani. \n\nOverall, this place is a solid 4.5 stars- rounding up to 5 because of their menu- I respect a place that is trying to introduce people to more than chicken tikka masala!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-08-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the shrimp curry (bread came free with) and the chicken biryani (raita came free with).

One of the waiters had to keep running to the door to let people in. A \"pull\" sign was definitely needed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with the samosas and tandoori fried chicken. There are two samosas to an order and each one was really big, stuffed to almost bursting with soft, fluffy potatoes and peas, and the pastry was perfectly flaky and crispy. Two sauces accompanied the samosas: the traditional green chutney, which was great, and a tamarind sauce. That one was a little fruity, a little bright, and a little savory, and definitely unique. The tandoori chicken was phenomenal: tender pieces of boneless chicken in a tangy, spicy \"BBQ sauce\" with a little zing, but surprisingly it was the broccoli that was especially eye opening. The florets were just crispy enough to add some interesting texture, and something about the broccoli paired especially well with that sauce and we couldn't get enough.\n\nFor the main entrees we went with the chicken biryani, because we'd read that DUM is known for their different biryani dishes, as well as the pork vindaloo and a side of multigrain naan. However, we also ordered a small side of basmati saffron rice, and this is where the service, which had been fantastic, got a little weird. The waiter seemed a little confused as to why we wanted a small side of basmati when we were already getting the biryani, and I explained that I wanted it with the vindaloo. I didn't want to mix the distinct flavors of the vindaloo and the biryani, and I'm also a bit of a rice fiend, though I didn't mention that to the waiter. After taking the order back to the kitchen, a second waiter came out and asked us to confirm that we wanted the basmati rice. When the entrees were brought out we didn't get the basmati so I reminded the waiter that we'd ordered it. He hesitated and went back to the kitchen, and one of the previous waiters came to the table and said that he \"stopped us\" from getting the basmati, but if we really still wanted it he would ask the kitchen to serve it. Needless to say by this point I was a little annoyed and put off, but I kept smiling and asked that they please bring it out.\n\nThe biryani was cooked well, with fluffy rice and tender pieces of chicken, but I felt, flavor wise, it lacked the complexity and boldness of the tandoori chicken and the tamarind sauce of the samosas and was a little underwhelming. The vindaloo, on the other hand, was spicy and packed a punch of great flavors, with tender chicken and potatoes, though I really wanted more of that delicious sauce. Compared to other Indian restaurants this vindaloo was served with very little sauce. The multigrain naan was unusual but absolutely delicious and had a warm, nutty flavor that I felt paired well with the bright, spicy vindaloo.\n\nFor dessert we went with the roasted rice pudding and kulfi falooda. The rice pudding was wonderful, with what tasted like cinnamon and perhaps a little underlying citrus, and topped with crunchy cashew nut brittle. I thought that was a great juxtaposition of texture. I wasn't a fan of the kulfi falooda, unfortunately. I'd never ordered it before and wanted to try something new, but the ice cream was really hard, which wasn't enjoyable to eat, and the flavors of the cardamom milk and basil seeds just weren't for me.\n\nNeither was the masala Coke, which was a regular Coca-Cola with masala seasoning and lime.

DUM is just a handful of blocks from the 24th and Mission BART station.\n\nI'm a little on the fence about the value of DUM. The tandoori chicken was the star but for $14 the pieces of chicken were small and accompanied by few pieces of broccoli. The biryani at $15 was slightly underwhelming, but the greatest offender in terms of price was the pork vindaloo. I've received more vindaloo at other Indian restaurants for less money ($16), and while DUM's was tasty it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had and was a bit on the dry side.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back to DUM, but if I was in the area I wouldn't be opposed to coming back.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-04-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Mango lassi was too thick, but masala coke was nice.

That may be due to its genesis from a popular albeit modest food truck at Off the Grid to a brick-and-mortar space that housed the late, lamented Local Mission Eatery on 24th Street,  a more ambitious venture that closed a couple of Decembers ago. Owner Rupam Bhagat has taken advantage of Local's modern decor and wisely kept his menu simple and straightforward. It also appears to have a decidedly Southern twang. Not southern like Kerala, I mean Deep South like something off the interstate in Georgia. For instance, main plates include Tandoori Fried Chicken and Seafood Stew.\n\nTraditionalists need not worry as more recognizably South Asian fare like Paneer Kofta, Vegetable Korma, and Samosas were present and accounted for (photo: http://bit.ly/2CgLZJl). Being somewhat restrictive in my nutritional intake, I zeroed in on the mysterious $13 Vegetarian Bowl of the Day in the Biryani section, so I interrogated the server about it. He simply described it as delicious if you don't eat meat. Sold. I'm not a strict vegetarian but I play one on TV. Wait, wasn't that a commercial for Vicks Formula 44? Anyhow, I've been having more and more veggie and vegan meals just to even my system out. Turned out the server was right, and I have a feeling it was Rupam because he spoke of the food so meticulously and discouraged me from ordering any side dishes as the portion was generous.\n\nWell OK then. He was right, and it was full of goodness starting with the fresh okra, carrots, green beans, and peas down to the seared onion strings, julienned cilantro, and saffron-infused jasmine rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2pQd9lA). It was a Bollywood-style Chipotle veggie burrito bowl amped up with South Asian flair. I did have the temerity to order the $3 side of Paneer cheese, which came cubed and sauced (photo: http://bit.ly/2DtRYrm). It had a luxuriant texture and was probably completely unnecessary to my meal, but it was tasty. There was also a small bowl of chaat with chickpeas that made a lovely accompaniment as well (photo: http://bit.ly/2Dts2fj). By the way, I believe the term DUM refers literally to cooking with steam, but they are quick to point out that it's Mumbai-originated soul food with a twist of California freshness.

The florets were just crispy enough to add some interesting texture, and something about the broccoli paired especially well with that sauce and we couldn't get enough.\n\nFor the main entrees we went with the chicken biryani, because we'd read that DUM is known for their different biryani dishes, as well as the pork vindaloo and a side of multigrain naan. However, we also ordered a small side of basmati saffron rice, and this is where the service, which had been fantastic, got a little weird. The waiter seemed a little confused as to why we wanted a small side of basmati when we were already getting the biryani, and I explained that I wanted it with the vindaloo. I didn't want to mix the distinct flavors of the vindaloo and the biryani, and I'm also a bit of a rice fiend, though I didn't mention that to the waiter. After taking the order back to the kitchen, a second waiter came out and asked us to confirm that we wanted the basmati rice. When the entrees were brought out we didn't get the basmati so I reminded the waiter that we'd ordered it. He hesitated and went back to the kitchen, and one of the previous waiters came to the table and said that he \"stopped us\" from getting the basmati, but if we really still wanted it he would ask the kitchen to serve it. Needless to say by this point I was a little annoyed and put off, but I kept smiling and asked that they please bring it out.\n\nThe biryani was cooked well, with fluffy rice and tender pieces of chicken, but I felt, flavor wise, it lacked the complexity and boldness of the tandoori chicken and the tamarind sauce of the samosas and was a little underwhelming. The vindaloo, on the other hand, was spicy and packed a punch of great flavors, with tender chicken and potatoes, though I really wanted more of that delicious sauce. Compared to other Indian restaurants this vindaloo was served with very little sauce. The multigrain naan was unusual but absolutely delicious and had a warm, nutty flavor that I felt paired well with the bright, spicy vindaloo.\n\nFor dessert we went with the roasted rice pudding and kulfi falooda. The rice pudding was wonderful, with what tasted like cinnamon and perhaps a little underlying citrus, and topped with crunchy cashew nut brittle. I thought that was a great juxtaposition of texture. I wasn't a fan of the kulfi falooda, unfortunately. I'd never ordered it before and wanted to try something new, but the ice cream was really hard, which wasn't enjoyable to eat, and the flavors of the cardamom milk and basil seeds just weren't for me.\n\nNeither was the masala Coke, which was a regular Coca-Cola with masala seasoning and lime.

The tandoori chicken was the star but for $14 the pieces of chicken were small and accompanied by few pieces of broccoli.

One of the waiters had to keep running to the door to let people in. A \"pull\" sign was definitely needed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with the samosas and tandoori fried chicken. There are two samosas to an order and each one was really big, stuffed to almost bursting with soft, fluffy potatoes and peas, and the pastry was perfectly flaky and crispy. Two sauces accompanied the samosas: the traditional green chutney, which was great, and a tamarind sauce. That one was a little fruity, a little bright, and a little savory, and definitely unique. The tandoori chicken was phenomenal: tender pieces of boneless chicken in a tangy, spicy \"BBQ sauce\" with a little zing, but surprisingly it was the broccoli that was especially eye opening. The florets were just crispy enough to add some interesting texture, and something about the broccoli paired especially well with that sauce and we couldn't get enough.\n\nFor the main entrees we went with the chicken biryani, because we'd read that DUM is known for their different biryani dishes, as well as the pork vindaloo and a side of multigrain naan. However, we also ordered a small side of basmati saffron rice, and this is where the service, which had been fantastic, got a little weird. The waiter seemed a little confused as to why we wanted a small side of basmati when we were already getting the biryani, and I explained that I wanted it with the vindaloo. I didn't want to mix the distinct flavors of the vindaloo and the biryani, and I'm also a bit of a rice fiend, though I didn't mention that to the waiter. After taking the order back to the kitchen, a second waiter came out and asked us to confirm that we wanted the basmati rice. When the entrees were brought out we didn't get the basmati so I reminded the waiter that we'd ordered it. He hesitated and went back to the kitchen, and one of the previous waiters came to the table and said that he \"stopped us\" from getting the basmati, but if we really still wanted it he would ask the kitchen to serve it. Needless to say by this point I was a little annoyed and put off, but I kept smiling and asked that they please bring it out.\n\nThe biryani was cooked well, with fluffy rice and tender pieces of chicken, but I felt, flavor wise, it lacked the complexity and boldness of the tandoori chicken and the tamarind sauce of the samosas and was a little underwhelming. The vindaloo, on the other hand, was spicy and packed a punch of great flavors, with tender chicken and potatoes, though I really wanted more of that delicious sauce. Compared to other Indian restaurants this vindaloo was served with very little sauce. The multigrain naan was unusual but absolutely delicious and had a warm, nutty flavor that I felt paired well with the bright, spicy vindaloo.\n\nFor dessert we went with the roasted rice pudding and kulfi falooda. The rice pudding was wonderful, with what tasted like cinnamon and perhaps a little underlying citrus, and topped with crunchy cashew nut brittle. I thought that was a great juxtaposition of texture. I wasn't a fan of the kulfi falooda, unfortunately. I'd never ordered it before and wanted to try something new, but the ice cream was really hard, which wasn't enjoyable to eat, and the flavors of the cardamom milk and basil seeds just weren't for me.\n\nNeither was the masala Coke, which was a regular Coca-Cola with masala seasoning and lime. While unique and definitely different, the raw seasoning sprinkled and mixed into the Coke was too powerful and potent to enjoy in a drink.\n\nThe wait staff were all extremely attentive and easy to flag down if needed. Aside from the awkward encounter regarding the rice service was smooth and fast and everyone was really friendly. The interior is warm, with dark woods, hanging metal lanterns, cushioned seats, and beautiful tables inlaid with blue subway tile. DUM is just a handful of blocks from the 24th and Mission BART station.\n\nI'm a little on the fence about the value of DUM. The tandoori chicken was the star but for $14 the pieces of chicken were small and accompanied by few pieces of broccoli. The biryani at $15 was slightly underwhelming, but the greatest offender in terms of price was the pork vindaloo. I've received more vindaloo at other Indian restaurants for less money ($16), and while DUM's was tasty it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had and was a bit on the dry side.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back to DUM, but if I was in the area I wouldn't be opposed to coming back.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-04-25"}], "chili cheese garlic naan": [], "broccoli cheese paratha": [{"excerpts": ["For ex, one of their bread options was the broccoli cheese paratha, where the bread wasn't stuffed with indian cottage cheese (paneer) but some sort of swiss cheese and tasted average.
