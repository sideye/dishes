We sat and waited for a waiter/menu for about 10 mins. Finally, my bf goes to ask the bartender and he said, \"u have to come to the bar!\" I'm just going to lay it out...he's a douche. It won't kill him to at least acknowledge our presence and let us know that instead of us sitting for 10 dry minutes. \nAnyway...moving along. We order fried fish and chips and bbq ribs.
