As they left, they approached our table, and one woman said to us \"I'm sorry to bother you, but I just wanted to let you know that that was by far the best meal I've had since we've been on holiday, thank you so much for pointing it out.\" \n\nIf that's not enough to sell you, I'll elaborate.\n\nOlea is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. \nHow can I make such a bold claim, you ask?

As you sit, sipping a tastefully recommended glass of wine, you'll notice passersby drawn into the warm glow, peeking over the candlelit windowsills. You'll look over the menu and feel equally impressed and overwhelmed, as everything sounds so good - and I'll tell you, everything really is so good. Allergies aside, you really can't go wrong with a single dish on the menu. It varies with the season, as they only use fresh, high-quality ingredients, so if you're eyeing something but afraid to branch out, just do it; it might not be available next time you're in. \n\nThe pork tenderloin is incredible, and seems to be more of a staple among the rotating, ever-delightful assortment of fresh fish, lamb meatballs, risotto, short rib, white wine mussels, the list goes on. \n\nThe staff are hospitable and attentive, but observant and respectful of the guests' space;\nyou won't feel like you're being rushed to free up your table. The owner is one of the most genuine people I've met in the service industry. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to become regulars at this wonderful spot, and he always greeted us like old friends.

They make it themselves with whatever ingredients are in season!\n\nThe winning dish of the day was their amaaaaazing french toast! They call it custard toast on their menu and that's exactly what feels and tastes like. Because they use challah bread, it just soaks up whatever cream sauce they dip it in. The bread looks dry, but it's so creamy and soft on the inside. There's no overpowering egg taste like traditional french toast and it's just the right sweetness! It's so good that you don't even need to eat it with syrup! The sprinkle of cinnamon sugar around it is enough!

I've tried the one from the Ferry Building farmer's market, which is suppose to be a very good version of the dish, and wasn't impressed. Granted, Olea didn't call it a chilaquiles, but the dish had all the elements -- the scrambled eggs, the sauce (green, in this case) and the fried tortillas. The tortillas were in strips instead of chips and they stayed crunchy until the last bite. The sauce wasn't as sour as the green sauce on the chilaquiles from the Alemany farmer's market and it had small speckles of pork. The eggs were wonderfully soft and runny, just as I ordered. I would definitely get it again.\n\nThe star of the meal, without a doubt, was the French toast. They probably soaked the challah in the custard batter for a while for it to soak up all the goodness. The French toast was so soft and airy, with a mild sweetness, but not soggy. I can still feel the texture of the egg bread. The dusting of cinnamon and sugar mixture is a little crunchy and makes the treat extra special. There was so much reluctance in Orin's eyes when it was time to switch plates, it took everything he had not to run off with the plate to a deep cave somewhere to enjoy it all by his lonesome.

I had the cazuela (hispanic ramekin)-baked eggs covered in warm and spicy tomato sauce, with steamed farro, applewood smoked ham and basil almond pesto.  It definitely hit the spot and continues to be my favorite dish there.  And, did I here Blue Bottle coffee is served there as well in a French press brought to your table?!  Yeah, that's right, this meal was definitely my manna. \n\nI also came back for dinner on a Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't a wait, given how small the place is.  I tried the pan-seared duck breast, which was cooked too perfection.  The meat was tender without being raw; the seasoning was flavorful and contrasted nicely with the duck and japonica rice.  They must have ran out of the asparagus, because my plate came out with oven-roasted brussel sprouts instead, which were a little on the bitter side (unless you properly core brussel sprouts, parboil and then bake with salt and pepper, you're gonna get bitter brussels sprouts....just saying).  My partner had the pollock, which wasn't anything spectacular in my opinion, but tasted fresh and tender.  The orange cornmeal cake we shared for dessert was also good, but nothing that was too out of the ordinary--cornmeal is not quite my cup of tea, but the orange flavor provided a nice contrast and so what you end up noticing is that the cake has a different consistency than if made with purely flour....meh\n\nAs for the service, the waitress and the host are incredibly sweet and will chat you up about anything.  The place is smaller, so be prepared to wait, though they do take reservations (for dinner at least).

It's original, like no other brunch spot I have been to in the city.\n\nI love walking down the steps into this cozy little restaurant.  I would say that it feels like home, but it's so much better decorated than any home I have ever known.  Almost looks like Martha Stewart had a hand in it.  Jack Johnson tunes fill the air (both times I have been there).  This might normally be kind of irritating, but it fits the mood of the place...kinda swanky, but not stuffy.  \n\nAdmittedly, I have only been there for brunch.  They have a very limited menu, but everything that I have eaten is tasty and unique.  Flat omelets, AMAZING french toast, egg bakes...different each time, but always yum.  Get different things and share, so that you don't have to commit.  They have Blue Bottle Coffee, which they bring to your table in a french press.  The server cracked us up (unintentionally) telling us to wait 180 seconds before pressing and pouring the coffee...why not just say a few minutes?!  Anyhow, this is good stuff, apparently $20 a pound, and the difference is noticeable.      \n\nWhat I don't particularly like about Olea is that you get what they give you.  I tried to order wheat toast, and they only had a toast plate (for sharing) with whatever they thought looked good that morning...a composite of challah, sourdough and a darker toast with nuts in it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not exactly what I was hoping for.  And, this is not stated anywhere on the memo, so the first time you go, you inevitably feel like you didn't get the memo.  You have to ask for skim milk, which they will bring you, but not without making you feel like it's a bit of an odd request.  Don't even think about asking for sugar substitute...it's raw sugar cubes or nothing.  I have to remember to bring my own next time.\n\nAs far as value, I have never left feeling ripped off, but the place isn't cheap.  The serving sizes are modest, but they do the trick...this last time I left very satisfied (the french toast is filling).  Brunch menu items are about $12 or $13 bucks, and then add in coffee, toast, french fries (the closest you can get to homefries or hashbrowns) and/or bacon, and it can easily get you up to or above $20 per person.  Typically, this much would buy a decent breakfast, toast and potatoes included, plus coffee AND a mimosa, but you're paying for quality and ambiance.  I suppose I am okay with that.  \n\nThis certainly isn't your every weekend brunch spot, but it's great for a special occasion or for a treat when friends are in town.  OH, and it's a small place, not a lot of tables, SO GET THERE EARLY OR CALL FOR A RESERVATION (only available for groups of 6 or more).  And, keep in mind that they won't seat you without your entire group.  Be prepared to spend some time hanging out on the steps just inside the door drooling over everyone's food or standing on the corner of California and Larkin.  Perhaps because the food comes quickly, tables turn over reasonably fast.  Though, my friend and I did almost have words with a girl who stood up, put on her jacket and purse and then sat back down to slow play the paying of the check.  We were hungry.\n\nThe host said they are very happy with their brunch service, but are struggling a bit more with dinner.

You open the door, descend on several steps and begin to feel like you've entered familiar territory in the form of someone's simple and charming home. On my first visit, I immediately noticed the fresh flowers and plants that tastefully adorn each table and window sill. Next, I noticed the chef (the guy in the yelp picture, HA!) appear in the rustic little kitchen at the left side of the restaurant. I've been here twice for brunch and I especially enjoyed my second visit when my group was seated at the communal table. \n\nI am drawn to this place for brunch because the menu is creative while being contrite (10 items) and they serve blue bottle coffee in a french press.  Like other brunch places in the city, menu items are made from organic ingredients that of local farms. However, Olea has been somewhat more creative with their menu options. The challah custard toast with korintji cinnamon sugar and strawberries (berries vary by season) was heavenly and perhaps the best I've ever had.

On occasion though, serendipitous winds come down from the that cloud that you didn't even see and collide with your intentions to walk through a city with completely aimless intent.  It is encounters like this, coupled with the brush of unexpected fortuity against your shoulder that lead you to places like Olea.\n\nThere I was, watching a confrontation between a cab driver on a cell phone sitting right there on the track refusing to turn left left and a cable car driver (the front man) screaming at him to get the hell out of the way.  I was really enjoying the energy of the skirmish.  It was a showdown in the sun and I had a front row seat.  Then I dropped my book.  I barely had a hold of it to begin with; just pinched between my index finger and thumb.  I turned to pick it up and noticed that the Red Door was no longer the Red Door.  It was new.  It was revamped.  It was, a brand new addition to the corner of California and Larkin.  Forgetting about the cab driver who needs to invest in a blue tooth headset, I walked in.  The layout was new to me - very simple, yet welcoming and clean.  It reminded me of Carmel.  I chose a seat facing the window and ordered a coffee and an omelet with cheese and spinach.  My waitress brought me an empty cup, which I initially thought was strange (that there wasn't any coffee inside the cup) but I opened up to \"you can't kill the rooster\" in \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\".  A few minutes pass and she comes back over with a great big French press carafe and then it all made sense.  \"Let it sit for about a minute before you press down on the handle\", she said.  I obeyed.  Then I poured...  I think this must be the first time that I've ever had French pressed coffee because it was fantastic - I think I'd remember this flavor.  Anyway, I went back to my book and kept trying not to laugh while sitting there alone at my table, but I really couldn't help it.  Sedaris is funny.  A man with a white coat came over and sat himself in a chair at the table next to me.\n\n\"I'm being committed\", I said to myself.\n\n\"We're all out of spinach, my friend.  How about green beans instead?\", he said.\n\n(realizing this was the chef, not a member of the SF mental ward staff) I said, \"hell man, you can use green beans or broccoli - I'm indifferent.  Whatever works best for you.\"  He smiled and tucked away behind the counter to the kitchen.\n\nThe food came out.  Superb!  I've never had green beans in an omelet, but I assure you this will not be the last occasion.\n\nThe sun shone in through the window and the music played on - Flamenco style.  I stayed until a couple came in and sat next to me and ask the blinds be pulled shut...
