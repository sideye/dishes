Orson Wells movie posters, lots of light and color, and just overall a really fun and cool place. \n\nThe menu isn't huge but has a bunch of bagel sandwiches, salads, quiche, Turkish breakfast, and museli. In the evening, they have mezze platters. They also have various coffee drinks, beer, wine, and sangria. \n\nI had their cheese quiche which came with a huge pile of mixed greens that were lightly dressed. It was pretty good though I wish the quiche was a little hotter and the crust more toasted. I also had a cappuccino which I though was alright but lacking the slight sweetness I expect from a very well made cappuccino. Probably would give the food and coffee I had 3 and a half stars.\n\nI still love the shop though and the service was friendly and warm as well. I would definitely come back and look forward to trying more of their menu and also their mezze platters one day.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Will try the Turkish breakfast next time.
