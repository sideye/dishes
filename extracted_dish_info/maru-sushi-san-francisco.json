I should have gone with the half dozen instead of getting just two.  Next time I will.  My server didn't say, but to me it looked they were kumamoto oysters, and they set me back $4.95 which seemed a reasonable price.\n\nThe nigiri combination, $17.95 for 8 pieces, was nicely prepared and everything on the plate looked, smelled, and tasted very fresh and delicious.  When I requested no tuna (I really don't care for it), the sushi chef substituted with a second salmon nigiri and the salmon was outstanding.  Everything from the shrimp to the yellowtail was excellent, but hands down the salmon was my favorite thing on the plate.  It felt like it was melting in my mouth.
