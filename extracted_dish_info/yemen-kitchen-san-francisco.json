Plan A for lunch was unexpectedly closed and this was the closest place within walking distance. Praise the Yelp app!\n\nYemen Kitchen is the epitome of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It's run by one man, who's the owner, chef, and server. It's located in the seedy TL, a bit grimy, seats 8-9 people max, and the wall menu is only in arabic. \n\nI love that - the BEST ethnic places are the menus that I can't read!\n\nDon't worry, they have a laminated menu in English too: https://bit.ly/2Ixaql9. The menu is meat centric with lots of lamb and chicken options but there's also options for vegetarians and vegans. Most items are roasted or stir-fried. Nothing is over $17. Cc's accepted.\n\nI love Middle Eastern food but this was my first time having Yemenese food. This is the second Yemen restaurant in SF...the owner of Yemen Kitchen opened the first Yemen restaurant in SF (called Yemeni Restaurant) in Lower Nob Hill but sold it. \n\nWe started with the Beef Stir Fried w/ hummus ($15): https://bit.ly/2tMjUDr which was excellent! The stir fried beef was tender and robust with spices while the hummus was creamy with a nice chunky texture. This completely blows South Bay's Oren's Hummus' out of the water on any day. \n\nMake sure to order a side of the Tawah Bread ($2): https://bit.ly/2Mq8tsM for sopping up all that bomb ass hummus. The tawah is a Yemeni bread that's like a thick paratha with tons of deliciously crisp layers. \n\nFor our main, we shared the Roasted Lamb w/ potatoes, rice (Lunch - $13, Dinner - $16):  https://bit.ly/2MwlQrA. The roasted lamb shoulder was meaty and tender. While muted in flavor, the accompanying housemade green and red chili sauces were like crack. They were perfectly spicy and tangy which added a nice pop to the dish. The rice...ahhh, basmati rice and nicely spiced stewed potatoes were the ideal accompaniment for a deliciously satisfying Yemenese comfort meal. \n\nThe owner accidentally charged us the dinner price for the entr\u00e9e so he gave us each a complimentary square of Pistachio Baklava: https://bit.ly/2Kvx9TE. It was on point - flaky, sweet, and nicely sticky. \n\nSince it's a one man show and everything is cooked to order, expect to wait about 15 minutes for your meal to be prepared...longer during the lunch and dinner rush (especially with delivery orders via Eat24, UberEats, GrubHub, PostMates, DoorDash). \n\nThe ambiance? There's none...it's tight quarters with 2.5 tables. The food is the focal point. Personally, I think this would be a great first date place...to see if that person can appreciate good food or if they're high maintenance AF.\n\nBourdain was right...\n\nWhile we weren't on vacation, other than being on a 1 hour vacation from work: \"Sometimes the greatest meals on vacations are the ones you find when Plan A falls through.\"", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Tawah is Yemeni bread - multi-layer and very chewy.

We got the beef stir fry with Yemeni bread. Total damage was $13. The beef dish was very generously sized, really flavorful, and was almost all meat. The Yemeni bread reminded me of roti prata - really good too. We both were satisfied after sharing it. If I had eaten it by myself, I'd have probably been stuffed.\n\nThere seems to be a good variety of dishes on the menu.

Ever since, I have been there few times and each time I enjoyed my lunches enormously. The place is clean, the portions are normal size, the food is delicious and the service is very friendly and everything is cooked on the premises fresh from scratch. Did I mention that the dishes are well priced?\n\nI have yet to go through the entire menu, but so far my favorites are Yemeni style beef stir fry and Yemeni bread. This bread is made of minimally processed, unbleached wheat flour that retains all its nutrients as well as its fiber, and is probably the most delicious bread you can find in in entire San Francisco! Go there early for lunch, because this bread is so popular that they run out quickly.\n\nThe restaurant offers lightly sweetened Yemeni tea for free to all its customers and I would recommend that when you dine there, you try their refreshing dessert Arisei too which is very light and enough for two.\n\nThe only downside to this restaurant is its location, as it is located in the sketchy part of Tenderloin.\n\nP.S. Tea is self service. Yemeni custom is to eat with your hands, but at this restaurant the customers are provided with spoons.
