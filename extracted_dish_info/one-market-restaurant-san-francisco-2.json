Granted it's beautifully located near the Ferry Building and is a scene for power lunches (do come dressed to the nines), however, the food is uninspiring. The best parts of my meal were the oysters and dessert. \n\nToday, I came to One Market for lunch at 1 PM after it had been on my list for a while. Luckily, I was able to snag reservations (recommended) 2 hours prior. We were seated in a booth facing the Ferry Building with waterfront views. \n\nD R I N K S \nDOLLAR LUNCH MARTINI: $1 Hendrick's or Stolichnaya Vodka from 11:30 AM - 2 PM (limit 2 per an entr\u00e9e ordered)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=5k_OMwO0zMJWSmCj-XzwCA\nAs a Hendrick's Gin lover, I was dancing in my seat...LITERALLY!

I eat with my eyes first and the way the dish was presented didn't make me want to dive into my plate even though I was starving. Though requested medium rare, only two of the four slices were cooked to order; the other slices were more a medium well. The steak was chewy and not seasoned properly; it was bland to be exact. Very disappointing especially when I've dined at Lark Creek Steak at least 8 times and have always enjoyed my steaks there. \n\n*CHICKPEA FRIES w/ Harissa Aioli - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=YLrZGp_vIpT7g7zi0G59kg\nDusted with cornmeal and then lightly fried, the chickpea fries were lightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

The butterscotch pudding totally redeemed the lackluster steak. It ain't the Jello snack puddings I grew up on as a kid. Seamlessly smooth and velvety rich, the butterscotch pudding had a luxurious sweetness. The Chantilly cream added a nice fluffiness with an extra oomph of creaminess. One of the most decadent, yet light refined desserts. MUST ORDER. \n\nS E R V I C E\nProfessional, attentive, and slightly pretentious (to be expected). Before I saw the dollar lunch martini, I told our waiter I like Hendrick's and he came back with the Aviator (Gin, Maraschino Liqueur, Cr\u00e8me de Violette & Lemon Juice) and it had the perfect balance of alcohol to tang to slight sweetness. Brownie points for a guy who knows how a lady likes her liquor. \n\nFood took awhile to come out so unless you have at least 1.5 hours for lunch, go elsewhere. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nSimple elegance; crisp white lined tables, wooden panel furnishings, and waterfront views.

We arrived 15 minutes later, and the restaurant is way bigger than I had thought! It was also nice as they have curtains at the entrance, to keep the SF wind out of the restaurant. The bar area was nice, and a piano player playing the entire time.\n\nI could see the open kitchen, and people dining around them as well. Very cool. We were seated at the end of the front restaurant, at a slightly odd table (instead of sitting across from each other, my friend was to my left).\n\nThey had the 2 Dine About Town menus, and a special one for the weekend, that looked really good, and at a reasonable price. They also had the Chef's Tasting Menu that looked like a good deal too. However, we went with the Dine About Town 3 course prix-fixe menu, and added the wine pairing for $14. Our server was nice and let us switch out the red wine for a white that would complement our entree. We had a glass of sauvignon blanc in the beginning, which was very crisp and nice. The chardonnay we were given with our entree, was a bit buttery, and we definitley enjoyed the sauvignon blanc better.\n\nWe were brought an amuse bouche, a tiny baked potato with caviar on top. It was delicious and so cute, I almost didn't want to eat it! We then asked for bread, which was freshly brought. They didn't seem to give us a choice though, one pain epi for my friend, an olive sourdough bread for me. And no butter. I asked for butter, and it was brought promptly. I enjoyed the pain epi more, which my friend shared with me, and then our appetizer of chickpea fries was brought (we ordered this on top of the 3 course menu).

A good sized portion, and really, I was way too full at this point, that I could only eat a few bites. It was very tender, although some of the outer parts were dry. A good amount of fat came off the bones too. It was my first time trying farro, and I didn't care too much for it, as healthy as it is. My friend and I agreed that this dish would be complete if there were more vegetables accompanied with the dish. We also both ordered the ricotta cake with blood oranges. It came with honey frozen yogurt on top, and was yummy! We had asked for one in a to go box, as there was no way we would be able to finish both, and since I had noted it was my friend's birthday, they brought it out with a candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate.

And we also wanted to sneak in our monthly gal-bonding lunch before we go on our trips separately.\n\nHeather chose to try the DAT lunch menu. For $17.99, she got a \nFARMER'S SALAD: A simple salad of seasonal greens. Very fresh and generously portioned that we had enough to share between the two of us.\n\nSTEAMED MUSSELS (chili flakes, pesto and grilled bread): Heather loved her dish!

We thought they were deep-fried chickpeas but they were chickpeas that were mashed, formed into sticks then deep fried. They came with aioli type sauce but they were good even without. Light, not greasy and seasoned-well. Best to eat while hot off the fryer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=6dIhJBSL2Z3HH4WQTx3Mjw\n\nSERVICE:\nService was efficient and friendly. We opted for tap water but our server somehow insisted with a bit of pressure for us to try the flavored lemonades. We declined twice and the 3rd time, we just went, \"What the heck. We'll have one each.\" They were refreshing but we just really wanted tap water.\n\nLOWDOWN:\nOne Market's DAT is one of the best DAT we have tried so far. Heather and I have tried quite a few DATs over the last couple of years and somehow we oftentimes thought they were just okay.\n\nAt One Market the DAT dishes were executed well, priced right and generously portioned. \n\nIf I  had an expense account  or loaded with cash I will be ordering the flounder ($22) at One Market 3x  a  week! That's about $66 a week, $264 a month for flounder lunch. I think I would have to stick with my $3.25 Tofu banh mi lunch at Saigon, instead. :(\n\nAnd I also found out after our meal that One Market is a 1 Michelin Star awardee.

The mushrooms that came with my tuna didn't pair well with it at all.\n\nBLEH for the brussels sprouts and the charcuterie plate.  The brussels sprouts were extremely limp and oily (best ones so far are at Anchor & Hope), and the charcuterie plate was pretty sparse and pathetic for being over $14.  Also, the baguette slices they give with it are extremely buttery and greasy, totally not a good fit for the paper-thin, half-ply sheets of cured meats.\n\nWe ended our meal with the butterscotch pudding, which my cousin didn't like but I LOVED.

The good service, attention to detail and upscale American farm-to-table food are still present.\n\nOn this most recent visit, I met up with a couple of friends for happy hour.  Our original spot was a bust (you could have swatted flies in there...it's a Chinese saying as there were NO actual flies in there!) so we took a walk to find a locale that was a bit more lively and One Market was fit the bill perfectly!  They had a decent crowd, good HH menu and reduced prices on a few wines and spirits.  We started off with glasses of prosecco and orders of the sliders, chickpea fries and lettuce cups.  I thought the mini-burgers were a bit dry and the fries were okay but could have been more crisp.  The lettuce cups contained small chunks of pork belly and were pretty tasty.

I ended up with the petrale sole, prepared sous-vide, with shrimp, clams and mussels.  The seafood was very fresh, with the fish light and rather delicate, and the portion size just right to satisfy my hunger.  For dessert we decided to share the chocolate toffee almond crunch cake with vanilla ice cream.  Toffee bar + chocolate cake + ice cream = \"What did you say?  Shhhh!  Don't bother me while I'm eating this.\"  It was quite delicious.  This was listed as one of their \"Singular Sensations\" and was portioned at half the size of their regular desserts.

I've been here before for happy hour and thought it was standard in terms of apps, drinks, and venue, however after dining this past Saturday it went from ZERO to HERO, in my book.  :) \n\nLOCATION: Amazing.  Across from the Ferry Building...  you can stroll along the Embarcadero... you're backdrop is the Bay Bridge.  How can you go wrong?\n\nRESERVATION: I used OpenTable to make reservations for 5.  I included under Note: \"Birthday celebration\".  Not only did I get a reservation confirmation via email that night, I also received a call from One Market a few days after booking to confirm my reservation and also to ask for the name of the celebrant.  Additionally, the night before- they called to let me know of the location and the cost for valet parking.  Wonderful follow up!  They made logistics of the evening easy and smooth.\n\nPARKING:  $10 for dinner valet.  Cheapest in the area.  Its found on Stuart Street.  The valet staff was fabulous!  Friendly, polite!  We were one of the last tables in the restaurant.  The valet attendant even brought my car from the garage, parked it right in front of the restaurant, and brought my keys in to me before leaving.  What a sweetheart!  They made everything so easy and convenient!\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and a gentlemen who seemed to be the manager that evening.  We were seated promptly near the window (which I highly recommend, esp if SF blesses us with a clear night).  \n\nOur waiter was knowledgeable about all the wines, pairings, ingredients, and made wonderful suggestions.  He was a balance between being there when we needed him and also letting us enjoy the night.  \n\nFOOD:  3 of us ordered the \"Market Menu\" which is a 3 course menu.  \nCaliflower Soup- AMAZING!  I read reviews on yelp, and thank you to those who yelped about it because what a well-balanced experience that was--- creamy from the califlower, crunch from the pear & ramps, soft from the scallops.  My second course was the Pan Seared Scallops with mushrooms which was wonderful!  It was a hearty portion, as there were 6-7 scallops on my dish.   I tried the sweet breads which looked just like hushpuppies.  Personally, sweetbreads are not my cup of tea so I can't speak too much about that.  Our table shared an array of sides: White Corn grits (which I am now a believer in), Sauteed Baby Beets (fresh, crunchy, flavorful), Chickpea Fries with Aioli sauce (FABULOUS!), and Sauteed Spinach with Garlic Chips (to die for! esp, if you are a garlic lover like I am).  Out of all of these, I recommend the fries and the spinach!\n\nMy third and final dish was dessert!  Ahhhh (siighh) dessert!  Dessert is the equivalent of the last glance that you give to your love before you leave them after the best weekend getaway.  Its the final hurrah... you're lasting impression.... the cherry on top.  On the \"Market Menu\", it states that you have a choice of the \"Seasonal Desserts\".  They actually allow you to pick from their entire dessert menu.  Be still my heart!  My favorite dessert is Creme Brulee.  Lo & behold--- there it was \"Creme Brulee Duo with petite cookies\".  One mini creme brulee... accompanied by one mini expresso creme brulee.  I'm in heaven.  Rich, creamy, and a substantial crunchy top brulee.  Loved the mini cookie.  There was a mini biscotti as well which had anise in it which I'm not too big of a fan of, but still enjoyed.  Overall, fabulous!!! fabulous!!!\n\nI'm one of those friends that likes share food.  I like to make perfect little amuse bouche's (if you will) of my plate and taste other's dishes too.  So here's what else I tasted: On the Weekly Beast, I had the lamb tongue with fingerlings.  I was COMPLETELY APPREHENSIVE at first, but was surprised at how darn tasty it was.  Eating such a delicacy is definitely a mind over matter battle.  The bacon wrapped pork sat on a bed of apples.  Moist and succulent!  Butterscotch pudding- heavenly.  I don't even like butterscotch, and I loved it.  It was thick, rich, and bursting with flavor although not bum-rushing your taste buds leaving you over-whelmed.  I also tasted a seasonal dessert of carmelized bananas accompanied by a chocolate tart and house-made vanilla bean ice cream.  Oh my tasty!  \n\nI'm coming back!  Everything was delicious.  Beautifully presented.  Staff and service - well orchestrated.  We dined for over 3 hours and I enjoyed the entire experience.  \n\nI also thought it was interesting to see a diversity in patronage.  Date nights, families, couple with a behaved child, business dinners, and we were a table of 5 (ages ranging from 28-60's).  All of us truly enjoyed the evening.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-01-11"}, {"excerpts": ["The sides we chose were the greens and the chickpea fries.

That being said, the price and the overly-high expectation kept this from being five-stars as it is actually a great place to dine otherwise. \n\nThey have wonderful service and are very accommodating to whatever request, birthday or seating. Our most recent table had crab cakes and calamari to share. Both were very well done, especially the crab cakes. I have heard and agree with the suggestion that these are must haves. I split the daily roasted chicken with a friend; they suggest we order well-ahead, so we put in our request before the rest of the table ordered. The chicken was cooked very well and I disagree with other reviewers that it is too raw. Though slightly pink, it was exceptionally juicy and very well and appropriately seasoned. I have no complaints here. The sides we chose were the greens and the chickpea fries. Both were wonderful sides and would be enough to order by themselves. (The chicken comes with two side choices.) For dessert we split the three-plate mini-sampler. We ordered two and tried each of the six options. This was fantastic. Although nothing was particularly good, I attribute that to the well-rounded quality; nothing lacked. The others at our table had scallops and duck and they all commented on the good quality of their food. \n\nThe current chef often sends out complimentary mini-appetizers which went over well. (The day we went most recently, they offered salmon roe.)\n\nI really enjoyed the experience here. The only drawback is, very understandably, the price and the somewhat stuck-up atmosphere which is through no fault of the waiters.

At this point it's not a place I would choose to go for anything more than drinks and chickpea fries.  Sad, but true.  I've had lunch here several times, for business mostly, a couple times just because, and once for SF's Dine About Town.\n\nOne Market sadly disappoints me.  I want to love it, but I simply do not.  I suppose that is why I've given them chance after chance after chance, with no luck.  I still feel disappointed when I leave, and that isn't what I should be feeling when I leave such an establishment.  The space is beautiful, and full of grandeur, but that is about it.  For instance, my experience a while back for Dine About Town was a three course lunch midweek.  We had an 11:30 reservation.  Got there a couple minutes early, and was seated promptly at 11:30.  We were one of the first tables seated for their lunch service, and placed our order quickly.  We received bread, and a delicious iced tea infused with peach and served alongside a peach puree for extra sweetening.  The first course came out quickly, the spring mixed green salad.  It was fresh and perfectly dressed, we enjoyed this quite a bit... then we waited for our second course... we waited... we waited... we waited... by this time 45 minutes had passed since we placed our order.  Our second course arrived finally at 12:20, and I mentioned to our waiter, please add two orders of chick pea fries to go to have ready at the end of the meal, please place the order now as we're on a time crunch.  He made a snarky remark, \"Well this IS a three course meal you know, it takes time.  You should really mention these things when you place your order.\"  I realize a three course meal takes a little time, but we had waited over 25 minutes after we finished our first course, with no second course in sight.  This, for lunch in the Financial District is a bit excessive, three course meal or otherwise.  I admit, I should have mentioned our time limitations in the beginning since we had meetings to get to.  I just didn't appreciate the snarkiness of our waiter, and I typically don't mind brash sarcasm, and a little attitude since I tend to be a snarky sarcastic being myself, but this was ridiculous.  All in all, the food was fine.  Nothing was outstanding, nor memorable.  \n\nThis was me giving them another chance because I had thought my prior experiences were just flukes.  I must say, this isn't a fluke, and I wont be returning unless it is for business and someone else is paying, or drinks and apps in the bar area.  I should mention my prior lunch experience here about 10 months ago.  They tried to serve me a raw grilled chicken sandwich... twice.  And explained it away by telling me the sandwich was made of dark meat.  Um, I love dark meat, but I do not love raw dark meat chicken.  I don't know any restaurant that serves up raw chicken... and twice... they seared my meat again from the original sandwich and placed it on the same bread I sent it back on.  (I had cut my sandwich in half and that is when I noticed it was raw)  That said, I sent it back, it came back raw still and on the bread I had cut in half with all the raw chicken juices still on it.  CAN WE SAY SALMONELLA???  The floor manager came by and gave me the dark meat excuse then offered me a different sandwich.  Then she explained to me the tuna sandwich is seared, so it will arrive raw.  HELLO!!!  Tuna can be served seared and raw in the middle, I love raw tuna, sashimi, etc.  I DO NOT like raw chicken, and don't know anyone who does.  Food poisoning people, food poisoning... hasn't any of the staff heard of what happens when you eat raw chicken???  Anyway.  As I said before, I will likely return for business as so many people like to go there for meetings, etc.  This will never be my first choice with so many other great options around.  Although, there's a good possibility I will be back for their delicious martinis and chick pea fries... but that's it.  2 stars for the consistently disappointing dining experience and food, 4 stars for the bar area and chick pea fries.

Our server was back after a couple of minutes and started to push us to get drinks. Suggestions are fine but she was really pushy. Most of us did not want to do drinks as we had to get back to work so we settled on moktails instead. Even here she would not let up and started pushing people who got the Arnold Palmer to get the mint version instead. One of the weak among us succumbed, but I got a mocktail ($5) whose name I do not recollect.\n\nAfter the drinks, our server made it her mission in life to get us to order appetizers. She tried to push some off menu crab cakes. By now most people in the group had sensed that this was not a normal server but one on a mission. A mission to ensure an order - drinks, appetizers, salad, mains, desert which frankly we did not want. We told her clearly that we did not want appetizers and sent her on her way. However she had not received the memo about this being a business meeting so she kept interrupting us and it made having a conversation really tough. When she was back to take the order for our mains she tried to palm the daily special on us. Again none of us wanted that. I decided to get the Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak ($24) and made the mistake of asking her if this could be pared with a salad. The only thing I heard from her response was that I could get either a Caesars salad or a grain based salad. As I am not a fan of just eating overpriced lettuce, I asked her what type of grain is present in the grain salad. I figured this is downtown so they may have a fancy couscous or chickpea salad. On hearing this she actually poked fun at me and finally someone interpreted that she was saying green salad. I decided to get that, I don't know if it was charged as a side or a main, but considering the fancy nature of this place I feel it would most probably be full priced.\n\nThe food did take some time to come out, but it was nice as it did give us some time to catch up on the main agenda for the meeting. When the food arrived, the gentlemen sitting directly opposite me was shocked that he got a burger when he had actually ordered the flat iron steak like me. The only difference was that he wanted it medium and I wanted it medium rare. This meant that we had to deal with the pushy server again. He joked that as I had got my correct order he should start speaking in an Indian accent as his straight forward mid-western accent was not good enough in San Francisco. I feel you brother. I go through this every day. Each time that I order, I don't know if I will get what I've asked for or a random dish that the server feels that I asked for. So welcome to the problem faced by the other 50%. Anyway the server got him his replacement, but not without taking her shot - \"Wouldn't everyone be happy if they got their food so quick?\" Seriously? This was one of the worst servers that I have dealt with. She made this entire dining experience really bad. She personified the stereotype. One that has no concept of service, is only interested in pushing a lot of crap on you so that it increases the bill and hence her tip.\n\nAnyway let's come to the food. The mock-tail was really bad. Its description mentioned that it would have ginger so I was expecting a little ginger but what a got was a drink with a huge amount of chopped ginger. Each sip resulted in a couple of pieces that had to be spat out. Just gross. The flat iron steak was average at best. It wasn't the best piece of meat (which was expected) but it just did not come together well with the mashed potatoes and jus. The green salad was pretty good. Its dressing was like an oil vinaigrette which was nicely tossed into the salad. Everything considered this was like a below average meal. A colleagues who got the Mushroom Stroganoff ($25) reported that the pasta was soft and mushy and over sauced. Goes without saying that he did not like what he ate. The colleague who got the mint version of the Arnold Palmer reported that he should have stuck to the plain version.\n\nPrice wise it was in line with what you would pay in any other formal dining setup (Entrees around $25). The food was mediocre at best. The service was just plain horrible. Overall, forget about being impressed this was a depressing dining experience. We barely managed to get our business discussed with all the drama with our server, while eating overpriced average food.

I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to service.  SF restaurants are pricey.  My expectations of good service have increased in tandem with today's restaurant prices. I can't say enough about the service.  Our waiter, I believe his name was Ilsandro (hope I got this right?), was outstanding. He had a very pleasant demeanor, he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and he was so friendly and easy to communicate with.  In fact, the next time I return, I would ask to be sat in his section he was that good.  One thing in particular that I appreciated was that he told us while reviewing the menu and specials, that they were out of the house-made Pappardelle with rock shrimp and lobster sauce.  A pet peeve of mine is when a food server does NOT inform you of the dishes they are out of until you're about to order.  Tell the customer what you're out of in ADVANCE-at the time you present the menu-not at the time you're ready to order and have your heart set on a particular menu item. Thank you Ilsandro!\n\nLastly, Ambiance. One of the many reasons I enjoy One Market so much (aside from the food) is the ambiance-big, sky-high ceilings so the acoustics are good.  You can actually have a conversation and hear the other person talking.  There is some privacy between tables.\n\nAll in all, the quality food, excellent service and soothing ambiance are what lead me to give it a 5-star rating.

It's ten times more amazing at Colibri's!!!) \n\nThe only worthwhile part of my luncheon, other than the company, was their delicious fresh mint lemonade that was like a slushy and their delicious seasonal sorbet dessert plate made with local fruits from the Embarcadero Farmer's Market our waitress recommended....heavenly flavors!", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-07-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Their beet carpaccio is something!

We were running a little late, but the reservationist was very understanding.  We actually found street parking on Stuart, too (Friday night), though there's a garage available for the building.\n\nI love the large open windows with the view of the bridge, ferry building, and bay.  The bread is warm and crusty and one of the best I've had in a while.  The amuse bouche of duck liver was way too organ-tasting for me, unfortunately.\n\nMy boyfriend got the deluxe dine about town menu with wine pairings (additional $15), which was a good deal.  The interesting white blend is usually $13 per glass, and the pinot noir is in the $10-12 range, too.  The pinot noir was very smooth, and the pours were very generous.  \n\nHe started with the asparagus soup with an organic poached egg.  The soup itself, poured tableside, was very green and tasted very pure and clean, but the egg, parmesan, and pancetta added much more dimension to it, enhancing the flavors a lot.  He then had the duck breast with duck confit, which is the least gamey tasting duck I've ever had.  The duck itself was cooked perfectly tender and not too fatty.  For once, it was not combined with a cherry sauce like most places do - instead, it was paired with a coffee flavored puree and huckleberries, which I enjoyed a lot. It was refreshing to have a novel preparation of the duck. \n\nI started with the beet carpaccio, which was a gorgeous deep red color, looking almost like a beef carpaccio.  It came with a tangy vinaigrette but wasn't overdressed, and there was mild goat cheese scattered with some micro greens, corn flakes, and thinly sliced radish.  This is one of the most innovative beet dishes I've had, and it's up there among my favorites, along with the beet layer cake from Spago.\n\nI went with another appetizer for my main - the crab salad.  The crab meat was very generous, with claw meet scattered with grapefruit segments around the plate and also a mound of shredded meat in the center underneath a cooling olive oil sorbet.  The sorbet was a nice, smooth, temperature contrast, but it didn't taste much like olive oil.  The crab was fresh and sweet and not masked by the gelatin like dressing that it sat in.  It was a pretty cool preparation, once again.. not the typical crab salad in a martini glass.\n\nFor dessert, we had the valrhona chocolate souffle cake, which was light, very chocolatey, and not overly sweet.  The whipped mascarpone on top was light, and the milk chocolate ice cream was smooth.  I'm not a big fan of raspberries with chocolate, but the raspberry wasn't overdone.  It was perfect paired with strong coffee.\n\nService wasn't bad, except when they forget to tell us which wine we received with the 1st course.  It was a busy night, but dishes came out and were cleared at a good pace.  One thing that I really appreciated about the service was that the waiter made sure I knew the 18% gratuity had already been included, which I've never had anyone else do.  \n\nI love the younger crowd, the more casual yet classy ambiance, the unpretentiousness, and the innovative takes on more traditional dishes.

All in all, a solid dish, but I was bored with it.\n\nSpring Vegetable Salad with banyuls vinaigrette - This was very good. Asparagus, fennel root, fava beans, and other yummy stuff. All green and gorgeous. Very nice dish.\n\nLightly Smoked Tasmanian Sea Trout \"Mi Cuit\" with potato rosti, quail egg, and warm pancetta vinaigrette - This dish was incredible. My boyfriend hates most fish because it's just too fishy, but even he loved the trout. It was so lightly smoked (but fully cooked) that it looked raw and tasted perfect. The egg was a nice addition, and the warm pancetta sauce was incredible. It also played up the light smoke taste quite nicely.\n\nSeared Day Boat Scallops with gnocchi, fava beans, hon shemiji mushrooms, and a carrot-cardamom emulsion - The dish is great, the scallops, not so much. I love scallops, but I felt these were overcooked. The gnocchi with the carrot-cardamom emulsion were fabulous, though, and I would have loved the dish had it not even included the scallops.\n\nLiberty Farms Duck Breast with duck leg confit, rhubarb, sweet potato-vanilla bean puree, and five spice jus - BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD. No kidding. Best. This was absolutely incredible. Everything about it. YUM-O.\n\nAlmondwood-Grilled New York Steak, parsley root puree, green peppercorn sauce - Very good classic dish. Nothing innovative, but that's not necessary. Not a WOW dish, just a very nice course.\n\nThe dessert sampler included banana pudding, butterscotch pudding, a mint chocolate ice cream sandwich, two kinds of creme brulee, a toffee-chocolate cake, a lemon pie-type dessert, and an assortment of cookies. The only things that stand out to me are the lemon thing and the butterscotch pudding, which were very very good, and the toffee cake, which just didn't play up to everything else and kinda got lost in the midst of other desserts.\n\nI was a little surprised that we didn't get any kind of cheese course, and there were no take away goodies. Sitting at a chef's table, I really expected that. \n\nBeyond the food, the experience was incredibly special. First of all, the chef's table is totally affordable! The meal above, eaten in the kitchen, with a private tour of the restaurant, the kitchens, the wine cellar, and constant conversations with the chef and the sommelier, PLUS the wine pairing with each dish, PLUS two of us got to help make the desserts - $165 per person, including tip and tax. INSANELY affordable for the experience. I strongly recommend that if you're planning on eating here anyway, you go for it and do it right.\n\nBonus points for the following:\nChef Mark was extremely cool and we had fun talking with him.\nWe REALLY loved one bottle of wine, so they let us finish the bottle.\nMelanie the sommelier entertained our crazy questions and seemed to really enjoy making the wine pairings as she went along.\nService was excellent, of course.\nThe happy hour in the bar before dinner was also very affordable, with GREAT drinks. Try the pomerita for $5!\n\nI'll definitely go back.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-03-20"}, {"excerpts": ["For the main course I ordered the Roasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast\nand duck leg confit with saffron, anson mills polenta, and cocoa reduction.

Seventeen years later it's still going strong with a Michelin star under its toque. I'd been a few years ago and left unimpressed but with its bloodlines I felt a second look at the was in order...especially since I dine several times a year at Lark Creek Steak.\n\nA Tuesday night gave us a little breathing room to get a good table. After a Belvedere martini at the bar we were shown our table. Not too crowded at 6:30 (almost unconscionably early for dinner for me), the service was almost as attentive as I might have expected. The waitstaff was fine and everything was well delivered though perhaps a bit impersonally. We ordered right away.\n\nI started with Geoduck Clam \"Chowder\" with herbed cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, celery, and house-cured pancetta. As you often see at good restaurants, the ingredients are offered the broth of the soup at the table giving the diner a chance to see the ingredients before mixing while keeping them from being overcooked. It worked well. The clams were fresh and tasted like clams. They kept their texture and weren't rubbery as when they're overcooked. The dish was very good. Perhaps a bit less cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche might have kept the dish a bit hotter but it was creamy and good. \n\nFor the main course I ordered the Roasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast\nand duck leg confit with saffron, anson mills polenta, and cocoa reduction.  The breast was particularly fatty which meant lots of flavor but the ratio of fat to meat meant a less than satisfying entree. The confit and accompanying polenta were very good. A 2007 Freeman Pinot was good.\n\nDessert was Bradley's Butterscotch Pudding with Chantilly cream, and a pecan wedding cookie. It was lovely though perhaps a bit small in portion size.\n\nI should mention that I ordered the three-course Market Menu. At $39 it was really quite a good value.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal but it all felt a bit perfunctory.  The value was good.

We arrived Saturday at 8pm and the restaurant was full of diners.   We were waiting for one of our friends, so we decided to grab a drink at the bar first.  The drinks were pretty standard in terms of cost and taste.  \n\nI would say that most of the diners were probably around their 40s and up.  The atmosphere wasn't overly stuffy which was nice, we could still talk/laugh without feeling like we were creating too much commotion.  When we were seated our waitress asked if we were celebrating something.  We told her it was our friend's 30th bday, so I was sure there would be a nice dessert given to her after our meal.   The waitress was very nice and patient considering we had multiple questions regarding the menu.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nBradley's Caesar Salad ($9.75)- The caesar was pretty standard with an average-sized portion.  I didn't feel like it was worth $10 though.\n\nHen special (not sure price)- It looked delicious and tender.  Some of my friends liked it.  When I tasted it, it was TOO moist.  Is that possible you ask?  Yes.  There was no texture and it was basically...wet meat.  Gross.   \n\nPotato-crusted Petrale Sole ($26.50)- The fish was just okay to me.  The artichoke barigoule and basil broth were very unappealing to me.  It didn't complement the fish at all.\n\nRoasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast ($29.50)- I didn't try this dish but my friend said it was good.\n\nBacon-wrapped Pork Tenderloin ($26.75)- Pork wrapped in bacon.  Do I even need to say more?   Haha.  Well, in my opinion, it was the best dish that was ordered.\n\nSides ($7.75 each):\nOverview- the portions are TINY and not worth the price.  For $7.75, I expect the portion to be big and darn tasty.  I could get a delicious bacon cheeseburger w fries at Slider's in SJ for that price!!!  \n\nGrilled Asparagus-  wow, totally....overcooked.  Limp with no flavor. Disappointing.  \nSauteed Spinach- Spinach w garlic.  Nothing outstanding.\nButtery Mashed Potatoes-  My friend described this perfectly, saying they tasted exactly like those instant boxed Potato Buds.  Yep.  Potato buds with a cup of butter.\n\nAfter our meal we were given dessert menus.  Everyone was stuffed so I just whispered to the waitress, \"Does she get a birthday dessert?\"  She replied with, \"I don't understand.\"  Hmm...  So my friend repeats my question and then the waitress finally says no, they don't offer that.\n\nUhh...what?  That's lame in my opinion.  Lame enough for me to subtract a star.\n\nOn their website, they show that they have a 1 star rating according to the Michelin guide.  I had no idea this guide existed, so I decided to check it out online.  Their rating system: 1 star- very good restaurant, 2 star- excellent cooking, 3 star- exceptional cooking.  Apparently this guide is well-known in Europe.  I thought Michelin made tires?  I'm confused.  They even have the same marshmallow looking dude on the guide.  Here's some info if you are interested:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide\n\nI took a look at what else is in their SF 1 star category.  Wow.  Gary Danko?!  Chez Panisse?!   One Market is NOT is the same category of these great restaurants at ALL.  They list Aqua and Michael Mina in the 2 stars.  They have only one restaurant with 3 stars...French Laundry.  I just cannot comprehend how One Market got onto this list?!\n\nVivian's rating based on the Yelp system:\n\n3 stars for the food  - 1 star for no complimentary birthday dessert and the prices.\n\n2 stars.

Two of us ordered the deluxe Dine About Town menus, one the regular DAT, and two ordered straight off the menu. I tried a few other things, but here's what I can remember.\n\nThe Amouse bouche was smoked paprika spiced tuna on a fried potato, and topped with micro basil: The potatoes were like a delicious gourmet \"tater tot,\" and the tuna was unbelievably good, probably the best thing I ate all evening. Despite the pretty presentation, it was a waste of good tuna-- the potatoes dominated the dish. This was best eaten unassembled. \n\nRancho Gordo Chick Pea Soup saffron, wild shrimp, ni\u00e7oise olives: The shrimp were crisp, and soup was very good overall.\nGeoduck Clam \"Chowder\" herbed cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, celery, house-cured pancetta: The soup might have been better had we been provided with an instruction manual. The base was too subtly flavored, and when I mixed in the creme fraiche, it became overly sour and the flavor of the underlying soup disappeared. Even still, the richness and acidity of the soup could not cut the extreme fishiness of the geoduck. Overall, the celery, geoduck, and creme fraiche were all overpowering, and poorly interacted. \n\nRoasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast, duck leg confit, saffron, anson mills polenta, red cabbage, cocoa reduction: There were too many \"buts.\" The duck breast was good, but not as ducky as the Liberty Farms Duck Breast I've had before. There were two rectangular slices of confit. They tasted right, but the texture was too dry. The polenta grains had just the right amount of resistance, but were too salty. The cocoa reduction had a complex flavor, but there wasn't enough of it for me to go into more detail. The tart and crisp red cabbage was the one solid item, and was a good pairing to the rest of the dish. I could imagine this dish shining on a different night.\n\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts applewood smoked bacon. The sprouts were perfectly cooked, and the scattered leaves were so good they could have been used as a dish by themselves. The bacon was top quality.\n\nValrhona Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 Cake blood orange gel\u00e9e, jivara chocolate mandarin ice cream. The souffle was light, evenly cooked, and a good place between sweet and bitter. Their accompaniments were well matched, and plentiful enough to allow for you to experiment with a few cool combinations. The blood orange and raspberry sauce was especially good.\n\nWhite Peach sorbet, strawberry consomm\u00e9, fresh berries, almond shortbread.  Divorced from their actual fruits, it was fun trying to figure out what the sorbets contained-- scoops of apricot and raspberry sorbet were added, but not listed on the menu. Regardless, they each were delicious, smooth, and didn't have any ice crystals. \n\nI'm somewhat surprised to be giving a Michelin 1 Star a 3/5 rating, but the unevenness of the savory dishes, despite some exception components, was really a downer.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["- Roasted Liberty Farms DUCK BREAST with duck leg confit, saffron, anson mills polenta, cocoa reduction - BEST duck.

Service here is attentive but we found ourselves having to reminder our server for things we had previously asked. We came here for Dine About Town and the choices on there were amazing! Here's what I got to try...\n\nRASPBERRY LEMONADE\nI did not get to try this but I have to write about it. When it came to our table, it was an awesome presented drink! It looked like a huge slushee, not just red colored juice which I was imagining but a mix of the yellow lemonade with the deep red raspberry.\n\nCHICK PEA FRIES (not on DAT menu but A MUST GET!)\nI've NEVER heard of a place that has chick pea fries! I imagined it to taste like hummus but it wasn't quite just hummus. For some reason, it wasn't oily at all and it was good with the aioli dipping sauce. Somewhat powerful so don't dip too much in it unless you want to just taste the aioli sauce. It's definitely worth the $7.50 they charge you for it. If you're scared of trying these chick pea fries b/c you don't like hummus, don't worry...it tastes SO much better.\n\nLENTIL SOUP\nThis was a cream based soup so I didn't really taste much of the lentil. I wouldn't go out of my way to order this but since it came with the DAT menu, I thought I'd give it a go. This tasted pretty good with the complimentary bread they start you off with.\n\nMUSHROOM POT PIE\nOMG. This was heaven! They bring out the pot pie in a pot and then they disassemble it for you. They take off the flaky crust and put it on the side of your plate, then dump the mushroom cream filling into your big plated bowl. There were a variety of mushrooms in here and there were no button mushrooms -- thank goodness! Button mushrooms are good but I think they're low-class mushrooms. This was paired off well with cubes of root vegetables -- carrots, potatoes, and a few others I can't remember. Yum. \n\nPEAR TART DESSERT (forgot what i's called)\nThis was so filling!

It is not inexpensive but if you either have the expendable cash for a dinner that can approach $100+ or are looking for a place to celebrate a special occassion, this is the place.\n\nThe bar is lively even on a Tuesday night at 5 p.m. It's primarily business people but I also saw a young kid with a backpack grinning ear to ear as he hosted his young female friend at the bar. The picture window, the location, it just feels good to be inside the space.\n\nThe dining room is large and I definately suggest dining at or near the windows. It's filled with an enthusiastic business crowd. Our server Steven Anderson was very quick on the trigger to confirm, advise although we were pretty decisive and just  be there when needed.\n\nWe were both drawn toward the same entree so I can't give a complete review on entrees but the Pan Seared Scallops were to die for. I am guessing there were fewer than 6 of them but the lobster emulsion ( and I don't even like Lobster) stole the show... the bubbling red broth, the creaminess of the mashed potato or sweet potatoes at the base and the crispy artichoke made the dish outstanding.\n\nWe order something that just sounded fun-- chick pea fries and I gotta tell you that dipping those fries into the lobster emultion... sent me ... Divine!\n\nAs the entrees don't come with anything not stated like the beef, chicken or whatever we also got a side of spinach which was wonderful but not out of the ordinary.\n\nWhat was however also out of the ordinary was the beet salad where instead of the typical chunks of beets they were sliced thin with radish, goat cheese and a vinagrette really beautifully plated.\n\nThis is all food to eat slowly while enjoying conversation as it's not hefty serving of food but a cause of celebration of food. Petite cuisine? You decide.\n\nGreat salad, great fries, great entrees.\n\nWhat was unusual is that without asking the bread server continued to bring over  a crispy white and an olive roll. Again, just impeccible and the servers just seem to be around without the need to hail them or if there was the need, the wait was only momentary.\n\nWe opted for the mini trio for dessert and got two gorgeous mini flans-- a coffee and a vanilla, various little cookies, a butterscotch pudding and a chocolate nut torte. Splitting them made it seem as if we'd hardly ordered much but again because the food is very rich and flavorful it seems that less is more here.\n\nWe wanted to try a great deal, didn't want liquor or coffees so we ordered more plates of food than one might but not the liquids and our bill still came to about $100 with the tax.\n\nIt was so darn memorable that frankly I can't help but recommend these folks highly. Their food is as good as the day it opened 20 years or so ago, maybe better.\n\nDid server Seven Anderson make the difference? I don't know but to be on the safe side you might request to be in his section.\n\nThey also have a new wine tasting room that can be rented for parties or larger parties that spread into the lobby of One Market so lots of creative ways to utilize this setting.\n\nI love the nearby Boulevard as well but simply hadn't dined for years at ONE MARKET and it turned out to be a great place to celebrate my birthday-- won't tell you which one!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-20"}, {"excerpts": ["We shared a few sides, brussel sprouts, spinach, and chick pea fries.

The Amuse Bouche of tuna with wasabe was pretty good...a bit fishy, but again, pretty good. \n\nWe went there because my boss' wife wanted \"american\" food, and i could not get a reservation at Town Hall for a reasonable time. I should have dropped a $20 on the reservationist at TH...the two restaurants are in seperate leagues. For the money, One Market is no where near the quality it should be. For that matter, the Lark Creek Group, is no where near the quality it once was. \n\nThe appetizers around the table were OK...but just ok. My fennel soup was salty, not much crab, and generally uninspired. The crab salad my boss had was much more of science project with gelatin cubes and jalapeno sorbet than crab. The foie gras my wife ordered was delicious....and my boss' wife's salad was, well, a salad!\n\nAs for the main courses, the two men had lamb shank. Dry, rubbery, salty, on a bed of very salty lentils. My wife's pasta was thicker than Pasta Pamadoro. Once again, my boss' wife chose well...she had the black cod, which looked delish. We shared a few sides, brussel sprouts, spinach, and chick pea fries. All were better than the main courses....\n\nAs for dessert, this course was the highlight. We had to order a second butterscotch pudding it was so good. The choc souffle was also incredible.\n\nI feel slightly guilty giving such a low star rating, HOWEVER, SF is a foodie town, and if we are being honest, One Market did not live up to its reputation nor the cost of the meal.  Two stars means \"Meh, I've experienced better\". That is definitely the case. It should also take into account the $75-100 per person cost. One Market is categorized as a top quality SF restaurant. It is not. If you have 1) a discerning palette, 2) experienced top quality restaurants here or elsewhere, and are 3) honest with yourself about your culinary experiences, this is not a place deserving of its accolades.

I ask for pairing suggestions often and it's usually a seamless process. Also I found it odd for the dine about town menus, we were told there were the same 2 wines no matter the menu choice. Sure, some wines are that versatile, but I like the idea of a pairing being matched to a specific dish.\n\nBesides the blip in the service, I quite enjoyed my meal here even more than I was expecting.

I don't like to walk more than a 2 block radius from my office for lunch, which severely limits my lunch options, but damn it, if I wanted exercise I'd go to the gym and if I wanted to enjoy the weather I'd go to Tahoe. Walking around in an urban jungle is not my idea of fun. My Dine About Town junkie friend wanted to try this so I went along for the ride, and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the corner of Market and Steuart and is relatively large with a full bar and high ceilings. It has wall to wall windows on all the sides facing the street so it was really well lit. Having reservations (thanks Open Table!) we were seated right away. My companion was there for DAT, so of course she ordered off that menu. I however, do not like to judge a restaurant based solely on what it can sell for $21.95 at lunch so I ordered off the regular menu. Her starter was the Farmer's Market Salad, a rather pedestrian blend of greens and not a lot of flavor with it. I got the Gulf Shrimp over Cucumber, Daikon, with Green Chile Vinaigrette and just wow. Every bite a perfect blend of sweet shrimp, crunchy cucumber/daikon, and a nice bit of spicyness with the green chile. This dish displayed some seriously complex flavors. Next up, she had the Grilled Idaho Trout with Almond Vinaigrette. The fish was pretty good, it was served butterflied with the skin still on, The almonds worked well with the dish, but my only complaint was that some parts of the fish were overgrilled and tasted charred and bitter. The parts that were cooked correctly however, was amazing. I had the House Made Duck Ravioli in the Foie Gras emulsion and Maittake mushrooms. Again, another complex dish displaying some very advanced cooking techniques. I was hesitant to order the Duck Ravioli only because I was expecting one large ravioli over a bed of mushrooms. Fortunately, my gamble paid off and I was rewarded with 6(!) decent sized ravioli. It came in a foie gras emulsion (which is just a fancy way of saying foam). I enjoyed the flavors here as well, duck, foie gras, mushrooms, the chef certainly knew what he was doing. Small complaint was that the emulsion was on the salty side, but only slightly. You want to know why foie gras tastes so good to me? Because every time I take a bite of it a little piece of PETA dies. If we weren't meant to eat fattened goose livers, evolution would have provided a better defense mechanism against humans. You don't see us eating fattened lion livers.\n\nWe also got some sides. My companion ordered the Chick Pea Fries with Harissa Aioli and I think they also brought out some Sauteed Spinach and Buttered Mash Potatoes. The Chick Pea Fries were somewhat of a novelty, I've never seen chick peas served this way before and the aioli was perfect to dip in. There was a skin on the Mashed Potatoes, probably a function of sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The Spinach was a little soggy and again only bleh.\n\nFinally for dessert, my companion got the Peach Brown Butter Tart with Blueberry Compote and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream. Individually, each element was really good, but they didn't mix well together as a dish. The blueberries kind of overpowered everything and the Tart wasn't as peachy as I would have liked it to be. I ordered the Grand Marnier Strawberry Trifle with Citrus Scented Chiffon, Ricotta, Marscapone, and Candied Almonds, and WOW. Granted the first bite I dug into was full of Grand Marnier and was a little heady, but each successive bite was like a dessert explosion in my mouth with strawberries, chiffon, and marscapone all battling to make the biggest bang. It was so good, I licked the bowl, if you don't believe me, check out my profile pics.\n\nService was impeccable. The waitress kept our bread basket bountiful and our water topped off. I think my companion was annoyed at her coming over so often, but I'm needy and crave attention so that was fine by me. The biggest downer was that she failed to mention that for Dine About Town, they charged an 18% gratuity. What the?!! I've never been mugged inside a restaurant before but this was a first. I didn't even order off the DAT menu and I still got charged the 18%. I mean really?

I still feel disappointed when I leave, and that isn't what I should be feeling when I leave such an establishment.  The space is beautiful, and full of grandeur, but that is about it.  For instance, my experience a while back for Dine About Town was a three course lunch midweek.  We had an 11:30 reservation.  Got there a couple minutes early, and was seated promptly at 11:30.  We were one of the first tables seated for their lunch service, and placed our order quickly.  We received bread, and a delicious iced tea infused with peach and served alongside a peach puree for extra sweetening.  The first course came out quickly, the spring mixed green salad.  It was fresh and perfectly dressed, we enjoyed this quite a bit... then we waited for our second course... we waited... we waited... we waited... by this time 45 minutes had passed since we placed our order.

He made a snarky remark, \"Well this IS a three course meal you know, it takes time.

I must say, this isn't a fluke, and I wont be returning unless it is for business and someone else is paying, or drinks and apps in the bar area.  I should mention my prior lunch experience here about 10 months ago.  They tried to serve me a raw grilled chicken sandwich... twice.  And explained it away by telling me the sandwich was made of dark meat.  Um, I love dark meat, but I do not love raw dark meat chicken.  I don't know any restaurant that serves up raw chicken... and twice... they seared my meat again from the original sandwich and placed it on the same bread I sent it back on.  (I had cut my sandwich in half and that is when I noticed it was raw)  That said, I sent it back, it came back raw still and on the bread I had cut in half with all the raw chicken juices still on it.  CAN WE SAY SALMONELLA???  The floor manager came by and gave me the dark meat excuse then offered me a different sandwich.  Then she explained to me the tuna sandwich is seared, so it will arrive raw.  HELLO!!!  Tuna can be served seared and raw in the middle, I love raw tuna, sashimi, etc.  I DO NOT like raw chicken, and don't know anyone who does.  Food poisoning people, food poisoning... hasn't any of the staff heard of what happens when you eat raw chicken???  Anyway.  As I said before, I will likely return for business as so many people like to go there for meetings, etc.  This will never be my first choice with so many other great options around.

Shaved beef tongue salad with an almost kimchee-like cabbage, croutons and frozen crumbles of horseradish that can easily be mistaken for cheese crumbles.  Of these two I prefer the soup, but both are still very good. \n- Entrees: Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin medallions over persillade and sliced dehydrated apples.  Pan seared Alaskan halibut with fish stick (love their version of the fish stick).  Both are great but the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin stands out here.  Pork wrapped around more pork!?!  Should be featured on Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations' Food Porn episode!  Initially the tenderloin did not look especially tender or juicy but to my delighted surprise it very much was.  Coupled with the savory and crunchy bacon exterior this dish is just plain excellent with a nice and mild smokey open-fire-grill flavor.    \n- Extra sides: Buttery mashed potatoes.

I don't know if other guests park their cars in a garage and just walk to the restaurant, but my boyfriend opted for valet (they park your car at the nearest curb to the entrance of the restaurant).\n\nOur dinner reservation was for 7:15, but we were a tad early and arrived around 6:45. Lucklily, the hostess said that she was able to seat us. There is a pianist near the bar/waiting area, and large floor-length curtains that you have to go through to get to the hostess stand.\n\nAt first glance of the dinner menu, we decided to skip one of their \"starters\". My boyfriend ordered their \"bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin\" with an addition of their \n\"buttery mashed potatoes\", and I decided on their \"pan-seared day boat scallops\". Of course with a round of martinis with a twist and a cosmopolitan on the side.\n\nOne of the servers gave us water and offered us a choice of two breads while we wait for our food: some sort of sourdough, or a \"olive\" bread (I'm sorry, I forgot the exact name of the bread). The \"olive\" bread was sort of a mixed bag for me. Some bites the bread was yummy with just right amount of bread to olive ratio, other bites were straight up chunks of olives (yes, actual olive chunks are in the bread).\n\nOur entrees took quite some time to get out. My boyfriend and I were thinking that the kitchen were making up for our early arrival with the delay in food preparation. Another server approched our table with a \"compliments of the kitchen\" dish that was two spoonfuls of some potatoe blob (again, my apologies for not remembering the exact name). It was good, but it only made me more hungry and more eager for my food.\n\nOverall, our entrees were delicious. My boyfriend commented that their tenderloin was cooked to perfection, and the bacon was nice touch. Their scallops were satisfactory, and the artichoke accompanied it well. Their mashed potatoes were fluffy and buttery indeed. I honestly would prefer mashed potatoes that had cheese in it (or are cheesy), but that's just me.\n\nAs for dessert, I chose to have their pumpkin cheesecake and my boyfriend ordered their \"mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich\". Side note: They offer this $15 \"mini platter\" of their \"singular sensations\", any three of your choice. I didn't see this till now, nor did our waiter offer this to us. Their \"mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich\" was just as it is described. My only thing is, I am a huge mint and/with chocolate fan, so I am very particular about my mint taste.

We were running late due to rush hour traffic issues and called ahead to warn them we'd be about 15 minutes late. They were accommodating and pleasant, and our table was ready and waiting as soon as we arrived. Knowing we'd only have one glass of wine each, we asked to sample all three of their Pinot Noirs before deciding and our request was met with a smile. We settled on the Testarossa Lark Creek Cuv\u00e9e Pinot Noir, which was delicious.\n\nPluses: \n* The location is excellent -- right across the street from the Ferry Building, with easy access by car and inexpensive valet parking. An abundance of windows make for great people and scenery watching.\n* The Spring Vegetable Salad was delicious and refreshing, with crispy vegetables and a basil oil that was so good that it stood out as a favorite part of the entire meal.\n* The Almond Wood-Smoked Wild Salmon, a limited-time special, was delicious. It had a distinct flavor that was unlike any other salmon I'd tried before, and it was cooked to perfection. According to our server, it's only available about three weeks per year -- the only disappointing part of the dish.\n* The portions are huge for a fine dining restaurant -- way bigger than any I've seen at a Michelin-starred restaurant. My friend and I shared a single salad appetizer, split two entrees and two sides, and we might have finished 1/2 of what we ordered. \n* Service was prompt, organized and efficient. Glasses were kept full, the table was kept clean and organized, and plates were cleared quickly and unobtrusively. And, when a near-empty glass of wine was accidentally knocked over, it was cleaned up and the stain covered in what felt like seconds. Altogether, a great service experience.\n\nMinuses:\n* While the food was good, and had some definite bright spots, it fell short of spectacular. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't quite at the level I've come to expect from similarly lauded San Francisco restaurants.\n* The Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, recommended as one of their \"signature dishes\", was a little too salty for my taste. Granted, this may be because I'm a flexitarian and hadn't had pork in quite a while, but my instinct tells me it just wasn't quite right. Also, my fellow diner and I agreed that the pork was a little overdone, and the dish overall looked and felt like it had been kept under a heat lamp for a while. \n* The sides -- Wild Nettle Polenta and Buttery Mashed Potatoes -- also had that \"heat lamp\" appearance and, while tasty enough, were rather ordinary. \n\nOn balance, I had an exceedingly neutral experience at One Market.

I had been meaning to try here, but it was always hard to justify paying that much money for lunch and there are too many better places in the area for dinner.  Anyway, there were four of at the table (two of them were our interview candidates, so it was sort of a tenuous situation), but we ordered two appetizers to share and everyone got their own meal.  We ordered the following:\n\nAppetizers:\n-Lightly Smoked Tasmanian Ocean Trout \"Mi Cuit\" potato r\u00f8sti, pancetta vinaigrette, pastured chicken egg: I'm actually not a big fan of trout, so I sort of freaked out and ended up just eating the pancetta on the plate.  It wasn't much, but everyone at the table thought it was incredible.  I should note that the reason we got this was because they had run out of their crab cakes that day.  It's 12:30pm in prime lunch hour and you've run out a signature item?  There's something not right with that.  Our waiter kept coming back to this item, so we caved and ended up with this.  \n\n-Oysters on the Half Shell: YUM YUM YUM.  Usually I'm not a big fan of fishy slimy things, but I adore oysters, especially when there's a great sauce or garnish to go with it.  I really enjoyed their couple of sauce options that came out on the beautifully presented plate.  We each had one, but I was secretly wishing that someone would pass on their oyster.\n\nMains:\n-Roasted All Natural Half Chicken braised cipollini, chicken jus with a side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts Applewood Smoked Bacon: To be totally honest, I enjoyed the brussel sprouts more than the chicken.  I mean these brussel sprouts were cooked to where they were slightly crispy and cooked in the bacon.  I mean, I could go on and on about how awesome these things were.  Ultimately, I finished the brussel sprouts when I couldn't really finish all the chicken.  The chicken itself was moist with great skin, but, and maybe this was my fault, it was just chicken.\n\n-Two people ordered the Grilled Salmon:  The piece of fish was presented PERFECTLY on the plate.  I didn't get to try it, but it looked beautiful.  Both people finished their plates.\n\n-House-Made Potato Gnocchi Liberty Farms duck leg, yellow foot chanterelles, natural jus: This was my second choice from a food perspective, and when it came out, I was slightly envious.  My co-worker said that the duck was absolutely delicious and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly.  Next time, I'd be interested in trying this dish.\n\nThe service here was OK, I wasn't sure about our waiter who seemed a little pushy on getting us to order more things.  Ultimately, we were able to have our time to talk to each other uninterrupted and it turned out to being a pretty good meal.  I'm not sure if I'd go back, but I certainly think that for a business lunch, it was perfect.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-11-08"}]}
