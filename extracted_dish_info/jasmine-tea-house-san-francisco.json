Food comes quickly and is always hot and I have never had to wait for a table, which means it's not crowded or noisy.\n\nAnd let's talk about the food. I haven't tried any of their meat dishes except the ostrich (which is freakin amazing), but I've loved everything else (especially the sesame meatless chicken, veg potstickers, hot & sour soup, & veg mushu). I find that some dishes have the over-saltiness or over-greasiness that many chinese take-out type places have, although it is very slight here (I may be extra-sensitive to this because I do a ton of chinese cooking at home and I use much less oil). But, that's easily solved by asking your waiter for less oil or less salt or whatever you want and they will do it! \n\nTheir meatless chicken is AMAZING and you can ask for it in the style of pretty much any of their chicken dishes even if it's not on the menu. I also like to ask for the meatless chicken not breaded or fried because it's much healthier that way, plus I like it better anyway. Basically, they will allow you to ask for substitutes or changes to their menu (within reason) without even frowning about it, so that alone wins them a ton of points in my book. Add tofu to your veggie dish, or eliminate those darn water chestnuts from your basil chicken.

So I've frequented this place, plenty, over the past year (or maybe even 2?), and for shame, I only now write a review (UPDATE: Inaccurate ~ forgot I posted a review, before; see below..). My hope is that this message is read and received, with a mind for progress with this establishment..\n\nThey've gone from an absolutely spectacular little restaurant to order from to the subpar stature of most every other Chinese food place in the Mission area ~ one often blames popularity for this shift (and this place has definitely grown in popularity).. I would just hope that they haven't grown comfortable not trying as hard. As I continue this review, accept my apologies if I seem to wax nostalgic.\n\nA year+ ago, the food was *amazing*. I'd think I were being hyperbolic, but I distinctly recall coming away with the same impression about their food, each time, before. My measuring of Chinese food establishments tends to rest on a small set of 'staples' that I use to compare different establishments: the chow mein, the general tso's chicken, and their pot stickers. Price Matters, and is considered heavily (not specifically for being *cheap*, which is important, but if Free is the best spice on steroids, spendy Chinese better be Very freakin flavorful..).\n\nI write this review, and it pains me(kindanotreally), because where a year ago this place was absolute Top marks ~ not Only for price, which was just fantastically cheap (assuming because they were very new), but for Flavor & Quality. The pot stickers, here, at a time, were long and aways the best in the Mission. Period. AND amongst the cheapest. Now I feel a bit ripped off. They've gone up ~$2 per order, since.. their quality has gone down significantly (biting into hard chunks of gristle is Gross ~ this has happened at least a few times more recently), and the flavor's just not there, anymore, beyond those respects/concerns. \n\nWhen the pot stickers go, the rest follow ~ the other dishes have gone up in price, down in quality. The chow mein (once also really good) is just oilier and less flavorful. I still like the General Tso's chicken. Also, their combo Won Ton soup was a steal and a blessing lol, and I still love to order that to this day. The dim sum is also pretty awesome, though, again, food quality concerns (gristly pork siu mai.. ew)..\n\nAppreciate that this review is less a damning of the establishment and more the noted frustrations of a once-immensely pleased patron. It took a long enough time to find a place in the area that delivered really good Chinese food, and this was IT, once. I write this with the realization that this establishment has since come to risk attaining a similar mediocrity (at inflated price points)  that the rest of the Mission seems dead set upon resting on. And it's sad, really. Just not something I want to see..\n\n\n===== Original Review:\n\nI really have to say that I am impressed with the food that comes out of this place. I have ordered food here a few times, and they've been consistently delicious. For one, their potstickers are better than most everyone else's in town, period. Most anywhere I go, I order the potstickers (a. because iLoves them and b. its a good 'quality test' for a Chinese cuisine establishment), and consistently, Jasmine Tea House outclasses the rest for flavor and texture and just overall preparedness. \n\nThis applies for the dim sum, as well - the pork siu mai and shanghai baby bun were, too, some of the best I've had in the city. In general, I am very happy with how well the food is prepared, here. It was worth getting on here to write a review for them.

I haven't tried any of their meat dishes except the ostrich (which is freakin amazing), but I've loved everything else (especially the sesame meatless chicken, veg potstickers, hot & sour soup, & veg mushu). I find that some dishes have the over-saltiness or over-greasiness that many chinese take-out type places have, although it is very slight here (I may be extra-sensitive to this because I do a ton of chinese cooking at home and I use much less oil). But, that's easily solved by asking your waiter for less oil or less salt or whatever you want and they will do it! \n\nTheir meatless chicken is AMAZING and you can ask for it in the style of pretty much any of their chicken dishes even if it's not on the menu. I also like to ask for the meatless chicken not breaded or fried because it's much healthier that way, plus I like it better anyway. Basically, they will allow you to ask for substitutes or changes to their menu (within reason) without even frowning about it, so that alone wins them a ton of points in my book. Add tofu to your veggie dish, or eliminate those darn water chestnuts from your basil chicken.
