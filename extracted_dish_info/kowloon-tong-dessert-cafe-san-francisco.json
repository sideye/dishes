Normally I dismiss servers at these HK dessert places as they normally don't care about service, but Alvin is an acception to this stereotype.  He noticed the three of us taking pictures of each other and cheerfully offered to take a picture for us.  \n\nWhile I'm not big on HK desserts, I settled instead my usual: The Waffle Sundae.  Joy and I shared this thing as it's clearly enough for 2-3 people.  It comes with 5 to 6 pieces of Waffle triangles and 3 different flavors of Ice Cream. We opted for the Green Tea, Strawberry and Mango flavor, and ordered it without whip cream.  \n\nCandice ordered the Coconut Sago with Tapoica and the three of us shared an order of Egg Puffs.  \n\nEgg Puffs are my favorite here with a nice vanilla flavor, and not overly doughy for my preference.  They also had a nice crunch to them as well that night. \n  \nOur Sundae arrived--only to notice that it had whip cream, when we requested for it without.  We flagged down Alvin.  He quickly and sympathetically apologized and offered to have another made for us.  He also asked if we wanted to keep the present sundae, which was declined.  But this is definitely a first for me.  \n\nI've had my share of negative experiences in Asian restaurants where they continue to pursuade you to keep the order or fight you to get you to believe it was your fault for not mentioning, or something of the sort.  But Alvin was so accomodating, and made sure our order was correct the next time around, and sure enough it was.  \n\nMy only complaint about the Waffle Sundae, is that the ice cream seemed to be topped with some sort of nasty crushed burnt peanuts which really ruined the sweetness for me.  But other than this, I enjoyed my sundae.\n\nCandice on the other hand, with her Coconut Sago and Tapipoca found her dessert unedible.  It was so bland and bitter with absolutely no coconut flavor.  Rather, it tasted of plain warm milk with tapoica.  She found it more pleasureable to try to see if she could take all of the tapioca balls out of her dessert just for the fun of it, as only one taste of it was enough for her.  Silly girl! \n\nService on this particular night was truly great for the first time here.  Both Alvin and the other server working that night were very friendly and continously refilled our hot tea.

It was about 7pm. But we were on a dessert mission so we started going crazy with the menu. We decided to order the egg waffle, the steamed rice crepe, coconut milk taro sago, and the banana split waffle sandwich. BUT then one of my friends spotted the check-in deal.\n\nWe added up our 4 dishes and it totaled to be about $17 so we all agreed that we should order one more dish to get our FREE ice cream waffle (because we just needed to check-in and tag a friend on FB to get the deal). And that is what we did. We ordered a red bean soup with peanut filled glutinous balls (I really wanted to try this). Thus, we got 2 more desserts with a total of 4 desserts and 2 snacks :) Gym time later.\n\nMost of the food was decent at best. The egg waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't too sweet either. The rice crepe was OK, the noodles didn't taste that fresh, like those you can buy at Asian markets and the sauce was bland. The coconut milk taro sago didn't taste like coconut (to my friend's disappointment) and it was a bit starchy. \n\nThe red bean soup was so disappointing. There wasn't a lot of red beans so it was liquidy (I like my red bean soup with LOTS of red bean). The glutinous balls were OK but the peanut filling was nowhere near as good as the ones I had in Hong Kong.\n\nNow the real winners of KTDC were the ice cream waffle sandwiches. We got the banana split waffle sandwich and the vanilla ice cream with bananas were so delicious. For our free ice cream sandwich we decided to get green tea and mango ice cream filling. AWESOME ICE CREAM. There's something about their ice cream. It's probably one of the best ice creams I've had and their waffles were soooo good.

The waffle itself was very crispy/crunchy, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you like, but I prefer mine with a touch of softness.\n\nThe FRENCH TOAST was pretty good and had a really nice golden eggy crust (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=g6LZYfaAoeaa59Wg9Gmz1A). They use one slice of thick bread instead of two thinner ones with kaya jam in the middle, so it needed a lot of syrup for moisture.\n\nFrom the Yelp pictures, their BLACK SESAME PASTE looked really good. The pics must've been touched up by Mariah Carey's photoshoppers though because in person it was lacklustre (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=IR8bY8Sfp7EpnMV_-em8GQ). Instead of being densely black in colour, this one was slightly translucent and looked like it was made from a mix. Although I'm pretty sure they make it from scratch, they definitely don't use enough black sesame seeds so the flavour wasn't very strong. But, at least it wasn't too sweet. The SESAME BALLS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=Fs81IFxLa7fRizSV_ZHPtA) could've used more black sesame too. There was too much dough and not enough filling :(\n\nThe most disappointing was the EGG CUSTARD. Blandest custard ever! No coconut milk flavour and (I can't believe I'm saying this) could've used more sugar. The crunch from the black sticky rice at the bottom was nice though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=LlckTpv2YSghYh-fTfEWJQ) and the custard itself had a really nice creamy consistency (maybe from the coconut milk?)\n\nOverall, it was OK.

So instead, we seated ourselves and the overall atmosphere was casual and relaxed. \n\nPopcorn Chicken ($3.95): Chicken was breaded and deep-fried but lacked the crispy textures, seasoning, and basil and red pepper. Not as good as the ones at Factory Tea Bar.\n\nEgg Puff ($2.50): One of my favorite Hong Kong desserts. I used to buy these as hand warmers when I lived in the Boston area. However, there were too many air pockets instead of a cake-like soft and spongy center. It tasted like a vanilla sugar cone and not the egg puffs I'm addicted to. Seems like a popular item here, but I don't recommend it.\n\nBlack Sesame Paste ($3.95): The flavor of Black Sesame was decent, but the paste could be a lot thicker with stronger aroma. The quality did not match the ones at Phoenix Food Boutique, My Favorite Caf\u00e9, and 100% Sweet Caf\u00e9. \n\nMixed Fruit Honeydew Sago ($4.75): I loved the taste of the sago, but the fruit was not ripe enough to add to the flavors. \n\nI love Hong Kong style desserts, but why is it that service is always super slow and completely absent? I had to get out of my seat numerous times in order to get the server's attention.

It was about 7pm. But we were on a dessert mission so we started going crazy with the menu. We decided to order the egg waffle, the steamed rice crepe, coconut milk taro sago, and the banana split waffle sandwich. BUT then one of my friends spotted the check-in deal.\n\nWe added up our 4 dishes and it totaled to be about $17 so we all agreed that we should order one more dish to get our FREE ice cream waffle (because we just needed to check-in and tag a friend on FB to get the deal). And that is what we did. We ordered a red bean soup with peanut filled glutinous balls (I really wanted to try this). Thus, we got 2 more desserts with a total of 4 desserts and 2 snacks :) Gym time later.\n\nMost of the food was decent at best. The egg waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't too sweet either. The rice crepe was OK, the noodles didn't taste that fresh, like those you can buy at Asian markets and the sauce was bland. The coconut milk taro sago didn't taste like coconut (to my friend's disappointment) and it was a bit starchy. \n\nThe red bean soup was so disappointing. There wasn't a lot of red beans so it was liquidy (I like my red bean soup with LOTS of red bean). The glutinous balls were OK but the peanut filling was nowhere near as good as the ones I had in Hong Kong.\n\nNow the real winners of KTDC were the ice cream waffle sandwiches. We got the banana split waffle sandwich and the vanilla ice cream with bananas were so delicious. For our free ice cream sandwich we decided to get green tea and mango ice cream filling. AWESOME ICE CREAM. There's something about their ice cream. It's probably one of the best ice creams I've had and their waffles were soooo good. Crispy and sweet with a tinge of maple syrup flavor. \n\nI wouldn't come back here any time soon because their food is not out-of-this-world-amazing, but their ice cream sandwiches are fantastic.

Back then the free ice cream waffle was at a minimum of $25 or more and now it's $30 (probably for the last few years). Still a good deal though. The ice cream is high quality because it's made with Dreyers ice cream and you can taste the high quality. Everything here is so fun to eat. You can order cold food, hot food, dessert and more.

I especially missed the food and desserts. So when my friend told me about Kowloon Tong Dessert Cafe, we were dying to try it. \n\nIt was a long ride to KTDC but when my friends and I got here, it was a bit disappointing because there wasn't a lot of people there. It was about 7pm. But we were on a dessert mission so we started going crazy with the menu. We decided to order the egg waffle, the steamed rice crepe, coconut milk taro sago, and the banana split waffle sandwich. BUT then one of my friends spotted the check-in deal.\n\nWe added up our 4 dishes and it totaled to be about $17 so we all agreed that we should order one more dish to get our FREE ice cream waffle (because we just needed to check-in and tag a friend on FB to get the deal). And that is what we did. We ordered a red bean soup with peanut filled glutinous balls (I really wanted to try this). Thus, we got 2 more desserts with a total of 4 desserts and 2 snacks :) Gym time later.\n\nMost of the food was decent at best. The egg waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't too sweet either. The rice crepe was OK, the noodles didn't taste that fresh, like those you can buy at Asian markets and the sauce was bland. The coconut milk taro sago didn't taste like coconut (to my friend's disappointment) and it was a bit starchy. \n\nThe red bean soup was so disappointing. There wasn't a lot of red beans so it was liquidy (I like my red bean soup with LOTS of red bean). The glutinous balls were OK but the peanut filling was nowhere near as good as the ones I had in Hong Kong.\n\nNow the real winners of KTDC were the ice cream waffle sandwiches. We got the banana split waffle sandwich and the vanilla ice cream with bananas were so delicious. For our free ice cream sandwich we decided to get green tea and mango ice cream filling. AWESOME ICE CREAM. There's something about their ice cream. It's probably one of the best ice creams I've had and their waffles were soooo good. Crispy and sweet with a tinge of maple syrup flavor. \n\nI wouldn't come back here any time soon because their food is not out-of-this-world-amazing, but their ice cream sandwiches are fantastic.

A few things to note:\n\n-After 9pm Kowloon will be PACKED!\n\n-CASH ONLY\n\n-waffles for the waffle sammy can vary in size, big one nite and small the next but still worth it! \n\n-Can be a healthier alternative to fatty American desserts!\n\nfobby definition of the day: Sago\n\nSago is a starch extracted from the pith of sago palm stems, Metroxylon sagu.

The mango sago was sweet, just how I like it, with huge mango chunks and pretty much all sago mixed with coconut milk and mango juice. However, the red bean shaved ice was more like ice from a snow cone and didn't have much flavor. But when it melted into the condensed milk it was a little bit better. After that we were craving some more filling food so we decided to get the chicken wings which came with five pieces and lots of garlic, green onions, and peppers. It wasn't very spicy and all the toppings made it pretty tasty. \nApparently you can also reserve a table if you wish, since I saw a sign, but I'm not sure exactly how that works.

Why do i love this place so much? Besides the fact I love late night dessert, it's a good place to socialize with friends and hang out.\n\nFood:\nI'd recommend trying a bunch of stuff there:\n1) Strawberry sago: I am a big fan of strawberry and if you like strawberries, I'd recommend the strawberry sago. It is served with strawberries and sago pearls (mini tapioca balls except they taste much lighter and you can just slurp them up like a vacuum cleaner). It has a not too sweet and not too plain taste and serves as a light, refreshing dessert.\n\n2) Egg Puffs: Yea, typical, I know but they taste even better when you drizzle all that condensed milk on it.\n\n3) Ramen: They offer a variety of noodle choices paired with toppings. My personal favorite is the spicy instant noodle with luncheon meat (this is not the same as spam) and fried egg (come on, of course you need a fried egg in your ramen!). It has that delicious sodium-filled taste that makes you want to eat it even after a huge dinner with a minor kick to boot (this can vary depending on how wel you take spicy).\n\n4) Ice Cream Waffle Sandwich: Usually when i go, I go with a group of friends and we do a facebook check in (spend 20$ or more dollars and you get one for free). It is a literally waffle sandwich with ice cream of your choice in the middle divided into 4 usually equal pieces. The waffle has that good savory taste to it paired with the sweet taste of the ice cream.\n\nRandom notes: This place gets packed on Friday and Saturday betwwen 10 and 1 (for one, this place is open longer than a majority of the dessert places around the area and everyone just loves getting late night food/dessert in the city) so be prepared to either get their earlier or wait.\n\nRecommended?

So instead, we seated ourselves and the overall atmosphere was casual and relaxed. \n\nPopcorn Chicken ($3.95): Chicken was breaded and deep-fried but lacked the crispy textures, seasoning, and basil and red pepper. Not as good as the ones at Factory Tea Bar.\n\nEgg Puff ($2.50): One of my favorite Hong Kong desserts. I used to buy these as hand warmers when I lived in the Boston area. However, there were too many air pockets instead of a cake-like soft and spongy center. It tasted like a vanilla sugar cone and not the egg puffs I'm addicted to. Seems like a popular item here, but I don't recommend it.\n\nBlack Sesame Paste ($3.95): The flavor of Black Sesame was decent, but the paste could be a lot thicker with stronger aroma. The quality did not match the ones at Phoenix Food Boutique, My Favorite Caf\u00e9, and 100% Sweet Caf\u00e9. \n\nMixed Fruit Honeydew Sago ($4.75): I loved the taste of the sago, but the fruit was not ripe enough to add to the flavors. \n\nI love Hong Kong style desserts, but why is it that service is always super slow and completely absent?

"], "author": "Tiffany C.", "review": "After visiting Schubert's bakery, we drove past Kowloon Tong Dessert Caf\u00e9 which piqued my parents' interests as they're pretty serious about their Hong Kong desserts. We came back at night with the intention to just eat a small snack, but we ended up eating dinner and dessert.\n\nThere's a ton of street parking if you go during the night. We avoided the late night crowd when we got here around 8 on a Friday night. Pretty soon there was a long list of people waiting for seats at the caf\u00e9. A lot of young adults/teenagers seem to frequent this place, buying desserts and chatting with each other, so I'd recommend coming a little earlier to avoid the crowd. \n\nThe menu is extensive. There are so many different dessert items that it took us quite awhile before we figured out what to order. From noodles to sago to milkshakes, they have pretty much all the essential Hong Kong desserts you can think of. \n\nDessert Items: \n\nMixed Fruit Sago w/ Condensed Milk: I just wanted to get a dessert item, and thought this sounded fairly good. It was underwhelming and definitely not what I was expecting. I think I could probably throw this concoction together at home. There were various fruits on top of the condensed milk, but nothing special. The condensed milk was sweet and the sago was chewy enough, but it pretty much tasted like a typical dessert you'd get at the end of a meal at a Chinese restaurant. I would not order this again. \n\nBlack Sesame Dessert: This was part of the daily special - I thought it tasted okay. It had a strong sesame flavor, which is preferred, but this dessert isn't a favorite of mine, so I can't really give a fair review. My parents thought it tasted pretty good, although I think they've had better from Premiere Dessert back in LA. \n\nEgg Waffles: Our waffles were a little burnt, so they came out crispy rather than soft. I actually prefer crispy, but the batter had no taste to it, so it was kind of like eating crispy crackers. The inside was pretty soft, but without the sweetness that it needs, it wasn't too good. \n\nComplimentary Ice Cream Waffles: If you spend over $30, they give you a free ice cream waffle dish, which my mom was set on trying. And I'm glad we did because this was probably the best thing I had here! They serve real Dreyer's ice cream, so they placed a thick scoop of vanilla ice cream in between two crispy waffles. It came out well. Because the batter is not sweet (probably the same batter as the Egg Waffle batter), the ice cream from the center really gives the entire bite the sweetness that I craved. The crispiness of the waffles and the softness of the ice cream really worked for me. \n\nHorlick Drink: This came with the daily special as well. The drink was okay. My parents really like the drink because it reminds them of their childhood days. There was good flavor, but I'm not a fan. \n\nSavory Dishes:\n\nCurry Fish Balls: There were 8 fish balls altogether. While the fish balls weren't too special - they tasted as if they were frozen beforehand - the curry did taste really good. It wasn't too spicy, but had a good earthy flavor to it that made me want to add rice to it. Not too bad. \n\nImitation Shark Fin Soup: $4.25 It was decent, but definitely had better in HK. Even HK's 7/11's have better tasting (and cheaper) imitation shark fin soup! I thought this one tasted too salty. There was a decent amount of ingredients inside, but the saltiness of the soup overpowered everything. \n\nSoya Chicken Wings with Vermicelli: $6.50 I thought this was a pretty decent dish considering the price. There were three chicken wings with a pretty big bowl of vermicelli. It was enough to fill my sister and me up. The dish took around 15 minutes to cook, and it was well worth the time because the chicken wings had good flavor that really soaked through beyond the skin of the chicken. The soup base was not too heavy and was quite light, which was nice. \n\nChicken and Pork daily special: This was $9.50 plus an additional $1.95. I thought the price was a little expensive considering the tiny pieces of chicken and pork that came with the dish. You're able to pick your choice of sauce, rice or spaghetti, one hot drink, and a dessert (additional $2). So overall this dish was over $13. There was a good amount of rice (which we used to soak up the curry sauce) as well as a small scoop of corn. The chicken and pork were cooked well and the skin had that crispy perfection to it. I just thought they were quite small. \n\ntl;dr - Overall, I thought it was a decent place to have dinner. It's reminiscent of Hong Kong, but doesn't really come close to the authenticity of HK's desserts and food. I would come back again for the ice cream waffle! There are actually a few other HK dessert stores within a few blocks of this one, but this was the most crowded.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-11-02"}], "pickle cabbage and sliced pork daily special": [], "mixed grill": []}
