{"combination platter": [{"excerpts": ["Here we go:\n\nCombination platter (all made in house items) - $6, not good value at all for such a small portion\nsoy goose - not bad. "], "author": "Ken K.", "review": "\"Dishes served do not contain garlic, onion and MSG. Immitation meat are made of soy product, yam, or wheat gluten\" - says Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant. This philosophy also adheres to the strict Buddhist vegan diet, where it is believed that garlic and onion (for example) stirs up unwanted things in the body (or provide un-necessary bloodflow to the nether regions).\n \nBah, so it's gonna taste flavor-free or shideous, you are probably thinking.\n\nWell you'll be mildly surprised. SF Bay Area folks have got it good. You can go low tech and make your own salad at home with certified organic produce from your upscale farmers market (or Trader Joe if you're on the el cheapo). Or if you feel like spending green to eat green, there's Millenium, Greens, and of course Ubuntu, and a myriad of other raw food slow food type choices.\n\nBut if you are of the A$N per$ua$ion, it's slim pickins for Vegetarian Chinese, unless you're a member of a Buddhist temple. Lucky Creation in Chinatown is an excellent place, but it's a different niche, a bit more downscale Cantonese vegetarian that does more stir fry. Ming's on Taraval offers great vegetarian versions of Canto dishes, but they share the same kitchen that serves meat and seafood. There's really no good Taiwanese vegan/vegetarian around, and Sogo Tofu in San Jose is not even a restaurant. R&G Lounge's vegetarian/soy abalone is like $18, but that's one dish, and you don't know what's in their magic sauce, as good and as overpriced it may be.\n\nThis is where Enjoy comes in. Even volunteers and members of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (NorCal chapter, out of Taiwan) swear by this place (I know, because they directed us here!)\n\nAs much as I wanted some starch and bovine in soup at San Tung, an overdose of meat products earlier in the week required a change of pace for this one meal, and EV was pretty much the no brainer.\n\nEV is run by Hong Kongers and is more or less considered Vegetarian Cantonese, despite the menu having vegetarian versions of American Chinese, Sichuan, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hakka Cantonese. You may find similar things as your local PF Panda Chow, but why go there?\n\nHere we go:\n\nCombination platter (all made in house items) - $6, not good value at all for such a small portion\nsoy goose - not bad. But not as decadent as some Shanghainese restos\nsoy chasiu - eeeehhhh, why bother. A hint of sweet and sour. Why not use molasses or honey like the real porker?\ntofu strips (dou-gan) - I've had better\nsweet and sour wheat gluten - good gluten texture, but sweet and sour sauce was not so good.\n\nDrumstick with sweet and sour sauce - the worst item of the evening. Do not get this thinking that it tastes like fried chicken. I'm sure those soy hot dogs taste a whole lot better. The SS sauce didn't help either. The soy drumstick we had at a friend's wedding at a Vietnamese Buddhist temple in San Jose easily blew this one away.\n\nBean Curd Rolls w/vegetable (stuffed with cabbage and mushroom) - this is #90 on the menu. NOW WE ARE TALKIN' AND BACK ON TRACK. A tad bit too salty, but this is truly authentic good Cantonese, even if entirely vegetarian. Supposedly 101 through 104 are also very good (those with mushroom dishes). This plate saved the entire meal. $8.50, but very well executed\n\nSpinach and pine nut fried rice (#120 on the menu) - most folks get the House Special Fried Rice, but this was off the beaten path, and it ended up being very tasty. How did they do it? Not greasy at all, and yet quite flavorful. No MSG, no garlic, no butter, no Benihana grill, what was the formula? I could only guess, maybe mushroom powder essence for flavoring. The major drawback....lots of inconsistent undercooked grains of rice (or old rice). But this was easily solved by pouring #90 dish's magic sauce over the rice.\n\nVegetarian won ton with mixed veg udon - would not have ordered this otherwise, but if you have a kid who didn't like the soy fried chicken and prefers noodles, this might save the day. Just as I had guessed, a mushroom based broth. The wontons had finely minced up veg and tofu inside. Overall a very forgettable bowl, but palatable. I was lamenting paying $8 for this, when I could have spent it on THIS\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTNzezUyNYw\n\nFree plate of very juicy and sweet oranges when we got the bill. However other tables got a small portion of pai tsai or pickled vegetable appetizers, but we never got it.\n\n3.5 stars in reality.

"], "author": "Anthony L.", "review": "Numero uno kids.  I have to start off by making it clear that I am by all means NOT a vegetarian, and I love meat -very much so!  I want to make this known, before taking the plunge.\n\nMy best friend and I have never before eaten at a vegetarian friendly restaurant.  Our expectations were low, I will admit.  I've been by this place many times, but never gave it the time of day.  We decided to take a deep breath, and pull up our boots, on the recommendation of another friend of mine.  This place quite simply blew our socks off.\n\nWalking in, there are three things you immediately notice.  One -this place is really clean, and well lit.  Two -this place is kind of small.  Three -the staff here is really friendly.\n\nWe ordered the Combination Platter (appetizer), Sweet & Sour Chicken, and the House Special Chow Mein.  \n\nThe \"combo-platter\" was delightful.  I was almost afraid to see what these meat imitating foods would taste like.  I now have a new found respect for soy products, yams, and wheat gluten.  Divine.  The flavors of all the different foods on this platter contrasted exceptionally well with one another -this actually applies to all of the dishes we ordered.\nFor two adults, I would recommend getting the large platter, instead of the small.  A nice preview of what was to come.\n\nSweet & Sour Chicken.  It also came adorned with carrots, and green bell peppers.  The carrots were nice and soft, not to be mistaken for mushy.  The bell peppers (which I normally don't eat) were fantastic.  At many other chinese restaurants, the bell peppers tend to be soggy with a drowned out taste.  But not here!  These bell peppers were done right.  Still slightly stiff/crunchy.  You benefit from the original taste of the bell pepper, AND the sweet and sour sauce.  I'd give it three thumbs up, unfortunately I only have two ;)\n\nHouse Special Chow Mein.  This dish was prepared better than any chinese restaurant I have been to.  The chow mein here was not bland in taste, and not lathered in oil and grease.  It went down easy, and had great taste!  The combination of mushrooms, vermicelli, bean sprouts, and others ingredients made for a mad flurry of outrageous flavor.  \n\nFor dessert you choose between papaya soup, or oranges.  Curious to see how the soup was, we went for it.  It was great.  It had fresh papaya, almonds, and and another ingredient I didn't recognize.  My friend doesn't like papaya fruit, but this soup turned him around and gave him a smack in the bee-hind!  Perfection in a bowl boys and girls.  Perfection.\n\nSo for two people, it ran us $26 plus tip.  The prices are a little higher than at say, some other places to dine for similar foods, but only by a couple dollars, really.  Definitely worth a try -I am positive you will not be let down.\n\nThe staff was very nice, and very accommodating.  As a quick aside however, this place is small.  Almost cramped -but still cozy.  Go there early to get a table.  Also parking isn't exactly ideal; I had to circle the block a couple times.  No parking lot, just street parking.  \nVegetarian or not, ch-ch-ch-check it out, and ENJOY VEGETARIAN!\n\nThis place will definitely see me again, and they definitely have my patronage.  If I go somewhere to eat and I am \"just satisfied,\" it is really only four stars to me.  In order for any place of business to get a five star rating from me, they need to exceed the standard.

(Nothing has so surprised my taste buds since the first time I tasted gulab jamun at an Indian restaurant).\n\nEnjoy Vegetarian is a true \"gem hidden in the robe\" of the Inner Sunset. (And a short walk to Andronico's Market).\n\nIt was no surprise to me to find lots of Buddhist literature on the table by the entrance on the way out.\n\nI place my palms together and bow to a wonderful, gentle dining experience. \n\n                                                              _()_\n\nSecond visit (08-04-12): We started off with the small Reishi Medicine Soup (#24).  I loved it with its very slightly sweet undertone but I know it might be an acquired taste for many western palates. Along with the soup we added the Golden Basket (#13) appetizer, which was definitely too much for two people; we ended up taking half of it home. It had a wonderful selection and, in spite of being deep fried, was not greasy at all. I've been vegetarian for 25 years but the soy chicken could have fooled me; both the flavor and texture were amazing!\n\nMain dishes: House Special Fried (Brown) Rice (#105) was light and fluffy with veggies and small cubes of faux BBQ pork and ham; the Taro, sesame chicken in coconut sauce (#32) is a MUST! We once again went with a favorite, the eggplant with sea bass (#45).  And, having tried the rice balls in rice wine the last time, we decided to try the rice balls in hot ginger syrup. Am I ever glad we did? If you like ginger, you have to finish your meal with this dessert.\n\nOne of the nicest parts of the meal was the friendly folks working there.  Our waiter, Ben, happens to be the son of the owner of the three Enjoy Vegetarian restaurants in San Francisco. He was friendly, attentive and fun to talk with.\n\nMy buddy and I will be making visits to this Sunset neighborhood restaurant a family tradition.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-08-03"}], "fried won tons": [], "veggie sticky rice dumplings": [], "veggie duck": [{"excerpts": ["* Veggie Duck, 6.99  |  sliced bean curd w/ diced shiitake mushrooms in the middle that fall off...\n", "* Ma Po Tofu, 12.99  ", "|  ", "classic dish w/out the meat...

"], "author": "Anthony L.", "review": "Numero uno kids.  I have to start off by making it clear that I am by all means NOT a vegetarian, and I love meat -very much so!  I want to make this known, before taking the plunge.\n\nMy best friend and I have never before eaten at a vegetarian friendly restaurant.  Our expectations were low, I will admit.  I've been by this place many times, but never gave it the time of day.  We decided to take a deep breath, and pull up our boots, on the recommendation of another friend of mine.  This place quite simply blew our socks off.\n\nWalking in, there are three things you immediately notice.  One -this place is really clean, and well lit.  Two -this place is kind of small.  Three -the staff here is really friendly.\n\nWe ordered the Combination Platter (appetizer), Sweet & Sour Chicken, and the House Special Chow Mein.  \n\nThe \"combo-platter\" was delightful.  I was almost afraid to see what these meat imitating foods would taste like.  I now have a new found respect for soy products, yams, and wheat gluten.  Divine.  The flavors of all the different foods on this platter contrasted exceptionally well with one another -this actually applies to all of the dishes we ordered.\nFor two adults, I would recommend getting the large platter, instead of the small.  A nice preview of what was to come.\n\nSweet & Sour Chicken.  It also came adorned with carrots, and green bell peppers.  The carrots were nice and soft, not to be mistaken for mushy.  The bell peppers (which I normally don't eat) were fantastic.  At many other chinese restaurants, the bell peppers tend to be soggy with a drowned out taste.  But not here!  These bell peppers were done right.  Still slightly stiff/crunchy.  You benefit from the original taste of the bell pepper, AND the sweet and sour sauce.  I'd give it three thumbs up, unfortunately I only have two ;)\n\nHouse Special Chow Mein.  This dish was prepared better than any chinese restaurant I have been to.  The chow mein here was not bland in taste, and not lathered in oil and grease.  It went down easy, and had great taste!  The combination of mushrooms, vermicelli, bean sprouts, and others ingredients made for a mad flurry of outrageous flavor.  \n\nFor dessert you choose between papaya soup, or oranges.  Curious to see how the soup was, we went for it.  It was great.  It had fresh papaya, almonds, and and another ingredient I didn't recognize.  My friend doesn't like papaya fruit, but this soup turned him around and gave him a smack in the bee-hind!  Perfection in a bowl boys and girls.  Perfection.\n\nSo for two people, it ran us $26 plus tip.  The prices are a little higher than at say, some other places to dine for similar foods, but only by a couple dollars, really.  Definitely worth a try -I am positive you will not be let down.\n\nThe staff was very nice, and very accommodating.  As a quick aside however, this place is small.  Almost cramped -but still cozy.  Go there early to get a table.  Also parking isn't exactly ideal; I had to circle the block a couple times.  No parking lot, just street parking.  \nVegetarian or not, ch-ch-ch-check it out, and ENJOY VEGETARIAN!\n\nThis place will definitely see me again, and they definitely have my patronage.  If I go somewhere to eat and I am \"just satisfied,\" it is really only four stars to me.  In order for any place of business to get a five star rating from me, they need to exceed the standard.

Friendly staff.  No dinner combinations.\n\nI was looking for a healthy dinner while trying to wait out traffic before heading home, and yelp led me here.  I am a meat eater (steaks as bloody rare as possible), but after trying the amazing vegetarian soul food over at Souley Vegan in Oakland, I am no longer opposed to trying more meat free options.\n\nThe menu is very extensive, and it was hard to believe that everything offered wasn't real meat.  I wanted to try a few different imitation meats, but unfortunately there didn't seem to be any combos offered for dinner.   I went with the Salt and Pepper Fried Squid ($6.99), the Shanghai Bean Curd Sauce Braised Lamb with Dried Bean Curd & Vegetable ($8.50), and the House Special Chow Mein with BBQ Pork and Veggie Ham ($7.50).\n\nThe squid came quickly, and it looked just like fried calamari!  Quite impressive on the visual, but I was sure there was no way it could taste right.  After my first bite, I knew I would never doubt good vegetarian restaurants again.  It was delicious!  It had the exact same texture as squid (slightly rubbery and slippery) and the taste was on point too!  The waitress told me it was made out of yam, but it must have been some kind of yam I had never had before.  Amazing!  I wolfed the rest down.\n\nNext came the chow mein.  After the squid I was very excited to see how the bbq pork turned out, but it wasn't quite as good an imitation.  Visually it was spot on, but it definitely didn't taste much like bbq pork.  Not that it was bad, it was still very good, you could just tell it was made with tofu and maybe some mushroom.  Tasted very much like traditional chow mein with less oil.\n\nThe braised lamb... insanity.  It looked dead on like meat, and tasted like meat.  It didnt quite have the full lamb flavor, but it definitely tasted like meat.  The texture was dense and a bit chewy, spot on.  Excellent dish.  All the veggies were fresh, flavors crisp and distinct, just the right amount of salt.  I ended up bringing some of it to work the next day, and a couple of my coworkers tried it and couldn't believe it wasnt really meat.\n\nOverall, the meal was excellent.  It was very satisfying, and somehow healthy AND enjoyable.  What makes things extra crazy is they dont use ANY garlic or onions here, in any dish.  Those are my two favorite things to add in everything I cook, but somehow they can pull it off.

This philosophy also adheres to the strict Buddhist vegan diet, where it is believed that garlic and onion (for example) stirs up unwanted things in the body (or provide un-necessary bloodflow to the nether regions).\n \nBah, so it's gonna taste flavor-free or shideous, you are probably thinking.\n\nWell you'll be mildly surprised. SF Bay Area folks have got it good. You can go low tech and make your own salad at home with certified organic produce from your upscale farmers market (or Trader Joe if you're on the el cheapo). Or if you feel like spending green to eat green, there's Millenium, Greens, and of course Ubuntu, and a myriad of other raw food slow food type choices.\n\nBut if you are of the A$N per$ua$ion, it's slim pickins for Vegetarian Chinese, unless you're a member of a Buddhist temple. Lucky Creation in Chinatown is an excellent place, but it's a different niche, a bit more downscale Cantonese vegetarian that does more stir fry. Ming's on Taraval offers great vegetarian versions of Canto dishes, but they share the same kitchen that serves meat and seafood. There's really no good Taiwanese vegan/vegetarian around, and Sogo Tofu in San Jose is not even a restaurant. R&G Lounge's vegetarian/soy abalone is like $18, but that's one dish, and you don't know what's in their magic sauce, as good and as overpriced it may be.\n\nThis is where Enjoy comes in. Even volunteers and members of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (NorCal chapter, out of Taiwan) swear by this place (I know, because they directed us here!)\n\nAs much as I wanted some starch and bovine in soup at San Tung, an overdose of meat products earlier in the week required a change of pace for this one meal, and EV was pretty much the no brainer.\n\nEV is run by Hong Kongers and is more or less considered Vegetarian Cantonese, despite the menu having vegetarian versions of American Chinese, Sichuan, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hakka Cantonese. You may find similar things as your local PF Panda Chow, but why go there?\n\nHere we go:\n\nCombination platter (all made in house items) - $6, not good value at all for such a small portion\nsoy goose - not bad. But not as decadent as some Shanghainese restos\nsoy chasiu - eeeehhhh, why bother. A hint of sweet and sour. Why not use molasses or honey like the real porker?\ntofu strips (dou-gan) - I've had better\nsweet and sour wheat gluten - good gluten texture, but sweet and sour sauce was not so good.\n\nDrumstick with sweet and sour sauce - the worst item of the evening. Do not get this thinking that it tastes like fried chicken. I'm sure those soy hot dogs taste a whole lot better. The SS sauce didn't help either. The soy drumstick we had at a friend's wedding at a Vietnamese Buddhist temple in San Jose easily blew this one away.\n\nBean Curd Rolls w/vegetable (stuffed with cabbage and mushroom) - this is #90 on the menu. NOW WE ARE TALKIN' AND BACK ON TRACK. A tad bit too salty, but this is truly authentic good Cantonese, even if entirely vegetarian. Supposedly 101 through 104 are also very good (those with mushroom dishes). This plate saved the entire meal. $8.50, but very well executed\n\nSpinach and pine nut fried rice (#120 on the menu) - most folks get the House Special Fried Rice, but this was off the beaten path, and it ended up being very tasty. How did they do it? Not greasy at all, and yet quite flavorful. No MSG, no garlic, no butter, no Benihana grill, what was the formula? I could only guess, maybe mushroom powder essence for flavoring. The major drawback....lots of inconsistent undercooked grains of rice (or old rice). But this was easily solved by pouring #90 dish's magic sauce over the rice.\n\nVegetarian won ton with mixed veg udon - would not have ordered this otherwise, but if you have a kid who didn't like the soy fried chicken and prefers noodles, this might save the day. Just as I had guessed, a mushroom based broth. The wontons had finely minced up veg and tofu inside. Overall a very forgettable bowl, but palatable. I was lamenting paying $8 for this, when I could have spent it on THIS\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTNzezUyNYw\n\nFree plate of very juicy and sweet oranges when we got the bill.

However, by the end, the place was packed and the two large lazy susan tables were full.\n\nStarted out with the hot and sour soup, very good, just like your regular Chinese restaurant; this is the few rare times that I actually like bamboo shoots.

This was a very light and fresh dish, I went to town on it.\n\nThe Curry tofu, not a fan of at all.  I like the tofu they used, that really firm kind that has a robustness about it but that was it.  I thought the sauce was a little too thick and goopy, I had to scrape the excess curry sauce from my tofu chunks.  Another downer, our clay pot bowl was chipped so I ended up chewing on a piece of ceramic pot that got mixed in with the food.  Not pleasant.  However, the wait staff was extremely apologetic about it, offered to give a new dish of something else (we just asked for it to be put in a new bowl) and they comped us for the dish.  \n\nAll in all, very good, minus a star cause of the ceramic episode but don't let that deter you.

My fallback vegan restaurant tends to be Golden Lotus in Oakland's Chinatown -- close to home -- but GL has a Vietnamese bent, and sometimes I just want my Chinese classics.  Enjoy Vegetarian has solid Chinese classics like Hot and Sour Soup (sans egg), Kung Pao (faux) Chicken, Lettuce Wraps with (faux) Chicken and Pork.\n\nPoint for point, Golden Lotus has been a more delicious restaurant over the years.  My reservation with Enjoy Vegetarian is that -- like so many other vegetarian restaurants in this class (the now-closed Bok Choy Garden and perhaps the also-closed Layonna as well), it doesn't use garlic or onion.  Golden Lotus does.  There is an element of aroma as well as flavor that is missing from food that does not contain garlic greatness or onion awesomeness.  It's certainly a clean taste -- no MSG either (thank god) -- but could be elevated with the addition of those bulbous beauties I love so much.\n\nThat said, there is much to like about Enjoy Vegetarian.  EV has a Hot & Sour Wonton Soup, and I have to admit that EV's wontons are the best I've had at any vegan restaurant (even better than GL's).  They are the most authentic, most satisfying wontons in the business.  The lettuce wraps are fantastic.  You can't get Kung Pao at GL or several other Vietnamese-leaning places (including Golden Era), so it's nice to have those classic options as well (though, as of yet, I haven't tried the Kung Pao because I've been too intrigued by other Chinese dishes that I can't get elsewhere.  I've also feared that such missionary-position standards might disappoint whereas some of the more creative dishes, at least up to now, haven't).\n\nEnjoy Vegetarian always seems to be busy, and part of that is because I'm typically going on a Sunday.  On my last visit, my wait was uncomfortably long because there were several large families consuming space in the dining room for lengthy periods even after their meals were complete.  One of the families who was sitting next to us, we discovered, were related to the family who owns Enjoy Vegetarian.  Given the traffic and the wait times at such a peak Sunday hour, I found that curious.  The restaurant is so small -- seats, perhaps, 30 people at most -- why would a table for eight spend 2-1/2 hours in primetime?  They didn't even pay (which is how we discovered their relation).  Be forewarned:  there are a lot of larger families who eat there, and seating for small tables of 2 or 4 are limited.\n\nAnother time, I arrived at 2:20p for lunch (they allegedly close at 2:30p), and they refused to serve me.  So, I wouldn't expect to order if one technically arrives close-to-but-before the closing hour, as it seems that they start winding down a bit before the posted times.  This is not to say that the restaurant is empty, but rather, they don't want to start cooking or taking new orders near those posted times.\n\nParking near Enjoy Vegetarian can be tough.\n\nThe three-star review is a combination of the hassle factor with Enjoy Vegetarian combined with the lack of onion and garlic.  I wish the restaurant were bigger.  I wish it were easier to get in-and-out of.  I wish the wait times were shorter.  If so -- even with the same food -- I'd probably give it four stars.

Either that or they're paying people to write good reviews. (For example, just take a look at \"Rick A's\" review from June 2013:  Says he lives in LA, says this restaurant is \"in his neighborhood,\" along with stores in other cities, cannot speak English, profile has some sort of multilevel marketing company in Bangladesh.  Or \"Jeneva L's\" review from September 2013: Says she lives in San Jose, reviews of surf shops in SF, San Diego, phone store in SF West Portal, a mover in Norwalk, a mechanic in Huntington Beach, can't speak English more BS reviews).\n\nI cannot think of any other explanation for all these good reviews.
