The tuna itself was perfectly prepared.)\n- 7-hour braised shoulder of lamb with truffled mashed potatoes (The lamb fell apart when I looked at it, and the mashed potatoes were creamy. Delicious.)\n\n---\n\n- Chocolate fondant with whipped cream (This is what it says on their current menu on their Web site, but it was more like a chocolate lava cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Warm chocolate oozed out of the center of the cake. This was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and I usually always opt for the vanilla or fruit option.)\n- Apple tartin (Subtle flavor. In a dessert match, I felt that the chocolate fondant pummeled the apple tartin.)\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of \"Friendly Wine,\" which was the Argentinian Malbec. A little spicy, which we all enjoyed. Still easy to drink without overpowering the meal.\n\nOur server was attentive, yet also didn't make us feel rushed.

My portion was small, with a salad.  The club sandwich was just that, plus pommes frites (which our kid loved!).  My husband mentioned they put too much mayo.  We left quite unsatisfied with the food.  \n\nWent to the park and on the way home picked up a sandwich (part two of my brunch) at Blue Fog.  \n\nOn the walk home my husband mentioned he felt sick, but we kept walking the 20 minutes.  When he got home he laid in bed shivering and going to the bathroom.  From 4-10 PM, we had the heat on way high in the house and he kept going to the bathroom.  Finally at 11 I awoke to him vomiting his guts out.  Four times.  After that, he felt much better.  Told him he should just have forced himself to do that when we first got home.\n\nHe got food poisoning from the food there, we think.  And I wouldn't be surprised it was the mayo because he had mentioned there was too much of it and he didn't like how it tasted.  Though we are not certain Chouquet's was the culprit, we were not happy with the portion and taste of the food so we will not return.  It is unfortunate because I would have liked to return without the baby to try other stuff on the menu.  \n\nC'est la vie.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["They have lots of omelette selections.
