No dried water marks on the serveware or glass cups. No visible stains on the table clothes or chairs. All around, it just looked clean. \n\nCustomer Connection (4/5): We got seated right away. Welcoming greeting. The server probably had around 5 tables (and it kept increasing as we sat there) so I totally understand he was quite busy. Speed of service was okay; but, I wasn't expecting quick service. The thing that stood out the most for me in terms of connection was the server's genuine option between two salads I was debating on ordering.

Here, the noodles are served separately from the meatballs and fish sauce.  It was a revelation in flavor to eat.  \n\nOther dishes to order:\n\nCh gi\u00f2 - Vietnamese fried imperial rolls.  These should NOT be confused with the spring rolls in which the rice paper is not fried.  You get three to an order.  The imperial rolls are cut up into smaller pieces.  The traditional way to eat these is to wrap them up in the lettuce provided and pile on the fresh herbs and noodles - almost like you're making a lettuce wrap.  Not a lot of places serve it this way. Love it!\n\nFrog Legs - found them to be a bit on the dry side, but still not bad.  They are deep fried. The jalape\u00f1o dip served with it really helped brighten it up. \n\nHu Tieu - BEST I have ever tasted!  The garlic-infused chicken broth was AMAZING and tasted so clean and fresh.  Perfect for a cold winter day. \n\nBun Bo Hue - probably the only miss that I've tried so far.  Something about it just tasted off.  \n\nThe Pork Chop rice plate - probably the juiciest pork chop I've ever had at a Vietnamese piece.  Must get!\n\nI wanted to try the Hue Rolls and Cream Puffs, but they ran out.  Will definitely be back to try it and all the other dishes.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-12-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Their Hue Rolls are delicious and I think you should try this.

My boyfriend and I were still seated within 10 minutes, which was a good start. But after being seated with menus, we waited around 15-20 minutes without any water before a server came by, and even then, it was only because we flagged him down. After ordering, we still didn't receive any water until we reminded the server again, another 15 minutes later. 30 minutes without so much as a glass of water...kind of ridiculous.\n\nThe Hue Rolls we ordered as an appetizer came out fairly quickly and were super flavorful and fresh. Amazing starter that I'd definitely recommend. They were great with the chili sauce, which I had to swipe off an empty table since service was already nonexistent at this point, with no one coming by to check on the table.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bun Thit Nuong as his entree, but they forgot to bring the sauce that it's supposed to come with. Again, we had to ask a server for it. It tasted great...after the unnecessary additional wait for the sauce. I had the Bun Bo Hue, which was noodles and beef in a spicy lemongrass chicken broth. I didn't think it was as spicy as I was expecting and wanting it to be, but I still really enjoyed it. \n\nAfter finishing our meal and asking the person that cleared our plates for the check, we waited for the check...and still no check. Once again, we had to ask for it again. Then another unnecessarily long wait before they picked the check back up with the card. \n\nThe shitty service would've been kind of more acceptable if the restaurant was packed during our entire meal, but they were winding down and preparing for closing towards the middle and end of our meal...during which the service was still terrible. This seems to be somewhat of the norm, since other reviewers have mentioned that the service is a hit or miss.\n\nOverall, great food with god awful service.

I'm a cook and she's a server so we understand that it sucks to have last minute customers.  We wouldn't have gone inside so late if there were not people eating.

I'm sorry... I guess they didn't make it.  let me check with the kitchen.\"  when he left I told my wife that the pork should be on the side and I'm surprised that he doesn't know anything about his menu.

I wanted the regular thin pho noodles.  at this point I was super upset and he came back with the lemongrass pork and he was excited to drop it off....\" here it is!  they did make it for you.\"   was it really that fucking hard?  thanks for doing me such a big favor.  my wife started to tell him about the noodles but I just said forget it... its late... let just eat and get the hell out of here.  \n\nI tipped him a big fat zero...

Mau however was pretty good. The food is fresh and flavorful. With a few tweaks it could be really great. \n\nLet me focus solely on the food. I'm judging from the standards of traditional Viet cooking. There are of course other standards but this seems most useful, because Yelp is generally awash with uninformed opinions about Viet and other ethnic minority foods. I would only ever write about food I know intimately.  \n\nB\u00fan b\u00f2 hue: 3.5 /5\n\nSome good things here: the beef shank is tender; noodles are thick with a good chew; the broth has the right whiff of fermented shrimp paste and a good kick to it. \n\nBut....   the broth, savory as it is, could be better. B\u00fan b\u00f2 is lemongrass beef soup; the lemongrass should be abundant, bracing and aromatic. But here it was subdued. The broth also needed some acidity to balance it; in Vietnam this usually involves some combination of lime, tamarind, and/or pineapple (which adds a sweet-tart with the added bonus of enzymes that tenderize the meat). Some of the toppings were also incorrect. Sliced eye round steak is for ph, not b\u00fan b\u00f2. Same with thai basil; its anise-like notes goes with the star anise in ph broth but not with b\u00fan b\u00f2. Also, you will not find b\u00fan b\u00f2 places in Vietnam serving lettuce as a garnish. The typical herbs include rau r\u0103m, red onions, and thinly sliced banana blossom. It's odd that they have banana blossom in one of their salads but don't serve it with their b\u00fan b\u00f2.   \n\nHue rolls: 4/5\n\nThe pork was flavorful and juicy; the herbs, greens, and rice noodle sheets were fresh. It would be even better if there were some lime and chilies in the fish sauce to balance out the overall flavor profile which was a little too one-note sweet. \n\nSo overall pretty good.

We didn't have tons of time but we had an hour to have lunch before Ian needed to head out for SFO. Plenty of time, right? Especially for lunch at 1:45, when any sort of lunch crowd would have passed, yes? But, not quite. \n\nIt all started okay. We were seated quickly, and given menus and water promptly. But, then it took ten minutes for our waitress to come, even after the bus boy said he'd send her over. We considered walking out. She was friendly, thanked us for waiting, took our order (bun rieu for me, tofu bun and Vietnamese-style limeade for him, and veggie hue rolls for us), brought out the limeade (which was too sweet, with undissolved sugar crystals hanging out at the bottom of the glass and lacking all tartness), then we waited. And waited. \n\nI looked at my watch: 2:15. Nothing. We thought about leaving again. Other people who were seated after us had their food brought out to them. I must have made a face because our waitress then came over to apologize that our appetizers (the hue rolls) were brought to another table. She'd bring over a new plate immediately and take it off our bill. No problem but we're in a rush, we told her. We had a flight to catch. Okay, she'd bring our bill. \n\nThe hue rolls came out instantaneously, and they were good. The steamed rice wrapper was chewy in a good way. The lettuce added a light crunch. The sauce that came with it was not overwhelming like some fish sauces can be. And, that chile sauce with the chile flakes in it (which we had to ask for) is spicy, numbs your lips spicy, even for me, the girl who grew up with the Sriracha founders as her neighbors -- so, watch out, you just need a little. But, I think it what really made the dish was the shiso. Love shiso. \n\nAnd, the waitress brought our bill, with the hue rolls removed from the tab. Great. \n\nThen we waited some more. Our plates were taken away. Our waters will filled. We waited. We considered leaving again, but we needed to eat and, really, how much longer could it be? I was getting antsy. The busboy's movements (his clanging of the dishes), the dance club bass beats of the background (rather, foreground) music, watching all our dining neighbors eating their bowls of noodles (possibly our noodles), the fact that it was approaching 2:30 and our meals were still not in front of us, all of it made me anxious. \n\nA man (not sure who he was, as he wasn't a waiter nor the busboy, perhaps the owner?) took our credit card. \"Excuse us, our food hasn't come yet. We're in a rush -- we have a flight to get on -- so we wanted our check early. But, we've been waiting for nearly forty minutes.\" \"Forty minutes?\" He seemed embarrassed and was really apologetic. He said he'd see what was going on. He came back a minute later and apologized: they have a new busboy, who was trying to help out but brought our dishes to other people instead. \"But, he brought our hue rolls to someone else too.\" \"Oh, you were that table. I'm so sorry. This is the fifth time he's done that this week. I'll get your food out right now and take it off your bill. And, I'll check in with you guys to make sure everything's okay.\" \n\nAnd, all that happened. Our noodles came out two minutes later. The man gave us a bill for $0. Our waitress came over, apologized, and offered us another limeade, which we declined. The man asked if we needed anything, more limes maybe? The man gave us napkins, which we didn't ask for or need but I do like having extra napkins. The man offered us more limeade -- on the house -- which we still said no to. He was trying. \n\nAs for our noodles, they were pretty delicious. Sure, Ian's bun bowl with tofu and shitakes isn't like anything you'll find on Larkin Street but it was flavorful and filling, with plenty of tofu and veggies (though he did say that my lemongrass tofu is better). And, yeah, I'd choose to eat my mom's bun rieu over Mau's any day. But, if I'm feeling a craving for home, I'd totally eat that bowl of bun rieu again. \n\nSo, in summary, the food (at least what we ordered) is good. As the daughter of Chinese/Vietnamese immigrant parents, I'd eat here again. I wouldn't take my parents here of course, as they would say it's too expensive (maybe a few dollars more than what you'd find at a hole-the-wall, green-chopsticks-on-the-table sorta Vietnamese joint, but not expensive either) and my mom can make all this food herself and do it well, but I'd eat here with friends. \n\nAs for the service, they're trying. If the staff wasn't so genuinely apologetic to us and if we hadn't had our meal comped, I would be irate; I'd never go there again. But, they realized their mistakes, they apologized, and they tried to make up for it -- I can respect that. \n\nSo, three stars for food quality. And, an initial one star for having delivered all our food to other people and being slow plus the five stars of trying to make up for it, averages out to 3 stars for service.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Their appetizers (we had the garlic greens and the Hue Rolls) were wonderfully flavored.

Since my first run in, I've been to this place a few more; huge win for me in the Mission area. \n\nWhen you walk in, you're pleasantly surprise as it's not your typical Vietnamese \"mom and pop\" joint. Nice ornate chandeliers, lots of wood work, exposed kitchens; the makings of a fun hip place! The staff was super nice and helpful; wait wasn't too long in all accounts. The tables were strategically places so you didn't necessarily feel like you were sitting on top of your neighbors. \n\nWhen you visit, be sure to get the Mau drink for $9: ginger infused soju, ginger beer and lemon. It's a very summery-type cocktail, not strong, easy to the tongue. I love the ginger tone you get with this drink. For our appetizer, I ordered the spring rolls for $8. This is THE BEST spring rolls I've had. Ever. Let's start with the fact that the spring rolls are at least double the size than other restaurants. So big, they cut them in 3 pieces. With two whole rolls, you get 6 mini rolls, easily able to be shared amongst a small party. In it was poached shrimp and pork, vermicelli noodles, mint and served with a peanut sauce. I LOVE the ratio of filler and protein. Such a filling app. HIGHLY RECOMMEND that!\n\nFor the few times I've visited, I've gotten two types of dinners worth discussing. First, the Pho Bo for $10.50. I feel like you can't go to a Vietnamese joint and not get pho. In my pho, they had rare eye of round, brisket, rice noodles and other veggies in a broth. I LOVED the broth; so rich and full of body. Sometimes I get pho somewhere and the ratio of bean sprouts and noodles are off. Not here. Lots of noodles to fill you up; in fact the bowl was big as it is and filled to the top with things. LOVED IT. Another dish I would highly recommend is Is the Pork Shoulder Rice Plate for $11.50. Grilled thin pork, lemongress, shallots, garlic and served with picked veggies, rice and fish sauce. I'm just in love with this dish. They give you so much food! I had another meal with my leftovers. Pork was perfectly grilled and the fish sauce really enhance the flavor. \n\nOverall, such a major win for Mission. This place is on point, the staff, the food the ambience.

I'm torn because the garlic chicken broth and the pho were really really good. But the chicken itself was way too tough, and surprisingly dry, despite it soaking in the broth. The xia-xiu pork is really good and makes up for the lack of moisture in the chicken.

I recommend getting this.\n - Bun rieu (crab/shrimp tomato noodle soup) - Not very authentic, but flavors are there. Was also a bit too salty.\n - Bun thit nuong with imperial rolls \"noodle salad with marinated pork\" w/ fish sauce - also pretty good and tasted authentic. The meat and imperial rolls are served on a bed of cold rice noodles and lettuce, would've been better if the noodles were hot or at least warm.\n - Goi ga ( chicken cabbage salad appetizer) - non-conventional ingredients but tasted authentic. \n\nYou can expect Mau to be very busy during dinner on a weekday and lunch and dinner on a weekend. The wait is usually not too bad. My only problem with Mau is the lack of service when they are very busy... perhaps they are under staffed? During one of my many visits to this restaurant, my bf and I waited almost an hour for our noodle bowls to come out and our weekend lunch ended up taking almost 2 hours... The owners were really apologetic and kind, so we weren't angry about the lack of service, we were just kind of disappointed.\n\nDespite that negative experience, we did return and we do plan on eating here regularly in the future. It looks like the service is improving, so I'm quite happy about that.\n\nOverall, Mau is a great Vietnamese-fusion restaurant to grab a casual meal. The portions are large and the prices are good ($8-15).

It's rare to find a Viet place with a decent wine last and killer cocktail menu.\n\nMau has a mix of Southern & Northern Vietnamese dishes, some of which I've never even tried before like the Northern Bun Cha Hanoi which has now become one of my favorite dishes.  Here, the noodles are served separately from the meatballs and fish sauce.  It was a revelation in flavor to eat.  \n\nOther dishes to order:\n\nCh gi\u00f2 - Vietnamese fried imperial rolls.  These should NOT be confused with the spring rolls in which the rice paper is not fried.  You get three to an order.  The imperial rolls are cut up into smaller pieces.  The traditional way to eat these is to wrap them up in the lettuce provided and pile on the fresh herbs and noodles - almost like you're making a lettuce wrap.  Not a lot of places serve it this way. Love it!\n\nFrog Legs - found them to be a bit on the dry side, but still not bad.  They are deep fried. The jalape\u00f1o dip served with it really helped brighten it up. \n\nHu Tieu - BEST I have ever tasted!  The garlic-infused chicken broth was AMAZING and tasted so clean and fresh.  Perfect for a cold winter day. \n\nBun Bo Hue - probably the only miss that I've tried so far.  Something about it just tasted off.  \n\nThe Pork Chop rice plate - probably the juiciest pork chop I've ever had at a Vietnamese piece.

We didn't have tons of time but we had an hour to have lunch before Ian needed to head out for SFO. Plenty of time, right? Especially for lunch at 1:45, when any sort of lunch crowd would have passed, yes? But, not quite. \n\nIt all started okay. We were seated quickly, and given menus and water promptly. But, then it took ten minutes for our waitress to come, even after the bus boy said he'd send her over. We considered walking out. She was friendly, thanked us for waiting, took our order (bun rieu for me, tofu bun and Vietnamese-style limeade for him, and veggie hue rolls for us), brought out the limeade (which was too sweet, with undissolved sugar crystals hanging out at the bottom of the glass and lacking all tartness), then we waited. And waited. \n\nI looked at my watch: 2:15. Nothing. We thought about leaving again. Other people who were seated after us had their food brought out to them. I must have made a face because our waitress then came over to apologize that our appetizers (the hue rolls) were brought to another table. She'd bring over a new plate immediately and take it off our bill. No problem but we're in a rush, we told her. We had a flight to catch. Okay, she'd bring our bill. \n\nThe hue rolls came out instantaneously, and they were good. The steamed rice wrapper was chewy in a good way. The lettuce added a light crunch. The sauce that came with it was not overwhelming like some fish sauces can be. And, that chile sauce with the chile flakes in it (which we had to ask for) is spicy, numbs your lips spicy, even for me, the girl who grew up with the Sriracha founders as her neighbors -- so, watch out, you just need a little. But, I think it what really made the dish was the shiso. Love shiso. \n\nAnd, the waitress brought our bill, with the hue rolls removed from the tab. Great. \n\nThen we waited some more. Our plates were taken away. Our waters will filled. We waited. We considered leaving again, but we needed to eat and, really, how much longer could it be? I was getting antsy. The busboy's movements (his clanging of the dishes), the dance club bass beats of the background (rather, foreground) music, watching all our dining neighbors eating their bowls of noodles (possibly our noodles), the fact that it was approaching 2:30 and our meals were still not in front of us, all of it made me anxious. \n\nA man (not sure who he was, as he wasn't a waiter nor the busboy, perhaps the owner?) took our credit card. \"Excuse us, our food hasn't come yet. We're in a rush -- we have a flight to get on -- so we wanted our check early. But, we've been waiting for nearly forty minutes.\" \"Forty minutes?\" He seemed embarrassed and was really apologetic. He said he'd see what was going on. He came back a minute later and apologized: they have a new busboy, who was trying to help out but brought our dishes to other people instead. \"But, he brought our hue rolls to someone else too.\" \"Oh, you were that table. I'm so sorry. This is the fifth time he's done that this week. I'll get your food out right now and take it off your bill. And, I'll check in with you guys to make sure everything's okay.\" \n\nAnd, all that happened. Our noodles came out two minutes later. The man gave us a bill for $0. Our waitress came over, apologized, and offered us another limeade, which we declined. The man asked if we needed anything, more limes maybe? The man gave us napkins, which we didn't ask for or need but I do like having extra napkins. The man offered us more limeade -- on the house -- which we still said no to. He was trying. \n\nAs for our noodles, they were pretty delicious. Sure, Ian's bun bowl with tofu and shitakes isn't like anything you'll find on Larkin Street but it was flavorful and filling, with plenty of tofu and veggies (though he did say that my lemongrass tofu is better). And, yeah, I'd choose to eat my mom's bun rieu over Mau's any day. But, if I'm feeling a craving for home, I'd totally eat that bowl of bun rieu again. \n\nSo, in summary, the food (at least what we ordered) is good. As the daughter of Chinese/Vietnamese immigrant parents, I'd eat here again. I wouldn't take my parents here of course, as they would say it's too expensive (maybe a few dollars more than what you'd find at a hole-the-wall, green-chopsticks-on-the-table sorta Vietnamese joint, but not expensive either) and my mom can make all this food herself and do it well, but I'd eat here with friends. \n\nAs for the service, they're trying. If the staff wasn't so genuinely apologetic to us and if we hadn't had our meal comped, I would be irate; I'd never go there again. But, they realized their mistakes, they apologized, and they tried to make up for it -- I can respect that. \n\nSo, three stars for food quality. And, an initial one star for having delivered all our food to other people and being slow plus the five stars of trying to make up for it, averages out to 3 stars for service.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["My boyfriend had the Mi Xia Don (without the pork) and I had the Tofu Bun.

We ordered the quail appetizer based on our waiter's recommendation that it was an awesome dish. We ordered 2 for $12 as there were 2 of us and quails are notoriously tiny a delicate and tender meat.  What came out was 4 half pieces of quail  on top of a bed of watercress (or some similar green).  The quail was chopped in 2 and fried... and it was crispy, a bit charred (not burnt but seriously well done) and chewy similar to beef jerky in spots.  I was amazed when it came to the table that it was even served to us, it was obvious when it arrived that it was overdone.   I did give it  a chance and ate the first half. I couldn't taste any of the five spice that it was supposed to be flavored with bits of the charred skin flaked off and got all over the table.   At the second half (which was more meaty)  I decided to try and hunt for the succulent juicy meat that  I associate with quail.. The uncrispy meat literally could be fanned out ... dry and pointy.  In short .. if I served chicken wings to my guest that were this overdone I would be ashamed, it was probably the worst cooked quail I have ever had... and I do enjoy quail when it is done right.  If this were my first introduction to quail I would never order it again.\n\nTo make matters worse when our waiter (or busboy) came by to collect our appetizer dishes.. and my uneaten quail remained on the dish I mentioned that it was really overdone and I got a \"thank you\" in reply.    \n\nI did have a lovely light colored beer SpeakEasy The Witness (on tap) to wash down the appetizer.  The watercress was decent although one of those difficult items to serve and eat with chopsticks due to the long stems and small leaves.   \n\nFor dinner we each ordered the clay pot.  My friend got the fish $10 and I got the gulf prawns $14.   I'm not quite sure what I was expecting after hearing the waiter tell another table that the prawns were much more flavorful than the fish and he would recommend that dish over the fish by far.   \n\nWhat I received was 5 prawns iin the bottom of a clay pot with some sauce and spices.  I really think it was 5 shrimp (not prawns) .. they were about 2.5 inches (including the tail) and if they had  been straightened out might have been 3 inches from end to end. They weren't even particularly large for shrimp.  After the quail fiasco, I was really hoping they weren't overcooked.   The prawns were \"edible\"  not quite completely rubbery  but slightly overdone and a bit more chewy than you expect them to be served at your restaurant table.   It was kind of like the way prawns feel after you take them home and reheat them in the microwave the second night.\n\nAlong with my 5 prawns (that would easily fit in the palm of my hand)  came a bowl of rice on the side and a small dish with some bean sproutsetc.    Our chopsticks had been removed from the table with the appetizers and we each received a Chinese style ceramic soup ladle spoon for mixing and eating our dishes.   My friend's fish dish was pretty similar although her fish actually covered the bottom of her clay pot (the clay bowl was about 5 or 6 inches in diameter).  When she added her rice and her sprouts the bowl  had rice about an inch over the rim and she still had rice in the bowl.  When I added  my rice my rice sat about a half inch or more below the rim of my clay bowl.  My dish was actually pretty tasty, but I really don't think 5 average sized slightly overcooked shrimp and rice are worth the $14 price tag when the fish dish provides so much more food.  \n\nThey did bring out the house made siricha when we requested it and some lemongrass pickled hot spice.  Both of the house made condiments were quite tasty. We did have to request a spoon to go with the condiments.  Except for the shrimp portion of my dish I would give it a decent rating and even with the over cooked shrimp it was probably worth of a 3 out of 5 ... although not good enough for me to want to go back and try another dish. \n\nThe meal came to $50 total for 2 .. (a beer, a tea, an appetizer, and 2 clay pots) which I think was rather pricey for what we got although not a price to complain about. \n\nAs for the service it was interesting.   I was sitting against the wall and observing the other diners.  Dishes often came out and the servers weren't quite sure where to serve them .. we were nearly served the entrees for the table of 3 - 2 table down from us.  A table of gentleman on the other side of us were served an entree that they did not order - a bowl of pho rather than a plate of meat. By the time his correct plate arrived his companions were nearly finished with their meals.   Our meals were served correctly.   Although I found myself lacking in water at points in the meal,  I always had some liquid available to drink.  \n\nHopefully the service and cooking improve.

With two whole rolls, you get 6 mini rolls, easily able to be shared amongst a small party. In it was poached shrimp and pork, vermicelli noodles, mint and served with a peanut sauce. I LOVE the ratio of filler and protein. Such a filling app. HIGHLY RECOMMEND that!\n\nFor the few times I've visited, I've gotten two types of dinners worth discussing. First, the Pho Bo for $10.50. I feel like you can't go to a Vietnamese joint and not get pho. In my pho, they had rare eye of round, brisket, rice noodles and other veggies in a broth. I LOVED the broth; so rich and full of body. Sometimes I get pho somewhere and the ratio of bean sprouts and noodles are off. Not here. Lots of noodles to fill you up; in fact the bowl was big as it is and filled to the top with things. LOVED IT. Another dish I would highly recommend is Is the Pork Shoulder Rice Plate for $11.50. Grilled thin pork, lemongress, shallots, garlic and served with picked veggies, rice and fish sauce. I'm just in love with this dish. They give you so much food! I had another meal with my leftovers. Pork was perfectly grilled and the fish sauce really enhance the flavor. \n\nOverall, such a major win for Mission. This place is on point, the staff, the food the ambience. I REALLY like the fact that for an upscale nice joint, you aren't going to pay an arm and a leg for. If you're on Valencia, walk your happy butt to this joint and check it out.

Would I return?  Unlikely because nothing was spectacular.  There was a group of 9 of us & nobody was enthralled.  There are many other places to enjoy more flavorful, authentic & better priced Vietnamese food.  There aren't many competitors in the hipster Mission area so this place will probably do fine.

The spring rolls were pretty much the same bland thing I've had over and over again at other places, so nothing really new. Papaya salad was $8 and fresh, but come on...$8? \n\nI ordered the pork shoulder rice plate and it was very tasty, super filling...pretty good value for $9. \n\nHowever, the food took pretty long to get to my table. We had a modest table, of like 6 people...and having been the first to order my food came last, by at least 10 minutes. It was awkward for my friends who insisted on waiting to eat because my food didn't get there, their food was getting cold. I think they all ordered the various noodle bowls and said it was satisfactory. \n\nI guess overall what I'm trying to say is the price kind of reflects the location and ambiance of the place, and not necessarily the food.\n\nOtherwise the staff were nice and accommodating, but should get their timing better.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-04-01"}], "garlicsauteed greens of the day": []}
