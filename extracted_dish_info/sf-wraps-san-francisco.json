Lately I've been getting a lot of unsolicited comments full of spitfire and vitriol in my Yelp mailbox. My sister, Johnna S., said that nothing good ever comes in the Yelp inbox. She ain't never lied. My reviews are a play-by-play of my experience. That seems fair. You'll note, for the record, that the vast majority of my reviews are 4-5 stars. \n\nOne Friday afternoon I was craving the food of my people (half of my people, anyway), and decided to give SF Wraps a try. I was pretty busy, however, and needed to make quick work of lunch. I hoofed it to SFW and noticed that there were only a few people in line. Sweet. \n\nIt took a long time for me to place my order. I became confused, and I wondered if I was actually in the line. I asked the guy in front of me if he had ordered yet, because it seemed like an uncommonly long wait to place an order. He looked at me with annoyance and replied with a curt \"no.\" Okay, I admit that was annoying. Whoops. \n\nWhen it was my turn, I ordered a gyro lavash. There were only two people working at SFW that day. One was taking the orders and delivering them, and one was cooking. \n\nSFW is teensy, just like every other restaurant in the area. I parked myself at a table to wait, since everyone appeared to be ordering take out. \n\nA man came in and ordered after me. He sat at the table next to mine. And I'm fairly certain he was wearing purple contacts. Purple. Contacts (c. 1993). \n\nBecause I checked in on Yelp immediately upon my arrival, I was able to keep track of how long everything was taking. Of course, while I was waiting, my boss sent me 100 emails--I could just see his head spinning all the way around as he wondered if I had died during my lunch hour. I became antsy.\n\nIt took 20+ minutes to get a single wrap to go. Yikes--that's too long for takeout at lunch. SFW is a new business, so they may just need a little time to work out the kinks. Let's focus on the positive. \n\n+1 star for price. Another spot located in the FiDi where you can get a great lunch for under $10! My lavash was $7-$8--hurrah! \n\n+1 star for healthy fare and portion size. My gyro wrap was more gigantic than the Pixies' song. It was surprisingly light and healthy-full of leafy greens and evenly distributed gyro meat. I had one half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It was pretty tasty, to be sure. \n\nSFW is a solid spot, overall. The only problem is the wait. Just my opinion.
