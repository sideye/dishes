Soon as I got there, I placed my order. The service was surprisingly fantastic for a crowded dive bar. The bartender came right to us and kept an eye on us all night. (Caution: we were white males). \n\nThe totchos looked and smelt like the belly of the most beautiful pig on the planet. Honestly though, they weren't as incredible as I imagined them to be. I thought they would be seasoned or done up in some way, but they actually tasted like something a kid brother would make at 2am, but cost 8 dollars more (it also hurt my heart a little bit to pay 8 bucks for 12 tater tots.. bacon or not). \n\nThe saving grace, however, was the corned beef sandwich. That sandwich gave me liiiiife! Nearly perfectly cooked meat, with just the right amount of coleslaw to compliment it's flavor. Bread: nice and fluffy. And a nice bowl of broth to dip in. Simply succulent. \n\nGreat service, average bacon wrapped tater tots, and a fantastic corned beef sandwich at a bar in North Beach....\n\nSTRONG 4-star", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-05-12"}, {"excerpts": ["Best totchos in town.
