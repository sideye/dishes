As a full-disclosure, we know the owner's daughter at Thep Phanom. \n\nM E N U\nThe menu is extensive with many items you will not find at your typical King of Thai or OSHA Restaurants. HH Specials (Mon-Fri 5:30 PM-7:30 PM): $5 appetizers and $2 off all beer, wine and cocktails. All the food is made without MSG which is a HUGE plus in my book because I'm very sensitive to MSG. They also serve brown rice for the health-conscious. \n \nF O O D \nWhen it comes to ethnic cuisine, I prefer the most authentic and exotic dishes possible, so we asked the owner's daughter to order for us.  \n\n*THEP THONG: Deep Fried Chicken & Corn Balls (HH Special-$5, Regularly $8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=du0cRl7x3drCaOzqu5Di_A\nHot and crispy, the deep fried bags were filled with savory pieces of ground chicken and sweet tender corn. The Thai chili sauce added a nice sweet heat to the golden bags. \n\n*KOO GUT: Crispy Fried Yam & Taro w/ Peanut Sauce ($8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=kIZA0XE_AWNcFf7qsXSLiQ\nThick slices of the yam and taro were fried to crunchy crisp. I have a taro obsession, but I preferred the yam because it had a soft, tender texture with sweetness that went well with the savory, nutty peanut sauce. \n\n*CRYING TIGER: Spicy Grilled Beef Salad ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=dla3wZb7OTh-V0WntXw5bw\nThe grilled beef was wonderfully seasoned with prominent hints of garlic and ginger. The char from the grill added a nice smokiness and the vinaigrette gave a nice acidic punch to help balance everything out. \n\n*THE DANCING LADY: Grilled Jumbo Prawns Stuffed w/ Crab & Serves w/ Spicy Sauce ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=cx7YHZWrFMGTcnuL4wsDeQ\nHuge, succulent prawns generously stuffed with tender, sweet crabmeat. It was a simple dish, but the creative presentation, the seafood duo combo, along with the tangy, spicy sauce made for an exotic dish jam-packed with flavor. \n\n*TAMARIND FISH: Tilapia in Tamarind Sauce ($16.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=LWR6aQZOrkfduyKdOCx-xw\nThe tilapia was crisp on the outside and tender, flakey on the inside. It was coated with a sticky tamarind sauce which gave a subtle sweet and sour flavor that didn't overpower the delicateness of the fish. \n\n*PED TOD: Boneless Duck w/ Plum Sauce ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=7WuTdRtg1RPxpV6YZvdOug\nSimilar to a Chinese roast duck, the skin was ultra crispy; however, it was deep-fried which crisped the duck pieces all around the edges while still maintaining a tenderness inside. The duck was salty and savory with a hint of sweetness. The plum sauce added just the right amount of sweetness with an acidic layer to help cut through some of the richness. \n\n*BIRDS OF PARADISE: Chef's Famous Quail ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=AXddd23Uk9qIS87-D2vpfw\nPerfectly crispy on the outside, the quail still maintained a juicy, tenderness in the inside. I love that the wing was fried to a golden crunchiness which allowed me to devour the wing in it's entirety--crunchy goodness!\n\n*Homemade Cream & Espresso Creme Brulee\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=2ppCU4rbOe5eh6gJiuWlZQ\nThe homemade vanilla ice cream was rich and creamy with a delicate sweetness.

No, it wasn't the shiny Sinbad pants the waiters were obviously forced to wear, it wasn't the constant water refills, it wasn't the overall decor, it was the papier mache elephants that greet you when you walk in the door. I LOVE ELEPHANTS! They're my thing. I know it's rather elementary to be obsessed with an animal. For example, I was always totally freaked out by \"horse girls\" back in sixth grade. Dood! Get a life and stop braiding that Breyer Horse's tail!\n\nBut for real, elephants...did you ever know that you're my hero?\n\nBack to the wind chime reference....the ambiance of the place was set by the sounds of what seemed to be a CD of a band who plays chimes as their instruments. It was clinky, weird and not very pretty at all. \n\nWe were pretty ravenous coming into the place and were really let down by our crispy tofu with peanut sauce appetizer. The tofu was completely bland, as tofu is. But it needed more umph! And though the peanut sauce was good, it was a bit watery and needed more peanut flavor.\n\nThe Tom Kha Gai was delicious, but the servers seemed really intent on serving our food in courses. And I like my rice doused with a healthy serving of Tom Kha Gai. So we ate a bit of our soup and waited for our final dish and the rice to come. But they kept coming by and asking if we were done with the soup, or if we wanted it wrapped up. Or they would just come over and stare into our obviously unfinished bowls. I finally told them that we wanted our soup with the rest of the food.\n\nThe shrimp with chili paste and green beans was good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nI'll come back because it's ridiculously close to my apartment, but I've got to admit I wasn't overly impressed by the food. I did appreciate them being on top of the water, checking in to see that everything was ok, and promptly bringing us our bill.

Ok, to be honest, they're just average looking and everyone and their mom, even my mom, has one hanging in their yard. I prefer to hang mine indoors. Why, you ask? Because the sounds of those bitches clinking together is like nails on a freaking chalkboard or the continuous sound of the tape gun in the returns department at my work, which my office just so happens to be conveniently located next to.\n\nWhatever, the point is I find the charming touristy chimes to be obscenely annoying.\n\nBoyfriend and I decided to go out for Thai in my new hood and being the lazy, haven't-walked-more-than-two-blocks-in-a-year couple that we are, we chose Thep Phanom because it was two blocks from my new digs.\n\nRight away I fell in love with the place. No, it wasn't the shiny Sinbad pants the waiters were obviously forced to wear, it wasn't the constant water refills, it wasn't the overall decor, it was the papier mache elephants that greet you when you walk in the door. I LOVE ELEPHANTS! They're my thing. I know it's rather elementary to be obsessed with an animal. For example, I was always totally freaked out by \"horse girls\" back in sixth grade. Dood! Get a life and stop braiding that Breyer Horse's tail!\n\nBut for real, elephants...did you ever know that you're my hero?\n\nBack to the wind chime reference....the ambiance of the place was set by the sounds of what seemed to be a CD of a band who plays chimes as their instruments. It was clinky, weird and not very pretty at all. \n\nWe were pretty ravenous coming into the place and were really let down by our crispy tofu with peanut sauce appetizer. The tofu was completely bland, as tofu is. But it needed more umph! And though the peanut sauce was good, it was a bit watery and needed more peanut flavor.\n\nThe Tom Kha Gai was delicious, but the servers seemed really intent on serving our food in courses. And I like my rice doused with a healthy serving of Tom Kha Gai. So we ate a bit of our soup and waited for our final dish and the rice to come. But they kept coming by and asking if we were done with the soup, or if we wanted it wrapped up. Or they would just come over and stare into our obviously unfinished bowls. I finally told them that we wanted our soup with the rest of the food.\n\nThe shrimp with chili paste and green beans was good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nI'll come back because it's ridiculously close to my apartment, but I've got to admit I wasn't overly impressed by the food. I did appreciate them being on top of the water, checking in to see that everything was ok, and promptly bringing us our bill.

My Brother had frequented this place in the late 80's when it was 1/3 its current size (yes, it was THAT small).  THe place had grown to be one of most prized Thai place in the City.  My brothers, sister & I decided to come out here for dinner  one evening in 2000.   I was fortunate to have been able to witness the fine cuisine I was told about so much.  \n\n  Fast forward to tonight.  Although many of their dishes are unique and delicious (and the standards are good as well) it just wasn't the same eye-popping tongue-dancing experience I remembered in 2000.  I know the owners are still the same, because the owners know my brother very well.  We were given a very friendly welcome into the restaurant and the owners even gave us a few appetizers on the house!  The ambience is the same beautiful authentically decored mini palace as it was 7 years ago.  Their beef with basil was scrumtious and I also enjoyed the duck!  However, having the expectation I had from remembering my 2000 experience took one star from my rating Thep Phanom.  I would expect a reputable establishment like this to continue serving their food consistently over time.  But being that Thep Phanom holds a special place in my heart for the occassions I've been there with my brothers & sister should definately earn them two of the four stars.  The Thai food is authentic and delicious, but don't expect to be overly blown over, unless they come back to their original recipes.\n\nDishes we were served tonight:\n\n- Lemon Grass Salad - Chicken & Shrimp with cashew nuts, lemon grass, & spicy lemon dressing. ***\n- \"The Crying Tiger\" - Grilled Beef Salad with Spicy Garlic Dressing *****\n- Panang Chicken - ****\n- Nan Kruan (\" The Weeping Lady\") - Chicken with grilled eggplant garlic, chili, and basil. ***\n- Salt & Pepper Crispy Beef Strips - with cashews and crispy basil *****\n- Ped Sawan - Boneless duck in honey sauce over spinach. *****\n\n(the \"*'s\" were my star ratings for each dish).", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Our first entree was \"The Weeping Lady\" (Sauted minced chicken with grilled eggplant , garlic , chili and basil ) and it was amazing.

It actually may be the first Thai restaurant I had been to after I moved away from my parents' house for the final time. It was back in 1987, and I was a cherubic bean counter for a bank. A college friend of mine had told me his favorite restaurant was this place, so I went and have been coming back on an infrequent basis ever since. Obviously I hadn't been since 2006 because I never Yelped it before, which amazes me because I feel I know this converted Victorian spot so well. The staff is still as friendly as ever, so I took Jamie W. for his first time there. Sadly, it was as still as a tomb when we were there on a rainy Saturday afternoon.\n\nBossa nova-style covers of Michael Jackson's hits were wafting from the muzak. Some worked like \"Human Nature, others didn't like \"Beat It\". We went for three hearty dishes. First up was the $15 Sam Kasatr, one of my favorite of their specialty dishes, a combination plate of sauteed chicken, beef and pork with sliced bamboo shoots and seasoned with Thai spices (photo: http://bit.ly/28NEYPy). It went really well with their $16 Pineapple Fried Rice, quite a delectable sweet-and-savory treat served in a grilled half-pineapple with fried rice blended with yellow curry and mixed with shrimp, chicken, cashew nuts, raisin, onion and fried egg (photo: http://bit.ly/28Rmjpp).\n\nI've had variations at other Southeast Asian restaurants, and this one was up there. Our last dish was the $12 Pad Se Ew with Chicken, a Thai classic with pan-fried noodles with fried egg and broccoli in a thick soy sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/28ONY9O). All the food reminded me that Thep Phanom is like my late mom. Yeah, I'd forget to call her. Sure, I didn't come home when I told her I would so she could do my laundry. But she would make me some nice dinner anyway, even though she hated to cook beyond heating up the Toshiba rice cooker. I guess I should come back here more often, Mom.

It must have been all of the laughing that took it out of me, but I was ready to eat the pie pieces off the damn game board!\n\nAnd then it sunk in....I am a vegan for a month! What was I thinking?? I want a burger, I want a pulled pork sandwich, I want cheese fries and pizza and all of the stuff I can't have!! What am I going to do? What have I done? Why do people celebrate 420 anyhow?? Crap, why can't I have jalapeno poppers and a carne asada burrito? Would anyone know or care if I fell off the wagon (again)??\n\nWell, thank God that Barbara was here, and thank God she brought us all dinner from this Thai restaurant, and thank goodness she is also off the meat and brought things I can eat. It was good. In fact the tofu green curry was the best I have ever had!! Well, it is the only vegan green curry I have ever had, but let me tell ya, it sure tasted good.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-04-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I know what goes into a Green Curry or a Phad whatever.

My Brother had frequented this place in the late 80's when it was 1/3 its current size (yes, it was THAT small).  THe place had grown to be one of most prized Thai place in the City.  My brothers, sister & I decided to come out here for dinner  one evening in 2000.   I was fortunate to have been able to witness the fine cuisine I was told about so much.  \n\n  Fast forward to tonight.  Although many of their dishes are unique and delicious (and the standards are good as well) it just wasn't the same eye-popping tongue-dancing experience I remembered in 2000.  I know the owners are still the same, because the owners know my brother very well.  We were given a very friendly welcome into the restaurant and the owners even gave us a few appetizers on the house!  The ambience is the same beautiful authentically decored mini palace as it was 7 years ago.  Their beef with basil was scrumtious and I also enjoyed the duck!  However, having the expectation I had from remembering my 2000 experience took one star from my rating Thep Phanom.  I would expect a reputable establishment like this to continue serving their food consistently over time.

As a full-disclosure, we know the owner's daughter at Thep Phanom. \n\nM E N U\nThe menu is extensive with many items you will not find at your typical King of Thai or OSHA Restaurants. HH Specials (Mon-Fri 5:30 PM-7:30 PM): $5 appetizers and $2 off all beer, wine and cocktails. All the food is made without MSG which is a HUGE plus in my book because I'm very sensitive to MSG. They also serve brown rice for the health-conscious. \n \nF O O D \nWhen it comes to ethnic cuisine, I prefer the most authentic and exotic dishes possible, so we asked the owner's daughter to order for us.  \n\n*THEP THONG: Deep Fried Chicken & Corn Balls (HH Special-$5, Regularly $8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=du0cRl7x3drCaOzqu5Di_A\nHot and crispy, the deep fried bags were filled with savory pieces of ground chicken and sweet tender corn. The Thai chili sauce added a nice sweet heat to the golden bags. \n\n*KOO GUT: Crispy Fried Yam & Taro w/ Peanut Sauce ($8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=kIZA0XE_AWNcFf7qsXSLiQ\nThick slices of the yam and taro were fried to crunchy crisp. I have a taro obsession, but I preferred the yam because it had a soft, tender texture with sweetness that went well with the savory, nutty peanut sauce. \n\n*CRYING TIGER: Spicy Grilled Beef Salad ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=dla3wZb7OTh-V0WntXw5bw\nThe grilled beef was wonderfully seasoned with prominent hints of garlic and ginger. The char from the grill added a nice smokiness and the vinaigrette gave a nice acidic punch to help balance everything out. \n\n*THE DANCING LADY: Grilled Jumbo Prawns Stuffed w/ Crab & Serves w/ Spicy Sauce ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=cx7YHZWrFMGTcnuL4wsDeQ\nHuge, succulent prawns generously stuffed with tender, sweet crabmeat. It was a simple dish, but the creative presentation, the seafood duo combo, along with the tangy, spicy sauce made for an exotic dish jam-packed with flavor. \n\n*TAMARIND FISH: Tilapia in Tamarind Sauce ($16.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=LWR6aQZOrkfduyKdOCx-xw\nThe tilapia was crisp on the outside and tender, flakey on the inside. It was coated with a sticky tamarind sauce which gave a subtle sweet and sour flavor that didn't overpower the delicateness of the fish. \n\n*PED TOD: Boneless Duck w/ Plum Sauce ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=7WuTdRtg1RPxpV6YZvdOug\nSimilar to a Chinese roast duck, the skin was ultra crispy; however, it was deep-fried which crisped the duck pieces all around the edges while still maintaining a tenderness inside. The duck was salty and savory with a hint of sweetness. The plum sauce added just the right amount of sweetness with an acidic layer to help cut through some of the richness. \n\n*BIRDS OF PARADISE: Chef's Famous Quail ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=AXddd23Uk9qIS87-D2vpfw\nPerfectly crispy on the outside, the quail still maintained a juicy, tenderness in the inside. I love that the wing was fried to a golden crunchiness which allowed me to devour the wing in it's entirety--crunchy goodness!\n\n*Homemade Cream & Espresso Creme Brulee\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=2ppCU4rbOe5eh6gJiuWlZQ\nThe homemade vanilla ice cream was rich and creamy with a delicate sweetness. The silky smooth espresso cr\u00e8me brulee gave my taste buds a nice jolt with a sweet bitterness which was balanced with a crisp caramelized sugar crust.\n\nS E R V I C E\nFriendly and attentive but in a reserved manner.  Food came out relatively quickly and there wasn't much wait time between dishes. Each table was given a water bottle so you can refill your own water glasses which I prefer. \n\nA M B I A NC E / D \u00c9 CO R \nClassy, exotic, and quaint; Thep Phanom is perfect for date or a small group dinner.

You get the idea.  As all the ingredients here seem to be.  Oh yeah, and the curry had a refreshingly strong lemon grass aroma.\n\nAnd any place that would give out a free glass of wine for their anniversary is just cool.  The waiters and waitresses were really nice, and move really quickly, even when they were dealing with the one downside of our meal, the huge and rude birthday party of people who were so bad that no other patrons even chimed in to sing to the birthday boy.\n\nAnyway, we still cant wait to go back and save some room for the desserts because they looked awesome at the other tables.

It seemed that the drop in quality coincided with the removal of the specials boards from above the windows.

In December, we ordered a pair of our old favorites -- tom yum goong and crispy basil chicken -- plus salt-and-pepper beef, a new one for us. The soup was bland and unbalanced; the chicken, formerly blessed with a wispy crispy coating, now had a blatant battering; and the beef was interesting but not terribly Thai-flavored, and unpleasantly chewy. We chalked it up to a bad night, and didn't give it much thought.\r\n\r\nLast weekend, we went back with a couple of friends. We shared everything, so I had a chance to grasp the breadth of the problem:\r\n\r\nSom tam -- green papaya salad -- is typically blazingly hot and pungently tart. Thep Phanom's version was neither. The rather small portion was served in a cocktail glass.\r\n\r\nTom yum goong was dished out tableside into flat soup plates, rather than bowls. The broth was almost clear, not even a hint of redness from steeped shrimp shells or chiles. It tasted almost as bland as it looked: no hot, barely any sour, a paltry 4 shrimp for 4 people. \r\n\r\nLarb ped featured tasty grilled, chopped duck meat, but the rest of the dish was bizarre.
