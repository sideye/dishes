The woman making the food was someone we'd never seen before and was the only person behind the counter making food.  The only other person there was a man running the register who said he was the Manager.  She didn't know how to make the food we've been buying for years.  The burrito was rolled very loose and the sandwiches were not made according to their usual standards.  Mind you, we hadn't bought them yet.  We saw this by watching her make the food through the glass.\n\nShe didn't understand what we were asking her to do, like not put our lettuce on the hot grill to prevent wilting, or to make one spicy and the other not.  So we spoke to the \"Manager\", or attempted to anyway.  He ignored us, wouldn't acknowledge we were talking to him, until my husband got loud.  Then he proceeds to say \"it's just a sandwich\".  We argued that because we're customers paying for \"just a sandwich\", it should be made the way we want it, the way it's always been made in the past, citing hot lettuce as an example.  His response... \"lots of people do it that way\".   I was absolutely stunned that he didn't care the food wasn't being made according to their usual standards, or that the customer is saying it isn't right.  He absolutely did not care, stood there shrugging his shoulders and again said \"geez, it's just a sandwich, don't have a heart attack over it\".  \n\nMy response... I'm having a \"heart attack\" because you act like you don't care and that makes you look like an a@#hole that doesn't care about your customers.  He agreed he didn't.  with that said, we vowed to never return and made sure he knew he was loosing good, long time customers.  We'll never go back.  \n\nThe food is good, don't get me wrong.  But I can't spend my hard earned money in a business that could care less about the customer, and be so open with it.  He thought the food was fine, didn't care that the burrito would fall apart, or that the lettuce was served hot in a sandwich.  In his opinion it was fine and that's all there was to it.\n\nIt may be \"just a sandwich\", but it's that sandwich, and that burrito, and that taco that pays your bills buddy.  No customers, no money.  No money, no business.  It's simple.  Take care of your customers, especially those who've been with you for more than 20 years.
