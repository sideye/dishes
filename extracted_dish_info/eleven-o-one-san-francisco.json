We employed a variety of methods, including the compression technique, the open-faced solution, the careful-biting treatment, but many of us were forced to resign to the chopped sandwich salad fork and knife option. Regardless of ingestion method though, the food here is deeelicious! Yes, we did in fact brave the legendary C'est La Vie sandwich (mozz sticks, onion rings, AND calamari? not to mention every single type of animal product ever invented). It measured no less than 8 inches in height and measured no less than 9000 on the scale of holy foodgasmic. The Firecracker sandwich with spicy turkey was also a winner. Even the \"healthier\" veggie options are monstrous and keep you full for days. There's probably a tree-worth of avocados (they grow on trees right) in there. And as mentioned by others, Dutch crunch is the way to go.\n\nOther items of note: the sweet potato fries come with this sauce that is just sheer foodcrack. Smother it on everything. Drink it like heaven's mana. Garlic fries also mega winner. Also popcorn chicken. Also everything else that is fried and holy in this world.\n\nSmall cozy place to chill, cute seating, free wi-fi, moderate booze selection, no coffee. Service can be a little slow but that's 'cause they're preparing everything fresh-to-order, injecting it with tons of love, and probably sprinkling addictive drugs and hallucinatory substances into the mix, but hey, I'm not complainin' .", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["However, the 4 star review comes from the Firecracker sandwich.

I know that heat is not a common problem in San Francisco, and I hate being the one to complain about it, but there is nothing more thrilling than stepping into a business with air conditioning on a hot day. It really makes a huge difference in customer experience. \n\nI had the tree sitter sandwich and a kombucha. I did not like the sandwich. It was very eggy and drenched in sauce. I've also had better Dutch crunch bread so I'm guessing they do not source it locally. I will definitely be back to try some more sandwiches and try to have a better experience so I am not ruling this place out at all. \n\nOne of my complaints is that there really didn't seem to be enough vegetarian options. I don't recall any vegan options at all. There is definitely a need for an updated menu by cutting the less popular items, slimming down the menu, introducing some more specials, and definitely more veggie options.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the tree sitter sandwich because it was one of their veg options, and it just wasn't a great combination of flavors: mozzarella, honey mustard, hard boiled eggs?

The ingredients did taste fresh though (except maybe the Dutch crunch bread), and the sandwich was well constructed (structurally speaking). \n\nMore disappointing were the garlic fries I ordered. The fries by themselves would've been good, but when I ordered garlic fries I expected some garlic seasoning or maybe roasted garlic. Instead, there were spoonfuls of the pre-minced garlic you get in jars thrown on the fries, which didn't stick to them at all and caused them to become soggy and wet.\n\nOh well.
