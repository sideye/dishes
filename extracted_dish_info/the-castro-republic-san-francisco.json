Our delivery order was scheduled to arrive on Friday, September 28th between 11:30am and 12pm via Caviar. It didn't arrive until around 1:15pm, which means it was over an hour late. Not sure who's fault this was, but as a result, everything was lukewarm. Plus, they forgot an order of flautas, so someone at work went lunchless.\n\nTacos de la Republica: Your choice of meat or veggies, 3 tacos on organic corn tortilla, onion, cilantro relish, lime, and roasted tomatillo salsa ($12)\n*Beer Marinated Steak\n*Al Pastor\n*Adobo Chicken\n\nI adore tacos, so I figured this was a good way to sample a few. They all had pretty good flavor, but at $4 each, I found them kinda small. They were basically the size of a bigger street taco. Plus, they needed some salsa or something to give some of the meat moisture. I had some hot sauce at my desk, so I just used that. At least that gave them a little kick. A coworker ordered the plantains and hated them. And she loves plantains. Unfortunately, they ended up discarded. \n\nKind of a fail of a lunch order. My tacos were okay, but they were definitely not worth the wait. If you're hangry, don't order delivery from here. You'll be starving by the time it arrives.", "rating": 2, "date": "2018-10-02"}], "crispy chick sandwich": [], "tostaditas": [], "enchiladas de mole ponlano y crema": []}
