I noticed the \n     gratuity section showed the gratuity was based on the meal.  So I gave them my \n     credit card.  When I got the bill back to sign, the gratuity was higher because it  \n     was based on the total bill. \n4)  The soup was very bland.  The oxtail and the beef tongue were not cooked long \n     enough so they were tough.  My sons steak was good but for the price $18.50, it \n     was thin.  \n\nWe came here once (about two years ago) and thought it was much better then. We would not come here again.
