Unless I drive over there, it's a bit of a schlep especially if you're counting on the 12 to pick you up sometime in your lifetime. However, my friend Maggie took the advice of a colleague of hers and invited Jamie W. and me to dinner at this spot of which I was completely unaware. Trick Dog and Central Kitchen are just around the corner, but I didn't know this happening Thai eatery was attracting the young and hip all on its own.\n\nIt looked expansive when I first entered the empty restaurant, but it crowded quickly before we knew it. I got there first and ordered a $4.50 Classic Thai Tea just because I needed something refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/2fBnKd3). Once we sat at the table, I moved onto the even more refreshing $6.50 Whole Young Coconut, which is exactly what it was like I was on an episode of Gilligan's Island with the Howells. It even had a pink straw and matching umbrella (photo:  http://bit.ly/2fP2jCW). Maggie decided to get something with more of a kick and landed on a $9.50 Thai Cooler which mixed a lager with fresh pineapple juice, lime, and cane sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfssLK).\n\nWe decided to share our plates and started with the $12 Ahi Scoops, a quartet of appetizer servings combining pan-seared Ahi tuna covered in black sesame seeds, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam, dill, lemongrass, and chili lime (photo: http://bit.ly/2gwcZYe). Tasty bites with a nice contrast in textures, they were like maki rolls without the rice. We moved on to a $12 tureen of the popular Tom Kha, a luxuriant coconut soup with mushroom, tomato, galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, long coriander, and for $4 extra, fresh prawns (photo: http://bit.ly/2gJf06m). It was a lovely tropical broth that tasted creamy without having any cream in it.\n\nOur entrees came next with the recommended $18 Hat Yai Fried Chicken arriving first. It's a Southern Thai specialty that fries up a large chicken breast and adds fried shallots, turmeric, and other herbs in the coating. It came with a bowl of potato yellow curry, roti bread for dipping, and a scoop of intensely blue rice made from dok un sun (butterfly peas) (photo: http://bit.ly/2g2gAiz). The poultry was quite tender on its own, but the curry, rice and roti bread made it a more complete meal. The finale was the $22 Panang Neua, a large slow-braised, bone-in short rib with a Panang curry ladled over it.\n\nIt came with grilled broccolini, peppers, onion, fried basil, and more of that blue rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfzHmW). That was definitely a high point with the meat falling off the bone with ease with the curry providing extra punch. For dessert, an indulgence I know after all that food, we decided to splurge and get the $26 Ruk Na Platter, a somewhat overpriced potpourri of most of their specialty desserts - taro sticky rice, coconut creme brulee, choco cake, a caramel macaron, and a wedge of fresh seedless watermelon (photo: http://bit.ly/2fP7F0L). It was such a fanciful meal like we were in Koh Samui lounging next to the beach....only it's the Mission and I don't need sun block.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...creatively executed Thai dishes mostly flavorful, some a bit overdone\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...cavernous space feels casual like a beach club\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...polite but not overly informative\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Thai food for an eclectic palate, no pad thai allowed", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-11-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the classic Thai tea and an elderflower spritzer.

I came here several times with large groups because there's lots of tables and waiting is max 15-20 min (hard to find such places in SF). The restaurant has a fun, clean vibe. \n\nHere are my reviews in order of my favorite dishes.\n1. Hat Yai Fried Chicken - 100% will not regret ordering this. The serving can feed almost 2 people. The chicken is so juicy and crispy. So perfect with the sweet and sour sauce. The curry dip comes with yuka (first I thought they were potatoes) and slices of naan? platha? This part of the dish tastes very similar to Burma Love's platha dip which is my go-to appetizer. \n\n2. Grilled River Prawns Pad Thai - Is $20 pad thai really worth it? yes. The prawns are HUGE and so fresh. I love their pad thai although it can be a bit sweet for some people. Treat yoself to some expensive and darn good pad thai. \n\n3. Green curry with crispy pork belly - At first I totally judged this combination, but you need to try their crispy pork belly. I couldn't stop eating them. I like how their curry has a lot of vegetables. \n\nDishes I didn't like:\n- Papaya salad was way too spicy and too saucy \n- Tom Yum was also super spicy\n- Pad Kee Mao's noodles were too overdone\n\nI like their thai iced tea and honey milk lavender!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Collectively during both visits, we have tried their *Honey Milk Lavender, *Ginger Milk Tea, *Coconut Cream Latte, and *Rogue Hazelnut Brown beer.

Portions are decent and presentation is beautifully Instagram-worthy (when you see two big guys sitting at the next table taking picture of their food, you'd know what's up.) During my first visit, the BFF and I tried some of the dishes the lot raved so much about:\n*Hat Yai Chicken: The fried chicken breast was crunchy with decent flavor. The curry was flavorful but a bit on the sweet side. The roti, unfortunately, was hard and difficult to chew. We had to put each piece into the curry sauce to \"rehydrate\" them and it would still be difficult to eat. \n*24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup: The beef was fall-off-the-bone tender and very flavorful. Regrettably, the broth was awfully salty.\n*Ahi Scoops: Warning: super spicy chili sauce sitting right on top of the piece of tuna. I literally sat there for a good minute or two before I regain a little sense of my taste buds. I could barely taste any other flavor from the rest of the dish. Just be sure to have your water ready for it.\nThe second time around, my mum and I decided to try something different:\n*Daily special red curry with (something) prawns in half pineapple: We wanted to try a curry dish and the waitress was recommending it so we thought why not. It wasn't very impressive. Again, the curry was not spicy at all and rather sweet. The two giant prawns were somewhat undercooked and difficult to eat. Love the coconut rice though.\n*Pad Thai with Tofu: Decent and solid classic Thai street dish. Yum.\nWe also tried their *Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. They seemed to have combined black sticky rice with regular sticky rice so the consistency was pretty interesting in a good way. Love the fragrant sesame seeds as well.\n\nTheir drinks are pretty interesting too.

Super cute restaurants like Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Kitchen have taken residence along with multi-million dollar lofts that I will never be able to afford. But, that's gentrification for ya right?\n\nAt first glance, the prices at Farmhouse Kitchen may seem high for Thai food but they're justifiable. They use local and organic ingredients, and the portions are generous (enough for another meal). Plus, the presentation of every dish is instagrammable worthy - beautifully plated with vibrant colors that pop. \n\nAfter an offsite work meeting, I stopped by Farmhouse Kitchen for lunch. No need to peruse the menu as I knew what I wanted to order, the much raved about Hat Yai Chicken: Southern style fried chicken, yellow potato curry, roti, blue jasmine rice ($16): http://bit.ly/1VCfJUJ. The fried chicken breast had a satisfying crunch and was nicely tender. I immersed each piece into the curry sauce and wrapped the flaky roti around it to make a mini kati roll. The blue rice was just dyed rice. I had plenty of leftovers for dinner. When I ate the different components separately at dinner, I noticed that the chicken was sour (too much citrus in marinade?) and the curry dipping sauce was too sweet. This went unnoticed at the restaurant as curry sauce balanced out the sourness of the chicken. \n\nAlso, ordered their House Soda ($3.50) which was refreshing but a little too concentrated for my liking. Needed to be diluted a bit more. \n\nProps for the lightning fast service (received my order in 5 minutes) since I had to go back to the office but one of the servers had a bit of a diva attitude - an unspoken sass with his body language. \n\nMe: \"Hi!\"\nHim: \"Ready to order?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I like to order the...thank you!\"\nHim: *flips hair*\n\n*Server places check on the table*\n\nMe: \"Thank you!\"\nHim: *flips hair and quickly turns away*\n\nHe didn't actually *flip his hair* (it's an idiom) but he gave off the \"whatever, girlfriend\" vibe. Not a deal breaker but the lack of mannerisms and response was off-putting. The other taller male server with the side swept bangs was really nice though. He read my mind when I wanted a glass of water and nicely packed my leftovers into different compartments. \n\nUsually the ambiance and d\u00e9cor at Asian restaurants are an afterthought. This is definitely a restaurant for the millennials, it's hip, trendy, and great for groups. Too bad, there's no full bar.\n\nParking is VERY difficult during the weekdays. Since there's no meters or time limitations on parking (other than street cleaning), people that work and live in the area park all day in the area. I got lucky. As I was driving down the street, someone pulled out of their space. Parking on the weekend should be much easier. \n\nKin Khao and Lers Ros (original TL location) are still my top picks for Thai food but Farmhouse Kitchen is great for a hot date and chic group together.

Authenticity be damn because the \"real\" versions of any popular dish may be a real crapshoot. \n\nFarmhouse gets kudos from me though. Their wait staff seem to be Thai and the menu had some great dishes, both in presentation and taste.  We tried the steak roll appetizer and the meat was amazingly tender. It wrapped with cucumbers, mint and other flavorful things that I couldn't make out but it was delicious.  Pad Thai was okay and I wish it had more noodles. I think this was more presentation than anything else. They also only give you two prawns with it. Really? You're better than that Farmhouse! Lastly, we also tried the beef short rib that was tender off the bone. It had his curry like sauce that I used to mop up some of the blue rice. Highly recommend for meat lovers out there.\n\nSo if your thing is to bring Thailand over to America in the Mission District of San Francisco, you may be more critical than I am.

Unless I drive over there, it's a bit of a schlep especially if you're counting on the 12 to pick you up sometime in your lifetime. However, my friend Maggie took the advice of a colleague of hers and invited Jamie W. and me to dinner at this spot of which I was completely unaware. Trick Dog and Central Kitchen are just around the corner, but I didn't know this happening Thai eatery was attracting the young and hip all on its own.\n\nIt looked expansive when I first entered the empty restaurant, but it crowded quickly before we knew it. I got there first and ordered a $4.50 Classic Thai Tea just because I needed something refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/2fBnKd3).

Maggie decided to get something with more of a kick and landed on a $9.50 Thai Cooler which mixed a lager with fresh pineapple juice, lime, and cane sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfssLK).\n\nWe decided to share our plates and started with the $12 Ahi Scoops, a quartet of appetizer servings combining pan-seared Ahi tuna covered in black sesame seeds, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam, dill, lemongrass, and chili lime (photo: http://bit.ly/2gwcZYe). Tasty bites with a nice contrast in textures, they were like maki rolls without the rice. We moved on to a $12 tureen of the popular Tom Kha, a luxuriant coconut soup with mushroom, tomato, galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, long coriander, and for $4 extra, fresh prawns (photo: http://bit.ly/2gJf06m). It was a lovely tropical broth that tasted creamy without having any cream in it.\n\nOur entrees came next with the recommended $18 Hat Yai Fried Chicken arriving first. It's a Southern Thai specialty that fries up a large chicken breast and adds fried shallots, turmeric, and other herbs in the coating. It came with a bowl of potato yellow curry, roti bread for dipping, and a scoop of intensely blue rice made from dok un sun (butterfly peas) (photo: http://bit.ly/2g2gAiz). The poultry was quite tender on its own, but the curry, rice and roti bread made it a more complete meal. The finale was the $22 Panang Neua, a large slow-braised, bone-in short rib with a Panang curry ladled over it.\n\nIt came with grilled broccolini, peppers, onion, fried basil, and more of that blue rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfzHmW). That was definitely a high point with the meat falling off the bone with ease with the curry providing extra punch. For dessert, an indulgence I know after all that food, we decided to splurge and get the $26 Ruk Na Platter, a somewhat overpriced potpourri of most of their specialty desserts - taro sticky rice, coconut creme brulee, choco cake, a caramel macaron, and a wedge of fresh seedless watermelon (photo: http://bit.ly/2fP7F0L).

First of all, I LOVE Thai food. Secondly, this is a sister restaurant of Kitchen Story. Beside it's location being a wee bit out of the way, I didn't see any reason why I should not pay it a visit. Last night, I finally came here with the BFF for a weekend dinner, AND today again with my mum for lunch. (Mum got a bit jelly and curious when she saw my food posts on a different social media handle. Curse Internet!!)\n\nIt's an interesting location for a restaurant. Then again there are a few other cafes in the neighborhood. Gentrification at its best. Parking seems packed both times I was there yet I got lucky and someone pulled out of their places both times. Super cute and trendy decor filled with hippie ambience. Can be a bit loud with the music though.\n\nThe service was great both times. During my first visit, we were greeted promptly and led to the bar area since we didn't make reservation and the place was pretty crowded already. During my second visit today, we were seated at a table as the place was pretty empty. I supposed that people would opt for a brunch place with bottomless mimosa instead of Thai food on this gorgeous Sunday. \n\nNow on to the food. Portions are decent and presentation is beautifully Instagram-worthy (when you see two big guys sitting at the next table taking picture of their food, you'd know what's up.) During my first visit, the BFF and I tried some of the dishes the lot raved so much about:\n*Hat Yai Chicken: The fried chicken breast was crunchy with decent flavor. The curry was flavorful but a bit on the sweet side. The roti, unfortunately, was hard and difficult to chew. We had to put each piece into the curry sauce to \"rehydrate\" them and it would still be difficult to eat. \n*24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup: The beef was fall-off-the-bone tender and very flavorful. Regrettably, the broth was awfully salty.\n*Ahi Scoops: Warning: super spicy chili sauce sitting right on top of the piece of tuna. I literally sat there for a good minute or two before I regain a little sense of my taste buds. I could barely taste any other flavor from the rest of the dish. Just be sure to have your water ready for it.\nThe second time around, my mum and I decided to try something different:\n*Daily special red curry with (something) prawns in half pineapple: We wanted to try a curry dish and the waitress was recommending it so we thought why not. It wasn't very impressive. Again, the curry was not spicy at all and rather sweet. The two giant prawns were somewhat undercooked and difficult to eat. Love the coconut rice though.\n*Pad Thai with Tofu: Decent and solid classic Thai street dish. Yum.\nWe also tried their *Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. They seemed to have combined black sticky rice with regular sticky rice so the consistency was pretty interesting in a good way. Love the fragrant sesame seeds as well.\n\nTheir drinks are pretty interesting too. Besides just the usual Thai Iced Tea that could be found in regular Thai restaurant, they have variety beers, wine, hot drinks and tea as well. Collectively during both visits, we have tried their *Honey Milk Lavender, *Ginger Milk Tea, *Coconut Cream Latte, and *Rogue Hazelnut Brown beer. They were all wonderful. \n\nPeople might find the price a little higher than other Thai restaurants but I am willing to pay for the wonderful meal, service, and ambience. It's probably good for date night too :P Overall, I enjoy both meals I got there. The one star was taken off because of the overly salty broth and sweet sweet curry.

My friends and I were looking for something new and different for dinner and found this Thai restaurant.  Farmhouse Kitchen is a really fun way to experience Thai food with your family and friends.   A look at their website will tell you what you need to know.\n\nI had arrived early and walked in to check in with the host.  That host was a site to behold, truly a Snapchat picture come to life with floral headband and beautifully done makeup!  We could not be seated until all members of our party arrived so we decided to wait outside on one of available seats.  I saw one thing I really liked, which was that many people were getting food to go.  Either this is the only place in the area to eat (it's not) or the food is really good (it was).  Reservations are needed or a long wait could ensue.\n\nWhen all members of our party were present, we were promptly seated.  We asked our server for recommendations for beverage and food selections.  We started with the Neua Num Tok Rolls, then ordered the Herbal Rice Salad, Hat Yai Fried Chicken and the Panang Neua.  We chose to eat our dishes family style but each entree could definitely be eaten on its own.  \n\nThe Neua Num Tok Rolls, were wagyu beef rolls wrapped with herbs and cucumbers in a tangy vinaigrette.  The beef was tender, succulent and beautifully seasoned.  This was my favorite dish of the night!  The Herbal Rice Salad was a fantastic mix of textures and sweet, salty, sour and spicy flavors.  I could have eaten a heaping bowl of this dish.  \n\nThe fried chicken dish is highly recommended but note that they prepare the chicken with a very light and delicate batter, likely using rice flour or cornstarch in their mix.  It comes with pieces of roti and a yellow curry sauce.  I love fried chicken and found this version well seasoned, tender and juicy.  If I recall, this also comes with a side dish of honey.  I was happy to have shared this dish as it might have been too rich for me on its own.\n\nPanang Neua is a short rib on bone that was cooked until fall apart tender.  It came with a nice curry sauce that cut into the richness of the meat and came with their blue rice and broccolini.  This dish is definitely good for meat lovers!\n\nTo accompany this meal I ordered the Thai Chelada.  Most of their cocktails are on the sweet side so I selected this beverage on advice of our waitress.  It's similar to a Michelada.  While the beverage itself was fine the spice mix was a bit on the salty side.  Luckily, they have a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic options.  \n\nThe staff were helpful and really friendly.  They have a great way of celebrating birthdays here.  Farmhouse Kitchen could easily have been one of those places that known for cocktails, flash and overpriced menus.  However, it's not and the food is really one of the reasons to try this restaurant.  The food is presented in a beautiful manner and tastes great too!\n\nParking is not easy but it was doable.  I found a spot one block away on a Friday evening and a couple of spots opened up right in front of the restaurant while I was waiting for my friends.

However, my friend Maggie took the advice of a colleague of hers and invited Jamie W. and me to dinner at this spot of which I was completely unaware. Trick Dog and Central Kitchen are just around the corner, but I didn't know this happening Thai eatery was attracting the young and hip all on its own.\n\nIt looked expansive when I first entered the empty restaurant, but it crowded quickly before we knew it. I got there first and ordered a $4.50 Classic Thai Tea just because I needed something refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/2fBnKd3).

It even had a pink straw and matching umbrella (photo:  http://bit.ly/2fP2jCW). Maggie decided to get something with more of a kick and landed on a $9.50 Thai Cooler which mixed a lager with fresh pineapple juice, lime, and cane sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfssLK).\n\nWe decided to share our plates and started with the $12 Ahi Scoops, a quartet of appetizer servings combining pan-seared Ahi tuna covered in black sesame seeds, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam, dill, lemongrass, and chili lime (photo: http://bit.ly/2gwcZYe). Tasty bites with a nice contrast in textures, they were like maki rolls without the rice. We moved on to a $12 tureen of the popular Tom Kha, a luxuriant coconut soup with mushroom, tomato, galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, long coriander, and for $4 extra, fresh prawns (photo: http://bit.ly/2gJf06m). It was a lovely tropical broth that tasted creamy without having any cream in it.\n\nOur entrees came next with the recommended $18 Hat Yai Fried Chicken arriving first. It's a Southern Thai specialty that fries up a large chicken breast and adds fried shallots, turmeric, and other herbs in the coating. It came with a bowl of potato yellow curry, roti bread for dipping, and a scoop of intensely blue rice made from dok un sun (butterfly peas) (photo: http://bit.ly/2g2gAiz). The poultry was quite tender on its own, but the curry, rice and roti bread made it a more complete meal. The finale was the $22 Panang Neua, a large slow-braised, bone-in short rib with a Panang curry ladled over it.\n\nIt came with grilled broccolini, peppers, onion, fried basil, and more of that blue rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfzHmW). That was definitely a high point with the meat falling off the bone with ease with the curry providing extra punch. For dessert, an indulgence I know after all that food, we decided to splurge and get the $26 Ruk Na Platter, a somewhat overpriced potpourri of most of their specialty desserts - taro sticky rice, coconut creme brulee, choco cake, a caramel macaron, and a wedge of fresh seedless watermelon (photo: http://bit.ly/2fP7F0L).

The food is delicious. Every single dish is genuinely inventive. The portions are massive. The price is just right. If you've got friends from out of town and want to show them the Culinary Delights of the City without showing them the Insane Price of the City, Farmhouse is unequivocally the place. If you're alone and want to chow down at a bar, Farmhouse has you covered. And if you want to grab the best takeout of your life at 9:30pm on a Tuesday, Farmhouse is there for you too. Within 20 minutes you'll be on the couch, in your underwear, stuffing your face with kobe rolls and a soup with a comically large bone-in rib, and you'll feel like a goddamn king.\n\nI cannot praise this place enough: there does not exist a bad item on the menu. And trust me, as a local who eats here 2-4 times a week, I've exhaustively searched. This is not the sort of joint where you want to order a pound of Pad Kee Mow or Red Duck Curry: aim for the specials and treat yourself to brand new flavors. Personal highlights:\n- Panang Neua. Bone-in rib cooked in delicious panang curry, with blue rice and broccolini. I suspect this is their most popular dish, and with good reason: it's phenomenal\n- Crab Fried Rice. Everything about this dish is amazing, but the sauce is what really makes it stand out.\n- 24 Hour Beef Soup. Zesty, decadent, perfect levels of spice, complete with that signature rib.

I'd give points for the juiciness of the chicken and the perfect texture of the fried shell around it (probably the exact same batter and technique used with the calamari), and also for the addition of roti, potato yellow curry and blue rice to round everything out.  however, if you come to FT for something that has a knock-your-socks-off flavor profile just know in advance that this is not the one.  but if you'd like one mild dish, perhaps for a less adventurous friend/family member, this one is a winner.\n\nneua yang steak - 27.95\n^one of my friends saw \"wagyu flank steak\" and added this to our order.  the surprising thing?  while the flank steak was good, I just couldn't get enough of the bed of Thai long beans underneath.

I'd put that on a car tire and eat it. \n\ncrab fried rice - 25.95\n^ordered this two out of the three times I've been and have never tried the bone broth that comes on the side, haha.  am I missing out?  in any event, they do not skimp on the crab meat - hallelujah!\n\nhat yai fried chicken - 21.50\n^the friend who originally put FT on my radar just loooves this dish.  I'd give points for the juiciness of the chicken and the perfect texture of the fried shell around it (probably the exact same batter and technique used with the calamari), and also for the addition of roti, potato yellow curry and blue rice to round everything out.  however, if you come to FT for something that has a knock-your-socks-off flavor profile just know in advance that this is not the one.  but if you'd like one mild dish, perhaps for a less adventurous friend/family member, this one is a winner.\n\nneua yang steak - 27.95\n^one of my friends saw \"wagyu flank steak\" and added this to our order.  the surprising thing?  while the flank steak was good, I just couldn't get enough of the bed of Thai long beans underneath.  Paired with the ginger rice, too?  Holy heck... I thought it was good enough to skip the meat and just go vegan.  small note: get ready to take a video once they light this on fire - so Instagram worthy, haha.\n\npad see you beef and chicken - 16.5\n^i prefer getting this with beef rather than chicken, but either way they're both good.  this dish also made me think about being a little more \"strategic\" when ordering from Farmhouse.  you could probably enjoy pad see you at a number of different Thai restaurants throughout the city at about half the price.  unless pad see you is an absolutely must, i think you could forgo it in order to get something that you'll only really see at Farmhouse.  just a thought!\n\npanang neua - 27.95\n^i'll be honest and say that i had some reservations about this dish because some photos make the rib look pretty small.  honestly, though, the panang curry that this is cooked in, and whatever dry rub they might use in addition to it, makes a little short rib meat go a looong way.  this is not a dish you need a lot of in terms of quantity; just a small piece with rice and broccolini = perfection.\n\nkick boxing bowl - 24\n^delicious cocktail WITH A DISCO LIGHT?!  sold.\n\nthai vacation - 10 \n^the menu says it's a \"half fresh coconut filled with black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream topped with peanut and sesame\".  i'm a fan of fresh coconut, black sticky rice and vanilla ice cream and thought this was a good, but not great, choice.  next time i'll go for gold and get the ruk na platter.\n\nAssorted Notes:\n\nIt is super easy to make a reservation through Yelp so DO IT; this place can get packed during dinner and there isn't a huge waiting area so you'll have to wait outside in the (California) cold during our winter months.\n\nI've never had to park more than a block away from Farmhouse (I'm guessing most SF locals choose to Lyft, Uber, Muni in?), but this part of the Mission doesn't necessarily feel unsafe when you're walking around at night.  \n\nPost Farmhouse option (I have tried this after dinner on a weeknight) - Boba Guys further down on 19th (between Lexington and Valencia) and then people watching at Mission Playground or a couple blocks further at Dolores Park.  It's 10 city blocks from the restaurant to bubble tea, and a little over half a mile, but it's a good way to fend off a food coma, clear room in your tummy and then enjoy BG's \"grade A balls.\"", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-12-13"}, {"excerpts": ["- Side of bone broth: I don't know why I expected more from this lol "], "author": "Roxanne A.", "review": "***MORE LIKE A 3.5*** \n\nMy sister and brother in law put it on hella thick that this spot was going to be good and it was the \"best\" Thai spot they've been to out in the Bay so I had to try it! They also said everything they had was HELLA good. With that said, I ordered a variety of things off the menu and I can't say I had the same experience. \n\nFirst impression, I liked their little hidden location. I thought the place itself was hella cute and decorated fun. I wanted to take that flower pot/center piece home lol but I took a picture of it instead. The service was like other people have said it was so-so. I didn't think they were hella friendly and they weren't hella rude BUT I did feel rushed towards the end when hella people started lining up outside the doors. Luckily, because it was planned I set up reservations around 6 PM this past Sunday so it wasn't hella busy when we first came in. Also, I don't know if I was just distracted but I was surprised at how fast everything came out. \n\nAs for the food, I listed what we ordered and my personal opinion: \n\nSTARTERS \n- Ahi scoops: hella cute to look at & tasted just as good too, the fish was fresh, the flavor had a little kick to it, know that they only come with 4 servings though \n- Thai fish cakes: this wasn't anything extraordinary but it wasn't bad, I think this came with 6 cakes and crispies underneath \n- Kobe beef jerky: I know it's supposed to be jerky but I thought it was a little too dry LOL, either that or it really didn't have any flavor it was more something to chew on but it is good with the lime-y sauce \n- Mieng Kum Kung: unfortunately didn't get to try this because it's my sisters favorite thing from this spot lol and everyone ate it all, there wasn't enough to serve our table so order appropriately lol \n\nSPECIAL \n- Mok salmon: I like how they wrapped it with the fresh dill on top added a LITTLE flavor, and they didn't overcook the salmon, it is better with the green sauce which I am assuming is something cilantro-lime-y \n- Panang neua: the best thing here according to my sister and brother in law, I agree there is a lot of flavor, sweeter than I am used to but still hella good! The meat falls right off the bone \n- Hat Yai fried chicken: the \"other\" best thing, again I lucked out trying this one but I did try the dipping sauce and again, lots of flavor and if you like your curry sweet it's good. \n\nTHAI STREET FOOD \n- Pad See You: My family ordered this last minute so I was too stuffed to try it. My brother said it was the best he had because he could tell the noodles were fresh and prepared there \n\nSOUP\n- Tom yum: one of the main reasons I had to knock them down some, this arrived fast but HELLA cold like nobody wants cold soup (well at my table anyway) and on top of that the spoon they gave me was hella too big to scoop stuff out, there wasn't enough broth to serve to everyone at my table, the flavor was good extra tangy and spicy which I liked but don't expect more than 6 prawns, I prefer more of a seafood combination option \n\nSALAD \n- Yum Moo Krob: I thought \"garden vegetables\" was going to be more like a typical salad but it was just pork belly on top of hard cabbage with a sauce similar to what they put on the larb. I was disappointed this didn't taste as good as I hoped. To be honest, there was no crunch to the pork belly it was either prepared with too much moisture or it was sitting out for a while. It hurt my teeth to eat this lol. You know it's not crispy enough when the skin is like sticking to your teeth. My brother in law can cook a mean piece of lechon though, which I think most prefer crispy. \n\nSIDES \n- Side of asparagus: I liked this, not overcooked, still crispy, and who doesn't like garlic? \n- Side of bone broth: I don't know why I expected more from this lol but it was simple, not bad, kind of what you would get if you ordered broth at a pho restaurant \n\nDESSERT \nPlatter: Enough to feed our table lol, variety of things to choose from & again cute \n\nOverall, I didn't hate it but I think my sister made me set high expectations. I think it would have been different if we didn't feel rushed and the soup was actually hot. I would come back and try the things I missed!

Chicken was tender, but bland. \n\nChicken wings were pretty good. The skin had a nice crunch to it. The sauce that you dip it in is a mixture of that sweet thai sauce from a bottle and they chopped in fresh chile and garlic.

Mary's Organic Chicken breast, turmeric & herbs,\nFried shallots, roti bread, potato yellow curry for dipping. Blue rice-my friends and Yelpers said this place was a must. So good.

Put our names down for 2 and were told that they would call in 30-45mins when our table was ready.  So we took off and came back 45-mins later expecting to be seated soon.  The host told us (could have been a language communication issue) that he still had no table for us and moreover, his 9pm reservations were going to arrive soon and we as walk-ins would be bumped yet again for them.\n\nWhat kind of hospitality is this?\n \nConsidering we just came back from a different establishment and dropped $30 on cocktails waiting for our table.  [Note to owner: don't let those $30 go to another place next time because we didn't order ANY drinks with dinner.  Not the wisest business decision on your most profitable product- alcohol]\n\nBefore we could fume however, we saw a few people get up from the bar seating and pointed the empty seats to the host and asked to be seated at the bar instead of waiting another hour.  The host obliged.\n\nNow with that experience behind us, we moved on.\n\nFOOD: authentic, delicious, and came out QUICK.  We ordered (for 2):\n\n-Crab fried rice: a MUST.  The rice was soft and perfectly cooked, and CHUNKS of crab were visible.  Came with a bowl of delicious chicken bone broth.  Very satisfying.\n\n-Papaya salad: refreshing and savory.  We ordered \"spicy\" and were warned that it was going to be SPICY.  It wasn't.  Just the right amount of spicy and I can handle some, so it was perfectly fine.\n\n-Beef rolls: they were AMAZING!!  Grilled Steak wrapped around cucumber and served up with a sweet and savory sauce.  The roll was a bit too large to stuff in our mouths in one bite so I would recommend cutting it up.  Hopefully the chef can just make more smaller rolls to enjoy so you don't have a mouthful of food and chewing it for a solid 5 minutes to get any kind of room in your mouth to even speak or breathe.\n\n-Tom Yum: if I could re-order, I would NOT have ordered this.  It was just fine, and we were warned yet again that this was super duper spicy.  It was a tad spicy but again not that bad.  Let's just say I wasn't dunking my mouth in my water cup at any point of the meal.\n\nWe left incredibly full and satisfied.  No room for dessert.  Everyone was much nicer on our way out and we'll probably be back.  Hopefully they work out a better system to seat customers in a more efficient manner and improve on the hospitality.

Trick Dog and Central Kitchen are just around the corner, but I didn't know this happening Thai eatery was attracting the young and hip all on its own.\n\nIt looked expansive when I first entered the empty restaurant, but it crowded quickly before we knew it. I got there first and ordered a $4.50 Classic Thai Tea just because I needed something refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/2fBnKd3). Once we sat at the table, I moved onto the even more refreshing $6.50 Whole Young Coconut, which is exactly what it was like I was on an episode of Gilligan's Island with the Howells. It even had a pink straw and matching umbrella (photo:  http://bit.ly/2fP2jCW). Maggie decided to get something with more of a kick and landed on a $9.50 Thai Cooler which mixed a lager with fresh pineapple juice, lime, and cane sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfssLK).\n\nWe decided to share our plates and started with the $12 Ahi Scoops, a quartet of appetizer servings combining pan-seared Ahi tuna covered in black sesame seeds, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam, dill, lemongrass, and chili lime (photo: http://bit.ly/2gwcZYe). Tasty bites with a nice contrast in textures, they were like maki rolls without the rice. We moved on to a $12 tureen of the popular Tom Kha, a luxuriant coconut soup with mushroom, tomato, galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, long coriander, and for $4 extra, fresh prawns (photo: http://bit.ly/2gJf06m). It was a lovely tropical broth that tasted creamy without having any cream in it.\n\nOur entrees came next with the recommended $18 Hat Yai Fried Chicken arriving first. It's a Southern Thai specialty that fries up a large chicken breast and adds fried shallots, turmeric, and other herbs in the coating. It came with a bowl of potato yellow curry, roti bread for dipping, and a scoop of intensely blue rice made from dok un sun (butterfly peas) (photo: http://bit.ly/2g2gAiz). The poultry was quite tender on its own, but the curry, rice and roti bread made it a more complete meal.
