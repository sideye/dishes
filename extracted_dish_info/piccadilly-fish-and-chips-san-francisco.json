The chips or fries (because that's what they are) could be improved because no matter how long they sit in the fryer the outsides never seem to be crispy enough.

I mean, the Piccadilly I knew had an elderly Korean couple working there, the sweetest people who enjoyed what they did at the shop.  We'd walk in, and we would always be greeted by the couple with warm smiles on their faces.  My favorite item on the menu?  Oyster and chips...with lots of malt vinegar...and a root beer on the side.  But then I realized that the outside of the shop did look a bit updated, the menu had slight changes (which showed that they no longer serve/cook deep fried squid), the root beer bottles in the fridge were replaced by canned soda, and the old cash register that never worked (but made a cute prop) was gone.  While I was waiting for my order, a sweet older woman came by and asked the man, \"Do you remember me?  I always sit over there (pointing towards the window seating area). And I always order the squid and the chips.\"  Now you see, the original owners would most of the time remember their customers. The old man was confused, and barely spoke english.

There is an overhead menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=7HDhwAft71dZpuahpp0VPA) that you order from, and I've noticed most people do take out.  I've always had my food there on one of the sturdy wooden chairs and wobbly wooden tables.  The restaurant has updated copies of the daily Examiner or the latest SF Weekly to keep patrons informed while they wait for their food.\n\nFor tonight's visit I had a 3 piece fish with chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=lA-mFqLiaNIfdI-MA2Dm3Q).  When dining at the restaurant you have the option of adding your own salt and malt vinegar whereas for take out they'll actually add it for you before wrapping your order with a clean sheet of white paper with newspaper on the outside.  Tartar sauce is available upon request as it is usually stored inside the refrigerator.\n\nI decided to have my meal without the added salt, vinegar or tartar sauce for a change.  The fish is very good.  The choice filets of white fish are thick and firm and the crispy batter has just a tad of seasoning in it to keep it from tasting bland.  The chips or fries (because that's what they are) could be improved because no matter how long they sit in the fryer the outsides never seem to be crispy enough.  These are fat fries with lots of meat in the middle, but often I tend to taste the oil instead of the actual potato.\n\nIf you're not certain what you'd like to try Piccadilly offers a combination platter also.

All of the seafood and the fresh rings of white onion are dipped in the same batter and put into the fryer.  While I enjoyed the flattened, butterflied shrimps and the mini oysters the hot, creamy onions just didn't seem to taste right when matched with the batter.\n\nI love the fried mushrooms too.

Its a shack masquerading as a restaurant thats barely staying afloat.

First, I tried to greet the folks behind the counter with a 'Hello' and handshake.  The woman/wife glared at me with horror as though I were ripe with disease.  I politely backed off as it was clear she didn't want to hear about my childhood visits.  She and her husband immediately snarled, \"No English! No English!\"  Fine.  We then eyeballed the fading menu.  We got the 2-piece fish and chips and an order of onion rings.  Now a vegetarian, I asked if they fried their meats separately from their veggies.  The man barked \"Fries here! Fish here! Onions here!\", firmly pointing to each deep-fryer.  Thanks for clarifying, Mr. Manners. I paid nearly $14 for it all.  As we waited for our food, we noted the restaurant's disgusting condition. \n\nThe floor and tables were greasy and dirty.  The closet of a restroom was dirty, tagged with graffiti, and dilapidated.  I had to feel my way to the light switch!  The smell of rotting grease filled the air.  Do they empty and clean their fryers?  Upon serving our food, their body language was stiff as they looked reluctant to serve us, the only patrons present.  Each piece of fish was next to the veggies.  To be safe, I asked the man to identify and confirm.  He barked \"This fish! This onion rings! This fries!\"  Even so, I clearly could tell otherwise.  My omnivorous friend was able to confirm my suspicions and told me the opposite.  When we both took a bite, the food was flavorless.  \n\nMy intuitions screamed louder every minute we remained.  Ultimately, I insisted we spare our stomachs, kidneys, and the night!  Although I wasted $14, I valued our friendship and wellbeing more.

I've always had my food there on one of the sturdy wooden chairs and wobbly wooden tables.  The restaurant has updated copies of the daily Examiner or the latest SF Weekly to keep patrons informed while they wait for their food.\n\nFor tonight's visit I had a 3 piece fish with chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=lA-mFqLiaNIfdI-MA2Dm3Q).  When dining at the restaurant you have the option of adding your own salt and malt vinegar whereas for take out they'll actually add it for you before wrapping your order with a clean sheet of white paper with newspaper on the outside.  Tartar sauce is available upon request as it is usually stored inside the refrigerator.\n\nI decided to have my meal without the added salt, vinegar or tartar sauce for a change.  The fish is very good.  The choice filets of white fish are thick and firm and the crispy batter has just a tad of seasoning in it to keep it from tasting bland.  The chips or fries (because that's what they are) could be improved because no matter how long they sit in the fryer the outsides never seem to be crispy enough.  These are fat fries with lots of meat in the middle, but often I tend to taste the oil instead of the actual potato.\n\nIf you're not certain what you'd like to try Piccadilly offers a combination platter also.

All of the seafood and the fresh rings of white onion are dipped in the same batter and put into the fryer.  While I enjoyed the flattened, butterflied shrimps and the mini oysters the hot, creamy onions just didn't seem to taste right when matched with the batter.\n\nI love the fried mushrooms too.

The atmosphere is a wee bit on the \"loiny\" side, but the tables are clean, the fish is fresh, and you couldn't ask for nicer service. I wouldn't say it's the best of the best, but darn good for a little neighborhood hole in the wall.

Its a shack masquerading as a restaurant thats barely staying afloat.  If you don't want to serve quality food within cleanly facilities with a smile and can barely speak English, then why are you independently operating a restaurant in the U.S.?  Wouldn't be surprised to see their makeshift \"Cash Only\" sign replaced with a 'For Lease' sign come December.\n\nOne night, I brought my friend.  First, I tried to greet the folks behind the counter with a 'Hello' and handshake.  The woman/wife glared at me with horror as though I were ripe with disease.  I politely backed off as it was clear she didn't want to hear about my childhood visits.  She and her husband immediately snarled, \"No English! No English!\"  Fine.  We then eyeballed the fading menu.  We got the 2-piece fish and chips and an order of onion rings.  Now a vegetarian, I asked if they fried their meats separately from their veggies.  The man barked \"Fries here! Fish here! Onions here!\", firmly pointing to each deep-fryer.  Thanks for clarifying, Mr. Manners. I paid nearly $14 for it all.  As we waited for our food, we noted the restaurant's disgusting condition. \n\nThe floor and tables were greasy and dirty.  The closet of a restroom was dirty, tagged with graffiti, and dilapidated.  I had to feel my way to the light switch!  The smell of rotting grease filled the air.  Do they empty and clean their fryers?  Upon serving our food, their body language was stiff as they looked reluctant to serve us, the only patrons present.  Each piece of fish was next to the veggies.  To be safe, I asked the man to identify and confirm.  He barked \"This fish! This onion rings! This fries!\"  Even so, I clearly could tell otherwise.  My omnivorous friend was able to confirm my suspicions and told me the opposite.  When we both took a bite, the food was flavorless.  \n\nMy intuitions screamed louder every minute we remained.  Ultimately, I insisted we spare our stomachs, kidneys, and the night!  Although I wasted $14, I valued our friendship and wellbeing more.

There is an overhead menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=7HDhwAft71dZpuahpp0VPA) that you order from, and I've noticed most people do take out.  I've always had my food there on one of the sturdy wooden chairs and wobbly wooden tables.  The restaurant has updated copies of the daily Examiner or the latest SF Weekly to keep patrons informed while they wait for their food.\n\nFor tonight's visit I had a 3 piece fish with chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=lA-mFqLiaNIfdI-MA2Dm3Q).  When dining at the restaurant you have the option of adding your own salt and malt vinegar whereas for take out they'll actually add it for you before wrapping your order with a clean sheet of white paper with newspaper on the outside.  Tartar sauce is available upon request as it is usually stored inside the refrigerator.\n\nI decided to have my meal without the added salt, vinegar or tartar sauce for a change.  The fish is very good.  The choice filets of white fish are thick and firm and the crispy batter has just a tad of seasoning in it to keep it from tasting bland.  The chips or fries (because that's what they are) could be improved because no matter how long they sit in the fryer the outsides never seem to be crispy enough.  These are fat fries with lots of meat in the middle, but often I tend to taste the oil instead of the actual potato.\n\nIf you're not certain what you'd like to try Piccadilly offers a combination platter also.

He always seems to be happy and genuinely welcomes all of the patrons as soon as they open the door.\n\nIt's a pretty basic set up.  There is an overhead menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=7HDhwAft71dZpuahpp0VPA) that you order from, and I've noticed most people do take out.  I've always had my food there on one of the sturdy wooden chairs and wobbly wooden tables.  The restaurant has updated copies of the daily Examiner or the latest SF Weekly to keep patrons informed while they wait for their food.\n\nFor tonight's visit I had a 3 piece fish with chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=lA-mFqLiaNIfdI-MA2Dm3Q).  When dining at the restaurant you have the option of adding your own salt and malt vinegar whereas for take out they'll actually add it for you before wrapping your order with a clean sheet of white paper with newspaper on the outside.  Tartar sauce is available upon request as it is usually stored inside the refrigerator.\n\nI decided to have my meal without the added salt, vinegar or tartar sauce for a change.  The fish is very good.  The choice filets of white fish are thick and firm and the crispy batter has just a tad of seasoning in it to keep it from tasting bland.  The chips or fries (because that's what they are) could be improved because no matter how long they sit in the fryer the outsides never seem to be crispy enough.  These are fat fries with lots of meat in the middle, but often I tend to taste the oil instead of the actual potato.\n\nIf you're not certain what you'd like to try Piccadilly offers a combination platter also.  The combination includes one piece of fish, two pieces of shrimp, three oysters and four onion rings all served over a layer of fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=3p7MjyVby4e8IwjXltHA1g).  All of the seafood and the fresh rings of white onion are dipped in the same batter and put into the fryer.  While I enjoyed the flattened, butterflied shrimps and the mini oysters the hot, creamy onions just didn't seem to taste right when matched with the batter.\n\nI love the fried mushrooms too.  Friendly service.  Open until 11 PM on most nights.  Pay before you eat or after.  Cash only.

This place stands out from other places I have ordered fish and chips from. Is it because they use peanut oil?\n\nIf you're thinking \"this guy is nuts!! Camelot (Pacifica, CA) is THE place for Fish and Chips!!\" then you might be (sorta) right...Camelot is (or was) a good spot. I used to frequent Camelot often, but the last time I went there (about half a year ago) I was disappointed. Something about the fish was off...taste was not there maybe? (What I do like about Camelot is that they have Cock 'N Bull ginger soda) \n\nWhen going here, don't expect a nice place serving beer battered Fish and Chips. This is a classic hole-in-the-wall/greasy spoon type of place. Don't expect healthy anything here...it's a FISH and Chips joint people!....everything here on the menu is mostly fried.
