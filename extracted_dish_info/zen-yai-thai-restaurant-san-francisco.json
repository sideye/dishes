A rich and hearty soup, get it with wide rice noodles.  The other two soups were also delicious.  One was a thai sweet and sour soup with fish balls and other seafood ingredients topped with deep-fried wonton skins.  (3.50)  The last was a tom-yum type sound with ground pork and bbq pork.

Come here for the small bowls of noodles off the menu! They're the best in flavor and in value. Where else can you find $2.50 bowls of noodles?!\n\nMy friend recommended this spot for the cheap $2.50 boat noodles. It's not in the best of locations (hello Tenderloin!), but I imagine it's the shady surroundings that keep the menu prices down, so I'm not complaining. We stopped by shortly after 11AM on a Saturday. Relatively quiet and got a little busier around lunchtime but not crowded.\n\nThe menu they hand you has the typical things you'd find at Thai restaurants: noodles, rice plates, curries, stir fries, etc. Everything's pretty cheap around $7-8, $10 max. But what you really want is on the Thai menu on the wall; that's the real highlight here, the BOAT NOODLES. In Thailand, boat noodles are served in small bowls and people order many bowls, leaving tall stacks of empty bowls when they're done. Here, you can get a small size for $2.50, either with beef or pork, or you can get a large for $6.95. There's also small bowls of TOM YUM and YEN TA FO for $3.50, or $7.95 for large bowls.\n\nMy friends and I ordered 1 each of the small bowls - beef boat noodles, pork boat noodles, tom yum and yen ta fo. For small bowls, they were actually a pretty decent size. If you're like me and like trying several small dishes vs getting one large dish, these small bowls are perfect. 2 would probably be good if you have a smaller appetite; 3 if you have a larger appetite. Basically lunch for as little as $5! Not quite the prices you'd find in Thailand, but close enough.\n\nWe also got fish cakes as an appetizer and red duck curry to share, but personally, I would just stick with the small bowls of noodles. They were much more worth it from a cost, portion size and taste perspective.\n\n* BOAT NOODLES ($2.50 small, $6.95 large) - 5/5\nThese were my favorite of the small noodle bowls. Dark, muddyish broth with thin noodles, beef or pork, meatballs, veggies and chicharrones. Both the beef and pork were tender, and the broth was deliciously bold and flavorful.\n\n* YEN TA FO ($3.50 small, $7.95 large) - 4.5/5\nPink seafood noodle soup that included fish ball, squid, coagulated pork blood, veggies and fried wonton chips. Good flavor and a little spicier than the other noodles.\n\n* TOM YUM ($3.50 small, $7.95 large) - 4/5\nSlightly sweet, slightly sour broth with noodles, meat, veggies and fried wonton chips. I liked this as a lighter flavor profile in comparison to the other noodles, but it didn't impress me as much. I think there was pork liver in this one, so be careful of that if you don't like liver!\n\n* TOD MUN / FISH CAKE ($6.95) - 5/5\nEver since I had fish cakes in Thailand, I've always wanted to get them at Thai restaurants back home but they've never been quite as good. The ones here were amazing! \n\n* RED DUCK CURRY ($8.75 rice plate) - 3.5/5\nNot bad. Flavorful curry with duck, pineapple, bamboo shoots and bell pepper, but as far as curries go, it was pretty standard. The duck was more fat than meat, so I found this to be more just rice with red curry.

My dad used to work at City Hall and would take me here when it used to be called Racha Cafe-- long before the Yelp era so that's how you know it's real lol. We even ate here on Racha's last day but thankfully they kept the same menu items that I love. Three signature Racha items that keep me coming back-- Spicy Calamari, Spicy Chicken, and Tod Mun (Thai fish cake). I can't seem to find equivalent dishes at other Thai restaurants! It's pretty cool because my dad would always order these three, and ever since the restaurant became Zen Yai, these are the only menu items that say \"Racha Cafe's style\" in the description. The flavor is the PERFECT combination of basil, jalapenos, and chili pepper. When ordering the spicy calamari, I do suggest asking for less bamboo so you don't get skimped of actual calamari. Other than that, these are must orders.\n\nMoving on, I also love the tom yum soup here because they're very generous with whatever meat or seafood you decide as well as the mushrooms. SO MUCH MUSHROOMS, I love it. The pad thai and pad se ew are also really good. Curry wise, my cousin went to Thailand and got me hooked on curries with a fruit component. Now I always get the red duck curry because the pineapples are such a delightful contrast to the richness of the curry. My mom doesn't like duck so yellow curry with potatoes is also a solid choice. Pair all these with some thai iced tea or even just their hot tea with pandan and you're in a great place.\n\nMore recently, my bf started ordering the Zen Yai Fresh rolls, papaya salad, and crab meat noodles. You just can't go wrong with this place! The fresh rolls are different because the wrapper they use is more like a large rice noodle than the usual spring roll wrappers. Papaya salad is a little on the spicy side, but it's a great healthy addition to a protein and carb heavy meal. I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of crab in the crab meat noodles.\n\nMy favorite part about this place now that I'm older and frequently eat late-- They close at 1AM on Fridays and Saturdays and 9:30pm the rest of the days of the week.

Everything else needed a little help and luckily we had peanut sauce, sweet chili sauce, shiracha, and knives and forks here since we needed them all. I'm not sure I'll eat the leftovers, but I'm sure the husband will. But that's not saying much. \n\nSo tonight I give you props, Zen Yai, for your yellow curry, your very speedy delivery, being open later night, your kind delivery guy who wished us happy New Year and was really sweet, and your abundant amount of food that left us filled up. I'd say, maybe work on the chicken in the combo and kick up the peanut flavor just a bit...but then again, maybe that's my uncultured, American Thai loving palate talking. If so, just keep doing what you're doing. \n\nNow back to my wine.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-01-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Been here twice for lunch and order the Combo #2 each time.

The curry had wilted something in it. The spicy chicken was gristle and chunks of jalapeno that all turned into a jellied brick in the fridge. The fresh rolls were not bad, but they weren't really good either. That and they weren't rolls. They were rolled up then each had several slices thru it causing them to all be an open pile of filling. The brown rice, well, ya can't fuck up brown rice.
