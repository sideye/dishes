And yes, I appreciate the 10% discount off our bill. But when the waiter said he was bringing us out a comped dessert of rice pudding -- which neither of us can eat because we cannot eat dairy -- we protested and asked him not to do so. Nonetheless, the rice pudding was placed on our table and sat untouched. So that was a terrible waste of food, which really unnerved me. It would have been better customer service to at least comp us our Kingfisher beer, which we did drink.\n\nSo I'm sad to say, no thanks.", "rating": 1, "date": "2016-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Highlights are the butter chicken and chili naan.
