The kofte (beef and lamb) was rich and juicy with a subtle gaminess. The beef and lamb were tender and filled with garlicky spices. The shrimp was nicely tender. The chicken, being white pieces was surprisingly very tender and moist. The accompanying yogurt sauce help cut through some of the richness while adding a tangy creaminess.

That lead to another problem which was not being attentive to your other paying guests i.e. US. \n \nWe were done eating for a while and nobody was on the dining floor to assist us.

The kofte (beef and lamb) was rich and juicy with a subtle gaminess. The beef and lamb were tender and filled with garlicky spices. The shrimp was nicely tender. The chicken, being white pieces was surprisingly very tender and moist. The accompanying yogurt sauce help cut through some of the richness while adding a tangy creaminess. I absolutely loved the rice pilaf as it had great texture and flavor. \n\nPortion sizes were very generous and the Layaly Mixed Grill could easily feed 3 people. \n\nS E R V I C E\nOur waitress was very approachable and friendly but spread thin because she was the only one in the front of the house. In the beginning, she was attentive but as it got busy, it was hard for her to keep up. They really need to hire additional help especially during peak hours on the weekends. Nonetheless, she did a great job making sure we were ok and that our water glasses were filled.\n\nMy only gripe is our entrees took a while to arrive. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nCasual, yet very warm and cozy. The mellow yellow walls and the red wooden furnishings created a very welcoming and charming feel to Layaly. There's also a back patio for hookah. \n\nP A R K I N G\nAs previously stated, street parking in the area is a NIGHTMARE. Your best bet is looking for parking a block away on California. There is a parking lot a block away for $6/hour.\n\nWith the Scoutmob deal, we each paid $21 (including tax and gratuity) which was very affordable. They even have $7 lunch specials offered every day. \n\nOther Note(s):\nWe noticed A LOT of people coming into Layaly wanting to do hookah but they didn't offer it on the Sunday we were there, so I highly recommend calling ahead of time to make sure it's being offered that night. \n\nDid you know that Mediterranean food is THE healthiest ethnic cuisine according to CNN?

I guess this place has a hooka lounge in the back because people were walking out of nowhere from the back of the restaurant.

Even if I knew, it has only been in the past year have I grown to enjoy Mediterranean food. It's been my go-to when I want to eat generally healthy. \n\nIt's the night before Bay to Breakers and the hubby and I didn't want to eat anything to heavy before our race so I Yelp'd around the area and came upon Layal. I recall walking by it a few times, and one time even looking at the menu but always disregarded it. This time, I checked out the photos and it was an easy decision. [Note: This is a good sign because my husband knows I can be indecisive, and then i get hangry.] I called in to ask about the wait time for 2 and the girl who picked up the phone said there wasn't any wait but she'll put her name down since it looked like people were slowly trickling in. We weren't too far away so it worked out. \n\nWhen we arrived, there were a few parties sitting down, with much of the tables open. They sat us down and served us water immediately. On it! We took some time to glance over the menu and started off with the hummus, since everyone on here raved about it :) It was a good thing we ordered an appetizer because the kitchen was kind of slow and they were short a server. Jessica was able to get it done though, so helpful! For our entrees, we ended up ordering the Kofte Kebab (mixture of ground lamb and beef with onions and herbs, served with rice and salad) and the Bazinjan Tajine (sirloin saut\u00e9ed in a spicy garlic tomato sauce, with eggplant, onions, and bell peppers, served with a side of rice).\n\nThe hummus was excellent! So smooth and creamy with the perfect amount of flavoring. The drizzle of the olive oil on top was the perfect addition. The pita bread was so fresh and soft!! You really can't yourself from eating it. Since we had to wait a bit for our order to come out, I asked for extra bread to pass the time, and again, it came out piping hot!\n\nMy kofte kebab was delicious! When you cut the meat into bite size pieces, it may appear tough or dry, when you eat it, it's tender and juicy. They know how to do it right! I didn't want the rice and asked for extra salad, and they delivered. Half my plate was covered with fresh arugula with a sprinkle of salt. The tzatziki sauce that came with it was BOMB! Yelpers mentioned that as well. The meat was good and flavorful so I didn't really feel the need to dip too much in it. But I typically don't drench things in sauce or dressing, less is more. Hubbs enjoyed his bazinjan, it is a bit on the spicy side but the amount of spice was good enough where you can still savor and enjoy the flavors of the dish. However, to avoid any upset stomachs, we felt that he best not finish it, since he had to run in 12 hours. Lucky for him, he got to help me with my kofte. \n\nAt the end of the meal, Jessica brought us a baklava for dessert since we had to wait for our meal. What a nice gal! It was good, but it might have given me an allergic reaction. I don't have any known allergies but when I got home, I got a little itchy and was getting red dots on my body. Don't know if it was the baklava cause it has pistachios (something I'm used to eating) or the meal itself. Whatever it is, I'm willing to go back and test it out. It's that good!\n\nSo glad I discovered this quiet, cozy, almost hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the neighborhood. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu.
