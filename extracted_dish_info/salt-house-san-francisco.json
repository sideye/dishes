So be warned: if you are coming in for lunch, allow more than an hour to dine. But I'm totally cool with taking my time, because this is a special place. The food and dining experience here is something to be savored - not rushed.\n\nOur table wound up splitting some appetizers, including the refreshing citrus salad, the ahu tuna tartar with avocado/peanut sauce/potato chips, and their delicious (yet artery-clogging) Poutine - which is essentially French Fries topped with mozzarella cheese curds and short-rib gravy. All of the above items were winners. And our friendly server brought out fresh baked bread with creamy butter. Even if you hate carbs, this chewy bread is hard to pass up.\n\nThe only thing that was kind of a let-down was my main dish. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi (a Vietnamese inspired sandwich topped with sambal yuzu aioli green papaya & mango slaw). The sandwich was fine - just nothing memorable. And let's face it - for a fraction of the price, you can get a much better/more authentic Banh Mi in the Tenderlon @ Saigon Sandwich.\n\nSince it was a working lunch, we abstained from wine and ordered the Bruce Adams - a delightful Mocktail made with grapefruit, ginger, lemon, and soda water.

One thing that they have - just like every other trendy-but-out-of-business-in-two-years-restaurant-in-SOMA - is the overly-trendy sweetbreads. Really, Salt House? You couldn't find any other portion of the veal that was more disgusting to serve than brains? What...was the butthole gone or  is that not what all the hipsters are eating yet?\n\nThe portions were painfully small. These days, I'm eating less - and dinner is usually a salad or something small. These portions were about the size of a 50-cent piece...and way over-priced. The flavor was average. We ordered the chrispy shrimp for a taste. The shrimp was great...but the \"spicy green beans\" were absolutely, positively inedible. There was more cumin and cilantro than there were string beans. Note to the chef: MORE CUMIN DOES NOT MAKE A DISH MORE TASTY. It ruins the flavor when used by the bucket-full. Please - I'm sure that the tin of cumin doesn't say \"Dump entire contents into dish\" on the side label. If you're going to cook with cumin, it must, must, must be used sparingly to slightly flavor the food - not make you feel as though you've fallen face-first into Andre The Giant's armpit.\n\nWe also had the sweet corn soup, and luckily, that was quite remarkable. It was the best \n\nNow for the best part of the meal: I had the Rene Rostaing Coteaux du Languedoc, Puech Noble 2006 (white). My wife had the Sonoma Seghesio 2009 (red). Both wines were excellent, and both wines were perfect for after a long, long day.\n\nFinally -\nReservations: don't bother. You're not going to get what you want anyway. The staff isn't particularly attentive (I guess giving away reservations to other people keeps them quite busy), and they don't care if you stay there and eat or go somewhere else. It didn't seem as though the staff really cared at all. \n\nWe were told that this was a romantic place for dinner. Well, perhaps if you find standing next to a speaker at an Insane Clown Posse concert and having to yell at the top of your lungs to be heard by your date to be romantic, then Salt House is for you. The place is LOUD and I had to yell my order to the waiter and had to yell so that my wife could hear me. Come on - I'm not that old. This place was just too damn loud to be romantic.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind putting up with the indifferent waiters and don't mind the hearing damage, go try some great wine. Otherwise, try Scoma's on the Wharf.

I was neutral on the steak fry size instead of frites since it's all potato anyway.\n\nFoie Gras: I'll admit, I'm a foie gras fiend.  Most restaurants that serve it only serve either the fresh seared version or the torchon.  If by odd chance a place serves both, I'm alway tempted to get the seared.  Salt House transcends the dilemma by offering both AND two small bits of tea smoked duck breast.  The seared foie gras was awesome and I love the use of wild huckleberries in the traditional sweet contrast.  The torchon was standard, but tasty.  The duck breast was very rare and very smoky.  Definitely the Solange to the star Beyonc\u00e9 foie gras, but still quaint in small doses.\n\nPork Belly: The way I like it, cooked like over sized bacon!  There was some greenage below but I totally forgot about it while caught up in my pork frenzy.  Great crispy outsides with tender meat and soft fat inside.\n\nCassoulet: The beans were a tad large for my taste (butter beans?), but are more true to the medieval roots of cassoulet than the modern day smaller white beans.  The sausage was hearty and the duck confit was nice, but could have stood to be crispier.\n\nLemon Verbena Panna Cotta: This dessert jumped on the bandwagon of two widely popular trends in SF cuisine: lemon verbena (where was this herb a few years ago?) and the grotesque looking Buddha's hand.  Like Lady Gaga, not all popular trends are a bad thing.  The lemon verbena gave the creamy panna cotta a fresher citrus flavoring than traditional lemon/lime/orange varieties.  The Buddha's hand was thinly sliced and candied to a soft consistency floating in sugary syrup.  It gave a much more potent citrus burst which contrasted the fresh and subtle panna cotta well.\n\nBrown Sugar & Cardamom Ice Cream: This is so simple, yet so amazing and unique.  Why has no one done this before?  The brown sugar gives ice cream a very caramel and molasses tone that regular sugar can't compete with.

It was good, from what I remember.\n\nSo my only criticism?\n\nThe server didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  I asked her about the Pork Loin, and she said she didn't know what I was talking about.  I looked up the menu again.  So they have a Beeler Pork Loin and Shank, that I had been looking forward to ordering all day, but turns out the menu wasn't updated on their website.  I looked it up while there, then asked again, and she said the site is updated everyday.  And I showed her, and finally she came around and realized that I was in fact showing her the website on my phone.  She said she would mention it to the manager.  Yes, this part of the story is too long, but I looked again today a couple of weeks later, and it still hasn't been updated on the website.  They should correct this.\n\nThe only other thing was that we ordered a dessert for my friend's birthday while he was in the bathroom, as a small surprise.  Which we told our server.  He came back, and then our server came back and set all the forks down in front of us.  The surprise that we had worked all of 5 minutes on was ruined.  \n\nI sound like I hated the server.  Not the case.  I'm sure we could be best friends and travel the world solving crimes.  \n\nAnywho.  At the end of the day, Salt House is highly recommended.

However it was not busy when we went and we were seated relatively quickly.\n\nWe ate:\n\n\"yellowtail tartare\" - Why is this in quotes? Because they advertise yellowtail on the menu... yet they serve you regular tuna in the dish. Conversation with the waiter was as follows:\nme \"I'd like the yellowtail tartare\"\nserver \"Oh excellent choice the tuna tartare is very good.\"\nme \"wait, isn't it yellow tail?... hamachi right\"\nserver \"It is tuna\"\n\nI thought the guy was just confused, but no. It IS tuna tartare... not hamachi and therefore not really worth what they charged in my opinion. (That said, it was a different take on tuna tartare with the use of Asian pear.)\n\nPoutine - Pretty good, I liked it. But it's hard to fail fried items with fat (i.e. cheese). The gravy was a bit salty\n\nAutumn Salad - This was just ok to me. It was not bad, nor exceptional. Just fine, though it's something my mother would love to death.\n\nPetrole Sole - This was nothing special, although everything was cooked well. There were these little sausage like things in it, which were salty though.\n\nTai Snapper - the sauce they used for this dish was excellent, as were the chanterelle mushrooms. I would say the mushrooms were the best thing at this restaurant, I would order a plate of just that! As for the fish itself, I enjoyed the crispy skin on top and it was cooked well. Overall, it was pretty good.\n\nWhite polenta - I don't really like polenta, but I admit this was pretty tasty for poleta. The grana padano was good.\n\nShort rib - The sauce was too salty... it was full of flavor though. The short rib was cooked well, the meat was very tender.\n\nOverall... Salt House is just okay. The ingredients they use are fresh and the dishes are prepared well from a technical point of view. However, nothing screams special to me... and it is salty to boot! Maybe that's why it's called \"Salt House?\"", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-11-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Poutine!

But within 15 minutes, the place was packed! \n\nWe ordered the famous poutine for appetizer, and it was pretty good within the first couple of bites. The dish included fries with cheese and herbs. The server poured over hot gravy in front of us, which had bits of tender beef as well. It was my first time eating poutine, and it was an interesting combination. My favorite part was probably the beef bites; other than that, the fries didn't seem special, and everything felt too heavy after the first 3 bites.\n\nWe waited for about an HOUR before receiving our entrees, which was so ridiculous. My co-worker ordered the sole. I thought the sole didn't have flavor itself at all. The broth was a bit too oily for me, and didn't really compliment the fish at all. \n\nI ordered the pork shoulder and ribs. The ribs were extremely disappointing, as they were dry. There were no sauce really - it was only served with the leftover sauce from cooking it. Maybe because there wasn't excess sauce, the meat seemed dry? Doesn't really make sense, but I could only finish 1/3 of the ribs. The pork shoulder was a bit better. The pieces were way too small, but were tender. The pork shoulder was drenched in really salty sauce, and was complimented with jalapenos and this sweet white polenta. Not sure if I had polenta before, but it was pretty good at first bite. Afterwards though, it was overly sweet. Had to mix between the overly sweet polenta and the disgustingly salty sauce to get through about half of my pork shoulder. \n\nFinally, we ended with the pistachio macaron ice cream sandwich. The pistachio flavor was pretty good, and the macaron was nice and chewy. The fruits on the side was a bit too small and looked dry to me. Too bad the bottom macaron was drenched in white syrup, so it was, again, a bit too sweet for me.\n\nLastly, I wanted to note that the service was extremely terrible. Although our waitress always smiled at us, she was never attentive. She never even apologized for the extreme delay of our entrees. Our lunch ended up being TWO hours long, and we even saw the neighboring tables come and go before us. \n\nIt's sad to say that my favorite dish was the dessert.

The food has its ups and downs, but when it's good, it's DAMN good.\n\nThere's something about the way Salt House is designed that makes you feel comfortable -- it's a fancy restaurant, but possesses casual elements reminiscent of a local gastropub like Monk's Kettle or a brewery like 21st Amendment. Feels very akin to one of my favorite restaurants in the city: NOPA. We went on a Saturday night and it was packed with older, business-casual patrons -- loud, lively, and bustling with energy.\n\nOn to what really matters: the food. Our table of 4 decided to share 5 appetizers and 1 main entree, which was the perfect amount of food and gave us an opportunity to try a lot of different items on the menu. For the appetizers, we ordered the Poutine (gravy fries), Crispy Shrimp, Yellowtail Tartare, Asparagus w/ Pork Belly, and the Foie Gras plate. \n\nThe Poutine was good -- very nice touch with short rib gravy (with little chunks of short rib), but it definitely could have been a bit less salty. Taking the restaurant's name into consideration, I assume the extra salt is probably on purpose. \n\nThe crispy shrimp wasn't very good at all. To be completely honest, the fried shrimp (4 small pieces for $14) tastes exactly like the ones that you get from Panda Express or some hole-in-the-wall Chinese fast food restaurant. The green bean salad they provide in the middle is good, but not enough to justify the exorbitantly-overpriced dish.\n\nThe yellowtail tartare wasn't very good either. The chunks of yellowtail weren't very fresh and it was mixed in with too many other fruits and chunks of celery that completely overpowered the fish. Stay away from this one.\n\nThe asparagus w/ pork belly was awesome. The aspargus is perfectly grilled and the pork belly was nice and tender.\n\nThe foie gras was definitely the best dish of the night. Two types of foie gras: cured pate style and seared style. The cured foie gras was incredible -- silky, creamy, and packed in so much of that foie gras flavor. It goes well with the jelly, but don't put too much jelly in the bite, because you don't want it to overpower the foie gras. The seared foie gras was good, but not great. The seared duck salad that comes in the middle of the dish was awesome.\n\nWe also ordered a plate of the braised short rib, which was really tender and nicely cooked.  The strawberry tart for dessert was a great finish to the night, with fresh strawberries and a delicious balsamic glaze.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dinner at Salt House -- great  food, nice ambiance, delicious house wines (get the house cabernet), and attentive servers.

First of all, I originally made an online reso for four, but ended up needing two more seats. I called in and originally they said they were booked, but after double checking were happy to accommodate. \n\nWe sat, and were immediately sent out a round of bubbly for everyone. A very pleasant start to the meal. After ordering a bunch of apps, and opening one of the bottles we brought, they sent out an amuse bouche. A chilled asparagus soup, with some asparagus tempura and creme fraiche. I don't really like asparagus to begin with but I  found it fine and everyone else at the table lapped it up.\n\nOn to the apps! \n\nThe poutine (of course): I don't think I'll ever be able to come to Salt House without ordering the poutine. I mean french fries and short rib gravy... come on. Hard to beat. \n\nThe crispy shrimp with serrano ham and green beans: I've had this before and enjoy it every time, they change up the accompaniments depending on season. It was good this time, but I actually found it a bit salty this time. This is me just nit-picking, not to say it wasn't great, I just thought maybe a little heavy handed on the salt. The beans and ham complimented it perfectly.\n\nYellow Tail: I forget exactly what it was served with, maybe a soy bean and potato puree, or something similar. But it was cut perfectly, and seared beautifully. It was delicious.\n\nDuck Confit: Oh, this was probably my favorite app. It was a rillet confited. Tender and juicy, seasoned well. Amazing. \n\nThe scallops: Ok, these were amazing too. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. So good.\n\nEntrees: \n\nBetween the table, we got the short ribs, white polenta, and I got the chicken.\n\nHonestly, by this time I was already so full, it was hard for me to really appreciate anything, but I've had the short ribs and chicken before. I know they change the menu daily, but they also use similar proteins and change the other stuff seasonally. The chicken was actually a touch dryer than last time, but was still really good. Served with a delicious bacon, potato and leek puree. mmmmmmm. short ribs were excellent as always.\n\nWe were all so full by dessert time, we probably would have just order 1 or 2 for the table. Thankfully we didn't have to. They sent us out the three options I'm sure we would've picked anyway. The panna cotta, the chocolate peanut butter cake and one other thing.

So we went around the block found parking rather easily and crossed our fingers since we had no reservations. \n\nIt was filled but no one was waiting to be seated. We were informed that they were booked for the night but that they offer a full menu at the bar, and at a community table behind the bar that had ten or so stools around it and one couple enjoying a meal. We jumped at the chance to sit at the community table and were promptly taken care of.\n\nThe restaurant is nice. A little industrial with brick walls and girders but it also was warm and comfortable. \n\nWe decided to share three appetizers and one entree. This way we got to try quite a few dishes. The Poutine was the star of the meal to me. I had never seen poutine offered anywhere outside of Quebec before and this version was perfect.

All in all, a great experience!\n\nBack when we were trying to make plans for News Years Eve, I logged on to Open Table and picked Salt House simply because it was in very close proximity to the hotel my aunt and uncle were planning to stay at. Well, their reservations at the hotel fell through at the last minute, but we decided to keep our dinner plans and I'm so glad we did! \n\nWe had a few drinks down the street at Roy's beforehand, which was a smart move for me because none of the cocktails at Salt House really piqued my interest. As far as food goes, though, I was really impressed. I would say that, to start, both the poutine and the warm nuts are MUST-HAVES!!! Just do it! The marinated olives, however, were a joke...you could get better olives at the olive bar in any grocery store! \n\nFor my main dish, I got the yellowfin tuna-it was excellent, served seared, with lots of veggies on the side, and it was the perfect portion...I felt like I was eating air! Everyone else got meat dishes...my aunt really liked her short ribs. We each ordered a different dessert, and I was partial to the panna cotta, above anything else...it had a different flavor, but the consistency was so smooth!\n\nThe service was top notch. I always feel like I ask a lot of questions at restaurants, but our server filled in all the blanks at her own accord, so I didn't even have to ask, which was a nice change of pace. They served us (a really good!) complimentary champagne at midnight, and the managers went around to all the tables and toasted all the guests!

After getting a reservation two weeks in advance I wasn't about to skip out on this meal for any reason (not even the Phillies playing the Giants).\n\nSalt House far exceeded my expectations. Its set in a unique brick building with a decor of thick wood accents and fun mirrors. A communal table resides in the middle of the room (for those of you who like dining alongside complete strangers) and the kitchen is open to the main dining area so you can watch for tasty plates as they get served up.  To my surprise, the feel was casual and maybe only 15% hipster, with most diners wearing jeans.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu, we chose to go heavy on the apps and split one entree (the steak...YUM), but that's not to say the entree menu was lacking in the least. However, it turned out to be a good choice, because we got to split 4 lovely small (but not too small) plates and try a variety of tastes they had to offer.\n\nThe crab appetizer looked like a crab salad but tasted like a chunky crab cole slaw (heavy on the crab, woot!), salty of course, and enhanced by the tiny fried artichokes mixed throughout. The fresh yellowfin tuna came atop a bed of beets and some sort of gelatin mixture, but whatever it was, the result was delicious. I had never had poutine but when I learned what it entailed I knew it was right up my alley. Basically, large, fresh cheese fries with gravy and chunks of beef. Best part of the meal, by far. The crispy shrimp appetizer was just that but nothing to lament about.\n\nAs I said, we chose the steak, which was juicy and accented with small carrots, potatoes and a special sauce which made it all the better. For dessert I had the rubarb tart, which was great if you like rubarb. All around, an amazing meal and the perfect break from my two-weeks till Hawaii diet.\n\nWhen my beau asked me what I liked better, Salt House or its sister restaurant, Town Hall, I couldn't decide. And I adore Town Hall so that's saying something for this place. I'll be back for sure.\n\nAwkward Side Note: When I walked out of the bathroom stall there was a dude washing his hands in the sink.  When he saw me he didn't seem the least bit surprised. I doublechecked on the way out to be sure I hadn't swooped into the mens room after a few too many glasses of pinot, but no, I was right where I should be.

I loved it! \n\nI like Townhall.  I like a lot of restaurants but I just had one of those perfect dinners at Salt House.  The ambience is very warm with a sort of modern/rustic decor.  The food and drinks were delicious, and the service was truly outstanding.  \n\nOne of the distinguishing features of this restaurant is their service.  It was absolutely perfect.  We arrived early and the hostess was lovely! This should always be true at restaurants, and yet... I find many restaurants where the hostess is obviously stressed and seems put off by an early arrival or just too stressed in general to be warm and welcoming.  The hostess at Salt House was perfect.  She made us feel right at home, let us know the situation, and let us know she would seat us as soon as she could.  \n\nWe started at the bar sampling their cocktails (i.e., Perfect Strangers, Kentucky Heartbreak).  The drinks were good and definitely lived up to their enticing names.  After a drink, or two, we moved to our table.  We went upstairs which is a bit small but super cozy, and now my favorite place to sit in the restaurant despite loving the communal table.  Our waitress was superlative.  She was warm and welcoming, she helped us with our selections, and she was super attentive when we wanted her, and yet she gave us plenty of space when we were busy talking.  At a nice restaurant you expect great service, but more times than not, it's just good.  At Salt House we felt taken care of, and it was really nice.  \n\nThe food was great.  The bread is obviously baked on site and it's definitely worth the calories.  For starters the cucumber salad was light and delicious.  The poutine, on the other hand, was ridiculously heavy but so, so good.  In fact, next time I am sad, I am going to drown my sorrows with poutine and a big glass of red wine at Salt House.  The entrees were all great too.  The presentation was lovely, the portion size was good (I hate it when I spend more than $25 on an entree and then leave hungry), and everything was tastey.  After drinks, wine, and dinner we were pretty full but we still managed to split a summer peach pie.  Just imagine a little pie baked to golden brown perfection.  Now imagine the taste of warm, flaky crust, peaches and homemade ice cream in your mouth.  Yes, it was good.\n\nOverall, I had one of those perfect dinners at Salt House.

The restaurant is situated next to a major construction site, so walking there at night isn't the most scenic.\n\nWhen we walk in, the place is packed. The front window is large and there is a small bar/ledge table that two people were sitting at, so we assumed it was a waiting area. When we asked for a table, the friendly receptionist told us we could sit at the window and eat. We asked if we were \"good enough\" to sit in the window and she assured us we fit the bill. ;)\n\nSo here's the part where I think I'm so cool. Sitting at the window, you see everyone walking in and out of the place and on the sidewalk. At one point, there's a group of businessmen who have just left the restaurant and are standing in front of me talking. One of them looks familiar, but I can't place him and then it dawns on me, it's Willie Brown. Now, this is exciting to me because you know how many times I've read reviews of SF restaurants and people write that Willie was at the table next to them? Lots. But I get to write a review that says Willie Brown was standing in front of me and looked right at me and winked.  How's that?!?\n\nBesides the Willie experience, the food was great. We ordered a bunch of appetizers with the theme being to order things we had never tried or heard of before. I had heard of poutine, but wasn't sure if I had eaten it, so that was a given. We had to get the foie gras, ricotta salad and pork belly. Awesome. Everything was presented well and really, I do not think our service was affected by the fact that we weren't facing the restaurant.\n\nOur waitress and the receptionist came by frequently to talk and visit with us, they were really friendly.\n\nIronically, I ate at TownHall the following night and I have to say The Salt House blows TownHall away in ambience and a great dining experience.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-01-26"}, {"excerpts": ["the poutine was quite tasty.

I ordered a sauvignon blanc and the tuna, and my wine was long since warm by the time the tuna came out.

But, I see on Craigslist that they are adding a line cook, so maybe the slowness problem is about to be fixed!\n\nOther than those two gripes, which cost 1 star each, everything was excellent. I enjoyed the tuna, but not as much as I enjoyed a bite of the lamb, which my boyfriend ordered. GET THE LAMB. I also really enjoyed the chili cheese fries, UM, ER, I MEAN, the poutine.

I have previously been a big fan of this establishment, having enjoyed its food and style many times over the years.  This last visit was sad enough that I feel obligated to review it negatively.  The hostess was disorganized, rude and unfriendly when we showed up, on time, for our reservation. Despite the presence of a half dozen empty tables. the Hostess sat several folks who arrived after us, including walk-ins, had time to chat with the bar patrons and was barely able to speak to us long enough to ask us to wait, three times. Apparently, we didn't seem eligible or interesting enough to merit her attentions, unlike the young men at the bar she was fawning over shamelessly.  It was as if we annoyed her by being there.  \n\nOnce we were seated, the wait staff failed to notice us for quite a while. When the waiter finally did approach our table, he was obviously put out that only two of us were drinking alcohol - his attitude got somewhat unpleasant and dismissive.  He made absolutely no attempt to describe the food, engage us in any way or answer simple questions about the food.   He seemed so very sad and bored, a feeling we also got from the busboys, the cooks , the bartender ... the whole place seemed surly and depressed.  \n\nThe waiter only managed to show up twice more through the rest of the meal.  He wandered by once, dispiritedly asking \"how was everything?\" in a mumble without looking up.  He took our orders, then disappeared for parts unknown, leaving the delivery of the food to others.  Towards the end of the meal, he briefly showed his face, slapped a few desert menus down on the dirty table and stalked off without comment.  \n\nThe food itself was not as good as it has previously been - overcooked, dropped onto the tables without concern, plated sloppily and really somewhat bland other than the preponderance of salt on the meat and fish courses. The Poutine, for which they are somewhat known, was a massive disappointment - I had talked it up to the other couple dining with us, having enjoyed it a great deal in the past.  The fries were overcooked badly, the cheese was melted haphazardly over one half of the plate, leaving the other side bare and the gravy was cold and congealed.  First time we've ever left fries on the plate ... \n\nIt seems they've toned down the menu, almost certainly lost their old chef and have apparently refocused on being a local bar that serves food, no longer a restaurant with a bar.  For what it's worth, the the drink I ordered was not well made at all, watered down terribly, and not even filling the glass.  From where we sat, we could see the bartender work and I watched with a certain envy as the bar-side regulars got very long pours in their glases while our table got weak, overpriced drinks.  \n\nWe felt ignored, unwelcome from the moment we walked in to the moment we left.  For the price, this is no longer a good restaurant. It cost us $250 to eat there, a slightly higher than average price by local standards - in all honesty, the food and service didn't merit that price point.

I've read about how loud this place can get but it was very quiet when we began our meals, albeit it did get louder as the night wore on and carafes of wine started flowing like, well, wine.  Even though the tables were close together the high ceilings made it possible to have an intimate conversation.   There is also a cool upstairs deck thing that looks fun to sit on.\n\nSERVICE:  I don't know how to describe the service here in eloquent words so I'll stick with awesome.  The FOH staff always seemed to be there when we needed them and away when we didn't.  Our server was very nice and wasn't bad to look at either. ; )  She wasn't too forward or too quiet and was very friendly and approachable.  \n--My only issue is that there was no specials for the night.  This is not a huge deal but I was looking forward to something off the menu.  I don't think it's too much to ask when you are paying $40-50 per head.\n\nDRINKS:  We had a carafe of their red wine blend.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't too good either.  Then again I don't expect much from house poured blends to begin with.\n\nFOOD:  We started with the Poutine and the squid.  Both of the dishes were marvelous and well portioned.  The broth that came with the squid was on the salty side though which kind of hurt it.  We also had the braised short rib which was good but not great.  I had the duarta river salmon with potatoes and pureed leeks.  The salmon was amazing and they even left the skin on!  Nothing like some nice crispy fish skin.  The leek puree was out of this world too.  Minus points-- the potato vegetable dish that was served next to the salmon was way too salty.  I mean I know this place is called the Salthouse, but they may be taking their name a tad too literally.\n\nOverall:  I wanted to give this place 3 stars to be honest but the ambiance and service bumped it up a star.  Also, I think the salthouse can be a 4-5 start place if they tone the salt down and start offering specials that highlight seasonal ingredients and exude innovation and creativity.\n  I would definitely go back soon, but only for apps and drinks since I'm pretty broke as of current.\n\nHappy eating you weirdos!", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-11-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The only thing I would recommend is the poutine.

I didn't know what to expect from a place named after a spice or even a place tucked away next to Roy's. When you walk in, you see how deep the restaurant really is. In the front, there are stairs that lead up to an elevated balcony/platform with additional tables. The ceilings are high and the beams exposed. The walls are exposed brick and the tabletops remind me of thick maple butcher's blocks. There's a bar along the right side of the restaurant and behind that, an open kitchen. You get the feeling that you really are in a Salt House (whatever that may be). I really liked the way the space was laid out.\n\nPerusing over the menu, I was immediately drawn to the Pomegranate Refresher (pomegranate/cranberry juice, simple syrup, fresh lemon, and soda). I'm usually not one for Pomegranate drinks, but my curiousity was piqued and I'm glad I took a chance on it. It was delicious. Crisp, refreshing, not too sweet, like drinking some sparkling jam. We then moved on to the appetizers, the DAT menu came with a Beet and Blue Cheese Salad and I also ordered the Foie Gras Torchon (get it while you can, it'll be gone in 2012 thanks to those damn tree huggers). OrangeJenn went with the Trout and Citrus Salad while my other companion JLau went with the Poutine (French Fries topped with cheddar and gravy). Beet and Cheese salad was excellent, I hate it when the cheese overpowers everything else or if the beets are overcooked. Neither was the case here. The julienned D'anjou pears added to the texture and sweetened the plate a bit. The Trout Salad paired trout (usually a bold flavor) with citrus (orange and grapefruit) which really married well with the fish. I only had a few bites, but I wanted more. The poutine was only ok and a little heavy for me. Potatoes, gravy, and cheddar all in one plate. I'd avoid it again next time. The Foie Gras Torchon featured quince and apple butter. The tartness of the quince tempered the intenseness of the Foie Gras and at the end of the bite, the  taste of apple butter was left lingering on the palette, making each bite better than the last.\n\nFor our entrees, OrangeJenn got the Beef Brisket Chili, JLau got the Salt House Burger (Medium) and I got the Posole of Pork Shoulder. The Chili was only ok, nothing to jump for joy about. She thought the brisket would kick it up, but it didn't. The chili came with a side of grilled cheese (smoked gouda) which turned out to be better than the chili itself. JLau liked his burger, but I noticed it was cooked closer to Medium Well  than Medium and the accompanying finely sliced onion rings seemed to clump and were a little greasy. My own Pork Posole was a whole other matter. The Pork Shoulder was cooked to tender perfection, as if it had been stewed for hours. Coupled with the garbanzo beans and the bold sauce, all that was needed was some heat, readily provided by tossing in the accompanying pickled red and green jalapenos. I was in heaven. Spoonful after spoonful, I soaked up all the varied flavors and texture, leaving behind only an empty plate.\n\nFor dessert,  the DAT came with a Brown Butter Blondie, Butterscotch Gelato, and Maple Cream. This was the perfect ending to the meal. The Blondie was dense and flavorful and went well with the gelato. I couldn't really taste the maple in the cream and I thought the chocolate sauce on the bottom was a little too dark and bitter. All in all, I was impressed with this place. My only caveat to anyone wanting to try this place is to stay away from all the plates that sound heavy initially. Stick with the lighter stuff and you won't be disappointed.

I love these restaurants that blend old rustic charm with modern decorative elements.  \n\nAs we perused the menu we decided there were more interesting appetizers than there were entrees so we agreed to get about 6-7 apps and share one entree.  We started off with the shellfish plateau which was a melange of oysters, clams, mussels, and peeled cooked shrimp on a mound of ice served in a large stainless steel mixing bowl.  The seafood was fresh and delicious.  The 6 appetizers we ordered included Poutine (steak frites w/ short rib gravy), Cauliflower soup, Crispy Shrimp (served over spicy green beans, almonds and serrano ham), Yellowfin Tuna (seared and served with leeks and a green garlic truffle vinaigrette), Suckling Pig (served w/ lentils and roasted garlic, and Foie Gras (both seared and torchon).  The one entree we ordered to share was their grilled hanger steak (figured \"eh\" we don't have a beef dish yet).\n\nI really enjoyed having the variety of different appetizers rather than your traditional 3 or 4 course meal.  It really gave us a true sense of the \"new American\" cuisine that the Salt House offers.  The Salt House is the second restaurant of the founders of Town Hall.  From my recollection of eaten at Town Hall on 2 other occasions, I like the ambience and the food offerings of Salt House better.

There were four visibly empty tables, and yet for reasons unbeknown to us, the hostess decided the table wasn't ready and told us to start with drinks at the bar.  After 9:10pm she seated us at one of tables that had been empty all along.  That was one of many instances in the evening that didn't make sense.  Another example followed at the bar when I apparently upset the bartender because I wanted to pay for the drinks.  He took my card without saying a word and traipsed off to the other end of the dining room.  Shortly after being seated at our table, he returned my card to me without a word.  Sadly, that wasn't the only confusion with my credit card - I was later charged for my part of the final bill as well as a friend's part of the bill.    \n\nAs the dining room started to clear around 10pm, there was a notable difference in the demeanor of the staff.  The mildly aloof servers and the manager seemed to catch a second wind and pep up.  Unfortunately, they used that energy to leave us painfully unattended so they could consume their dinners in the back stairwell.  When our server returned to our table, she was still wiping her mouth of the food she had just devoured.  \n\nBut, I can't entirely blame them, since the food is quite good.

I can't recall what else we had which is usually means I wasn't blown away.  \n\nTwo things bugged me about the servers: they didn't announce the menu items they brought to the table (I know it is kinda lame, but I like it), the second is that they kept serving our dishes over the divider between the kitchen and our table.  I mean honestly, you can't walk around the partition to properly serve my dinner?  I thought that was borderline rude.\n\nI love the space and will mostly likely return, but probably for drinks/apps at the bar, not dinner.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-01-08"}, {"excerpts": ["The Poutine (a French-Canadian dish) was quite good.

It included a fair number of mussels, clams and shrimp in a buttery aioli-type sauce with fingerling potatoes. My wife's dish includes a carrot side that was spiced with Moroccan spices and topped with a mint chutney. It was quite good, but her fish was woefully under-salted.\n\nThe service was somewhat lackluster. We got menus and bread right away, but then our waiter seemed to forget about us. We actually had to call him over to the table to take our order. I really wish waiters would read your body language and tell that you want to order. Once the food was ordered things seemed to flow fairly smoothly. \n\nI liked the decor, and the prices were steep (1 appetizer, 2 mains, no drinks = $56 before tip), but not any more so than the typical upscale place in that area and we did order two of the more expensive mains.

With little shavings of jamon serrano, almonds, green beans and fresh greens, it was a lovely plate of food. . .the beans had a slightly spicy finish that I really enjoyed.   The foie gras was also a lovely plate - one coin of torchon and a small piece of expertly sauteed foie with a couple of thin slices of tea smoked duck breast that was flavorful and juicy.  \n\nDining out with civilians (i.e. non-restaurant type people) is sometimes taxing.  There are rules, dammit. . as in if you have a party of six that means you get to try SIX DIFFERENT entrees - huzzah for big parties!!!!  Well, boo for this one because four of those fools ordered the same thing.  WHAT?!?!?  Don't y'all know how to eat?!??!  Phooey!  (I know, I am sounding quite high maintenance, aren't I?). . .  So we had four orders of the Petrale Sole, I ordered the Fulton Valley chicken, and the person seated next to me ordered the New York Steak.  That chicken shall be what I judge all other chicken from now on.  An airline breast (which means it's the whole, boneless breast with the little wing drumette) and boneless thigh meat seasoned and seared to juicy perfection - it was perfectly executed.  With a creamy spinach puree, black trumpet mushrooms, roasted rutabaga and little tiny sticks of crispy bacon.   The steak, oh the steak, was also quite lovely.  Sliced and cooked to  perfect medium rare atop roasted sunchokes, Brussels sprouts with a little bonus piece of mustard crusted short rib.  At first, when I saw that little piece of short rib, I thought it was incongruous to the rest of the plate - it didn't seem to fit but it was so good. . .tender and well seasoned - the mustard crust off-setting the richness of the meat perfectly.  Besides, they gotta get that short rib gravy somewhere and what a great way to use the gravy dividend!  The four petrale sole eaters where also very happy.  A beautifully bronzed  portion of fish with clams, a delicately spiced red wine jus and the most delicious salsify puree - you never see salsify on a menu so that's one bonus but to have it so deftly prepared is wonderful.  I got stabbed with a fork for going in for one too many bites of that puree!  OUCH!\n\nMy mom loved her bread pudding and it was nice. . buttery and not too sweet.  The mint chip ice cream sandwiches would have been better if they had not used so many mini-chips in the ice cream. . I know, I am complaining about TOO MUCH chocolate?  But it was hard to eat - the flavor of the ice cream itself was great but perhaps more like a stracchiatella would have been nice.  The birthday boy got the Bittersweet Chocolate Cremeux - essentially a giant ball of smooth ganache atop a piece of genoise.  He kept saying \"he couldn't possibly finish it all\" as he CLEANED his plate. . this was my favorite dessert, too.  The pear/french toast dessert was not as well conceived as each component - it just didn't come together well but I loved the idea of brown butter ice cream!  The panna cotta was a little too tight for my liking but I loved the idea of the fennel fronds on the dessert. . .anyone who knows me knows that I have a personal vendetta on desserts with the ubiquitous mint leaves. . .. if it doesn't have mint in the dessert please for the love of Lenotre, leave off the mint leaves!  \n\nAll in all a great night - excellent food, deft service and happy friends.  \n\nStreet cred intact!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-01-22"}, {"excerpts": ["For appetizer (not on dine about town menu) we got the famous poutine, which had rather simple ingredients, but was very delicious.

"], "author": "Laura 'jinx.tv' K.", "review": "It's hard to walk down the streets of San Francisco without tripping over a good restaurant, and that's exactly what happened to us on the way back from some Commonwealth Club Yelp talk thingy. While walking to the parking lot we discovered Salt House. (Great parking lot right there, something like $10 for four hours. A steal compared to a lot of San Francisco lots.) The place looked inviting, so we wandered in.\n\nFor schlubs like us with no reservation, there was a half hour wait for a table (7:30pm on a Thursday), but they did have some first come, first serve seating at the bar, at a communal table (which looked pretty cool, if a bit cramped) and at the window.\n\nNow, when you think window seating, don't think romantic little tables in a prime spot, it's like they squeezed a shelf into the window behind the staircase leading up to their enticing looking upstairs area...you have to duck under the staircase to get to your seat, and once they found us another chair, we joined four other patrons also dining on the window \"shelf\".\n\nPlease don't think I'm complaining, it was kind of cool and the staff were really good about checking up on us and giving us good service even though they had to squeeze under the stairs and contort themselves to wait on us from behind our backs. The only part I didn't like about this seating, as the only one there with a skirt on, was that our legs, probably my cootch, or whatever, were exposed under the table, through the window, and somewhat elevated, for all passers-by to gape at. A tablecloth or some sort of window covering for the area below the shelf would be a nice touch. Who knows, maybe they feel it makes the place look more inviting? (It may depend on what exactly is being exposed there, and who your target audience is. And, it didn't make me feel any better when some jerk on his parked moped across the street turned on his high-power headlight, pointed it at the restaurant and just left it there for about five minutes.)\n\nOh yeah, and we had some food! That's why I'm writing a review, and probably why you're reading it.\n\nI was worried when we first got the menu. The wine list looked very promising, but the short-ish menu had NO vegetarian entrees. No worries, though...they made me a special vegetarian entree including \"the vegetables they have that day with a starch\". The starch was barley, which I love, and my dish was very creamy and delicious. I tried to tell myself that the creaminess was from the barley, but it may just have been cooked in a crapload of butter. It was topped with some curly greens which I would normally just push aside, but they had a tasty, lemoney vinegarette on them that made me want to eat every bit of food on my plate (which I don't normally do. No, really!)\n\nWe also had some delicious poutine, although of course I asked for the gravy to be on the side, so technically it wasn't really poutine any more. There were also some tasty, tasty olives that were highly seasoned with something like lime, chili and rosemary (or was it thyme?) and my bf had the lamb which he said was quite good.\n\nFor dessert, we had the apple turnovers with rum raisin ice cream. It tasted like a little slice of Thanksgiving, totally delicious! The rum raisins make it seem like you have a bit of apple AND a bit of mincemeat. The cheese course was also a nice surprise...I ordered the sheep camembert for $6 and because of the price I was expecting what I've had at other restaurants; a miniscule portion of cheese with a tiny garnish on a huge plate (I'm looking at you, Marche in Menlo Park) but instead received two nice little wedges along with some seasoned, croutoned bread slices.\n\nThis restaurant reminds me of why we go to so much trouble to go eat in San Francisco sometimes. They got everything right, from the service to the perfectly portioned and seasoned, interesting menu items and awesome wine list. Even the price is competitive for the food/ambiance/location. \n\nI have no hesitation in giving this restaurant five stars based on MY experience here, however I thought I'd mention that the noise level is a bit high (it didn't bother my bf, though) and the people seated to one side of us arrived some time before us but didn't receive their entrees until we were having dessert. They didn't seem too put out about whatever the problem was, though...their server brought them a couple complementary bowls of soup to make up for the wait and they slurped up every last drop.\n\nNext Commonwealth Club event, I have a feeling we'll be back here again.

Of course, a couple of my clients had other ideas, and my CrackBerry got me out of bed for good about 8:30. So I figured I'd be a good hubby and meet the wife for lunch in the FiDi.\n\nWe chose Salt House for 3 reasons: First, a serious foodie friend of mine RAVED about the joint when it opened, Second, it's right around the corner from the wife's office, and Third, they were serving a price fixe lunch as part of the SF Dine About Town. To my delight, I was able to score an 11:45am reservation on Open Table around 9ish, and set out into the now sunny SF morning (seriously, is Mother Nature battling PMS or something?!?) to catch the Muni limo to head downtown.\n\nWe walked in around 11:50, and the place was empty. I guess that's par for the course on a holiday, as most of my mates were still up in Tahoe themselves for the long weekend. It did start to pick up around 12:30, but there were still plenty of free tables when we left around 1. To their credit, both our hostess and waiter went out of their way to tell the wife and I about the D.A.T. special, and our friendly waiter did not at all make us feel out of place (read: ghetto) for taking advantage of the deal like some places in town (I'm talking to you Ruth's Chris! Get over you're effin self!). Salt House kicks off every meal with fresh, crusty bread from the wonderful Acme Bread Co. in the Ferry Building with house-whipped butter, which for the carb-addicted like yours truly made a wonderful starter in and of itself. As part of the price fixe menu, I had the pork pozole, a hearty stew of braised pork shoulder with chickpeas, pickled carrots and onions, and jalapenos. The stew was absolutely phenomenal, with the succulent pork melting in your mouth as the chickpeas exploded with flavor with each and every bite. The charming gay couple next to us both ordered the same, and I overheard one of them mentioning that he detected the flavor of fresh saffron in the complex broth. I devoured the entire bowl, and even though the portion was more than generous for lunch, the pozole was so delicious I was left craving seconds. The wife had the Salt House burger, an expertly cooked patty of pure perfection topped with cheddar cheese and onion straws served on a fresh Acme Bread roll. The burger was so juicy, my wife literally had juices running down BOTH her arms! She said it was definitely one of the best burgers she's had in the FiDi, hands down. The burger is not served with fries, which I guess is all the better if you order the famous poutine as an app. It wasn't offered on the price fixe menu, and as we took it a little easy on the drinking yesterday, we decided to pass for now, but will definitely be back after a few happy hour pints to give the poutine a try.\n\nThe price fixe lunch was served with only 1 choice, the Meyer Lemon panna cotta, for dessert. I decided to pass as I'm not big on sweets in the middle of the day, but wifey really enjoyed the subtly sweet vanilla custard, which was topped with fragrant candied Meyer lemons and served in a pool of raspberry sauce. Salt House has a decent wine and beer list, with Trumer Pils, Anchor Steam, Dogfish Head IPA and Widmer Hefeweizen on tap. Our tab came out to $67 including drinks and tip, not too bad for a place that on a normal weekday is filled with power lunchers with expense accounts and the like. All told, the Salt House is a solid FiDi joint that is worth the little splurge. We'll definitely be back the next time my clients decide that I don't deserve a day off during the week.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Any place that serves poutine (fries with gravy & cheese curds) will always win a place in my heart.

We try for every month (doesn't always happen) and take turns choosing where to dine. This month it was at Salt House. We originally had a reservation for 6 but our smaller party of 4 arrived a little early and fortunately were seated within minutes. That was a plus. Service for water and wine was good - we got a couple recs and she gave us time to look at the menu. I am 5 months pregnant so I just went with the white house blend - 6 oz for $6. I drank about 2oz of it (just wanted a taste) and the others finished the rest. \n\nWe started with the crispy shrimps - very tasty breaded shrimps over spicy green beans and the Poutine - thicker fries drizzled with cheese, then they pour some gravy on them at your table. Everyone loved these 2 dishes! The others - baked oysters which I am not a fan of and the Calamari - one large tube stuffed atop a bowl of tentacles and diced accoutrements (I remember the garbanzos as I only tried these non-squid bits. It could have been good but just wasn't appetizing to me). We were mixed on the apps.\n\nDinner. We usually clean our plates and sample what the others ordered. One ordered the steak ($30) medium and it came out medium rare at most. He ate around the edges of some pieces and overall most of the dish was uneaten. One ordered the tuna ($28) and got a gristly piece. He was trying to cut through it to much disappointment. One ordered the Sole and thought it was good - everything was cooked right and so she got to enjoy her dinner and ate most of it. Upon ordering the salmon, I was asked how I wanted it cooked. I have only been asked this once before - usually I like my salmon cooked but not dry. I guess I could have said that but I was put off by the question thinking I had to answer it like ordering meat. She asked if Med Rare was ok, and being pregnant, I said at least Medium, thinking it would be ok and more cooked than not. When my fish arrived, it was pretty rare, like seared because it was mushy and raw pretty much all the way through. I had a couple bites and gave a huge raw piece from the middle to the steak eater. As I picked through it and got others to try it, everyone noticed how raw it really was. After much hesitation I sent the half piece back on a small plate to be cooked more. By the time it returned about 10 mins later (in a smaller dish on a new bed of sides, everyone had pretty much finished their dinner (or what they wanted of it) and I was practically eating alone. I had a couple more bites and decided that I wasn't into any more for the evening, I would take it home. \n\nWhen the server came around, I compared a raw piece left on my friend's plate to a cooked piece and just asked out of curiosity about the differences in cooking temp. She seemed a bit defensive but I was merely asking for information - again, not used to that question for salmon. She said the piece was Med Rare, why? I reminded her that I asked for at least Medium. Anyway, that was for info only - she didn't cook it, the kitchen did. But how did she write up the order?\n\nThe busser came around and I asked for my fish to go, just as my friend was saying just I should just eat it. I said no, I would just take it home, so my friend then asks for a box. The busser took some dishes and came back for the rest, getting mine last. I did not remind him that I still wanted to take it home but that it was ready for him to take. I think there was a language barrier so I really should have?\n\nThe chocolate dessert was tasty and at least we could end the meal sharing that.\n\nWhen the server brought our bill, she mentioned that she took the salmon off. That was appreciated. Even splitting the bill 4 ways and somehow including a 20% tip, each share was still $58. I expressed I didn't feel good about this bill, and everyone else said they didn't really eat theirs either. Point. Way too much $$ for such a disappointing meal from the kitchen. Most dishes were over salted and no one cleaned their plate which was definitely a first.\n\nMy leftover salmon??? I really thought the busser would remember that we asked for my salmon to go but it never appeared back at our table. It was about half of my $25 salmon with pretty much all the new mini diced sides and puree that I was looking forward to giving the chance the next day. Even though it got comped, I am still entitled to it right?

Edited by KenMac.\nDate: 3/21/07\n\nI've wanted to try the Salt House for a few months and when a friend said they wanted to try it as well I no longer had any excuses. Though I wish I did.  I've been to Town Hall and since \"the Jackasses\" from Town Hall opened this location I expected a similar experience.  Our meal began with a couple of small plates.  My dining partner started with the Crispy Shrimp w/ Spicy Greens, Serrano Ham and Almonds ($13). This dish was simply overpowered by the heat of the greens/ham/almond mixture the shrimp rested on.  I suggest ordering the greens as a side dish w/o shrimp. I ordered the Poutine (a Canadian dish similar to gravy fries) w/ Short Rib Gravy and Fontina cheese ($10)  I was looking forward to this dish because crispy potatoes covered in gravy is one of my comfort foods. Unfortunately, the potatoes were limp, just like Bob Dole before taking a tab of Viagra. Needless to say anytime one eats at a restaurant and you start comparing your small plates to erectile dysfunction it does not bode well for their future.\n\nOn to the on trays, I mean entres. My friend had the Fresh Dungeness Crab Salad ($21) I have to say considering the outrageous price one pays for crab in this town, this was a bargain! The crab was piled high and deep, so much so that my foodie friend couldn't finish it. Though, that may have been the result of too many pieces of bread dipped into the Short Rib Gravy.  I had the Roasted Pork \"Cubano\" Sandwich ($15) while the bread was toasted to perfection and the pork was flavorful, the remoulade that accompanied it was lackluster ultimately destroying what could have been the best \"Cubano\" sandwich I've had in this country! If I were to go back I would ask for the sauce they put on their Spicy Greens instead of the remoulade. \n\nMiscellaneous issues!\nFirst, be forewarned, if you've been to Town Hall then you know it can be quite loud. The Salt House is even louder. I imagine that the tall exposed ceilings plus the narrowness of the building itself amplifies the internal din to a cacophony of clangs/clutter and talking.  Our waiter was overly enthusiastic about clearing plates of food while we were still eating (extremely annoying).  Please note these comments are specific to a lunchtime meal and not dinner.\n\nI would recommend this place with the caveats explained above. The food, while searching for a place on the palette, is good!  Just remember it is very LOUD at lunch!\n\n\nAddendum: I returned to Salt House on 4/18/07 for lunch and while the counter staff was very knowledgeable, the food has taken a turn for the worse. I ordered the White Bean Soup ($9) the soup was creamy, yet bland. Perhaps a twist or two of cracked black pepper would have helped but I doubt it. I then had the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare w/ Bosc Pear and Red/Golden Beets ($14) which I regret to say was a horrible combination. The tuna was flesh was a milky pink not the deep red that one sees in better restaurants in the city (think Aqua, Michael Mina). I've never tasted anything like this anywhere. I'm a huge fan of all things tuna but I would NEVER eat this dish ever again.\n\nI no longer recommend this restaurant.

When I'm in Vancouver, I always make sure to get some poutine.  This is the first place in the States that I've heard serves the dish.  I rounded up a bunch of coworkers and went to Salt House during the DAT season.  The DAT menu was only okay so only about half of us ordered off of that.  We also ordered some poutines and sliders to share as appetizers.  Poutine was pretty good.  They used beef short rib gravy to fancy things up but at the end of the day it was still just fries with cheese and gravy.  Not even close to being worth the $11 per small portion.  My pork shoulder dish was pretty good because it came with some pickled vegetables that spiced up the dish and gave it a bit of a tangy offset to the smooth gravy.  Also, a coworker knew the general manager who then sent up a few desserts to try.  The chocolate one with almonds was by far my favorite!  I remember when the DAT lunch  menu used to come with 3 courses and they were usually kitchen highlights that would cause people to come back.  Now they've started cheaping out with 2 courses and sub-par items that are probably cheaper to make.  I think DAT's reputation is going to go down the tubes soon and people will stop trying restaurants under this pretense.  Most of the time I don't even order off the DAT menu anymore.

I arrived way before the rest of the group, sidled up to the bar and ordered the usual double. I couldn't help it, but I started to eavesdrop on the couple next to me.... It turns out they were both in town for the Macworld thing and making overtly flirtatious introductions. I tried really hard not to laugh but.... from what I gathered they had literally just met. (right there at the bar before I walked in) and this guy was on a mission! he was using every cheesy line known to man. The hilarious part was, this girl was taking it in like a starving man at an all-you-can-eat buffet in vegas at 3am. She was gazing at him with fascinated eyes, a huge cheerleader smile plastered to her face and doing a high pitched girly laugh. I was totally mesmerized at the whole scene unfolding.... Damn, and then my group showed up so I had to leave for our table. so sadly I'm not exactly sure how it all turned out....  but if I had to GUESS I would say it was probably wild monkey sex in one of their respective hotel rooms.

We had reservations for 9 but ended up getting there at 9:30.  Reason being our friends flight was delayed and she arrived late.  I notified the hotel concierge of this and he told me he would contact the restaurant of the delay.  We end up getting there and the hostess tells us we should hae been on time or let them know we were going to be late.  I told her the concierge at the hotel called in.  She refutes this by saying no hotel called.  Then comes a manager, a nice friendly lady in a suit jacket greets me by my last name, and apologizes for the rudeness of the hostess.  She told me she got the call from the concierge and was waiting for my arrival.  How awesome is that? \n\nWe end up sitting up stairs which is great, you get a view of the restaurant.  It's a bit crowded down stairs so I highly recommend dining upstairs for a more intimate setting.  Our server comes and we ordered Poutine, which is AMAZING.  Hot fluffy french fries, covered in melted sharp white cheddar, and drenched in a nice warm beef gravy.  MMMMM.  And then I ask the server to recommend a white wine.

Coming in they had interesting business cards and menus that makes the restaurant classier. The host seated us right away because we had reservations. \n*A tip would be to make reservations especially during lunch/dinner rushes. \nThe seating of the restaurant is a little tight that creates a loud environment. I would not suggest to bring someone here if you wanted a private conversation.\nThe hard walls and ceilings create the restaurant noise to not leave the room which makes you have to speak up to talk to the person next to you. The service was also good. We did not have a problem with them. They were kind and professional but you do need to ask for bread, they won't just put it on your table.\nI will also like to add that the kitchen is open and can be seen while eating which makes for some entertainment. There is also a bar and upstairs seating which adds more value to the restaurant \n\nOn to the food, I ordered the \"Carnitas Tacos\" and they were pretty good. It's not amazing but when you put your salsa on them that's where they get good. They also come with a side of chips which make for a delightful side. These tacos aren't your usual run of the mill tacos from a taco stand they have a little more glam to them. \n\nWith the Carnitas Tacos I also ordered the \"Salt House Burger\" and that was great. Places that are more modern and are trying to be fancy sometimes can't make a burger well.

Be sure to ask for it to be cooked how you would like.\nThe burger came with fries that were pretty salty, no pun intended. But they did taste better than I expected and made my burger that much better. \n\nI also had the Chocolate Mousse for dessert, it tasted average but the the design of it was laid out like a snake which made it look more interesting and fancy. You would expect mousse to be not displayed like that which makes it significant but it did have these chocolate and white chocolate balls that tasted good that added a crunch to it.\n\nOverall the restaurant would be a great place if you are in the area for lunch or going to take coworkers out. The only cons I would say is that that restaurant is pricey and would probably go to the extent say over pricey because 3 tacos should never cost you 16 dollars or a burger and fries should not cost you 17 dollars. It is also on the louder side.

I didn't know what to expect from a place named after a spice or even a place tucked away next to Roy's. When you walk in, you see how deep the restaurant really is. In the front, there are stairs that lead up to an elevated balcony/platform with additional tables. The ceilings are high and the beams exposed. The walls are exposed brick and the tabletops remind me of thick maple butcher's blocks. There's a bar along the right side of the restaurant and behind that, an open kitchen. You get the feeling that you really are in a Salt House (whatever that may be). I really liked the way the space was laid out.\n\nPerusing over the menu, I was immediately drawn to the Pomegranate Refresher (pomegranate/cranberry juice, simple syrup, fresh lemon, and soda). I'm usually not one for Pomegranate drinks, but my curiousity was piqued and I'm glad I took a chance on it. It was delicious. Crisp, refreshing, not too sweet, like drinking some sparkling jam. We then moved on to the appetizers, the DAT menu came with a Beet and Blue Cheese Salad and I also ordered the Foie Gras Torchon (get it while you can, it'll be gone in 2012 thanks to those damn tree huggers). OrangeJenn went with the Trout and Citrus Salad while my other companion JLau went with the Poutine (French Fries topped with cheddar and gravy). Beet and Cheese salad was excellent, I hate it when the cheese overpowers everything else or if the beets are overcooked. Neither was the case here. The julienned D'anjou pears added to the texture and sweetened the plate a bit. The Trout Salad paired trout (usually a bold flavor) with citrus (orange and grapefruit) which really married well with the fish. I only had a few bites, but I wanted more. The poutine was only ok and a little heavy for me. Potatoes, gravy, and cheddar all in one plate. I'd avoid it again next time. The Foie Gras Torchon featured quince and apple butter. The tartness of the quince tempered the intenseness of the Foie Gras and at the end of the bite, the  taste of apple butter was left lingering on the palette, making each bite better than the last.\n\nFor our entrees, OrangeJenn got the Beef Brisket Chili, JLau got the Salt House Burger (Medium) and I got the Posole of Pork Shoulder. The Chili was only ok, nothing to jump for joy about. She thought the brisket would kick it up, but it didn't. The chili came with a side of grilled cheese (smoked gouda) which turned out to be better than the chili itself. JLau liked his burger, but I noticed it was cooked closer to Medium Well  than Medium and the accompanying finely sliced onion rings seemed to clump and were a little greasy. My own Pork Posole was a whole other matter. The Pork Shoulder was cooked to tender perfection, as if it had been stewed for hours. Coupled with the garbanzo beans and the bold sauce, all that was needed was some heat, readily provided by tossing in the accompanying pickled red and green jalapenos. I was in heaven. Spoonful after spoonful, I soaked up all the varied flavors and texture, leaving behind only an empty plate.\n\nFor dessert,  the DAT came with a Brown Butter Blondie, Butterscotch Gelato, and Maple Cream. This was the perfect ending to the meal. The Blondie was dense and flavorful and went well with the gelato. I couldn't really taste the maple in the cream and I thought the chocolate sauce on the bottom was a little too dark and bitter. All in all, I was impressed with this place. My only caveat to anyone wanting to try this place is to stay away from all the plates that sound heavy initially. Stick with the lighter stuff and you won't be disappointed.

"], "author": "Michael T.", "review": "Once again, our good friends at NorCal made their usual 6:30am rounds, waking us up in the process (can't you bastards be a little more quiet on a holiday?), so while the wife was stuck working on this gloriously rainy San Francisco holiday, I figured it was a great time to catch up on, like, 8 extra hours of sleep. Of course, a couple of my clients had other ideas, and my CrackBerry got me out of bed for good about 8:30. So I figured I'd be a good hubby and meet the wife for lunch in the FiDi.\n\nWe chose Salt House for 3 reasons: First, a serious foodie friend of mine RAVED about the joint when it opened, Second, it's right around the corner from the wife's office, and Third, they were serving a price fixe lunch as part of the SF Dine About Town. To my delight, I was able to score an 11:45am reservation on Open Table around 9ish, and set out into the now sunny SF morning (seriously, is Mother Nature battling PMS or something?!?) to catch the Muni limo to head downtown.\n\nWe walked in around 11:50, and the place was empty. I guess that's par for the course on a holiday, as most of my mates were still up in Tahoe themselves for the long weekend. It did start to pick up around 12:30, but there were still plenty of free tables when we left around 1. To their credit, both our hostess and waiter went out of their way to tell the wife and I about the D.A.T. special, and our friendly waiter did not at all make us feel out of place (read: ghetto) for taking advantage of the deal like some places in town (I'm talking to you Ruth's Chris! Get over you're effin self!). Salt House kicks off every meal with fresh, crusty bread from the wonderful Acme Bread Co. in the Ferry Building with house-whipped butter, which for the carb-addicted like yours truly made a wonderful starter in and of itself. As part of the price fixe menu, I had the pork pozole, a hearty stew of braised pork shoulder with chickpeas, pickled carrots and onions, and jalapenos. The stew was absolutely phenomenal, with the succulent pork melting in your mouth as the chickpeas exploded with flavor with each and every bite. The charming gay couple next to us both ordered the same, and I overheard one of them mentioning that he detected the flavor of fresh saffron in the complex broth. I devoured the entire bowl, and even though the portion was more than generous for lunch, the pozole was so delicious I was left craving seconds. The wife had the Salt House burger, an expertly cooked patty of pure perfection topped with cheddar cheese and onion straws served on a fresh Acme Bread roll. The burger was so juicy, my wife literally had juices running down BOTH her arms! She said it was definitely one of the best burgers she's had in the FiDi, hands down. The burger is not served with fries, which I guess is all the better if you order the famous poutine as an app. It wasn't offered on the price fixe menu, and as we took it a little easy on the drinking yesterday, we decided to pass for now, but will definitely be back after a few happy hour pints to give the poutine a try.\n\nThe price fixe lunch was served with only 1 choice, the Meyer Lemon panna cotta, for dessert. I decided to pass as I'm not big on sweets in the middle of the day, but wifey really enjoyed the subtly sweet vanilla custard, which was topped with fragrant candied Meyer lemons and served in a pool of raspberry sauce. Salt House has a decent wine and beer list, with Trumer Pils, Anchor Steam, Dogfish Head IPA and Widmer Hefeweizen on tap. Our tab came out to $67 including drinks and tip, not too bad for a place that on a normal weekday is filled with power lunchers with expense accounts and the like. All told, the Salt House is a solid FiDi joint that is worth the little splurge.

This restaurant has been around now for several years and is quite often the place we go for business lunches.  The food is always very consistent here and I've never had a plate put in front of me that didn't taste fantastic!  There are several items that are always on the menu, the Crispy Shrimp and Green Bean Salad is amazing.  Other starters that will melt in your mouth are the Poutine (French Fried Potatoes topped with Gravy & Cheese) which is absolutely divine.  On the entre side, there is always a variety of selections including chicken, fish and maybe lamb.  Sometimes there are entr\u00e9es that include items with duck & beef.  The Salt House Burger is always on the entre menu and is really good too.  I have had the Petrali Sole and Halibut dishes several times along with beef short ribs when it is on the menu.  The blend of flavors is insanely tasty and keeps me going back.  They can accommodate small parties as well as ours which was a party of 10.  Prices are what you would expect for a restaurant of this caliber and you won't walk away hungry.  On the down side, it can get crowded with tables placed pretty close together.
