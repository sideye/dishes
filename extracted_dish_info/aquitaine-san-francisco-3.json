It was about 7:30pm and all the restaurants in Belden Alley were either packed or looked uninviting. So Aquitane looked about as good as anything in the neighborhood. And best of all, it was open and not too crowded.\n\nOur famished group of 5 was immediately seated at a nice round table (which is perfect for everyone to see and chat with one another). So everything was off to a promising start! But then our server greeted us, and then that's when things started to go down hill. \nBefore we could even look at our menu, he immediately tried to sell us on a bottle of wine. When my co-worker mentioned that she was interested in drinking a red, he replied \"So a bottle then? How many bottles for the table?\" Whoa whoa whoa - slow down there, Speed Racer. No one said anything about bottles. I decided to order a glass of bubbles. Once again, the server asked if I'd like to order a bottle. In fact, it wasn't so much asking as it was automatically assuming. We then all put in our food orders. We were a very simple bunch this night. 4 burgers, an order of frites, and a side of polenta. The waiter didn't really hide his disappointment with our simple order. It was like you could see him calculating in his head how little money he was going to make off our table. When we all finished placing our orders, the guy then said \"So shall I start you off with the cheese platter?\" Again, not really asking, but inferring that this what we should be doing. We politely declined. \"Ok, then how about an order or two of Deviled Eggs?\"\n\nI finally had enough of the hard sell and spoke up. \"Excuse me, could you please just accept our order and stop up-selling us? We just want our burgers and wine. That's it.\"\n\nThe server seemed to get the hint and went off to the kitchen. 20 minutes later, we got our food. It was fine. I've definitely had better hamburgers. There was nothing exciting going on with this burger to warrant the $16 price. Furthermore, the hamburger bun was over-toasted (to the point where it was just crunchy bread). And the fries that accompanied the dish were quite limp. They could've used a few more minutes in the fryer. Though I did enjoy the dipping sauce that came with them.\n\nAll in all, this was a decent meal... but nothing to write home about. And the pushy waiter really tarnished the enjoyment of our dining experience. We came here for dinner, and not to buy a time-share.

This was after much dithering!  We all ended up tasting all the dishes so I can report my thoughts:\n\n1.  Lamb - totally delicious!  Comes with a polenta with ratatouille that is to die for, and the sauce too.\n\n2.  Ditto for the steak.  The green peppercorn sauce was very \"Peppery.\"  The steak was tender and I ate all the potatoes (well, my brother is supposedly low carb, right?)\n\n3.  Divers scallops - mixed feelings.  My Mom did not really like hers, but she did eat one whole \"shell\" and all 3 scallops.  They come in three large shells that have the scallop on the end and the melon mix in the shell.  It is kind of like a salad.  The whole thing is served on kelp which some of us tried nibbling on.  I liked mine a lot (scallop dish, not the kelp).  Maybe Mom was just stuffed on the mussels . . . .?\n\n4.  Duck confit - two pieces of duck with a delicious sauce and large beans and mushrooms.  I would order this one next time.

The absolutely inedible kind of black.  Shame on the cook for serving burnt bread. Unacceptable! How hard is it to toast another piece? The restaurant had only three others at the bar, none of which were eating food. Its not like he was slammed and forgot my bread. I went back. I work in a kitchen myself so I know all too well the ins and outs of a lazy day-shift cook. I waltzed to the end of the bar which is by the kitchen and handed the cook my to-go box with the burnt bread showing.\n\n \"Do you always serve burnt bread?\" I said to him. \nHe responded with, \"Oh shit, I didn't see that! Sorry!\" \n\nOf course you didn't, you just put mayo on that side with your EYES CLOSED.\n\nI sat at the bar and the waitress noticed I was back. I told her I was served burnt bread and that it was all good because the cook was re-making it. She kindly offered me a drink on the house. \n\nAll in all, that burnt bread cost them stars but the replacement and drink comp showed good customer service. I was still disappointed that the cook even allowed that to happen but hopefully I was the last person he served burnt bread because he did not get away with it this time. The sandwich is delicious but very rich. \n\nI peeped their menu and it looks like they have tons of amazing french food. I will be back to give them a chance to make those stars back!

"], "author": "Christopher H.", "review": "If you are in a hurry or don't like to read I will sum it up for you - Aquitaine is fantastic, go there!\n\nI had the good fortune to live almost five years in Europe, some of that time living in Paris and traveling throughout France. From this experience I developed an appreciation of French food culture. The French have a fundamental understanding that most of us Americans lack - good food comes from good materials and expert preparation. This is not fast, not easy, and not cheap.  When you consider all the costs and challenges of going into the restaurant business it is remarkable that anyone takes the plunge; especially to bring high quality expertly prepared food to a sometimes unappreciative American audience. Fortunately for all of us Laurent Manrique and Andrew Fidelman have taken that risk and created a wonderful oasis of French cuisine at 175 Sutter Street in San Francisco.\n\nManrique comes from a rural town in the south of France near Toulouse. He is classically trained and a Michelin starred chef. His resume is extensive with projects that span both coasts of the USA. Manrique's partner at Aquitane is Andrew Fidelman, an American, born in Detroit, who became a wine connoisseur and sommelier. Together they form an impressive team.\n\nWhen we arrived at Aquitaine we entered a welcoming bistro style restaurant where the casually dressed diner feels comfortable. This is in keeping with the decor of French country restaurants that serve a local population. We immediately saw the impressive array of wines proudly displayed that gives the impression of having arrived in a great wine cellar. But just wait till you see what comes out of that kitchen. Unbeknownst to us, co-owner Andrew Fidelman would be our waiter.\n\nWe started with the Beet Salad, a sumptuous combination of beets, kale, pear, and walnuts, covered in a thin blanket of smoked duck. For the main course we ordered the Aquitaine signature dish - Braised Lamb Shanks for 2. The meat was so flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender with an accompanying broth that is its own soup course. Ask for bread. You don't want the broth to go to waste. Andrew Fidelman suggested the Caramelized Eggplant with mint that is a perfect pairing to the lamb. This is French country comfort food at its absolute best. Fidelman selected for us a moderately priced French wine that was a very nice accompaniment to the meal.\n\nEverything was superbly prepared and the portions very ample which unfortunately gave us no room to enjoy the sumptuous selection of deserts. But we didn't mind because we now have a great excuse to go back.\n\nThe bill came to $113 for the two of us, but considering the quality and authenticity of the French cooking is well worth it. Far cheaper than a trip to France, and you still get the real thing!\n\nAnd if you ever happen to be in Paris, visit Le Grappillon restaurant at 32 Rue Tiquetonne in the 3rd arrondissement. That is my other most favorite place in the world for French comfort food.\n\nBut since I won't be going to Paris anytime soon, the Aquitaine absolutely fills my need for that essential taste of France.
