This earns them points in my book, because some Chinese restaurants stop seating a half hour BEFORE the posted closing time, which I find infuriating. \n\nThey brought out a couple \"banchan\" like items to the table when I was seated.

The duck is smoky, almost ham-like, and it is bone-in, so there is a lot of picking around involved in the eating. If you enjoy La Zi Ji, then this is up your alley. In this case, the duck isn't breaded, but it is stir-fried in the wok with fresh green and dried red chilies, a well as ginger and garlic. It's wonderfully spicy and savory.

I also ordered Fish Filets In Hot Chili Oil...very oily but still good.....fried fillets in a very spicy sauce. Finally I went out on a limb and tried the  Sauteed Lily Bulbs & Celery & Gingko Nuts, Cashew Nuts, & Macadamia Nuts ....yes only a vegan would love this. I will pass next time.\n\nI like that this restaurant offers unique items: frogs legs, kidneys, trype, Chinese Yam Deep Fired Rolls  anyone???\n\nIf you are a vegetarian....I see you out there....they have an awesome assortment of vegetarian selections.\n\nPrices are very good. \n\nI recommend you come when they are not crazy busy because service will get slow and parking is hell fri sat night.\n\nIf you have delicate stomachs...ask for the pepcid or pepto shot before hand...word up!!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-10-29"}, {"excerpts": ["When she mentioned the Spicy Tea Smoked Duck, and I knew I had to try it.

I could imagine this restaurant earning 5 stars in the future after I've sampled more of the menu. \n\nI arrived at 10:06 PM after Outside Lands, and I expected them to be closed already, since 10 PM is the posted closing time. However, they seated me, and then another couple groups after me up until about 10:30, so I suppose the real closing time depends on demand and how the staff is feeling on an individual night. This earns them points in my book, because some Chinese restaurants stop seating a half hour BEFORE the posted closing time, which I find infuriating. \n\nThey brought out a couple \"banchan\" like items to the table when I was seated. I believe they were seaweed and a mildly pickled cabbage. This isn't typical at Chinese restaurants, so it was a welcome gift. There is also complimentary tea, as you'd expect. \n\nI asked for recommendations of the spicy, Sichuan specialties of the chef, and the server ticked off some of my classic favorites, such as Szechuan Style Spicy Chicken (La Zi Ji, but boneless), Sliced Beef in Hot Chili Oil (Shui Zhu Niu Rou), and Fish Fillets in Hot Chili Oil (Shui Zhu Yu). \n\nWhen she mentioned the Spicy Tea Smoked Duck, and I knew I had to try it. The duck is smoky, almost ham-like, and it is bone-in, so there is a lot of picking around involved in the eating. If you enjoy La Zi Ji, then this is up your alley. In this case, the duck isn't breaded, but it is stir-fried in the wok with fresh green and dried red chilies, a well as ginger and garlic. It's wonderfully spicy and savory. My only complaint is that the duck was tougher than expected--I don't know whether it is always this way, or if my dish suffered because I ordered it at the end of the night. Only ordering it again, earlier in the day, will tell. \n\nI had expected to also order Sichuan wontons in chili oil (Hong You Chao Shou, literally Red Oil Folded Hands, here called Wonton Soup in Hot and Spicy Sauce), but then I saw Xiao Long Bao (here called Shanghai Style Steam Bun) on the menu. If you know me at all, you know I'm obsessed with XLB, so I had to try them here, even though this is a Sichuanese restaurant, not Shanghainese. The XLB were average, but not outstanding. Most critically they were short on the rich, unctuous, umami flavor that life-changing XLB possess. Next time, I'll try the Hong You Chao Shou instead, which I also love. \n\nService was attentive, even though the staff were eating their customary end-of-the-night meal. \n\nPrices are great, a little less than other Sichuan spots like Z&Y in Chinatown and Sichuan Fusion in Richmond. \n\nNext, I need to visit Sichuan Fortune House in Pleasant Hill, and then I can finally determine which \"Sichuan [living establishment]\" restaurant reigns supreme in my spice-lusting heart (and tummy).", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-11"}], "chefs special fried chicken": [], "orange peel chicken": [], "orange peel beef": [], "roast duck in the lotus leaf": [], "beef in red chili sauce": [], "salt and pepper beef short ribs": [], "spicy garlic beef short ribs": [], "beef short ribs in black pepper sauce": [], "lamb in cumin sauce": [{"excerpts": ["Lamb in Cumin Sauce (Mild)\n\n", "I really enjoyed both the black mushroom and tender greens and the lamb in cumin sauce.

There aren't too many spicy Chinese restaurants in the city overall, so we're glad to have a delicious option when we're craving spicy Chinese food. \n\nTheir boiling fish hot pot is really popular, and for good reason. For people who aren't familiar with Chinese food, they bring it out on a small, personalized burner that keeps the dish hot while you're eating it.
