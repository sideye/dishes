The chi fan -chinese dough nut with preserved vegetables and a dried pork product wrapped with rice,  is what I like about this place.  I'm not sure of any other joints that serve this product, except for the late and great \"Star Lunch\" which shut down.  There are also a handful of dishes that stand out. The apps and most of their dumplings are tasty, especially the scallion pancakes.  The pancakes were nice and chewy, with that eggy fried dough crisp on the outside.  \n\nMost of the noodle dishes were good, up to par with the very best of other noodle shops, but on the oily side.  Most of the stuff was good at best, and there wasn't anything exceptional.\n\nService lacks here, and prices you pay will dent your wallet.  This is overly priced Chinese food.  With the price you pay, you'd expect better service and bigger portions of food.  It's sad that you pay 7 bucks for 4 small chicken wings.  The accompanying dip is good, but hey, its just 4 dinky wings.  On top of that, the chicken isn't like organic or steroid free.  So what justifies the high price dishes? The service isn't high-end or professional, and the seating experience isn't armed tablecloth.   You can get the same quality tasting food in just about 3 other handfuls Chinese restaurants in the city. The Potsticker in Chinatown is one to name.\n\nI know, Taiwanese, and Pekingese dishes are different.  But really, its all identical dishes but finished differently with each Chef's style and touch.  I know the $80 dollar dinner -spent here between two people, could've done more good at another Chinese restaurant with better experiences.  If you plan to pay, I don't mind coming here, otherwise, money is well spent somewhere else.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-03-26"}], "deep fried squid": [{"excerpts": ["So we got that, chive pocket, sticky rice with pork, crepe with oyster, and deep fried squid.\n\n"], "author": "Ari C.", "review": "If there's one thing I'm good at, it is being a third wheel. I went to the Yelp Prom (http://www.yelp.com/events/oakland-enchantment-by-the-sea-prom-to-benefit-hands-on-bay-area) with Kerrie and her 1HMF and I was being a complete darling by taking lots of pictures of them together, urging them to dance, and most importantly, leaving them alone when they wanted to make out. I'm good at picking out cues they gave out when they're trying to tell me to get lost.\n\nI'm kidding. They're nice people. 1HMF was so nice that when we went to Taste of Formosa for dinner before the prom, he paid for everything.\n\nTaste of Formosa is a Taiwanese restaurant that's apparently a rarity in SF. I don't know if it's authentic or not because I've only been to Taiwan once and the last Taiwanese restaurant I went to was in Singapore.\n\nSo we just picked some snack items that sounded good. 1HMF recommended the green onion pancake because according to him, Ed to the M swears by it. And who am I to question the great Ed to the M, the ultimate chink? So we got that, chive pocket, sticky rice with pork, crepe with oyster, and deep fried squid.\n\nThe green onion pancake was pretty good. Not something I'd swear by though *ducks rocks thrown by Ed's fans*. The crepe was a little weird. It looked like egg foo yung and tasted like gluten. I think I like the sticky rice and the calamari the best. The chive pocket was okay. I think it gave me bad breath for the rest of the night. Those of you who talked to me at the prom, I'm sorry if my breath offended you.\n\nFive snack plates were actually pretty fulfilling. No need to get full plates, and you get to taste a variety of dishes for reasonable price. I think the bill came to about $30 for everything. Service was fine, a little slow in the beginning, but nothing majorly irritating. \n\nOverall, that dinner was a nice opening for the prom night. Thanks, Kerrie and 1HMF, you guys are awesome.
