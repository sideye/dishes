We went all out -- Onion Soup Gratinee and Baked Cambozola for appetizers, and Grilled Flat Iron Steak and Moules Louisette for our entrees.\n\nONION SOUP:\nProbably the best onion soup I have ever had. It's rich with flavor and comes topped with a melty cheesy mess that you can just dig into with your spoon. Too much soup for you? Dip a bit of the complimentary bread in, and you have yourself a whole new way of enjoying this appetizer.\n\nBAKED CAMBOZOLA:\nAt the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the Baked Cambozola as well. He said it was similar to bleu cheese, which we were a bit wary of because we're both not the biggest fans of bleu cheese. But out came something that we didn't expect -- a small bubbling pot of melted cambozola with four toast points and a head of roasted garlic. Our waiter was even kind enough to squeeze the roasted garlic out for us to enjoy so that we wouldn't get our hands messy. This dish was absolutely divine. Rich and creamy but not overpowering at all. Take a toast point, pile on the cambozola and a bit of the roasted garlic, and you will be sooo happy.\n\nGRILLED FLAT IRON STEAK:\nA steak that literally melts in your mouth. We like our steak medium rare, and this steak came out just perfect. Tender, juicy, flavorful... I'm drooling a bit just thinking about it. The steak also comes with a massive side of fries.\n\nMOULES LOUISETTE:\nAfter eating mussels at Gamine, it made me wonder about how mussels reproduce, and whether or not they reproduce at a massive rate because Gamine serves these guys by the potful. And I mean pot. FULL. When I ordered the mussels, I didn't expect an entire pot of simmering steamed mussels to be presented to me. I wish I had taken a before and after picture so that you could see the graveyard of shells that once housed some juicy seafood. The Louisette broth was delicious, but I feel that one of the other mussel choices would have packed even more flavor. Next time, Gamine. Next time.\n\nIf we weren't so stuffed from these dishes, I'm pretty sure that we would have ordered their dessert, too. If you're in the mood for some good French food in a cute, rustic atmosphere, you can't miss Gamine.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["We were seated and treated very well, started with Onion Soup Gratinee ", "and yes I googled Gratinee ( soup in a round bowl) ", "wow ", "wow wow.

"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Gamine is no Chez Maman....\n\nAfter having dined at Chez Maman (Potrero Hill) last year, I had high hopes for Gamine especially when they use to be both owned by Maktub Group (Chez Papa, the original Potrero Maman et al.). Here's the link to my Chez Maman review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-maman-san-francisco#hrid:9yXW3HWWyFTcCCArt-6MmQ However, there was a change of ownership in 2008. Although Gamine and Chez Maman still share similar menu with almost as equally delicious food, Gamine loses stars for their lackluster and cold service. \n\nOn Thursday, 7.7.11, my friends and I (party of 7) came to Gamine for dinner at 6 PM. I was fortunate to have made reservations (minimum party of 6 needed) the day prior. We had a last minute change in party size and they were nice enough to accommodate my request. \n\nF O OD\n*ONION SOUP GRATINEE ($7.50) - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=TbPvgxwYBrRu13JP-W_-Vw\nThe onion soup was deliciously hearty with rich, complex stewed onion flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. It was generously crowed with bubbling, oooey gooey swiss cheese which stretched and pulled as I took a spoonful of soup.\n\n*BAKED CAMBOZOLA w/ Roasted Garlic & Toast Points ($9.50) - 5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=XVPPnt7sll66Kh01lUnDMw\nThe crunchy toast points were the perfect canvas for the buttery sweet roasted garlic and decadently rich, melted cambozola which was ultra-creamy with a mild pungency. Each bite was sinfully good and let me wanting more!\n\nBEEF TARTARE (Entr\u00e9e Size - $17) - 3 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=bh-D8gSVKLRpyQNwpdVYQg\nThough the tartare was soft and tender, it was lacking in flavor (i.e. tang). I think more Worcestershire sauce would have been benefited the tartare. \n\nBASIC BURGER w/ Brie, Bacon & an Egg ($12 + $1.50/topping) - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=kLmy1UufvB5sA9tG1puA9g\nThough a complete heart attack on the platter, I wanted to get the whole \"French\" burger experience so I decided to make my Basic Burger \"French Style\" by adding Brie, Bacon and an Egg. \n\nThe French roll was perfectly toasted creating a sog barrier which held the beef patty and all the accoutrements together well. Cooked medium rare as requested, the patty was tender, moist, and juicy. The heat from the patty gently melted the creamy and milky brie. The bacon was crisp with a nice porky smokiness. The egg, however, was overcooked and the yolk didn't ooze out as I expected. Completing the heart attack on the platter was the gentle smearing of garlic aioli which added a layer of creamy garlicky richness.\n\nI opted for the salad instead of the fries, though I regret not getting the fries now. The salad was just a mixture of baby lettuces tossed in balsamic vinaigrette which was nothing special. \n\nS E R V I C E\nBeing formerly linked to Chez Maman and after having a pleasant experience over the phone while making/changing my reservations, I expected the service to be similarly as good. However, our waiter had no personality and was cold in his interactions with us. This was a far cry from the charming experience we had while at Chez Maman.\n\nOur appetizers came out within 10 minutes of ordering, but there was a lag when it came to our entrees. It took over 45 minutes to get our entrees after finishing our appetizers. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nRustic and very intimate, Gamine is great for a small casual dinner (party of 2-4). The main dining room is small and can accommodate about 20 people. We were offered the private dining room upstairs for our group which I gladly accepted thinking we would have more room. But after being sat in the private room, I wish we would have sat at the main dining room instead.\n\nThe private dining room was small, stuffy, and claustrophobic. The ceiling was low but was made even lower from the burgundy curtain draping. There were fridges in back of one of the curtains which blew out hot air causing the room to be very humid and stuffy. We had to open one of the back doors and keep it ajar just to let in some ventilation. \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking which was easily found before 6 PM, however, I know parking in the area can be difficult on the weekends.\n \nI initially was going to give Gamine 4 Stars but after pondering over it for several days, why reward a restaurant with 4 Stars with service that falls flat.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-07-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Onion Soup Gratinee & he got the Moules Mariniere.

Never have I seen a restaurant owner so invested in making his guests feel comfortable. Never. Not once. In my entire life. When you see Stefan interacting with his customers, it's as if he's known them for years.

It really is a perfect little restaurant, so out of lack of very many other words, allow yourselves to forgive my constant repetition of the word perfect in this review. The restaurant and the food are rustic and simple, but that does not take away from the boldness and perfect blending of flavors. I've never been to France, but the ambiance of Gamine is right out of a Food Network Show that's portraying the South of France. \n\nAll credit for us choosing this restaurant has to go to Yelp and it's reviewers. It was a cold, rainy day and we came running into Gamine, for a rather late for lunch around 1:30, and every table except 2 were occupied. We were seated almost immediately, there was 1 waiter for the whole restaurant. Granted the restaurant wasn't big at all, there must have been about about 8 or 10 tables altogether. \n\nI ordered a glass of wine, which my husband and I shared because we still had a whole day of sight-seeing left to do. For appetizers we ordered the Beef Tartar, which was excellent. It came with a little raw quail's egg on top, which I did not really fancy as I don't like runny yokes. But the beef itself, was perfectly seasoned and some of the best I've ever eaten. \n\nFor lunch I ordered the Roasted Chicken and my husband ordered the Grilled Pork Chop. Both dishes were divine! I mean absolutely outstanding. What a great way to kick off a vacation. Even the breast of the chicken was soft and juicy, and the whole dish was full of flavor. It didn't taste like a boiled chicken with sauce poured on top. The lemon did not overpower the chicken or the thyme in the jus at all, and the potatoes were perfectly roasted too, soft inside and crispy outside with just the right amount of salt. \n\nMy husband's pork chops were just as good. The meat was moist, flavorful and tender (something a lot of restaurants can't do right). The apple cider mustard sauce was impeccably balanced. The mustard wasn't overwhelming, the cider gave the whole dish a little zing and I have yet to ever eat a Brussels Sprout that I didn't like, so I don't really have much to say about them. \n\nThe portions were were pretty substantial, and we were both too stuffed to order dessert, unfortunately. The only thing that struck me as overreaching at Gamine was our waiter, I'm not sure if he really did have a French accent or if it was a put on, but it seemed he was trying really hard with it, and kept bowing to us whenever he said 'merci'. Again, I don't know if that is actually the culture in France or not, (please forgive me if and ignore all this if it is) but in what was such a perfect and simple setting, with the simplicity of flavor in each dish, the waiter seemed a little out of place.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-03-15"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorite is the roasted chicken - I always get it.

We went all out -- Onion Soup Gratinee and Baked Cambozola for appetizers, and Grilled Flat Iron Steak and Moules Louisette for our entrees.\n\nONION SOUP:\nProbably the best onion soup I have ever had. It's rich with flavor and comes topped with a melty cheesy mess that you can just dig into with your spoon. Too much soup for you? Dip a bit of the complimentary bread in, and you have yourself a whole new way of enjoying this appetizer.\n\nBAKED CAMBOZOLA:\nAt the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the Baked Cambozola as well. He said it was similar to bleu cheese, which we were a bit wary of because we're both not the biggest fans of bleu cheese. But out came something that we didn't expect -- a small bubbling pot of melted cambozola with four toast points and a head of roasted garlic. Our waiter was even kind enough to squeeze the roasted garlic out for us to enjoy so that we wouldn't get our hands messy. This dish was absolutely divine. Rich and creamy but not overpowering at all. Take a toast point, pile on the cambozola and a bit of the roasted garlic, and you will be sooo happy.\n\nGRILLED FLAT IRON STEAK:\nA steak that literally melts in your mouth. We like our steak medium rare, and this steak came out just perfect. Tender, juicy, flavorful... I'm drooling a bit just thinking about it. The steak also comes with a massive side of fries.\n\nMOULES LOUISETTE:\nAfter eating mussels at Gamine, it made me wonder about how mussels reproduce, and whether or not they reproduce at a massive rate because Gamine serves these guys by the potful. And I mean pot. FULL. When I ordered the mussels, I didn't expect an entire pot of simmering steamed mussels to be presented to me. I wish I had taken a before and after picture so that you could see the graveyard of shells that once housed some juicy seafood. The Louisette broth was delicious, but I feel that one of the other mussel choices would have packed even more flavor. Next time, Gamine.

Our friend replied affirmatively and was rewarded with free beer for the rest of the night. Our Oakland A's cap friend said he'd shave his full beard into a mustache on the spot for the same perk.

If our friend came back the next day with his beard shaved off, Stephen would donate $1000 from the restaurant to cancer research. After Stephen left the table, we decided we could wait no further. We dashed to the liquor store across the street, bought a 99 cent razor, and got to work in the restaurant's restroom with nothing more than hot water and hand soap. After the task was completed, Stephen was duly impressed, taking pictures and informing everyone that walked by of his deal. His friend had recently lost someone to cancer and he said he'd uphold his promise. We certainly hope he did. To top off the meal, we received a plate of creme brulee and a banana/nutella crepe on the house.

Despite this, the salmon flavor still managed to make itself known.\n\n(note: I am of the belief that dill is a spice that should be used sparingly; use more than just a bit, and it will drown out all the other flavors of the dish. But that's just me, right?)\n\nWhen I ordered the steak, the waitress asked how I wanted it cooked. I was about to say \"medium well\" when she suggested medium rare. Huh. Well, OK, medium rare it is. The steak actually came closer to rare than to medium rare, but I figured it was close enough. The meat had a good balance of seasoning, and was very flavorful and tender to boot. I think that vegetables or roasted potatoes would have been a better pairing than shoestring french fries. But of course that didn't stop me from scarfing them down anyway.\n\nCreme brulee for dessert; also a very tasty dish. Even had little traces of vanilla bean visible in it. I had Black Muscat, which was excellent: Viscous, the right amount of sweetness, and very jammy. It's how dessert wine should be made.\n\nThe service was very good, though we actually stood in the restaurant for a couple of minutes browsing the menu before we were noticed. We arrived before the place became crowded, and I think the waitstaff was still preparing for the dinner rush to start. I giggled each time the waitress said \"merci\" even though she was no more French than I am.\n\nThe lighting in the place is well-balanced, with a tea candle on each table supplemented by very soft overhead lighting. You can read the menu and see your food without feeling like you're in a museum. The climate control could use a bit of a boost, what with the front door being used as the primary cooling mechanism.

It is an intimate, cozy neighborhood French bistro with a small number of tables. We were seated promptly at a two-top and immediately knew what we were going to order. I had the Moules Catalane, containing white wine, Merguez sausage, tomatoes, and harissa ($16). She had the Moules Mariniere containing white wine, parsley, and lots of garlic ($15). We also added the french fries with aioli ($5) to complete our Parisian-esque adventure. \n\nOur overflowing small cauldrons of hot, steaming mussels were presented before us. The Moules Catalane had a jolt of spiciness from the harissa and Merguez. The mussels themselves were juicy and absorbed all of the bold flavors of the broth.

I remember seeing positive reviews of Gamines on YELP! and also hearing great reviews from a buddy of mine and his wife that go here regularly, so we decided to give it a shot. \n\nOur experience was bliss. The service was exceptional! The restaurant manager greeted us, our server walked us through the menu with energy and friendliness. \n\nWe tried out the french onion soup and our tastebuds were not disappointed! Then I went with their burger, hearing such great things about it. I dare say you may not find a better gourmet burger in town. And the skinny french fries with aioli were addictive!

Good ambience! \n\nSECOND EXPERIENCE: \nStill pumped about this little place, we decided to take my brother and sis-in-law here (it was her birthday). The manager again greeted us, and without a reservation on a busy Friday night, he was able to accommodate us inside. It was a late dinner (8pm) and everyone was really hungry. We also had our adorable 3-year nephew with us, who is pretty well-behaved for settings such as this one. The young guy who served us turned out experience around: condescending and rude. I don't know if the kid bothered him, the fact that no one wanted drinks, or if it was just a long night for him, but I was slightly embarrassed at how the interaction was going with he and my family. When asked questions, he was short. The birthday girl, when ordering the NY Strip Steak, asked a question that is a \"no no\" in culinary practice, she asked if she could get her steak well done. Now, my sis-in-law is 6 months pregnant, and is very careful about it. I've also heard this question handled very well in the past \"I'm sorry, our chef can serve it medium, and if it needs to be cooked further, we can accomodate.\" Something usually along these lines. We got, instead, something just short of an eye roll and an exclaimed reply with brows furrowed: \"Well done?????\" My sis-in-law turned red and everyone was uncomfortable. Then my brother ordered the burger for his son and asked if they could cut it in half when it was served. The reply? \"You have a knife, you could just as easy do it yourself!\" I was appalled. Cut the dang steak, dude!!! We are your patron, not someone inconveniencing you. I was embarrassed. After talking the place up, my brother and sis-in-law were not having a good time. \n\nIn fairness, the food was great that night. Everyone was pleased. The service just put a damper on the evening and had us rushing to get out of there. I would have shared with the manager, but doing so in front of the server seemed to be too much confrontation for the moment. The manager did check on us and ask how our experience was, to his credit. \n\n(Our poor b-day girl compounded her frustrating evening by walking into the men's restroom!

We were so happy to know that in one hour we would be sitting in this little romantic spot where greatness comes from. Must have been some word of mouth here cause it was so much busier this time. The owner was so kind and made sure to give us some wine while we waited and crack some jokes and kept checking on us. Finally, we sit. we had the same order as last time, except instead of the pork I got a veggie burger . Best veggie burger ever.

Well, it is if you're in Paris, but not if you're in San Francisco.  \n\nWhat Gamine manages to do is hold true to its roots.  It's French, so the service has attitude, the experience is meant to take time, and the food needs to be mopped up with a baguette.  If you're expecting fast service with \"the customer is always right\" attitude, then you've come to the wrong place.  If, however, you know better than to expect your lunch or dinner to take a minimum of 2 hours, then Sweet Jesus, you've found a piece of Paris in San Francisco.  \n\nHow the hell did it find its way there?  Excellent question.  It has had predecessors that have done well, but Gamine branches out.  It has not tried to cater to San Francisco, in fact, it has practically thumbed its nose at the city.  It has flair, attitude, and real Frenchmen working the scene (for better or for worse).  \n\nThe menu is French bistro fare at its finest.  There's an assortment of appetizers worth experiencing, including the escargot, which are cooked in a stick of butter and are the tenderest, most delectable morsels of snail-y goodness that you're likely to find.  If you've been waiting to experience this dish because you haven't had the stomach for it, this is the place to suck it up and give it a go.  You won't be disappointed.  The warm fris\u00e9e and duck confit salad was excellent, and the shredded duck meat was cooked perfectly - moist and tender - while the fresh cooked egg on top was spot on what you'd hope for from this dish.   The calamari were acceptable, and cooked perfectly in terms of consistency, but they were on the greasy side and mostly something to whet our appetites.  \n\nFor main courses, the pork chop was good - recommended by our waiter - and while I agree that it's preparation did allow for a full experience of fresh, juicy pork, and the apple cider mustard sauce was an excellent complement, I still was not sold on the brussel sprouts .  They needed to be cooked with some of the pork juices, in my opinion, and they weren't enough of a side to stand up to the pork chop by themselves.  The mussels were very good, but I've had better.

The frites were excellent, and were we not stuffed by the end of the meal, we would have ordered another plate to dump into and soak up our mussel broth - THAT'S the way to eat mussels.  Had we more diners, I would have insisted on trying one of their assortment of burgers.  They offer a variety, and from the looks of other patrons' plates and faces, these were delectable - just the right size, weight, assortment of toppings and (according to our waiter) freshness, as they don't even have a freezer on the premises.\n\nWe ate lunch at one of the three tables outside and had the pleasure of dining leisurely for two hours.  The inside, were it filled to capacity, would likely have been boisterous and cramped, but that's what an authentic French bistro SHOULD be, damn it.

Our friend replied affirmatively and was rewarded with free beer for the rest of the night. Our Oakland A's cap friend said he'd shave his full beard into a mustache on the spot for the same perk.

We dashed to the liquor store across the street, bought a 99 cent razor, and got to work in the restaurant's restroom with nothing more than hot water and hand soap.

"], "author": "Tim B.", "review": "Went here with a friend some time back.\n\nHe had the onion soup and the penne with salmon cream sauce. I went for the flat iron steak.\n\nThe soup was unremarkable. Onions, bread, cheese: all there. Nothing wrong with it; just not particularly fantastic. The penne was heavily seasoned with dill. Despite this, the salmon flavor still managed to make itself known.\n\n(note: I am of the belief that dill is a spice that should be used sparingly; use more than just a bit, and it will drown out all the other flavors of the dish. But that's just me, right?)\n\nWhen I ordered the steak, the waitress asked how I wanted it cooked. I was about to say \"medium well\" when she suggested medium rare. Huh. Well, OK, medium rare it is. The steak actually came closer to rare than to medium rare, but I figured it was close enough. The meat had a good balance of seasoning, and was very flavorful and tender to boot. I think that vegetables or roasted potatoes would have been a better pairing than shoestring french fries. But of course that didn't stop me from scarfing them down anyway.\n\nCreme brulee for dessert; also a very tasty dish. Even had little traces of vanilla bean visible in it. I had Black Muscat, which was excellent: Viscous, the right amount of sweetness, and very jammy. It's how dessert wine should be made.\n\nThe service was very good, though we actually stood in the restaurant for a couple of minutes browsing the menu before we were noticed. We arrived before the place became crowded, and I think the waitstaff was still preparing for the dinner rush to start. I giggled each time the waitress said \"merci\" even though she was no more French than I am.\n\nThe lighting in the place is well-balanced, with a tea candle on each table supplemented by very soft overhead lighting. You can read the menu and see your food without feeling like you're in a museum. The climate control could use a bit of a boost, what with the front door being used as the primary cooling mechanism. The place went from very warm to very cool several times, as the door was propped open and shut.\n\nFor dinner in the city, the prices are very reasonable. There were 3 waiters working in a place that could have been served by just one or two (which is a good thing). The abundance of waitstaff results in them checking on you frequently. Getting their attention is also very easy.\n\nNote: if you are going here with more than 3 people, I strongly advise you make a reservation. The place is very small (seating for ~25 people max) and once it gets busy, a party of 4+ could end up waiting for a long time.\n\nSo bottom line:\n\nFood - very good\nValue - excellent\nService - very good\nAmbiance - very good\n\n4.2 stars.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-08-07"}, {"excerpts": ["The creme brulee was really good too!

It's a french place, but there was a decorative buddha on the wall, which had a pretty calming effect-- made me feel at home, at ease.  I had to do a double take because I thought maybe the wine was making me hallucinate a bit.\n\nI'm not sure if they provide bottle service here, but I would look into it next time.  You don't want to be paying 40/bottle during this recession, although I guess it's not that overpriced comparatively.  \n\nBeing the carb queen that I am, the potato gratin was delicious, and I would definitely order it again.
