The noodles are traditionally freshly pulled thick noodles made in house. The name of the noodles come from the \"dan\" merchants use to peddle the noodles in China. Also, \"dan\" means \"bouncy\" or \"springy\" in Chinese, which perfectly describes the process of how the dan dan mien is made, as well as the texture of the noodles when eaten. But, enough about the history of dan dan mien.\n\nOn my most recent visit, we ordered the Xiao Lin Dumplings and Hot and Sour Soup to start off. Xiao Lin Dumplings are fickle creatures. The chef made them amazingly juicy and tender with the right amount of broth in each morsel. Dipped in red vinegar, it makes you crave for another. The hot and sour soup was standard, nothing special about it. I will give credit because it's not overly sour, which is always a good thing.\n\nOur main course is the dan dan mien. I ordered a garlic peanut sauce one because the classic has always been my favorite since I was a child. My friends ordered the spicy flavored one. We ended up eating the noodles family style, split into smaller bowls. Why? Because the portions of these dan dan mien are HUGE. One bowl can serve 2-3 people. But it's not just quantity, it's also quality also.\n\nThe garlic peanut version had a milder taste, the tones of peanut and garlic meld together with the creamy noodles, it's very rich and filling. The spicy variety is also very buttery, but has a spicy kick to it. It's not Sirarcha-worshiper spicy, just enough to go with the rich creamy texture of dan dan mien.\n\nService here is slow because there's only two waiters, the owner and a hired employee. Atmosphere is very casual and the decor is drab, but that's because they spend their resources on making good food. They tend to the taste buds, not the eyes.\n\nBottom line: Delicious dan dan mien.

There aren't many places where you can see that and their donuts are always fresh.  \n\nFor brunch we usually get soy milk (salted or sweet, $1.25).  It's served hot in a bowl.  Delicious.  My father says their donuts aren't as airy and light inside as they should be but I think he's comparing it to what he had in Taiwan.  \n\nTheir shredded white turnip cakes (4 per order) were huge, the size of a red bean bun and stuffed with turnip, ground pork and mushrooms.  The shell was thin and flaky on top and thicker on the bottom.  These were really good.  \n\nThe hot boiled dumplings had a tasty pork filling but there wasn't enough filling and there was too much dough.  Also the soy sauce it was tossed in made the dumplings too salty.  I noticed you can ask for low salt - we should remember to do that though I'd rather get other dumplings (these were like won tons) with less skin.  The Shanghai thick noodle was disappointing - oily and bland.  \n\nThey are trying - they will make dishes w/o msg, with less salt or hot & spicy upon request and they even have brown rice now.

Steamed dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=bVTHJlHoJ4YQiirRjgLw9w) - Better known as Xiao Lung Baos, they are larger than most and like 1., skin on thick side.\n\n4.

Fried well but no distinct flavor.\n\n5.  Fried squid (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=2KeA1m_3rWgKrf9FNTJKdA) - Probably my least favorite as they could pass for pork rinds.\n\n6.  Wok-fried Shanghai thick noodles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=h9FnAuBagMh80C4CBXQsGw) - The noodles were extraordinarily thick almost udon like.  Flavors were very distinct as chef had a light hand on the soy sauce while stir frying.\n\n7.  Bean and meat sauce noodles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=agbAC1NtfEOYP3SPCl4Izw) - Probably my favorite as seasonings were spot in.  A little more veggies might make this a must-order.\n\n8.  Dry braised green beans (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Hard to do this wrong, they did a decent job in savoriness and not overcooking them.\n\n9.

We came at the perfect time and grabbed the last available table in the place.  The bicycle cops were working extra hard that night \n\n- Cold jellyfish.  I've never ordered this here before.  I was shocked to see that they serve the jellyfish over a huge bed of cucumbers.  I'm not a fan of cucumbers and it sucked that the jellyfish took on the cucumber taste.\n\n- Hot & Sour soup.  It was a bit bland.  I had to add more pepper to make it hotter.  I'm just glad they didn't over do it on the vinegar.\n\n- Salted mustard green bits & pork.  This dish I did like.  Was great with some white rice.\n\n- Black bean sauce noodles.  I like the noodles that they use.  The sauce is a different story.  It just tastes different than I remember it.  I used to like it.\n\nI wonder if they have a different chef i the kitchen now?  If Yelp was available back i the days, I would have rated it a 4.

We only ate half of it since it was so big.\n\nSpicy Wontons - The wontons themselves were really good, but it wasn't spicy at all. The skins were thicker than I'm used to, but it was al dente - the way I like it. The meat was super juicy too. The sauce was basically just soy sauce. I didn't see any chili flakes or chili oil in it.\n\nSzechuan Hot Sauce Noodles - These were sooo good! The noodles are the kind you usually see in northern Chinese noodle dishes. I don't think they were homemade, though. I really couldn't point out every ingredient in the sauce, but it was super tastey.
