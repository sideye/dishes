Their burrito had the perfect amount of ingredients and everything tasted fresh and was seasoned well.\n\nThe only disappointment was the churro. It was too crunchy for my liking and didn't seem very fresh. It almost seemed stale to me? Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Churros Mexicanos cart in Fruitvale... But El Corneta's churro relleno did not meet my expectations.\n\nI was also very happy with the service here. The two young ladies who helped me were very attentive even though they seemed swamped with orders. The lady who ordered before me was rude to them and almost ran out with MY burrito because she wouldn't listen to what they were saying. Some of y'all customers need to chill and be more respectful to workers. Thankfully, they were able to stop her from running away with my burrito. \n\nI have no idea why some people are saying this taqueria is cash only. They accept cards too!

"], "author": "Daniel L.", "review": "I've been on a quest to find a taqueria in the Mission that beats El Farolito. La Corneta has always piqued my interest with its clean and spacious ambiance decorated with red tiled floors and a colorful blend of red, orange, yellow, and other vibrant colors to bring a festive vibe. It's a bit smoky at the entrance where they broil and grill their meat to bring you an instantaneous aromatic introduction. This is also where you get to glance at the huge wall menu with a long food counter with all sorts of eye-popping meat, rice, beans and all the Mexican goodies you can imagine.\n\nI've been to here twice, once for dinner on a weeknight another on a festive weekend that had a celebratory mariachi band where the place was bursting with people from all walks of life. On my first visit my super vegetarian burrito ($5.25) came with complimentary chips, black beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I wasn't too impressed with their burrito as it was dry on the spots that were without guacamole. I thought it had too much fresh lettuce and the salsa was bland. It wasn't the most flavorful and the experience was over-dependent on the red and green salsa located at each table.\n\nMy second visit I ordered a chicken tamal and pork tamal with rice, black beans, lettuce, guacamole, and salsa ($7.75). The chicken tamal was dry and bland but the pork tamal was tasty with tender fat trimmings to keep me engaged the whole time. I thought the rice and beans were decent but the complimentary chips could be better warmed and salted. Salsa again could and should include chopped jalapeno to induce a spicy kick instead of letting it fell flat. My order of large melon aqua fresca ($2.50) was refreshing and a nice finisher. I did not receive my stack of tortillas even though it was clearly stated on the menu. \n\nOverall, I thought their prices were higher than others in the Mission while in exchange the food had very good portions but the flavor was not exciting enough to match its beautiful decor. I saw many Mexican customers ordering their carne asada so that might be a dish to look into for those interested. This place is spacious and has the room to support large groups and families. 3 stars for the overall experience.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["what I get here is a super vegetarian burrito.

I was officially worried.\nThat ain't no Taco Bell Quesadilla, friends.  Welcome to the world of giants.\n\nI finished half with some work, and even then, I was full for the remainder of the day.  The only reason I could finish half was because of the perfectly toasted flour tortilla, and the fresh, juicy fillings, with lots of fresh guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, etc. that was too good to pass up....  I suspect most girls will finish about 1/4 of  this quesadilla, so dining \"family-style\" might be wise....\n\nThe establishment is bright and pleasant, and they have some nice seating in one section of the restaurant for a near \"patio-dining\" effect.  During lunch, it was pretty crowded, and I suspect the same will hold true for dinner.  Location was a bit fishy, but I didn't feel my life was in danger at any point.  Staff was so-so, but nothing to complain about.\n\nOh, and they have two kinds of salsa, one is mild and the other is hot, with fresh bits of jalapeno.  Now, for me, this was no challenge, but if you can't handle spicy - - go for the first, or pick out the jalapeno bits.  I didn't try the mild version but I could just eat up spoonfuls of the second one all day long and be happy.  Combined bite by bite with my quesadilla, it was perfect.\n\nI glanced around and noticed almost everything is big here.  It's not \"fast food cheap\" either, as lunch for two with two super quesadillas and two drinks was *almost* $20 if I recall correctly.  But service is fast, and the food is tasty and fresh.  Speaking of drinks - we tried the \"horchata\", I think it was called, and it was quite complementary to our food.  It's like sugar water with a good dose of cinnamon, what I imagine a churro to taste like if blended with water?  Doesn't sound appetizing but it was actually quite good.\n\nA strong 3-stars for the food, and an additional 1 star simply for being almost OVERLY generous with sizing.  While this meant i could not finish my meal, it does mean a big guy with a hearty apetite would walk out of here very, very, very happy.  :-)\n\nFYI - according to their menu, there are four locations, 2 in SF, one in Burlingame, and one in Redwood City.

La Corneta has always piqued my interest with its clean and spacious ambiance decorated with red tiled floors and a colorful blend of red, orange, yellow, and other vibrant colors to bring a festive vibe. It's a bit smoky at the entrance where they broil and grill their meat to bring you an instantaneous aromatic introduction. This is also where you get to glance at the huge wall menu with a long food counter with all sorts of eye-popping meat, rice, beans and all the Mexican goodies you can imagine.\n\nI've been to here twice, once for dinner on a weeknight another on a festive weekend that had a celebratory mariachi band where the place was bursting with people from all walks of life. On my first visit my super vegetarian burrito ($5.25) came with complimentary chips, black beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I wasn't too impressed with their burrito as it was dry on the spots that were without guacamole. I thought it had too much fresh lettuce and the salsa was bland. It wasn't the most flavorful and the experience was over-dependent on the red and green salsa located at each table.\n\nMy second visit I ordered a chicken tamal and pork tamal with rice, black beans, lettuce, guacamole, and salsa ($7.75). The chicken tamal was dry and bland but the pork tamal was tasty with tender fat trimmings to keep me engaged the whole time. I thought the rice and beans were decent but the complimentary chips could be better warmed and salted. Salsa again could and should include chopped jalapeno to induce a spicy kick instead of letting it fell flat. My order of large melon aqua fresca ($2.50) was refreshing and a nice finisher. I did not receive my stack of tortillas even though it was clearly stated on the menu. \n\nOverall, I thought their prices were higher than others in the Mission while in exchange the food had very good portions but the flavor was not exciting enough to match its beautiful decor. I saw many Mexican customers ordering their carne asada so that might be a dish to look into for those interested.

On the other side of the plate was a big pile of warm black beans. Flanking all of this was rice, shredded lettuce a ladleful of guacamole and what looked to be a slice of the world's largest tomatoes (see photo).

I made friends with the manager, who told me he was the owner's son. I can't remember his name but he was always super nice  to me and whoever I brought in there with me. Sometimes he would be flirty, but nothing too weird. I did get a sense he was a pervert on the DL, but it didn't bother me.\n\nOne night  I went in there and he chatted me up for a really long time and then he walked me 24th street. I thought it was funny, but I was like, oh he's just being friendly. So we get to the bart station and I say \"okay well, good night\" and he lunges at me and attempts to stick his tongue down my throat! I don't really remember what I said but I know I booked it down those stairs and ran to hop on a train as fast as I could.\n\nThe next few weeks I fretted about it, cuz while I wasn't really mad at him, I felt like I couldn't go in there to get food. And that made me sad. Eventually I returned to Corneta and the guy was just nice as usual, maybe a bit quiet, maybe a bit embarrassed. I never brought it up. That was so long ago, and the last few times I went there more recently he wasn't there. I have been informed that he was fired, and also that he was NOT the owner's son! \n\nSo all that being said, Corneta's food isn't exactly spectacular(especially with the other neighborhood options).

I don't know if I'm using the right word to describe it, but its def different when you bite into it. \n\nThey give you a generous basket of huge chips and lots of pico de gallo salsa.
