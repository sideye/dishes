Had no issues whatsoever with the reservation, though it seemed like it would have been okay without one. It wasn't too busy at noon.\n\nThe brunch menu is pretty limited, but there were some fantastic choices (everything looked delicious). Your typical eggs benedict/french toast options, as well as some fancier/expensive options. They have a bottomless mimosa for $14! (Their cocktails looked rather good as well, would try them too if not for the mimosa...) Highly recommended. They definitely did not hesitate to give us refills, and were definitely generous with the alcohol side (though they might have started light). They give you some bread/butter to start too.\n\nThe staff was incredibly attentive. Always had water, always had drinks, and food came out incredibly quickly for what we ordered. We were feeling a little bit fancier, so we ended up getting the steamed mussels with white wine and garlic (highly recommended) and the New York steak with the shallot and cabernet sauvignon sauce. Both came with french fries and mayo/ketchup on the side.\n\nThe mussels were really quite delicious. That sauce! Probably terrible for you, but it was the right amount of salty and savory. The steak came with a small salad on the side and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Paired with the sauce was definitely perfect. Portions seemed just right (tons of mussels, two small medallions worth of steak, which was more than enough for me) and between the two of us we were able to finish all of our food and still have room for dessert (pleasantly full for sure).\n\nAfter such a pleasant Sunday afternoon experience, we couldn't resist ordering the vanilla bean cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e as well, which was very tasty; the perfect amount of sweetness with a nice crunchy top shell.\n\nTwas not a cheap brunch. I'll give it that (we also ordered... a lot). All in all came out to be about $40 a person (before tip) for the whole thing... but it was sooooooo worth it. Would definitely go back to try their dinner and prix fixe menu, since my friend recommended it and it seemed to be very reasonable for a French restaurant. If anything, the service really made this place shine! Definitely small, could see it getting crowded, and the seats are pretty tightly packed next to each other. Still somehow managed to feel very cosy with very little space.\n\nPlaces like this are what makes San Francisco great to eat and experience!

Set up like a quirky cafe, serving solid staples, I could not believe how authentic the baguettes were crackling as we bit into them greedily after smearing thawed butter onto the slices. They even got stiff and bland when cold--perfect for swabbing up sauce!\n\nThe foie in the foie gras terrine were whole lobes and pinkish textured decadence served with balsamic reduction to offset the mind numbing richness.\n\nThe hangar steak with fries was dressed in a port (?) reduction that was heady and complex. Fries were perfectly crispy and fluffy and so well seasoned I did not need to add anything to it.\n\nThe cassoulet was heavy in the white beans. But... succulent pork cubes, alluring sausage morsels and rich duck confit leg quarter made this dish the headliner of the evening. It was served in a cast iron receptacle that kept the dish a tad too warm for my liking. At the end when the entree cooled, I could taste more of the Herbs de Provence which I adore. Given that there are at least several valid interpretations of cassoulet, this being one, we prefer the example containing chevre and lamb. \n\nThe pain perdu was intriguing. It was like a really dense french toast until you take a swipe at the ice cream and caramel sauce then some kind of wizardry happens in your mouth.\n\nThe creme brulee had thick crackle. And the creme was good. But not exceptional. \n\nThe service was old school fabulous. The maitre'd offered to check our coats when he seated us and offered sparkling or regular water. Our table setting was reset each time dishes were cleared and a new basket of bread brought out without request. When the entree was cleared, the table was swept and dessert menus brought out. When I inadvertently ordered a white wine with the meal, the server graciously and gently pointed it out, then proceeded to recommend a wine for our meal.\n\nThe Prix Fixe at $28 for 3 courses is a bargain if you want the items featured. Other wise,  the 3 courses would me more like $40-$45 a person.\n\nIf I had the items I ordered at the Prix Fixe price, this place would be a no brainer 5 star, and the reservation list even longer certainly.

The greens however were completely drenched in the vinaigrette like wet laundry. I lifted up a forkful of them to find a pool of vinaigrette underneath. Ugh, so much for quenching that salad craving.\n\nOthers in the group, ordered the French Soup which they couldn't finish because they said, it was too salty.\n\nTo play it safe, I ordered the most raved about dish on Yelp for my entree: Cassoulet w/ duck confit, pork, toulouse sausage & beans ($29): http://bit.ly/1aL2rLr. Oh dear, this classic French comfort dish was crazy salty. I had to take a bite of bread with each spoonful to neutralize the salt. My friend ordered the same thing and she too had trouble eating the cassoulet. The only edible portion was the duck confit meat underneath the skin because it wasn't exposed to the pungently salty bean stew. I brought the leftovers to work the next day thinking my palate was probably just screwed up that night but had to chuck it after one bite and go to the vending machine to buy a granola bar for lunch. :X\n\nDisappointed with the apps, salads/soups and entrees, we each ordered our own dessert.

The decor feels Parisian without even trying. We arrived early and found a couple of seats at the bar. My wife started with a glass of French white wine and me a Hine sidecar. My drink was perfectly mixed with just the right amounts of lemon and Cointreau and the brandy warmed my body on a cold San Francisco evening. My wife's wine choice was perfect and thanks to our nice bartender who helped selecting it for her.\n\nOur friends arrived right on time and the owner (who recognized our friend), came right over and sat us at a nice quiet table for four in the corner.

I went with the osso-buco de boeuf with polenta. I also asked for a side of French fries of course, which by the way I don't care what you order just get the damn frites! My wife shared a salad to start which I don't remember what it was called, but we both loved it! One of my favorite salads ever! \n\nOur entrees arrived perfectly paced after our starters along with a French red wine that our celebrity friend picked out. Again, I wish I could remember what it was, because it was excellent and perfectly paired with our dinner. My beef was perfectly prepared and super tender. No knife was needed at all. The polenta was a a little different than most and had a more sticky consistency and was mixed with vegetables (carrots and peas). It was delicious and I like the fact that it was more robust than your typical polenta and stood up to the osso-bucco. The menu also included rabbit which my wife orders 99 out 100 times whenever it's offered.

We went on a Saturday night and the service was awful from the start.  It took 30 minutes before the waitress took our order.  The table next to us also had to wait a long time.  The New York steak was cold and the butter couldn't even melt it was so cold.  The french fries looked and tasted as if they had been reheated several times.  The waitress was no where to be found.  We finally flagged down the bus boy and told him in Spanish our food was terrible and he replaced it.  The second time the food was cooked properly and was Okay, but nothing to write home about.  Le Zinc on 24th Street and Chou Chou on Laguna are MUCH better French restaurants.  The table next to us waited 45 minutes for their food to come out.  When they complained to the waitress she said \"that is the french way\"  They were Indian and had specifically asked if the Scallions had bacon.  They were told no and the Scallions did have bacon.  They were celebrating a birthday dinner and the person paying couldn't eat his dinner.  AGAIN, no waitress to tell about the problem.  Another table had the waitress spill carmel on her shirt.  Finally the waitress came by our table and I was able to tell her about the first steak being terrible and that the busboy had helped us.  The table next to us just wanted the bill.  They waited another half an hour for the bill.  When the waitress came with the bill she said \"I hope you enjoyed  your dinner\" and they were finally able to tell her they didn't because the Scallions had bacon.  She just smiled and said thanks for telling me.  Then she came back and told them they would take the meal off the bill.  They had to wait again for another bill.  This is the worst place I've ever been to.  There are so many French restaurants in the city that I would advice anyone to skip this place and go to either Le Zinc or Chou Chou.  If you are in Glen Park and are hungry, go across the Street and grab a burrito at La Corneta.  The food is better and you'll save a lot of money.", "rating": 1, "date": "2008-06-07"}]}
