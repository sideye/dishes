This place is delicious. \n\nI LOVE TACOLICIOUS.\n\nTacos - Omfg SO GOOD. First lets get the cost out of the way. Yes, each taco is $4.95 each. Yes, for a taco. Should you care? ...NO. Just do it. Just allow yourself to drift slowly into taco heaven and think about the bill later. \n\nMy favorite tacos:\nChicken chile verde\nCarnitas\nGuajillo-braised beef (probably #1)\nSkirt steak carne asada\n(they are all good - but the meat is just so good I usually stick to these)\n\nSalsa - they have 3 homemade salsas they give you (red, green and habanero. I am obsessed with the habanero. It's not burn your face off hot or anything but it is slightly sweet and brings a considerable amount of heat. \n\nSalad - GET THE MARINA GIRL SALAD. It's in the top 5 salads I've ever eaten in my life. The homemade vinaigrette they put on it is out of this world. You can get it either with chicken or without. If I'm having only a salad I'll get chicken, but I've you're doing tacos I would skip the chicken. The salad is so delicious you won't miss the chicken.  \n\nMargaritas - just as good as the tacos. Every single cocktail on the menu is to die for. I usually do get a pitcher of the house margaritas and keep it simple but I've tried all of the other cocktails and they are all delicious. They are made with top quality ingredients and you can taste the difference. \n\nAtmosphere - there is a cute patio that holds maybe 30 people? It has an amazing mural of the entire Mission that is beautiful to have in the background. The inside is really cute and extremely well decorated. Even the dishes and utensils are trendy and beautiful. I believe the owner handpicks all of the decor and utensils,etc. \n\nLocal tips - there is a sister bar called Mosto that is adjoined to the restaurant that also serves tacos, but they only have one kind. If the restaurant is too busy, you can pop next door and grab a cocktail or have a tequila flight while you wait for your table. They have a large selection of tequila. Another tip that I'm hiding at the bottom of my review because I don't want to be banned from taco heaven is that I usually cheat and get two tacos and turn them into 4 tacos. Each taco comes with a ton of meat and two tortillas so I usually just quickly shuffle them around into 4 tacos. \n\nThe best part is there are multiple Tacolicious locations so I can run all over San Francisco and not go tacolicious-less.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-02-01"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered 10 tacos for $39.95 and marina girl salad for $13.25."], "author": "Michael D.", "review": "I went here for lunch with coworkers and the atmosphere was great.

It's definitely been watered down for an American palate.  This time, even though I don't really eat chicken, I tried the chicken mole colorado taco at the recommendation of Telmo, just to prove I'm not high-maintenance! It was pretty good, but seemed watered down (not a thick, rich, smoky mole at all, and yes, I know there are other kinds, but it did leave me wishing it was a little richer). The saving grace was the queso, and I'm pretty sure that was imported, at least as far as from La Palma... \n\nI also ordered the guacamole, which, while made with nice ripe avocados, was basically avocado and cilantro. I loaded on some of the haba\u00f1ero salsa (which, incidentally, isn't super spicy, so don't be shy trying it even if you don't normally like spicy stuff) to perk it up a bit and it was tasty that way. \n\nAlso, no self-respecting Mission chick is going to order the \"Marina Girl Salad\" (well actually my friend did, but she lives in Oakland so it doesn't count).

Waitstaff was good about asking our subsequent margaritas to be made with less sweetener. 5 stars. Looking forward to trying out some of the other variations and Tequilas. Really looking forward. Buying stock in Tylenol. \n\nAnddd last but not least, Churros y chocolate. The churros were truly as they should be. Piping hot fresh from the fryer, liberally sprinkled with azucar y canela. They were still tender in the middle, as they should be. The chocolate dipping sauce was also a bit watered down compared to the thick richness I've encountered in Spain and parts of Mexico, but it was flavorful. I pretty much annihilated those churros. Sharing is overrated. Aww yeah, I'll have to run double-time tomorrow. Ouch.\n\nI'll be back, and still really hoping to upgrade to 4 stars. I want to love the food MOAR. You can do it!!

It has an amazing mural of the entire Mission that is beautiful to have in the background. The inside is really cute and extremely well decorated.

If the restaurant is too busy, you can pop next door and grab a cocktail or have a tequila flight while you wait for your table. They have a large selection of tequila. Another tip that I'm hiding at the bottom of my review because I don't want to be banned from taco heaven is that I usually cheat and get two tacos and turn them into 4 tacos. Each taco comes with a ton of meat and two tortillas so I usually just quickly shuffle them around into 4 tacos. \n\nThe best part is there are multiple Tacolicious locations so I can run all over San Francisco and not go tacolicious-less.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-02-01"}], "housemade chorizo with potatoes": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the baja-style pacific cod, housemade chorizo with potatoes, guajillo-braised beef brisket, and traditional carnitas.

Still waiting. so I had my girlfriend go ask how long the wait was going to be for a seat. She said another 15-20 min. Girrrrl you said that the first time. So we have been waiting for at least 30-40 min now. That's why I am giving this place 4 stars for the wait.

It has an amazing mural of the entire Mission that is beautiful to have in the background. The inside is really cute and extremely well decorated. Even the dishes and utensils are trendy and beautiful. I believe the owner handpicks all of the decor and utensils,etc. \n\nLocal tips - there is a sister bar called Mosto that is adjoined to the restaurant that also serves tacos, but they only have one kind. If the restaurant is too busy, you can pop next door and grab a cocktail or have a tequila flight while you wait for your table. They have a large selection of tequila. Another tip that I'm hiding at the bottom of my review because I don't want to be banned from taco heaven is that I usually cheat and get two tacos and turn them into 4 tacos.

First of all, no, we didn't finish the corn after taking our first bites, and secondly, what kind of a response is that?! Your corn is disgusting, and the only appropriate response is to say sorry and remove the remaining charred salty untouched corn from our table. After saying \"I'll talk to my manager\" and some serious eye rolling, she ignored us and only after we called her back over did she say \"I was gonna tell you at the end of the meal, we're going to take off one order of the corn.\" \n\nI will give them this: the drinks were good, and the cod tacos were great. But I won't be returning. $60+ is too much to be paying for unsolicited sass from a rude waitress.", "rating": 1, "date": "2017-07-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The fish taco was delicately crafted with a tempura battered fish nestled in a bed of pickled veggies, cream sauce, and two grilled corn tortillas.

"], "author": "Susan L.", "review": "Service: Really spotty. We were seated rather quickly on a Saturday evening at 5ish with a party of 8, including 5 kids - good news, yes? Hmm, not so fast. We were seated at a table for 6, even though along with our party of 8 - PLUS, we also had a stroller with a sleeping baby in it. When a table for 8 right next to ours opened up - just after we'd been seated - we were told we would not be accommodated. As a result, we were pretty crunched for space: after our tacos arrived - served family-style - my spouse had no room for a plate for him to eat his dinner.\n\nEach of the 5 kids at our table ordered kid's meals, which I thought was a great value - $7 for one taco, rice, beans, drink & ice cream. However, our waitress forgot all of the kid's drinks. When I brought it to her attention that the kids had not received their drinks long after the kids had received their taco dinners, instead of apologizing, the waitress simply asked, \"Oh, did they want those?\" Um, yes - kids *do* like drinks, especially when it's ordered as part of their meal. The wait staff took quite a while to take our orders. Once our order was placed, the waitress forgot to bring my spouse his beer. It also took a long time to get any wait staff member's attention so we could ask for our bill.\n\nFood: The chips placed on the table after we sat down were fresh and the salsa was positively divine! I was told the ceviche was also great. The grilled corn was flavorful. My fish tacos were more heavily battered than I would have liked, but the cabbage slaw on top was fresh. My daughter's chicken taco was too spicy for her - had the kid's menu said the chicken tacos were spicy, we could've ordered her the non-spicy fish tacos instead. Thankfully, I'd ordered enough o I could share my fish tacos with her.\n\nConclusion: With so many great options on Valencia Street, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-09-15"}], "traditional churros con chocolate": [], "chocotacoliciou": [], "coconut flan": []}
