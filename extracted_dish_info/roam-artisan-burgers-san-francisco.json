In attempt to be more \"healthy\", I decided to go with Elk which is very low in fat (.9% Fat).\n\n*TEJANO \"ELK\" BURGER w/ Pepper Jack, Jalape\u00f1o Relish, Avocado, Tomato, White Corn Strips & Herb Ranch ($7.99 +$1.99 for Elk): YUMMY (sans the Elk)!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6wUNarxe7sJTriiqLjZHAA?select=1W59d7yr6msmOss4lEcQzg\n\nNestled between the toasted fluffy sesame bun was the elk patty draped with the melted pepper jack cheese and topped with slices of avocado, tomatoes, corn strips and smearing of jalapeno relish and herb ranch. \n\nEverything about the burger was mouth-watering except for the MOST important part of the burger...THE PATTY. The elk was overcooked making it very dry with a crumbly texture. It was my first time having elk and it had an assertive gamey flavor which was very overwhelming. I did like the creamy, spicy, buttery rich, tangy and crunchy texture from the other accoutrements through. Had I went with the bison or beef, I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed my burger. \n\n*FRY-FECTA - Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries & Zucchini Onion Haystack ($5.49): An ALMOST Solid Combo!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6wUNarxe7sJTriiqLjZHAA?select=XByD_LY0uJAA_fDNwIiUzA\n\nThe sweet potato fries were crisp throughout with a delicate sweetness that was heightened with the sprinkle of salt. The zucchini onion haystack was my favorite as it was light and crispy with a delicate sweet oniony flavor. It was like eating the gourmet version of the canned French's Potato Stick. It would have made a great addition to my burger if I didn't already have the white corn strips for crunch. The russet potato fries on the other hand arrived room temperature and were limp and soggy. \n\n\n*SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE w/ Brul\u00e9ed Marshmallow ($4.99 + $1 Bruleed Marshmallow): The BEST Fat-Free Thing I EVER Ate!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6wUNarxe7sJTriiqLjZHAA?select=CThOu3FZ7s9JqZkQ-W314A\n\nTrying to keep my fatASSery dinner as \"healthy\" as possible, I opted my milkshake be made with Straus' Non-Fat Frozen Yogurt. Topping the thick salted caramel milkshake was the crown jewel...the bruleed marshmallow with a waffle cone tip (ok, maybe not so \"fat-free\" after all). The milkshake had a nice caramelized burnt sugar flavor with a subtle saltiness. The yogurt added a tanginess which really help lighten the milkshake. The crown jewel, the bruleed marshmallow was SOOOO EFFEN GOOD! The light torching created a perfect crackling brown crust that was crisp and the marshmallow was like eating a oooey goooey fluffy cloud of sugar. The buttery waffle cone added a nice crisp texture contrast. NO milkshake is complete without this bruleed marshmallow, so it's a MUST!\n\nS E R V I C E:\nThe cashiers were ok; neither friendly nor rude.

The menu is on the right hand wall and the chic spot offers a whole bunch of different creative burgers with a variety of meats including beef, turkey, bison, and veggie. For me, it was a tough pick between the Pacific Blue (bleu cheese burger) and the Tejano (jalapeno-infused burger) with beef. I ended up getting the Tejano, which was a nice burger with avocado, jalapeno relish, pepperjack cheese, and crispy white corn stripes (similar to fritos but not as hard). It was a very delicious burger that isn't like anything I've ever tasted before-- crunchy but not too hard and needless to say, very VERY flavorful. Definitely coming back to try the bleu cheese offering next time. You can also design your own burger which is nice but I figured I would just leave the burger-crafting up to the professionals.\n\nWe also got the Fry-Fecta which comes with the zucchini onion stack, fries, and sweet potato fries.

I paid $17 for a bison bacon cheeseburger and fries. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked (bad sign), and for the price, I was expecting a good-sized burger. What I got was barely larger than a fast food burger, with a generic, meh-tasting bun. I like a dripping pink bison burger cooked medium, and this did not taste like bison. Frankly, the meat tasted like frozen cafeteria hamburger. It had that weird twinge you get from the frostbitten patty you forgot about in the back of your freezer. You know, the one you regretfully turn to on a night you're too lazy to get take-out and you're out of better options, like cereal.\n\nOn top of that, they charged me for the bacon part of the bacon cheeseburger, but failed to put the bacon ON the burger. That's a pretty important component of a bacon cheeseburger.\n\nUPDATE: I had reached out to Roam about my experience, and they have handled it very professionally.

I was in a major burger mood today, and I was majorly hungry.\n\nI got the beef BBQ burger. I asked for the burger to be medium; it came out somewhere between rare & medium rare. VERY pink. I prefer little to no pink in a burger. This was a big turn off for me. The BBQ sauce was so lightly flavorful, and the other flavors of this burger worked so well together, I was pleasantly surprised. But IMO unless you're at a top tier restaurant, eating raw meats is pretty unsafe. And especially meats like turkey, bison, & elk that are served here, these need to be cooked through to kill off any bugs. I try not to eat raw meat very often. Carpaccio at a good Italian restaurant is one rare exception. And I'll eat a medium-rare steak on occasion at a really good steak house. And sushi. Other than that, I try to cook everything thoroughly.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta (great name) gave me a chance to sample their different fries. I liked the sweet potato fries. The zucchini onion haystack had a very nice flavor, thinly cut spirals of fried veggies, gently crunchy on the outside, sweet & soft on the inside. The russet fries are what you're used to. The diced parsley gave a nice color & fresh taste & aroma to the whole bowl of fries.\n\nI tried the mint chocolate chip shake w/bruleed marshmallow. The shake was relatively thin (I wish it was thicker; maybe a frozen glass/mug or some cream would help?), but tasty, & the tiny chocolate bits sprinkled over the top were quite good. And the bruleed marshmallow was a great touch. A marshmallow braised over the top of a triangular cookie of some type. This worked really well with the shake. I ate that first actually.\n\nI also got an agave soda. It's effectively an italian soda. A unique flavor. It wasn't amazing, but good.\n\nThe restaurant was busy when I got there, but the waitstaff quickly worked through the line. The server quickly brought my drinks, then my food.\n\nI understand that the restaurant is using a lot of sustainable ingredients, which I'm all for, that's part of the reason I decided to try it out. And the price of each individual item seems reasonable. But it's amazing how fast you can blast through $26 in this place.\n\nThis is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant. I wasn't blown away. I think I was most disappointed over their glossing over how I wanted my burger cooked. If you are the type of person who would get angry & return your food over something like that, then this is not the restaurant for you.\n\nUsually I have an easier time reviewing restaurants than this. Either a restaurant is great no matter the cost, or good for the value, or bad for the value, or just straight out bad food. It's not great, and it's not bad, so I can axe out those two. I think the problem is, do I feel I got a good meal? Other than the burger not being cooked the way I wanted, yes. Do I feel I overpaid? Yes. I feel I ate a good meal, just not a $26 one. I know the value of a dollar, I know how long I have to work to earn one. I'm not wowed by what I just ate for the money I spent. I don't mind paying a lot for a great meal, I just don't think this was it.\n\nBTW, this part of SF has a lot of stores, bars, and food, and lots of people walking around.

I sent mine back and, not surprisingly, it came back seconds later after everything had been scraped off. Not a huge deal but still a little irksome.The huge offense though - both of our 'no pink' patties were nearly raw in the middle. It was a little too dark to notice and I was a little too hungry to care but I'd be concerned to go there in the future and trust that my meat was cooked properly.\n\nBut the bottom line is that Roam has immense potential. My boyfriend and I talked to the owner, Josh, about these issues before leaving and he was completely receptive and appreciative of the feedback. I probably would've gone back anyway, but I feel much more confident about their ability to iron out the wrinkles knowing that there's at least one person there who really cares about the quality of the food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-07-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Bison burger is organic.

Its a pretty small place, and the tables are close together.  When it's crowded, people are standing everywhere waiting for tables. Waiters are dodging around people to deliver drinks.  There's no order to the process of getting a table, so people who came in after you get a table first if they are closer when the table opens up.

Their selection of meats is great, from \"regular\" grass-fed beef to turkey to veggie, but they also feature bison and elk.  Then you get to choose from a plethora of toppings, including fried egg!  I had the truffle burger the first time, which unfortunately is so inundated with truffle oil that I could've been eating cardboard and it would've still been delicious.  The second time I came, I had the classic bison burger, which is now among my favorite burgers of all time, juicy and great meaty flavor without as much fat.  Be warned, these burgers tend to fall apart on you, as the sesame seed bun cannot contain the combo of juicy meat and sometimes slightly damp produce toppings.  The sweet potato fries offer a mixture of crisped outside and soft sweet inside to just crispy bits, kind of like what happens when you get to the bottom of a carton of McDonald's fries (I find this to be a good thing).  The truffle parmesan over their regular fries is a great combo, not overwhelming like the burger.  The zucchini onion haystack really needs to be eaten with a fork and is the least memorable of the 3.  The artisan sodas are also delicious, and I look forward to trying the elk and milkshakes next time.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-09-02"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the classic beef burger --GREAT quality beef especially for this price ", "--and sweet potato fries and it hit the spot.

And so, even after I had quenched my initial post hike appetite with a donut, biscuits and gravy, a breakfast sandwich, orange juice, a pizza, and possibly some snacks, I was still intent on getting my burger. \n\nA plan was made, a route was mapped, and I was burgerbound.\n\nRoam is a counter-order affair, which I kinda like. Sometimes you want to sit down and be served, but it's nice being able to belly up to the bar for fast casual and make your order, then eat in peace. I bellied, I ordered the French and Fries, and also the Fryfecta, and also a chocolate shake. Don't judge--I'd been burning thousands and only eating hundreds of calories per day for almost a week. I needed to restore the balance.\n\nIt wasn't as tidy of an ordering process as I thought--but that's not bad. You just have decisions to make. What kind of bun, what kind of meat, how pink your meat will be; this is a custom joint. I ordered (sesame seed bun, beef, and of course, pink) and we were on our way to sit down.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly, and I set off to work. The burger was adorned with a few truffle-parmesan fries which gave it some depth, but the real money was from the piquant sauce. I still don't know what that is entirely for them, but the basic idea behind a piquant sauce is that it's a sharp or strong flavor. This is a French burger, so why not hearken to the French cuisine and make a sauce piquant. Look it up. Piquant--having a pleasantly sharp taste or appetizing flavor. It was bright, but not overwhelming, and even though I do love fries, avocado, caramelized onions, mustard, and greens, that sauce won the day.\n\nThe Fryfecta--a platter of normal fries, sweet potato ones, and shoestring fried zucchini strands, was a good call. The shreds are just hard to eat without a fork, so don't think of them as fries. They're more a side dish for forking. But still, we dipped in ketchup and I dipped my fries into my shake, and they were salty salvation.\n\nThe real money, though, was on that chocolate shake. It's the real deal. So creamy, and the ice cream they use has a nice base. The chocolate was smooth, neither too astringent or too blonde, but a rich and easy to swallow brown and beautiful creation.\n\nOverall, my post-hike belly was tamed. Mission accomplished. At $50 for two of us, it was a little more than I usually pay, but this is not exactly a side-of-the-road ma and pop in a small town shack. I went all out, but maybe would reel it in a little bit next time to keep it more affordable.

Since the sauces for the burgers are free, they make great dipping sauces for the fries. The zucchini onion haystack goes particularly well in the burgers.

The menu is full of interesting and delicious-sounding burgers. We finally got the chance to try it and I'm pretty disappointed. Really, this is a 2.5 star review. 3 for the food, 2 for the service. \n\nWhen we ordered, I was told I could either have \"pink in the middle\" or \"not pink in the middle\". Apparently \"pink in the middle\" equates to medium rare and when I asked if I could have it medium she said, \"well, we can try but when it's busy we either do it pink or not pink.\" Um, okay, for a burger place, that's kind of ridiculous. It took FOREVER to get our food - about 15 minutes for our drinks and probably 30 minutes in total for our food which would have ordinarily been probably not a huge deal but it wasn't very busy. \n\nAs for the food, I'd give it a 3 overall. My fiance's burger (he ordered the French and Fries) was actually pretty tasty. However, he asked for pink in the middle and it was definitely cooked all the way through. I ordered the BBQ burger but there was hardly any coleslaw (just about a tablespoon) and the bun had the tiniest smear of BBQ sauce which you couldn't even taste when you ate it - I had to ask for extra. Additionally, my burger wasn't even close to being medium. It was very, very, very medium rare (closer to the rare side with a good sear on each side). You could tell that the burger and all the fixings were high quality and a lot of it tasted good, the proportions were just totally off and it was improperly cooked. \n\nOverall, it wasn't a great experience.

The elk was overcooked making it very dry with a crumbly texture. It was my first time having elk and it had an assertive gamey flavor which was very overwhelming.

Topping the thick salted caramel milkshake was the crown jewel...the bruleed marshmallow with a waffle cone tip (ok, maybe not so \"fat-free\" after all). The milkshake had a nice caramelized burnt sugar flavor with a subtle saltiness. The yogurt added a tanginess which really help lighten the milkshake. The crown jewel, the bruleed marshmallow was SOOOO EFFEN GOOD! The light torching created a perfect crackling brown crust that was crisp and the marshmallow was like eating a oooey goooey fluffy cloud of sugar.

The properly cooked juicy patty could not fully compensate for the lack of heat in the supposed jalapeno relish, the tomato that was a few shades shy of red, and soggy tortilla strips/buns.\n\nAdditionally, the zucchini onion haystack was a lot less playful than it sounded.  I felt like I ate pure oil-drenched batter with minimal amounts of vegetables.\n\nI've been meaning to drop by again some day, but it's hard to move past that first experience.

I wasn't sure exactly how/where to start and the menu doesn't clearly specify how things work but I got an orientation from one of the friendly busers (is that a word?) and he was most helpful, as was the guy who had just enjoyed the Bison Tejano and couldn't recommend it more highly.

I was a little worried that I'd get some gigantic thing I couldn't wrap my mouth around but no ... it was a perfect size making it easy to  get a proper bite which includes the perfect blend of bun (both the bottom and top) meat and delicious avocado, pepper jack, ranch love.  Oh my.  The flavors melded and came on slowly in my mouth, multiplying little by little until BAM!  I had to  pause for a moment and experience the sensation that took over my entire body.  \nOoh, there's a kick front he jalape\u00f1o jack! Mmm creamy love from the avocado.  Yes, yes yes juicy goodness of the ranch mixed in with Bison.  Whoa.  Very nice.  \n2.  Bison is delicious.  I was afraid it would be gamey - I can't do venison at all.  Bison is nothing like venison.  Hurrah.  And I understand it has less fat so that's a bonus. \n3.  I ordered the regular fries to go with my burger.

The time spent in the SF-loves-waiting-in-lines-Tumblr-worthy line and my table-snagging success were thus in vain, and we decided to try this location instead. Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.\n\nCompared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. \n\n(+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. \n\n(++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.\n\n(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.\n\n(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.\n\n(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright. Maybe it's Instagram syndrome because the presentation in the metal tin is simply beautiful. The regular fries and sweet potato fries were good but not completely out of the ordinary, and the boys didn't like the zucchini onion haystack so I had it all to myself :x To be honest it tastes mostly like fried batter since the zucchini and onion are very thin, but the texture (along with the taste of fried batter, of course) is quite addicting. I garnished my deconstructed sunny side with strings of the haystack and it looked very fancy, reminiscent of artsy Umami burgers and the like.\n\nOverall, Roam has one of the better burgers I've tried, with a reasonable but above-average $10 price tag--the satisfying dinner was worth the hilly 1-mile Roam from the Fillmore location.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the Sunny Side with an egg, arugula, and cheese.

The place was a good size and the tables weren't too squished together so you had enough elbow room to really dig into your burger a-la Adam Richman Man vs. Food style.\n\nServed cafe-style, you order once you enter the restaurant and a waiter brings your food based on the corresponding number they give you once you order. I ordered the Sunny Side burger with a regular beef patty, though they do serve alternate meat options such as a Turkey, Bison, or Veggie burgers. Also, I got a blood-red orange soda and spent a little over $10- which I think is expensive since I didn't get fries- but, hey- it's suppose to be artisan right? Thankfully my friend ordered sweet potato fries so I was able to try them without shelling out even more dough.\n\nThe Sunny Side burger was ahh-maze-ing. Even the presentation of the burger was delightful- each layer stacked perfectly on top of one another- bun, grilled onions chopped up and melted together with cheese, sunny-side-up egg, tomato, topped with fresh arugula and finished with the sesame seed bun.  You could tell they were serving top quality beef because the burger patty was resilient when you bit into it and, while fatty, delicious juice dripped down from the burger, the meat was still perfectly intact and not crumbling to pieces after you took a gargantuan bite out of it (seriously, it's one of those burgers you have to practically dislocate your jaw just so you can get your mouth around it, but not complaints here!). The taste was even better than its physical appeal. Everything was fresh- not a wilted leaf or soggy tomato in any bite! You need to try it for yourself.\n\nOkay, to be clear... I loved the burger. If I lived in SF, they would have my continued business just based on the quality of their burger alone. BUT, I want to say the service wasn't that great, the blood-orange soda was almost painful to drink, and the sweet potato fries were- JUST- sweet potato fries... nothing too special about them.\n\n You know... you go into an artisan burger joint and expect to get artisan service. No, the person to took my order simply asked what I wanted and scooted me away- no smile, no personable conversation- mind you, I was the only person in line! Really? For the $10 I spent for a burger and drink in addition to the $2 tip I just gave you, you should probably be a wee bit nicer to your customers. Luckily, the bus boy who wiped down my table was friendly enough to smile. As far as the blood-orange soda, YIKES! Do NOT go there... it was almost like drinking what I believe Orange Glo cleaner would taste like- very acidic to the point where it burns going down. SMH\n\nLike I said, I would definitely go back to Roam Artisan Burgers simply for the delicious burgers; however, everything else at this joint just wasn't so great. Perhaps that's why they called it Roam Artisan Burgers instead of Roam Artisan Restaurant because everything aside from the burgers was pretty mediocre.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-12-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Sunny Side Bison Burger (minus the sugary onions because I have a thing against mixing my sweets with my meats).

When prepared as is, the burger consists of pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1o relish, avocado, tomato, white corn strips, and herb ranch.

This little substitute made a world of difference on my palate.\n\nMy advice would be to pick apart and tweak your burger to your liking. While they have done an excellent job crafting signature burgers, they are not beyond reproach.

The time spent in the SF-loves-waiting-in-lines-Tumblr-worthy line and my table-snagging success were thus in vain, and we decided to try this location instead. Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.\n\nCompared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. \n\n(+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. \n\n(++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.\n\n(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.\n\n(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.\n\n(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright. Maybe it's Instagram syndrome because the presentation in the metal tin is simply beautiful. The regular fries and sweet potato fries were good but not completely out of the ordinary, and the boys didn't like the zucchini onion haystack so I had it all to myself :x To be honest it tastes mostly like fried batter since the zucchini and onion are very thin, but the texture (along with the taste of fried batter, of course) is quite addicting. I garnished my deconstructed sunny side with strings of the haystack and it looked very fancy, reminiscent of artsy Umami burgers and the like.\n\nOverall, Roam has one of the better burgers I've tried, with a reasonable but above-average $10 price tag--the satisfying dinner was worth the hilly 1-mile Roam from the Fillmore location.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I was able to sample their heritage bison burger, with a fried egg and bacon.

There is nothing more annoying than a mobbed place where you have to wait in line every time you want another beer, or another bottle of wine.

The time spent in the SF-loves-waiting-in-lines-Tumblr-worthy line and my table-snagging success were thus in vain, and we decided to try this location instead. Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.\n\nCompared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. \n\n(+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. \n\n(++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.\n\n(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.\n\n(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.\n\n(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright. Maybe it's Instagram syndrome because the presentation in the metal tin is simply beautiful. The regular fries and sweet potato fries were good but not completely out of the ordinary, and the boys didn't like the zucchini onion haystack so I had it all to myself :x To be honest it tastes mostly like fried batter since the zucchini and onion are very thin, but the texture (along with the taste of fried batter, of course) is quite addicting. I garnished my deconstructed sunny side with strings of the haystack and it looked very fancy, reminiscent of artsy Umami burgers and the like.\n\nOverall, Roam has one of the better burgers I've tried, with a reasonable but above-average $10 price tag--the satisfying dinner was worth the hilly 1-mile Roam from the Fillmore location.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The Chalet Burger: swiss cheese, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato and house sauce.

I am not a fan at all of anyplace that  makes you pay first; especially a place that sells alcohol.  There is nothing more annoying than a mobbed place where you have to wait in line every time you want another beer, or another bottle of wine.  Here, you can't even get a bottle of wine, and the 'carafe' of wine they sell you for more $$ than two glasses of wine gives you less wine than ordering two glasses of wine.\n\nI ordered the Heritage, minus the caramelized onions and with a Bison patty.  My wife ordered the Chalet with a Turkey patty.  We both split the Fry-Fecta, which is a combination of Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and a Zucchini Onion Haystack.  \n\nWhen ordering, I asked for the Bison burger to be medium rare, to which I was told matter-of-factly, all burgers with the exception of Turkey are cooked medium rare.  Apparently, the cooks do not know this; mine didn't even have a hint of pink.  Even though it wasn't done to my liking, it was still juicy, and it still tasted good.\n\nMy wife said the Turkey burger was nice and juicy and the flavors worked well, but was still average.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta was possibly the star of the meal.  Neither the Russet nor the Sweet Potato fries had much seasoning on them, but were twice fried, which was a plus.  I imagine the lack of seasoning is intentional, so you pay $7 for one of their special seasonings.  The Zucchini Onion Haystack was awesome; though it would be better with a thicker shoe-string cut.\n\nYou know when you go someplace starving and you swear you just had one of the best things you ever ate.

The menu is on the right hand wall and the chic spot offers a whole bunch of different creative burgers with a variety of meats including beef, turkey, bison, and veggie. For me, it was a tough pick between the Pacific Blue (bleu cheese burger) and the Tejano (jalapeno-infused burger) with beef. I ended up getting the Tejano, which was a nice burger with avocado, jalapeno relish, pepperjack cheese, and crispy white corn stripes (similar to fritos but not as hard). It was a very delicious burger that isn't like anything I've ever tasted before-- crunchy but not too hard and needless to say, very VERY flavorful. Definitely coming back to try the bleu cheese offering next time. You can also design your own burger which is nice but I figured I would just leave the burger-crafting up to the professionals.\n\nWe also got the Fry-Fecta which comes with the zucchini onion stack, fries, and sweet potato fries.

I didn't realize it until my burger was brought out medium well. I hate medium well. The patty tasted good and had the right amount of seasoning but because it wasn't cooked to my liking I didn't love this burger. Also, my fried egg was over cooked. The yolk on the egg was hard so I didn't get the yummy golden liquid all over my patty. All of the other elements on this burg were wonderful. The slaw was tangy and fresh, the jalapeno relish was spicy and the bacon was thick and crispy. My buddies burger patty was cooked the same as mine, which didn't seem to bother him like it did me. The fries were great, as was the blackberry soda and the shakes. I LOVED the brul\u00e9ed mallow in my shake. \n\nPrices here are actually cheap. I didn't pay over $20 for my burger, fries, soda and shake.  \n\nThe folks running this place do a great job at keeping the line moving, cleaning the tables quickly so the people waiting can sit down and they also get the food made quickly. \n\nNext time I'm gonna check out either their bison or elk burger.

"], "author": "Adam M.", "review": "After finding this restaurant listed in a \"top San Francisco restaurants\" article, and reading a few Yelp reviews, I decided to check it out. I was in a major burger mood today, and I was majorly hungry.\n\nI got the beef BBQ burger. I asked for the burger to be medium; it came out somewhere between rare & medium rare. VERY pink. I prefer little to no pink in a burger. This was a big turn off for me. The BBQ sauce was so lightly flavorful, and the other flavors of this burger worked so well together, I was pleasantly surprised. But IMO unless you're at a top tier restaurant, eating raw meats is pretty unsafe. And especially meats like turkey, bison, & elk that are served here, these need to be cooked through to kill off any bugs. I try not to eat raw meat very often. Carpaccio at a good Italian restaurant is one rare exception. And I'll eat a medium-rare steak on occasion at a really good steak house. And sushi. Other than that, I try to cook everything thoroughly.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta (great name) gave me a chance to sample their different fries. I liked the sweet potato fries. The zucchini onion haystack had a very nice flavor, thinly cut spirals of fried veggies, gently crunchy on the outside, sweet & soft on the inside. The russet fries are what you're used to. The diced parsley gave a nice color & fresh taste & aroma to the whole bowl of fries.\n\nI tried the mint chocolate chip shake w/bruleed marshmallow. The shake was relatively thin (I wish it was thicker; maybe a frozen glass/mug or some cream would help?), but tasty, & the tiny chocolate bits sprinkled over the top were quite good. And the bruleed marshmallow was a great touch. A marshmallow braised over the top of a triangular cookie of some type. This worked really well with the shake. I ate that first actually.\n\nI also got an agave soda. It's effectively an italian soda. A unique flavor. It wasn't amazing, but good.\n\nThe restaurant was busy when I got there, but the waitstaff quickly worked through the line. The server quickly brought my drinks, then my food.\n\nI understand that the restaurant is using a lot of sustainable ingredients, which I'm all for, that's part of the reason I decided to try it out. And the price of each individual item seems reasonable. But it's amazing how fast you can blast through $26 in this place.\n\nThis is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant. I wasn't blown away. I think I was most disappointed over their glossing over how I wanted my burger cooked. If you are the type of person who would get angry & return your food over something like that, then this is not the restaurant for you.\n\nUsually I have an easier time reviewing restaurants than this. Either a restaurant is great no matter the cost, or good for the value, or bad for the value, or just straight out bad food. It's not great, and it's not bad, so I can axe out those two.

It's ok, have some faith, we'll like it.  Have a nice staff that realizes it is there for us, and not the other way around.  Don't gouge us on price.

Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.\n\nCompared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. \n\n(+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. \n\n(++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.\n\n(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.\n\n(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.\n\n(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright.

The veggie burger is good - good be better. It does not hold up well. When you bite into it does kinda ooze out from each side so I ask for it a lil more cooked and I get it Chalet style.

Yes, you did just read that I said something was too sweet.  Don't worry, I am not going to be writing that something had too much bacon.  BTW - this was more of a spoon shake than a straw shake.

"], "author": "Adam M.", "review": "After finding this restaurant listed in a \"top San Francisco restaurants\" article, and reading a few Yelp reviews, I decided to check it out. I was in a major burger mood today, and I was majorly hungry.\n\nI got the beef BBQ burger. I asked for the burger to be medium; it came out somewhere between rare & medium rare. VERY pink. I prefer little to no pink in a burger. This was a big turn off for me. The BBQ sauce was so lightly flavorful, and the other flavors of this burger worked so well together, I was pleasantly surprised. But IMO unless you're at a top tier restaurant, eating raw meats is pretty unsafe. And especially meats like turkey, bison, & elk that are served here, these need to be cooked through to kill off any bugs. I try not to eat raw meat very often. Carpaccio at a good Italian restaurant is one rare exception. And I'll eat a medium-rare steak on occasion at a really good steak house. And sushi. Other than that, I try to cook everything thoroughly.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta (great name) gave me a chance to sample their different fries. I liked the sweet potato fries. The zucchini onion haystack had a very nice flavor, thinly cut spirals of fried veggies, gently crunchy on the outside, sweet & soft on the inside. The russet fries are what you're used to. The diced parsley gave a nice color & fresh taste & aroma to the whole bowl of fries.\n\nI tried the mint chocolate chip shake w/bruleed marshmallow. The shake was relatively thin (I wish it was thicker; maybe a frozen glass/mug or some cream would help?), but tasty, & the tiny chocolate bits sprinkled over the top were quite good. And the bruleed marshmallow was a great touch. A marshmallow braised over the top of a triangular cookie of some type. This worked really well with the shake. I ate that first actually.\n\nI also got an agave soda. It's effectively an italian soda. A unique flavor. It wasn't amazing, but good.\n\nThe restaurant was busy when I got there, but the waitstaff quickly worked through the line. The server quickly brought my drinks, then my food.\n\nI understand that the restaurant is using a lot of sustainable ingredients, which I'm all for, that's part of the reason I decided to try it out. And the price of each individual item seems reasonable. But it's amazing how fast you can blast through $26 in this place.\n\nThis is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant. I wasn't blown away. I think I was most disappointed over their glossing over how I wanted my burger cooked. If you are the type of person who would get angry & return your food over something like that, then this is not the restaurant for you.\n\nUsually I have an easier time reviewing restaurants than this. Either a restaurant is great no matter the cost, or good for the value, or bad for the value, or just straight out bad food. It's not great, and it's not bad, so I can axe out those two. I think the problem is, do I feel I got a good meal? Other than the burger not being cooked the way I wanted, yes. Do I feel I overpaid? Yes. I feel I ate a good meal, just not a $26 one. I know the value of a dollar, I know how long I have to work to earn one. I'm not wowed by what I just ate for the money I spent. I don't mind paying a lot for a great meal, I just don't think this was it.\n\nBTW, this part of SF has a lot of stores, bars, and food, and lots of people walking around.

It was very efficient, and the fact that it took a little while made me believe each was cooked to order.\n\nIn addition to the burger types, they also have a variety of \"add on\" options, like my selection, Sunny Side which feature an Organic Free-Range Egg, Aged White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Greens, Tomato, Sweet Chili Sauce. It was pretty delicious, specifically the chili sauce and onions. The elk burger itself was good, not fantastic. I would probably pick a regular burger or bison in the future. \n\nThe other great thing here are the fries. As long as your not alone, get the Fry-Fecta which is russet fries, sweet potato fries and zucchin/onion haystack. The best were the sweet potatoes, but the other were tasty too.\n\nOverall, the food is priced fairly, with specialtiy burgers around $8 and fries 3-4, or the fry fecta for $5.50.

Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.\n\nCompared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. \n\n(+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. \n\n(++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.\n\n(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.\n\n(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.\n\n(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright.

I think it was even a good + burger.  I do not think it was a great burger.  The core ingredients were all of high quality.  This is what tipped the overall score to four stars.  For some reason, the burger did not come together in a way to meet the sum of its parts.  I even added some of the zucchini-onion haystack to it.   Would I eat this burger again?  Yes, definitely.  Not only that, but I would thoroughly enjoy it.  Would I go across town again to get one?  Nope, nada, wouldn't do it!

It would be nice if there was a smaller size for one person. I enjoyed the haystack the most.  The fries and sweet potato fries were both decent.

I know $5 shakes.  This was no $5 shake.  Well, it was.  But, it should not have been.  This was, by far, the smallest $5 shake I've ever had.   It was also overly sweet.  The chocolate did not really come through.  There was just an overwhelming sweetness.  If you know me, and you are reading this, get up off the floor.  Yes, you did just read that I said something was too sweet.  Don't worry, I am not going to be writing that something had too much bacon.  BTW - this was more of a spoon shake than a straw shake.  I do NOT consider that a negative.  (Disclaimer - I've repeatedly referred to this as a $5 shake.  To be fair it was actually a $4.99 shake.)\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7kaqxju\n\nThe ambiance is clean and functional.  I found it to be a comfortable room to enjoy a burger.  It is not warm and cozy but not quite cold and industrial either.  When I arrived, it was relatively empty.  I was surprised by this.   It did start to pick up.  Of course, it is the Marina.  So, there was the obligatory table of two guys next to me discussing how much money they make, buying condos, and commuting to Hawaii.\n\nThe service was laid back and friendly.

I was in a major burger mood today, and I was majorly hungry.\n\nI got the beef BBQ burger. I asked for the burger to be medium; it came out somewhere between rare & medium rare. VERY pink. I prefer little to no pink in a burger. This was a big turn off for me. The BBQ sauce was so lightly flavorful, and the other flavors of this burger worked so well together, I was pleasantly surprised. But IMO unless you're at a top tier restaurant, eating raw meats is pretty unsafe. And especially meats like turkey, bison, & elk that are served here, these need to be cooked through to kill off any bugs. I try not to eat raw meat very often. Carpaccio at a good Italian restaurant is one rare exception. And I'll eat a medium-rare steak on occasion at a really good steak house. And sushi. Other than that, I try to cook everything thoroughly.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta (great name) gave me a chance to sample their different fries. I liked the sweet potato fries. The zucchini onion haystack had a very nice flavor, thinly cut spirals of fried veggies, gently crunchy on the outside, sweet & soft on the inside. The russet fries are what you're used to. The diced parsley gave a nice color & fresh taste & aroma to the whole bowl of fries.\n\nI tried the mint chocolate chip shake w/bruleed marshmallow. The shake was relatively thin (I wish it was thicker; maybe a frozen glass/mug or some cream would help?), but tasty, & the tiny chocolate bits sprinkled over the top were quite good. And the bruleed marshmallow was a great touch. A marshmallow braised over the top of a triangular cookie of some type. This worked really well with the shake. I ate that first actually.\n\nI also got an agave soda. It's effectively an italian soda. A unique flavor. It wasn't amazing, but good.\n\nThe restaurant was busy when I got there, but the waitstaff quickly worked through the line. The server quickly brought my drinks, then my food.\n\nI understand that the restaurant is using a lot of sustainable ingredients, which I'm all for, that's part of the reason I decided to try it out. And the price of each individual item seems reasonable. But it's amazing how fast you can blast through $26 in this place.\n\nThis is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant. I wasn't blown away. I think I was most disappointed over their glossing over how I wanted my burger cooked.

Either a restaurant is great no matter the cost, or good for the value, or bad for the value, or just straight out bad food. It's not great, and it's not bad, so I can axe out those two. I think the problem is, do I feel I got a good meal? Other than the burger not being cooked the way I wanted, yes. Do I feel I overpaid? Yes. I feel I ate a good meal, just not a $26 one. I know the value of a dollar, I know how long I have to work to earn one. I'm not wowed by what I just ate for the money I spent. I don't mind paying a lot for a great meal, I just don't think this was it.\n\nBTW, this part of SF has a lot of stores, bars, and food, and lots of people walking around.

Not many places in SF offer a kids menu, but this place does which is a big plus.  So the way it works is, you choose your meat (beef, turkey, bison, or veggie) then you choose your style of burger OR you can totally create your own with whatever toppings you want.  I choose the beef french and fries burger (Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard).  My BF got the beef sunny side (Organic Free-Range Egg, Aged White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Greens, Tomato, Sweet Chili Sauce).  We had the burgers as is, no substitutions.

I mentioned burgers and since they were just returning from feasting on Seafood all week long, they were ecstatic.  I did a bit of research previously and Roam popped up in the results of being a highly rated burger joint.\n\nWe loved the many meat options such as Bison, Turkey, Veggie and grass fed Beef.  Even though it isn't mentioned on-line, I remember seeing on the restaurant menu the mention of Elk for an up charge.  Two of us opted for Bison which carried an up charge of $2.99 each. \n\nI decided on the Tejano which comes with Pepper Jack, Jalape\u00f1o Relish, Avocado, Tomato, White Corn Strips, Herb Ranch.  Usually when I enjoy a burger there is a moment where despite the toppings it already has, I would dip it in some ketchup and mustard.  I just love the mixture of the two condiments and a good burger in it.  From the moment of my first bite to the savoring of the last bite I was in total bliss.  The three of us were quietly admiring the burger choices made and enjoying our spoils.  We shared a Fry-fecta which comes with a zucchini onion haystack and Russet and sweet potato fries.

Most tables suit fours and the center of the space is filled with a large communal table which could suit a party of up to twelve.  I would suggest not sending folks ahead and saving tables as most do not do that and it'd be frowned upon.  Also if you are a parent, it is obnoxious to bring double wide strollers in here.  Saw this drunken father trying to push a stroller with baby in hand between the bar and communal table without maneuvering seated folks.  It made for an ugly situation.  Since the place is uber popular, the weeknight drew in some sexy in the city types.

Be warned, these burgers tend to fall apart on you, as the sesame seed bun cannot contain the combo of juicy meat and sometimes slightly damp produce toppings.

And so, even after I had quenched my initial post hike appetite with a donut, biscuits and gravy, a breakfast sandwich, orange juice, a pizza, and possibly some snacks, I was still intent on getting my burger. \n\nA plan was made, a route was mapped, and I was burgerbound.\n\nRoam is a counter-order affair, which I kinda like. Sometimes you want to sit down and be served, but it's nice being able to belly up to the bar for fast casual and make your order, then eat in peace. I bellied, I ordered the French and Fries, and also the Fryfecta, and also a chocolate shake. Don't judge--I'd been burning thousands and only eating hundreds of calories per day for almost a week. I needed to restore the balance.\n\nIt wasn't as tidy of an ordering process as I thought--but that's not bad. You just have decisions to make. What kind of bun, what kind of meat, how pink your meat will be; this is a custom joint. I ordered (sesame seed bun, beef, and of course, pink) and we were on our way to sit down.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly, and I set off to work. The burger was adorned with a few truffle-parmesan fries which gave it some depth, but the real money was from the piquant sauce. I still don't know what that is entirely for them, but the basic idea behind a piquant sauce is that it's a sharp or strong flavor. This is a French burger, so why not hearken to the French cuisine and make a sauce piquant. Look it up. Piquant--having a pleasantly sharp taste or appetizing flavor. It was bright, but not overwhelming, and even though I do love fries, avocado, caramelized onions, mustard, and greens, that sauce won the day.\n\nThe Fryfecta--a platter of normal fries, sweet potato ones, and shoestring fried zucchini strands, was a good call. The shreds are just hard to eat without a fork, so don't think of them as fries. They're more a side dish for forking. But still, we dipped in ketchup and I dipped my fries into my shake, and they were salty salvation.\n\nThe real money, though, was on that chocolate shake. It's the real deal. So creamy, and the ice cream they use has a nice base.

The menu here is made up of burgers, sides, shakes, sodas, beer, wine and tea. What makes Roam stand out is if you feel like being adventurous  you can swap your cow patty for other animals like turkey, bison or elk. \n\nMy buddy and I came to Roam on a Friday night and found the line pretty much out the door. Roam is the type of place where you order at the bar, take a number and find a table (if you can). Luckily for us we were able to snag a small table right by the kitchen. \n\nWe ordered;\nBBQ Burger- Beef patty, aged white cheddar, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, jalapeno relish, oil & vinegar slaw, bacon & a fried egg\nBacon Cheeseburger- Beef patty, aged white cheddar, Swiss, bacon & steak sauce\nTruffle Parm Fries\nHomemade blackberry soda\nCoconut shake W/ a Brul\u00e9ed marshmallow\nHazelnut chocolate shake\n\nFirst off, I was bummed that they didn't ask how I wanted my patty cooked. I didn't realize it until my burger was brought out medium well. I hate medium well. The patty tasted good and had the right amount of seasoning but because it wasn't cooked to my liking I didn't love this burger. Also, my fried egg was over cooked. The yolk on the egg was hard so I didn't get the yummy golden liquid all over my patty. All of the other elements on this burg were wonderful. The slaw was tangy and fresh, the jalapeno relish was spicy and the bacon was thick and crispy. My buddies burger patty was cooked the same as mine, which didn't seem to bother him like it did me. The fries were great, as was the blackberry soda and the shakes. I LOVED the brul\u00e9ed mallow in my shake. \n\nPrices here are actually cheap. I didn't pay over $20 for my burger, fries, soda and shake.  \n\nThe folks running this place do a great job at keeping the line moving, cleaning the tables quickly so the people waiting can sit down and they also get the food made quickly. \n\nNext time I'm gonna check out either their bison or elk burger. I'll just make sure to ask specifically for my burger to be cooked medium rare. I probably would have given Roam 5 stars if it wasn't for my beef patty and fried egg being over cooked.

The yolk on the egg was hard so I didn't get the yummy golden liquid all over my patty. All of the other elements on this burg were wonderful. The slaw was tangy and fresh, the jalapeno relish was spicy and the bacon was thick and crispy. My buddies burger patty was cooked the same as mine, which didn't seem to bother him like it did me.
