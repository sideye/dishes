Confused, we told him we had ordered Samosa,  and he said they broke the Samosas and could not make any more so we should just eat the Pakora Instead because \"it is very good\". It wasn't.  While the batter was hot and spiced, it was overly doughy and mostly onions.  Soon after our Prawn Biriyani and Benghan Bartha Arrived.  \n\nThe Biriyani was bland, and dry.  The Shrimp weren't even marinated in the Biriyani Spices and tasted not entirely fresh.  The Rice Seemed undercooked and rushed.\n\nBenghan Bartha, overly runny. The waiter said this was one of their specialties.. I found it to be not so special. For a dish that's supposed to be made from blended Eggplant and tomatoes, this was the most liquidy, non eggplant flavored version of this dish ever. A Light brown gravy like liquid with a shred or 3 of Eggplant Skin.. \n\nAnd the Kicker was the Afghani (Kashmiri) Nan.  We were expecting a Nan with Cherry Paste and Nuts (similar to the description and what we commonly know and love as Kashmiri Nan). However what arrived (Another 10 minutes after all the food) Looked like they had picked the dried fruits out of a holiday fruit cake (you know the kind no one eats around the holidays). Little Bitz of fake wax cherries and those plasticky green mystery fruit were embedded in a paper thin slice of crispy hot nan like bread. \n\nBy this time, the cockroaches had descended on our table (no joke). After shooing off a few we decided to call it quits and pack up our leftovers (which were not gong to eat anyways) and get the $@#^& outa dodge!\n\nWhile the Waiter Seemed to be a really nice and personable (if not overly pushy) guy, the food and dirty decor were severely lac luster.\n\nI left this restaurant in a daze.. wondering \"WHY GOD WHY?\"  How could so many people on yelp actually like this place? Did they maybe get some crack in their food or get hypnotized by the pushy waiter? I guess ill never know, because you will never find me eating here again ever. \n\nCompared to any other restaurant that serves Pakistani/Indian this was by far the worst I've had in the city..", "rating": 1, "date": "2007-09-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Samosas, Vegetable Pakora, Muttar Paneer, Pappadam, and Naan. \n\n"], "author": "Kane M.", "review": "update:\nI am soooooo sad they are closed for lunch now...

We were there for an hour with 2 other tables being occupied, and at no point did ANYONE buss any of the empty tables with dirty plates and food still left on them. We did, however, see a customer buss a table by moving the last guests remains to another table and then sit down. Simply unacceptable. \n\nAlso, while we where there, they were restocking their pantry it seems. I really could have done without seeing boxes of okra and basmati rice everywhere.

Tablecloths with black dirt stains at the edge where they meet the clear plastic table top, broken soap dispenser with watered down soap in the bathroom, bathroom in general not in any great state of cleanliness, \"Order Here\" sign with big grease stain, kitchen visibly dirty from where you sit and plastic water glasses with cracks in them.

There were only two couples in the restaurant. The server and the chef seem to be on equal levels within the Lahore Karahi hierarchy -- both look to be men in their 50s, both are jovial and extremely kind. It was the chef from whom I ordered --\n\nI say:\n\n\"One cholay\"\n\"One Saag Paneer\"\n\"Do you have Nihari?\" (I had read good things about the Nihari here on Yelp but could not find it on the menu). The chef smiles back and says\n\"Yes, for you we have Nihari\"\n\"Great! One Chicken Tikka Masala\"\n\"One Chicken Boti\"\nChef interjects: \"My chicken boti is excellent, but try the fish tandoori -- it is really special\". Methinks let's give it a whirl. The chef adds that the fish (sea bass) is fresh.\n\"Oh, and one plain naan, no butter.\"\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, the tandoori fish has arrived. Oh man, was it good. I don't usually enjoy dishes like this made with seafood, but I am in LOVE with this dish. It comes on a hot skillet, simmering, covered in a zestily-dressed lettuce. At first I was avoiding the lettuce as though it were a garnish. After a few bites I started mixing the lettuce with the fish -- now THAT is the way to have it! This was one of the most incredible dishes I have ever had. I think the chicken boti at Shalimar is divine -- literally made by gods. This is equally good, but completely different -- different spices and, of course, fish instead of chicken.\n\nNext come the other dishes, minus the cholay which never came-- the chef must not have heard me order it -- which is just fine since I ordered way too much food.\n\nThe Nihari was incredible. Much tangier than at Shalimar and Chutney and, instead of being a block of beef in a stew-broth (as the dish is prepared at Shalimar and Chutney), the entire dish is shredded (and not-so-shredded) beef in a wonderful gravy. Very little sauce because the beef IS the sauce. It was incredible, though admittedly heavy.\n\nThe saag paneer (other restaurants call it palak paneer) was equally good. It was cream-based, but not too creamy. The flavor was out-of-this-world, much more complex than what one finds at Shalimar. As one reviewer wrote below, all the dishes at Lahore Karahi are something of an art -- not simple, but very complex and balanced. The paneer (cheese) in this dish was definitely homemade and quite different from any other paneer I have tasted -- it had almost a crisp exterior but was butter soft, almost melted inside. Imagine well-roasted marshmallows. That was the texture.\n\nThe bangan bharta was also incredible. I usually find bangan bharta to be one of the so-so dishes at Indian/Pakistani restaurants -- always good, but never something I am dying to eat. This was different. This was good enough that one might just come to Lahore Karahi for this single dish.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was the disappointment of the bunch. It was great, certainly better than at Chutney and Naan'n'Curry (like it is at these restaurants, the CTM was cream-based at Lahore Karahi), but it was not orgasmic-kiss-the-floor-take-a-bath-in-it-good like at Shalimar. It was much more normal and non-special. Still excellent, though.\n\nThe naan came very heavily buttered -- tasted great, but clearly some of my order instructions were lost in the kitchen!\n\nThe chai was also quite good (and free). It was spiced so as to have a  much more interesting and flower-like flavor than the chai of Shalimar, N'n'C or Chutney.\n\nAfter paying, on my way out, the chef and server INSISTED that I try their rice pudding, which was incredible. They dished it out for me on the house and watched me eat it with glee. It was like white grout (for laying bricks). Incredible. What gracious hosts!\n\nOverall this place is excellent, incredible, and I would return to have any one of the dishes I ordered (except maybe the chicken tikka masala) -- I would also return just to see the gracious smile of the chef and the server. So kind.\n\nLahore Karahi is an excellent place with which to supplement Shalimar, and will surely become part of my weekly restaurant regimen. It's not better than Shalimar but certainly not worse. Just different. Each dish is so good and so different from Shalimar that my mood will determine which place I visit!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-08-06"}, {"excerpts": ["1 Plain Naan\n", "1 Aluu Paratha (Potato)\n1 Onion Kulcha (Onion Bread) - It's cooked but the onions inside are still raw.

Each lamb piece is the size of my pinky finger. \n\nThe Saag Paneer was bland yet spicy at the same time, an odd combination that left the same bad taste in my mouth as trickle-down economics. Saag Paneer is supposed to have this explosive, orgasmically spiced creamy flavor mixed with the mild subtlety of cheese. This Saag Paneer lacked most of those qualities. \n\nSome may seriously disagree with my review, but that's because they're not acquainted with a) the Old Lahore or b) good Indian/Pakistani food. This new chef is merely throwing things into a pan without understanding how the ingredients complement each other (so he doesn't know how to control each ingredient).

The lamb korma was tender, almost like cutting through butter and a little gamey which I was all too impressed with but that's why I ordered chicken vindaloo. The naan and kulcha was hot, fluffy and complimented the spices in the vindaloo well. We spoiled our appetite by eating bread before coming to the restaurant so we had to wrap up the food but that didn't stop us from ordering dessert.\n\nWe split a kheer and honest to God, it was the first decent kheer I've ever had in San Francisco during the 2+ years here. I'm a big fan of rice pudding and this was real rice pudding that almost looked green! There was so much pistachio and just enough milk that it was a thick pudding that just exploded with flavor. Usually, Indian restaurants do the opposite where you have to search for the pistachio and it's swimming in a pool of milk but they don't cut corners here and I really do appreciate that. \n\nThe owner was so nice that he even shared his homemade ice cream with it. I have no idea what was in it really but it was thick, hardly melted and had thick pieces of pistachio, mango and all kinds of other bits of yum. It was a difficult task to keep eating after the sensation to pop open a button happened, but I kept pushing onward because genuine warm hospitality like that is hard to come by. \n\nI even noticed the server turned the lights on brighter after taking note of me looking up at all the light bulbs in the center of the restaurant.

I patiently waited & shivered at the entry for a few minutes.  I noticed many happy & smile-y faces.  I watched Guddu performing his magic in the kitchen (Yeah, I could do some dish washing/licking in there).    Within seconds I was warmed up.  I was then seated at the table next to the door (it was a little cold there, and I waited a bit, but it made the end result all the more better).\n\nThe server was very apologetic about the wait.  As I waited, I did notice some useful info--they are applying for their liquor license so they can serve beer and wine.  They also received an \"A\" grade for cleanliness.\n\nI went for a standard (Chicken Tikka Masala) and Garlic Naan.

THIS.  WAS. THE.  BEST.  NAAN.  I'VE.  EVER.  HAD!  Oh man, it's been a few weeks, but I still have dreams about the flavor & texture of it.  \n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was more subtle.  The taste didn't hit you quite in the face as the garlic naan.  But y'know, that's what I liked about it.  \n\nIt was like a slow and quiet orchestral piece.  It builds.  The way my taste buds soaked it in was an experience in that all of my little taste buds had a party with every bite.  The crescendo for the party was at the end.

This is by no means the only possible methodology, nor the most efficient one in every case; it's merely an example of the sort of thing I'm talking about.\n\nFurthermore, the benefits of adopting one of these efficient service methodologies seem clear: increased customer throughput, higher accuracy in fulfilling orders, quicker service, etc. Even if you don't give a care about customer satisfaction, the sheer economic logic of increasing customer throughput seems to demand that you adopt one of these time-tested methodologies.\n\nI mention all this, because as soon as you walk into Lahore Karahi it is apparent that they have closely scrutinized the book of well-established customer service methodologies, stroked their metaphorical chin thoroughly for a few seconds, and then promptly tossed the book over their shoulder with a dismissive, \"Naaaaah, we don't need that.\"\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is how it's supposed to go at Lahore Karahi:\n\n- Walk in, grab your own menu, and seat yourself.\n- Decide on what you want.\n- Walk up to the counter and write down on your ticket what you'd like to order. (!)\n- Hand this ticket to someone working behind the counter and sit back down.\n- After some indeterminate period of time, someone will walk over to you with your food.\n- When you are done eating, you go up to the counter, whereupon someone there will know what you ordered and how much to charge you. You pay and are done.\n\nIt is entirely mysterious how they are supposed to know who you are and what you ordered.\n\nIt is considerably less mysterious once you consider that they appear to get it wrong a lot of the time.\n\nAnd this, THIS is what gets my goat. This is the whole point of this ridiculous essay I've written. Concretely, it's because I ordered a garlic naan and did not get it. Abstractly, it's because I'm an engineer, and it's my job to obsess over things like efficiency and fault-tolerance. This is my trade; it's how my brain works. I simply cannot believe that Lahore Karahi's byzantine order fulfillment methodology is the most effective possible solution. And this fact saddens me, and it hurts me inside.\n\nHeck, if this system were *practical* at the expense of pure efficiency, I would be okay with that. Maybe the most theoretically efficient system is weird and difficult to explain and impossible to get people to participate in. But the thing is: so is Lahore Karahi's system! I mean, who the heck has ever written down their own order on the order ticket? How is that a normal thing at all in California? How is anyone supposed to know how to do this a priori?\n\nSo you get the worst of both worlds: a system that regularly gets people's orders wrong, yet still burdens the customer with a weird learning curve.\n\nAnyway, that it. That's all I've got. Maybe I'm being a jerky jerk McJerkface for writing this idiotically long and ranty review. Maybe I'm just a close-minded dummy who perceives everything different as being weird and terrible. Maybe I just need to relax, chill out, and recognize that sometimes, occasionally, stuff ain't perfect.\n\nOr maybe everyone needs to just recognize that I'm right about everything, all the time, forever.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-10-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The tikka masala and garlic naan were very tasty!

The fact of the matter is that, more often than not, veg dishes at many Punjabi joints here well... suck. That the non-veg dishes never quite measure up to my expectations either--well I figure, better to just cut my losses. \n\nWhat's missing exactly? Some kind of weltanschauung--a totality of experience--encompassing the things we love and the art to express it? \n\nDifficult to imagine in a status obsessed, foodie-ville like SF, but opulence and cost have nothing to do with it. Some of my most memorable meals in the subcontinent were for less than a dollar... \n\nFor example, in Old Delhi, Ustad Moinuddin's seekh kababs, made at a tiny street-side charcoal brazier on a congested side lane down from the old haveli of the great Urdu poet Ghalib, are probably the best I've ever had (or will have). While President Clinton can shell out 25 USD for a plate at Bukhara, I'm happy to know that a cycle-rickshaw-wallah can get equal (or better) ones at 4 Rs (10 cents) a pop (this was after a 1 Rs price hike a few years ago). Ustad Moinuddin-ji could easily charge double or triple, but I think that it's not just about money, but about art, along with an obstinate refusal to compromise. \n\n***\n\n\n\nTHE REVIEW:\n\nFor now Lahore Karahi will be my go to place for Punjabi khanna. This is the first place I've been to in the Bay Area where both the non-veg and veg items were done equally well. The food is honest, straightforward--reflecting something of the cook's dedication and skill. Definitely not trying to ingratiate itself to local tastes. While inexpensive, (like nita m. said below) if you choose well, you can get some amazing food.\n\nThe dishes:\n\n* Butter Chicken\n* Palak Paneer\n* Dal Makhani\n* Aloo Paratha\n* Garlic Naan\n* Tandoori Roti\n* Raita\n\nMy measure of a good Punjabi restaurant is how well they make their dal and tandoori rotis. While a North Indian staple, for most restaurants here they are an afterthought. What's more telling about a place is not the specials, but their approach to the basics. To me a flavorless dal, or mediocre tandoori roti reflects a basic lack of skill or respect for the food.  And a shame really, because a good plate of dal accompanied by chawal (rice) or a simple tandoori roti, is to me, basic comfort food.\n\nZulfiqar, the chef and owner in the kitchen, has a touch. The food actually has personality. The tandoori roti was decent, not some kind of dry cracker, and the dal? Flavorful.\n\nButter chicken is really what CTM aspires to be. The latter being merely its pale, poultry shadow. LK's version was a little heavy on the fenugreek and onion for my tastes and lacked a hint of sweetness, but was decent. But what really stood out was the palak paneer. \n\nCompared to other places the flavors were distinct and had depth. The paneer was fried to a golden color with brown edges, giving it a nice firm texture. \n\nAs far as the bread goes, it's okay. The aloo paratha was decent, better than the one that I had at Kabana. The sprinkle of sesame seeds on the garlic naan is a nice touch. Though personally, I prefer my naan to be a little thicker, more pillowy (can't say I've found good naan outside of Old Delhi, honestly). And the fact that they can make tandoori roti already speaks volumes. \n\nThe only thing that kind of sucked was the raita. While they may make their own yogurt at the restaurant--which is great--the raita was way too tart, with a bit of a 'carbonated' taste from being overly fermented.\n\nSans hipsters, all-in-all, LK could be a neighborhood joint in Delhi or Lahore.

He sank it in his water glass, cleaned it off and passed it around the table.  Sure enough - it was a rock.  We banged it against the table...scratched the table with it in fact.   And then we scratched our heads.  Maybe it was a spicy rock? A spice rock?  A cinna-pebble? We debated how such a pebble could get into the vindaloo, and then debated some more whether to tell the chef-owner when paying.  Jerry decided he should.  The owner just kinda looked at it for a bit.  Then he picked it up and rolled it between his fingers.  The smile never left his face.  I felt awkward.

Upon entering, we were promptly seated and given our drinks. We got fish tikka masala, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken leg, some garlic naan and basmati rice. \n\nThe fish tikka masala is beyond superb. Chilean sea bass cooked in a buttery tikka masala sauce that has a great depth of flavors. Unlike most places where the TM sauce is very smooth and creamy (sometimes almost too creamy), Lahore's version is chunkier, has more texture to it (I think there were nuts in the sauce...or some other crunchy thing) and has a lot more flavor. Some people prefer their tikka masala smooth and creamy -- I was one of those -- but I'm now a convert for the chunkier and more flavorful sauce that Lahore makes. \n\nThe chicken biryani is also good. We asked for it spicy though, which is a little too spicy for me. I must admit that I have a low tolerance level for anything hot, so I think I downed two cups of water for the small portion of biryani that I tasted. \n\nThe tandoori chicken is yum-o as well. For $3, you get a tandoori chicken thigh/leg on a big plate of grilled veggies. It's moist, delicious and just has the right amount of kick to it.\n\nThe garlic naan is goooood. A warning though, they take their garlic seriously here, so if you're a faux or a semi garlic lover, I suggest going for the regular. The garlic and cilantro is just ooozing from the naan and since I love both, I was in naan heaven after having some. \n\nOh and of course, forget about parking when you go here. Try walking instead. I know, it's the Tenderloin, but it's a short little walk from Union Square, the muni, bart, so getting here is no problemo at all. \n\nJust clutch that purse to your chest, have 911 already dialed on your cellphone -- you just need to press the call button -- bring that pepper spray and you're good to go.

First impressions were quite dismal.  For starters, It was a struggle convincing my date to walk through the questionable neighborhood but once we entered what appeared to be a converted soup kitchen, I thought she was going to have a panic attack.\n\nThe menu was appealing however and the aromas from the open kitchen were quite tantalizing.  Once the food arrived (which was surprisingly fast considering other's experiences),  I was drawn to the meal and our surroundings disappeared.   We had modest appetites and regrettably only ordered two main dishes.  The Chicken Korma was mild and inviting but the Lamb Biryani stole the show.  With a requested \"medium\" spiciness, the flavors were heightened and not overwhelming.  The rice was light and the lamb was not too.... lamby?.  The garlic Naan was outstanding but the lightly roasted garlic with butter was a little much for my companion.  She has very light tastes so we ordered some plain Naan too but upon its arrival she exclaimed \"oh, it's so greasy\".\n\nI think our host was already a bit irked with us at this point.  My date's questions about certain dishes while ordering were met with some confusion and impatience.  There was a dual language barrier going on so I let it go at the time.  But, the greasy Naan comment seemed to truly offend him.  He grabbed a paper napkin and very aggressively dabbed away the grease right in front of her face.

I looked around to see four tables that still had dirty dishes...all this was a huge turn-off, but we decided to stay anyway since the reviews were so good. The place is small, and only a few tables were taken, so why the waiter/buss boy was so damn slow in doing his work was beyond me. \n\nIt was irritating to see him walk around, answering his phone every few minutes while doing everything in slow-mo.

So from here on you will be seeing more from me. I tend to visit a new restaurant every weekend and i am a big fan of food\\cooking myself.\n\nMy first ever review and sorry that it has to be a negative one. But here is why:\n\nThis is what i feel when i follow a Yelp review:\n\nWhen it comes to food, there is a difference between good tasting food and ORIGINAL tasting food. \nYelp reviewers can agree on good tasting food, but not on the later. For example, I have found myself loving certain\nChinese &Mediterranean restaurants which are detested by my Chinese &Mediterranean friends. Reason: I liked how the \nfood at these places tasted, but had no exact idea as to how they were supposed to taste. It is like going to a sushi \nplace and enjoying a sushi with cooked fish(Might be exaggerating a bit :-) ). \n\n\nLahore Karahi will probably fit the former(In my case not even that). Here are reasons why:\n\nMy order:\n\n1)Sheek Kebab\n2)Lamb Biryani\n3)Garlic Naan\n4)Butter Chicken\n\nIn this case, me being from that part of the world(Indian& Pakistan) and being an avid food lover, I know how each of the above should taste like, or how each \nof the above taste in the best restaurants, cooked by the best chefs in that part of the world. let me explain how\nit should have been cooked and how it should have tasted, and how it actually did.\n\n1) Sheek Kebab: Ground lamb kebabs which when pulled out of the tandoor(grill), should never be overcooked.\nWhen served, the meat is tender and juicy and is still cooking from the heat. at Lahori: burnt on the outside, really\ndry meat, overcooked. spices were not bad.\n\n2)Lamb Biryani: usually cooked in a big pot\\vessel with alternate layers of \nrice and meat(Slow cooked for a long time and simmered and when served, the layers are mixed and a serving portion is taken out of the big \npot/vessel). At Lahori: rice and meat mixed together in a frying pan(I saw him do this!).\n\n3) Garlic Naan: Naan usually fluffy and super soft bread with garlic and cilantro pretty much melting on top with the heat of the Naan.\nAt Lahori: dry bread, garlic not fresh.\n\n4) Butter chicken: Creamy sauce, with butter floating on top with super soft chicken pieces. At lahori: Not creamy at all, \nbut rather like a paste of onions and tomatoes. the texture was so that i could feel the onions and tomatoes in my mouth.\nthe color which should be bright red or orange is just red. can barely taste the fresh butter. \n\nA lot of you might be thinking if should expect all this in a small restaurant in tenderloin. But as a matter of fact, Every good\\well known\nstreet side restaurant in that part of Indian/Pakistan serve the above dishes just as explained above.\n\nReasons why my 2 stars: The use of spices were pretty decent .But failed in all other aspects (texture, the way it is \ncooked, served, size, taste) . The service was friendly and good.\n\nAlso to note, probably a reason why this place gets great reviews, is the service part. The old man serving tends to do a great job\nin hyping up the restaurant. I hear him say things like \"No one cooks this dish as good as we do\" and it seems to be working with the\ncustomers as well. i don't rate restaurants on decor unless it fits that category.

But now, after this year these things will always be just one degree of separation for me.\n\nWe came here for Christmas eve. It was pretty busy around 8pm. You order up front, seat yourself, and pay at the end when you're finished with your meal. \n\nThe unique thing about Lahore Karahi is all the self service which I've never really had experience with. There is unlimited hot chai tea, wine glasses, water jugs in the refrigerator all DIY. I actually kinda liked it, you don't have to wait around for a server for simple requests at this casual dining spot. \n\nThe food did take kind of long to come but I think the kitchen is small and everything is so fresh, it takes a bit and it's definitely worth the wait. I suppose don't come when you're in a rush and want to be in and out quickly. \n\nWe started off with an order of samosa. It's REALLY simple. Not too many spices, no peas. This is a very basic samosa that gets the job done. I needed some extra salt. Their tamarind sauce is a bit too watery, but the flavor is still good. The cilantro/mint one was spot on. For the main meal, my partner ordered the chicken boti tikka. This was fantastic -- 4 huge pieces of tender and moist chicken in a beautiful bright red color and sauteed onions with lime on a skillet. It doesn't come with a sauce for dipping if you get naan, so be mindful of that. \n\nI ordered the chicken tikka masala which I really did enjoy, but the flavors are little bit muted compared to a great chicken tikka. Still though, with the naan and gravy I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I have to say the naan at Lahore Karahi is off the charts. I might even go so far as to say this is the one of the best, if not the best naan I've ever had. It was super fresh, sooooo soft and chewy and delicious.

I liked the feel of the place and how Bollywood movies were playing in the background. You can tell this restaurant is part of the fabric of our fair city. For example, a customer came back and said something in an Pakistani dialect - perhaps she forgot to tip - and Guddhu smiled and waved a \"no problem\" and she thanked him.\n\nIt's not like Shalimar has a much better health score (86 and I've seen cockroaches there), but I'm still locked into hearing my Indian dishes conducted by Maestro Shalimar.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Sabzi (frozen mixed vegetable mush), paneer w/nuts (cloyingly sweet tomato sauce), and choley (not choley at all, but an assortment of mixed dals.)

Upon entering, we were promptly seated and given our drinks. We got fish tikka masala, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken leg, some garlic naan and basmati rice. \n\nThe fish tikka masala is beyond superb. Chilean sea bass cooked in a buttery tikka masala sauce that has a great depth of flavors. Unlike most places where the TM sauce is very smooth and creamy (sometimes almost too creamy), Lahore's version is chunkier, has more texture to it (I think there were nuts in the sauce...or some other crunchy thing) and has a lot more flavor. Some people prefer their tikka masala smooth and creamy -- I was one of those -- but I'm now a convert for the chunkier and more flavorful sauce that Lahore makes. \n\nThe chicken biryani is also good. We asked for it spicy though, which is a little too spicy for me. I must admit that I have a low tolerance level for anything hot, so I think I downed two cups of water for the small portion of biryani that I tasted. \n\nThe tandoori chicken is yum-o as well. For $3, you get a tandoori chicken thigh/leg on a big plate of grilled veggies. It's moist, delicious and just has the right amount of kick to it.\n\nThe garlic naan is goooood. A warning though, they take their garlic seriously here, so if you're a faux or a semi garlic lover, I suggest going for the regular. The garlic and cilantro is just ooozing from the naan and since I love both, I was in naan heaven after having some. \n\nOh and of course, forget about parking when you go here. Try walking instead.

Also I thought it tasted a little peanut buttery, which is not a flavor commonly found in channas. \n- Aloo Gobhi: This is a dish I would recommend avoiding. It's really oily & doesn't have very good flavor. \n- Garlic Naan: Lahore puts garlic and a spice rub on their garlic naan, and it's amazing.

Thankfully we weren't starving so we didn't mind waiting. I picked up some beer from a nearby market and we drank and waited patiently.\n\nThe lamb arrived and was unlike any vindaloo we had ever had before. It was shreddy and succulent, immersed in a complex and delicious sauce. It was definitely spicy, but was also excellently spiced bursting with a plethora of flavors.\n\nThe bengan bhartha was extremely spicy. Easily the spiciest dish of the night. We were both happy and impressed with the level of spicyness. It's nice to find a place that's not afraid to bring the real heat. The dish was also quite tender and tastey.\n\nThe naan was great. Hot out of the tandoor in all its crispy-chewy glory. The onion kulcha tasted good, too, but I thought it could have used a bit more onion.\n\nLastly, the tandoori fish arrived sizzling on a cast iron hot plate. Flakey and tender chunks of sea bass with nicely charred edges, on a bed of lightly fried onions and lettuce. One bite and I knew it was the best Pakistani-Indian flavored fish dish I had ever laid my mouth upon. \"Wow\", was all I could muster up. The fish was fully flavored with lots of cilantro, coriander seeds, and fresh chilies.\n\nTotally sated I walked up to the front and thanked the chef for all the glorious and amazing food. I asked him what kind of fish was in the tandoori dish and he told me it was seabass. He mentioned that other chefs use salmon or catfish, but that he finds sea bass to be superior in taste. As I'm not a fan of cooked salmon, I totally agreed.\n\nHe offered us some homemade kulfi, but we could not eat anymore, and so told him we would gladly take some home. We wrapped up our leftovers and after paying, the chef gave us an additional complimentary dessert of bread pudding.\n\nLater on that night we delved into the kulfi which was creamy and superb. And yesterday we broke out the leftovers and bread pudding. The leftovers were just as good the next day, and the bread pudding was another winner.\n\nIt's really amazing how much good cheap food there is to be found in the Tenderloin.

Lahore Karahi would now be added to the list of other mediocre Pakistani restaurants in the City.\n\nWell, since I was already there when I learned of this change, I figured I might as well give them a chance and eat something.

I ordered the chef's special Nihari, one of my fav dishes but one that was never on the previous LK menu, as well as the chicken karahi, my LK fav. \n\nThe cons to the new owners are that they're still finding their groove. They don't have service down just yet, they didn't bring us plates or drinks or anything to begin with. The food took a bit longer than expected, especially since most of the tables in the restaurant had already been served, but we could see that they were still trying to move quickly. The food arrived and my primary disappointment was the portion sizes -- smaller than most restaurants. If the owners are reading this, take my word of advice on the service and portions -- you'll need to step it up to restaurant standard, this isn't your dining room at home. My second disappointment was that although the main entrees arrived, there was no naan in sight. We silently waiting a few mins but our food was getting cold and we still had no naan. We politely asked the owner and he rushed an order and sent over naan one by one as soon as he could and we began eating.\n\nNow you must wonder, if I have so many suggestions and disappointments thusfar, then why the 4 stars? Well, because to my dismay and against all expectations, the food was still good.

The place was pretty empty and we were seated on the big table in the middle, even though there were only two of us. Next to a us was a little table in the corner full of dirty dishes. I looked around to see four tables that still had dirty dishes...all this was a huge turn-off, but we decided to stay anyway since the reviews were so good. The place is small, and only a few tables were taken, so why the waiter/buss boy was so damn slow in doing his work was beyond me. \n\nIt was irritating to see him walk around, answering his phone every few minutes while doing everything in slow-mo. I asked for a straw...he actually looked around for one when there was a container full sitting in a prominent place next to the drink glasses. Anyone who's been to this place knows how tiny it is...I'd never been there, but still, I knew where the straws were! Near the entrance, somebody was peeling potatoes and onions on a small table. It sure didn't add to the already crappy ambiance.\n\nThe food was not so great, either. We ordered vegetable pakoras which were overdone. The butter chicken had a weird consistency and tasted nothing like any butter chicken I've ever had. The chicken karahi was nicely spicy, but all you could taste was dry chicken and green chillies. The garlic naan was ok, but the regular naan was really good. Mango lassi was watered down and they had no ice for our Cokes.\n\nNeedless to say, dinner sucked. The kitchen was dirty, the owner kept coming and going indoors and out...he actually met a friend at the front door and played with her dog...eeew!

The fact of the matter is that, more often than not, veg dishes at many Punjabi joints here well... suck. That the non-veg dishes never quite measure up to my expectations either--well I figure, better to just cut my losses. \n\nWhat's missing exactly? Some kind of weltanschauung--a totality of experience--encompassing the things we love and the art to express it? \n\nDifficult to imagine in a status obsessed, foodie-ville like SF, but opulence and cost have nothing to do with it. Some of my most memorable meals in the subcontinent were for less than a dollar... \n\nFor example, in Old Delhi, Ustad Moinuddin's seekh kababs, made at a tiny street-side charcoal brazier on a congested side lane down from the old haveli of the great Urdu poet Ghalib, are probably the best I've ever had (or will have). While President Clinton can shell out 25 USD for a plate at Bukhara, I'm happy to know that a cycle-rickshaw-wallah can get equal (or better) ones at 4 Rs (10 cents) a pop (this was after a 1 Rs price hike a few years ago). Ustad Moinuddin-ji could easily charge double or triple, but I think that it's not just about money, but about art, along with an obstinate refusal to compromise. \n\n***\n\n\n\nTHE REVIEW:\n\nFor now Lahore Karahi will be my go to place for Punjabi khanna. This is the first place I've been to in the Bay Area where both the non-veg and veg items were done equally well. The food is honest, straightforward--reflecting something of the cook's dedication and skill. Definitely not trying to ingratiate itself to local tastes. While inexpensive, (like nita m. said below) if you choose well, you can get some amazing food.\n\nThe dishes:\n\n* Butter Chicken\n* Palak Paneer\n* Dal Makhani\n* Aloo Paratha\n* Garlic Naan\n* Tandoori Roti\n* Raita\n\nMy measure of a good Punjabi restaurant is how well they make their dal and tandoori rotis. While a North Indian staple, for most restaurants here they are an afterthought. What's more telling about a place is not the specials, but their approach to the basics. To me a flavorless dal, or mediocre tandoori roti reflects a basic lack of skill or respect for the food.  And a shame really, because a good plate of dal accompanied by chawal (rice) or a simple tandoori roti, is to me, basic comfort food.\n\nZulfiqar, the chef and owner in the kitchen, has a touch. The food actually has personality. The tandoori roti was decent, not some kind of dry cracker, and the dal? Flavorful.\n\nButter chicken is really what CTM aspires to be. The latter being merely its pale, poultry shadow. LK's version was a little heavy on the fenugreek and onion for my tastes and lacked a hint of sweetness, but was decent. But what really stood out was the palak paneer. \n\nCompared to other places the flavors were distinct and had depth. The paneer was fried to a golden color with brown edges, giving it a nice firm texture. \n\nAs far as the bread goes, it's okay. The aloo paratha was decent, better than the one that I had at Kabana. The sprinkle of sesame seeds on the garlic naan is a nice touch. Though personally, I prefer my naan to be a little thicker, more pillowy (can't say I've found good naan outside of Old Delhi, honestly). And the fact that they can make tandoori roti already speaks volumes. \n\nThe only thing that kind of sucked was the raita. While they may make their own yogurt at the restaurant--which is great--the raita was way too tart, with a bit of a 'carbonated' taste from being overly fermented.\n\nSans hipsters, all-in-all, LK could be a neighborhood joint in Delhi or Lahore. Like some other reviewers said, if you're missing real Punjabi food, I recommend this place.\n\n\nService was friendly, prompt and good. \n\nCleanliness-wise: during our wait for a table, a roach did double duty as a greeter on a stack of Urdu newspapers by the entrance.

The problem I had with this place was the wait time.\n\nThis place is tiny but I think what makes it worse is that there are only two guys working the place, at least there were when I ate there for lunch on a weekday. My party ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table and then about 20 more for our dishes. One of us didn't get his tandoori until we had finished all of the other dishes. \n\nI'm not familiar with Indian food, having only eaten it a handful of times in my life, but it was actually OK, especially the curries. But the tandoori chicken was only OK, probably because it was rushed (I think the super-busy cook forgot until the last minute). \n\nAnd yes, the bathroom is scary. Didn't see any roaches but was freaked by the dirty broom stowed away alongside the toilet and the lack of proper toilet paper (they only had a large roll of crisp, paper towels). \n\nIf it weren't for the fact that someone else paid for my meal, I wouldn't have gone here. And what's more, I went here as part of a 'welcome' meal-- couldn't have been less welcoming but I knew it wasn't the fault or the intention of the people who took me out. I wanted Indian food but wasn't familiar with the restaurants in the area so I left it up to someone else to pick (and yes, I realize Pakistani food is different but I specifically said I wanted to eat Indian and this is where I was brought-- I'm not implying that Pakistani and Indian are \"all the same\").

If you plan on popping in during SF-dinner-rush-hour, (6-8pm) hoping to order-and-eat in a span of two, even three hours... well... lol. Just, lol. \n\nThe problem, my group realized, during our two-plus-hour dining experience, is that there is only one, max two chefs, cooking each order, lovingly, one at a time, be it rush hour or not. So the creamy, stewy daal makhany you ordered? Yeah, it's going to take at least 20 minutes on top of the time it takes Chef Guddu to make everything else. \n\nNot realizing this, my group of four crowded in at 7:30, wrote down our order via the new-fangled self-service process, watched the tab slip into Guddu's pocket, and sat down to wait. And wait. And wait. And then wait some more. When, 45 minutes later, the single waiter hurried out with an urn of hot chai, everyone made a mad beeline for it, hoping to refuel their starved bodies with the sticky, hot concoction of caffeine, milk and sugar. It was gone within 10 minutes, and would not be replenished.\n\nAn hour and 15 minutes later, we went to check on our meal ticket, which was still lying, crinkled and forgotten, in Guddu's pocket. Realizing this, he pulled it out, chuckling apologetically, and placed it in front of all the other meal tickets, which were being arbitrarily assembled and sent out. 30 minutes after that, we flagged down the harried waiter, who asked if we wanted some naan in the meanwhile. We did, and it came out buttery and hot, within five minutes. Having made this awesome discovery (that naan is the only thing that will come out in under five minutes) we called for more, and when we were finally satiated with the puffy rounds of bread, the dishes started coming out, (at this point, past the two hour mark) staggered, one by one. \n\nThe food wafted up to our noses in fragrant curls of steam, and every bite of my chicken tikka masala was tender, silken and spicy. I enjoyed it greatly, despite the fact that I didn't order chicken tikka masala-- I ordered butter chicken, but whatever-- I really didn't want to wait another hour for that to come around. The kabobs were deliciously smoky, and the aloo paratha yielded comforting, giant mouthfuls of spiced potato and fresh cilantro. \n\nAt 9pm, the atmosphere crackled with the polar swing of ravenous irritation and silent content. Merry beer drinkers gave way into irascible finger-tappers. A displeased Indian family dissolved into smiles when their tandoori fish finally made it to their corner table. \n\nAll said, it would probably be easier to know a Pakistani mama who can make similarly delicious food for you, but if that isn't obtainable... Come full so that you can digest your food during the two-hour wait and then be hungry enough to eat again, or just come really late. 9:45pm should do the trick.

The owner just kinda looked at it for a bit.  Then he picked it up and rolled it between his fingers.  The smile never left his face.  I felt awkward.

I tend to visit a new restaurant every weekend and i am a big fan of food\\cooking myself.\n\nMy first ever review and sorry that it has to be a negative one. But here is why:\n\nThis is what i feel when i follow a Yelp review:\n\nWhen it comes to food, there is a difference between good tasting food and ORIGINAL tasting food. \nYelp reviewers can agree on good tasting food, but not on the later. For example, I have found myself loving certain\nChinese &Mediterranean restaurants which are detested by my Chinese &Mediterranean friends. Reason: I liked how the \nfood at these places tasted, but had no exact idea as to how they were supposed to taste. It is like going to a sushi \nplace and enjoying a sushi with cooked fish(Might be exaggerating a bit :-) ). \n\n\nLahore Karahi will probably fit the former(In my case not even that). Here are reasons why:\n\nMy order:\n\n1)Sheek Kebab\n2)Lamb Biryani\n3)Garlic Naan\n4)Butter Chicken\n\nIn this case, me being from that part of the world(Indian& Pakistan) and being an avid food lover, I know how each of the above should taste like, or how each \nof the above taste in the best restaurants, cooked by the best chefs in that part of the world. let me explain how\nit should have been cooked and how it should have tasted, and how it actually did.\n\n1) Sheek Kebab: Ground lamb kebabs which when pulled out of the tandoor(grill), should never be overcooked.\nWhen served, the meat is tender and juicy and is still cooking from the heat. at Lahori: burnt on the outside, really\ndry meat, overcooked. spices were not bad.\n\n2)Lamb Biryani: usually cooked in a big pot\\vessel with alternate layers of \nrice and meat(Slow cooked for a long time and simmered and when served, the layers are mixed and a serving portion is taken out of the big \npot/vessel). At Lahori: rice and meat mixed together in a frying pan(I saw him do this!).\n\n3) Garlic Naan: Naan usually fluffy and super soft bread with garlic and cilantro pretty much melting on top with the heat of the Naan.\nAt Lahori: dry bread, garlic not fresh.\n\n4) Butter chicken: Creamy sauce, with butter floating on top with super soft chicken pieces. At lahori: Not creamy at all, \nbut rather like a paste of onions and tomatoes. the texture was so that i could feel the onions and tomatoes in my mouth.\nthe color which should be bright red or orange is just red. can barely taste the fresh butter. \n\nA lot of you might be thinking if should expect all this in a small restaurant in tenderloin. But as a matter of fact, Every good\\well known\nstreet side restaurant in that part of Indian/Pakistan serve the above dishes just as explained above.\n\nReasons why my 2 stars: The use of spices were pretty decent .But failed in all other aspects (texture, the way it is \ncooked, served, size, taste) . The service was friendly and good.\n\nAlso to note, probably a reason why this place gets great reviews, is the service part. The old man serving tends to do a great job\nin hyping up the restaurant. I hear him say things like \"No one cooks this dish as good as we do\" and it seems to be working with the\ncustomers as well. i don't rate restaurants on decor unless it fits that category. The decor in this place seems to be good enough for this\nplace. \n\nAs it is my first one, i hope you enjoyed it and also be easy on me!", "rating": 2, "date": "2007-10-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Butter chicken was good, but not as good as the eggplant (can't remember if it was the aloo bengan or the bengan bhartiia).

All of the dishes I've had are richly spiced and really nicely put together, especially for $7 or $8. Even old standbys are extra tasty here, and they aren't greasy which can be the downfall of some cheap South Asian restaurants.\n\nI've had the well loved fish curry, and really liked it, the the potato/cauliflower aloo gobhi (extra interesting here and absolutely delicious with what can be relatively bland ingredients) and the butter chicken.

It's a small room and one person should be able to cover it even when busy.\n\nLast night, 9/12/09,  was just dreadful. The one waiter was scattered and couldn't seem to figure out that bringing more than one dish from the kitchen at a time would be more efficient and less annoying to the patrons. He would go to the kitchen, get one thing, and then go back and get another and take it to the same table. Crazy. \n\nIt took 30 minutes for our food to come which seems very long in a restaurant of this sort. People who sat down after us got their food before us, which is always irritating, moreso when you're trying to go to a movie up the street. The waiter was also packaging to go orders, so it's not entirely his fault, but he clearly had no idea what he was doing. \n\nWhen the first dish finally came, we reminded him to bring us the bread, rice and mixed pickle we ordered, which he brought ON THREE SEPARATE TRIPS from the kitchen, even though it's either pre-made (pickle) or sitting there waiting to be dished up (bread and rice).\n\nJust crazy. it would make me hesitate to go back, particularly if I was in a hurry, like last night.

So do yourself a favor and do not come here with a group of 10 people during lunch.  You can imagine how long it took to cook dishes for our table plus the other tables with only 1 cook and 2 burners.

Just FYI.\n\nThe Bengan Bartha was really smooth and smoky.  Not too oily.  I would recommend this.  While I was waiting for my Tandoori Fish I had the opportunity to try the Chicken Biryani (good) and Chicken (korma).  The naan was pretty good but not amazing like I was expecting.

And the only reason I had the courage to go (since it was in the tenderloin) was because I had a coupon from the Entertainment book (xmas gift). So I gathered 3 other friends and went. \n\nWow - it was really good! We had plain and afghani naan, lamb biryani, karahi chicken, prawn curry. Each dish was brought out separately, and not necessarily in order. Meaning, the naan arrived with nothing else at first. I asked the owner/chef and he responded that one must wait because everything is made fresh. Not exactly the answer I was looking for but ok. And I wasn't disappointed when he and his assistant (it was a 2-man operation) came with the curries. The sauces were flavorful, hot, and fresh. \n\nIf you read my other review, you'll know I'm not a lamb fan, but my 2 other friends devored the biryani. Seems like a good sign. My only disappointment was the Afghani naan. I was thinking it would be more like this other sweet naan I was in search of, but this reminded me more of a fruitcake naan. Same colors and odd taste. But hey, what do I know.\n\nI'd definitely go back, without fear nor coupons (the bill was $40 for FOUR people with a few non alcoholic drinks + tip). Be adventurous and go! Just remember to be patient or else you'll be reprimanded too.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-12-07"}], "fish korma": [], "prawn vegi korma": []}
