My brother ordered a couple of tacos ($2.50 each), while I had a watermelon aguas frescas and the Milanesa (breaded chicken) plate ($6.75), that comes with rice and beans (choose: pinto, refried, or black beans). My food really hit the spot, the chicken was hot and delicious. Based on that item alone I would give them 4 stars. But I'll reserve that extra star until I try other menu items.\n\nI tasted a bite of the fish taco, it's alright but not as good as my chicken Milanesa, they both used the same fried batter. Note that they put rice on their tacos (most taquerias don't do that), just a comment, not a criticism. I saw a handwritten sign indicating that Menudo (tripe stew) was available, but other than that the menu is basic and won't scare off most Americans (I have a preference for more authentic Mexican menus that include internal organs, etc.).\n\nI think that they use a ready made guacamole mix (more watery, uniform olive green color), which is not as good as freshly made guacamole. I love avocados, so I notice this type of little details. But flavor was still good. And the side container of \"salsa\" for the tortilla chips, was a liquid instead of the typical fresh chopped coarse salsa.\n\nThey made a minor error (more items than what I had ordered) when they charged my credit card, but fixed it quickly afterwards by just giving me the difference in cash back.\n\nOn the plus side, they have a very clean bathroom, and a large dining room (enter by right side of cashier) as well as several outdoor umbrella covered tables. The service was pleasant.\n\nSF Weekly - Best of San Francisco article:\nhttp://www.sfweekly.com/bestof/2008/award/best-fish-taco-1032593/\n\nRegarding SF Weekly's \"Best of SF\" claim of best fish tacos: No way! Don't get me wrong, the tacos are good, but definitely not the best. In my opinion, both Nick's Crispy Tacos and Underdogs Taco Shop (see my review about long wait times) make better fried fish (baja-style) tacos. So what makes them better at those 2 places? The quality of the fresh flaky and flavorful fried fish fillet (x2 size). And the option to add really good guacamole (\"Nick's way\"). I've yet to try Tacubaya's version over in Berkeley.\n\nOther places that also sell fried fish (baja-style) tacos: Pacific Catch, Rubio's, Baja Fresh, Del Taco, etc. - decide on your own which ones u like or dislike.\n\nFor traditional tacos (no fried fish) my favorite is Taqueria Cancun ($2.30 each - 3 store locations).\n\nPics of the food:\n\n1 beef + 2 fish tacos:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2y2lTn53XJCGFh8lkXJ8OA?select=Qb9kFXUKOEfnbcHuTfn4mw\n\nchicken Milanesa plate:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2y2lTn53XJCGFh8lkXJ8OA?select=fCE_pQ08xjoFL5gMRWsV4Q", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-10-27"}], "house soup": []}
