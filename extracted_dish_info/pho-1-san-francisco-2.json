I had sworn off this restaurant after a bad experience last December, but when a past acquaintance spotted me recently and called out my name then suggested we grab lunch at this restaurant I was more than happy to oblige.\n\nOkay so maybe I was a bit over dramatic in my last update.  A restaurant is allowed to have one bad dish.  Am I right?  Fine.  With that said don't ever order the chicken curry with rice.  Trust me on that.  My old friend told me she liked this restaurant and had eaten here several times in the past.  She said she especially enjoyed the fresh fruit drinks the kitchen whirls up.\n\nThe service was excellent as usual.  The warm greeting, the menus in our hands, the cups of hot tea on our table our waitress returned in minutes to take our order.  My friend couldn't decide between the pho or the bun, so I suggested we order one of each and share them.  We had a large Pho Tai Chin Nam (well-done beef and rare beef noodle soup) and the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (grilled BBQ pork and imperial roll vermicelli).  She ordered some frou-frou looking fruit drink that I didn't catch the name of.  I think it was their mango puree.\n\nThe food was on our table within minutes.  My friend thought it was odd that I asked to take a photo of each dish.  She inquired whether I worked for the health department or for a rival restaurant.  She had no idea what Yelp was as my explanation had her seemingly puzzled.  Why not just eat the food?  Why do you write about it too?  \n\nHere's what we got.  The Pho (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/xScGXSwZXXkhwlc-cJc1pw/l) and the Bun (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/BYC-txiCFmN0qp7_IlQ-fA/l) came out in big, deep round bowls.  My friend suggested the portions seemed larger than when she dined alone.  I'm not a big fan of raw red onions.  I was so happy to see my friend scoop off most of the rings of red onion and put it into her bowl.  The thin slices of beef in the Pho were generous in portion size and tasted okay.  The medium width rice noodles were abundant and soft, but I detected the sting of MSG in the broth.  There was enough of it to make me switch my attention to the Bun.  I got in under the mound of cold soft rice vermicelli to get to the shredded lettuce, basil, cucumber strips and bean sprouts.  All of the vegetables were fresh and crispy.  The noodles were nice and chewy.  The thinly sliced grilled pork was tender and had a slight sweetness to it.  The imperial roll was good.  I especially liked that in addition to the crushed peanuts and the sauteed green onion, they added some deep fried onion bits to the top of the dish.  I thought the fried onion enhanced the dish quite well.\n\nAs we ate we engaged in small talk seeing what each of us had been up to over the years, and when we finished eating we went through the entire Chinese ritual of fighting to see who pays the bill.  I suggested that although I was all for equality a good male friend never lets a female friend pay for lunch.  She was cool with that, and I got the bill.\n\nAs we exited the restaurant we stood outside and exchanged our contact information.  It was at that time that she reminded me what her name is because she knew I was clueless to that throughout our lunch.  I felt a bit embarrassed that she knew that all along.

Now, granted this place is only a few days old so I'll give it time for them to improve on the service and the taste....but I am still excited to have more variety of food in this neighborhood.  Their specialty....Pho Ga (chicken pho) and Pho Tai stands out when compared to their 20 or so different types of soup base and noodles.  I tried their Bun Bo Hue since I got there late and the ladies were already having their Pho Ga and made me try something else.  \n\nFor their Pho Ga...i'll say it's pretty decent but the broth is a little off, it can use a little bit more seasoning.  As for the Bun Bo Hue, their broth was good. Very filling and very meaty.  I jokingly complained to the owner that it wasnt spicy enough, owner jokingly told me to add more chili sauce, dipshit.  They also have the charbroiled pork with vermicelli and egg rolls that he recommend I try next time I'm there.......yes sir!  The typical vietnamese dessert drinks, grass jelly, three star mix and milkshakes make up the rest of the menu.\n\nNow I know the owner of this place for quite a while.  He was the chef at \"the Window\" and her sister is running the \"little window\" pho place off of Noriega.  I know in due time the broth will taste just right and things will definitely taste great......tastes good now...but will taste great soon.   Will most definitely come back here and try their other dishes.  Service was not up to par yet.....most of the waitresses have A.D.D. and are lost most of the time.  Kinda funny to get the bill when we are in the middle of our meal =)  You can really tell the workers there are inexperience with the vietnamese noodle house atmosphere.\n\n*edit* - 9/24/07 - \nAh...this is more like it!  In less than 2 weeks they have definitely turn the place around.  Service is superbly better and the food tastes good.  Had their Crab Meat in Tomato soup vermicelli and that tasted great.

For some reason, their tai is with cooked and rare steak. Sounds weird, but I just ordered the rare steak. It was not placed on a separate plate, but it was still pink and NEVER went dry or overcooked as it bathed in my noodle soup the whole time. The soup was warm to hot, so it was a bit of a surprise that my beef didn't get all wrinkly and dry. Very high quality beef that was thick and tender. One thing that does bother me a bit is that they don't give out bean sprouts here (just onions & green onions in the soup w/ the jalapeno and lime to the side). Although I ordered the small this time and it looked small, its contents weren't. It took a while for me to finish, and I was pretty full by the time I got done.\n\nThe service was basically like most Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants. Not much service indeed, but pleasant enough. I saw the worker continuously wiping the walls and all.\n\nThis place was clean and neat. They probably tried to go modern with the walls painted green, but didn't quite make it. The dull pinkish red molding/trim absolutely gave the place an Asian feel. The plastic lights on top definitely added to that feel. But they do have some cute decor that reminded me a bit of Penang Garden. Flatscreen tv near the back that plays old school Chinese and Vietnamese music. \n\nI also ordered the papaya salad with beef and it was definitely not the best I've had. The dish looked colorful enough, but almost too colorful. If I hadn't known that I ordered a papaya salad or what a papaya salad was, I would think its some kind of mixed salad (for there was almost the same amount of cabbage as there were papaya and the shredded carrots following). The salad was also mixed with a generous amount of nuts and flaky little crunchy things (never knew what those were called). The 4 shrimp chips were random and again, very Asian. The papaya shreds could've been cut more thoroughly, for lots of it stuck together in a big chunk. There was also no TANG to the dish, when there should be. This was almost a miss, but I managed to finish almost all of it cause I love green papaya!\n\nThey also gave me a free egg custard dessert afterward and it was pretty good. It reminded me of the ones my mom used to buy/make for me when I was a kid. I hope that's not their version of creme brulee though. Ha. Yummy indeed.\n\nPrices - very good. \nPlace - very clean.\nService - like any other Viet/Chinese restaurant.\nFood - noodles are definitely a hit, but not so much the salad.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-11-13"}], "lemon leaf steamed chicken": [], "piece satay beef skewers": [], "chicken meat and intestine noodle soup": [], "chicken vermicelli noodle soup": [], "meat combo rice noodle soup": [], "snail meat rice noodle soup": [], "welldone beef and rare beef noodle soup": [], "beef and beef ball noodle soup": [], "pho bo dac biet": [], "crab meat and tomato with rice noodle": [], "duck and dry bamboo with rice noodle": [], "spicy beef and pork noodle soup": [], "wine sauce oxtail noodle soup": [], "wine sauce oxtail with rice": [], "five spices chicken with rice": [], "hai nam style chicken with rice": [], "grilled pork chop with rice": [], "grilled bbq pork with rice": [], "curry chicken with rice": [], "curry beef stew with rice": [], "curry chicken with bread": [{"excerpts": ["Curry Chicken with Bread - the flavor of the curry sauce was actually nice, but the chicken and bread Not.

So we decided to try this place since it was close to our fellow shooter's home and we can conveniently drop him off home afterward.  What was ordered:\n\nSpring Roll filled with shrimp and pork - well wrapped but no flavor, worst than bland.  How is that even possible, I have no idea.  I suppose they assume you can drink the accompanied peanut hoisin sauce, which was watered down, you can't even taste the sauce.  \n\nFried Chicken - another bland dish.  All this dish was, was just the name.  No seasoning or anything.  Fried right and not greasy, but blah.  \n\nCurry Chicken with Bread - the flavor of the curry sauce was actually nice, but the chicken and bread Not.  I can tell that the chicken meat tasted weird and not quality grade.\n\nBun Ouc/Sea Snail Rice Noodle Soup - You don't get this dish in most Vietnamese restaurant, so I just have to have it.  It was nicely prepared with generous amount of sea snails but lacking the fragrant herb and spice flavors as far as authenticity.    They also used canned tomatoes, which was not as good as fresh tomatoes.  It was overall okay.\n\nService sucks they brought out the appetizers 20 minutes after the entrees came out.  The entrees were 10 minutes apart from one another.  As you may imagine, not fun watching someone else eat first and half finish before yours arrive or have their food get cold, if they so choose to wait to eat with you.  This kind of poor service really ruined the restaurant experience  of enjoying food together.
