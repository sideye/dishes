The place was full so we grabbed three stools at the bar, pretty much dead center in the middle of it.\n\nWe ordered our drinks and then asked for a kitchen menu. After we had figured out what we wanted (and closed our menus) it took about twenty minutes before the bartender even took our order. People kept asking to borrow our menus and somehow were able to order before us.\n\nThe drinks were pretty good. I had a few margaritas, they were 6$ (that may be a special as it was a Saturday) for a full beer glass full of margarita. I wouldn't say it was special but it was definitely a good standard and I enjoyed drinking them. \n\nThey clearly weren't equipped to handle the traffic from the craft fair, as we waited over an hour and a half for our food. At that point, the three of us each had had at least two drinks, so we were drunk on an empty stomach which only made it worse. Our bartender took our order and from what we could gather, never put a ticket in to the kitchen.(She never admitted it, though; just said that the kitchen was \"slammed.\" When our order came out, it was all wrong - we got a salad instead of a sandwich and my quesadilla was lacking the meat I ordered in it, which all leads me to believe she forgot to put it in and then was too embarrassed to ask us to repeat it after realizing.) Another one of the bartenders responded to our complaint and checked on the order and it was still another 1/2 hour before we got our food. (She was nice enough to equip us with some bar snacks. Appreciated.) When the manager found out, he comped us our food and apologized, which we all also appreciated. \n\nThe food was slightly above average bar food - I had a quesadilla and the side of pico that came with it was salty and had a nice amount of heat to it. We had wings that were okay, and the nachos with carnitas were also just okay. My friend's salad was topped with steak (she had ordered the steak sandwich) that was really tasty and cooked to a nice medium rare. Overall, nothing special, but definitely not greasy bar food like you would expect - nice.\n\nI liked the music and despite all their errors I was still cheering this place on. Bartenders and management were friendly - and also to his tribute, we saw the manager jump in to the kitchen to try to help the chef out once he figured what was going on. I appreciate that he was willing to get his hands dirty to help the situation and make his customers happy.\n\nI'd be back if there isn't anything going on at the convention center and they aren't swamped. Seems like it would normally be a nice chill place for a Saturday afternoon. Also liked that they had the doors open so you got some sunshine.\n\nI think this place would normally be 3 stars - just ok - but due to the service problems I really can't give them that rating.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-12-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I have tried the quesadilla, the tacos, the nachos, and the potato skins.
