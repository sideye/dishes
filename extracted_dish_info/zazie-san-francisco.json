"], "author": "Donovan H.", "review": "If you happen to be in the Cole Valley neighborhood of San Francisco and are in need of an above average brunch spot, look no further because \"Zazie\" just might be what you're looking for. I've had this place on my radar for a very long time; not just because of the thousands (yes I said thousands) of Yelp reviews but because I've heard some very good things about their food.\n\nLocated directly on Cole St. (adjacent to Carl St.), \"Zazie\" has been serving quality food ever since they opened their doors back in 1992. What makes this restaurant uniquely special is that the owner takes great care of his staff and employees by providing them with full insurance, sick pay, vacation, and 401K. Additionally, they are a \"no tips required\" restaurant meaning every single menu item is paid out directly to the staff as revenue share. If only more places can adopt this concept, there will be many, many more happy employees!\n\nI came here with my lovely lady on a Sunday morning around 10:45am. As I wrote my name on the waiting list, there were at least 15 names above mine. Luckily, we were able to walk to a nearby Peet's Coffee (which is only about 50 feet away) to grab our cup of Joe while we waited. I was expecting at least an hour wait; fortunately they called my name in only 35 short minutes! But when dining here, you should definitely expect to wait awhile; especially on busy weekend mornings.\n\nOnce we were seated, I noticed that the interior is relatively small (hence the reason for the long wait). However, there are a few tables in the front as well as an impressive back patio (that I only briefly saw) that can seat many parties. Some of the neat features of \"Zazie\" are its spiral staircase near the front, brick walls to give it a classic rustic feel, and a lot of French artwork throughout.\n\nWithin just a few minutes, our waiter takes our orders. My beverage of choice was their \"Zazie Spritzer\" (cranberry juice, orange juice, and Perrier water) while she opted for a freshly squeezed \"Odwalla orange juice\" (both priced at $3.25). My meal of choice consisted of their \"Monaco Poached Egg\" dish (priced at $15.00). This consisted of prosciutto and tomatoes proven\u00e7ales complete with Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin and a side of home fries. Her meal was a basic one egg breakfast complete with white toast and home fries (priced at $9.00).\n\nAs busy as it was, the staff were working very quickly to get everyone's dishes out in a timely manner. Our meals came out in about 20 minutes which was a respectable time considering how busy it was. As far as the presentation, my meal looked on point. It was a bit on the small side (hence the reason for deducting one star) but considering that the tip is included, I don't want to be too critical of the portion size. As far as the flavor, I loved the consistency of the prosciutto while the eggs were cooked to perfection. It wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely on the higher end of the spectrum. She also loved her meal as the garlic added a nice zest to her home fries.\n\nI do have to say, as a first-time at \"Zazie's\", I was quite satisfied with my brunch. The menu is quite extensive as they offer several traditional breakfast options as well as a few unique items with that French twist. And if breakfast just isn't your thing, their dinner menu offers many eclectic entrees and desserts. I do know with the regulars and locals that frequent this place, I don't see this place going away anytime soon.

When we were driving there, I knew I've been craving some poached eggs, but also heard so much about their carb heavy french toast and gingerbread pancakes.  I've been craving poached eggs, especially since they can be a little tricky to make at home..always go with your gut instinct/craving, right?  \n\nAbout a minute after being seated on the patio I finally decided on two poached eggs, but the dilemma was which one?  I wanted the crab one, but crab season was over, so I went with the Monaco, which was a proscuitto and tomato provanceles.  He went with the two egg St. Trop which consisted of smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers and red onions.  We both also chose the side of home fries over the salad, after all it's breakfast NOT lunch..haha.  \n\nAfter some time, our wonderful eggs were presented in front of us.  They tasted as good as they looked.  The eggs were perfectly cooked as the yolk oozed from them as it was punctured, coating my wonderfully salty delicious proscuitto on top of the english muffin.  The hollandaise sauce was nice and light, we didn't taste any hint of lemon though.   His eggs were cooked just as well and the salmon was so fresh.  The cream cheese, red onions and capers worked well with the salmon and the drizzle of hollandaise sauce as well.  We thought it was a little odd that cooked pieces of garlic with the peels on were thrown on to our plate with the home fries.  We cracked open some of the garlic and it didn't have much flavor to them nor did it give the home fries any flavor either.  In fact, the home fries were a little on the bland side.  \n\nLoved the cute patio with those awesome space heaters.  I'd prefer a seat on the patio too as it's a little cramped inside.  Service was a little on the slow side, but not bad.  Glad I finally got to try Zazie.

I love their potatoes (especially the gooey, whole roasted cloves of garlic) but often choose salad instead for something light. Any of their miracle pancakes are incredible, and I have been dying to try the bread pudding ones but unfortunately these are (obviously) incredibly popular and I don't often make it in early enough! Their Oatmeal Brulee with bruleed bananas or French Toast Tahiti are both delightful sweet dishes.\n\nThis review is reaching book proportions, but I should mention their chai and espresso drinks come in giant bowls that are both impressive and delicious, though I am happy enough with just a cup of their drip coffee. \n\nLastly, the owner of Zazie is a wonderful woman who also came from waiting in the service industry and has worked hard to make sure her staff is taken good care of and know they are not just interchangeable. They all receive full benefits, dental, paid sick leave, 401k, and profit sharing. They recently made news by becoming the first restaurant in San Francisco to become tip free!

The St. Trop has fresh, thin-sliced smoked salmon that is melt in your mouth silky and delicious! I'm not a big fan of raw onions and capers, so I liked how those two ingredients' tastes were very mild. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the Monaco because I thought the tomato flavor was overwhelming and I could barely taste the prosciutto, which is surprising because it's cured meat!

I also like indulging in things like chicken fried steak, corned beef hash and buttermilk biscuits w/ gravy. Cardiac Arrest is usually what I order for breakfast because there's nothing like starting your day with a heart-stopping, artery clogging delicious meal. \n\nFortunately for me, I rarely eat breakfast. Shame on me, I know. However, I usually wake up with just enough time to sh*t, shave and shower before heading out the door for work. \n\nLet me paint you my first and only Zazie experience. My gf and I met up with three of our friends in the city. We got to Zazie at 2:15pm this past Saturday and there was a horde of people waiting outside. For a place famous for its breakfast/brunch, I was extremely surprised patrons were still lining up well after lunch time. We put our name down after the host told us it would only be a 30 minute way. I didn't believe him but he proved me wrong. We were seated at 2:45pm.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a table in the back patio. It's quaint, cozy and perfect for a sunny day. The girls loved it. I was hungry. Sh*t was about to get real. \n\nI looked over the menu to find that it didn't have my typical heart stoppers. Chicken fried steak, where are you? Corned beef hash, show yourself! Instead, Zazie's menu was littered with exotic scrambles, lovely benedicts, power pancakes, soups, salads, sandwiches and other typical brunchy items. \n\nEGGS DIVORCE ~ 3 stars: Not listed on the menu. This was a special that day. Sitting on top of each toasted English muffin was a poached egg, fontina cheese, avocado slices, bacon and \"fabulous\" lemon hollandaise. Like all scrambles and benedicts, you can order 1, 2 or 3 eggs. I went with 3 and got a side of home fries... Told you sh*t was gonna get real. The hollandaise sauce was good, but I wouldn't call it fabulous. It was pretty standard which doesn't make it a bad thing. It just tasted like typical hollandaise. The benedict was good but not great. Honestly, It tasted exactly like I expected. It didn't blow my mind. However, I really enjoyed the homefries that came with roasted garlic cloves. It's weird, garlic isn't something you ever put in your breakfast, but Zazie made it work with the potatoes. Nice touch. \n\nMONACO ~ 2.5 stars: My gf got this. Poached egg, hollandaise, prosciutto, tomatoes provencales on top of an English muffin. She kept it cool and only got 1. I tried it and it wasn't great. In my opinion, you should never get benedict with prosciutto because it gets lost in the yolk, muffin and hollandaise. Why get something if you can't even taste it? \n\nBEET SALAD w/ GOAT CHEESE ~ 4 stars: Nice salad. The beets were cooked perfectly and the dressing wasn't too heavy. \n\nGINGERBREAD PANCAKES ~ 3 stars: Before you get loco on my ass, let me explain. I don't like pancakes. I don't like waffles. I don't like anything sweet for the first meal of my day. It just doesn't fly with me. However, if you like pancakes, this is something you have to try. After sampling a bite, I can see why so many people love this menu item. It will absolutely satisfy your sweet tooth and tummy. \n\nSABE SAKE VODKA BLOODY MARY~ 4 stars: An excellent Bloody Mary with great flavor. I wish it was a bit thicker but other than that, it was almost perfect. \n\nOne of our friends ordered a scramble and another got something else. I didn't try either one so I can't say anything about it. However, the scramble looked really good. \n\nI wasn't blown away by Zazie. The food was ok, not great. However, I think the ambiance is fantastic. \n\nWould I ever go back? Probably not...

There's this spiral black staircase that goes to a small second level landing at the front. I want to buy out this restaurant and just live in this space.. but then I would never taste their delicious food again.\n- The estimated 1 hour wait became only 20 minutes for the 2 of us (during brunch rush hour - 11am on a Sunday!).\n- Friendly, prompt service. As I was waiting by the kitchen for the restroom, I talked to the chefs as I kept seeing dishes that looked awesome and they were really nice and told me what everything was and what was in it.\n- Love love love that you can order just one slice of French toast/ pancake/ egg. It's slightly more pricey but you get to try so much more off the menu without filling yourself to the brim.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- A little on the pricey side, especially if you order a single toast/ pancake/ egg etc. (we did that and it was $21 before tax & tip). But... kinda worth it.\n\nWe ordered.. \n\n* Monaco Poached Egg (w/ prosciutto & tomatoes provencales) - WOW I had no idea I could love eggs benedict so much! I'm totally a sweet (vs. savory) brunch person, but surprisingly in this meal I liked this dish the most. Crispy, almost burnt English muffin + salty chewy prosciutto + tart squishy tomato = all of your sense are flipping out. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti (w/ caramelized bananas) - Incredibly soft, chewy, moist. Really great. However (Miss French Toast here - this is so my thing at brunch) it was really lacking that slight crunch on the outside of the bread. And the caramelized bananas had a kind of odd bitter aftertaste - I found myself putting it on the side so it wouldn't ruin the flavor on each bite of French toast.\n\n* Gingerbread Pancakes (w/ lemon curd & roasted pears)- Oh my god the flavor was wonderful! Very strong but it went perfectly with the combination of sweet maple syrup + tart lemon curd + pear. It was super thick and almost cake-like, fluffy yet dense. However (me being picky again) I found it just a tad too dry - I couldn't handle a single bite without dipping the pancake in syrup or the lemon curd to make it moist. I wish I could enjoy the great ginger flavor of the pancake alone.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-02-02"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the Monaco... which was... AMAZING.

I like how you can get 1, 2 or 3 slices of big fatty toast. It's one slice of bread, walnut paste, bread, bananas, etc. Comes with a side of syrup which honestly doesn't need to be used b/c this dish was flavorful enough.\n\nCROQUE MADAME\nThis was somewhat messy. The cheese was a bit on the watery side so it was hard to cut my sandwich and keep it a sandwich. It soon turned into a pile of bread, cheeses, ham, and runny egg. It was still good. I didn't even bother touching the side of greens on my plate. \n\nBENEDICTS\nI believe Zazie is the only place I know of in SF where you can get 1, 2 or 3 benedicts. THREE?? HELL YEAH. Three of my buds ordered 3 different kinds and ended up swapping. I was able to try three kinds: ALBERT (bacon, white cheddar, salsa), MONACO (prosciutto and tomatoes), and the LA MER (crab, avos, green onions). \n\nALBERT - The bacon was definitely very flavorful and thus took over the taste of the benedict. Nonetheless, it was still good.\nMONACO - the prosciutto was a bit chewy but I think this was the best benedict. The flavors of the prosciutto wasn't over powering and everything went well together.\nLA MER - Bland!! Since the hollandaise sauce is a light lemoney sauce, this definitely did not help that the crab wasn't very flavorful, and the fact that avos don't really have much of a taste to it. This was just mushy from the avos and sauce, and stringy from the crab.\n\n7x7.com states that you have to have a benedict at Zazie before you die, but I honestly beg to differ. The poached eggs on the la mer benedict was overdone. It wasn't runny at all. We should have had them change it but we already waited so long for food we didn't really care. The hollandaise sauce for the benedicts could have been a tad bit more flavorful, but I do appreciate how it wasn't overpowering. \n\nAll in all, Zazie is a good place to come to brunch if you want to control the portions you eat for breakfast since you an order 1, 2 or 3 pieces of french toast and same goes with benedicts.

We came at around 10:30 aka peak brunch time, but we luckily nabbed one of the tables in front and avoided the 1.5hr + wait time. While this is also a pro there's also a reason why they do this - it can get hot on a sunny day because they don't have any cover or umbrellas out front for shade. So if you're willing to do this option definitely slather on that sunscreen. \n\nFUN FACT: Zazie is tip free because their menu prices include a living wage, PTO, etc for their employees. Makes the not ridiculously crazy price tag sound even better right? \n\nTheir menu itself if quite extensive ranging from starters, eggs any style, eggs benedicts, scrambled egg dishes, griddle dishes, soups, salads, and their plats du jour which is constantly changing. Needless to say the menu is quite egg-cellent. What's great about Zazie too is that they price based on how many eggs, griddles, etc you want in variables 1, 2, and 3 so prices can be as low as $9 and as high as $38.\n\nI ended up getting the the 2 Albert Benedict (bacon, white cheddar, salsa fresca) w/home fries for $21. I thought the portions were decent for the price and the quality was there. The bacon was crispy, cheddar melted, and eggs yolky enough. The home fries are the clear winner though especially with the chunks of garlic mixed in. If you're in a drinking mood try the spicy mango mimosa - basically a mangonada for breakfast!\n\nCan't complain about our service experience here either. Our waiter was attentive and he never made us feel like we weren't taken care of in the front of the restaurant. All in all, not a shabby first time here at this infamous SF brunch spot.

Now, while the latter was true, the wait still sucked, and, with waits like this, the expectations are raised exponentially. We ended up getting a smattering of dishes (to compensate for the long wait, in a way), including:\n\n* Brunch Flight (Challah French Toast, Lemon Ricotta Pancake, Gingerbread Pancake) - A little something our waiter helped put together for us to help us save a few bucks, since we were ordering one of each of these anyway. The Challah French toast had good texture, but was on the bland side (especially compared to the Tahiti), while the pancakes were both enjoyable, but slightly denser and sweeter than I would have preferred. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti - On first bite and impression, the Tahiti is a pretty tasty dish. By the second bite though, you start to find that it's a bit too sweet (even without the additional syrup), and a bit too mushy, with very little to offset the softness of both the toast and the bananas.\n\n* Albert Eggs Benedict - Maybe I just like my savory foods more, but this was definitely the best of the bunch.

My friend, which did order the fries, were half and half on how they felt.  Some didn't like the abundance of garlic (the garlic was still shelled too) while others enjoyed the garlic.  They give a pretty fair ratio of garlic and potatoes so if you're not a fan of garlic, I'd probably stay away.  \n\nAnd being brunch, my friends were expecting free refills with coffee, which were granted without asking.  Awesome.  I didn't leave gut busting full but I did leave very content with the food hitting the spot.  I mean brunch shouldn't put you to sleep anyway.

The process of finding parking is unbearable!  To make matters worse, Zazie does not take reservations for lunch/brunch.  Because we arrived late at 2pm, however, the wait was only approximately 20 minutes.  Twenty minutes - to me - was manageable.\n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly small - a modest French bistro with a warm, light-hearted atmosphere.  The best part of the place is their charming patio area in the back - which was where we were seated luckily.\n\n[ DINING EXPERIENCE ]\n\nAs an eggs benedict connoisseur, it was a given that my hungry eyes would immediately go to their \"Poached Eggs\" section.  I ordered the \"Albert,\" which comes with bacon, white cheddar, and salsa fresco.  (Though, with my taste buds not feeling that adventurous this day, I asked for no salsa.)\n\nMy dish was delectable!  The poached eggs and bacon were cooked to my absolute satisfaction.  The eggs were not watery at all, and the yolk was cooked to perfection.  (Note: You can always tell how well a poached egg is cooked by examining how the yolk flows when you cut into it with your knife).\n\nMy dish was also accompanied by salad, but how much can you say about a side salad?  I picked at my frends' home fries and they were simply fair in my opinion.  They were engrossed with a nice garlic flavor, but were too soggy for my liking. \n\nOverall, I had a memorable meal and will definitely come back for more!

We ordered a ton of food for only ~$20/person.  There are those typical \"breakfast / brunch places\" and then there are those fabulous breakfast/brunch places that make you realize how much you LOVE breakfast foods like eggs (poached, scrambled, omelet-style), bacon, ham, Eggs Benedict, bagels, toast, sandwiches, juice and oatmeal.  \n\nI had been getting into a sad rut where I loved breakfast foods but had not found a place that really showcased such breakfast items in a way that justified spending $12 on eggs and carbs and also make me think, \"WOW.\"  Zazie changed that with their hearty yet delicate lunch that was delicious through and through!  :)\n\nGINGERBREAD PANCAKES (4/5):  Light and delicious, the flavor of the gingerbread pancakes were brought out by a sweet lemon curd along with a slice of caramelized pear.  YUM.  A stack of 2 gingerbread pancakes will easily feed a table of four.\n\nTAHITI FRENCH TOAST (5/5):  Yes, it's that good!  The french toast was huge and buttery soft and paired perfectly with walnut cream and caramelized strips of banana.  SO exquisite and delicious.  This French Toast doesn't make you feel like you're just eating filler carbs because this is a great dish in its own right. A definite must order with your brunch entree.\n\nEGGS BENEDICT (5/5):  Whatever you order (the Floretine, Pierre Noire, the Albert), the poached eggs are huge and perfect!  The eggs benedict made me fall in love with breakfast all over again.  The poached eggs had the perfect consistency (not overdone, a little runny, held its perfect little shape on top of the English muffin, tomatoes and bacon). \n\nThe roasted potatoes and garlic that accompany the egg dishes are delicious.  The potatoes are a little oily but there's some kind of intense, robust flavor that makes it hard to stop eating the potatoes and doesn't make you feel like you're just eating those typical roasted rosemary potatoes.  You really feel like you're eating a hearty, flavorful breakfast that someone took a lot of thought into preparing.  So good!  You can choose from 1 to 2 to 3 eggs at different prices ($9 / 12 / 16 (i think)).\n\nSANDWICHES (4/5):  Very good as well!  We had the sandwich with a fried egg, ham, melted cheese and a side salad of mixed greens.  The sandwich is very good, but we found ourselves going to the eggs benedict more.  I think my friends had a delicious ahi tuna sandwich-- will definitely try that next time. \n\nWAIT:  We waited for approximately 30-40 minutes on a Sunday at 1 p.m.  The wait dies down significantly by 2 p.m., but that's because the restaurant closes at 2:30 p.m.  This place is worth the wait- you won't be disappointed. \n\nUNIQUE:  Zazie is an affordable and unique local gem that embraces SF's \"go green\" mentality and features a delicious brunch that'll have you talking about it the entire day (no joke!).  Zazie has two outdoor seating tables in front of the restaurant, a handful of wooden tables indoors and a beautiful backyard/patio seating area outside.  \n\nCUTE:  Everything about this place is great!  Zazie has super cute, painted plates and a comfortable (and comforting) feel to the restaurant.  You'll find yourself spending over an hour or two eating and chatting with friends without even knowing it!  There's homemade jam (slightly sweet and tart) on the table as well.\n\nMIMOSA:  The mimosa drinks looked delicious.  They had a fresh mango mimosa that I would definitely try. (Reminds me of what The Grape Leaf Inn served in Napa.)\n\nDINNER:  The dinner at Zazie looks pretty darn good, especially since they pair it with community-friendly outreach-type incentives like no corkage-fee nights, dog-friendly nights and prie fix menues for ~$28.

Since the hollandaise sauce is a light lemoney sauce, this definitely did not help that the crab wasn't very flavorful, and the fact that avos don't really have much of a taste to it. This was just mushy from the avos and sauce, and stringy from the crab.\n\n7x7.com states that you have to have a benedict at Zazie before you die, but I honestly beg to differ. The poached eggs on the la mer benedict was overdone. It wasn't runny at all. We should have had them change it but we already waited so long for food we didn't really care. The hollandaise sauce for the benedicts could have been a tad bit more flavorful, but I do appreciate how it wasn't overpowering. \n\nAll in all, Zazie is a good place to come to brunch if you want to control the portions you eat for breakfast since you an order 1, 2 or 3 pieces of french toast and same goes with benedicts.

So near my home, so near my heart. \n\nOkay, I'm just kidding. But it is near my house, which is wonderful because I don't ever have to find parking and don't have to experience driving out to Cole Valley only to see hoards of people in line for breakfast! Living close by actually means that I get to come here sometimes when there is no wait, and that is a fabulous thing. \nThere are a zillion reviews for Zazie, so I won't bore you with the same old review, but I will list a few of my favorites and a few I'd rather not have ever again.\n\nBEST: Eggs Albert (although I get my eggs scrambled), un deux trois with chicken apple sausage (did someone say \"combo made in heaven?\"), pancakes in general, provencal fish soup (the small bowl)\n\nNO THANKS: Salade Betterave (it was not a cohesive salad and tasted thrown together, plus the beets weren't very good), Oatmeal Brulee (it was just a bit bland), the Scrambles in general are just too furiously scrambled... there is nothing delicate about them, which is important when scrambling eggs or else it winds up tasting like mush.\n\nCOMPLAINT: I think they should make more omelettes and they should make their omelettes differently. I hate omelettes that are like egg paties folded over the other ingredients. If I wanted an egg patty with a side of mushrooms, I would have ordered that... so put them inside the omelette, already! I don't care if that is a standard technique, it is not yummy and that's the most important aspect of good food... it tastes good. Plus, when I ordered an omelette once (and only once, in all fairness), it looked like my chihuahua could have eaten it and still been hungry. I know it comes with potatoes and toast and stuff, but if I want omelette, I want to eat mostly omelette and not rely on the accompaniments to fill me up.

Zazie has numerous variations of poached eggs on english muffins.\n\nAlso, they allow you to determine the size of your brunch.  Would you like one poached egg or two (or three or...)?  One piece of french toast or two (or...)?  I know, why don't you just eat one and leave the other?  Because I have no self-control.  I eat *everything* put in front of me, even if I'm way past full.\n\nI've also had their French Toast Tahiti (I think that was the name) -- french toast \"stuffed\" with carmelized bananas and walnuts.  While they weren't really stuffed (more like, put between two pieces of french toast), it was still quite tasty.  Although, I realize that I prefer savory for breakfast (but it just sounded sooo good).\n\nI subtracted one star b/c my eggs over medium were really eggs over easy.  There was even uncooked egg white, which kinda grossed me out.  I'm almost tempted to subtract another star for their slow service and long waits.  But the service, while slow, was still pleasant, and all good brunch spots seem to have ridiculously long waits these days (or rather, years?  I thought the dot-com bubble burst in '01 was going to bring us back to normal brunch waits; ***sigh***).\n\nUPDATE:  So, after writing this review, the owner writes me a very nice note.  I write her back and mention that the next time I go, I'll say hello.  \n\nI went again Presidents' Day Monday.  Things were quite busy, and I think the owner was working as the hostess.  I was going to say hello, but our service that day was just so bad, I didn't even feel like bothering. \n\nOur waitress was totally absent -- she never checked in on us, we had to keep looking for her to come outside again and then flag her down (can we get menus?  can I get another mimosa?  can we get more coffee?  hot sauce?  extra hollandaise?).  She never asked how our food was or else they would've gotten the feedback that there wasn't any hollandaise sauce (ok, maybe just a wee bit) on my boyfriend's poached eggs (albert) and that my poached egg was cooked hard (st. trop).\n\nEven if our service was terrible, our food was still pretty good (once we got the extra hollandaise, and I just got over the fact that if I wanted a new poached egg, I'd probably be waiting forever for it...  way past after my boyfriend would be done with his breakfast...).\n\nRelatedly, my boyfriend's sister went to Zazie for lunch last week and also had terrible service and terrible food (I only remember she'd mentioned cold toast brought with butter, which she wasn't able to spread).  So, I think this may be our last trip to Zazie for a while...  which I must admit I'm a little sad about b/c I do like their eggs...  but it's no good to leave brunch on a beautiful day feeling pissy b/c of your service.

We paid $17 for a sad, small plate (pictured below)...at least fill the plate up with homefries so it kind of looks like it's worth $17. Our favorite was the special pumpkin miracle pancakes, which weren't too sweet...and topped with a scoop of real pumpkin on top. The special omelette that weekend was a great combo of squash, goat cheese (I don't usually like goat cheese, but it was a GREAT pairing) and greens. We were extremely satisfied with the food, but we felt like the La Mer wasn't worth the $17.

I hope Zazie's system of paying their employees a great wage is working out for them...this guy just didn't seem too pumped to be at work.\n\nLastly, their restrooms need more work. There's a tiny one wedged in the back of the house across from the kitchen window...so if there's a line (which there always is for women), then you'll find yourself standing in the space of the servers/kitchen/BOH, and just feeling in the way.

Order one egg for your Benedict and one piece of toast :)\n\nOn to the actual benedicts, the Saint Trop (smoked salmon), Florentine (spinach and mushrooms) and La Mer (lobster) are all divine. The potatoes are baked crispy, and the eggs ooze yolk for that perfect creaminess\n\nIf you're looking for a sweeter breakfast, try their gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd and poached pear. Incredibly fluffy and not terribly sweet either. Or their French toast Tahiti. \n\nThey've got a nice selection of mimosas to top off your brunch :) grapefruit is my personal favorite.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-12-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I got as usual my signature Eggs Benedict dish this time called La Mer with hand picked dungeness crab, avocados, and green onions with a side of home fries.

"], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "This is a very busy French brunch spot in the heart of Cole Valley which is not exactly touristy but filled with plenty of locals and a heartbeat away from Haight Ashbury and Golden Gate Park, so yes plenty of tourists do come! The food is solid and plentiful if nothing necessarily stands out, but then again I've only been once. Among the many fabulous places to enjoy a weekend brunch in the city this is probably in the top 15, and that still says a lot in a competitive market like San Francisco.\n\nZazie is a comfortable cute little bistro that specializes in brunch and lunch dishes with a French flair. And I personally love French food, mind you that none of us in our party actually got French food to dine on. The drinks are a real delight here. I had the signature refresher called Le Metro which has fortified wine, sparkling lemonade, lavender simple syrup, and champagne. I found it to be a delight that was zingy and not over powerful. My friend had the summer drink special called the Pamplune Spritz which contained rose wine with grapefruit and peach essence topped with champagne. That drink felt way too watered down and quite frankly, didn't have a kick.    \n\nZazie has become one of many San Francisco establishments that have done away with gratuity for their staff and have increased prices to make sure their staff is paid a decent wage by increasing their dish prices. Now I have never eaten here before, so I don't know if their was a significantly increased prices on their dishes. But the menu also says they have fully funded health and dental insurance, paid sick leave, and a 401K with an employer match for ALL of their employees. Now that says a lot for a small restaurant to do all that for all of their staff!\n\nMy friend had a dish on their summer brunch special menu called the \"Eggs En Fonte\" which was two over easy eggs served on a corn cake with spinach, avocados, tomato-chevre sauce all served on a iron skillet. Not sure what was French about that dish but my friend loved it none the less. I got as usual my signature Eggs Benedict dish this time called La Mer with hand picked dungeness crab, avocados, and green onions with a side of home fries. I liked my dish, it was 24 dollars even for a two egg dish, which was a good deal for the intricately pulled crab pieces. You can tell they use fresh ingredients and that is what matters here!\n\nI like Zazie, if you're in the Cole Valley neighborhood and looking for a bite for brunch or lunch, then it's worth a visit. Not exactly sure if it's worth a drive all the way out to the western part of San Francisco, where parking can be limited. But a small locally owned restaurant with fresh ingredients and a little flair that boasts about treating their employees with dignity gets an extra star in my book.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-07-08"}, {"excerpts": ["#La Mer", ": A-.\n", "La Mer is a poached-egg-on-muffin dish with dungeness crab meat.

Read some reviews from fellow Yelpers about how getting to Zazie at 9am on Sunday (which it opens at 9 by the way) still ended up a one-hour wait, I decided this is not going to happen to me.\n\nArrived on Sunday 8:25am and got the first spot in line woohoo! (sorry for being silly but I sacrifice sleep time for good food and *relatively* efficient-er use of time) But Yelpers are right the lines get crazy pretty early - at 8:50am there were about 25-30 people already and clearly, once the restaurant opened it quickly filled up.\n\nA lot of research has been done before getting there. Quickly decided what I wanted. One thing I really like about their menu is that its flexible - for eggs you can choose 1 to 3 eggs and so do pancakes as well.\n\n#La Mer: A-.\nLa Mer is a poached-egg-on-muffin dish with dungeness crab meat. I ordered one egg only since I wanted to try many dishes. The poached egg was very nicely made - perfect temperature and texture. The lemon hollandaise with muffin and avocado worked great together as well. Crab meat on the other hand was a bit disappointing - quantity is very little and perhaps the hollandaise covered it (?) I couldn't really find the crab meat taste at all. I would go for other meat type (the prosciutto one?) next time.\n\nEach poached egg dish comes with a side - either home fries (more like potatoes) or salad. I don't know about the salad but GET THE HOME FRIES! It was so good and became highlight of the dish. The potatoes were perfectly grilled/fried and with a strong sense of garlic. In fact there was one piece of roasted garlic included (accidentally?) and it was super tasty even though I'm not really a eat-whole-piece-garlic of person. Wonderful!\n\n#French Toast Tahiti: A-.\nOrdered one toast for this. While the caramelized banana was simply within expectation, it was the walnuts filling that set a major difference. I'm a huge fan for walnut - the filling perfectly carried out the original walnut taste without being too sweet. The french toast itself was above average.\n\n#Gingerbread Pancake: B+.\nI usually like gingerbread a lot (e.g. the seasonal gingerbread latte from starbucks) and although this pancake did have a sense of gingerbread to it, I did not find it to be impressive. The texture of the pancake was fluffy and that was about it. But luckily the lemon curd saved it - it was so lemonish and this combination of lemon curd and pancakes was so brilliant.\n\nBeing a restaurant with thousands of good reviews I was expecting mediocre service - but not really. My server was super nice and willing to patiently explain the menu to the customers on next table. Very attentive as well and kept coming back to my table for coffee refill. \n\nI would definitely come back for other poached eggs and probably the miracle pancakes too!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered and shared three things; the La Mer eggs benedict, New York scramble and the Tahiti French Toast.

I'll be honest, it's mostly because I think it's worth pointing out that (as of June 2015) they have a really great no-tipping policy.

The St. Trop has fresh, thin-sliced smoked salmon that is melt in your mouth silky and delicious! I'm not a big fan of raw onions and capers, so I liked how those two ingredients' tastes were very mild.

Not only were we full from the other dishes, but the pancakes were all dense and dry. The buttermilk pancake was decent, but I couldn't help but equate it to my Krusteaz mix at home. Now, add a dollop of the raspberry jam on your table, and you've got yourself a winner. That jam is like crack! The gingerbread pancake was notably thick and heavy with subtle ginger tones. The stewed pear outshines the pancake by far. And the miracle pancake tasted a LOT like cornbread and definitely needed the lemon curd for flavor. The first few bites were offsetting, but after I readjusted my perspective, I decided that this was the tastiest cornbread I had ever had. Also, their maple syrup was less viscous than expected and not overpoweringly sweet.\n\nService was spot on, and water refills were frequent.

Good thing I only had one pancake because these were thick and almost cake like. I'm usually not a big fan of ginger, but the ginger taste was not too over powering and complimented the pear and the lemon curd very well.\n\nOverall, Zazie is a great place for brunch especially after a long battle with neighboring warlords.

Limit yourselves to only 4 people MAX. Anyway, we put our name down for 7 people and waited 1.5 hours only to find out that the host was going to split us up into a table of 2 then 5. Why didn't he tell us this earlier? Every 10 minutes he would go back to the chart and look at who was signed up and I'm sure he could have told us. We were disappointed that we couldn't sit together. \n\nNow onto the food, which wasn't bad at all...\n\nFRENCH TOAST TAHITI\nThe walnut paste that comes with it is delicious! I like how you can get 1, 2 or 3 slices of big fatty toast. It's one slice of bread, walnut paste, bread, bananas, etc. Comes with a side of syrup which honestly doesn't need to be used b/c this dish was flavorful enough.\n\nCROQUE MADAME\nThis was somewhat messy. The cheese was a bit on the watery side so it was hard to cut my sandwich and keep it a sandwich. It soon turned into a pile of bread, cheeses, ham, and runny egg. It was still good. I didn't even bother touching the side of greens on my plate. \n\nBENEDICTS\nI believe Zazie is the only place I know of in SF where you can get 1, 2 or 3 benedicts. THREE?? HELL YEAH. Three of my buds ordered 3 different kinds and ended up swapping. I was able to try three kinds: ALBERT (bacon, white cheddar, salsa), MONACO (prosciutto and tomatoes), and the LA MER (crab, avos, green onions). \n\nALBERT - The bacon was definitely very flavorful and thus took over the taste of the benedict. Nonetheless, it was still good.\nMONACO - the prosciutto was a bit chewy but I think this was the best benedict. The flavors of the prosciutto wasn't over powering and everything went well together.\nLA MER - Bland!! Since the hollandaise sauce is a light lemoney sauce, this definitely did not help that the crab wasn't very flavorful, and the fact that avos don't really have much of a taste to it. This was just mushy from the avos and sauce, and stringy from the crab.\n\n7x7.com states that you have to have a benedict at Zazie before you die, but I honestly beg to differ. The poached eggs on the la mer benedict was overdone. It wasn't runny at all. We should have had them change it but we already waited so long for food we didn't really care. The hollandaise sauce for the benedicts could have been a tad bit more flavorful, but I do appreciate how it wasn't overpowering. \n\nAll in all, Zazie is a good place to come to brunch if you want to control the portions you eat for breakfast since you an order 1, 2 or 3 pieces of french toast and same goes with benedicts.

But I was determined to wait it out, so my friend and I killed some time by grabbing coffee at the Peet's nearby, and then we hovered around Zazie's entrance for the remainder of the time. \n\nFinally our names were called after an hour or so, which was faster than I was expecting.The space inside was bigger than I thought, as there is not only a regular seating area but a patio all the way in the back. I only caught a glimpse of the patio as I was going to the bathroom, but it looked really cute.\n\nFood wise, my friend and I decided to each get a savory item and share a french toast. I ended up with the Eggs Fontainbleau ($16), which is scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms and spinach. I know you're probably thinking, how good could scrambled eggs be, it's just scrambled eggs! But I was in love with the eggs here.They were so soft and fluffy and not overcooked at all; And I don't know how they prepare their potatoes, but it was perfectly seasoned and soft on the inside but surprisingly crunchy on the outside. Both of us were pretty obsessed with the potatoes as well.\n\nMy friend ordered one of their benedicts, which they're known for, and commented that their lemon hollandaise sauce was very light compared to the other hollandaise sauces that she's had.\n\nThe french toast was also good but not as mind blowing as the savory dishes were for us. This could've been because we ate it last, so it had been sitting on the table getting cold for a while before we dug in?\n\nAlso I LOVE that for a lot of their dishes, you can choose your portion size. Not too many places in SF will let you only order one benedict or three if you're feeling extra hangry from the wait :P\n\nOur server Megan was amazing. Upon learning it was our first time at Zazie, she gave us a rundown of the most popular items on the menu and was just super helpful in general. I also really appreciated the fact that despite how busy the restaurant is and how many people are waiting outside, I never once felt rushed. She first grabbed our drink orders, and then came back and asked for our food orders instead of doing everything at once.\n\nParking wasn't too bad. I was able to find a spot two blocks away on a residential street pretty easily.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the best brunches I've had yet in the city, and I definitely want to come back, maybe try to get patio seating next time?", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-11-03"}, {"excerpts": ["The food:\n- Fontainbleau scrambled eggs ($16)", ": This came with portobello, shiitake, porcini, spinach, and fontina.

My friend and I were walking around Cole Valley trying to find the establishment, and right as we were about to pull up Google Maps, we saw a hella long line...without a question, we knew we'd found our destination. It was a Monday morning (holiday), and the line was sooooooo long!! We put our name on the list, and ultimately, I think it took close to 2 hours to be seated?? You can specify where you want to sit (which may take longer). We asked to be seated in the heated outdoor patio area (which was absolutely beautiful and had the coziest, homiest, brunch-y vibes!!)\n\nThe food:\n- Fontainbleau scrambled eggs ($16): This came with portobello, shiitake, porcini, spinach, and fontina.

Crispy on the outside and just the right amount of mashed potato-like softness on the inside!! The home fries came with roasted garlic and an absolutely divine seasoning!! I asked for hot sauce, and the server came out with a green sauce that they make in-house (I think). Smother the potatoes all over in hot sauce and...*drools*\n\n- Florentine eggs benedict (3 portion for $21): This came with saut\u00e9ed spinach and portobello mushrooms. My friend chose the salad as her side. The dish itself is served on an English muffin with lemon hollandaise. I kinda really, really, really don't like eggs benedict...I don't particularly like my eggs poached, and I REALLLLLLLY don't like hollandaise. But I genuinely enjoyed this dish?? The eggs were cooked just right--nice and runny when you cut 'em down the middle, giving you that good ol' #yolkporn!!\n\n- Pain de Mie French Toast (2 portion for $16): We chose the version of the dish that came with fruit. This French toast is made using an orange cinnamon batter, and mannnn, is it DELICIOUUUS!! I can't handle too much of anything overpoweringly sweet, but this was just amaaazing!! The French toast was super fluffy and flavorful, and it came with a mountainful of seasonal fruit (ours had cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberry, and pineapple). Drizzle it all over with syrup or add some of the delicious jam they have on the table!!\n\nYou have the option of ordering things in 1/2/3 sized portions, which is really cool, especially if you're not feeling super hungry but want to try more stuff. It's also really helpful if you're with a bunch of people and planning on ordering multiple things so you can try a lot of stuff off the menu!! They also had a bunch of really creative mimosa flavors!! I don't think they do bottomless\n\nBottom line: Don't let the line scare you. It will be WORTH. Put your name on that list and talk a walk around the neighborhood, stop by La Boulangerie for a nice warm soy latte to combat that freezing cold SF weather (I am a weakling). There is a two card max per table. Kinda really pricy, but I guess that's what you can expect from hipster brunch places in SF...you can definitely taste the quality!! And they don't take tips. The price on the menu includes living wage, revenue sharing, paid sick leave, insurance, parental leave, and 401(k)!! Pretty rad!! I will definitely be back!! I WANNA TRY EVERYTHING ON THE MENU.

House Special Pomegranate Mimosa: Zazie's mimosa menu is quite extensive so I'd highly recommend giving it a once over. We ordered the pomegranate mimosas are were more than pleased! They were deliciously fresh and contained quite a surplus of actual pomegranate pieces. \n\nPerhaps the only potential irksome tenet of Zazie is the infamously disgruntling wait that's almost always north of an hour.

Unfortunately we waited a good 25 minutes only to get seated outside (it was slightly chilly). So if you want to get a good seat (and indoors), prepare to come early and wait your turn because it's pretty much crowded all the time from what i hear and what i experienced. We also arrived at 2pm, making it even weirder that it was so crowded! Basically our tips to avoid the traffic didn't do much for us :( \n\nAmbiance: Cute little breakfast spot in SF. There is street parking so that's nice but the restaurant itself is slightly cramped in my opinion. But regardless, the outdoor seating is cute and a great place to enjoy your brunch IF the sun is out. \n\nFood: Ordered my standard egg dish and split a dessert dish with my sister. I had the Fontainbleau scramble that came with with portobellos, shiitake, porcinis, spinach, fontina. For $12, yes it was a little pricey but they don't skimp on the ingredients so you get a lot of food and the whole wheat toast was soft and delicious! The scramble was heavy, but not in a bad way.

The cinnamon taste added a perfect kick and I love that you could order just one piece rather than a stack of the french toast (same with their pancakes). \n\nDrinks: Did not get anything but got a chance to taste my sister's Cole Valley Mimosa that came with orange and cranberry. A little pricey for $8, but still pretty good in taste. \n\nTip $2: The restaurant has a strict no substitutions rule (unless you ask for something with meat, without, which is what my sister did).\n\nVerdict; Definitely worth the amazing food! 1 star off for the kind of runny scramble.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-07-15"}, {"excerpts": ["FLORENTINE POACHED EGGS\nBLT SANDWICH\nFONTAINBLEAU SCRAMBLE\n\n"], "author": "Sunny W.", "review": "**Review for breakfast/brunch**\n\n**NOTE: The waiting list is hung outside of the cafe, on your left if you're facing the door.

The line wasn't very big when we got there around 10:30 AM, but it was rapidly increasing as the time passed (it really made me wonder how come all those people weren't busy, oh idk, working or something).

The outside area is in a first come first serve basis, and you do not need to write your name down.\n\nWe got seated within 15/20 minutes, and went to eat in the patio area. The area is very cute, but the only thing that bugged me a little was how close the tables were located.

The waiter was very laid back, chill, but right there when you just about to need him.\n\n4) Prefer dinner much more than the brunch. Everything is excellent, but a bit too crowded and loud at brunch on weekends. But that's the point isn't it? Best place to go with hangover, and a great force to make sure you get up early on weekends and get there 10 minutes before 9. \n\n5) The owner loved me, so did the dishwashers.\n\nBrunch food:\n1) French Toast Tahiti: perfectly prepared french toasts, thick, fluffy, but heavenly soft. Caramelized banana adds the creamy texture, and the walnuts adds the crunchy kick. Nice and filling, yet not heavy.\n\n2) Gingerbread pancake: incredibly spongy and flavorful pancakes with a touch a lemon cream on top. Very yummy. Try it with the raspberry jam on the table. Much try at Zazie, and you'll see why it's always on the menu.\n\n3) Lemon Ricotta pancake: not the best I've tried. The best lemon ricotta cake that I've had is believe it or not, at the bar Feve in Oberlin Ohio. The cakes are too heavy, and a bit lack of flavor. The first one I got was not cooked through that tasted like the batter. Cookie dough is yummy, but not the pancake batter. Sent it back, got a better one, but still nicht so gute.\n\n4) Eggs Italie: scrambled eggs with tomatoes, cream cheese, and basil. Use your imagination. It's a great combination with good preparation. I personally make better scrambles with some pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. But Zazie cooks my brunch and takes care of the dishes, why not?\n\n3) Eggs Florentine: Best Egg benedict besides Chef and Butler. It is traditional and straight-forward. The Hollandaise is creamy but not heavy, doesn't leave the unpleasant stickiness in your mouth. Eggs perfectly poached. Bravo.\n\n6) The mimosa (grapefruit and something): not impressing at all. Couldn't finish it.\n\n7) Cappuccino: very very good, so good that I hate the fact that you can't have it refilled like a regular coffee.\n\nDinner:\n1) French Onion Soup: I would come here just for this bowl of dreams come true, especially at the end of a long tough day of 45 degrees. Very rich flavored soup, with bread crumbs that have still crunchy crust, OH MY GOD CRUNCHY CHEESY TOP.\n\n2) Salade Betterave: I love beets, and here you get 3 kinds of beets, green, gold, and red beets. I love fennels, and here you get fennels. Avocado and white gorgonzola vinegrette give the creamy texture. Yum. Everything I love thrown together, well balanced and light.\n\n3) Pate de Volaille: I hate liver of any animals. Just hate the taste. But, this one is AMAZING, like O.M.G. So smooth and creamy that just melt on your tongue, yes, THAT good. It doesn't have the nasty liver-y taste at all. One of our favorite dishes of the night. \n\n4) Mussels Marinieres: a little disappointed. The combination of white wine, shallots, parsley and cream is nice, very nice. But I don't like food that's \"slightly warm\", not cold, not warm, not hot, just slightly warm. It's not the best temperature to serve something creamy, I think.\n\n5) Lamb Tagine: braised lamb entree, looks much better on the menu than it tastes actually. Maybe just not my thing to throw everything together and serve it like a chinese congee. Not my favorite dish, but very well prepared I must say.\n\nDessert:\n1) Toasted Challah Bread Pudding: hands down, the best bread pudding in town, even slightly better than Tartine. Although it's not fair to compare 2 different ways of making bread pudding, I like it better at Zazie. I just love the variety of texture in the bowl, crunchy, creamy, bready, eggy, sweet, smooth, warm, but wow with the pumpkin spice icecream. Bravissimo!\n\n2) Cafe d'AUTOMNE: very interesting combination of Ciao bella Tahitian Vanilla bean and pumpkin icecream, pound cake crumbles, shot of espresso, whipped cream, and toasted almond. Interesting, but for some reason, it's just too much going on for me. But worth a try.\n\nTips: go with a group of people, like 4, get the sampler platter, choose 3  appetizers from the list of 6, and the dessert sampler platter choose 3 out of 7.

My friend and I were walking around Cole Valley trying to find the establishment, and right as we were about to pull up Google Maps, we saw a hella long line...without a question, we knew we'd found our destination. It was a Monday morning (holiday), and the line was sooooooo long!! We put our name on the list, and ultimately, I think it took close to 2 hours to be seated?? You can specify where you want to sit (which may take longer). We asked to be seated in the heated outdoor patio area (which was absolutely beautiful and had the coziest, homiest, brunch-y vibes!!)\n\nThe food:\n- Fontainbleau scrambled eggs ($16): This came with portobello, shiitake, porcini, spinach, and fontina. I chose wheat for my toast and home fries as my side. I LOOOVE scrambled eggs!! They're my favorite kind of eggs, and Zazie did it right!! The eggs weren't overcooked and were super light and fluffy and had the perfect texture. I am also a hugeee sucker for mushrooms, so I really enjoyed this dish!! THE HOME FRIES. AHHHHHHH. Home fries are hands down my favorite brunch food. I absolutely loved Zazie's!! Some of the best I've ever had!! The texture is just PERFECT. None of that mushy all over potato business. Crispy on the outside and just the right amount of mashed potato-like softness on the inside!! The home fries came with roasted garlic and an absolutely divine seasoning!! I asked for hot sauce, and the server came out with a green sauce that they make in-house (I think). Smother the potatoes all over in hot sauce and...*drools*\n\n- Florentine eggs benedict (3 portion for $21): This came with saut\u00e9ed spinach and portobello mushrooms. My friend chose the salad as her side. The dish itself is served on an English muffin with lemon hollandaise. I kinda really, really, really don't like eggs benedict...I don't particularly like my eggs poached, and I REALLLLLLLY don't like hollandaise. But I genuinely enjoyed this dish?? The eggs were cooked just right--nice and runny when you cut 'em down the middle, giving you that good ol' #yolkporn!!\n\n- Pain de Mie French Toast (2 portion for $16): We chose the version of the dish that came with fruit. This French toast is made using an orange cinnamon batter, and mannnn, is it DELICIOUUUS!! I can't handle too much of anything overpoweringly sweet, but this was just amaaazing!! The French toast was super fluffy and flavorful, and it came with a mountainful of seasonal fruit (ours had cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberry, and pineapple). Drizzle it all over with syrup or add some of the delicious jam they have on the table!!\n\nYou have the option of ordering things in 1/2/3 sized portions, which is really cool, especially if you're not feeling super hungry but want to try more stuff. It's also really helpful if you're with a bunch of people and planning on ordering multiple things so you can try a lot of stuff off the menu!! They also had a bunch of really creative mimosa flavors!! I don't think they do bottomless\n\nBottom line: Don't let the line scare you. It will be WORTH. Put your name on that list and talk a walk around the neighborhood, stop by La Boulangerie for a nice warm soy latte to combat that freezing cold SF weather (I am a weakling). There is a two card max per table. Kinda really pricy, but I guess that's what you can expect from hipster brunch places in SF...you can definitely taste the quality!! And they don't take tips. The price on the menu includes living wage, revenue sharing, paid sick leave, insurance, parental leave, and 401(k)!! Pretty rad!! I will definitely be back!! I WANNA TRY EVERYTHING ON THE MENU.

I have YET to hear about this place before finally coming and when I had seen all the people standing in front of the restaurant at 10A.M. I knew this place was quiet popular.\n\nMario, the general manager explained to us that it would be an hour wait if we wanted to sit in a group. AN HOUR WAIT!! I was SO not pleased to hear that but I totally understood. I explained to him that we were celebrating birthdays and needed to be seated together. He explained that he was a man of his word and if we waited at the Peet's Coffee right by the Zazie restaurant then he would come get us in an hour.\n\nA little after an hour our table was FINALLY ready and Mario called us! Yayy! We had a great seat in the back patio (which is such a nice area) I truly recommend seating in the back if you can! We even had complimentary Miracle Pancakes on the table waiting for us for our wait! SAY WHAT?? Could this get any better? HAHA YESSS, I'm not nearly done explaining!  \n\nWe finally ordered our brunch and I must say that everything looked SO DELICIOUS!!! If I had room to taste everything on the menu I think I probably would! Our server Servando was amazing at taking our orders and making sure we were well supplied with water. \n\nI ordered:\n~ La Mer- which comes with hand-picked Dungeness crab, avocados, green onions w/ home fries and French Toast Tahiti stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.\n\nEverything was so delicious!

Weekends are too crazy for me most of the time to get out and brunch it up, but many of the places I had bookmarked only offer brunch on weekends! Fortunately Zazie was one of the eateries open for brunch on a weekday. Zazies is a little gem, a shop on the smaller side, located in a cramped (what isn't cramped in SF) street along a hill. A friend and I went at about 12ish and there was a group of people outside waiting and a list full to the next page. Parking here is definitely a struggle, but luckily we snagged the spot right in front. It's cool that they offer the first come first serve seating right in front, in addition to a waitlist hanging on the window. Even though it looked like there were many people ahead of us on the waitlist, it went by really quickly! Our party of two was called over and man, everyone here is so friendly. Definitely one of the friendliest places I've been to! As soon as they see you walking ahead, theres someone holding the door open for you, every single employee you walk by greets you hello and goodbye, all genuinely friendly, warm smiles, and welcoming. Maybe they were lucky and just hired a great group of individuals, or their forward thinking no tip/better pay rule really makes them happier workers (which in that case, every shop should consider implementing this if they can!). \n\nSo we walk through the restaurant to get to the back patio and it's so cramped inside that my cheeks were definitely brushing against every person and table and chair. The outside patio is a tiny bit more spacious than inside, however I still had to move my chair every so often to let the person at the next table go in and out. We ended up ordering the New York scrambled eggs, 1 miracle pancake, and 1 french toast Tahiti. Normally I like to stay benedickin' during brunches (plus poached eggs make for better egg porn), but the cream cheese in the scrambled eggs was a deal breaker for us and we had no regrets. The cream cheese complimented the salmon and the soft scrambled eggs, so it was melt in your mouth goodness. The potatoes came with garlic which I loved, but they could definitely give more potatoes and a little less garlic. The french toast was also amazing! I loved that it was actually not too sweet at all. It was not a sugary sweet, but rather just a sweetness that came from the bananas. The miracle pancakes were a miss for us, however! The miracle pancakes are a special with a weekly flavor-this week is lemon ricotta pancakes with meyer lemon curd. Lemon curd sounded amazing, WHICH IT WAS, but then it also came with a raspberry sauce on it which was overly sweet and took away from the lemony flavors. We double checked the menu and on the ingredients, it didn't even say it would come with raspberry sauce! Because of preference, we just didn't like it, but what if we were allergic to it? It really should say so on the menu in the future so people won't be confused. \n\nAt the end of our meal we left feeling super stuffed and satisfied.

Read some reviews from fellow Yelpers about how getting to Zazie at 9am on Sunday (which it opens at 9 by the way) still ended up a one-hour wait, I decided this is not going to happen to me.\n\nArrived on Sunday 8:25am and got the first spot in line woohoo! (sorry for being silly but I sacrifice sleep time for good food and *relatively* efficient-er use of time) But Yelpers are right the lines get crazy pretty early - at 8:50am there were about 25-30 people already and clearly, once the restaurant opened it quickly filled up.\n\nA lot of research has been done before getting there. Quickly decided what I wanted. One thing I really like about their menu is that its flexible - for eggs you can choose 1 to 3 eggs and so do pancakes as well.\n\n#La Mer: A-.\nLa Mer is a poached-egg-on-muffin dish with dungeness crab meat. I ordered one egg only since I wanted to try many dishes. The poached egg was very nicely made - perfect temperature and texture. The lemon hollandaise with muffin and avocado worked great together as well. Crab meat on the other hand was a bit disappointing - quantity is very little and perhaps the hollandaise covered it (?) I couldn't really find the crab meat taste at all. I would go for other meat type (the prosciutto one?) next time.\n\nEach poached egg dish comes with a side - either home fries (more like potatoes) or salad. I don't know about the salad but GET THE HOME FRIES! It was so good and became highlight of the dish. The potatoes were perfectly grilled/fried and with a strong sense of garlic. In fact there was one piece of roasted garlic included (accidentally?) and it was super tasty even though I'm not really a eat-whole-piece-garlic of person. Wonderful!\n\n#French Toast Tahiti: A-.\nOrdered one toast for this. While the caramelized banana was simply within expectation, it was the walnuts filling that set a major difference. I'm a huge fan for walnut - the filling perfectly carried out the original walnut taste without being too sweet. The french toast itself was above average.\n\n#Gingerbread Pancake: B+.\nI usually like gingerbread a lot (e.g. the seasonal gingerbread latte from starbucks) and although this pancake did have a sense of gingerbread to it, I did not find it to be impressive. The texture of the pancake was fluffy and that was about it. But luckily the lemon curd saved it - it was so lemonish and this combination of lemon curd and pancakes was so brilliant.\n\nBeing a restaurant with thousands of good reviews I was expecting mediocre service - but not really. My server was super nice and willing to patiently explain the menu to the customers on next table. Very attentive as well and kept coming back to my table for coffee refill. \n\nI would definitely come back for other poached eggs and probably the miracle pancakes too!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["French Toast Tahiti (2) $15- yummmmm!\n \n", "This was food to go.

Now, while the latter was true, the wait still sucked, and, with waits like this, the expectations are raised exponentially. We ended up getting a smattering of dishes (to compensate for the long wait, in a way), including:\n\n* Brunch Flight (Challah French Toast, Lemon Ricotta Pancake, Gingerbread Pancake) - A little something our waiter helped put together for us to help us save a few bucks, since we were ordering one of each of these anyway. The Challah French toast had good texture, but was on the bland side (especially compared to the Tahiti), while the pancakes were both enjoyable, but slightly denser and sweeter than I would have preferred. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti - On first bite and impression, the Tahiti is a pretty tasty dish. By the second bite though, you start to find that it's a bit too sweet (even without the additional syrup), and a bit too mushy, with very little to offset the softness of both the toast and the bananas.\n\n* Albert Eggs Benedict - Maybe I just like my savory foods more, but this was definitely the best of the bunch. Even then though, I found it a bit lacking. Also, I think this is the first time I've ever had shredded, unmelted cheese on a benedict.\n\nSo, in the end, nothing really wowed me. If not for the wait, Zazie is easily 3 stars, but, for an an hour and a half, the food better be fucking outstanding. In the case of Zazie, I can't in good conscience bring myself here again when there are tastier, shorter options elsewhere.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The venue is a bit on the tighter side, with tables arranged in such a way that they're not all accessible.

How I haven't posted a review yet is beyond me (although its probably my subconscious selfishly not wanting any more people to know about them than already do!).\n\nAlways busy and bustling, no matter what time or day of the week. I cannot speak warmly enough of the staff, but ESPECIALLY Mario!! He is fantastic and makes every visit that much better. Mario is so friendly and accommodating, always seats me out on the back patio that I love so much and sometimes even brings me a little something extra to make my morning even sweeter.\n\nTheir Monaco Benedict (with prosciutto and tomatoes proven\u00e7ales) has absolutely ruined me, as in I can no longer order any Benedict anywhere else because theirs is so consistently fantastic and delicious, and no other restaurant can hold a candle to them. I can't help but order this every single time I go (with maybe one or two exceptions); it's always perfect and I haven't gotten slightly tired of it in over three years!\n\nAnother favorite would be the Mexico Scramble (with chorizo, white cheddar, and salsa) which is absolutely delicious and dripping with goodness. I love their potatoes (especially the gooey, whole roasted cloves of garlic) but often choose salad instead for something light. Any of their miracle pancakes are incredible, and I have been dying to try the bread pudding ones but unfortunately these are (obviously) incredibly popular and I don't often make it in early enough! Their Oatmeal Brulee with bruleed bananas or French Toast Tahiti are both delightful sweet dishes.\n\nThis review is reaching book proportions, but I should mention their chai and espresso drinks come in giant bowls that are both impressive and delicious, though I am happy enough with just a cup of their drip coffee. \n\nLastly, the owner of Zazie is a wonderful woman who also came from waiting in the service industry and has worked hard to make sure her staff is taken good care of and know they are not just interchangeable. They all receive full benefits, dental, paid sick leave, 401k, and profit sharing. They recently made news by becoming the first restaurant in San Francisco to become tip free! While this may mean a slightly steeper price for each menu item, I for one am happily go out of my way to support and frequent a restaurant that cares about the \"little guy\" and makes sure we service industry workers are treated right and receive a truly livable wage.\n\nPS.

Gahhh so disappointed here... the food was quite good but the service definitely killed the good vibe =/\n\nI was really looking forward to brunch with one of my good friends, and when we arrived there weren't too many people so we didn't feel cramped. I ordered one poached egg (Pierre Noir) with bacon and tomatoes, and one gingerbread pancake. My friend ordered the French Toast Tahiti and one miracle pancake which happened to be poppy seed flavored. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant was cute but they put the tables very close together. Our waitress only came by to take our order and deliver our food; we had to flag her down for the check when it came time. The poached egg was whatever, it was super runny and the white didn't hold up very well for some reason. The bacon and tomatoes were good though. The gingerbread pancake was massive, and the lemon curd on top was pretty tasty; you don't really need the syrup because it's already sweet. I tried a bit of my friend's french toast which was yummy with the caramelized banana, and her poppyseed pancake was tasty too, I actually kind of liked it more than my gingerbread. \n\nAfter we finished our food our waitress brought our check, and it had a fee to pay for the workers benefits which was around $3. Okay, I wasn't aware of this at the beginning of the meal but I was willing to deal with it because hey, it's to help the staff out. BUT THEN I saw that they tacked on 20% TIP for TWO people. WTF. My friend and I wanted to split the bill between our two cards, so when the waitress came back I mentioned we wanted to split the balance, then add tip later. She said this wasn't possible and we had to pay the full 20% (I thought tip was voluntary so what the heck?!). She also failed to run my debit card so I had to use a different card which was annoying. \n\nI don't appreciate being told how much to tip, especially when it's only a party of two, the waitress didn't come by to ask us if we needed anything, and it's BREAKFAST for goodness sake.

Alright, lets get talking about this cute place!\n\nAMBIANCE/CUSTOMER SERVICE: I met my friend there, since she knew about the super long wait. Giving the place 4 stars because we ended up waiting 1 and a half hours all together. It was a super hot day too, so it wasn't enjoyable waiting for our table in the hot sun with little to no shade available. However, we rejoiced as our name was called and we were led to the back patio. It's beautiful there! With greenery and cute tables, I seriously loved the ambiance. Once seated, we got menus and out waiter asked us for beverage choices. I got an orange juice, which was delicious. However, it was a very small size for what I paid for. Waiter was extremely  friendly, and very helpful when I asked questions about the menu. My friend decided on getting the Albert Poached Eggs, while I got the French Toast Tahiti (2 pcs). The wait wasn't too long, probably around 25 minutes. When the food came out, I was amazed. Our plates looked like something from a dream, it was beautiful! \n\nTASTE/FOOD QUALITY: My friend loved her poached eggs. I had a bite, and it was to die for. Eggs were perfect, and the home fries were delicious. My french toast was amazing. I still dream about it sometimes. It was so decadent and sweet. Loved the caramelized bananas on top, with the walnuts. Can't recommend it enough, if you have a sweet tooth, like me. The french toast had a nice crisp on the outside, but was soft as a pillow when I cut my fork to snag a piece. The portions were generous, and I was so full when I was done. The quality of the food was great, loved it.\n\nOverall, this is a spectacular brunch spot. The waiting situation is something to be expected, since it is a very popular spot (and for a good reason!). The food is great, and prices are more on the moderate side.

Oh, and the side of potatoes comes with huge unpeeled roasted garlic pieces, of which you are not supposed to eat the peels. Well, you could try, but you'll spit them right back out, like I did.\n\nOur third choice, which I wish we had skipped, was the FLIGHT OF PANCAKES, which comes with one of each of their pancakes: miracle, gingerbread, and buttermilk, $14 (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j40Ikbetb3Q3x-WURnK2Ig/l.jpg). Not only were we full from the other dishes, but the pancakes were all dense and dry. The buttermilk pancake was decent, but I couldn't help but equate it to my Krusteaz mix at home. Now, add a dollop of the raspberry jam on your table, and you've got yourself a winner. That jam is like crack! The gingerbread pancake was notably thick and heavy with subtle ginger tones. The stewed pear outshines the pancake by far. And the miracle pancake tasted a LOT like cornbread and definitely needed the lemon curd for flavor. The first few bites were offsetting, but after I readjusted my perspective, I decided that this was the tastiest cornbread I had ever had. Also, their maple syrup was less viscous than expected and not overpoweringly sweet.\n\nService was spot on, and water refills were frequent. They add a surcharge of $1.25 per person to all checks to provide full benefits for the staff, which totaled to a little over $20 per person for a divine breakfast. If that extra bit of money is what it takes to guarantee accommodating and prompt wait staff, I'd suggest the policy at every restaurant.\n\nSkip the pancakes. Get the French Toast Tahiti and some type of Eggs Benedict.

As I was waiting by the kitchen for the restroom, I talked to the chefs as I kept seeing dishes that looked awesome and they were really nice and told me what everything was and what was in it.\n- Love love love that you can order just one slice of French toast/ pancake/ egg. It's slightly more pricey but you get to try so much more off the menu without filling yourself to the brim.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- A little on the pricey side, especially if you order a single toast/ pancake/ egg etc. (we did that and it was $21 before tax & tip). But... kinda worth it.\n\nWe ordered.. \n\n* Monaco Poached Egg (w/ prosciutto & tomatoes provencales) - WOW I had no idea I could love eggs benedict so much! I'm totally a sweet (vs. savory) brunch person, but surprisingly in this meal I liked this dish the most. Crispy, almost burnt English muffin + salty chewy prosciutto + tart squishy tomato = all of your sense are flipping out. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti (w/ caramelized bananas) - Incredibly soft, chewy, moist. Really great. However (Miss French Toast here - this is so my thing at brunch) it was really lacking that slight crunch on the outside of the bread. And the caramelized bananas had a kind of odd bitter aftertaste - I found myself putting it on the side so it wouldn't ruin the flavor on each bite of French toast.\n\n* Gingerbread Pancakes (w/ lemon curd & roasted pears)- Oh my god the flavor was wonderful! Very strong but it went perfectly with the combination of sweet maple syrup + tart lemon curd + pear. It was super thick and almost cake-like, fluffy yet dense. However (me being picky again) I found it just a tad too dry - I couldn't handle a single bite without dipping the pancake in syrup or the lemon curd to make it moist.

I guess it just goes to show you how delicious it was. The french toast had crispy, crunchy edges and was soft and moist inside. Yum.\n- Croque Madame: I had a bite of this and it was awesome. The Gruy\u00e8re was oozing out of the sandwich and the egg on top was the finishing touch. \n- New York (scrambled egg): the smoked salmon with egg was soo delish and the cream cheese was an unexpected yummy surprise. Super creamy and fresh!\n- Florentine (poached egg): the mushrooms and spinach in the muffin had great flavor and their hollandaise sauce was light and lemony. I was trying to soak everything, especially the poached eggs, in my biscuit!\n\nI also love that you can order one, two, or three slices of toast or egg, because it becomes so much easier to accommodate those who eat more or less.

I took off a star for bad service, 1 for stingy portions, and minus 1/2 for false advertising on the corn cakes). \n\nWhen I arrived, a waitress immediately told me that the patio was full and to get on the waiting list.  As soon as I put my name down, the host walked up to me and escorted us to the back patio where there were 5 empty tables.  It wasn't a big deal but the waitress should have double checked before telling me that there were no tables available.  Let's just say she set the tone for the entire experience.  \n\nThe food had hits and misses.  I ordered the St. Trop Benedict with wild smoked salmon, capers, and onion on an English muffin.  The egg was poached just the way how I like my eggs, with the yolk still runny.   While the portion was enough for my small appetite, it was really really really small compared to the Benedict I've had elsewhere.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=oDWEBuBPPpq4a8sGEt9Jdg\n\nMy friend didn't enjoy the Eggs en Fonte at all.  The ingredients in the dish sounded delicious but it was poorly made.  It was supposed to be housemade sweet corn cakes topped with 2 fried eggs, avocados, salsa fresca, and sour cream that was baked in an iron skillet.  The corn cakes were nowhere to be found.  The order came out with 2 over easy runny eggs and not the medium done eggs that he requested.  There was too much salsa on it.  The whole thing was mushy and runny like soup.  The waiter also forgot to ask my friend if he wanted home fries or salad that came with his order.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=IgtZ4ezH6AxV7WdZlF6rtA\n\nThe redeeming thing we had was the French toast Tahiti. Again the portion was an issue.  2 slices of thick French toast stuffed with mashed up caramelized banana and walnuts but the serving was only half of the sandwich.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=TX4RFDBXKEEEMMQXoihInA", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We all ordered various dishes, including yogurt with fruit, French Toast Tahiti (one slice was very large - was very sweet with not enough bananas), Eggs Saint Trop (came with salmon - friend liked it "], "author": "Caroline K.", "review": "Got here around 11 a.m. for sunday brunch and got seated right away.

It's a common style scramble you see at a lot of other breakfast restaurants, but Zazie takes it to another level. I asked for hot sauce or Tabasco for the scramble, and they came back with a small jar of the homemade stuff. Awesome. I almost wanted to drink it straight up. The home fries are awesomely exceptional. Each serving is complemented by cloves of roasted garlic. I've had many a home fries in my days around the country and these are simply the best I've ever had.

The beaufriend and I eat there every time I'm in SF, and it's a quick walk from the Haight St area. To be honest, I'd travel to get here.\n\nAs a vegetarian I haven't strayed from what I ate the first time: eggs florentine and skillet potatoes. The hollandaise is easily the best I've ever had. Just the right amount of lemon, and not heavy. The waiter brought us more upon request the last time we ate there. \n\nMy companion always gets one of the styles of eggs \"benedict\" and always asks for avocado on top. They always oblige, even though the menu says they don't accommodate substitutions. \n\nThe last time we went, we ordered 2 slides of the French Toast Tahiti, made with challah, supposedly from some bakery nearby though I'm not sure which. When we went around Thanksgiving, they were completely out of the challah for the weekend, so it was disappointing they hadn't planned ahead for the bakery's closing for the holiday.\n\nThe organic coffee is great, but I wish they would provide soy milk for creamer (at least ask ahead of time). \n\nThe host (always the same guy in a zip-up athletic jacket every time I've been there) plays favorites. He'll let his friends (?) in when they're much farther down the list. Also, he once seated the two of us at a booth for 4. I even told him we didn't mind waiting for a small table so that a larger group could use the space, but he shrugged and walked away.

Unfortunately, I was seated directly below the heat lamp so I felt like I was a piece of KFC chicken under a warming lamp.  \n\nI ordered the French Toast Tahiti. It was pretty good.  The description stated that it had caramelized walnuts, but I only found 2.  =(  I recommend ordering the two piece as it was very filling and I didn't even finish it.  But then again, for a guy, I can't eat that much.  \n\nWifey ordered the La Mer.  She let me try a bite and I must admit, it was delicious!  Soooo good!  It's basically a poached egg dish with Dungeness crab with avocado.  Seemed like she liked it a lot.\n\nTips:\n\n1.  Parking is very difficult.  Either take the N line in because it stops right next to it or prepare to circle around and around looking for parking.  \n\n2.

Plainly, it's not worth the wait or the crowd. Simply put, go somewhere else - you're not missing out. \n\nMy biggest beef with the food is that it's all too prepared.

All were quite good. \n\nThe pancakes were a tad dense, the pears added nothing special and the lemon curd didn't complete the flavors well. A fine pancake dish, but I've had better.\n\nThe french toast tahiti was fine as well. It's a bit more interesting, and indeed may be among the better french toasts I've had, but still lacked a depth/complexity that some simple modifications could have provided.\n\nThe home fries were good. I loved the cloves of garlic and the overall composition of the dish. The major problem here was execution: it was erratic and uneven. The cloves sometimes had skins that couldn't be chewed, but otherwise had ones cooked through. Likewise, the potatoes ranged from barely-finished to burnt. Not attentive cooking here. \n\nOn the whole, no major complaints.

I like how you can get 1, 2 or 3 slices of big fatty toast. It's one slice of bread, walnut paste, bread, bananas, etc. Comes with a side of syrup which honestly doesn't need to be used b/c this dish was flavorful enough.\n\nCROQUE MADAME\nThis was somewhat messy. The cheese was a bit on the watery side so it was hard to cut my sandwich and keep it a sandwich. It soon turned into a pile of bread, cheeses, ham, and runny egg. It was still good. I didn't even bother touching the side of greens on my plate. \n\nBENEDICTS\nI believe Zazie is the only place I know of in SF where you can get 1, 2 or 3 benedicts. THREE?? HELL YEAH. Three of my buds ordered 3 different kinds and ended up swapping. I was able to try three kinds: ALBERT (bacon, white cheddar, salsa), MONACO (prosciutto and tomatoes), and the LA MER (crab, avos, green onions). \n\nALBERT - The bacon was definitely very flavorful and thus took over the taste of the benedict. Nonetheless, it was still good.\nMONACO - the prosciutto was a bit chewy but I think this was the best benedict. The flavors of the prosciutto wasn't over powering and everything went well together.\nLA MER - Bland!! Since the hollandaise sauce is a light lemoney sauce, this definitely did not help that the crab wasn't very flavorful, and the fact that avos don't really have much of a taste to it. This was just mushy from the avos and sauce, and stringy from the crab.\n\n7x7.com states that you have to have a benedict at Zazie before you die, but I honestly beg to differ. The poached eggs on the la mer benedict was overdone. It wasn't runny at all. We should have had them change it but we already waited so long for food we didn't really care. The hollandaise sauce for the benedicts could have been a tad bit more flavorful, but I do appreciate how it wasn't overpowering. \n\nAll in all, Zazie is a good place to come to brunch if you want to control the portions you eat for breakfast since you an order 1, 2 or 3 pieces of french toast and same goes with benedicts.

Mere blocks from the far more colorful Haight Ashbury neighborhood, Zazie is surrounded by wholesome little shops and town houses. People actually have babies/young children in this area (gasp). \n\nThe food is phenomenal whether you're an egg or carb-oriented breakfaster. I am equally obsessed with the fontainbleu egg scramble and the french toast tahiti (sinfully decadent - its stuffed with carmelized bananas and walnuts). I've also sampled and enjoyed the gingerbread pancakes (topped with roasted pears) and the Valence poached eggs. \n\nThe menu's best feature: most items are available in quantities of one, two and three - this goes for french toast, pancakes, and the multiple poached eggs variations. When my brunch companions and I have been particularly hungry or just feeling indulgent, we'll often get a single pancake or slice of french toast as a \"side\" in addition to our entrees. Conversely, it is also a good option for cost conscious brunchers. \n\n$$ and the long wait seem to be the two primary concerns about this spot, and I'd like to weigh in on both. With respect to cost, my personal philosophy is that brunch is invariably a good deal because you're getting two meals (breakfast and lunch) for the price of one. Even better, this form of justification/denial is equally applicable to food consumption - calories are spread out over two meals. (Yay loopholes!)\n\nAs for the wait, I've been here a bazillion times and have never waited for over 30 minutes. Maybe it's luck, but there's also a surprisingly well kept secret: the tables on the sidewalk are first come, first serve, so if it's a nice day put your name on the list and stake out the diners nearest to finishing. Also, dining in smaller parties helps (especially in twos), as tables for larger groups are limited. But alas, if you do have to wait, the Zazie host couldn't be nicer and remembers all regulars by sight and even name. \n\nI'd like to end this rambling review with an image that I believe is testament to Zazie's greatness. For a few weeks in the spring, Zazie closed for renovations. Being rather slow in the morning, I forgot this and showed up only to find the interior dark and a notice on the door. But it was worth the trip just to see the thousands of post-it notes from forlorn patrons that papered Zazie's windows, begging it to reopen soon.

Everything is excellent, but a bit too crowded and loud at brunch on weekends. But that's the point isn't it? Best place to go with hangover, and a great force to make sure you get up early on weekends and get there 10 minutes before 9. \n\n5) The owner loved me, so did the dishwashers.\n\nBrunch food:\n1) French Toast Tahiti: perfectly prepared french toasts, thick, fluffy, but heavenly soft. Caramelized banana adds the creamy texture, and the walnuts adds the crunchy kick. Nice and filling, yet not heavy.\n\n2) Gingerbread pancake: incredibly spongy and flavorful pancakes with a touch a lemon cream on top. Very yummy. Try it with the raspberry jam on the table. Much try at Zazie, and you'll see why it's always on the menu.\n\n3) Lemon Ricotta pancake: not the best I've tried. The best lemon ricotta cake that I've had is believe it or not, at the bar Feve in Oberlin Ohio. The cakes are too heavy, and a bit lack of flavor. The first one I got was not cooked through that tasted like the batter. Cookie dough is yummy, but not the pancake batter. Sent it back, got a better one, but still nicht so gute.\n\n4) Eggs Italie: scrambled eggs with tomatoes, cream cheese, and basil. Use your imagination. It's a great combination with good preparation. I personally make better scrambles with some pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. But Zazie cooks my brunch and takes care of the dishes, why not?\n\n3) Eggs Florentine: Best Egg benedict besides Chef and Butler. It is traditional and straight-forward. The Hollandaise is creamy but not heavy, doesn't leave the unpleasant stickiness in your mouth. Eggs perfectly poached. Bravo.\n\n6) The mimosa (grapefruit and something): not impressing at all. Couldn't finish it.\n\n7) Cappuccino: very very good, so good that I hate the fact that you can't have it refilled like a regular coffee.\n\nDinner:\n1) French Onion Soup: I would come here just for this bowl of dreams come true, especially at the end of a long tough day of 45 degrees. Very rich flavored soup, with bread crumbs that have still crunchy crust, OH MY GOD CRUNCHY CHEESY TOP.\n\n2) Salade Betterave: I love beets, and here you get 3 kinds of beets, green, gold, and red beets. I love fennels, and here you get fennels. Avocado and white gorgonzola vinegrette give the creamy texture. Yum. Everything I love thrown together, well balanced and light.\n\n3) Pate de Volaille: I hate liver of any animals. Just hate the taste. But, this one is AMAZING, like O.M.G. So smooth and creamy that just melt on your tongue, yes, THAT good. It doesn't have the nasty liver-y taste at all. One of our favorite dishes of the night. \n\n4) Mussels Marinieres: a little disappointed. The combination of white wine, shallots, parsley and cream is nice, very nice. But I don't like food that's \"slightly warm\", not cold, not warm, not hot, just slightly warm. It's not the best temperature to serve something creamy, I think.\n\n5) Lamb Tagine: braised lamb entree, looks much better on the menu than it tastes actually. Maybe just not my thing to throw everything together and serve it like a chinese congee. Not my favorite dish, but very well prepared I must say.\n\nDessert:\n1) Toasted Challah Bread Pudding: hands down, the best bread pudding in town, even slightly better than Tartine. Although it's not fair to compare 2 different ways of making bread pudding, I like it better at Zazie. I just love the variety of texture in the bowl, crunchy, creamy, bready, eggy, sweet, smooth, warm, but wow with the pumpkin spice icecream. Bravissimo!\n\n2) Cafe d'AUTOMNE: very interesting combination of Ciao bella Tahitian Vanilla bean and pumpkin icecream, pound cake crumbles, shot of espresso, whipped cream, and toasted almond. Interesting, but for some reason, it's just too much going on for me. But worth a try.\n\nTips: go with a group of people, like 4, get the sampler platter, choose 3  appetizers from the list of 6, and the dessert sampler platter choose 3 out of 7.

The roasted potatoes at Zazie weren't bad, a 3 star rating, but if you are looking for my definition of homefries, you'll be disappointed with Zazie's potatoes.\n\nThe Challah French Toast was another miss for me, a borderline 3 rating.  Challah is usually a great choice of bread for French toast but the bread didn't absorb the egg enough for me, and the French toast, though not bad, didn't have any distinguishable flavoring or unique taste that would motivate me to order again.   \n\nThe French Toast Tahiti was very good, a solid 4 star rating.  The French Toast Tahiti is stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.  The caramelized bananas are particularly delicious.  I would recommend ordering a full order of the French Toast Tahiti and skipping the \"homefries\" and Challah French Toast.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-11-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I've also had their French Toast Tahiti (I think that was the name) -- french toast \"stuffed\" with carmelized bananas and walnuts.

While they weren't really stuffed (more like, put between two pieces of french toast), it was still quite tasty.  Although, I realize that I prefer savory for breakfast (but it just sounded sooo good).\n\nI subtracted one star b/c my eggs over medium were really eggs over easy.  There was even uncooked egg white, which kinda grossed me out.  I'm almost tempted to subtract another star for their slow service and long waits.  But the service, while slow, was still pleasant, and all good brunch spots seem to have ridiculously long waits these days (or rather, years?  I thought the dot-com bubble burst in '01 was going to bring us back to normal brunch waits; ***sigh***).\n\nUPDATE:  So, after writing this review, the owner writes me a very nice note.  I write her back and mention that the next time I go, I'll say hello.  \n\nI went again Presidents' Day Monday.  Things were quite busy, and I think the owner was working as the hostess.  I was going to say hello, but our service that day was just so bad, I didn't even feel like bothering. \n\nOur waitress was totally absent -- she never checked in on us, we had to keep looking for her to come outside again and then flag her down (can we get menus?  can I get another mimosa?  can we get more coffee?  hot sauce?  extra hollandaise?).  She never asked how our food was or else they would've gotten the feedback that there wasn't any hollandaise sauce (ok, maybe just a wee bit) on my boyfriend's poached eggs (albert) and that my poached egg was cooked hard (st. trop).\n\nEven if our service was terrible, our food was still pretty good (once we got the extra hollandaise, and I just got over the fact that if I wanted a new poached egg, I'd probably be waiting forever for it...  way past after my boyfriend would be done with his breakfast...).\n\nRelatedly, my boyfriend's sister went to Zazie for lunch last week and also had terrible service and terrible food (I only remember she'd mentioned cold toast brought with butter, which she wasn't able to spread).  So, I think this may be our last trip to Zazie for a while...  which I must admit I'm a little sad about b/c I do like their eggs...  but it's no good to leave brunch on a beautiful day feeling pissy b/c of your service.

The space is decorated with posters of the French movie character, Zazie. There are a few tables next to the front window which have excellent views. There is also a heated outdoor patio. I've been here for dinner and weekend brunch. \n1.) Dinner\nDinner was definitely less hectic than brunch. We came on a Sunday evening, early, around 5 and were able to get a table immediately. The service was incredibly slow. We had been there nearly an hour before the waiter delivered a basket of hot rolls, fresh from the oven. We then shared a french onion soup that was made with beef broth, bread, and gruyere cheese. The onions in the soup gave it a sweet flavor. Next came a beet salad (marinated beets with anise), avocado, with baby lettuce and a gorgonzola white balsamic vinagrette. Not as good as the beet salad at Olivia, but certainly palatable. The last course on our dinner menu was polenta cakes with marscapone, red pepper cream sauce, portabello mushrooms and spinach. A very busy dish, with competing intense flavors, but worked out in the end to please my tastbuds. So overall dinner was not bad. \n2.) Brunch\nI thought I would come back for brunch, since their french toast tahiti looked amazing (brioche with caramelized bananas and walnuts). Big mistake. The line was out the door, and once we got a table (took nearly an hour) they informed us that they were out of the brioche for the french toast. Okay, I thought, I'll get the pancakes instead. I asked for fruit on the side, to make up for the fact that I wasn't getting my banana french toast. In any event, they brought a huge stack of normal buttermilk pancakes (which I'll have to say were decent, but nothing special), but no fruit. Just syrup and jam. Way too starchy. And the waiter was gone (and made himself scarce) before I had a chance to complain. So I was not impressed with the brunch at Zazie, but am still waiting to try their french toast tahiti!\n3.) Brunch take 2\nWent to Zazie again for brunch today because I had a hair appointment at a nearby salon and figured if I was in the area, maybe this would be my lucky day and I would finally get to try the french toast tahiti.

You sign your name in and they will call your name when there are seats. I recommend coming here for a lunch date for 2 to 4 people. Seating is pretty small and mostly for 2. They can put tables together, but I'm sure the wait would be a little longer. The seating in the front of the restaurant is first come first serve, so you don't have to put your name down for it. Just grab the table as soon as you see someone get up. \n\nThe service is amazing. The staff always checked on us.  Boyfriend got a omelette. It was the special for the day. It was filled with sausage, mushrooms and some other things. I was too focused on my food to remember his. It was tasty though. Food wasn't too salty. The omelette did have a little run in the middle, but my boyfriend lives for that. I got the crab Benedict. It was delicious! You can ask for 1 or 2 eggs. It comes with a side of salad. They do not skimp you on the crab meat. It's pretty light and the salad goes really well, which left room for all the sweets I ordered. \n\nWe got French toast Tahiti and miracle pancakes.

People are OK with waiting over an hour for a foodporn benny or a special french toast...stuffed, sprinkled, or fried...whatever form it comes in. So excuse yourself if you can't handle this review. We waited an hour on Saturday brunch, which is typical for SF when you \"do brunch.\" That wasn't a problem, since I've waited over an hour at Plow in Potrero Hill before. But if you're a brunch spot with that long of a wait, you should be blowing my mind. Zazie was delicious and all sorts of French-cute, but the small portion sizes and our \"over it\" server was not the business.\n\nFor our two-top, we shared a single LA MER (crab) benny, which was disappointing. We paid $17 for a sad, small plate (pictured below)...at least fill the plate up with homefries so it kind of looks like it's worth $17. Our favorite was the special pumpkin miracle pancakes, which weren't too sweet...and topped with a scoop of real pumpkin on top. The special omelette that weekend was a great combo of squash, goat cheese (I don't usually like goat cheese, but it was a GREAT pairing) and greens. We were extremely satisfied with the food, but we felt like the La Mer wasn't worth the $17. ONE EGG doesn't cost that much, even though the egg price has risen recently.\n\nService is \"barely there,\" which is great if you're looking to chat with your brunch partner(s) and don't want any interruptions. Our dude was pretty chill, but being a server myself, I was glad that I didn't have to tip him for his lackluster performance. I hope Zazie's system of paying their employees a great wage is working out for them...this guy just didn't seem too pumped to be at work.\n\nLastly, their restrooms need more work. There's a tiny one wedged in the back of the house across from the kitchen window...so if there's a line (which there always is for women), then you'll find yourself standing in the space of the servers/kitchen/BOH, and just feeling in the way. This is probably an infrastructure detail they can't fix since SF is so tight for space. But it's not convenient.

Weekends are too crazy for me most of the time to get out and brunch it up, but many of the places I had bookmarked only offer brunch on weekends! Fortunately Zazie was one of the eateries open for brunch on a weekday. Zazies is a little gem, a shop on the smaller side, located in a cramped (what isn't cramped in SF) street along a hill. A friend and I went at about 12ish and there was a group of people outside waiting and a list full to the next page. Parking here is definitely a struggle, but luckily we snagged the spot right in front. It's cool that they offer the first come first serve seating right in front, in addition to a waitlist hanging on the window. Even though it looked like there were many people ahead of us on the waitlist, it went by really quickly! Our party of two was called over and man, everyone here is so friendly. Definitely one of the friendliest places I've been to! As soon as they see you walking ahead, theres someone holding the door open for you, every single employee you walk by greets you hello and goodbye, all genuinely friendly, warm smiles, and welcoming. Maybe they were lucky and just hired a great group of individuals, or their forward thinking no tip/better pay rule really makes them happier workers (which in that case, every shop should consider implementing this if they can!). \n\nSo we walk through the restaurant to get to the back patio and it's so cramped inside that my cheeks were definitely brushing against every person and table and chair. The outside patio is a tiny bit more spacious than inside, however I still had to move my chair every so often to let the person at the next table go in and out. We ended up ordering the New York scrambled eggs, 1 miracle pancake, and 1 french toast Tahiti. Normally I like to stay benedickin' during brunches (plus poached eggs make for better egg porn), but the cream cheese in the scrambled eggs was a deal breaker for us and we had no regrets. The cream cheese complimented the salmon and the soft scrambled eggs, so it was melt in your mouth goodness. The potatoes came with garlic which I loved, but they could definitely give more potatoes and a little less garlic. The french toast was also amazing! I loved that it was actually not too sweet at all. It was not a sugary sweet, but rather just a sweetness that came from the bananas. The miracle pancakes were a miss for us, however! The miracle pancakes are a special with a weekly flavor-this week is lemon ricotta pancakes with meyer lemon curd. Lemon curd sounded amazing, WHICH IT WAS, but then it also came with a raspberry sauce on it which was overly sweet and took away from the lemony flavors. We double checked the menu and on the ingredients, it didn't even say it would come with raspberry sauce! Because of preference, we just didn't like it, but what if we were allergic to it? It really should say so on the menu in the future so people won't be confused. \n\nAt the end of our meal we left feeling super stuffed and satisfied.

Read some reviews from fellow Yelpers about how getting to Zazie at 9am on Sunday (which it opens at 9 by the way) still ended up a one-hour wait, I decided this is not going to happen to me.\n\nArrived on Sunday 8:25am and got the first spot in line woohoo! (sorry for being silly but I sacrifice sleep time for good food and *relatively* efficient-er use of time) But Yelpers are right the lines get crazy pretty early - at 8:50am there were about 25-30 people already and clearly, once the restaurant opened it quickly filled up.\n\nA lot of research has been done before getting there. Quickly decided what I wanted. One thing I really like about their menu is that its flexible - for eggs you can choose 1 to 3 eggs and so do pancakes as well.\n\n#La Mer: A-.\nLa Mer is a poached-egg-on-muffin dish with dungeness crab meat. I ordered one egg only since I wanted to try many dishes. The poached egg was very nicely made - perfect temperature and texture. The lemon hollandaise with muffin and avocado worked great together as well. Crab meat on the other hand was a bit disappointing - quantity is very little and perhaps the hollandaise covered it (?) I couldn't really find the crab meat taste at all. I would go for other meat type (the prosciutto one?) next time.\n\nEach poached egg dish comes with a side - either home fries (more like potatoes) or salad. I don't know about the salad but GET THE HOME FRIES! It was so good and became highlight of the dish. The potatoes were perfectly grilled/fried and with a strong sense of garlic. In fact there was one piece of roasted garlic included (accidentally?) and it was super tasty even though I'm not really a eat-whole-piece-garlic of person. Wonderful!\n\n#French Toast Tahiti: A-.\nOrdered one toast for this. While the caramelized banana was simply within expectation, it was the walnuts filling that set a major difference. I'm a huge fan for walnut - the filling perfectly carried out the original walnut taste without being too sweet. The french toast itself was above average.\n\n#Gingerbread Pancake: B+.\nI usually like gingerbread a lot (e.g. the seasonal gingerbread latte from starbucks) and although this pancake did have a sense of gingerbread to it, I did not find it to be impressive. The texture of the pancake was fluffy and that was about it. But luckily the lemon curd saved it - it was so lemonish and this combination of lemon curd and pancakes was so brilliant.\n\nBeing a restaurant with thousands of good reviews I was expecting mediocre service - but not really.

Seems like a while, but with good company, it really isn't so bad! Also if you're a party of 2, make sure to watch for those 4 front tables. It's a first come, first serve basis, so you can just swoop the table when another party leaves and you don't have to wait on the list!\n\nAfter careful consideration, I ordered Eggs Guillame, which is an eggs benedict that comes with prosciutto and asparagus and home fries or salad. It was very hard to choose which benedict I wanted because they all sounded so good!!! But when the eggs guillame arrived and I got to try it, I was happy with my choice. The eggs were poached perfectly--like literally, perfect. The hollandaise was super tasty too even though i'm not used to it being so lemony. The earthy asparagus balanced out the salty prosciutto wonderfully and a bite of everything together was like a party in my mouth hahaha. I was also really impressed with the home fries. Usually I don't like breakfast potatoes that much, but they were crispy, hot, and garlicky! Garlic makes everything taste better. :P\n\nI also got to try some of the famous miracle pancakes and the Tahitian french toast. Both of them were heavenly!! I can't wait to come back and try them again. One of my friends also really enjoyed her omelette, which was on the special menu as well.

Our waiter was really friendly and nice about constantly bringing us water (#thirsty), and just very personable in general. When you interact with someone in such a good mood, you get in an even better mood!! Also when a different waiter brought over my benedict, one of the poached eggs fell over to the side so all the hollandaise was on the side of my plate. I guess he saw the disappointment on my face, so he brought me a small container of hollandaise so I could pour it over that egg myself!! :') Service like that is really great to see and makes you wanna come back.\n\nAlso, there is a $1.25 charge per person for the employees health benefits and 401(k)'s.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "The SF brunch scene is too real at Zazie: the name alone conjures dazzling connotations.  Add patio seating, unique presentation on a floral plate, a menu with gingerbread and miracle pancakes, plus the proximity to the UCSF campus heavily populated by twentysomethings addicted to brunch and propagating the pandemic on Instagram--well I am exaggerating slightly--you get an extremely popular brunch place that ends up on everyone's bucket list.  (I admit to being guilty of all of the above.)\n\nTo avoid the long wait, I would suggest going on a weekday or early on a weekend (emphasis on early if you have a large group, since the place is quite small).  On weekends, Bambino's next door is a good alternative for a backup; you just have to be okay with the more traditional name that may remind you of Bambi, and the more traditional vibe.\n\nBefore you get inpatient with my review, let me get to the food P:  Like all fancy SF brunch places, the price range is $10-$20 for a decent entree, but I do like how there are different portion options.  The pancakes, waffles, and poached eggs come in 1, 2, or 3; I suggest 1 for breakfast, maybe 2 for brunch if you are really hungry.  After doing my extensive Yelp research and getting excited over the eggs en fonte (yes, the presentation on a cast iron skillet was a factor), I was a bit disappointed when I asked about this and they said they didn't have it that day.  \n\nI went for the French Toast Tahiti ($7 for one piece), stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.  It tasted both like heaven and hyperglycemia at the same time: already-sweet-by-definition French toast, this sweet and nutty walnut paste, caramelized bananas that were sweeter than fried plantains, a drizzle of syrup.  And, if that's not bad enough, a sprinkle of powdered sugar to look extra pretty in photos.  And, to make things even worse, there is a little cup of syrup to be added PRN, but I felt like the dish was already sweet to saturation.   Sweetness complaints aside, I enjoyed my French toast--it had a good fluffy texture, was not too thick and egg-yolky, and was very tasty with the walnut sauce and bananas.  The only catch was that after trying the caramelized bananas here, I was unable to eat normal bananas for like a week afterwards because it tasted bland in comparison to the caramelized and syrupy version at Zazie's.\n\nThe ambiance is European with a bit of a quaint, small-town feel.  Somehow I'm not surprised at their quaisi-modernist-hipster elements like the water in tall aesthetic glass bottles and baked eggs served in a skillet.  The servers are friendly, similar to what you'd expect at a family-owned restaurant.  My only dissatisfaction was how upset the waitress got when I asked her to take a picture for us on my dSLR and she was confused about how to look through the viewfinnder.. if your hipster games goes strong to dSLR-level, make sure you set the screen to electronic viewfinder in order to avoid the awkwardness of my situation.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-12-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The miracle pancakes are even better.

I wanted the crab one, but crab season was over, so I went with the Monaco, which was a proscuitto and tomato provanceles.

The cream cheese, red onions and capers worked well with the salmon and the drizzle of hollandaise sauce as well.  We thought it was a little odd that cooked pieces of garlic with the peels on were thrown on to our plate with the home fries.

"], "author": "Brittany C.", "review": "This place is so hyped up, so why am I even bothering to write a review? I'll be honest, it's mostly because I think it's worth pointing out that (as of June 2015) they have a really great no-tipping policy. According to their menu, \"Our menu prices include a living wage, profit sharing, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid sick leave, and a 401(k) with employer match for all our hard working employees.\" Definitely something I'm down to stand behind, considering how broken the system of tipping is in America. Props to Zazie for being willing to raise prices in order to build in a fair wage and benefits for their employees.\n\nNo-tipping policy aside, Zazie serves up a pretty great brunch. You can tell by the lines on weekends that brunch here is serious business. Don't be scared off, though, the line moves fairly fast (probably averages an hour wait for 2-4 people), and the host is crazy efficient with the process: they really know how to run a brunch place in SF. Plus, there's a Peet's next door so you can grab coffee while you wait...but don't stray too far, they don't seat you until the whole party is there!\n\nAnyway, enough about the lines, here's some tips (see what I did there?) about the food: Zazie is best experienced with friends. And by that I mean, grab a friend or two and split a few dishes, some savory and some sweet, so you can get the best of both brunch worlds. My personal favorites:\n- Eggs La Mer: In simpler terms, this is a Crabs Eggs Benedict, and it is amazing. Everything you love about crab and avocado and poached eggs in one fantastic combination. Also comes with a side of deliciously well-seasoned home fries.\n- If you're into spice, ask for the house-made hot sauce: It's really spicy and will give everything a nice kick!\n- Gingerbread Pancakes: I'm not particularly into gingerbread, but this is dish is really, really good. The pancakes are soft and thick and fluffy, and the light gingerbread flavor goes really well with the poached pears and butter. It melts in your mouth in the best way.\n\nA friend once described this place as \"a San Francisco staple\" and I completely understand why.

Unfortunately, the backyard dining area was still closed since it was in the process of drying off from the earlier precipitation.\n\nOur waitress was a cheerful and smiling gal. The atmosphere was cute and decorated with small French posters. Seating was sorta cramped. I heard more than enough of the conversations at the adjacent tables. A man at one of tables next to us had one of those voices that jabbed right into our ear canals, annoying.\n\nThe organic signature tea ($4.95) was my selection for a beverage. I thought it was for one person, but it came out in a big silver pot and was the gift that kept giving. So I would recommend it for two or more people. Thankfully you can get a to-go cup for the rest! It kind of reminds me of Sleepytime tea, wish the apricot flavor were stronger however.\n\nMy brother and I decided to share the gingerbread pancakes and the St. Trop and La Mer Benedicts. Each pancake is pretty substantial. We both loved these cakes of the pan! The lemon curd is such a wonderful complement, and the roasted pear looks like a potato but is lovely. Squeeze the orange wedge for a little extra citrus taste. And the syrup adds the just perfect touch of sweetness.\n\nYou can get one, two, or three eggs with your Benedicts, and you have your choice of home fries or salad. It was tough to decide which Benedict was better. We liked them both equally! I joked that we got West Coast ones and East Coast ones since the salmon, capers, and onions reminded me of NYC bagel accoutrements.\n\nThe kitchenside bathroom was an adventure. You pull the door closed, but it doesn't close completely. Since I had to wait to use it, I occupied my time by staring at a tremendous tower of bacon in a pan and spied on some naked Benedicts getting clothed.\n\nZazie's been penciled in for a return brunch when I'm back in the city!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-05-28"}, {"excerpts": ["- Gingerbread pancakes - 3.5 stars - exactly what it sounds like, pancakes with a gingerbread taste lol.

The lemon curd dollop along with the pear slice was out of this world as the sweet tangy flavor of the lemon curd is from Meyer lemons I would bet, and the sweetness of pear is just killer.

My favorites by far are the La Mer and the St. Trop. The La Mer has a generous portion of fresh crab meat, most of which is in large pieces, and three small slices of avocado. The St. Trop has fresh, thin-sliced smoked salmon that is melt in your mouth silky and delicious! I'm not a big fan of raw onions and capers, so I liked how those two ingredients' tastes were very mild. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the Monaco because I thought the tomato flavor was overwhelming and I could barely taste the prosciutto, which is surprising because it's cured meat! The Benedict's eggs are poached perfectly, coming out nice and runny. The lemon hollandiase sauce is very mild and not too heavy, but they don't give enough of it.\n\nI'd avoid using their bathroom. It's literally the size of an airplane bathroom, if not smaller. You can hit the sink trying to stand up (ladies, and men too for #2).

I also like indulging in things like chicken fried steak, corned beef hash and buttermilk biscuits w/ gravy. Cardiac Arrest is usually what I order for breakfast because there's nothing like starting your day with a heart-stopping, artery clogging delicious meal. \n\nFortunately for me, I rarely eat breakfast. Shame on me, I know. However, I usually wake up with just enough time to sh*t, shave and shower before heading out the door for work. \n\nLet me paint you my first and only Zazie experience. My gf and I met up with three of our friends in the city. We got to Zazie at 2:15pm this past Saturday and there was a horde of people waiting outside. For a place famous for its breakfast/brunch, I was extremely surprised patrons were still lining up well after lunch time. We put our name down after the host told us it would only be a 30 minute way. I didn't believe him but he proved me wrong. We were seated at 2:45pm.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a table in the back patio. It's quaint, cozy and perfect for a sunny day. The girls loved it. I was hungry. Sh*t was about to get real. \n\nI looked over the menu to find that it didn't have my typical heart stoppers. Chicken fried steak, where are you? Corned beef hash, show yourself! Instead, Zazie's menu was littered with exotic scrambles, lovely benedicts, power pancakes, soups, salads, sandwiches and other typical brunchy items. \n\nEGGS DIVORCE ~ 3 stars: Not listed on the menu. This was a special that day. Sitting on top of each toasted English muffin was a poached egg, fontina cheese, avocado slices, bacon and \"fabulous\" lemon hollandaise. Like all scrambles and benedicts, you can order 1, 2 or 3 eggs. I went with 3 and got a side of home fries... Told you sh*t was gonna get real. The hollandaise sauce was good, but I wouldn't call it fabulous. It was pretty standard which doesn't make it a bad thing. It just tasted like typical hollandaise. The benedict was good but not great. Honestly, It tasted exactly like I expected. It didn't blow my mind. However, I really enjoyed the homefries that came with roasted garlic cloves. It's weird, garlic isn't something you ever put in your breakfast, but Zazie made it work with the potatoes. Nice touch. \n\nMONACO ~ 2.5 stars: My gf got this. Poached egg, hollandaise, prosciutto, tomatoes provencales on top of an English muffin. She kept it cool and only got 1. I tried it and it wasn't great. In my opinion, you should never get benedict with prosciutto because it gets lost in the yolk, muffin and hollandaise. Why get something if you can't even taste it? \n\nBEET SALAD w/ GOAT CHEESE ~ 4 stars: Nice salad. The beets were cooked perfectly and the dressing wasn't too heavy. \n\nGINGERBREAD PANCAKES ~ 3 stars: Before you get loco on my ass, let me explain. I don't like pancakes. I don't like waffles. I don't like anything sweet for the first meal of my day. It just doesn't fly with me. However, if you like pancakes, this is something you have to try. After sampling a bite, I can see why so many people love this menu item. It will absolutely satisfy your sweet tooth and tummy. \n\nSABE SAKE VODKA BLOODY MARY~ 4 stars: An excellent Bloody Mary with great flavor. I wish it was a bit thicker but other than that, it was almost perfect. \n\nOne of our friends ordered a scramble and another got something else. I didn't try either one so I can't say anything about it. However, the scramble looked really good. \n\nI wasn't blown away by Zazie. The food was ok, not great. However, I think the ambiance is fantastic. \n\nWould I ever go back? Probably not...

Total YUMMINESS...\n\nEvoking the texture of a sponge cake, the large gingerbread pancake was light, fluffy and soft.

The eggs were perfectly scrambled to fluffy chiffon yellow clouds intertwined with loads of smoked salmon and whipped cream cheese; a good balance of salty, savory, smoky and creamy!

Nonetheless, it was still good. \n\nThe scramble came with home fries and your choice of toast, but I steered away from because as I wanted to waste my carbs on the pancake. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nThe service at Zazie's reminded me more of your typical diner than a bistro; fast but with a lack of personality. After ordering, our food arrived promptly within 7-8 minutes. After receiving our food, I don't remember our waiter ever checking in with us after that. I liked that a glass water bottle was provided on our table so we could refill our glasses at our own leisure without having to bother the wait staff. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R:\nA cozy and small French bistro with a touch of funkiness from the bright yellow and rustic brick walls, French posters, white-tiled flooring and a narrow metal spiral stair case leading to the loft area.

Crispy, almost burnt English muffin + salty chewy prosciutto + tart squishy tomato = all of your sense are flipping out. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti (w/ caramelized bananas) - Incredibly soft, chewy, moist. Really great. However (Miss French Toast here - this is so my thing at brunch) it was really lacking that slight crunch on the outside of the bread. And the caramelized bananas had a kind of odd bitter aftertaste - I found myself putting it on the side so it wouldn't ruin the flavor on each bite of French toast.\n\n* Gingerbread Pancakes (w/ lemon curd & roasted pears)- Oh my god the flavor was wonderful! Very strong but it went perfectly with the combination of sweet maple syrup + tart lemon curd + pear. It was super thick and almost cake-like, fluffy yet dense. However (me being picky again) I found it just a tad too dry - I couldn't handle a single bite without dipping the pancake in syrup or the lemon curd to make it moist. I wish I could enjoy the great ginger flavor of the pancake alone.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-02-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Although I love savory brunch food, their gingerbread pancakes with bosc pear and lemon curd is to die for; fluffy, gingery, sweet and tart all at once.

We ordered a ton of food for only ~$20/person.  There are those typical \"breakfast / brunch places\" and then there are those fabulous breakfast/brunch places that make you realize how much you LOVE breakfast foods like eggs (poached, scrambled, omelet-style), bacon, ham, Eggs Benedict, bagels, toast, sandwiches, juice and oatmeal.  \n\nI had been getting into a sad rut where I loved breakfast foods but had not found a place that really showcased such breakfast items in a way that justified spending $12 on eggs and carbs and also make me think, \"WOW.\"  Zazie changed that with their hearty yet delicate lunch that was delicious through and through!  :)\n\nGINGERBREAD PANCAKES (4/5):  Light and delicious, the flavor of the gingerbread pancakes were brought out by a sweet lemon curd along with a slice of caramelized pear.  YUM.  A stack of 2 gingerbread pancakes will easily feed a table of four.\n\nTAHITI FRENCH TOAST (5/5):  Yes, it's that good!  The french toast was huge and buttery soft and paired perfectly with walnut cream and caramelized strips of banana.  SO exquisite and delicious.  This French Toast doesn't make you feel like you're just eating filler carbs because this is a great dish in its own right. A definite must order with your brunch entree.\n\nEGGS BENEDICT (5/5):  Whatever you order (the Floretine, Pierre Noire, the Albert), the poached eggs are huge and perfect!  The eggs benedict made me fall in love with breakfast all over again.  The poached eggs had the perfect consistency (not overdone, a little runny, held its perfect little shape on top of the English muffin, tomatoes and bacon). \n\nThe roasted potatoes and garlic that accompany the egg dishes are delicious.  The potatoes are a little oily but there's some kind of intense, robust flavor that makes it hard to stop eating the potatoes and doesn't make you feel like you're just eating those typical roasted rosemary potatoes.  You really feel like you're eating a hearty, flavorful breakfast that someone took a lot of thought into preparing.  So good!  You can choose from 1 to 2 to 3 eggs at different prices ($9 / 12 / 16 (i think)).\n\nSANDWICHES (4/5):  Very good as well!  We had the sandwich with a fried egg, ham, melted cheese and a side salad of mixed greens.  The sandwich is very good, but we found ourselves going to the eggs benedict more.  I think my friends had a delicious ahi tuna sandwich-- will definitely try that next time. \n\nWAIT:  We waited for approximately 30-40 minutes on a Sunday at 1 p.m.  The wait dies down significantly by 2 p.m., but that's because the restaurant closes at 2:30 p.m.  This place is worth the wait- you won't be disappointed. \n\nUNIQUE:  Zazie is an affordable and unique local gem that embraces SF's \"go green\" mentality and features a delicious brunch that'll have you talking about it the entire day (no joke!).  Zazie has two outdoor seating tables in front of the restaurant, a handful of wooden tables indoors and a beautiful backyard/patio seating area outside.  \n\nCUTE:  Everything about this place is great!  Zazie has super cute, painted plates and a comfortable (and comforting) feel to the restaurant.  You'll find yourself spending over an hour or two eating and chatting with friends without even knowing it!  There's homemade jam (slightly sweet and tart) on the table as well.\n\nMIMOSA:  The mimosa drinks looked delicious.  They had a fresh mango mimosa that I would definitely try. (Reminds me of what The Grape Leaf Inn served in Napa.)\n\nDINNER:  The dinner at Zazie looks pretty darn good, especially since they pair it with community-friendly outreach-type incentives like no corkage-fee nights, dog-friendly nights and prie fix menues for ~$28.

I've been wanting to visit and try you for so long, and today I finally got to. \n\nEver since I went on a Brunch craze a couple months ago, I wanted to find somewhere in the Bay Area to try. Zazie's reviews caught my eye, and the menu made it a definite that I wanted to visit someday. The timing was never right, but this week while my girlfriend was in town for New York City, we decided to try it out. Before heading to Zazie, I already knew what I wanted to try (definitely did my menu and review researching before, there's so many options and I want to be sure to try the best ones). \n\nMy friend and I ordered the French Toast Tahiti, Gingerbread Pancakes, La Mer (poached eggs), and Florentine (poached eggs). First off, all four dishes were so delicious - I really liked that each ingredient in the dishes tasted perfect and were cooked to perfection. Usually I'm not a fan of anything sweet, but the French Toast and Pancakes are to die for. I noticed a lot of good reviews for the pancakes, and I am a french toast lover so I just had to try both. \n\nThe poached egg dishes were very delicious as well. The potatoes that accompany the dishes are so good - I wanted to be good and opt for a salad, but with potatoes that good, you gotta be bad! Poached eggs were delicious along with each of its ingredients and english muffins were toasted very well. \n\nI LOVED each and every dish we tried today. The service was on point and friendly, and we were so lucky to have got to Zazie around 12pm today, and we didn't have to wait at all. I really liked the atmosphere - small and cozy, yet not too cramped. They also have a very cool spiral staircase at the front which I love, and wondered how the employees shoot up and down that thing carrying storage items.\n\nNot sure when I can return, but Zazie was definitely a wonderful brunch experience.

She gave me a generous taste and even after sitting on her plate for 10-15min, it tasted divine. The lemon curd and bosc pears were such excellent pairings and the \"gingerbreadiness\" of the pancake itself made me think about Christmas. A real treat. 4 stars\n\n3) The ambiance is the kicker that rounds up my review to 4 stars. It has a homeliness to it that takes you to the countryside with a clientele that represents the city of San Francisco. The noise level was at a minimum, making conversation easy. The walls are lined with Picasso-esque portraits and landscapes, and they have an outdoor patio area that especially appeals to dinner-diners. And the entrance has a winding staircase! (something my friend has always wanted in her house growing up). 5 stars.\n\nWith wonderful, friendly service in a simply pastoral atmosphere and delectable brunch food with a French influence, Zazie was great find.

There was a pork chop on the menu at one point with bread pudding (if I remember correctly) that was what I imagine crack must be like. The Mediterranean vegetable plate is a perfect starter, along with any soup that they make. Beet salad is good too. \n\nDesserts range from great to earth-shattering- my favorites are the fresh fruit crumble and the godlike Baked Chocolate Chaud (baked hot chocolate). I swear this stuff is not of this world- it morphs between a cakey-brownie-like texture which quickly gives way to thick melted chocolate, with an almost pudding-like consistency. Plus it's topped with melted marshmallows. I swear it will knock your socks clean off.\n\nBrunch is great too, but get there early, and get to know the man behind it all- Mario.

But I can't and I won't, because for me, a dining experience is all about the food and the food was fantastic.\n\nZazie's has that quaint French countryside feel about it that I love. There's a charming spiraled staircase that probably leads to a storage area on the side, clunky wooden tables and chairs that are wedged right next to each other and seating out front and at the patio out back. It's a little cramped, but it's charming. I dig it.\n\nThe wait was a little excessive, especially since my friend and I especially planned to get here before the rush - at 9:30-10, and we still ended up waiting around forty-five minutes. The Tully's right down the block is a godsend! Just grab a small drip coffee from there, take a walk around the block and it helps kill a lot of time, especially on a beautiful San Francisco morning (we've been getting more and more of those).\n\nThe food however, was fantastic. I ordered the egg scramble (Fontainbleu) with spinach, wild mushrooms, and fontina cheese folded in and it was ridiculously tasty and decadent. The potatoes are especially notable - unlike most brunch places that either burn their potatoes so that they're brown and hard or under cook them so that they're still grainy and lukewarm, Zazie's potatoes were perfect - crispy and hot on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside. With a pinch of rosemary, whole roasted garlic cloves (perfect for spreading on your potatoes, yum!) and probably a vat of butter (totally not complaining) I know I'd remember the potatoes.\n\nMy friend and I split an order of the gingerbread pancakes that came with a poached pear and lemon curd on top. While this in theory sounded like an orgasm in the form of a hot cake, it fell a little short. The flavors were all intact, I just would've liked my pancakes a little lighter and more moist.\n\nI wasn't blown away and was initially disgruntled when walking out of there because of the price (I was left almost twenty bucks poorer, from brunch?!), but a.

I've been told that costs for restaurants in the city have been skyrocketing of late due to (among other things) Paid Sick Leave, increased minimum wage, high gas prices causing new delivery charges, and a 400% rise in the cost of flour. Most of these factors come from measures passed by SF residents in elections. I can understand wanting to be a progressive city & set a high standard of living, but sometimes it seems a bit ridiculous that we're voting to raise our own taxes every single election period. C'mon people, a little restraint from time to time!\n\nAnyway, I guess this is Zazie's way of getting political. Rather than incorporate price changes into the items on the menu, they're showing you that your vote matters, & will directly translate to higher bills when you eat out.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-02-12"}, {"excerpts": ["but I'm just a little turned on by her boldness but the Gingerbread Pancakes that came out tuned mytaste buds up to 10 with out the syrup.

Mere blocks from the far more colorful Haight Ashbury neighborhood, Zazie is surrounded by wholesome little shops and town houses. People actually have babies/young children in this area (gasp). \n\nThe food is phenomenal whether you're an egg or carb-oriented breakfaster. I am equally obsessed with the fontainbleu egg scramble and the french toast tahiti (sinfully decadent - its stuffed with carmelized bananas and walnuts). I've also sampled and enjoyed the gingerbread pancakes (topped with roasted pears) and the Valence poached eggs. \n\nThe menu's best feature: most items are available in quantities of one, two and three - this goes for french toast, pancakes, and the multiple poached eggs variations. When my brunch companions and I have been particularly hungry or just feeling indulgent, we'll often get a single pancake or slice of french toast as a \"side\" in addition to our entrees. Conversely, it is also a good option for cost conscious brunchers. \n\n$$ and the long wait seem to be the two primary concerns about this spot, and I'd like to weigh in on both. With respect to cost, my personal philosophy is that brunch is invariably a good deal because you're getting two meals (breakfast and lunch) for the price of one. Even better, this form of justification/denial is equally applicable to food consumption - calories are spread out over two meals. (Yay loopholes!)\n\nAs for the wait, I've been here a bazillion times and have never waited for over 30 minutes. Maybe it's luck, but there's also a surprisingly well kept secret: the tables on the sidewalk are first come, first serve, so if it's a nice day put your name on the list and stake out the diners nearest to finishing. Also, dining in smaller parties helps (especially in twos), as tables for larger groups are limited. But alas, if you do have to wait, the Zazie host couldn't be nicer and remembers all regulars by sight and even name. \n\nI'd like to end this rambling review with an image that I believe is testament to Zazie's greatness. For a few weeks in the spring, Zazie closed for renovations. Being rather slow in the morning, I forgot this and showed up only to find the interior dark and a notice on the door. But it was worth the trip just to see the thousands of post-it notes from forlorn patrons that papered Zazie's windows, begging it to reopen soon.

I wish restaurants would return back to basics, simple and delicious, instead of overdoing a French toast or pancakes with overwhelming, inconsistent flavors.  I had a cold egg dish I could have made at home and split the gingerbread pancakes with my friend for a truly disappointing finale.  The cream that came with my coffee seemed like it had expired and was thick and poured out slowly.   Another detail: the waiter was one of the most unpleasant person I've ever seen in this kind of job.    The service staff to guest ratio is very low and it takes forever to get something, as well as get out of there. \n\nOnly nice point : the place is good looking and looks pretty much as good as a real brasserie and they are dog-friendly.   \n\nMy advice:  Don't waste your time.  With all the breakfast caf\u00e9s in SF, skip the line, and take back some of your morning.  In fact, the Bambino's or La Boulangerie next door is better and you  won't have to wait in line.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-08-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Gingerbread Pancakes - Fantastic.

I have been going to Zazie more often and i finally tried one of the benedict platters and realized why this place is awesome.  I hate poached eggs and i *crave* poached eggs from the zazie.  Plus, i have gotten to know the manager, Mario, especially well and realize that man works his tuckess off to make that place so awesome.  \n\nSo i have been here several times for breakfast, and the advantage with breakfast is that often you get it without the fuss, and fanfare of a busy dinner with other diners trying to snap up the waiter's attention before you can.  \n\nThe most redeeming part of Zazie is their Mango mimosas.  The second most redeeming quality is that i can order two eggs and a pancake of any kind and not have a plate served to me with a 5 egg omelet and a short stack.  They have the option on their menu to sample a little bit of everything (which i always encourage) in ones, twos and threes (olay!).  \n\nSo far i've tried the gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd (huh?) and it was interesting, but the pancakes end up being too dry and the only reason you even want that lemon curd is because you need something to moisten the pancakes because the syrup doesn't taste quite right with them.  \n\nI have also tried the lemon poppyseed pancakes that are only made occasionally and Damn!  Tha's all i can say.  Actually, i can say more.  Know how i mentioned the poached eggs?  i wanted more pancakes and that is just not like me....\n\nThen there is the Zazie omelet (or omelette du jour) which adds some avocado atop a cheesy eggedness and bacon.  This is a really fantastic omelette.  I recommend toast, and a big belly.\n\nThe Pain Paradise is just that.  Cinnamon french toast with bing cherries.  I don't think i've had something so good in a long time!  \n\nThe home fries are actually garlic roasted potatoes with full cloves mixed in and top off an already delicious and satifying breakfast.  While it's all a little pricey, it's worth the portions that are ample and the creative strokes added to commonality.  \n \nI have been lucky.  At opening hour, everyone has been amazingly considerate, except for the gruff \"it's not 8 o'clock yet.\" when i try to sit down inside at 7:55.  When they get their game faces on, usually they get nicer.  But wait...now that i think about it....some of them can be a little ditsy when they get flustered with a group of 3 or more.....\nHmm.

And on my next visit to SF, I went back to my eggs and pancakes and bowls full of espresso and was happy. The host in question was there, and was reeeeaally nice - so much so that I wondered if he recognized my friend and I - but it didn't feel cloying.\n\nIn short, the food is always great and the owner (at least) cares a lot about her business, so I'm going to give the review I would if it weren't for the incident below.\n\n****\n\nOh Zazie, you broke my heart!\n\nThis was my no.1 brunch spot in SF. I brought everyone I knew, and when I moved away, it was always a top priority when visiting. I had massive cravings for the gingerbread pancakes... the giant lattes in bowls... the eggs! the patio! the valence! The food is consistently great, and just different enough from the typical brunch fare to be interesting.\n\nSo why two stars?\n\nThe service sometimes sucks. One occasion caused me to avoid Zazie for a year; on the most recent occasion, I vowed never to return. \n\nOn the recent occasion, I came about noonish with a total of 9 people in my party. Someone spoke to the host, who said we'd need to split into two groups of four and five, respectively. No problem - I was expecting that. I know how busy it is, and I know how the place is laid out.\n\nA few minutes later, the host comes outside, rather hostilely billowing, \"WHO'S THE PARTY OF NINE??!?\" I identified myself. He is practically yelling at me, \"YOU CAN'T DO THAT! YOU HAVE TO SPLIT UP!\" \"Ok,\" I say. \"YOU MIGHT NOT SIT TOGETHER!\" \"Ok, that's fine,\" I say. \"MAYBE NOT AT THE SAME TIME!!\" \"Yes, ok, I understand, that's fine.\" I was really surprised at his aggression, considering I offered zero resistance, and in fact, totally expected this outcome.\n\nWe waited for a while, which one always does at Zazie. I never asked how long it would be, or anything. We just stood quietly on the sidewalk with everyone else. After a time, he took the first group of four inside to a table. We sat, ordered drinks, etc. Almost immediately, a table of five across the room leaves, and the bussers set the table again for a group of five. We think, \"Oh good, they won't have to wait long, and we'll all finish about the same time.\"\n\nBut! The host seats a different group of five at the table. \nWe are confused.\nSome time later (ten minutes?), the rest of our group is seated outside.\n\nWhen a member of our group (politely!) asked about it, the host rudely replied that he did that on purpose to TEACH US A LESSON!! He went on to say, how dare we come to his restaurant with nine people!  At which point we all almost got up and left, but I wanted my gingerbread pancakes one last time. When we asked to speak to the manager, we were informed by our (nice, sympathetic) waitress that HE was the manager! Great.\n\nThis would be different if even *once* we had offered resistance, or complained. As it went down, however, I see no difference between a group of 4 people signing the list immediately before a group of 5 who know each other, or who are total strangers. It's two tables of business.\n\nBut hey, I sure learned that lesson! Now I won't bring ANY people to Zazie, and many people I've told this story have vowed not to go there either.\n\nSigh.

Great food with reasonable price. \n\n2) Very cute patio seats, but I personally prefer indoors seats, cozy and sweet. \n\n3) Great, tentative, yet not pushy service. The waiter was very laid back, chill, but right there when you just about to need him.\n\n4) Prefer dinner much more than the brunch. Everything is excellent, but a bit too crowded and loud at brunch on weekends. But that's the point isn't it? Best place to go with hangover, and a great force to make sure you get up early on weekends and get there 10 minutes before 9. \n\n5) The owner loved me, so did the dishwashers.\n\nBrunch food:\n1) French Toast Tahiti: perfectly prepared french toasts, thick, fluffy, but heavenly soft. Caramelized banana adds the creamy texture, and the walnuts adds the crunchy kick. Nice and filling, yet not heavy.\n\n2) Gingerbread pancake: incredibly spongy and flavorful pancakes with a touch a lemon cream on top. Very yummy. Try it with the raspberry jam on the table. Much try at Zazie, and you'll see why it's always on the menu.\n\n3) Lemon Ricotta pancake: not the best I've tried. The best lemon ricotta cake that I've had is believe it or not, at the bar Feve in Oberlin Ohio. The cakes are too heavy, and a bit lack of flavor. The first one I got was not cooked through that tasted like the batter. Cookie dough is yummy, but not the pancake batter. Sent it back, got a better one, but still nicht so gute.\n\n4) Eggs Italie: scrambled eggs with tomatoes, cream cheese, and basil. Use your imagination. It's a great combination with good preparation. I personally make better scrambles with some pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. But Zazie cooks my brunch and takes care of the dishes, why not?\n\n3) Eggs Florentine: Best Egg benedict besides Chef and Butler. It is traditional and straight-forward. The Hollandaise is creamy but not heavy, doesn't leave the unpleasant stickiness in your mouth. Eggs perfectly poached. Bravo.\n\n6) The mimosa (grapefruit and something): not impressing at all. Couldn't finish it.\n\n7) Cappuccino: very very good, so good that I hate the fact that you can't have it refilled like a regular coffee.\n\nDinner:\n1) French Onion Soup: I would come here just for this bowl of dreams come true, especially at the end of a long tough day of 45 degrees. Very rich flavored soup, with bread crumbs that have still crunchy crust, OH MY GOD CRUNCHY CHEESY TOP.\n\n2) Salade Betterave: I love beets, and here you get 3 kinds of beets, green, gold, and red beets. I love fennels, and here you get fennels. Avocado and white gorgonzola vinegrette give the creamy texture. Yum. Everything I love thrown together, well balanced and light.\n\n3) Pate de Volaille: I hate liver of any animals. Just hate the taste. But, this one is AMAZING, like O.M.G. So smooth and creamy that just melt on your tongue, yes, THAT good. It doesn't have the nasty liver-y taste at all. One of our favorite dishes of the night. \n\n4) Mussels Marinieres: a little disappointed. The combination of white wine, shallots, parsley and cream is nice, very nice. But I don't like food that's \"slightly warm\", not cold, not warm, not hot, just slightly warm. It's not the best temperature to serve something creamy, I think.\n\n5) Lamb Tagine: braised lamb entree, looks much better on the menu than it tastes actually. Maybe just not my thing to throw everything together and serve it like a chinese congee. Not my favorite dish, but very well prepared I must say.\n\nDessert:\n1) Toasted Challah Bread Pudding: hands down, the best bread pudding in town, even slightly better than Tartine. Although it's not fair to compare 2 different ways of making bread pudding, I like it better at Zazie. I just love the variety of texture in the bowl, crunchy, creamy, bready, eggy, sweet, smooth, warm, but wow with the pumpkin spice icecream. Bravissimo!\n\n2) Cafe d'AUTOMNE: very interesting combination of Ciao bella Tahitian Vanilla bean and pumpkin icecream, pound cake crumbles, shot of espresso, whipped cream, and toasted almond. Interesting, but for some reason, it's just too much going on for me. But worth a try.\n\nTips: go with a group of people, like 4, get the sampler platter, choose 3  appetizers from the list of 6, and the dessert sampler platter choose 3 out of 7.

Plus, when I ordered an omelette once (and only once, in all fairness), it looked like my chihuahua could have eaten it and still been hungry.

It's a small space, so before entering you write your own name on a clipboard hanging on the window (taking Candice G's advice, I wrote S T E F F in the nicest, most legible penmanship of my life).

Number one: tipping isn't necessary because the employees are paid living wages and revenue shares (and amazing benefit packages). That's amazing. You can tell they're happy and dedicated. Number two: I wanted a bloody. I asked if it was made with worcestershire (since most worcestershire contains fish, and that's no bueno to this vegetarian). They regretfully let me know that they did make theirs with it. About fifteen minutes later a manager came up to our table to tell me that he had no idea that fish was in most worcestershire, thanked me for letting him know, then proceeded to go through all of their sauces/condiments to see what was veg-safe.

The second most redeeming quality is that i can order two eggs and a pancake of any kind and not have a plate served to me with a 5 egg omelet and a short stack.  They have the option on their menu to sample a little bit of everything (which i always encourage) in ones, twos and threes (olay!).  \n\nSo far i've tried the gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd (huh?) and it was interesting, but the pancakes end up being too dry and the only reason you even want that lemon curd is because you need something to moisten the pancakes because the syrup doesn't taste quite right with them.  \n\nI have also tried the lemon poppyseed pancakes that are only made occasionally and Damn!

The other restaurants reviewed from that show are Pagolac in the Tenderloin and Della Santini's Trattoria in Sonoma. ***\n_____________________________________\n\nZazie is the type of little French bistro that you could easily pass by if you're on a Parisian boulevard filled with similarly inviting eateries. You could even pass by it in the less bustling neighborhood of Cole Valley. Three times. I guess I'm just not that observant without a GPS. I decided to make the evening a group outing in order to try more of their menu. Other friends have come here for breakfast, but nobody I knew has tried dinner there, including me. What a loss for them. At first, I was a bit concerned the noise level would be unbearable given the tight quarters. In my head, I was imagining five bells ringing in the Chronicle listing. \n\nFortunately, the four of us were seated next to the front window, which afforded us a semi-private enclave and even a vitriolic opportunity to comment on the clothing of the diners coming in and out of the restaurant. We started ambitiously by sharing five -- count 'em, five -- starters. First up were the Mussels Marinieres, which they steam very nicely in white wine, garlic, shallots, and parsley, as it all bathes in a creamy broth (see photo). The salads were quite fresh tasting. The Salade d'Ete was the more original concoction with a mix of sliced strawberries, goat cheese, toasted almonds, and even flower petals on a bed of arugula (see photo). It was a dish that seemed to announce the arrival of spring. \n\nDespite its daring French New Wave filmmaking namesake, the Salade Louis Malle was more conventional: spinach, caramelized walnuts, and Gorgonzola in a balsamic vinaigrette (see photo). We all more equally shared the Assiette de Fromages, a nice selection of three soft French cheeses with figs and toasted walnuts. That left me being the most selfish by ordering the intentionally hard-to-share French Onion Soup Gratin\u00e9e with beef stock, a truly fine interpretation of a French classic that offers the irresistible lure of melted cheese (see photo). \n\nI was also able to try four of their entrees, all quite impressive in execution. With keen competition, the best had to be the Roasted Trout, which had a nice texture and an added burst of flavor from the cherry tomatoes in a basil vinaigrette and warm goat cheese (see photo). A close runner-up was the fresh Lemon Ricotta Ravioli, buttery smooth with wilted arugula, leeks, grilled prawns, garlic and aged parmesan cheese (see photo). A more traditional dish was the Lapin \u00e0 la Moutarde, which was the dark meat of the rabbit braised and covered in a Dijon mustard sauce with mushrooms (see photo). Underneath was a bed of fettuccine. It was more of a stew dish than I had envisioned, as the sauce got a bit sloshy, and the little rabbit bones tough to maneuver around. \n\nStill, it was quite tasty. The last entree was a signature dish, the Zazie Burger with cheddar, tomatoes Proven\u00e7al, and grilled Yukon gold potatoes (see photo). It was a good, juicy burger, if you are in the mood for one. We barely had any room for dessert, but for the sake of the show, I felt it was important to try at least one. We all took our spoons and dug into the Crumble Zazie, a generously sized fresh fruit cobbler that either came in a dish \u00e0 la mode or in a bowl drizzled with cr\u00e8me anglais (see photo). Lo and behold, we had both variations in front of us, and they were the perfectly French ender to our meal. \n\nFor what appears on the surface to be a neighborhood eatery, Zazie certainly offers a robust and eclectic menu, and there is even a prix fixe menu on select items in the menu (thus the appearance of the Zazie Burger on our table). For the most part, the waitstaff was quite nice and accommodating. The one hiccup was the selection of our wine. I went for a $32 bottle of the Chateau Horeau Cabernet Franc, definitely one of their more budget-conscious selections, and I swear I got a case of small-mouth from the waitress. \n\nThe place was bustling for most of the evening, but as it was a weeknight, the low hum of dining activity started to die down after 9 PM. I would definitely come back to Zazie in a heartbeat. It's right off the N-Judah line on Cole, so it's a really convenient location for me. And after all, this review is all about me. By the way, several months after my visit, I was able to meet owner Jennifer Piallat and her general manager Mario quite by accident through a friend at Barbacco. They are wonderful people who feel rightfully proud about their business. \n\nFOOD - 5 stars...first-class French bistro but comfortable, not snooty by a long shot \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...intimate with a nice patio \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...great, friendly waitstaff beyond reproach \nTOTAL - 5 stars...Jennifer, you should be very proud of your place", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-11-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Highly recommend the Pate Zazie (chicken livers, brandy), Salade Guillaume (arugula,k almonds, strawberries, chevre), Mussels Marinieres, Salmon en Papillote, and Grilled Hanger Steak w/mushroom brandy cream sauce. \n\n"], "author": "Donna E.", "review": "This is my 2nd time here for dinner; both times were fabulous!

This is the 714 review I've written.\n\nZazie's brunch items are good but I actually prefer their dinner menu and don't think brunch is worth the long wait.  Sometimes the bacon and home fries are overcooked.  For brunch I like the eggs valence - poached eggs with eggplant, tomato & chevre - it's healthier because it doesn't come with Hollandaise sauce but it is still packed with flavor.  I've been here quite a few times, for brunch and dinner, because we lived in the neighborhood and brought our out-of-town guests here.\n\nDinner is a better value and far less crowded.

I hate the restaurants that ask you how you want your steak and it is no where near what your odered. Haha, Zazie was perfect. Mussels were really tasty! Dipping the bread in the juice was yummy!!!!! The acidity level of the ravioli was on point. And, who can ever go wrong with some wine.\n\nThe Service:\nThe server had the perfect balance of service. He was very attentive and not annoying.

"], "author": "Yuchi C.", "review": "Overall impression:\n1) Best priced French restaurant in town. I hate the ones that try too hard and charge too much. Great food with reasonable price. \n\n2) Very cute patio seats, but I personally prefer indoors seats, cozy and sweet. \n\n3) Great, tentative, yet not pushy service. The waiter was very laid back, chill, but right there when you just about to need him.\n\n4) Prefer dinner much more than the brunch. Everything is excellent, but a bit too crowded and loud at brunch on weekends. But that's the point isn't it? Best place to go with hangover, and a great force to make sure you get up early on weekends and get there 10 minutes before 9. \n\n5) The owner loved me, so did the dishwashers.\n\nBrunch food:\n1) French Toast Tahiti: perfectly prepared french toasts, thick, fluffy, but heavenly soft. Caramelized banana adds the creamy texture, and the walnuts adds the crunchy kick. Nice and filling, yet not heavy.\n\n2) Gingerbread pancake: incredibly spongy and flavorful pancakes with a touch a lemon cream on top. Very yummy. Try it with the raspberry jam on the table. Much try at Zazie, and you'll see why it's always on the menu.\n\n3) Lemon Ricotta pancake: not the best I've tried. The best lemon ricotta cake that I've had is believe it or not, at the bar Feve in Oberlin Ohio. The cakes are too heavy, and a bit lack of flavor. The first one I got was not cooked through that tasted like the batter. Cookie dough is yummy, but not the pancake batter. Sent it back, got a better one, but still nicht so gute.\n\n4) Eggs Italie: scrambled eggs with tomatoes, cream cheese, and basil. Use your imagination. It's a great combination with good preparation. I personally make better scrambles with some pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. But Zazie cooks my brunch and takes care of the dishes, why not?\n\n3) Eggs Florentine: Best Egg benedict besides Chef and Butler. It is traditional and straight-forward. The Hollandaise is creamy but not heavy, doesn't leave the unpleasant stickiness in your mouth. Eggs perfectly poached. Bravo.\n\n6) The mimosa (grapefruit and something): not impressing at all. Couldn't finish it.\n\n7) Cappuccino: very very good, so good that I hate the fact that you can't have it refilled like a regular coffee.\n\nDinner:\n1) French Onion Soup: I would come here just for this bowl of dreams come true, especially at the end of a long tough day of 45 degrees. Very rich flavored soup, with bread crumbs that have still crunchy crust, OH MY GOD CRUNCHY CHEESY TOP.\n\n2) Salade Betterave: I love beets, and here you get 3 kinds of beets, green, gold, and red beets. I love fennels, and here you get fennels. Avocado and white gorgonzola vinegrette give the creamy texture. Yum. Everything I love thrown together, well balanced and light.\n\n3) Pate de Volaille: I hate liver of any animals. Just hate the taste. But, this one is AMAZING, like O.M.G. So smooth and creamy that just melt on your tongue, yes, THAT good. It doesn't have the nasty liver-y taste at all. One of our favorite dishes of the night. \n\n4) Mussels Marinieres: a little disappointed. The combination of white wine, shallots, parsley and cream is nice, very nice. But I don't like food that's \"slightly warm\", not cold, not warm, not hot, just slightly warm. It's not the best temperature to serve something creamy, I think.\n\n5) Lamb Tagine: braised lamb entree, looks much better on the menu than it tastes actually. Maybe just not my thing to throw everything together and serve it like a chinese congee. Not my favorite dish, but very well prepared I must say.\n\nDessert:\n1) Toasted Challah Bread Pudding: hands down, the best bread pudding in town, even slightly better than Tartine. Although it's not fair to compare 2 different ways of making bread pudding, I like it better at Zazie. I just love the variety of texture in the bowl, crunchy, creamy, bready, eggy, sweet, smooth, warm, but wow with the pumpkin spice icecream. Bravissimo!\n\n2) Cafe d'AUTOMNE: very interesting combination of Ciao bella Tahitian Vanilla bean and pumpkin icecream, pound cake crumbles, shot of espresso, whipped cream, and toasted almond. Interesting, but for some reason, it's just too much going on for me. But worth a try.\n\nTips: go with a group of people, like 4, get the sampler platter, choose 3  appetizers from the list of 6, and the dessert sampler platter choose 3 out of 7. Great deal, great food, and lots of fun with friends!\n\nThank you Zazie for your existence.

My timely friend for which the dinner reservation was under was shockingly late! (Super punctual friends with a black belt in time management really stress me out.) The gracious host was very sweet to excuse my sudden burst into the restaurant that put a pause in everyone's conversation. \n\nThe host was exceptionally professional and offered to seat me immediately. I politely declined, waited for my friends, and caught my breath outside. Since the French Bistro is without a wait area or bar, waiting in cramp spaces and saying, \"excuse me\" every other minute is not quite my thing. So I was glad my friend made reservations, highly recommended!\n\nOnce my friend found parking 20 minutes later, I reveled in relief and quickly calmed my nerves. Given such a delay, I thought we were at the host's liberty. Surprisingly, the host did not pull any stunt or attitude. Instead he treated us like any other punctual dinner patron and comfortably seated us up front behind the fish bowl window, the best spacious table, IMHO. Another point for great service.\n\nEverything on the menu resonated with my palette that evening. To simplify my decision, I chose the prix fixe deal, comes highly recommended at a great value for $23.50 which covers an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The prix fixe dinner is available for every single dinner with no restrictions on day, hour, or portion.\n\nThat helped narrow my decision down to a pate de vollaile, fish soup provencale, and decadent vanilla creme brulee. My friends ordered mussels marinieres, salmon grillade, and petit pot creme au chocolat. The pate was wonderfully flavorful. \n\nGood gawd! I wonder if Zazie specializes in French seafood dishes. My fish soup included a juicy salmon. Although the menu listed sea bass, the wait staff did not mention the substitution, which was a bit odd, but the delicious dish made me quickly brush that \"dust\" off my shoulder. I tried my friend's succulent grilled salmon. I was expecting a dry texture, but the chef was able to seal in the moisture. All the seafood dishes tasted very fresh.\n\nFinally the desserts topped off the great evening. The prix fixe is a fabulous deal to satiate even the hungriest patron!
