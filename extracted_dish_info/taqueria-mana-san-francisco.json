I actually wandered into this place by accident while taking a Sunday morning stroll through Chinatown, and was somewhat disappointed at first, because I made a cardinal error: when they asked me if I wanted a super taco, I told them no, I just wanted a regular taco. \n\nWhat I *should* have said, as it turns out, is that I wanted a mini taco, which is what I typically envision when I say \"regular taco\" - a couple little torn tortillas, some meat, some onions, some cilantro, some salsa. Here, \"regular tacos\" are the same as mini tacos, except that they have beans on top, which is a *terrible* idea. The bean-juice soaks into the tortillas and makes 'em all soggy, and beans are inferior to delicious meat anyway, so it's not a great scenario. \n\nBut, once I realized how to correct my mistake and also factored in how close this place is to the office, I resolved to return. And they did not disappoint. Every kind of meat here is actually pretty good. None of them particularly excels, but none disappoints, which is more than I can say about a lot of taquerias - their lengua, their al pastor, their carnitas, all traditional and tasty. \n\nI'd give Taqueria Mana three stars if it weren't for its location, but when I keep in mind the fact that I'll be going here about three times a week for the next few months, I can't help but go for four.

In the Burritos it makes for a fantastic burrito unless you like a sloppy joe of a Burrito. In that case I'll recommend El Farro where your burrito subscribes to Carl's Jr.'s former advertising campaign of \"If it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong in your face\".\n\nThe Carne Asada plate is phenomenal if you ask for it spicy. I ask for as hot as they can make it (and it still isn't quite hot enough) but it's ridiculously tasty and good. I eat here at least twice a week and never have had an issue with the food, cleanliness or anything else other than the Muni drivers using the bathroom without buying anything.\n\nAdditioanlly, what other Taqueria is going to offer you, flour, corn, spinach, and about 2 other types of tortillas for your burrito? I've yet to be offered that selection anywhere else.
