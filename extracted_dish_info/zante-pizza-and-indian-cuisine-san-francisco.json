It was somewhat interesting how we got to eating at this restaurant.  When we were talking with all the food cart guys and swapping good eats, one guy mentioned that a place called Zante's was incredible for Indian pizza.  Of course this piqued my interest as I love Indian food AND pizza so I made a mental note of it.  Then towards the end of our weekend of cheap eats, we were going to finish off the night at a place called the Limon Rotisserie but apparently it was too far out of the way for a friend so she recommended a place called the Front Porch in case we didn't have enough grease.  When I called in to make a reservation for 8pm, they weren't able to accommodate us right away so I hunkered down for the wait.  That's when a completely different friend mentioned that there was a supposedly great Indian pizza restaurant nearby called Zante's!  Apparently this place always had a wait but we figured we might as well wait for it and if our rezos at Front Porch came along first, we could just walk over.  Well, lucky us the manager was willing to seat us right away!  \n\nWe ordered an extra large Indian pizza, some curry that was supposed to be just like chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, samosas, naan, chicken and vegetable Pakora.  The Pakoras were a hit!  The samosas and chicken tandoori were only okay unfortunately because I LOVE samosas but by far the most disappointing item was the chicken tikka-like curry.  It was pretty darn bad is all I can say.  That teaches us to order curry when the restaurant is famous for its pizza.  Now for the pizza.  The first words to fly out of my mouth were that is was interestingly GREAT!  I don't even know what was all in the pizza because there were so many toppings but it was great and all the ingredients all worked well together.  I remembered the shopped shrimp being a delightful surprise.  Well worth all the other obstacles (bad curry) to get there.  One thing to note was that I did not feel too great when I got home.  One of the girls I spoke with later told me that when she went to the bathroom during dinner she saw mouse droppings all over the staircase!

There's nothing like this in NYC where I came from.

I look at him confused. He repeats it again and then asks,\n\n\"Are you indian?\" \n\"Yes I am..\" \n\"Where from in India?\" (Note the ordering of the words hehe)\n\"I'm from the South..\"\n\nZante uncle sighs and walks away without a word. In a stern tone he asks \"what pizza you vant?\" I say I would like I try a chicken tikka masala slice (I became white for a second y'all!) to see if I wanted to buy the whole pizza. So he prepared a slice for me. He said it was complimentary, which was very nice of him because Indian people never do that. I took the slice and sat down to eat. The place was empty. Apparently folks never sit down to eat. They might as well cut out the sit down part of their restaurant and just do pizza take out and delivery. Just sayin. Anyways I continue. I call a waiter uncle to ask him what the difference between the paneer and chicken masala pizza is... \n\n\"Excuse me-\"\n\"Hindi @*&#^$...\"\n\"huh?\"\n\"You please say it in Hindi..\"\n\"I don't speak Hindi...\"\n\nHe gave me that LOOK like \"you younger generation peoples are fucked up, don't know your language, don't have indian identity, just all whitewashed!!!\"\n\nSo I gave him this LOOK back like \"listen uncle, Hindi is NOT my native language, never was, never will be. I am a Tamil girl and I speak MY language, Tamil. Fluently. For the record, not all brown people are indian and not all Indians speak Hindi. There's a reason why my people rebelled and rioted against this language, which is why most of us don't speak it. If you uncles come to my state with that Hindi, racist terms like \"Madrasi,\" and bogus stereotypes from Bollywood propaganda movies like Chennai Express, y'all would get your asses kicked. Figuratively of course. We are a peaceful species :) \n\nIf you have seen indian soap operas, you know that one LOOK and a flash of thunder and lightning can communicate quite a lot. Hehe\n\nSO. The chicken one was not horrible except for the chicken part (had no flavor), so I asked to order the paneer one instead. Waiter uncle suggested a half and half of saag paneer based veggie and the paneer tikka masala pizza. So the pizza overall was ok but NOTHING like CanAm Indian pizza from Seattle. CanAm is in a different league. They set the bar way too high for Mr. Zante to jump over. I am giving this place 4 stars because I strongly support the concept of Indian Pizza. And I took off one star because it's always that annoying kid who gets an A++ in everything that ruins the bell curve for everyone else.

It was somewhat interesting how we got to eating at this restaurant.  When we were talking with all the food cart guys and swapping good eats, one guy mentioned that a place called Zante's was incredible for Indian pizza.  Of course this piqued my interest as I love Indian food AND pizza so I made a mental note of it.  Then towards the end of our weekend of cheap eats, we were going to finish off the night at a place called the Limon Rotisserie but apparently it was too far out of the way for a friend so she recommended a place called the Front Porch in case we didn't have enough grease.  When I called in to make a reservation for 8pm, they weren't able to accommodate us right away so I hunkered down for the wait.  That's when a completely different friend mentioned that there was a supposedly great Indian pizza restaurant nearby called Zante's!  Apparently this place always had a wait but we figured we might as well wait for it and if our rezos at Front Porch came along first, we could just walk over.  Well, lucky us the manager was willing to seat us right away!  \n\nWe ordered an extra large Indian pizza, some curry that was supposed to be just like chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, samosas, naan, chicken and vegetable Pakora.

For instance, a really divine meal involves ordering a cheese pizza and then an order of Chicken Korma and then dipping said pizza slices into the sauce!  It's a departure from the Naan bread you would normally use to sop up the yummy sauces (though this place has GREAT naan..I recommend Plain or Garlic Naan)\n\nI have had no problems with ordering over the phone...in fact, one of the owners, Tony, who is totally hot by the way, knows my VOICE now! and my favorites!    Hot! Hotter! Hottest!! (~_~)   Yes, sometimes when I call and Tony's not there, you might get someone who speaks with an accent, but we can understand each other enough to give/receive a dinner order!   I agree with other posters who mentioned, this place surely is NOT the Four Seasons in terms of decor..it's a Pizza-Indian place in the Mission, are you that surprised this place isn't like a scene from a dinner party in \"Brideshead Revisited?\" BUT..they have cheap pitchers of good  beer, (TAJ Mahal? KingFisher anyone?)  plenty of room if you have a big group or someone has a kid in a stroller or someone's in a wheel chair (I run with a wild crowd (~_~) I dunno, all around this place is a winner,  I wish the prices were a tad cheaper AND I do wish they had parking!  It's a very busy area, the nearby corners are almost ALL bus stops, you may circle 5-10 times before finding a space 3 blocks away!  You could \"bus\" it there if you're into that sort of thing...they do have a parking lot in the back  (Enter on Cortland Ave) but it's kinda dark and narrow and scary...always filled with cars (of the workers) or delivery guys...so it's almost a \"why bother\" shrug type thing...oh well.  Still love this place for dine in or delivery, yum pizza and Indian food, cute Tony on the phones or handing you your take out...Git along lil doggies...over to Zante's!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I've never had any trouble, but today was especially easy -- received my order 35 minutes after placing my order, delivery guy was especially friendly and feisty, and my chicken korma and pizza were especially tasty.

My husband and I decided to make this a lazy Monday order-in night, and the plan was to have the delivery around 8pm, when he was planning on getting back home.  Since I got home first, I went onto GrubHub to browse for a new place to try.  I saw Zante and remembered I had wanted to try it before.  I checked quickly on Yelp and saw it had 4 stars and the first few reviews sounded reassuring, so since it was already 7:30pm, I quickly ordered several things, including an Indian pizza, of course.\n\nIt wasn't until AFTER I placed the order that I kept browsing the rest of the Yelp reviews out of curiosity.  And to my dismay, I saw the numerous reviews describing poor service, horrible delivery times of 2 hours, cold pizza, and mixed up or lost orders.  I get a sinking feeling in my stomach.  Our late dinner was going to become a very very late dinner....\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n7:33pm - GrubHub order entered.  Estimated delivery time 8:23pm.\n\n7:35pm - GrubHub confirmation email received.  Updated estimated delivery time is 8:25pm.\n\n7:51pm - I call Zante to make sure the have at least received my online order.  The guy who answers the phone asks for my address, then quickly says \"Yeah, we got your order.  It's leaving now.\"  short pause. \"It's almost ready, it will leave in a few minutes.\"  Since it has only been 18 minutes since I put in my order, and since I've seen all the other Yelp reviews, I think to myself he must automatically say that for every phone call.  I ask him to read my my order.  He reads the items.  At least they really got the order.\n\n7:56pm - Husband arrives home.  I tell him I ordered food but warn him we might have to wait a while, really worried that I ordered too quickly before doing thorough Yelp research....\n\n8:04pm - Cell phone rings.  It's the delivery man.  He says he's downstairs.  I'm suspicious, thinking this is too fast to be real.  Is he calling before he's really here?\n\n8:07pm - Delivery man arrives at our door with the food.  I'm in disbelief.  He's 18 minutes ahead of schedule, and barely half an hour after the order placed.\n\nAnd the food?  It's all hot.  Normal take-out containers.  No soggy gooey cardboard boxes.  The pizza is quite good, and the rest (saag paneer, chicken mushroom, salad, raita, samosas) is pretty good too.  Lots of food for the price - enough for 3 full meals for the two of us.

Stand a lone, you're getting a spinach, cauliflower, chicken tandoori, some shrimp, mozarella over a spinacy sauce and curry sauce layer. The pizza dough seems to be doughy, yet light (maybe Roti dough is thrown in), and have a yellow color, probably from tumeric. It is amazing. If you like a garlic pizza (similar to garlic clam pizzas), this is the pizza to get. While there is a lot of masking of flavor (the garlic is over powering at times, the tandoori is chopped so that there aren't many large chicken chunks or huge tandoori flavor), it just tastes freaking good (then again I can eat a ton of garlic).\n\nThe key to the pizza - ASK for spicy and sweet sauce. The spicy sauce is a cilantro/pepper cream based sauce... that is seriously crack. While hot stand alone, the heat actually goes away when mixed with the pizza and adds another layer of flavor, though it also heavily emphasizes the garlic. The sweet sauce appears to be a tamarind based vinegar/sugar sauce, which also adds a layer of complexity when combined with the pizza.\n\nI can't emphasize how ridiculously addicting this pizza was.

Don't order online. I'm not sure why they have this feature on their website. They don't check it. If you forget that you ordered it online, then so will they and you will be hungry.\n\n2. All versions of their Indian Pizza taste exactly the same. Extra sauce? Tikka Masala? All the same. Don't think too hard.\n\n3. Ask for extra red & green side sauces. They won't remember to bring them, but that's cool. If you don't order them you'll wish you had, and at least now you know you tried.\n\n4. Be high when you order. It's fun. Not just from the usual \"it's fun to be high\" perspective, but because you have people offering you Indian Pizza on the other end of the phone, a proposition who's full impact can only truly be appreciated when you're three millimeters of impulse control away from deep-frying batter-dipped chocolate chip cookies. \n\n5. Get at least a double order of pakora. Small servings, and the part of you that is demanding deep-fried food will be satisfied. \n\n6. Put on a movie. No matter how long the movie is, the food will arrive exactly at the midway point, ten minutes after you start wondering just where the fuck your food is.\n\n7. Double check your order when it shows up. Like I said, they won't have the green & red sauces you ordered, but let it go, let it go. Just make sure your mango lassi made it from the driver's car to your house. It didn't, and you need to call them to have them call the driver and tell him to turn around and bring it to you. This conversation will take a little while, because they won't initially believe you.\n\n8. This is a superimportant one: don't eat the whole pizza. Stick what's left in the fridge. In the morning, scramble & soft-cook a few eggs with whatever's left of the green & red sauces that you hopefully didn't actually drink, and then bake the remaining pizza with the eggs on top.\n\nKeep these things in mind, and you will have a fantastic experience.

All versions of their Indian Pizza taste exactly the same. Extra sauce? Tikka Masala? All the same. Don't think too hard.\n\n3. Ask for extra red & green side sauces. They won't remember to bring them, but that's cool. If you don't order them you'll wish you had, and at least now you know you tried.\n\n4. Be high when you order. It's fun. Not just from the usual \"it's fun to be high\" perspective, but because you have people offering you Indian Pizza on the other end of the phone, a proposition who's full impact can only truly be appreciated when you're three millimeters of impulse control away from deep-frying batter-dipped chocolate chip cookies. \n\n5.

Double check your order when it shows up. Like I said, they won't have the green & red sauces you ordered, but let it go, let it go. Just make sure your mango lassi made it from the driver's car to your house. It didn't, and you need to call them to have them call the driver and tell him to turn around and bring it to you. This conversation will take a little while, because they won't initially believe you.\n\n8. This is a superimportant one: don't eat the whole pizza. Stick what's left in the fridge. In the morning, scramble & soft-cook a few eggs with whatever's left of the green & red sauces that you hopefully didn't actually drink, and then bake the remaining pizza with the eggs on top.\n\nKeep these things in mind, and you will have a fantastic experience.

I haven't had any of their other food yet, so I have nothing to say about anything but their pizza.\n\nFirst I'll say that I like Indian food, and I also like pizza.  This doesn't necessarily mean that I'd like them together, though.  (For example - I like dry diced chicken from San Tung on Irving, and I like pearl milk tea, but although I've never had it, I suspect that I would not like milk tea with diced chicken bits in it, if you know what I mean).\n\nSo when the idea of getting an Indian pizza was put out there, I wasn't sure whether to be excited or nervous.  \n\nAfter watching a PBS special, though,  where two guys out ice climbing on a glacier somewhere in South America got separated from one another, one of them falling 150 feet down onto the ice, crashing through it and falling 50 more feet into an icy crevasse, getting stuck there for a day or so and finally crawling his way out of there and pulling himself across 5 miles of treacherous ice, over boulders and back to the camp with a compound fracture in his leg, to rejoin his buddies who had already been mourning his certain death for the previous 4 days, I figured it would be rather wimpy to avoid trying a pizza just because it seemed like the toppings might be outside my normal comfort zone.  \n\nAnd I'm really happy to say that like those ice climbing guys, but very likely with a good amount less bravery, I went for it, living on the edge.  The Best Indian Pizza, topped with spinach, eggplant, cauliflower, ginger, garlic, green onions, cilantro and tandoori chicken was really, really tasty.  I loved the spiciness of the toppings and the way the flavors complimented each other.  I'll definitely have the pizza again, and even though it seems that other yelpers have had less than stellar experiences with the other food here, I'll probably give it a go next time just because I liked this pizza so much.  \n\nAlso, I took the pizza out so have no opinion about the service or decor.
