We opted for a mix, but I definitely preferred the clams - they seemed sweeter and more tender in my opinion. However, the white wine broth that accompanied the seafood was divine - I definitely used as dip for the bread at our table.\n\nFor our entrees, my parents and I shared 3 dishes, all were excellent in their own way...but our favorite was definitely the Tortellini Carbonara. The sauce wasn't too creamy and overwhelming, just enough to thoroughly hug each tortellini. There was also a good amount of mushrooms and pancetta accompanying the dish to add notes of flavor and change up the texture as well. \n\nOur second favorite was the lasagne. It was so smooth and served up nice and hot such that the cheese was still all ooey-gooey and stringy - yum! Pasta was not too thick and there was just enough meat and cheese to go around. Quote of the night? \"It's no Stouffer's, that's for sure!\" \n\nAnd last but not least, we had the Gnocchi Gorgonzola. They were like little potato pillows filled with spinach and ricotta. Definitely not doughy and definitely one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had recently in North Beach.\n\nAll in all, meal was delicious.

Reading reviews of Megan D and Natalie I, this seemed like the logical place. Interestingly painted in green (something to do with the national flag?), it certainly isn't difficult to find. When you enter, the bar is on the right and the main dining room (about eight to ten tables) is to the left. Being only a party of two, the hostess was kind and understanding in seating us at a center table for four (we're pretty big guys!). After reviewing the menu and getting our bread basket with olive oil, my eyes wandered about the dining room. Behind me, I noticed a makeshift stage above with ceramic statues of Sammy, Frank, and Dean. Lined across the far left wall were various clippings, posters, and photographs of these three too... see a recurring theme? There was one photo of Tony Manero (aka John Travolta in his white suit). Directly to the rear of the dining room, the kitchen was open with several people busily preparing the meals. It turned out that my visiting friend ate here during his last trip, so the menu was his choice. Here is what we shared: \nAppetizer: \na) Fried Calamari - Thickly coated calamari meat pieces, fried and served with two Marinara and tartar sauce. The calamari meat was of good quality, but my preference is a mixture with the curly (tentacles) parts too. The batter was bland, hence the need for the two sauces. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=pM2_u3npUaXL7u8_i2wKKw) \nEntrees: \nb) Tortellini Carbonara - Cheese filled tortellini dumplings filled with ricotta cheese in a heavy cream sauce with small pancetta cubes and white mushroom slices. Filling and generous portions. As always, love my plentiful mushrooms.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=6lrMV9twcEDcX2EgjY-tXA) \nc) Linguine with Clams, White Sauce - Made with fresh in-shell clams, this is another hearty pasta sauce, using a cream sauce with lemon garnish. Definitely, not for someone looking for a light dinner.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=YW9Zh2TmWt-Cz-yI0qlUbA) \nSide order \nd) Meatballs - Two freshly made meatballs in a savory Marinara sauce. Meatball flavor had a heavy celery (?) or other veggie flavor, but was a good pace change from the above choices (ordered after seeing other tables getting this - see-food diet!). \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=qtRMgrLpdbW13IbgQc8NTg) \n\nBoth pasta dishes came with a small slice of garlic bread, perfect for sopping up the remaining sauce(s). In my case, I cleaned my meatball sauce. My friend commented that he LOVES their food because they actually use the heavy cream sauces that we remember from the '60's and '70's when \"trans fat\" wasn't even listed in the dictionary; after dinner, I could feel the cream oozing through my veins.

We started with the Bruscetta, which is six large and nicely toasted pieces of bread covered with heaping portions of diced tomatoes mixed with garlic, basil and olive oil. The garlic flavor was quite strong but everyone enjoyed the start to the meal. Per usual, I had the Chicken Caesar Salad for my entree. It's probably enough for 2 to 3 hungry folks. Heaps of crisp romaine lettuce are topped with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and large, moist chunks of grilled chicken breast. The dressing is delicious and I enjoy that there are anchovies in the dressing as it adds that distinct rich and nutty flavor without having the filets directly in the dish. Others had the special of the day, which was Grilled Prawns with Linguini in a pesto sauce, and Tortellini Con Pesto, or beef-filled tortellini in a creamy basil and garlic sauce. The rich, verdant green in the sauces was appealing and the flavors were all delicious. There wasn't much beef in the tortellini but the creamy cheese inside was flavorful and even a bit piquant. All in all a casual and enjoyable meal in a true North Beach institution.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-04-23"}], "linguine sodini": [{"excerpts": ["I love love love the Linguine Sodini and garlic cheese bread.

Reading reviews of Megan D and Natalie I, this seemed like the logical place. Interestingly painted in green (something to do with the national flag?), it certainly isn't difficult to find. When you enter, the bar is on the right and the main dining room (about eight to ten tables) is to the left. Being only a party of two, the hostess was kind and understanding in seating us at a center table for four (we're pretty big guys!). After reviewing the menu and getting our bread basket with olive oil, my eyes wandered about the dining room. Behind me, I noticed a makeshift stage above with ceramic statues of Sammy, Frank, and Dean. Lined across the far left wall were various clippings, posters, and photographs of these three too... see a recurring theme? There was one photo of Tony Manero (aka John Travolta in his white suit). Directly to the rear of the dining room, the kitchen was open with several people busily preparing the meals. It turned out that my visiting friend ate here during his last trip, so the menu was his choice. Here is what we shared: \nAppetizer: \na) Fried Calamari - Thickly coated calamari meat pieces, fried and served with two Marinara and tartar sauce. The calamari meat was of good quality, but my preference is a mixture with the curly (tentacles) parts too. The batter was bland, hence the need for the two sauces. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=pM2_u3npUaXL7u8_i2wKKw) \nEntrees: \nb) Tortellini Carbonara - Cheese filled tortellini dumplings filled with ricotta cheese in a heavy cream sauce with small pancetta cubes and white mushroom slices. Filling and generous portions. As always, love my plentiful mushrooms.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=6lrMV9twcEDcX2EgjY-tXA) \nc) Linguine with Clams, White Sauce - Made with fresh in-shell clams, this is another hearty pasta sauce, using a cream sauce with lemon garnish. Definitely, not for someone looking for a light dinner.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=YW9Zh2TmWt-Cz-yI0qlUbA) \nSide order \nd) Meatballs - Two freshly made meatballs in a savory Marinara sauce. Meatball flavor had a heavy celery (?) or other veggie flavor, but was a good pace change from the above choices (ordered after seeing other tables getting this - see-food diet!). \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=qtRMgrLpdbW13IbgQc8NTg) \n\nBoth pasta dishes came with a small slice of garlic bread, perfect for sopping up the remaining sauce(s). In my case, I cleaned my meatball sauce. My friend commented that he LOVES their food because they actually use the heavy cream sauces that we remember from the '60's and '70's when \"trans fat\" wasn't even listed in the dictionary; after dinner, I could feel the cream oozing through my veins. Must admit that my taste has changed and my preference to lighter fare these days.  On my next trip here, I would like to try their Minestrone soup and their special that night (Osso Bucco with Linguine). The food rates a solid 3.5 stars, adding 0.5 star for the atmosphere.

The menu features abotu 10 antipasti including gooey and delicious cheese bread and steamers (you can choose clams or mussels) cooked in a white wine broth and served with garlic bread, as well as lots of varieties of pastas with various sauces, meat entrees including a gorgeous Pepper Steak and Chicken Alla Sodini (grilled chicken topped with ham, mozzarella and cream sauce served with linguine alla casa), and lots of pizza options.

Whenever I'm in North Beach looking for good, old-fashioned Italian food, I stop by Sodini's first.  It's a very popular place and the wait time is usually 30-45 minutes.  This is typical for the area and should be factored in if you or your party are starving.  I will say it is worth the wait.\n\nI told my friend about this place and she was interested in trying it.  She doesn't know the city that well so it was also an opportunity to explore the neighborhood.  As a native San Franciscan (born & raised) who lives outside the city for some time now, it's a treat go back.  The area is so rich in history and culture and I miss it so much.\n\nWe arrived there a little after 6:00 pm and was told by the hostess that there was a 30-45 minute.  As mentioned by other reviewers, she took a mobile phone number and told us she call when our table was ready.  I suggested we walk around my old stomping ground and maybe try to find a bar that wasn't too crowded.  It also gave me the chance to play tour guide.  As luck would have it, the hostess called back in 10 minutes saying she could seat us. \n\nWhat I love about Sodini's is the neighborhood feel and lack of pretension.  It's not trying to be anything but great, little restaurant.  What I love most is the food.  It succeeds on both counts.  You can tell if the food is going to be good or not by how the place smells.  Immediately, you smell the garlic with a hint of tomato sauce and you know it's going to good.  The place was packed, which was also a good sign.\n\nWe were sat right away and after a few minutes our server introduced herself and took our drink orders (my friend had a lemon drop & I had a pint of Anchor Steam).  While enjoying our drinks and reviewing the menu, I scanned the meals being enjoyed by the other patrons and everything looked so good.  I chose a very decadent Tortellini Carbonara.  This is one of my favorite Italian dishes--although I try to order it infrequently--and I hadn't had theirs in years.  Without a doubt, this one of the best I've every tried.  Carbonara sauce can be tricky because it's just the right combination of egg yolks, cheese, pancetta and black pepper.  Some places have screwed it up by adding non-traditional ingredients to it like bacon and/or sausage (c'mon, man).  Sodini's gets it right using only traditional ingredients.  The tortellini was cooked to perfection; nothing ruins a carbonara like overcooked pasta.  I literally could have eaten two entire plates.\n\nMy friend had the Tortellini all Panna and it too was fantastic.  Both of our dishes came with garlic bread and I only wish there was more.  Thankfully, there was a basket of bread.  Yes, it was a carb-explosion.  My god, everything was so good.  We're definitely going back.\n\nFinally, our server (I forget her name) was awesome.  She was knowledgeable and attentive.  We couldn't have asked for more.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-10-04"}, {"excerpts": ["My tortellini carbonara had a nice cream sauce with pancetta atop al dente pasta rings.

Quote of the night? \"It's no Stouffer's, that's for sure!\" \n\nAnd last but not least, we had the Gnocchi Gorgonzola. They were like little potato pillows filled with spinach and ricotta. Definitely not doughy and definitely one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had recently in North Beach.\n\nAll in all, meal was delicious. Service was friendly and fun...and the feel was cozy, albeit a little dark inside. I would definitely say that this is one of the better Italian restaurants in North Beach/Little Italy and it doesn't need a promoter outside like some on Columbus Ave!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Best tortellini carbonara ever from a person who cooks regularly.

Reading reviews of Megan D and Natalie I, this seemed like the logical place. Interestingly painted in green (something to do with the national flag?), it certainly isn't difficult to find. When you enter, the bar is on the right and the main dining room (about eight to ten tables) is to the left. Being only a party of two, the hostess was kind and understanding in seating us at a center table for four (we're pretty big guys!). After reviewing the menu and getting our bread basket with olive oil, my eyes wandered about the dining room. Behind me, I noticed a makeshift stage above with ceramic statues of Sammy, Frank, and Dean. Lined across the far left wall were various clippings, posters, and photographs of these three too... see a recurring theme? There was one photo of Tony Manero (aka John Travolta in his white suit). Directly to the rear of the dining room, the kitchen was open with several people busily preparing the meals. It turned out that my visiting friend ate here during his last trip, so the menu was his choice. Here is what we shared: \nAppetizer: \na) Fried Calamari - Thickly coated calamari meat pieces, fried and served with two Marinara and tartar sauce. The calamari meat was of good quality, but my preference is a mixture with the curly (tentacles) parts too. The batter was bland, hence the need for the two sauces. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=pM2_u3npUaXL7u8_i2wKKw) \nEntrees: \nb) Tortellini Carbonara - Cheese filled tortellini dumplings filled with ricotta cheese in a heavy cream sauce with small pancetta cubes and white mushroom slices. Filling and generous portions. As always, love my plentiful mushrooms.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=6lrMV9twcEDcX2EgjY-tXA) \nc) Linguine with Clams, White Sauce - Made with fresh in-shell clams, this is another hearty pasta sauce, using a cream sauce with lemon garnish. Definitely, not for someone looking for a light dinner.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=YW9Zh2TmWt-Cz-yI0qlUbA) \nSide order \nd) Meatballs - Two freshly made meatballs in a savory Marinara sauce. Meatball flavor had a heavy celery (?) or other veggie flavor, but was a good pace change from the above choices (ordered after seeing other tables getting this - see-food diet!). \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=qtRMgrLpdbW13IbgQc8NTg) \n\nBoth pasta dishes came with a small slice of garlic bread, perfect for sopping up the remaining sauce(s). In my case, I cleaned my meatball sauce. My friend commented that he LOVES their food because they actually use the heavy cream sauces that we remember from the '60's and '70's when \"trans fat\" wasn't even listed in the dictionary; after dinner, I could feel the cream oozing through my veins. Must admit that my taste has changed and my preference to lighter fare these days.  On my next trip here, I would like to try their Minestrone soup and their special that night (Osso Bucco with Linguine). The food rates a solid 3.5 stars, adding 0.5 star for the atmosphere.

Why is it then that we have a trattoria in North Beach that has survived and flourished year in and year out, maintaining a reputation reinforced by in the Bay Guardian's Best of the Bay Awards? According to the Guardian Sodini's is the \"Best Old Style Italian Restaurant\" in San Francisco.\n\n I asked Mark Sodini about this one night at his packed restaurant, with people waiting in line out of the door. \"It's the employees,\" he answered, \"Most have been with us for over a decade. We have one girl who is new. She has only been here six years. Our chef, Rufigio, has been cooking here for 12 years.\" Those of us who have enjoyed going to the restaurant for years know beautiful Ana. She runs the full bar and welcomes everyone who steps in the door as if the place was hers. Our server, Rachelle, started working at Sodini's nine years ago as a single woman. Now she is married with three babies. This is a family restaurant in more ways than one. Mark told me that his brother bought the place 16 years ago, and Mark joined him one year later. Not long after, Mark took the establishment over and has run it day in and day out, 360 days a year.\n\n   In addition to his staff, Mark attributes his success (he has never advertised) to Old World Italian food, with many of the recipes being his grandmother's. He supplements the neighborhood feel of his place with products from North Beach:  pasta strips for lasagna from Molinari's and crusty bread from the Italian French Bakery. The restaurant draws eighty percent of its customers from the neighborhood. \n\n The walls are covered in memorabilia and art. There's a painting of the old Green Valley Restaurant that Sodini's replaced, a mural that positions the viewer to look from the restaurant down Green Street, and another one, executed by a former waitress, that shows Mark's brother kissing his wife, amid grape vines. \n\n  As for the food, if there was a prize in North Beach for the best house salad, Sodini's would win hands down. The fresh romaine lettuce is supported by, black olives, onion, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans, croutons and mushrooms. However, it is the house made dressing, made of blue cheese, olive oil, garlic and lemon that makes the salad. The fried calamari appetizer is not your generic North Beach fried calamari. Sodini's only serves the rings, which are lightly battered and lightly fried, leaving the calamari extremely tender. This delicacy is accompanied by spicy aioli sauce. \n \n The restaurant's signature pasta dish is Tortellini Carbonara. This beef filled tortellini ring has a light cream Alfredo Sauce made with mushrooms and pancetta. The tortellinis melt in your mouth and the sauce is light. Biting into a piece of pancetta brings this otherwise mild dish to life. Lamb lovers will enjoy the rack of lamb, infused with butter, grilled to perfection and served with a generous portion of linguine pesto. My favorite vegetable at Sodini's is the saut\u00e9ed spinach, with mushrooms. It is fresh, tender and not greasy or overcooked. Try it with a little hand-grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.\n\n So one night when you are wondering where to eat, saunter over to Sodini's. You will be treated wonderfully, leave with a belly full of good food and feel like you have just been to an Italian family's home for dinner. Just remember their motto: No decaf. No reservations.

Why is it then that we have a trattoria in North Beach that has survived and flourished year in and year out, maintaining a reputation reinforced by in the Bay Guardian's Best of the Bay Awards? According to the Guardian Sodini's is the \"Best Old Style Italian Restaurant\" in San Francisco.\n\n I asked Mark Sodini about this one night at his packed restaurant, with people waiting in line out of the door. \"It's the employees,\" he answered, \"Most have been with us for over a decade. We have one girl who is new. She has only been here six years. Our chef, Rufigio, has been cooking here for 12 years.\" Those of us who have enjoyed going to the restaurant for years know beautiful Ana. She runs the full bar and welcomes everyone who steps in the door as if the place was hers. Our server, Rachelle, started working at Sodini's nine years ago as a single woman. Now she is married with three babies. This is a family restaurant in more ways than one. Mark told me that his brother bought the place 16 years ago, and Mark joined him one year later. Not long after, Mark took the establishment over and has run it day in and day out, 360 days a year.\n\n   In addition to his staff, Mark attributes his success (he has never advertised) to Old World Italian food, with many of the recipes being his grandmother's. He supplements the neighborhood feel of his place with products from North Beach:  pasta strips for lasagna from Molinari's and crusty bread from the Italian French Bakery. The restaurant draws eighty percent of its customers from the neighborhood. \n\n The walls are covered in memorabilia and art. There's a painting of the old Green Valley Restaurant that Sodini's replaced, a mural that positions the viewer to look from the restaurant down Green Street, and another one, executed by a former waitress, that shows Mark's brother kissing his wife, amid grape vines. \n\n  As for the food, if there was a prize in North Beach for the best house salad, Sodini's would win hands down. The fresh romaine lettuce is supported by, black olives, onion, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans, croutons and mushrooms. However, it is the house made dressing, made of blue cheese, olive oil, garlic and lemon that makes the salad. The fried calamari appetizer is not your generic North Beach fried calamari. Sodini's only serves the rings, which are lightly battered and lightly fried, leaving the calamari extremely tender. This delicacy is accompanied by spicy aioli sauce. \n \n The restaurant's signature pasta dish is Tortellini Carbonara. This beef filled tortellini ring has a light cream Alfredo Sauce made with mushrooms and pancetta. The tortellinis melt in your mouth and the sauce is light. Biting into a piece of pancetta brings this otherwise mild dish to life. Lamb lovers will enjoy the rack of lamb, infused with butter, grilled to perfection and served with a generous portion of linguine pesto. My favorite vegetable at Sodini's is the saut\u00e9ed spinach, with mushrooms. It is fresh, tender and not greasy or overcooked. Try it with a little hand-grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.\n\n So one night when you are wondering where to eat, saunter over to Sodini's. You will be treated wonderfully, leave with a belly full of good food and feel like you have just been to an Italian family's home for dinner. Just remember their motto: No decaf. No reservations. No dessert.

"], "author": "Rich H.", "review": "I've been going there for years, but this is the first time I've written a review.  Whenever I'm in North Beach looking for good, old-fashioned Italian food, I stop by Sodini's first.  It's a very popular place and the wait time is usually 30-45 minutes.  This is typical for the area and should be factored in if you or your party are starving.  I will say it is worth the wait.\n\nI told my friend about this place and she was interested in trying it.  She doesn't know the city that well so it was also an opportunity to explore the neighborhood.  As a native San Franciscan (born & raised) who lives outside the city for some time now, it's a treat go back.  The area is so rich in history and culture and I miss it so much.\n\nWe arrived there a little after 6:00 pm and was told by the hostess that there was a 30-45 minute.  As mentioned by other reviewers, she took a mobile phone number and told us she call when our table was ready.  I suggested we walk around my old stomping ground and maybe try to find a bar that wasn't too crowded.  It also gave me the chance to play tour guide.  As luck would have it, the hostess called back in 10 minutes saying she could seat us. \n\nWhat I love about Sodini's is the neighborhood feel and lack of pretension.  It's not trying to be anything but great, little restaurant.  What I love most is the food.  It succeeds on both counts.  You can tell if the food is going to be good or not by how the place smells.  Immediately, you smell the garlic with a hint of tomato sauce and you know it's going to good.  The place was packed, which was also a good sign.\n\nWe were sat right away and after a few minutes our server introduced herself and took our drink orders (my friend had a lemon drop & I had a pint of Anchor Steam).  While enjoying our drinks and reviewing the menu, I scanned the meals being enjoyed by the other patrons and everything looked so good.  I chose a very decadent Tortellini Carbonara.  This is one of my favorite Italian dishes--although I try to order it infrequently--and I hadn't had theirs in years.  Without a doubt, this one of the best I've every tried.  Carbonara sauce can be tricky because it's just the right combination of egg yolks, cheese, pancetta and black pepper.  Some places have screwed it up by adding non-traditional ingredients to it like bacon and/or sausage (c'mon, man).  Sodini's gets it right using only traditional ingredients.  The tortellini was cooked to perfection; nothing ruins a carbonara like overcooked pasta.  I literally could have eaten two entire plates.\n\nMy friend had the Tortellini all Panna and it too was fantastic.  Both of our dishes came with garlic bread and I only wish there was more.

Before even getting the opportunity to sit down and enjoy a meal here, we were made to feel so uncomfortable and disrespected we left. If you don't have time to read, check out Colosseo just right down the road instead. Otherwise, here you go. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were in North Beach looking to get some great Italian when we came upon Sodini's on Green St. The menu looked perfect and it didn't look to busy outside, so we stopped inside to try and get a table. We walked inside and it was fairly lively, but two tables were open and there weren't any signs as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait for a hostess. After a minute of waiting and a failed attempt at getting the bartender's attention, my girlfriend went over to one of the open tables where a gentleman was cleaning to find out if there was a list we needed to put on, or if we should just sit down.\n\nI remained standing close to the bar, where you first walk in, just in case a waitress or hostess emerged to help seat us. This is when shit hit the fan. A waitress walked over to the line that was beginning to form, grabbed what I presume was the wait list, and if looks could kill, my girlfriend would have dropped dead on the spot. In the most rude and snide voice I've heard from a waitress in a long time, she said out loud (not knowing that who she was talking about was my girlfriend), \"Um, what is she doing? Who is that? She can't do that.\" \n\nI told her, \"She's trying to see how to get a table.\" The waitress chimed again, full volume, \"She needs to get back here. What is she doing.\" When my girlfriend came over, the waitress saidvin an incredibly rude voice (I really can't stress this enough), with her eyebrows arched, \"Um, can I help you?\" We told her, again, we were simply trying to get a table. I'm not sure if she misunderstood me and thought I was trying to rob the place, but as defensive as possible, embarrassing my girlfriend in front of everyone, we were told there was a 20 minute wait, and we'd have to wait our turn. At this time, another waitress came by and told us to \"get out of the way.\" We were literally standing in the only spot you could stand and try and get help. \n\nThat's when I lost it. We were fully prepared for a big night out, on vacation, to get a nice meal, order drinks and tip well. I told the bartender to take us off the list, but that I wanted to personally tell the waitress that it was because of her that we were leaving. What would a normal customer service reaction be in this situation? \"Oh, no, don't leave! I'm so sorry you're upset.\" Nope. Her eyebrows shot up, her face got squished, and she was bewildered we'd want to tell the woman who embarrassed us that we were leaving. \n\nWhen the first girl came back, I told her what happened. I told her that my girlfriend had stepped outside from embarrassment and didn't feel comfortable staying because of how we had just been treated. Suddenly, she was defensive. She very un-genuinely apologetic and said she was \"just confused\" and we shouldn't leave. No, in reality, she didn't realize that when she was talking aloud about my girlfriend getting a table, that she literally said it TO the person she was with. The mean face she shot the random guy waiting in line? Yeah, I was with her. I was very clear --\u00a0you do not talk to customers like that, and that I was dumbfounded in how she had made us feel. \n\nNever in my life have I encountered such a hostel experience trying to get a table. Here's a few tips, as I have too run a kitchen, worked in an Italian restaurant, managed a kitchen, worked as a server and felt the rush that can happen all day every day in a restaurant: \n\n1. Don't talk badly about customers to other customers. You don't know who they may be with. \n\n2. Your face and voice say more than your voice ever will. I won't pretend to remember verbatim how our exchange went, but the gist of it was just plain mean, rude and uncalled for. If you aren't at the door to greet the line of customers waiting for you, and it's too hard to put up a single sign that says \"wait to be seated,\" don't be surprised if - god forbid - someone attempts to figure out how to get a table. Arching your eyebrows, getting a tone and saying, \"Um, what is SHE doing?\" like someone just spit on your shoes is a bit uncalled for. \n\nWe ended up leaving and waking down the street to Colosseo. Absolutely stunning meal. The service, from the second we walked up outside, was nothing but warm and inviting. They started giving us recommendations on the spot. The meal was top notch and everyone from the greeter, to our server, to the gentleman who refilled our drinks was kind, warm and thankful. It was a great experience. \n\nSkip this place.

They're friendly and direct - and get the job done.  They've also got excellent memories, so if you frequent it often, you'll get a nod of recognition and be greeted even more warmly. On occasion, if there's a wait, we've been pleasantly surprised by a glass of wine offered up.\n\nthe food:  the menu is solid and the food is good; though given dishes are always better than others, I typically opt for the NY Steak with the calamari starter and have never been disappointed.

"], "author": "Mike C.", "review": "My friend from the 808 requested a weeknight Italian restaurant choice and this was it (are there any Italian and Mexican restaurants on Oahu?). Reading reviews of Megan D and Natalie I, this seemed like the logical place. Interestingly painted in green (something to do with the national flag?), it certainly isn't difficult to find. When you enter, the bar is on the right and the main dining room (about eight to ten tables) is to the left. Being only a party of two, the hostess was kind and understanding in seating us at a center table for four (we're pretty big guys!). After reviewing the menu and getting our bread basket with olive oil, my eyes wandered about the dining room. Behind me, I noticed a makeshift stage above with ceramic statues of Sammy, Frank, and Dean. Lined across the far left wall were various clippings, posters, and photographs of these three too... see a recurring theme? There was one photo of Tony Manero (aka John Travolta in his white suit). Directly to the rear of the dining room, the kitchen was open with several people busily preparing the meals. It turned out that my visiting friend ate here during his last trip, so the menu was his choice. Here is what we shared: \nAppetizer: \na) Fried Calamari - Thickly coated calamari meat pieces, fried and served with two Marinara and tartar sauce. The calamari meat was of good quality, but my preference is a mixture with the curly (tentacles) parts too. The batter was bland, hence the need for the two sauces. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=pM2_u3npUaXL7u8_i2wKKw) \nEntrees: \nb) Tortellini Carbonara - Cheese filled tortellini dumplings filled with ricotta cheese in a heavy cream sauce with small pancetta cubes and white mushroom slices. Filling and generous portions. As always, love my plentiful mushrooms.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=6lrMV9twcEDcX2EgjY-tXA) \nc) Linguine with Clams, White Sauce - Made with fresh in-shell clams, this is another hearty pasta sauce, using a cream sauce with lemon garnish. Definitely, not for someone looking for a light dinner.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=YW9Zh2TmWt-Cz-yI0qlUbA) \nSide order \nd) Meatballs - Two freshly made meatballs in a savory Marinara sauce. Meatball flavor had a heavy celery (?) or other veggie flavor, but was a good pace change from the above choices (ordered after seeing other tables getting this - see-food diet!). \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=qtRMgrLpdbW13IbgQc8NTg) \n\nBoth pasta dishes came with a small slice of garlic bread, perfect for sopping up the remaining sauce(s).

I flagged down another employee (He was working the bar at the time, but gave me the impression that he was the manager) who seemed rather annoyed at the fact that we had three separate cards. I tried to explain to him the situation, but he immediately saw me as an annoyance and quickly proceeded to give me an attitude, saying, and I quote, \"This is why we have ATMs around the corner\". Much confusion ensued as I tried to understand his frustration but *never* have I been so rudely treated by a restaurant employee, let alone the manager. \n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nMy first experience at Sodini's was left feeling sour and maltreated. We were ignored by the staff, and when we finally got some acknowledgement, it backfired. The manager (or whoever he was) was rude, and insisted on starting an argument.

I usually can't associate fancy places with Italian restaurants, to me it just doesn't happen. So I decided to check this place out when I read in Yelp that this is a true Italian restaurant with authentic food. \n\nIndeed, the environment is as authentic as it can be. Low lights, small crowded place with cheerful waitresses and hostess. My husband and I were meeting two other friends there for dinner this last Saturday, hoping that we could go after dinner check out the 4th of July fireworks in Marina. To make that happen, my friends arrived in the restaurant a little before 7pm. We only made it at 8pm, but we didn't get sit before 8:30pm anyways, so that was a 1,5hs waiting. If I was the one waiting there I am sure it would have made my experience a lot different... but anyways, the bartender was pretty nice to my friend, offering her a garlic bread that was very tasteful.\n\nWhen we got to our table, the service was very efficient and fast even though the restaurant was very crowded. And again, our waitress was all smiles. We ordered the clams and mussels for appetizer and we shared it amongst 3 people. It was delicious with the garlic bread that they brought to the table once again. We also ordered polenta, but I thought it was plain. \n\nFor the appetizer I was pretty set on fusili, but there weren't many appealing sauces to me. I am a red sauce person with tomato chunks and other chunky stuff to go with it, but it just didn't exist in the menu. You would think italian food can be very versatile, allowing you to mix and match different sauces to pastas, but it wasn't the case at this restaurant. So I ended up choosing the white creamy sauce fusili with prawns. My first disappointment was that the pasta wasn't home made (at least didn't taste anything special) and the sauce was pretty plain and tasteless.\n\nEven though I wasn't very excited about my dish, I would give this restaurant another try for a couple of reasons: everybody there is pretty friendly and they do a good job in creating an italian atmosphere in the restaurant, I am curious to try their pesto nhoqui, their house wine is pretty good and I didn't have to wait 90 minutes to get a table at my first time! ;)", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-07-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Linda was a phenomal server and Ana served up a great time at the bar.
