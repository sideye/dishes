It was a great combo of flavors and reminded me of ahi poke. Don't expect a large tray of chips though it comes with 4 small servings.\n\nFor the sushi we tried the Ya Man Roll ($12) which was salmon and unique flavors of fried red onion chips, pesto and ponzu. The waiter said this was one of their most popular rolls and it ended up being my favorite. The other highlight of the meal was the flaming seabass roll ($16). Everyone seemed to be getting this! They wrap the roll in aluminum foil in a dish with vodka and light it on fire for about 10 minutes to cook. It was super saucy and baked when it was done. Highly recommend you try it!\n\nAlso got the double albacore roll (very good but nothing too memorable) and unagi roll $10 (large servings of tender eel but not as flavorful as the other rolls).

Once the flames die down, we were pleasantly surprised with a flame-grilled sea bass and flanking the sushi roll -- and it was DELISH\n\n3. Walu Sashimi - this fish was so rich, tender, and savory that it didn't feel like fish at all; rather, it tasted like game hen or chicken. A fabulous sashimi dish for those of us disinclined towards to the straight up raw meat \n\n4. Himalayan Trout - I'm not one for sashimi, but the way this meat was cured (with himalayan rock salt and garlic ponzu among other things) made it simply excellent\n\n5. Albacore Tuna Roll - the hint of honey mustard and the plentiful meat in this dish makes it savory with a little kick - love this. \n\n6. They made us an ice cream sushi dessert that was just mind blowing - probably one of the top 5 desserts I've had in the city \n\nThe service is friendly and very accommodating (thank you for all that iced water ;) ), a bit overwhelmed though (probably one of their first Friday nights).

What a welcome addition to Hyde Street and the general void in the Nob/Russian/North Beach area between cheap, questionably fresh sushi and ultra-pricey, 'is that really a roll?' spots like Okoze across the street. \n\nElephant Sushi is amazing. Service was very attentive - though we went early (6 pm) and the whole space was filled by the time we left 1.5 hours later. Our waiter was helpful in letting us know what the more popular dishes were on the menu, and within 5 minutes of sitting down one of the chefs behind the sushi bar sent out a sea bass/pepper/ponzu sashimi plate (the Suzuki) on the house. Pair that with the discovery of a $2 sake bomb all night happy hour, as well as their amazing house-made ginger & soy sauce, and dinner was off to a great start.\n\nWe ordered the Crudo starter, double hamachi roll, assorted sashimi and the flaming sea bass, and all four were outstanding. I'm not the biggest fan of truffle oil, as most applications overpower whatever else you're trying to eat, but the hamachi truffle combo in the Crudo was done well. The scallops used for the Crudo, paired with a few drops of fresh lemon juice, were possibly my favorite flavors of the night.\n\nThe sashimi, as all other reviews have already covered, is outstanding - huge cuts of fish sliced expertly, and so fresh you can almost taste the ocean. To give you a sense of the freshness of the fish each night, we arrived right as they opened and the two chefs behind the counter were unwrapping dozens of just-packaged fillets straight from the market before arranging them under the glass.\n\nFinal notes - the double hamachi & flaming sea bass are so drastically different from each other that it's hard to compare, but if getting the flaming sea bass I'd recommend saving it for last as it's a much bolder combo of flavors than the lighter fish-focused rolls.

Not to brag, just to bring some perspective.\n15 years living in Japan, eating raw fish almost 24/7.\nI'm a sushi freak, but not a snob. \n\nSo when you have a Yelper saying, \"You won't find fresher fish anywhere.\" (I won't mention any names.) You have to realize that maybe that Yelper just got introduced to sushi recently. And to him or her, Elephant Sushi *is* the best fish that he/she has ever put in his/her mouth .\n\nContrast that with someone like me, who has been eating sushi in the Land of the Rising Sun since the early 80's.  Again, not to brag, but just to make the point, it makes a big difference to know the background and experience of a food reviewer before you swallow hook, line and sinker.  That goes for all food, not just sushi.  Experience counts when you're looking for an opinion. Just sayin.  \n\nMy daughter was born in Japan and knows her sushi stuff pretty well too.  She was with us at Elephant and made this comment about their fish:\n\n\"Dad, they don't know how to cut fish here.\"\n\nShe was right.  The way they cut the fish at Elephant was not maximizing the taste and texture of the fish (I have also worked at a sushi bar.)\n\nWe were very lucky to be seated as walk-ins.  Hostess said it was very rare.  We were an odd 3 people and they had a spot that worked for only us in the line.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nYELLOW FIN BITES (3/5)  Not bad, not good, just middle of the road.\n\nHAMACHI W/TRUFFLE  (4/5)  Probably the best of the bunch.  It had garlic chips and green onion.  It was a good twist on the usual trendy thing they're doing these days adding the jalape\u00f1o. I think Nobu in LA originated the hamachi/jalapeno combo.\n\nYA MAN ROLL (3/5)  Salmon cut a bit too thick for me.  But I liked the concept of red onion chips and pesto thrown in for good measure.  Still, flavors got too busy for me and the fish was no longer the star of the show.\n\nWe also had an assortment of nigiri which included:  MAGURO, HAMACHI, SALMON AND WALU (which is the Hawaiian word for ESCOLAR) which is basically a kind of tuna.  Different sushi places will call fish by different names and it can be confusing.  What is even more confusing is when sushi restaurants will mislabel their fish (sometimes deliberately and sometimes ignorantly) depending on the fish and how they want to market it to the customer. For example, some sushi chef might think it's more appealing to call it \"butterfish\"rather than its common name \"escolar\".  If I were a sushi chef, I think I'd opt to call it \"butterfish\" too just because it sounds more appetizing than the former.  Let's not forget too that some chefs will deliberately (and fraudulently) call a cheap fish by a different name just to make it sound expensive.  Wow, I got off on a tangent here.\n\nAnyway, I think there's def some hype going on here with ES.  I think, if you're not a spoiled sushi eater, you're likely to have a good experience here.  But if you've been around the block in terms of sushi-eating experience, then I would say you're not going to find your happy face here.\n\nI haven't been there in a long time, but look up KABUTO restaurant for some off-the-chart sushi goodness.

I can also declare that this is probably one of the better (if not the BEST) Sushi joints in San Franciso. \n\nI took the Wifey here for her birthday dinner and I quickly realized that I should have made a reservation. In my defense, she picked me up from work and wanted to go out for dinner and my birthday plans for her was for the next day. Yeah...no excuses.  \n\nIt was a Friday evening, May 9th to be exact and the wind was biting; typical San Francisco weather and the line was out the door. The wait was over an hour and a half, but it didn't faze the Wifey. Parking is also a pain, but I don't care. I ended up parking four blocks away. Take note that the Cable Car runs in front of the place for those of you who are not willing to drive and battle traffic.\n\nWhile we were waiting, we were scrolling at the food pics, which made us hungrier and hungrier. By the time our name was called, it was under an hour a half wait but over an hour, and it was totally worth the wait. \n\nWe sat at the Sushi Bar and we got the coolest, laid-back and friendliest server we've ever encountered. I forgot his name, but he had long, curly hair and had that Japanese Surfer vibe to him. Told him it was the Wifey's birthday and he got her a free drink; it was a Hello Kitty Martini. \n\nThe Sushi Chef then gave us two pieces of Butterfish Sashimi as a FREE appetizer. Not only was it FREE, but it was HELLA good. It was well-balanced dish from taste to contrasting texture. It was so clean and fresh and the Fried Garlic Chips added a level of contrast and taste that made me do the happy dance. I knew that we were in for a treat. \n\nBased on Ethan Z's reviews, who was the first Yelper that highly recommended this place to us, we ordered the following:\n\nFlaming Seabass - Sushi roll served in a foil cooked in flame on your table\nHimalayan Trout - New Zealand Ocean Trout cured on a Himalayan Rock Salt\nYa Man Roll - King Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Fried Red Onion Chips, Pesto and Ponzu\nBoom Box - Japanese Spicy Scallops, Avocado, Garlic Chips, Cucumber wrapped in Banana\nRainbow Roll - Assorted Fresh Fish\nBeastie Boys - Uni, Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Quail Eggs and Shiso Leaf\n\nThe Boom Box was a surprise since who would have thought banana wouldn't go together with scallops, let alone mixing it as a sushi ingredient? It wasn't too sweet, but the contrast of sweet and spicy was at work again balancing it off. \n\nThe Himalayan Trout was on a bed of rock salt that was seasoned lightly with sea salt. You didn't need to add soy sauce to add some flavor as the dishes were left shining on their own with the high level of freshenss and quality. This was also true for the Ya Man Roll. There was a nice theme of contrasting flavor and texture that were nicely married to form a union. \n\nFor the Flaming Seabass, you had to wait a while until it's cooked and had to time it precisely in order to get the best experience. Our server told us exactly when to eat it as it was still hot and told us not to let it cool off. I love how some of the rice became crunchy and I was happily digging them from the foil and popping them straight to our mouth. \n\nAnd for the Rainbow Roll, there's nothing more to add except to say that everyhing was fresh. This would be a great roll by itself if served in other sushi joints, \n\nAs for the Beastie Boys....I saved the BEST for last. I can honestly say that this was the BEST sushi I've ever placed in my mouth. The combination of Uni, Monkfish Liver, Quail Egg and Shiso Leaf was a delectable experience that hit my tastebuds like a frontal assault of umami goodness.

I immediately became very excited because I knew if that one little piece of fish was THAT good, then the food to come was going to be amazing.

Very similar to a baked lion king roll, the Flaming Sea Bass comes out on a flaming bowl, wrapped in foil, and is cooked right in front of you. Creamy, decadent, and a little bit sweet. If there's a ton of rice stuck to your foil at the end, ask your server for a spoon to scrape the tasty burnt bits!\n\n- Monkfish Liver (Nigiri): The liver was mild in flavor and had the texture of pate.

I knew that we were in for a treat. \n\nBased on Ethan Z's reviews, who was the first Yelper that highly recommended this place to us, we ordered the following:\n\nFlaming Seabass - Sushi roll served in a foil cooked in flame on your table\nHimalayan Trout - New Zealand Ocean Trout cured on a Himalayan Rock Salt\nYa Man Roll - King Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Fried Red Onion Chips, Pesto and Ponzu\nBoom Box - Japanese Spicy Scallops, Avocado, Garlic Chips, Cucumber wrapped in Banana\nRainbow Roll - Assorted Fresh Fish\nBeastie Boys - Uni, Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Quail Eggs and Shiso Leaf\n\nThe Boom Box was a surprise since who would have thought banana wouldn't go together with scallops, let alone mixing it as a sushi ingredient? It wasn't too sweet, but the contrast of sweet and spicy was at work again balancing it off. \n\nThe Himalayan Trout was on a bed of rock salt that was seasoned lightly with sea salt. You didn't need to add soy sauce to add some flavor as the dishes were left shining on their own with the high level of freshenss and quality. This was also true for the Ya Man Roll. There was a nice theme of contrasting flavor and texture that were nicely married to form a union. \n\nFor the Flaming Seabass, you had to wait a while until it's cooked and had to time it precisely in order to get the best experience. Our server told us exactly when to eat it as it was still hot and told us not to let it cool off. I love how some of the rice became crunchy and I was happily digging them from the foil and popping them straight to our mouth. \n\nAnd for the Rainbow Roll, there's nothing more to add except to say that everyhing was fresh. This would be a great roll by itself if served in other sushi joints, \n\nAs for the Beastie Boys....I saved the BEST for last. I can honestly say that this was the BEST sushi I've ever placed in my mouth. The combination of Uni, Monkfish Liver, Quail Egg and Shiso Leaf was a delectable experience that hit my tastebuds like a frontal assault of umami goodness. It was silky, creamy and smooth and went down like the finest vintage wine that's over a hundred years old. \n\nWOW, simply amazing experience.\n\nI know where I'll be eating on my birthday.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-05-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Beastie Boys - 2.5 stars \n$2 sake bombs - 5 stars!!\n\n", "I was a bit disappointed by the Beastie Boys since I read from so many yelpers that it was an amazing roll.

The restaurant is small, but the tables are spaced in a way that you don't feel like the next table is sitting on your lap. The wait staff is genuinely friendly and not snobby, which can be rare in popular restaurants.\n\nOnto the food -- while we were waiting, we saw a flaming roll on every table (the flaming sea bass), so we thought we should definitely give it a try. We also ordered the beastie boys (negiri of uni, monkfish liver and raw quail egg) and the spicy hamachi.\n\nOur waitress brought us a sample of two slices of barely seared butterfish with a truffle oil and ponzu sauce topped with fried onions. I've never had butterfish, and wow, where have you been all my life?! The fish tasted so fresh and is soft and just melted in my mouth. There was only a hint of truffle oil, so not to overwhelm the other flavors. Definitely 10/10! A very promising start of our dinner.\n\nNext up we got the spicy hamachi and the beastie boys. The hamachi actually wasn't spicy (it's supposed to have some jalapenos), but the fish was so fresh. There was a bit of ponzu that added some acidity and the avocado gave it more creaminess. There was a bit of cucumber for crunch to complete the roll. There were 8 pieces in the roll and it was a fattie. I like a bit more texture to rice in sushi rolls and the rice was slightly on the mushy side, so I gave it 8/5/10. \n\nThe beastie boys, in my opinion, is the best bite in SF. It's even better than the Scotched eggs from the Cavalier, and that's saying a lot. You gotta eat the whole thing in one bite. I don't think I ever had monk fish liver before and the flavor reminds me a bit of foie gras. It was rich, firm (but not hard) and creamy. The sea urchin was sweet and just a bit of brininess, very fresh. The quail egg yoke added more richness to the dish. IT'S A MUST ORDER!!\n\nThe flaming sea bass was roasting over the bowl for around 8 minutes. Our waitress helped us open it up and plate it after the flame went out. It's kind of like the lion king roll, I think. I thought it was too much teriyaki that overpowered the fish. It just tasted like a dollop of teriyaki sauce over rice. I couldn't taste the fish at all. \n\nAll in all, we loved our experience and hope to be back soon. The staff is so friendly, always a smile and the food is just amazing.

Judging from the decor and ambiance, the restaurant feels rather hip and trendy.  It's small, so you might want to make a reservation or go right when they open for dinner to avoid waiting.\n\nI highly recommend getting:\n\n1. The White Out Roll - Yellowtail & avocado roll topped with seared butter fish & garlic ponzu sauce. It literally melts in your mouth. You'll wonder why other foods can't be like this.  They just can't\n\n2. Scallop Nigiri - Super fresh & slightly sweet. This also just melts in your mouth.  Other nigiri that I've tried here have also been great, but the scallop is the most memorable. I normally get two orders!\n\n3. Truffle Hamachi - Come on. Hamachi in truffle oil, topped with fried garlic? Amazing.\n\n4. Kobe Dragon Roll - Seared Kobe beef, on a roll. What's not to like?\n\nThe Godzilla Roll receives an honorable mention. It's shrimp tempura wrapped in tuna, sitting in some spicy sauce (siracha? I can't remember).  The beastie boys are worth trying, but I'm not sure if I would get them again.  A lot of flavors, some great, some not so great. Loved the uni, quail egg & shiso leaf, but there was one other thing in there that was just meh.\n\nAnyway, if you're in Nob Hill, and looking for a moderately priced sushi dinner, this might be the spot for you.

I remembered telling her, \"this place looked familiar.\" Then it dawned on me that this was the restaurant I practically camped out at in the late 90s, it was one of those date restaurants and I was in my early to mid 20s, which made this place ideal because it was convenient and suitably date-worthy.\n\nWhile the name and presumably, ownership, has changed, and there were approx. 17/18 years of time in between my old and new memories, this place remained to be a a date -worthy neighborhood restaurant. It consistently offers a quality sushi bar with nice array of drinks to compliment the food. In 1998, lichee sake cocktails was in, it would appear that it had since made a nice come back. The renovated model was clearly updated, the clientele remained youngish, and the service remained professional. I continue to enjoy the bar seating,  which, as any sushi aficionado will tell you, is the only place to sit when enjoying sushi. I like this born again version more, perhaps because the memories created since the change-over seemed more relevant. The ginger in a jar and help yourself model works for me. The quality of sushi seemed to have improved, in my opinion. I would stay with the nigiri because good sushi needs no sauce. The fusion side of the offering in this restaurant is enticing enough, rolls are filled with ample fish and delightful sauces. The fanciful ones with flame always seemed to please the patrons. \n\nI never had to order when coming here. The person I'm usually with has been a long term patron like me since the late 90s as well, and has practically the same exact taste as I when it comes to sushi. He does the ordering, I do the eating. Pretty simple and hassle free. A good test for a decent sushi restaurant is the freshness of uni, and I noticed he tends to always order that wherever we go out for sushi, which we had been doing for as long as we have known each other. This to me is the place that had the very best uni, and they tell you up front that it's a one bite nigiri. Don't attempt to be lady like when consume beastie boys and / or uni nigiri, or you'd look anything but a lady after. \n\nWe never had to wait and there is always a good chance that we could be in and out in an hour, as the service is very prompt, so that we could get on with the rest of our evening without feeling that we had spent the entire evening waiting to get served. \n\nAnd of course this being a place I frequented in my 20s, does not hurt either.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-10-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Beastie boys  - This is what you came for!

Cut it too thin and just tasted like regular tuna.\nThe beastie boys was quite good however, a bomb of richness and flavour in one bite! \n\nContinued with the red and yellow roll (not memorable at all as I had to look up what I had ordered in the menu...) and the flaming seabass. The seabass was delicious, rish and creamy sauce served warm. \nWe also had the white out roll but I can't remember what it tasted like to give a constructive feedback. \n\nBeing the bottomless pits we are, we were still hungry after this and wanted to order some more rolls. However, we were advised that the kitchen had run out of rice for the night and only sashimis and salads were available. Disapointed, but still hungry, we opted to try their mix sashimi plate (nothing out of the ordinanry from any other sushi joint, can't say it was fresher than what we are used to back home) and the anago (which was served without rice but very tasty nonetheless). \n\nOverall, it was a enjoayble experience given we were on vacation and got to enjoy a rice stroll in Russian hill. Some of the dishes were quite good (beastie boys, flaming seabass and anago), but the rest were just ok. Maybe it's just us who were too hyped out about getting the 'freshiest sushi ever' but it was not any different from the places we go to back home in terms of fish quality.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-06-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Flaming Sea Bass roll, Hamachi truffle, beastie boys, and the White out roll.

So yes all the reviews are correct in that this place has the longest line ever when you show up with no reservations. They do take reservations but its only for a very specific period of time so if you want to avoid all the waiting, there is an option for you. The surrounding area is a nice neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant is no different. It is definitely on the small side hence the wait but the d\u00e9cor is nice. I will say that given it's a tiny place, its definitely on the louder side for a restaurant but that's just indicative of the place being filled up so quickly because the food is solid. \n\nI thought this place overall had great rolls and different combination ideas for the sushi. I was pretty pleased but let me not get too ahead of myself. We obviously ordered the hot sake (how could you not) and started firing through food orders. We ordered the Flaming Sea Bass roll, Hamachi truffle, beastie boys, and the White out roll. This place first starts you off with some house made ginger which is pretty delish. We received the Hamachi first which was a solid performer... probably not the best ive had but definitely worth the nod. The White out roll came out next which is really solid. Its very simple and fresh but just absolute solid dish. The Flaming Sea Bass roll was next and of course the presentation was fun to watch. I really did enjoy this roll but the sauces and everything was a bit too much for me personally.

I am a big fan of uni and the combination that they topped this off was just a great treat.

Great aroma, good balance, crunchy garlic. \n* Naked Scallop Roll: Fresh creamy scallops, spicy masago, nutty finish. \n* Beastie boys: Wonderful union of raw quail egg, uni, and ankimo. The shiso leaf provides a pleasant herbal quality while chewing. \n* Uni nigiri: wanted a little more uni, we were not disappointed. \n* Basil Salmon nigiri: Not usually a fusion fan, but this worked for me. \n* Hamachi scallion roll: a little too dense, but good fish and flavor. \n* White out: Br\u00fbl\u00e9ed butterfish on top gives a smoky finish to this meaty and satisfying roll. \n* Spicy hamachi: Surprisingly citrusy and refreshing. Not the usual mashed fish + hot sauce. \n* Scallop nigiri: They sneak a little wasabi and yuzu in there. You will enjoy it. \n\nSo yeah, we tried some food. We liked everything they put in front of us. We will be back.\n\nCondescending side note: check out the 1-star reviews for this place and you'll find some baffled Yelpers wondering why there isn't a California roll or Unagi here. They are correct that Elephant is not traditional. It's an innovative sushi bistro. At the same time, the tightly packed rice balls of canned crab these reviewers are looking for so they can dunk them in soy sauce and wasabi, are not traditional either. Neither is the bought-in, precooked eel, smothered in sugar sauce so unfortunately ubiquitous on sushi menus. If you have a place to go for those (like, say, Safeway) then I encourage you to go there instead. This place is for all people who like good food, and are looking for a break from the norm.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["But look at our other overpriced items, don't they have COOL names like BEASTIE BOYS ROLLS!\" \n\n"], "author": "Francois C.", "review": "We went to Elephant Sushi after seeing all the rave reviews this place just had.

Service was very attentive - though we went early (6 pm) and the whole space was filled by the time we left 1.5 hours later. Our waiter was helpful in letting us know what the more popular dishes were on the menu, and within 5 minutes of sitting down one of the chefs behind the sushi bar sent out a sea bass/pepper/ponzu sashimi plate (the Suzuki) on the house. Pair that with the discovery of a $2 sake bomb all night happy hour, as well as their amazing house-made ginger & soy sauce, and dinner was off to a great start.\n\nWe ordered the Crudo starter, double hamachi roll, assorted sashimi and the flaming sea bass, and all four were outstanding.

The scallops used for the Crudo, paired with a few drops of fresh lemon juice, were possibly my favorite flavors of the night.\n\nThe sashimi, as all other reviews have already covered, is outstanding - huge cuts of fish sliced expertly, and so fresh you can almost taste the ocean. To give you a sense of the freshness of the fish each night, we arrived right as they opened and the two chefs behind the counter were unwrapping dozens of just-packaged fillets straight from the market before arranging them under the glass.\n\nFinal notes - the double hamachi & flaming sea bass are so drastically different from each other that it's hard to compare, but if getting the flaming sea bass I'd recommend saving it for last as it's a much bolder combo of flavors than the lighter fish-focused rolls. Both were incredible, though I enjoyed the Hamachi more, and the portions are generous for the price.\n\nI think my GF said it best in her comment card: 'Elephant Sushi, I love you.

In my defense, she picked me up from work and wanted to go out for dinner and my birthday plans for her was for the next day. Yeah...no excuses.  \n\nIt was a Friday evening, May 9th to be exact and the wind was biting; typical San Francisco weather and the line was out the door. The wait was over an hour and a half, but it didn't faze the Wifey. Parking is also a pain, but I don't care. I ended up parking four blocks away. Take note that the Cable Car runs in front of the place for those of you who are not willing to drive and battle traffic.\n\nWhile we were waiting, we were scrolling at the food pics, which made us hungrier and hungrier. By the time our name was called, it was under an hour a half wait but over an hour, and it was totally worth the wait. \n\nWe sat at the Sushi Bar and we got the coolest, laid-back and friendliest server we've ever encountered. I forgot his name, but he had long, curly hair and had that Japanese Surfer vibe to him. Told him it was the Wifey's birthday and he got her a free drink; it was a Hello Kitty Martini. \n\nThe Sushi Chef then gave us two pieces of Butterfish Sashimi as a FREE appetizer. Not only was it FREE, but it was HELLA good. It was well-balanced dish from taste to contrasting texture. It was so clean and fresh and the Fried Garlic Chips added a level of contrast and taste that made me do the happy dance. I knew that we were in for a treat. \n\nBased on Ethan Z's reviews, who was the first Yelper that highly recommended this place to us, we ordered the following:\n\nFlaming Seabass - Sushi roll served in a foil cooked in flame on your table\nHimalayan Trout - New Zealand Ocean Trout cured on a Himalayan Rock Salt\nYa Man Roll - King Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Fried Red Onion Chips, Pesto and Ponzu\nBoom Box - Japanese Spicy Scallops, Avocado, Garlic Chips, Cucumber wrapped in Banana\nRainbow Roll - Assorted Fresh Fish\nBeastie Boys - Uni, Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Quail Eggs and Shiso Leaf\n\nThe Boom Box was a surprise since who would have thought banana wouldn't go together with scallops, let alone mixing it as a sushi ingredient? It wasn't too sweet, but the contrast of sweet and spicy was at work again balancing it off. \n\nThe Himalayan Trout was on a bed of rock salt that was seasoned lightly with sea salt. You didn't need to add soy sauce to add some flavor as the dishes were left shining on their own with the high level of freshenss and quality. This was also true for the Ya Man Roll. There was a nice theme of contrasting flavor and texture that were nicely married to form a union. \n\nFor the Flaming Seabass, you had to wait a while until it's cooked and had to time it precisely in order to get the best experience. Our server told us exactly when to eat it as it was still hot and told us not to let it cool off. I love how some of the rice became crunchy and I was happily digging them from the foil and popping them straight to our mouth. \n\nAnd for the Rainbow Roll, there's nothing more to add except to say that everyhing was fresh. This would be a great roll by itself if served in other sushi joints, \n\nAs for the Beastie Boys....I saved the BEST for last. I can honestly say that this was the BEST sushi I've ever placed in my mouth.

Himalayan Trout - I'm not one for sashimi, but the way this meat was cured (with himalayan rock salt and garlic ponzu among other things) made it simply excellent\n\n5.

We have our go to (cheaper) sushi place we frequent regularly, but Elephant Sushi is our special occasion sushi place.  Tip #1: They take reservations for the first seating, but you have to call when they're open to make a reservation.  They aren't on OpenTable and you can't leave a message.  Get there when they open the doors and you won't have to wait.  Also they will not seat you unless your whole party is there.  I totally understand this policy.  It's a small place and they need to turn the tables.  They can't have someone sitting there not ordering because they are waiting for the rest of their party.  So plan ahead.  Tip #2: Take public transit or a cab, parking is tough in that neighborhood.  Enough logistics, on to the food.\n\nFlaming Sea Bass.  AMAZING!  Himalayan Trout on salt slab.  DELICIOUS!

We decided that we were going to share things, so we went with the Hamachi Truffle, Yummy Pocket, Naked Scallop Roll, and the Godzilla.\n\nMy conclusions on just about every single one of the dishes were that nothing here impressed me.

While we were were finishing the Godzilla, we noticed that we hadn't been sitting in our seats for more than 30 minutes before coming to the end of dinner.  That's how fast food was coming out.

Not more than 3 minutes later, a small scoop of ice cream showed up as we were trying to finish our fish items.  Yuck. SO yuck. The last thing I want on my palate is tuna and then banana ice cream.  Midway through the weird ice cream/fish experience, our waitress dropped off the check, which was a sign for GTFO.  \n\nWe couldn't leave fast enough. I most definitely will not be returning here.

The White Out Roll - Yellowtail & avocado roll topped with seared butter fish & garlic ponzu sauce. It literally melts in your mouth. You'll wonder why other foods can't be like this.  They just can't\n\n2. Scallop Nigiri - Super fresh & slightly sweet. This also just melts in your mouth.  Other nigiri that I've tried here have also been great, but the scallop is the most memorable. I normally get two orders!\n\n3. Truffle Hamachi - Come on. Hamachi in truffle oil, topped with fried garlic? Amazing.\n\n4. Kobe Dragon Roll - Seared Kobe beef, on a roll. What's not to like?\n\nThe Godzilla Roll receives an honorable mention. It's shrimp tempura wrapped in tuna, sitting in some spicy sauce (siracha? I can't remember).  The beastie boys are worth trying, but I'm not sure if I would get them again.

I was pretty pleased but let me not get too ahead of myself. We obviously ordered the hot sake (how could you not) and started firing through food orders. We ordered the Flaming Sea Bass roll, Hamachi truffle, beastie boys, and the White out roll. This place first starts you off with some house made ginger which is pretty delish.

Its very simple and fresh but just absolute solid dish. The Flaming Sea Bass roll was next and of course the presentation was fun to watch.

She kindly explained that her and Tom opened the joint a little over a month ago in hopes of drawing in a loyal crowd. They decorated the space with hand-picked shells (laid out in fish motifs all over the walls), made unique chandeliers and used mixed wood for a casual, yet intimate vibe.\n\nNow onto the food- they have $2 sake bomb happy hours (which just sounds dangerous and reminiscent of my early and mid-20s in NYC), a delicious truffle hamachi amuse bouche (that was incredibly sizable) and an array of creative rolls and seafood. \n\nTheir food is FRESH. On top of innovative rolls, they also have incredible sashimi- generous portions of buttery goodness. I had the Walu, Salmon and Tuna last time I was there and I left craving more. I actually went back hoping to show my boyfriend the place but they are CLOSED on Mondays. Oh well, everybody's gotta rest. Mental note. \n\nThey are accommodating and warm and even ask customers to write reviews after dinner, which they post on their door. Talk about bringing Yelp to life! :)\n\nI'm really hoping that as their client and fan bases grow, they will continue to stick to the basics- simple and beautiful decor, a warm hospitable staff, and incredibly fresh and great deals on food. \n\nPretty please?", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-11-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Pair that with the discovery of a $2 sake bomb all night happy hour, as well as their amazing house-made ginger & soy sauce, and dinner was off to a great start.\n\n"], "author": "Alan C.", "review": "Woah. What a welcome addition to Hyde Street and the general void in the Nob/Russian/North Beach area between cheap, questionably fresh sushi and ultra-pricey, 'is that really a roll?' spots like Okoze across the street. \n\nElephant Sushi is amazing. Service was very attentive - though we went early (6 pm) and the whole space was filled by the time we left 1.5 hours later. Our waiter was helpful in letting us know what the more popular dishes were on the menu, and within 5 minutes of sitting down one of the chefs behind the sushi bar sent out a sea bass/pepper/ponzu sashimi plate (the Suzuki) on the house. Pair that with the discovery of a $2 sake bomb all night happy hour, as well as their amazing house-made ginger & soy sauce, and dinner was off to a great start.\n\nWe ordered the Crudo starter, double hamachi roll, assorted sashimi and the flaming sea bass, and all four were outstanding. I'm not the biggest fan of truffle oil, as most applications overpower whatever else you're trying to eat, but the hamachi truffle combo in the Crudo was done well. The scallops used for the Crudo, paired with a few drops of fresh lemon juice, were possibly my favorite flavors of the night.\n\nThe sashimi, as all other reviews have already covered, is outstanding - huge cuts of fish sliced expertly, and so fresh you can almost taste the ocean. To give you a sense of the freshness of the fish each night, we arrived right as they opened and the two chefs behind the counter were unwrapping dozens of just-packaged fillets straight from the market before arranging them under the glass.\n\nFinal notes - the double hamachi & flaming sea bass are so drastically different from each other that it's hard to compare, but if getting the flaming sea bass I'd recommend saving it for last as it's a much bolder combo of flavors than the lighter fish-focused rolls. Both were incredible, though I enjoyed the Hamachi more, and the portions are generous for the price.\n\nI think my GF said it best in her comment card: 'Elephant Sushi, I love you. Please don't change.' Assuming they maintain the portions, pricing, menu and momentum they've established in these first few months, I'll be looking forward to every meal here.

The scallop nigiri tasted way different than any other scallops I've ever had and I'm not sure why. Either it was amazing or it was not fresh but since I can't tell I'll just go with amazing.

I can also declare that this is probably one of the better (if not the BEST) Sushi joints in San Franciso. \n\nI took the Wifey here for her birthday dinner and I quickly realized that I should have made a reservation. In my defense, she picked me up from work and wanted to go out for dinner and my birthday plans for her was for the next day. Yeah...no excuses.  \n\nIt was a Friday evening, May 9th to be exact and the wind was biting; typical San Francisco weather and the line was out the door. The wait was over an hour and a half, but it didn't faze the Wifey. Parking is also a pain, but I don't care. I ended up parking four blocks away. Take note that the Cable Car runs in front of the place for those of you who are not willing to drive and battle traffic.\n\nWhile we were waiting, we were scrolling at the food pics, which made us hungrier and hungrier. By the time our name was called, it was under an hour a half wait but over an hour, and it was totally worth the wait. \n\nWe sat at the Sushi Bar and we got the coolest, laid-back and friendliest server we've ever encountered. I forgot his name, but he had long, curly hair and had that Japanese Surfer vibe to him. Told him it was the Wifey's birthday and he got her a free drink; it was a Hello Kitty Martini. \n\nThe Sushi Chef then gave us two pieces of Butterfish Sashimi as a FREE appetizer. Not only was it FREE, but it was HELLA good. It was well-balanced dish from taste to contrasting texture. It was so clean and fresh and the Fried Garlic Chips added a level of contrast and taste that made me do the happy dance. I knew that we were in for a treat. \n\nBased on Ethan Z's reviews, who was the first Yelper that highly recommended this place to us, we ordered the following:\n\nFlaming Seabass - Sushi roll served in a foil cooked in flame on your table\nHimalayan Trout - New Zealand Ocean Trout cured on a Himalayan Rock Salt\nYa Man Roll - King Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Fried Red Onion Chips, Pesto and Ponzu\nBoom Box - Japanese Spicy Scallops, Avocado, Garlic Chips, Cucumber wrapped in Banana\nRainbow Roll - Assorted Fresh Fish\nBeastie Boys - Uni, Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Quail Eggs and Shiso Leaf\n\nThe Boom Box was a surprise since who would have thought banana wouldn't go together with scallops, let alone mixing it as a sushi ingredient? It wasn't too sweet, but the contrast of sweet and spicy was at work again balancing it off. \n\nThe Himalayan Trout was on a bed of rock salt that was seasoned lightly with sea salt. You didn't need to add soy sauce to add some flavor as the dishes were left shining on their own with the high level of freshenss and quality. This was also true for the Ya Man Roll. There was a nice theme of contrasting flavor and texture that were nicely married to form a union. \n\nFor the Flaming Seabass, you had to wait a while until it's cooked and had to time it precisely in order to get the best experience. Our server told us exactly when to eat it as it was still hot and told us not to let it cool off. I love how some of the rice became crunchy and I was happily digging them from the foil and popping them straight to our mouth. \n\nAnd for the Rainbow Roll, there's nothing more to add except to say that everyhing was fresh. This would be a great roll by itself if served in other sushi joints, \n\nAs for the Beastie Boys....I saved the BEST for last. I can honestly say that this was the BEST sushi I've ever placed in my mouth. The combination of Uni, Monkfish Liver, Quail Egg and Shiso Leaf was a delectable experience that hit my tastebuds like a frontal assault of umami goodness.

The White Out Roll - Yellowtail & avocado roll topped with seared butter fish & garlic ponzu sauce. It literally melts in your mouth. You'll wonder why other foods can't be like this.

Hamachi in truffle oil, topped with fried garlic? Amazing.\n\n4. Kobe Dragon Roll - Seared Kobe beef, on a roll. What's not to like?\n\nThe Godzilla Roll receives an honorable mention. It's shrimp tempura wrapped in tuna, sitting in some spicy sauce (siracha? I can't remember).  The beastie boys are worth trying, but I'm not sure if I would get them again.
