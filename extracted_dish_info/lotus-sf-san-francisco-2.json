This is really a gem of a place! I loved everything about it - absolutely everything!\n\nWe'll start with the decor, because that's what strikes you first. It's just gorgeous in there, with its pinks and reds and sky-blue sky ceiling (yes, there are actual clouds painted on there!). Such a welcome relief from all the sad (in my opinion), yuppy, cookie-cutter restaurants with their drab, gray, box-y, cyber-y, minimalist decor. You won't find that here! Yes, this is a beautifully decorated place full of bright, happy colors that open your mind up and expand your mental and emotional horizons. The space used to belong to a tile company, so the whole floor is filled with colored tiles - it's so beautiful! All the art work comes from India and our waiter graciously explained all the different meanings and personalities contained in the works. It was really fascinating in itself!\n\nThen comes the food. It could not have been more perfect. First, for those who are gluten-free or have food allergies, you won't find a more welcoming menu. They have the option of gluten-free naan! When's the last time you were able to find *that*?! And they print right on their menu that they care about your health and are glad to make you any dish to order, including something that is your favorite Indian dish that you don't see on the menu! I was wildly excited to get to eat the vegetable pakoras appetizer because, being gluten-free, I don't get to indulge in fried food very often. But these are made with chick pea flour, so they are GF! And they were completely delicious. Our waiter also was careful to make all our dishes to our specifications, asking for us to tell him not just 'mild, medium or spicy' but, \"on a scale of 1-10, is 'medium' a 5 for you or is it a 7?\" We had the coconut chicken dish and the tikka masala (Yum! That was my favorite!) and they even offer brown rice for those who are more health conscious. Their vegetables are pesticide-free - they make a point of telling you that. It was very delicious, healthy food! You can't go wrong here.\n\nBut the most stellar, striking thing of all was the level of service we got. Amit was our server and he just had everything down perfectly! He had the perfect timing of knowing when to come refill our tea cups with yummy Masala chai and when to leave us alone to be engaged in deep conversation. When to bring the appetizer and when to bring the bill. He just could not have been nicer. He chatted with us and explained Indian history a little (brought about by our asking about the art on the walls). He was so knowledgeable and polite. He could not have been nicer and more welcoming.\n\nAnd so I say, \"Three cheers for this new neighborhood restaurant!\" They are open for lunch Tuesday - Sunday which is a plus since there aren't too many healthy, affordable lunch options around here. And yes, I forgot to mention that it is a restaurant that you can still eat at if you're not a millionaire. Very exciting for people like me. And, again, that decor! I'm just soooo thankful to see something new here that isn't black and gray and minimalist and boring! Reminded me of the old San Francisco, when everything had character.

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place from all the great Yelp reviews so we decided to come here for dinner on a Friday night. Upon our arrival we put out names down because it was so busy, but no surprise to us. We patiently waited until it was it turn to be seated. This is when things took a turn for the worst. We were seated and served water and then nothing. No one approached us. We watched tables around us being brought food, orders being taken, and then there was us. My boyfriend and I are pretty understanding, especially since it's a new restaurant, we get that they are still trying to workout a good system. After a 20 minute wait at our table my boyfriend called a server over and asked if we could put in our order & was told that someone would be right over and again we waited & waited. Keep in mind, it is busy, so all around us people are being waited, we did try to flag people down but we were simply ignored as they would just walk past us. Another 20 minutes go by, and if course at this point we have been contemplating walking out, but all the food around us makes us stay. I get up this time and go over to the host and let them know that we have been sitting at out table for 40 minutes and we would like to order. He goes and tells one of the waiters and points at our table. At this point we're thinking finally, so excited to put in our order and get some of that food, but the waiter doesn't come. The host noticed and actually came over and took it order himself. We were happy that things were finally moving along. About 20 minutes later we get out appetizer, and at this point we actually start seeing people leave that we're seated when we were. Boyfriend and I are happy to be eating. Then we sit and wait some more. I understand that the food I being freshly prepared, so we expected to wait, especially with it being so busy, but we were not expecting this. It took almost another 40 minutes for or main dishes to come out & they did not bring out that naan to us until about halfway through the meal. I know we could have left, and honestly we should have.

About nothing and everything. My BF and I felt bad, so we asked the server to get him a soda and some food, and put it on our tab. The server went in the kitchen and came back with a box of chicken, rice and water. The gentleman thanked him and left. The server came over and thanked us for our generosity and said it was his duty to take care of the community they were in, but more importantly the patrons inside that supported them. Wow, human kindness DOES exist. I was touched. This made me appreciate the restaurant even more, and all happened before we got our food.\n\nI salute the server, restaurant and what it stands for.
