Great flavor without coming off as fishy. And it was nice and creamy. The foie looked beautiful, but unfortunately it was rather thin and undercooked. It looked like they just lightly seared each side and served it to us. I guess I understand as the piece was so thin, it probably would have melted into nothing if seared any longer. But it was really disappointing as it was rather pricey for the size. The rest of the dishes were good. Not huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering family style.

I just ended up sampling everything. The steak was my fav, but that's because I love beef. The center slice was perfectly cooked for me as I love a rare steak. The pork actually looked dry at first, but was cooked to a nice medium, so the meat by the bone was super tender and juicy. I had a small piece of lamb and it was cooked nicely as well, but with two pieces, I found the serving to be on the smaller side.

It was good sweet ending to our meal. For the wine, we brought a bottle to cork and also ordered a bottle. Corkage is $25 per bottle for the first two, $35 per bottle afterwards. But for every bottle you buy, one corkage fee waived, so we ordered a bottle. I didn't notice until I was writing this review, but the wine was listed for $48 on their menu. We were overcharged by $8 (plus tax, SF Health, etc), so I guess corkage wasn't really free after all.

When we asked what the tasting menu consisted of, he rushed through the seven items way too quickly and basically kept iterating how it was a great value -- great to know it's a good value, but was more curious to know what the actual courses would be and a delicious meal, not to score a good deal. It was also confusing because he didn't reference specific courses, and instead gave generic course names like \"pork\" and \"steak\" -- normally that would have been ok, but there were two pork dishes on the menu. He mentioned it last -- after a steak entree -- so I assumed it would be a main course pork we would be getting instead of the appetizer that consisted of pork belly that it actually referred to. Not a big deal, but not the service you would hope for from a place like Third Cousin. \n\nSecond, the food:\n\n- Hamachi crudo -- a wonderful start! Fresh, well complemented, and was a great palette cleanser\n- Uni creme brulee -- the much-referred to crowning jewel of Third Cousin. A wonderful mix of textures and balanced flavors -- up there with Skool's uni-flan. \n- Grilled octopus -- octopus was over-grilled, resulting in charred octopus tastes and extra-rubbery meat. Aioli was also overpowering.\n- Pork belly + scallop -- (thought this would be a pork chop, given the lack of information from our server).

It was on my list of cool new restaurants to visit that month so I was psyched and ready to stuff myself. The restaurant is in an area where we drove through some pretty narrow streets. (Think streets where one car is able to drive down the street. Yep, that narrow.) The parking situation is pretty much street parking. \n\nUpon walking into the place, I noticed that it seems like a little hole in the wall but done in a very clean and modern way. I loved the large roundish window by the front entrance. There's about 15 small tables with some pushed together to accommodate larger groups. There's also 2 seats at the bar area. We glanced over the menu and noticed it's shared plates, family style. We opted to go a l\u00e0 carte instead of their tasting menu because we weren't interested in some of the dishes. Everything we ordered was to our liking and I feel that this is definitely a restaurant that I could bring friends to for a small group dinner. The pricing isn't too steep either. \n\nPain Bakery Porridge Bread & House Butter : This was complimentary if asked for. I couldn't tell the taste between regular bread and porridge bread, but it was good nonetheless. \n\nCaramelized Brussel Sprouts : These were a good veggie side. Really can't go wrong with Brussel Sprouts. \n\nHamachi Crudo : This was nice. Delicately made and plated.

I do wish there was more. \n\nPappardelle : This was on the menu so I had to order it. (Pappardelle and Tagliatelle are my favorites.) This was really creamy and rich; richer than I'm used to. It was ok, but I would probably order something else next time. \n\nMeyer Lemon Pot De Cr\u00e8me : This filled up half the glass jar so it didn't seem like a lot, but when it was just enough as a dessert.

When we asked what the tasting menu consisted of, he rushed through the seven items way too quickly and basically kept iterating how it was a great value -- great to know it's a good value, but was more curious to know what the actual courses would be and a delicious meal, not to score a good deal. It was also confusing because he didn't reference specific courses, and instead gave generic course names like \"pork\" and \"steak\" -- normally that would have been ok, but there were two pork dishes on the menu. He mentioned it last -- after a steak entree -- so I assumed it would be a main course pork we would be getting instead of the appetizer that consisted of pork belly that it actually referred to. Not a big deal, but not the service you would hope for from a place like Third Cousin. \n\nSecond, the food:\n\n- Hamachi crudo -- a wonderful start! Fresh, well complemented, and was a great palette cleanser\n- Uni creme brulee -- the much-referred to crowning jewel of Third Cousin. A wonderful mix of textures and balanced flavors -- up there with Skool's uni-flan. \n- Grilled octopus -- octopus was over-grilled, resulting in charred octopus tastes and extra-rubbery meat. Aioli was also overpowering.\n- Pork belly + scallop -- (thought this would be a pork chop, given the lack of information from our server). The least impressive course -- pork belly was overcooked and burnt, and while the scallop was cooked really well, the spicy peanut sauce made the flavors confusing and tried too hard to be fusion.\n- Truffled ravioli / pappardelle -- fresh pasta always adds so much and both these were solid courses, but nothing to write home about. Preferred the ravioli to the pappardelle.\n- Flank steak with polenta and veggies -- solid course but again, nothing particularly standout. \n- Chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart -- again a little bit of a surprise given the lack of information from our server. Was expecting a pure chocolate souffle and ended up with a tart -- which was delicious, just unexpected. \n\nWould I come back again? Maybe -- if I'm in the area.

It took a few turns around the block to find a spot to park, but if you go right around 6:00, during the \"changing of the guard\", it's definitely doable.\n\nIt's a tiny little place, but better than expected acoustics, based on the previous reviews.

The list of wines they pour by the glass is pretty limited, but we managed to find a couple of reds that would go with the mix we were having, both pinot noirs.\n\nWe started by sharing Zuckerman's Asparagus Fries with vadouvan-garlic dip $9.00: 4.5 stars.  This was excellent.  The asparagus could have been slightly thinner, although their girth meant that they kept their texture.  The dip was exquisite, garlicky, a little acid, slightly floral, and smoky.\n\nThen of course with my fish egg obsession I had to get the signature Uni Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e petrossian caviar, yuzu tobiko, trout roe, toast, $21: 3.5 stars.  I'm sorry, but it just didn't thrill me.  I loved all the roe, fresh  sweet, briny, excellent popping action. The Cr\u00e8me was not bruleed though, and the custard itself wasn't firm enough for my tastes.  More like the texture of clotted cream.  \n\nBurrata warm blistered padron peppers, brook cherry, pickled cipollini, olives $15, 5.  Seemed like kind of kitchen sink combination, but it totally worked.  Each element held up to the others and the burrata was a perfect texture for the substrate it all rested on.\n\nDuck breast over kung pao vegetables, 4.5.

The duck was slightly under for me, but the I loved the unexpected heat level on the veg.\n\nSeared Sonoma Foie Gras walnut french toast, onion-blood orange jam, huckleberries $27, 4:  The foie was a bit on the small side, but fresh delicious and well prepared, however the combo of the french toast, the jam and the huckleberries accompanying it was overwhelmingly sweet.  I like a sweet contrast, but this took over, and made it seem more like a dessert.\n\nWe shared a meyer lemon pots de creme, 3:  This was just way too sweet for me, but good texture.

I have a feeling as people know more about this place, it will be harder to get reservations.\n\nMake sure you ask for their bread (thank to yelpers)-I am not a big fan of bread in the beginning because I don't want to get too full, but this bread was really good. \n\nsweet corn, kale & ricotta fritters- smoked gypsy pepper, sofrito-3 big frittters. Love the corn, but the sauce was nothing wow for me\n\ncrudo of hamachi- avocado, green strawberry, strawbenero sauce, furikake tuile, black garlic-refreshing. Good texture and the hamachi was very fresh\n\nsea scallop & pork belly- cucumber, mission fig, peanut, black vinegar, tarragon-perfection! scallops were amazing and the pork belly wasn't too fatty and it was crispy\n\nuni cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e- petrossian caviar, yuzu tobikko, trout roe, toast-this is their signature dish. I don't like uni, but I had to order it for my friend. It was really good. With everything mixed in, it was too strong of the sea uni taste I don't like. Very smooth. This is really small, but filling.\n\npappardelle- broccoli, wild mushroom, smoked mozz, creme fraiche, reggiano, truffle-the pasta is so simple, but another one of my favorites. Pasta was perfect al dente and you can taste the truffle\n \nduck breast & duck brat- pok choy, sugar snap peas, Japanese raspberry bbq-so full by the time we got this. This was good, but out of all the dishes this was my least favorite. A little too undercook for my liking, but it was tender and the flavors went well together. \n\nI'll be back!!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-09"}], "duo of wagyu ribeye and short rib": [], "almond crusted pork chop": [], "fried brussel sprouts": [], "maple  pear balsamic": [], "toasted pumkin seeds": []}
