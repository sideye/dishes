This review is based on my latest and perhaps only dine-in experience\n\nThis store is the perfect example that once a store has become popular and famous, they can basically do anything and the people would still continue to line up.  My wife and I were craving for some roasted ducks, so we decided to dine in and ordered wonton soup and roasted duck.  the waitress told us that it's going to be a FIFTEEN minutes wait.  Then she explained that they only do their wontons in batches, I guess to save their time and pots, but whatever, we ordered beef brisket and BBQ pork noodles instead..  \n\nIt was a long wait for a simple basic order (the line is long, but that's only for the outside to go food... but whatever).  I noticed another dine-in customer is complaining, and the waitress was saying something like they'll only do something if there are two or more orders, and the customer finally said \"fine I'll have two orders\", and then the waitress said, \"but we can't we do it now because we are too busy\"... the customer was like forget it.\n\nfinally, our orders have come.  I was thinking since it was a long wait and such a famous place, and cost $7.50 each, the quality has to be good.  Well, the duck is good, but both of the noodles tasted like crap. there's not much difference between the broth and the tea.  the pieces of beef briskets are WHITE and some are even COLD as if they just chopped some right from their freezer and dumped in the soup and served to us immediately.  the waitress did give us some \"roast duck sauce\" to dip the beef briskets in... BBQ pork is Ooookay, but we only got the skinny dry parts, I guess these are the unwanted parts they throw in noodle soup as they wanna save the juicy crispy parts for to go orders.   Anyway, I've had MUCH better  noodles for cheaper (even ABC, or the other Chinese BBQ place two blocks down the road with no customers) at cheaper price... heck, I could have made better noodle soup myself and faster.\n\nsafe to say, we would not consider dining in ever again, to go only...  and even then, it's getting more tempting to just go to the other place and skip the line.  the duck there isn't that bad either.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-01-17"}], "house special won ton": [], "roast duck won ton": [], "beef stew won ton noodles": [], "shredded duck preserved vegetable rice noodles": [], "roast duck w rice spaghetti": [], "mandarin bean sauce lo mein": [], "won ton  dumpling lo mein": [], "bbq pork lo mein": [], "two items of bbq lo mein": [], "shredded pork chow mein": [], "bbq pork chow mein": [], "fried noodles wsoy sauce": [], "mixed vegetables chow mein": [], "three shredded meat chow mein": [], "mongolian beef chow fun": [], "beef wtender green chow fun": [], "beef wscramble egg chow fun": [], "beef wblack bean sauce chow fun": [], "prawns wscramble egg chow fun": [], "prawns wtender green chow fun": [], "beef wchinese broccoli chow fun": [], "pan fried rice noodles wpork": [], "three shredded meat fried rice noodles": [], "beef stew wtender green chow fun": [], "bitter melon wbeef chow fun": [], "bitter melon wprawns chow mein": [], "spicy chow fun": [], "pan fried rice noodles wshredded roast duck": [], "country style fried rice noodles": [], "three shredded meat chow rice spaghetti": [], "seafood chow rice spaghetti": [], "shredded roast duck chow rice spaghetti": [], "chicken wpineapple fried rice": [], "chicken wsalty fish fried rice": [], "bbq pork fried rice": [{"excerpts": ["Having only gone twice, I've only tried a few things - the BBQ Pork fried rice is yummy and the Won Ton Soup (that my kid ordered) had a delicious clean broth.

It's a story of a young ugly duckling who was constantly bullied by her friends because of her appearance. But as we know, the duckling eventually blossomed into a beautiful Swan, admired and revered by all.\n\nBut you never heard the epilogue.\n\nWith beauty, fame, and power by her side, the Swan vengefully sought for all the ducks who had bullied her. Swan roasted each duck until their skin were crisp to the touch, and then she would send them off into a place known as Cheung Hing. To this day, it is said that one could walk by Noriega and 30th and still smell the roasted skin of the duck bullies....\n\nAs a Yelper investigator, I had to check out the legendary Cheung Hing myself.

Hey what are you doing here anyway?\"\n\n\"The same reason why you are here.\" She pointed to her plate of Roast Duck Over Rice.\n\nIn my rush to meet Padme, I had forgotten to admire the beauty of my plate. The glaze of the crispy skin reflected the bright lights of Cheung Hing. The oils and fat, full of flavor, were leaking from the duck and into the crevices between each grain of soft and fluffy rice. It looked spectacular, and smelled even better. \n\nIt must have tasted even better than that because Padme was attacking her plate with ferocity. She licked the juice off her fingers after sinking her teeth into the tender meats from the duck leg. The duck was delicious, yes. But it was still very uncharacteristic of her to savagely devour the duck in that violent manner. \n\n\"Hey Padme, maybe you should slow down. I know it's delicious and all, but you're still a Hollywood actress and there are paparazzi everywhere.\"\n\nWith half of her face still buried in the plate, her eyes rose to stare into my own. Her eyes were beginning to turn red, and her pupils dilated into utter blackness.\n\n\"You keep calling me Padme...\" she hissed.\n\n\"I...I'm sorry, would...would you prefer Qu-Queen Amidala?\"\n\n\"Can't you see...?\"\n\nShe stood. Black feathers sprouted from her sides. She fluttered her arms fluidly and cocked her head.

I felt like having duck for lunch one Sunday morning so I joined the queue and the guy in front of me bought the last two ducks; 12:15 PM and they're already sold out of duck!  \n\nThere wasn't a menu in sight but the deli meats were listed overhead (duck feet, duck wings, duck tongues, chicken, BBQ pork, pork ears, pork stomach) and I asked for roast pork over rice.  What a fabulous, simple meal.  The roast pork is lean and flavorful and the skin is extremely crispy and tastes of five spice powder.  There is a thick layer of fat between the meat and the skin though, but it needs to be there to keep the meat moist while making the skin extra crispy.  They provide plenty of white rice to soak up the flavors along with mildly crunchy boiled cabbage, under $7.  \n\nOkay, I bought the roast pork again and received much fattier pieces.  I definitely recommend getting the meat over rice to offset the saltiness and soak up the juices.  \n\nAfter I ordered, I saw the menu was taped up and they also have copies for the people who dine in.  There are a few tables on the side and a fairly long menu that includes congee (I have to try the congee).  The service is brusque and efficient.  But it's still confusing unless you understand Cantonese.  Cash only.\n\nMarch 2008 update:  I was ready to award another star if their congee impressed me.  It's staying at four stars because the congee is good but watery.  I had the roast duck congee.  They add chopped roast duck at the very end.  The congee was lukewarm and I had to expend much effort separating the meat from the bones.  When I eat congee, I don't even want to chew - it needs to be as easy as possible because it's comfort food.  They should add more ginger and scallions too.  On the positive side, they give you lots of duck and the duck is extremely flavorful.  For 50 cents you can add preserved egg to any congee and they use good preserved eggs.  \n\nThe dine-in menu is actually pretty lengthy and includes rice plates, won ton soup, noodle soups, braised noodles, fried rice, chow fun, BBQ rice plates, and seafood, chicken and pork, veggie dishes.

So, I dropped my groceries and walked on over.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you upon this place is the poultry hanging in the window. The roast duck and chicken looks phenomenal. This is definitely an eye catcher to those passing by on the street or sidewalk. I saw ribs as well and knew I had to get something from here. \n\nOnce inside I noticed that the seating was very LIMITED. Actually, there are signs posted to just take a seat at a table if you want to dine in. Also, the seats are reserved for those that want to dine in as well. The signs come off as a bit aggressive which was a somewhat of a turn off. When you walked in you see the menu to your right on the wall. I thought initially that they only offered to poultry by the pound but I did see a menu at the end of the counter. Fortunately, I knew I wanted BBQ ribs and that was my aim in coming here. After placing my order I was considering buying more food but that seemed to be a bit much for just me, I like to eat but this would've been excessive.\n\nWhen I finally placed my order the butcher began to chop up the BBQ ribs. He was rather aggressive and excited while he was chopping. I don't know if that is how most butchers are but he was really into it. The cost for the pound came out to $8.70 total. All things considered that was a bargain in my opinion.\n\nWhile I placed my order the female cashier and someone in the back were yelling back and forth to each other. It was a bit odd and confusing. I could tell by her face that it was not something good. Because I could not understand what was being said I just waiting to get my food rung up. But, when I finally got ready to pay she seemed upset and frustrated. I just got some bad vibes from here. Not very welcoming or inviting. Oh, I forgot to mention that out of the maybe 5 or 6 tables here there was only one table that was occupied and that was by the staff who happened to be taking a break. My guess is that eating here is not the best option.\n\nAfter paying for my food I grabbed a menu and headed out. \n\nWhen I finally got home I had a chance to review the menu. There are some really good options for food here but I am not sure that I would want to come back to such a unstable environment.

I did feel that the ribs were cut into pieces way too small but the flavor was still good. I was able to save some for tomorrow because the pound was actually more than what I needed. Good ribs and a good meal. \n\nIf the workers here could get along and customer service improved I could see this place getting a lot of good reviews. \n\nI am satisfied with what I ordered but I hope that next time I come here things have improved for the better. \n\n#bbqribsIgotdibs", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-16"}], "chicken with duck liver": [], "five spicy chicken": [], "bbq pork": [{"excerpts": ["You can't go wrong with either the roast duck or BBQ pork (assuming they haven't run out of either....).  \n\n"], "author": "Claire S.", "review": "So here's the deal...\n\n1.

If you closed your eyes and couldn't smell, you can definitely taste that it was pork. It was chewy, a bit tender, not too salty, and the outside bbq sauce was what made it good.

There was always a line out the door during meal times. Since the place is tiny, having a line form wasn't hard to achieve. It only takes 3 or 4 customers to look busy.\n\nSo on my trip back to SF for business, I am again staying in the Sunset. Trying to capture some memories, I dropped by Cheng Hing to grab a quick bite. Inside, there's a counter with pre-cooked dishes, from diced chicken with peppers, to fish, fried tofu...etc. Hanging by the window in true Cantonese fashion are whole golden, glistening roasted ducks and slabe of BBQ pork. There are also a few tables for customers who don't mind eating next to a line of shouting customers ordering take-out. \n\nAs I recalled (and read on Yelp) they are known for their duck, and I had to have it again. I also chose a 2nd item, fish filet in black bean sauce over rice. I was never a fan of Cantonese BBQ pork (char siu) so I passed as much as they tried to convince me how good it is. \n\nThe two items rest on a pile of rice with a few pieces of cabbage, which I suspect was to fill the box and make it appear fuller than it really is. The fish in b.b. sauce was decent. It's salty, tender (as fish should be) but lacked anything exciting. It's a \"filler\" The duck pieces were extremely fatty. I'd say 50% of the pieces they threw into the box was not edible, unless you actually enjoy chunks of oily, fatty, greasy duck lard covered by an equally fatty skin. The pieces that actually had meat was good, but the flavor was often covered by the taste of grease. \n\nAfter eating half of the order, I began to feel.... not right. That was my cue to stop. Perhaps it was the heavy amount of grease that stealthily leaked into the rice but I felt weighed down and had an urge to drink hot tea to rinse out the grease from my intestines. \n\nThinking back, the duck I ordered years ago were much leaner and didn't make me feel sick in my stomach (sorry belly, I'll make it up to you with some 'good' food) Now that I relived my memories, I no longer want to go back. \n\nFor 2 items and a plastic bag (I assume they charged me for the bag, since they spilled sauce on the box and I really didn't want duck grease on my leather seats) it was $8.60. Hardly a bargain, and definitely not worth the price. I now have the urge to detox. \n\nAs for the people lining up, perhaps the Cantonese elders have grown immune to this level of cardiac causing oil. Not me. I can find many other tastier ways to clog my arteries.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-03-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Buyer beware  - visited this BBQ pork, roast duck place because of good reviews on Yelp.

I will definitely come back.\n\nWe sat down and one of the ladies promptly gave us hot tea...we had to grab the menu ourselves which I didn't really mind.\n\nI got the BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken. Now...I LOVE LOVE LOVE BBQ pork. Biggest fan of BBQ pork right here. Whenever my family went out to eat, they ALWAYS asked me \"so, what do you want? BBQ pork again?\" So I would say I know what GOOD BBQ pork tastes like. But, this wasn't that good. Definitely other places that are a lot better. The soy sauce chicken, on the other hand, was pretty damn tasty. A lot of meat. Yummm. Not that much sauce on the chicken itself...more on the rice haha. Some veggies on the side and a good amount of rice. The portion of our rice dishes was perfect. \n\nFunny story: There is always people lining up for this place (it was 4pm and it wasn't never empty...). Well, this one guy skipped all of them and ordered his food. The other see lais (lol if you're chinese you know who I'm talking about! hahaa) were GLARING at him. Hilarious.\n\nScary story: There was a little girl with her mom and she kept on singing but it was creepy...like those little kids in scary movies. lol. Please learn some Disney songs :/\n\nI think I would come back again. Although the BBQ pork wasn't the most amazing, I think I want to try their other foods.

What a fabulous, simple meal.  The roast pork is lean and flavorful and the skin is extremely crispy and tastes of five spice powder.  There is a thick layer of fat between the meat and the skin though, but it needs to be there to keep the meat moist while making the skin extra crispy.  They provide plenty of white rice to soak up the flavors along with mildly crunchy boiled cabbage, under $7.  \n\nOkay, I bought the roast pork again and received much fattier pieces.  I definitely recommend getting the meat over rice to offset the saltiness and soak up the juices.  \n\nAfter I ordered, I saw the menu was taped up and they also have copies for the people who dine in.  There are a few tables on the side and a fairly long menu that includes congee (I have to try the congee).  The service is brusque and efficient.  But it's still confusing unless you understand Cantonese.  Cash only.\n\nMarch 2008 update:  I was ready to award another star if their congee impressed me.  It's staying at four stars because the congee is good but watery.  I had the roast duck congee.  They add chopped roast duck at the very end.  The congee was lukewarm and I had to expend much effort separating the meat from the bones.  When I eat congee, I don't even want to chew - it needs to be as easy as possible because it's comfort food.  They should add more ginger and scallions too.  On the positive side, they give you lots of duck and the duck is extremely flavorful.  For 50 cents you can add preserved egg to any congee and they use good preserved eggs.  \n\nThe dine-in menu is actually pretty lengthy and includes rice plates, won ton soup, noodle soups, braised noodles, fried rice, chow fun, BBQ rice plates, and seafood, chicken and pork, veggie dishes.

"], "author": "Robert F.", "review": "I had to go to Safeway across the street from Cheung Hing and was craving BBQ after shopping. So, I dropped my groceries and walked on over.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you upon this place is the poultry hanging in the window. The roast duck and chicken looks phenomenal. This is definitely an eye catcher to those passing by on the street or sidewalk. I saw ribs as well and knew I had to get something from here. \n\nOnce inside I noticed that the seating was very LIMITED. Actually, there are signs posted to just take a seat at a table if you want to dine in. Also, the seats are reserved for those that want to dine in as well. The signs come off as a bit aggressive which was a somewhat of a turn off. When you walked in you see the menu to your right on the wall. I thought initially that they only offered to poultry by the pound but I did see a menu at the end of the counter. Fortunately, I knew I wanted BBQ ribs and that was my aim in coming here. After placing my order I was considering buying more food but that seemed to be a bit much for just me, I like to eat but this would've been excessive.\n\nWhen I finally placed my order the butcher began to chop up the BBQ ribs. He was rather aggressive and excited while he was chopping. I don't know if that is how most butchers are but he was really into it. The cost for the pound came out to $8.70 total. All things considered that was a bargain in my opinion.\n\nWhile I placed my order the female cashier and someone in the back were yelling back and forth to each other. It was a bit odd and confusing. I could tell by her face that it was not something good. Because I could not understand what was being said I just waiting to get my food rung up. But, when I finally got ready to pay she seemed upset and frustrated. I just got some bad vibes from here. Not very welcoming or inviting. Oh, I forgot to mention that out of the maybe 5 or 6 tables here there was only one table that was occupied and that was by the staff who happened to be taking a break. My guess is that eating here is not the best option.\n\nAfter paying for my food I grabbed a menu and headed out. \n\nWhen I finally got home I had a chance to review the menu. There are some really good options for food here but I am not sure that I would want to come back to such a unstable environment. I would like to try the running chicken with rice but we'll have to see.\n\nAs far as my food goes, it was OK. Good sweet ribs that I mixed with some steamed rice. I did feel that the ribs were cut into pieces way too small but the flavor was still good. I was able to save some for tomorrow because the pound was actually more than what I needed. Good ribs and a good meal. \n\nIf the workers here could get along and customer service improved I could see this place getting a lot of good reviews. \n\nI am satisfied with what I ordered but I hope that next time I come here things have improved for the better. \n\n#bbqribsIgotdibs", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Got there at 6:30, ordered, then told no chow fun, no bbq ribs.\n", "4.

Don't be intimidated by the line out the door since it's a small primarily takeout place and they're pretty efficient so the line moves rather quick. I actually prefer the long lines because the meat is not left sitting for too long since they're always cooking up the next batch of bbq meat. \n\nBe prepared to order or you'll be holding up the line. I usually get the roast duck ($11/half or $18/whole) and bbq pork ($8.25/lb). There's also roast pork, chicken (five spice, soy sauce, free range, soy sauce), cuttle fish, pork ear/tongue/stomach, chicken feet, as well as cooked dishes. Both the roast duck and bbq pork were really good. Apart from the good seasoning/flavors, the duck isn't too fatty and the bbq pork isn't too lean.
