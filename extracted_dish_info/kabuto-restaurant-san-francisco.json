He has sold the business to Jinsoo Kim and Eric Cho, who own Ariake Japanese Restaurant, just a block away at 5041 Geary Blvd. (at 14th Avenue). Until Aug. 31, Kojima will be training Kim's and Cho's chefs in his style.\r\nLast year Kojima gave up his lease at his popular Japanese restaurant and moved it across the street to a smaller space. The idea was to downscale and operate the new place with his wife and children. Now Kojima plans to move about five hours north of San Francisco, near Mount Shasta. He said his wife, Ayako, who has cancer, needs to drink pure water, and that that area has it in abundance.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, travelers came to the region to \"take the waters\" from the many springs. Kojima plans to open a small sushi bar there. Kim, one of Kabuto's new owners, is an experienced sushi chef, having worked for seven years at Ebisu in the Sunset. He also has cooked French and Japanese cuisine for many years. He says the partners plan to close the restaurant for just a short time, reopening in early September and keeping Kojima's style.\r\n\r\nDinner will be served nightly except Sunday; lunch might be added later. Currently, Kabuto is open for lunch and dinner Thursday through Tuesday.\" I managed to eat at Kabuto on Aug. 31, 2005. :) Had to wait about an hour and a half though.

We were reviewing their special sushi menu along with their regular menu.  It took a long time.  I found out later that Kabuto has a link on Menupages.com, and some homework ahead of time can help.\n\nI ordered their Nigiri Ichinin-Mae, their sushi assortment.  It comes with tuna, albacore, shrimp, mackerel, halibut, salmon, hokkigai, smelt roe & tekka maki.  There was even a giant clam nigiri, the first I've seen.  All of it was delicious.

Next comes a saba nigiri and a dragon roll.  The mackerel is delicious and always garners respect from the sushi chef/waitstaff anywhere we go.  Just an observation.  The dragon roll was pretty good, as the unagi and avocado were delicious, but there was a bit too much rice and the tempura shrimp seemed small.\n\nBut the highlight for us was off the special sushi menu -- the Katsunagi.  This is unagi, avocado and shiso deep fried as katsu (coated with bread crumbs & fried) and served with kabuto raspberry miso sauce.  The sauce looked like \"country gravy\" which seemed odd at first.  But combined with the katsu it became a nice flavorful dish.  Awesome!\n\nWe tried our luck at dessert, but ended up underwhelmed.  We each had the tempura green tea ice cream and the macha creme brulee.  Both could have been sweeter in taste.  They are probably trying out new ideas for execution and presentation of desserts.

Again it was a slight interpretation as the salmon on top was seared with a blow torch and garnished with some creamy sauce that went very very well with the fish.

When it comes to sushi in San Francisco, I'm often quite conflicted.  I've not really had my best sushi experiences here in SF.  The ones that I have enjoyed have cost an arm AND a leg (or promise of my firstborn child...go ask my mom, those restaurants shouldn't be holding their breath for repayment on that one...). \n\nSo, what did I think of Kabuto?\n\nVery good, solid, high quality sushi.  I appreciated the CLEANLINESS of the flavors.  This is NOT a place that will WAOW you with modern ambiance or crazy inventive rolls.  Yet, it is also NOT overly stuffy or overly traditional.  There are some innovative and interesting rolls to try here, so those that feel the need to experiment have room to play.\n\nI categorize this as = MODERATELY priced (although, I did not pay the bill that night), solid sushi.  I read here that it is sushi for the gai-jin...well...as long as it is fresh and tasty, why not? ;-)\n\nI find the service ABRUPT BORDERING ON BRUSQUE.  (I would give the service only 3 stars), BUT, with that typed, this was my first visit and I've seen a LOT worse at other restaurants.  Perhaps the FLURRY of the servers has more to do with LIMITED SEATING?  At times, I felt that the service was RUSHED.  Just my opinion.\n\nThe experience started off with the traditional warm hand-towels for prep, which I LOVE.\n\nFor a table of FOUR, we ordered quite a bit.  I cannot recall EVERYTHING in detail  (and as I said, I did not pay, so I do not have the receipt), yet, I will try to describe some of the more memorable dishes:\n\nHamachi Pear  ( hamachi nigiri topped with a slice of pair and dijon mustard). Very petite, bite sized portion with very fresh fish.  Not quite my favorite, but the fish was very fresh.  I'm not so sure if I really cared for the pear and dijon mixed with this choice of fish.\n\n\nCeViChe  Very interesting presentation with halibut and salsa wrapped with deep fried seaweed and served with lime\nand sea salt.  There is NOT your traditional presentation of Ceviche.  I liked the flavor of the ceviche itself, but the oily seaweed detracted from the experience.\n\nFoie Gras Sushi   This seared, marinated goose liver served\nwith balsamic raspberry and sauce was actually one of my favorite.  It was an interesting combination that played  well with TEXTURE, FLAVOR and CONCEPT for sushi.\n\nGomae  how can you go wrong with SPINACH and sesame soy dressing *LOL*...\n\nI think that we got the hirame...something... *LOL*...It was really good.\n\nThe seaweed salad VERY disappointing.  More of salad than traditional wakame salad...\n\nHmmm...we also got 2 orders of chirashi sushi (mixture of several different sashimi)...very fresh and good.\n\nOh...and dessert...the green tea mochi ice-cream was eh...  the green tea cheesecake = very good.\n\nAll in all -- food = good experience...service= fair\n\nparking= hard to find (had to walk quite a ways)", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-10-04"}], "ogura cream": [{"excerpts": ["Things I liked: the tofu miso soup, the pira-kara nasu, the chawan mushi, the fried baby octopus, the sea escargot, the uni sushi, and the ogura cream anmitsu (not often seen outside Japan in the US).

Who can resist that artery clogging goodness?!?!?! Not me...\n\nLast Tuesday was my most recent visit, and my gf and I ordered the following:\n\n*Foie Gras Sushi (MUST ORDER): The BEST tasting bite EVER! The foie gras is perfectly seared and served Nigiri style. As soon as you sink your teeth into the foie gras, it melts into your mouth like butter. MmMmm, the accompanying balsamic raspberry sauce adds a great tanginess to the foie gras to balance out the richness. \n\n*Sunrise (MUST ORDER): Two thick slices of Sake wrapped around a quail egg. The sake itself is already buttery, but the quail egg adds an additional layer of creamy goodness. *drool*\n\n*1849 Oysters (MUST ORDER): 2 Oysters on a half shell topped w/ quail egg, uni, salmon roe, ponzu sauce, and gold paper. Oh My!!!! All the ingredients were super FRESH. It's one of those things that you have to try for yourself because it's too hard to put into words how MIND BLOWING it is. Rich, creamy, buttery, salty, sweet, tangy...\n\n*Hamachi Pear Nigiri: A generous slice of hamachi (very fresh) topped with sliced pear and a fruity mustard sauce. Very interesting flavor combos, but it all works in harmony giving you a tangy, savory, and sweet flavor.\n\n*Ceviche: Chopped halibut and salsa on top of fried seaweed. The halibut was fresh and the fried seaweed was very crispy and held up well to the ceviche. The saltiness from the seaweed gave the halibut enough flavor that there was no need for any soy sauce. \n\n*Dragon Roll: This was more of a filler than anything. There was nothing special about it. Do note that Kabuto's rolls are half the size of other restaurant's rolls although they charge the price of a whole roll. So, I would veer away from ordering rolls here. \n\n*Spicy Hamachi: Another filler...the spiciness came from the roll topped with Sriracha. I would have rather had it blended into the fish. \n\n*Tempura Ice Cream: Crispy, warm, rich, sweet but not too sweet; everything that a dessert should be. The vanilla ice cream was tempura battered and came out warm. The tempura was light and crispy, but the ice cream was still very hard. Despite this, it was a great ending to a good meal.\n\n*Anmitsu: Gelatin with fruit cocktail, green tea ice cream and sweet red bean paste. I could have passed on this. There were too many things going on and the ingredients didn't work well together. The fruit cocktail syrup + green tea ice cream + red bean paste made for sugar overload.\n\n*Ginjo-shu sake: Filtered and slightly sweet. After 5 shots = BUZZED!\n\nSERVICE: The only reason why Kabuto is not deserving of 5 stars is their service. The times I've been there, the waitresses were not attentive and you always have to wave your arms in their air to get their attention. Despite that it's always packed, the food does come in decent timing; about 15 minutes for the first dish, and then another 5 min for accompanying orders.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: Simple; wooden table and chairs. It's a SMALL restaurant; with max seating at around 30. So, if you're coming on the weekends, make sure to make reservations; otherwise, expect a wait. \n\nOverall, Kabuto is a great place to try creative and flavorful sushi combinations. Stick with the menu specials and the special sushi and AVOID their rolls b/c they're blah and not worth the price.

Definitely worth trying at least once.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the size of the shiro maguro and sake nigiri, and there was too much wasabi gluing the fish to the rice, but the fish was fresh.  The negi hamachi and negi shiro maguro rolls were okay; size was as expected; didn't expect to taste wasabi in the rolls though (dislike).  I don't use wasabi at all when I eat sushi because the flavor is distasteful to me.  I don't like using soy sauce with sushi either, not because the flavor is distasteful; com'on, I'm Asian, so I love soy sauce!  I just want to be able to taste the subtleties of the fish when I eat sushi, and soy sauce/wasabi crush those subtleties.\n\nDessert was okay.  I had the anmitsu, and there were still chunks of ice in the green tea ice cream.  The sweet red bean paste was yummy, but the little fruit bits were drowning in the thin liquid at the bottom - some type of sauce that was unnecessary and abundant.\n\nI was one of 3 parties in the restaurant, so there were about 4 waitresses I could call on at any time.  They were all friendly and attentive.
