There was a plethora of pickled Chinese vegetables used but Yelp does not support Chinese characters so I cannot list them one by one. Most dishes were prepared well but definitely not worth the $45 per head price.  If we didn't ask for steamed rice, I'd still be starving. I also pre-load with 4 pieces of grilled cheese since I read about the portion sizes in advance.\n\nOur party had 6 so the total ended up $310+. With that kind of money, if we went to R&G or South Sea Seafood Village, we'd be eating Geoduck sashimi, steamed whole fish (that was swimming in the tank 10 minutes ago), steamed oysters with black bean sauce, smoked sea bass, probably a mound of fresh shrimp, whole crab (possibly 2), and free steamed rice.\n\nI grew up in Hong Kong. I kid you not, Hong Kong has pretty decent Shanghai restaurants because of the flood of immigrants from Shanghai after the Nationalist party had been kicked out of China by the Communists. The dishes served at Jai Yun are NOT worth raving about. They are decent, not spectacular. Saying that they are overpriced is an understatement.\n\nPickled vegetables, tofu products, and Chinese wheat gluten are in abundance every single fracking day in Chinatown. They're not what the chef find super fresh and unique for the day. You want duck tongues? they're $3 a pound a block away. You want beef tripe? New Asia has them for dimsum and they're less than $3 a dish. You want pickled cucumber with sesame oil? Give me $10 I can drown you with  a whole bottle of sesame oil and 8 huge cucumbers.\n\nDiet coke served was expired back in 2007.

To the Chinese, formal dining is something to be celebrated and holds a very fond place in most people's hearts. However, restaurants--even the very best traditional-style ones--are not high on trendy modern furnishing nor the sort of graceful finery you'd find, say, at Paris' Taillevent. Often as not, the grand old banquet restaurants in China are a bit worn around the edges with what appear to have been an effort towards poshness . . . but circa 1983. Jai Yun is cut from the same cloth: the emphasis is purely on the food though I expect were you to ask the chef he'd think the atmosphere and furnishings are just fine. For many Americans though, if you're paying $100 for dinner you probably expect a setting that doesn't look like every other run-down Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Jai Yun, alas, just isn't in agreement with you on that.\n\nSo, if you're seeking a more \"American\" fine dining experience with on-point service and lush surroundings, seek that elsewhere. This is a Chinese banquet restaurant in one of the largest Chinatowns in North America serving traditional yet innovate Chinese food--take it as it is or go somewhere else, but don't complain to the tone of \"well, gosh, it sure wasn't much food for all that money and it wasn't how celebrity chef __________ did things at his Vegas restaurant Darlene and I went to a month ago!\". Because this restaurant isn't that restaurant. \n\nThe emphasis here is on Shanghai cuisine (Hu cuisine) which isn't nearly as easy to find in SF as Cantonese or other regional Chinese cuisines. There are, in the prix fixe dinner, a number of cold dishes and then hot ones. A lotus root salad, smoked fish, and various pickled vegetable dishes are stand-outs though everything is of the utmost quality. Anything done here with Chinese Five-Spice is also stellar and really shows what Five-Spice is supposed to taste like and how it's ideally used in cooking various meats. Likewise, the chef knows his way around applying ginger as a primary yet not overpowering seasoning. The Shanghainese-style Crystal Shrimp is probably my favorite but as the chef is custom preparing every dish himself and using ingredients he purchased the same day in many cases, the offerings can easily vary night by night.
