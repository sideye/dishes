This place is strikingly average for a breakfast place...\n\nMy Greek omelette featured tomatoes, feta cheese, and artichoke hearts. It was served with home fries and a side of toast. The plate was huge! The omelette was really good, perfect balance of creamy from the cheese and tang from the marinated artichoke hearts. However, my home fries were mushy/soggy...a real downer. I ended up taking this home as leftovers and refried them the next day...it was much better then.\n\nMy mom opted for the Monte Carlo. The French toast was soggy...possibly from the juice released from the ham? The cheese was also congealed by the time it came to the table. The jam that was brought over? It was in a container that definitely looked like it had it shared multiple times over, the spoon inside looked so gross - it was littered with toast crumbs. Mom opted to not use it, but said that having no jam on the Monte Carlo really ruined the experience. Her order came with a side of salad which came with wilted pieces of lettuce drowning in dressing. Sad.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't say that the food is bad...but it's not really worth it when I can produce the same quality at home.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-07-18"}], "hawaiian": [{"excerpts": ["Hawaiian burger with fries on the side.
