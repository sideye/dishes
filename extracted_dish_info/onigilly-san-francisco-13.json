Right across the street was Onigilly. I am a huge fan of gourmet rice balls, so I raced over to give this place a try.\n\nI must admit, I wasn't blown away by the menu. Nothing I haven't seen elsewhere, and definitely nothing innovative. These \"onigiri\" rice balls are shaped into a triangle. No, this does not qualify as \"sushi.\" Everything is made with brown rice. I'm not a fan of brown rice elsewhere, but here it's quite sweet and good. Definitely a fan of how they prepare the onigiri. Each one is made to order, so expect to wait for your food. Lots of vegan and gluten-free options, too.\n\nThe ordering system here is not fun. The little shop gets so crowded that the few seats available can't even be used. You'll likely become incredibly cramped and uncomfortable. There's no real line for ordering and picking up, so patrons just curve toward the inside of the shop and it's a struggle to walk in or out.\n\nI went with the Snow Crab for $3.45 -- simple, fresh, and with lemon aioli. Yes, this is real crab meat. For the price, it's a little high-end. In general, the rice balls will run you between $2.76 and $3.75, before taxes. However, I'd expect 2-3 to fill you up and that's not too bad for a nice lunch. I devoured my Snow Crab rice ball in seconds.\n\nHere are some other options:\n- Teriyaki Tofu\n- Renkon (Spicy Lotus Root)\n- Shiitake\n- Spicy Bacon\n- Spicy Miso Beef\n- Unagi (Eel)\n- Grilled Salmon\n- Tempura Shrimp\n\nBesides the rice rolls, they offer salads and soup.

These \"onigiri\" rice balls are shaped into a triangle. No, this does not qualify as \"sushi.\" Everything is made with brown rice. I'm not a fan of brown rice elsewhere, but here it's quite sweet and good. Definitely a fan of how they prepare the onigiri. Each one is made to order, so expect to wait for your food. Lots of vegan and gluten-free options, too.\n\nThe ordering system here is not fun. The little shop gets so crowded that the few seats available can't even be used. You'll likely become incredibly cramped and uncomfortable. There's no real line for ordering and picking up, so patrons just curve toward the inside of the shop and it's a struggle to walk in or out.\n\nI went with the Snow Crab for $3.45 -- simple, fresh, and with lemon aioli. Yes, this is real crab meat. For the price, it's a little high-end. In general, the rice balls will run you between $2.76 and $3.75, before taxes. However, I'd expect 2-3 to fill you up and that's not too bad for a nice lunch.

They are prepared Chipotle-style in rote assembly fashion, and while the ingredients lent some interesting flavors, the execution not so much.\n\nThe rice balls at least were decent albeit unmemorable lunchtime fare, but the Tofu Noodle Soup was a rather drab concoction purportedly made of all-natural ingredients including the noodles made of \"tofu-yam\" whatever that is. The miso itself was too milky for my taste, and the only ingredients I enjoyed in the broth were the shiitake mushrooms and the seaweed (photo: http://bit.ly/1sJoQQ9). The whole experience always makes me miss my mom who was a true onigiri master with more traditional fillings usually involving daikon or natto (which they do offer here). But if you need a faux-fix, you can overlook the rolling r's and give at least the rice balls a try.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...rice balls Chipotle-style but avoid the noodle soup\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...not much to it, grab a table when you can\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...not as nice as you would think...oh, that's right, we're not in J-Town\nTOTAL - 3 stars...\"Rice balls!\", said the Queen, \"If I had them, I'd be King!\"", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-05-18"}, {"excerpts": ["This place also doesn't have the usual meats, but instead have spicy bacon, snow crab, and soboro.\n\n\n"], "author": "Jonathan B K.", "review": "A small lunch spot in the Chinatown area.

Nothing I haven't seen elsewhere, and definitely nothing innovative. These \"onigiri\" rice balls are shaped into a triangle. No, this does not qualify as \"sushi.\" Everything is made with brown rice. I'm not a fan of brown rice elsewhere, but here it's quite sweet and good. Definitely a fan of how they prepare the onigiri. Each one is made to order, so expect to wait for your food. Lots of vegan and gluten-free options, too.\n\nThe ordering system here is not fun. The little shop gets so crowded that the few seats available can't even be used. You'll likely become incredibly cramped and uncomfortable. There's no real line for ordering and picking up, so patrons just curve toward the inside of the shop and it's a struggle to walk in or out.\n\nI went with the Snow Crab for $3.45 -- simple, fresh, and with lemon aioli. Yes, this is real crab meat. For the price, it's a little high-end. In general, the rice balls will run you between $2.76 and $3.75, before taxes. However, I'd expect 2-3 to fill you up and that's not too bad for a nice lunch. I devoured my Snow Crab rice ball in seconds.\n\nHere are some other options:\n- Teriyaki Tofu\n- Renkon (Spicy Lotus Root)\n- Shiitake\n- Spicy Bacon\n- Spicy Miso Beef\n- Unagi (Eel)\n- Grilled Salmon\n- Tempura Shrimp\n\nBesides the rice rolls, they offer salads and soup.

The lunch line is long, but fast, and the employees are super friendly.\n\nThe way it works is you can order a set of 3 onigiri for $9 (there's also rice bowls, which I hear are delicious as well). There's a lot of options, but here are the onigiri I've tried:\n- spicy bacon: sounds weird, but it is actually quite delicious; note that this is definitely one of the greasier options\n- snow crab: a lighter taste of delicious fresh crabmeat; rounds out the greasiness of other options\n- salmon: probably the most \"traditional\" onigiri; tastes like fresh salmon and a bit of japanese mayo\n- unagi: if you love eel like I do, you'll love this one; tastes like an unagi nigiri at a great sushi place, but with more unagi!\n\nThe portions are decent (but not huge) and they aren't skimpy with the filling.

In the busiest of hour, in the diversity of downtown, it's not that hard to spot him. One might even notice him with xenophobic eyes, as the only white guy working the line. The white guy with glasses? More than that, he notices your confusion as you stare at the blackboard, every single order, his service unwavering and never falter. His mouth steadfast with suggestions, yet tone soft with resolution. His gestures animated, yet controlled like an artisan that mastered his craft. Keith Haring in the flesh. One might question the validity of being a cashier as an art form, as similarly stances have been taken in regards to performance art, rest assure he doesn't do it for the fame, the limelight, the pay, merely a person with character playing a character.  However trivial, there is no debate about the significant an extraordinary cashier brings to the table on a daily basis for a business. \n\nThere are four different Onigilly locations, he is the reason I frequent this one.

Unfortunately this place is very popular with the lunchtime crowd, and I got stuck in the middle of it.

I also ordered a green tea lemonade to drink while I waited, which was another 5 minutes or so. \n\nInside is quite small but it's okay because most people take their food to go. I liked how they served free mugicha (barley tea) and green tea to customers. While I waited for my food I drank some of my green tea lemonade, and I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. The first sip was far too sweet but it sort of grows on you after awhile. Even so I probably wouldn't order it again. As I watched them make the rice balls I noticed they weren't using the traditional method for onigiri: getting a ball of rice in one hand, placing the filling in the center and covering the filling with a bit more rice. Instead they had a triangle of pre-formed rice, stuck the filling on top, then added another triangle-shaped rice on top of that. Kind of like a rice sandwich? Weird. \n\nBut I guess the aforementioned technique allows you to stuff more filling inside which is good for the customer. The renkon (lotus root) was pretty good, not too salty, a bit spicy, and it had the right amount of crunch. The snow crab was light and delicate tasting, but there was too much mayo inside.

You'll likely become incredibly cramped and uncomfortable. There's no real line for ordering and picking up, so patrons just curve toward the inside of the shop and it's a struggle to walk in or out.\n\nI went with the Snow Crab for $3.45 -- simple, fresh, and with lemon aioli.

Terms of food, I should've stuck with their onigilly's or gotten a rice bowl. The cold food did not go too well with greens. The snow crab tasted a bit off, and the spicy shrimp was just okay. The only thing I liked was the spicy bacon. Some of the salad greens at the bottom of the bowl were bruised.... boo :(\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I decided to get the salad bowl with Spicy Shrimp, Unagi and Spicy Bacon while my boyfriend got the same combination but in a rice bowl...

An adequate healthy lunch for less than $10!\n\nAll of the meats we got were delicious! Super flavorful! I personally think I liked the unagi best while my bf said the shrimp was his favorite. You can't go wrong with any of them though. \n\nMy boyfriend was surprised that the rice was brown, said it tasted like white rice... which is a good thing for the picky rice eaters, healthy without compensating flavor (although I personally enjoy brown rice). \n\nThe miso soup was good too, not too strong or salty; I loved that it was completely natural so I know that I was getting some of my probiotic intake for the day :D \n\nThey have TONS of options for your onigiri/salad/rice bowls. If you're vegetarian or gluten free this is a great option for you guys too! If you're in a hurry onigiri is very friendly for on the go eating as well.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small/cramped and busy. We went at an odd time..around 1:30-2ish but there was a steady flow of customers coming in... if you're dining in you're gonna have to choose on whether or not you wanna stick your ass or frontal area in someones face since the tables are really close together =p \n\nBut that's not the point!

The perfect place to satisfy your Japanese/sushi cravings without the heaviness of a bento box. \n\nI came here the other day with my bestie. She tried the salad bowl with a choice of 3 toppings and I had the rice bowl with a choice of 3 toppings. Each came with a side of salad greens, edamame, and pickles. \n\nThe standouts were the snow crab, soboro, and tarako. Note about the tarako: it's on the salty side, but the saltiness is a great contrast to the sweet soboro and the creaminess of the snow crab. The unagi, spicy shrimp, and pickled mustard greens were also pretty good. \n\nMuch, much better than Sushiritto, which I think is overpriced and overhyped.

"], "author": "Joanna T.", "review": "Onigilly is a cute cafe that is best suited for a light bite of healthy and fresh Japanese onigilly.  I think it's important to not have an expectation that you're going to be stuffed after eating here.\n\nI am a light eater at lunch time (typically) and after having two onigilly (1- pork and 1-chicken teriyaki) I was still hungry. Yikes! I wish there were a variety of creative, homemade sauces available for the onigilly, just in case you'd like something other than hot/spicy sauce to dip your onigillys in. I found the pork onigilly to have flavor but was a little bit dry.\n\nSince I didn't do a set meal/rice bowl/salad bowl, I went back to the cashier and ordered a seaweed side salad. This was flavorful and a lovely shade of sea green, the seaweed mound sitting on a few strands of lettuce.\n\nPricing comes out to about $3.00 per onigilly including tax a la carte. I think the quality of the ingredients and the freshness of product result in this above average cost.\n\nThe staff are super polite and are patient!\n\nI like the fact that this business started out as a food cart and has found enough backing to open this shop.
