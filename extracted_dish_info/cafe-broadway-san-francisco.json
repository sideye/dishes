I came here with high hopes as a lover of Hong Kong-style Chinese food. The decor and customer service were great, but what dragged my rating of Cafe Broadway down was the food.\n\n~ Atmosphere:\n\nIt's a tiny, bustling cafe with a modern sleek look. The place is quite busy, so prepare for a loud Cantonese atmosphere. However, they somehow manage to keep this place clean and well managed despite the constant flow of customers.\n\n~ Customer Service:\n\nEfficient, albeit a little bit rushed. I understand they're busy, but prepare to be greeted in frantic manners by the staff as they try to multi-task through all their customers. However, the food did come quickly, which I was happy about.\n\n~ Food:\n\nWhere Cafe Broadway fell flat for me. I was really hoping for an awesome experience here given how busy this place was (it MUST be good, I thought).\n\nWhat we ordered....\n\n- Baked Portuguese Chicken w/ Rice: One of my favourite Hong Kong style dishes. They really skimped on the sauce so it was a really bland dish, but they then tried to make it up by putting a layer of baked cheese over everything. I kid you not, there was more of a cheese flavour than a rich sauce flavour.\n\n- Ho Fun: Again, one of my favourite dishes that ultimately fell flat. The ho fun has the same exact problem as the Portuguese chicken; there was very little flavour. Usually ho fun is supposed to be rich and packed full of flavour, but here I just got a light taste of sweet soy sauce.\n\n---\n\nTo be fair, everything was edible. The meats were cooked well and the textures were great. I didn't hate any particular dish but they really skimped on the flavour, turning some of my favourite dishes into bland \"meh\"s.
