Neither wet crust nor a mouthful of sauce appeals to me.\nHowever, the cornmeal crust on this deep dish pizza is delightfully crunchy and substantially thick enough to support the weight of the filling. \nInstead of a heavy tomato sauce, the interior was stuffed with spinach and mushrooms. There was so much spinach that I think they must have saut\u00e9ed and wilted down the leaves first before mixing it into the creamy ricotta & feta. \nAlso, it was so incredibly cheesy that the gooey strings just kept on stretching. \nSince the tomato sauce sits on top of the cheesy filling, the crust does not absorb the moisture from the sauce. The order of the toppings must be the reason why their pizzas come out solid and crunchy instead of wet and soggy.\n\n$12.50 Spicy Chicken Wings - pound of wings with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing:\nThese wings seemed to be baked with a spice rub, as opposed to fried. The result is considerably less messy than most chicken wings. It had quite a bit of heat and spicy kick to it, which I attempted to quell with the baby carrots.

One is Patxi's and the other being Little Star. From the rumorville, Patxi's has the better sauce on top, while Little Star has the better crust on the bottom.\n\nTHE SLICE IS RIGHT\nI ordered the smaller 9 inch size, rather than the larger 12 inch, knowing very well that these deep dish pizzas make your stomach quite full. One half of the Classic and the other fifty percent as the Little Star. It takes about 25 minutes to prepare. The Classic contains sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green bells. The Little Star has spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, and garlic. I'll make sure to add sausage to the Little Star next time, but more on that later.\n\nI pretentiously favored the Classic, given that it had the combination of toppings that I liked. But, the side that contained the Little Star was far superior. Probably because of the salty and tangy taste of the different cheeses that the other half lacked. For not having any meat topping whatsoever, it was quite scrumptious.\n\nThe crust felt rather delicate, yet crisp with a flaky quality. Just the right amount of lightly sweet tomato sauce and seasoning. I normally don't enjoy deep dish pizzas that are super thick and bready, when it's so hard to chew because there's so much of the cornmeal crust. This however, was different. For those of you that's had the deep dish pizza crust at Masa of Echo Park in Southern CA, this version is way, way better.\n\nIf you're gonna have the Deep Dish, you gotta try the Thin Crust, right?

Based on the plethora of 5-star reviews and the considerable delay for a table, I anticipated nothing less than the \"Soup Nazi\" treatment from the staff; I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nMy buddy and I were wisely advised by the many reviews here, to pre-order the deep-dish pizza in advance, since it takes 35 minutes to prepare.  This was good planning, as we were famished, and luckily we got a table at just around the 30 minute mark; pizza arrived about 10 minutes later.  So we ordered a couple of appetizers to share, including their Spicy Chicken Wings (not to be confused for Buffalo style), and the Caprese salad, the latter of which was the highlight of the menu.

If this represents the best that San Francisco has to offer, then by all means avoid the city like the plague when you have a pizza craving.  While the pie was hearty and loaded with all the stuff your cardiologist warned you about, it wasn't worth the indulgence.  Sausage that tasted on the verge of its expiration date, ditto for the pepperoni; a lumpy layer of acidic and metallic-tasting tomato sauce; chicken that was roasted to dry flavorless-ness; and a dry cornmeal crust that reminded me of muffins that were on the clearance rack at Safeway.  I think if we weren't nearly starving by the time  this pie was served, this wreck would have gone back to the kitchen for a re-do.  It was edible in a pinch, but barely so.\n\nAgain, thank you to all the staff for being courteous.

Ever since I saw Nish wax on about it on \"Check Please! Bay Area\", I had been curious what the fuss was all about. But like many who caught sight of the place from the outside, I merely shrugged at the sight of the waiting throngs.\n\nYesterday was a particularly blustery day, and Little Star was not even our first choice. I had actually been meaning to try the bar burger at NOPA. Even though both places open at 5PM, NOPA doesn't serve food until 6, so alas, that will have to wait for another time. Even at a scant 2 1/2 blocks between establishments, it was like barreling through a wind tunnel on Divisadero, though I was heartened to see that Lilly's Bar-B-Q finally replaced their old Brothers-in-Law sign.\n\nIf you wait about ten minutes before 5, you get the privilege of waiting in the little cove of a doorway. One by one, the staff - all very skinny and on bicycles (...I hate them) - give the secret knock and enter the door, as we shiver in the cold wind. Jamie W. and I got dibs on the table next to jukebox. No reason except it provided a bit more light than the ones in the back, and we ended up dodging a bullet when a gaggle of shrieking, South Asian girls galumphed toward the back... apparently to raise the decibel level of the place several inches.\n\nWe were hungry, famished really, so we ordered the $8 Spicy Chicken Wings as an appetizer. Unlike those served at honky-tonk bars across this great land of ours, these were blessedly not greasy, and the spiciness provided a great kick even when doused in the cooling blue cheese dressing. I would have licked the ramekin dry had I not realized I was in public. Oh...and I ate the accompanying mini-carrot sticks so I could pretend I had a vegetable.\n\nGiven the excessive protein content of our appetizer, we went for the small Little Star Special ($17), a smart choice as it turns out. I refuse to call it Chicago-style pizza since a meal at Giordano's or Gino's East could hardly be more different. First, the crust was a lot lighter and crunchier than a standard-issue deep-dish pizza with a cornmeal flavor and consistency similar to what they served at Nancy's in Chicago.\n\nSecond, the filling was a lot fresher-tasting, not the heavy tomato sauce I would normally associate with deep-dish pizza. In fact, the fresh tomatoes used in the sauce moistened the bottom just enough to make the crust that much easier to chew without overwhelming it. The equally fresh spinach had obviously been reduced and then mixed with ricotta, feta and sauteed onions. The combination was ideal, and if a deep-dish pizza could ever taste light, they actually achieve that objective here.\n\nI like the place, even though it was a bit too trendy-dark for my taste. Definitely go as early as you can to avoid the inevitable wait. But if you wait, rest assured, your patience will be rewarded. This is one place where the hype may actually be warranted because...\n\nPie light, pie bright, first pie I ate tonight\nPie light, [Pie bright!] makes everything all right\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...worthy of the hype, at least as far as the Little Star Special and chicken wings are concerned\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit dark, a bit crowded..but a warmish, welcome vibe all things considered\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...fast and unobtrusive...perhaps to increase turnover but met my needs for a relatively quick meal\nTOTAL - 5 stars...Nish is right yet again", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-05-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Spicy Chicken Wings.

The pizza was indeed, very well made. The crust wasn't soggy at all. The best of the pizza was somewhat crunchy and a great foundation for the pizza. I personally preferred the Little Star, even though it lacked the meat, it was filling enough. the Mediterranean chicken had a little sourness from the artichoke and i didn't think it matched well. Overall though, incredibly well made! Water, which was essential, was refilled every so often. \n\nWhat's even more amazing was that after 3 days, I had 3 slices of pizza left.

The heat is definitely there but it isn't overwhelming, it peaks then it slowly disappears, leaving you all confused and wanting to chomp down on the next one.

It was sauced nicely and the crust looked amazing with the flecks of cornmeal on it. So I took a bite, and it was good, you definitely know it was a vegetarian pizza because there was a lot of different textures from the zucchini, mushroom, and I forget what else was in there.

I would recommend for date night, but it is a little too cheesy for a first date. \n\nThe order was: \n\n* Spicy Chicken Wings - Pound of wings served with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing $10.50 (4 of 5) Good flavors and spicy. Had spicy heat but it was not overwhelming. Tasty. And delicious with beer. I totally recommend this. \n\n* Half and half 9 inch thick crust (3 of 5) \n** Half Mediterranean Chicken - Chicken breast, artichoke hearts, red bells, green olives, onions, feta $19.50/2 \n** Half Classic - Sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells $19.25/2\n\nSo the 9 inch was a good size three people. There are six slices and it takes about 25 minutes to come to the table. Mind your timing. The dough was very different. The dough is probably the thinnest thick crust I ever tried. And the sides were very light, airy, and crunchy. Similiar texture to a biscotti, but with much more finer pores in the dough. The sauce was chunky with lots of tomatoes. And I though this chunky sauce perfectly complimented its crunchy crust. It reminded me of how well the Tostito Scoop works with a scoop of thick salsa. It just holds the fillings perfectly. It was amazing dough and sauce. But the pizza fillings weren't strong enough for me. I ordered half and half, but I could barely taste the difference since both sides were heavy filled with the chunky tomato sauce. It looked like they lined the pizza with the cheese, then the fillings, and then topped it with the chunky tomato sauce. When it is presented on the table, you just saw a lot of tomato sauce. No doubt, it was good crust and sauce, but I don't feel like I tasted any  sausage or chicken.  \n\nOn another note, there was lots of cheese on the bottom layer of the pizza and I find myself twirling the cheese 3 to 5 times before I was able to break it off. This pizza is definitely a fork and knife kind of meal.\n\nThis was a darling fun place and if you are a fan of thick crust and lots of tomato, I  definitely recommend trying this place.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-09-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the spicy chicken wings (plentiful and YUM) and the small veggie pizza.

Crust was crispy and not crazy thick which I love because then you can really taste the toppings instead of every bite just being a mouthful of doughy crust. The ratio or crust to sauce to toppings and cheese was perfection! Sauce was very balanced between tart and sweet. Getting the big chunks of flavorful portobello was the best though.

Part of how I judge a city is by its best pizza joints. I've tried to make it a point to visit the best rated pizza shops in every major city I've walked through. From the folding thin crust of coal-fired Brooklyn slices, the generous pies of Chicago, to the fresh wood-fired oven Neapolitan pizza of Tony's Pizza Napoletana here in SF and innumerable shops in-between, I've somehow managed to refine a fairly snobby palate for the end product of cooking tomato and cheese on dough.\n\nMost places with mediocre to decent ratings manage them with the portions. It takes more than a lot of food to make me remember it, though. I need personality/flavor to keep me coming back. National chains reliably suck at accomplishing this, and everywhere else just throws heaps of frozen, processed or greasy food at you. Little Star manages to avoid all of that with a standard of memorably good pizza. \n\nThough I've had several types here, my weakness is the deep dish. It's the only thing I've had that comes close to standing up to the immensely flavorful Lou Malnatti's in Chicago. Little Star deep dish crust is crispy and substantial, the cheese is real, and its tomato sauce rivals most. The ingredients aren't limp or bland. While this is a deep dish, the similarities with Sicilian style pizza are only good: the bottom is the crispiest, and the dough above that soft and pillowy. It's a quality crafted gourmet pizza, and you realize it the minute you sink your teeth into its old-world perfectly ratioed wedges.\n\nThe thin crust is above serviceable if you're a homesick New Yorker, but I wouldn't be tempted to call it better than a Di Fara's (good flat pizza in SF can be found at Tonys Pizza Napoletana, or Emilia's Pizzeria in Berkeley). Still, it's some of the best you're likely to find on the West Coast. The deep dish is where Little Star shines.\n\nThe last I checked they don't sell by the slice, and the cost is a bit steep as you add more ingredients, but for the quality, it's easily worth a visit.

All those midwestern/Chicago transplants in the Bay Area have made San Francisco a heaven for Chicago Deep Dish pizza.\n\nMy standard bearer, for Chicago Deep Dish is Lou Malnati's in Chicago, closely followed by Zachary's in Oakland.  Why are these pizzas so good?  It's a combination of buttery crust that just breaks in your mouth ever so easily and the tomato sauce and cheese proportions.  Crazily enough, you can actually have too much cheese and too little tomato sauce, like Giordano's in Chicago.\n\nLittle Star Pizza comes close to reproducing what Lou Malnati's does, but it falls just slightly short.  The taste of the crust is great, but that texture falls short.  There's an absolutely buttery, airy flakiness in Lou Malnati's crust.  It makes you crave the crust, which is an amazing feat considering how many of us don't eat crusts on any type of pizza.  Little Star's crust is just slightly too crunchy.\n\nAs for the pizza itself, we had the Classic (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells).  There was no complaint about the pizza at all.  The toppings were plenty, the taste was what I expected.  There was a good balance cheese and tomato sauce.  (holy shit, my mouth is really watering right now).\n\nThe wait at Little Star is probably the worst in San Francisco/Bay Area out of all the Chicago Deep Dish places in the city.  Patxi's and Zachary's seem to have better wait times.  We waited 80 minutes for a table of 3 on a Saturday night around 9pm.\n\nOverall a pretty good effort in recreating Chicago Deep Dish.

I've had the vegetarian pizza here as well, and while not quite as good as the Little Star, it's definitely worth a try.\n\nI almost always get the garlic bread appetizer. The bread is served nice and warm and accompanied with butter an d an entire bulb of roasted garlic! If you're a garlic lover like I am, or just trying to ward off vampires, you will not be disappointed with this dish.\n\nThe only reason why I need to dock off one star is because I have issues with the consistency of this place. I don't know if it depends on who is back in the kitchen or how busy the place is that particular night, but sometimes I leave Little Star feeling happy as a clam, and sometimes the pizza disappoints since it wasn't as good as previous experiences.

I make a mean thin crust at home, so the standard is high for us.\n\nTheir mixed salad is really good, if you're into rabbit food.  The vegetables are so fresh, full of perfectly ripe tomatoes and other goodies.\n\nIf you're into deep dish pizza, give this place a shot... it's delicious!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-06-12"}, {"excerpts": ["First, the crust was a lot lighter and crunchier than a standard-issue deep-dish pizza with a cornmeal flavor and consistency similar to what they served at Nancy's in Chicago.\n\n"], "author": "Ed U.", "review": "You must be my Little Star\n'cause you shine on me even though you're far\nI just think of you and I start to grow\nAnd I need your special pie\nAnd baby, you know...\n\nFor my 400th review - count 'em 400 (...and I do get depressed thinking of all the time I could have spent solving world peace) - I decided to review Little Star Pizza because I had never tried it before last evening. Ever since I saw Nish wax on about it on \"Check Please! Bay Area\", I had been curious what the fuss was all about. But like many who caught sight of the place from the outside, I merely shrugged at the sight of the waiting throngs.\n\nYesterday was a particularly blustery day, and Little Star was not even our first choice. I had actually been meaning to try the bar burger at NOPA. Even though both places open at 5PM, NOPA doesn't serve food until 6, so alas, that will have to wait for another time. Even at a scant 2 1/2 blocks between establishments, it was like barreling through a wind tunnel on Divisadero, though I was heartened to see that Lilly's Bar-B-Q finally replaced their old Brothers-in-Law sign.\n\nIf you wait about ten minutes before 5, you get the privilege of waiting in the little cove of a doorway. One by one, the staff - all very skinny and on bicycles (...I hate them) - give the secret knock and enter the door, as we shiver in the cold wind. Jamie W. and I got dibs on the table next to jukebox. No reason except it provided a bit more light than the ones in the back, and we ended up dodging a bullet when a gaggle of shrieking, South Asian girls galumphed toward the back... apparently to raise the decibel level of the place several inches.\n\nWe were hungry, famished really, so we ordered the $8 Spicy Chicken Wings as an appetizer. Unlike those served at honky-tonk bars across this great land of ours, these were blessedly not greasy, and the spiciness provided a great kick even when doused in the cooling blue cheese dressing. I would have licked the ramekin dry had I not realized I was in public. Oh...and I ate the accompanying mini-carrot sticks so I could pretend I had a vegetable.\n\nGiven the excessive protein content of our appetizer, we went for the small Little Star Special ($17), a smart choice as it turns out. I refuse to call it Chicago-style pizza since a meal at Giordano's or Gino's East could hardly be more different. First, the crust was a lot lighter and crunchier than a standard-issue deep-dish pizza with a cornmeal flavor and consistency similar to what they served at Nancy's in Chicago.\n\nSecond, the filling was a lot fresher-tasting, not the heavy tomato sauce I would normally associate with deep-dish pizza. In fact, the fresh tomatoes used in the sauce moistened the bottom just enough to make the crust that much easier to chew without overwhelming it. The equally fresh spinach had obviously been reduced and then mixed with ricotta, feta and sauteed onions. The combination was ideal, and if a deep-dish pizza could ever taste light, they actually achieve that objective here.\n\nI like the place, even though it was a bit too trendy-dark for my taste. Definitely go as early as you can to avoid the inevitable wait. But if you wait, rest assured, your patience will be rewarded. This is one place where the hype may actually be warranted because...\n\nPie light, pie bright, first pie I ate tonight\nPie light, [Pie bright!] makes everything all right\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...worthy of the hype, at least as far as the Little Star Special and chicken wings are concerned\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit dark, a bit crowded..but a warmish, welcome vibe all things considered\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...fast and unobtrusive...perhaps to increase turnover but met my needs for a relatively quick meal\nTOTAL - 5 stars...Nish is right yet again", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-05-27"}, {"excerpts": ["we got the standard cheese pizza, no toppings.

We ordered the smaller size since we were having wings too and it was just the right size. The chicken wings were not bad, but I haven't had a chicken wing that doesn't remind me of microwaveable buffalo wings since Sports Grill (new English rule: double negative bad, triple negative good). This might be related to the wings not being grilled, which is my preferred wing preparation method. In terms of drinks, I appreciate that they have tempranillo and malbec in stock in addition to the usual suspects, so if you like red wine, they are bound to have something that appeals to your tastes. Of course they have beer and white wine too. Also the 10 dollar corkage fee is appreciated.\n\nService (4): Great, friendly service. The timing of the dishes arriving was perfect and I don't know if it's coincidence or the server putting in the order in a certain way or us eating at just the right rate.

Can't we all just get along? \n\nAnyway, I wasn't that hungry when I walked in but after that long wait, I was ready for some killer pizza.  I had the Little Star deep dish and the house salad.  We got a large for 2 people and had four slices left over.  Delicious crust and ingredients.  Oh, and then we also ordered the homemade cheesecake because nothing tops off deep dish pizza better than deep dish cheesecake.

", "Thanks ", "Peter - "], "author": "Glenn G.", "review": "It's staggering to think about how many pizza joints there are in the Bay Area.  Even if you consider only the ones in a single category, say Chicago-style, there are still more of them then there are Doyles in Boston.  That makes it all the more impressive that Little Star is so outstanding that it's one of only three pizzerias in the Bay Area good enough to be included in the \"Holy Trinity\" of Chicago-style deep-dish pizza joints.\n\nWhich of the Trinity is the best of the best?  I've weighed in with my opinion before:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/patxis-chicago-pizza-palo-alto#hrid:rIQ6W8ebPxMBcGCOd1VkAQ Several of my friends have also weighed in with theirs, and horror of horrors: our opinions differ!  With the other two Holy Trinity pizza joints still fresh in my mind from recent visits, I set out to revisit Little Star at the end of February.  Maybe I'd change my mind, maybe my friends would change theirs; either way, you can't go wrong with pizza as good as this, and Yelpers that are this cool!  I organized a small PYE and set out to meet uber-Elites Cecilia S., Janice C., Bobby L., and Peter L. for an evening of world-class pizza, drinking, and (eventually) Karaoke.  Our first stop was Little Star in Western Addition.\n\nThe first of us hit Little Star at 5:30 and immediately proceeded to the bar (we Elites have our priorities straight); a table became available just as the third and fourth of our number arrived.  The atmosphere is a little dark, but decidedly classier then your average pizza joint.  The very friendly and accommodating staff served up some excellent recommendations about toppings, and got our pizza and drink orders started in short order.  \n\nFirst up, we got an order of garlic bread for the table.  The garlic bread is a \nloaf of warm sourdough served with a blend of butter & extra virgin olive oil and a bulb of roasted garlic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=9zl79X8GugMmlChpiTMTNw As I didn't know Peter was coming loaded for bear, I ordered a Red Tail on draft to compliment the bread.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=J1o2YGM2OylQBpRqlUcfjQ\n\nDeep dish being Chicago style pizza's claim to fame, we ordered a large Little Star - Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic, to which we added sausage, as we're all unrepentant Carnivores. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=6IEfuIUvVz5Ko2DKoXOVMA Because diversity is the spice of life, and (more importantly) because Yelpers eat like Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation, we also ordered a White Pie - Garlic olive oil base, mozzarella, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g?select=BYJZd609SPcwcpqCtx67Dg\n\nJanice C., who quite out of character started out the evening drinking water, traded up her beverage when Peter L. arrived; he brought a couple of outstanding bottles of Imagery wine to share!  With Janice leading the charge (you don't think our vesper knew Peter was bringing premium vino, do you?), we had no problem demolishing both the wine and the pizza in short order.  Thanks Peter - next time, it's my turn to bring the wine! :-)\n\nThe $64,000 question - just how good is their pizza?  I for one am convinced that Little Star unquestionably belongs in the \"Holy Trinity\"; their corn-meal crust is without equal, their sauce and their toppings are first tier, and every slice of their pies drips with lush, gooey, cheesy goodness.  For my money, while I think Chicago style pizza is at it's best with double-crusted variants like those that can be found at Zachary's and Paxti's, I'd happily consume mass-quantities of Little Star pizza multiple times a week.  Mammon only knows what I was thinking on my first visit to the Little Star on Valencia Street - five stars all the way!\n\nNow, on to the drinking and Karaoke!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-28"}, {"excerpts": ["I guess you could call this high end pizza as the speciality pizza prices are $19 for a small and $21 for a large, but I've never been reluctant to pay the premium prices....because the quality is truly worth it.  \n\n"], "author": "LaSha G.", "review": "I've been here twice and have been happy both times.

I only had to wait 5 minutes or so for them to accumulate and double check my order.
