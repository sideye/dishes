It's nice to see the space filled with happy diners and a high level of excellent service.  Not having a reservation on a Saturday evening, we were offered a seat at the bar where we led off with some fine New Zealand Pinot Noir by the glass ($9).  We graduated onto mezes and shared an entree.  Our waitress was right in saying this would be plenty of food.    \n\nOf the mezes we ordered, my favorites were:  \n\n*  Feta cheese cigars with pistachio, honey, and cinnamon ($7) - With their oozy, melty, salty filling I could eat these all night long.  I love these things.  I wish I could order a platterful.\n \n* Zucchini fritters ($8) -  These were hot and spicy, crunchy and well flavored.  A perfect companion was the mint dipping sauce accompaniment.  A platter of this would be desirable as well.     \n\n*  Roasted caluliflower with spring onion - I make roasted cauliflower all the time so it practically kills me to pay $9 for someone else to make it.  This was good though (as is mine) and it was a nice balance to the other flavors we sampled.\n\n* Roast asparagus - This was on the specials menu.  Again, roasting asparagus at home is a snap but they added some artichokes and tomatoes and the whole thing tasted good, not grand.     \n\nI really didn't care much for the cracker-like flatbread that they serve in a cup nor the turkish bread that accompanied the trio of Babaganoush, Haydari, and Muhammara ($14).   Both seemed more like supporting vehicles for delivering things that taste better.  In this case, that would be only the Haydari, a white Turkish yogurt dip.  The Babaganoush had an odd grey color and tasted burnt.  The orangy-red Muhammara tasted oddly of nothing.  In the future, I'd skip this meze altogether and substitute something else in its place.  Fried calamari, perhaps?\n\nWe shared the moussaka entree ($19) which proved a wise decision.  Though not bad it was a large serving and its one-dimensional mouth-feel (cinnamony and rich) meant that I would've quickly tired of the taste.  As it was, we brought 50% home for a future meal.  I'd get this again, but only if I were sharing it amongst 3 - 4 people.  \n\nThough Troya was full with people the restaurant had a quiet energy.  It was easy to carry on a conversation, even at the bar.   I think the place is solid, but it might take some careful menu sampling to come up with a meal where everything is universally delicious.

The food was wonderful, and the staff was really helpful and attentive. Check this place out!  The starters were incredible - check the red pepper and walnut dip, and the \"Turkish Fries\". My sister had the braised lamb shoulder; the meat was meltingly tender. My brother in-law had the meat balls with balsamic rice, and was effusive in praise of the spicing.  I had the manti as my entree - centimeter square  beef ravioli in a yoghurt sauce - beautifully spiced, with the yougurt creaminess offsetting the heat of the spicing, perfectly balanced. My order took a while to come out - the staff apologized for the delay; but it was clear that it took awhile because the dish had been made fresh, from scratch! (I always order manti as the test dish for a Turkihs or Afghan restaurant; if the manti is good, everything will be good. Toya passed the test with high marks!) (For a Desi restaurant, the test is the Palak Paneer; for a Chinese restaurant, wok fried green beans with brown sauce.) Our whole party was extremely pleased, and the service was great. Highly recommend Toya!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-07-08"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the brussel sprouts, braised lamb shoulder and chicken kabobs"], "author": "T B.", "review": "I have been told that they recently updated the menu, although I am not sure when.\n\nMy first time in.
