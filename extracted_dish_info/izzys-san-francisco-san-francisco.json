Izzy's Own Potatoes are Potatoes Au Gratin, cheese, cream and potatoes that are baked, what's not to love? Creamed Spinach was better than I had thought it would be, nicely seasoned, was that Allspice I tasted in the Spinach? I was happy with my choices for my entr\u00e9e' and side dishes. \n\nAs for Dessert, I say life is too short, have two and so I did. I am a big fan of Cr\u00e8me Brulee' and Izzy's did not disappoint. The baked sugar topping was solid but gave away with a gentle tap of my spoon, the cr\u00e8me was smooth, silky and sweet as it should be. I also ordered the Key Lime Pie, it was tart but a bit too sweet for my liking, I think the Cr\u00e8me Brulee' was the best choice.\n\nI appreciated the atmosphere at Izzy's, it has been around since 1987, there's only one other in San Carlos, CA. Izzy's is very casual and caters to the locals and tourists but if you wanted to dress up for a special night out you wouldn't feel out of place. What makes Izzy's exceptional are their well-seasoned staff from the host who greeted and seated us with a smile to the wait staff and bartender. \n\nI'm definitely a fan of Izzys.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Highly recommend the marinated skirt steak and broccoli.

While waiting for the appetizers and main dishes, I took the time to supplement the bowdlerised, 25-cent biography of Izzy Gomez featured on the menu with old newspaper clippings on the wall about him from during his lifetime. Although his generosity to starving artists by giving them free drinks and meals in exchange for artwork, as well as his place being the inspiration for William Soroyan's play The Time of Your Life was duly mentioned in the menu-bio, what wasn't mentioned was his Prohibition-era stint in jail for bootlegging (as if that was a big surprise), or that his place was sometimes attracted a violent element, as noted in an article about a shooting that took place there. While I was eating my meal, I was wondering if the poor Portuguese immigrant would approve of the current Bay Area mini-chain started in 1987 (three as of this posting) that was built around his name, long after his original place downtown on Montgomery Street was demolished in 1952, and of the mostly upscale crowd from the Marina that would probably be incongrous with the regular elements of the original dive.  As for my meal, the appetizer of calamari and the sides of creamed spinach and Izzy's Own Potatoes (aka au gratin) were OK. However, I was a bit disappointed with my the generic steak fries that the person seated next to me had; it looked as though it had just come out of a bag. I opted for a blackened hamburger steak, medium rare, which was actually seasoned quite nicely. Considering the size of the crowd, the service was quick and courteous.

We could not be seated until the whole group had showed up, so we waited at the bar.  The bartenders are great and the drinks were good!  Prefunking before dinner is always fun.\n\nOnce we all arrived and were seated, we got bread and shared the Prawn Cocktail and Calamari for starters.  It was really good, too!  My favorite were the prawns, which were big, juicy, and flavorful!  The sauce it came with was quite tasty.\n\nMain Course - $34.95 Bone in Ribeye 20 oz. (yes, it was big!  Yeah, that's what she said) cooked medium-rare and aged in a vacuum packed bag had some tendon and a lot of fat on the edge, but the ribeye itself was not \"marbled.\"  The steak was not seasoned and not flavorful.  Pretty dissapointing as this goes down as the most dissapointing ribeye I have ever had. Minus one star.\n\nAs for the sides I ordered Izzy's Own Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach.  These were great accompaniments as they added real flavor to the bland steak.\n\nI also wanted to order a red wine to drink with my dinner, but our waiter was no where to be found and I didn't feel like hunting him down.  Minus another star.\n\nFinale - And then there was dessert.  If it wasn't for Robin, I don't think anyone would of ordered desserts.  I'm sure glad she started and everyone else followed suit because I got to try Chocolate Mousse Cake and New York Cheese Cake.  Both of these desserts get five starts on their own!  Superb desserts!\n\nConclusion - Overall, the experience here was good, but next time I think I'll try the Slow-Roasted Prime Rib.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-06-03"}], "fresh strawberries with cream and grand marnier": [], "chocolate decadence cake": [], "napkins and utensils": []}
