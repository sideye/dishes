Who doesn't love a local, authentic Taco truck conveniently located for a late-night-grab-n-go?\n\n- Ordered 2 Tacos: Chicken & beef ($ 3 each-NOMS). And Quesadillas ($8 for 2). The chicken taco comes w/ shredded marinated chicken, cilantro, onions, salsa, lime, and radish. Very delicious! \n\nThe beef taco comes with diced beef & everything else same. Fresh, authentic tortilla + a spice of mild salsa. Meat & salsa together creates great texture & overall very satisfying. (****4 stars for the Tacos!***)\n\n- HOWEVER. This review is mainly for the Quesadilla. I've asked the lady \"Is Quesadilla vegetarian?\" The lady said yes. My 2 Quesadilla came w/ NO CHEESE, and RICE + BEANS!? (what kind of quesadilla is this.....it looks like an unwrapped burrito) \n\nMoreover, the Quesadilla includes a strange-tasting dressing.... that tastes like thousand island.... (By this time I'm so confused by what I've ordered... ***pictures below*****)\n\n- I believe there might be a miscommunication, maybe a language barrier (I do not speak Spanish). I definitely don't think they intentionally did this. However, I was expecting my quesadilla to be cheesy!!!! Even if it was a burrito, it should be communicated to me........... \n\n- The staff actually answered my phone, when I called to ask for their accurate closing time. Good customer service in terms of being attentive on phone. \n\n- Taco truck is located in front of Best Buy.

Anyone who knows anything about Modesto knows a couple basic things about it...\n\n1) It gets hotter than shit (triple digit heat waves are guaranteed every summer).\n\n2) It's ghetto (consistantly ranks in the top three cities for auto theft in California, often topping out Oakland).\n\n3) There's a STRONG latin influence (being that the city limits are bordered by farm land theres a ton of migrant workers in addition to the already strong latin culture in the city of Mo).\n\n\nBased off our third key Modesto trait one can assume that I love authentic mexican food (namely street tacos) more than any other food IF (and that's a huge if) they're done right. \n\nMost of the time I hate tacos from taquerias. Simply put they complicate it to much (no pun intended). The point of an authentic taco is to capture the flavor of the meat, seasoning and a few other elements meant to compliment but not take away from that flavor. There's no need for lettuce, cheese, sour cream and all this other garbage on a taco. It just dilutes the flavor of the good stuff in my opinion.\n\nA properly made street taco will consist of...\n\n-Your choice of grilled meat. Asada, Pollo or Puerco (no chile colorado or any of that shit, save that for traditional style platas)  seasoned and grilled to perfection (this is the key to a great street taco).\n\n-A small amount of onions, cilantro or both\n\n-A squeeze of lime\n\n-SOMETIMES a small dab of guacamole or pico de gallo (be sure to not overdo it as you'll mask the flavor of the meat and, again, the meat is what the taco is all about!)\n\nWhen these key elements come together just right it's a thing of beauty. \n\nBut as I stated above many places pile on as much as they can, overcharge you for a shitty \"super\" taco and then end up laughing at your gringo style taco. Did you ever notice how those small tortillas end up getting all overloaded, soggy and falling apart before you can get halfway through a \"super\" taco? It's because they weren't meant to handle all of that crap!!\n\nWith that being said I've found that the most authentic street tacos I've found are from the taco trucks when it comes to eating stateside. They had em all over the place in Modesto. I understand that there's quite a few in Oakland, not so many here in the city. \n\nSo for providing what's pretty much as close as I've tasted to an authentic street taco as you'll get here in the city (the trucks often pan fry the meat as opposed to grilling it, and yes I know I'm a picky bastard when it comes to this) I give El Tonayense a five star review. To anyone who ever finds themselves in Mexico I recommend finding a street-side grill cart and trying authentic street tacos for yourself.

My coworkers and I were on a mission (pun intended) to try out every taqueria within walking distance of our office, but for some reason, they were all scared to try the truck.  \n\nOne day I said \"Fuck it - I'm going to the truck!\"  One of my best acts of nonconformity ever.  The food is fantastic.  The BBQ pork is unbelievable.  Best burrito ever.  And they have coke in bottles!  Nowadays, every Mexican place in the City has coke in bottles, but back then, before the bubble burst, it was not yet the case.  \n\nDrinking coke out of a glass bottle reminds me of my childhood and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Plus, Mexican coke is made with sugar (no cory syrup!  Yay!)  so it isn't quite as bad for ya as the gringo version.\n\nAs an aside, \"El Tonayense\" means \"The dude from Tonaya.\"  Tonaya is a town in Mexico.

I've often viewed the menu of a taco truck with suspicion.

However one drunken night out in Pomona my friends decided to play a trick on the poor little white boy and bought me some tripitas tacos from a truck outside the bar we had been frequenting.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Sadly I was too drunk to remember the name of the truck or i'd be yelping that.  My friends were surprised at my reaction especially when they revealed i'd been eating tripe.  But I thank them for the experience and giving me the balls to venture down the menu.\n\nSober and in complete control I went to my favourite truck outside Best Buy and was happy to see they really did offer nose to tail eating.  So I made it my mission to try each one.  \n\nI've made a vain attempt at ranking each meat but truth be told with one exception I'd eat them all again.\n\nTripitas (Tripe)\n\nThe pinnacle of tacodom.  Tripitas or tripe is the intestine of a pig or cow (I think these are the beef variety but unsure) which I presume from the consistency is stewed and then fried to give it a lovely soft interior with a crunch that is reminiscent of pork crackling (or ciccarones if you've never had crackling).  The taste is quite neutral with a little porkiness but it is the consistency that makes these five star tacos.  I even once got a freebie from the nice people at ETbecause they were impressed that I was venturing outside of my culinary comfort zone.\n\nCabeza (Head & Cheek).  \n\nNow I'm a big fan of pigs head, if you go to Marseille you'll find them in every butcher shop window and at El Tonayense the delicious, tender pieces are chopped up so you wouldn't recognise them as their constituent parts.  Imagine if you will a very robust flavoured Carnitas, minus the crunch and you are pretty much there.  I presume they are simmered for a long time to break down the meat and would be my preference now over Al Pastor any day of the week. \n\nLengua (Tongue)\n\nBy far the most distinctive flavour of the menu.  Tongue has a rich, almost livery taste to it and again it is well cooked and chopped so the meat is tender.  I like the robust flavour and still pick one up from time to time.\n\nBuche (Neck)\n\nPig's neck?  I have found conflicting information as to whether this is neck or stomach from the pig but tasting them seems to point to neck.  I would say the taste is pretty ordinary and the consistency that of Carne Asada.  That said it is a tasty treat and I would have no trouble eating them but find little to recommend them over some of the other offally good offerings.\n\nSesos (Brains)\n\nThe holy grail of deep end dining?  I really had to build myself up to eating brains as my first experience of this in a restaurant in Dubai was not pleasant.  I have to say my second experience was also unpleasant, the flavour is strong and overpowering, even hot sauce couldn't keep it from taking over every other taste on the tortilla and the consistency was very spongy, almost mushy.  I did however manage to eat the whole thing but I do consider this to be an acquired taste and not one I really want to try and acquire myself.\n\nIf you aren't as brave as me (or stupid perhaps) then ET does offer tasty morsels at the easier end of the menu.

It turned out that they had a great selection, so in true Christina-fashion, I went with tripas and lengua street tacos. Both of the meats could have stood to be simmered a little longer, but luckily Tonayense serves a kick-ass chipotle taco sauce along with the cilantro and onions. The sauce propelled the taco to the next level and made for a uniqueness about this taco truck.
