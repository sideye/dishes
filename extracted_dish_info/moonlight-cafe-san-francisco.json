My sister normally doesnt each lunch and didn't really know where to take us, but lives in this neighborhood and had heard good things about this place.  She is a very busy person and had to just drop us off and take care of some quick business.   Looking at the menu, all of us were feeling a lil unsure of what to order.  The prices seem fairly steep for just a bagel with cream cheese, cheeseburgers are a tad overpriced and just to add bacon is like an extra $4.  However, we went with it because my sister normally does not let us down when it comes to dining.  My grandmother and aunt, each ordered separately and my mom and I ordered together.  My mom and sister already knew what they wanted,  (2 cheeseburgers at 10.95 each with a side of fries), my mom placed her order with a bald gentleman that seemed to be the owner, while I stood there trying to decide.   Immediately he grew impatient and I could feel his negative energy, so I rushed to judgement and ordered a cheeseburger as well.  We asked for 2 canned sodas at $1.25 each and when he rang up the total, it came to $56.95.  Hmmm.  My mom questioned, \"$57?,\" to which the owner replied, \"We use good quality food.\"  My mom is fairly passive and just paid.   I, on the other hand a total penny pincher, thought about it while I washed my hands in the restroom, and came back out and told my mom that didn't seem right.  3 cheeseburgers @ 10.95 each equals 32.85 + 2 sodas @ 1.25 adds up to 35.35.  That would be almost $20 in tax.....hmmmm....I know San Francisco is expensive, but no way.  My mom agreed and so her and I walked up to the counter and very kindly explained to the owner that it didn't add up.  He immediately got testy but looked at the receipt roll in the register and kept repeating that it's expensive because of the quality.  That still doesn't explain a $20 difference.  I kindly told him, that I think he might of misheard our order and with the quickness, his temper went from zero to a hundred.  He yelled and pointed at me, \"YOU ARE BEING RUDE AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE! YOU NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW!\"  And before you knew it, he was throwing money at my mother.  He continued to yell repeatedly, \"I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE.\"\nThis whole time, my 85 year old grandmother was fixing her cup of joe next to us, didn't hear a thing (she has a hearing aid, but of course her hearing isn't totally reliable) and we had to tell her we needed to leave.
