I've never had a chance to experience it down south (SD), but from how my friend's have raved about how good it is there, I hope it's nothing like this. \n\n- Carne asada fries: piping hot soggy fries with an OD of cheese, fresh onions (yuck), jalapenos, sour cream, guac, and pieces of steak. I was only able to handle a few bites before I felt a little queasy from the overly cheesy mess (Artery clogging, fo sho!). Luckily, a can of Pepsi came to my rescue and washed it all down nicely. \n\n- Chicken Super Burrito: nothing to rave about. It came out really simple, but it was flavored mediocre at most. Rice, chicken, fresh onions (ugh!), guac, sour cream. I needed to use the spicy salsa that came with our chips to accompany it to make it more flavorful. \n\nThis restaurant looks like it only consists of a small hallway upon walking in, but they have additional seating in a room to the left.

I haven't found many, or any, places that have california burritos in SF, but I was lucky to find Olivo's.  After searching a bunch of taquerias in the Mission, I pretty much gave up hope.  Who knew that all I had to do was walk a few blocks away for a delicious california burrito and carne asada fries.  I don't recommend ordering both unless you're going to split it with another person or two. But, I haven't had carne asada fries or a california burrito in a long time, so I ordered both in the hopes that I could finish some for lunch and the rest for dinner.  Big mistake.  I finished about 1/3 of each for lunch and was still full for dinner, even after going to the gym. The fries aren't what I was used to from the ones they have in San Diego, so be prepared for that.  They're cut a little wider and seemed to be cooked a different way, it's not bad, but it's different.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-02-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Everything we've had here has been great, the plantains, pupusas, carne asada fries, and all the breakfast menu items are good bets.
