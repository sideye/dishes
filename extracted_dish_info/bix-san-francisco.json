My friends gave me a gift card several years ago so I finally used it for a business lunch.  Being the Friday of the July 4th weekend, the restaurant was only about a quarter full.  After being shown a semi circular booth upstairs, we opted for a conventional one, given my portly shape.\nOur waiter offered us drinks so I chose the strawberry lemonade while my guest had a signature Bloody Mary.  After a few questions, here's what I tried:\n\nAppetizers (all shared)\n1) Potato pillows (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rysfMkV3XiFGPRbTzKQYLQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Think rectangular tater tot (not that one, Cherylynn?!) topped with cr\u00e8me fraiche and sturgeon caviar.  Decadent combination and, at four per order, not a cheap app.\n\n2) Steak tartare - Prepared/mixed tableside and served with some small baguette pieces, I believe, everyone complimented this dish and there was not a drop to be scraped from the plate when we were done.\n\nEntree\n3) Bix burger (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=vg32_U8Ye-7vTsWe6YEtjA) - Very efficient presentation as it allows the diner to construct the burger as they like.  Great that they separated the various sauces and toppings as pictured.  I also liked that my burger was cooked medium, leaning towards the medium rare side.\n\nWhile one of my guests also had a burger (cheddar cheese), the other had the chicken hash and enjoyed it.  Service was efficient as water and drink glasses were filled and empty dishes removed in a timely manner.  Since it was a workday for everyone, we passed on dessert.  Thanks to my friends for 'gifting' me this meal and my guess for making the lunch an enjoyable catch up meal.\nMight be back for dinner, but need to find someone for that romantic meal.\nAny takers?!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-07-13"}, {"excerpts": ["best damn bloody mary ever!

BIX is located within a little alleyway, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown SF life. The restaurant is quite large, with an upper deck with additional seating, a large bar, and a mini grand piano on the main floor.\n\nBIX became a mixed bag of hits and misses, ultimately leading to an underwhelming [birthday/dining] experience.\n\nOdd: BIX is the only restaurant I know where a waiter comes to your table and plops a little bread role onto your bread plate. No plate of bread to pick apart and share. Just a 1 bread/person policy...\n\nAmusing: BIX is also the only restaurant where the waitress comes to you with [some] already made cocktails... and some which she brings in a shaker, shakes it for you, and then pours it into your glass.\n\nClumsy: I ordered my first drink, and the waitress came to serve my drink. She vigorously shook it, and when moving in to serve, almost dropped the entire shaker (luckily she only dropped the cap).\n\nWeak & not worth it: Throughout the dinner, I ordered two drinks. A BIX 'Perfect' Manhattan and an Old Fashion. Both cocktails were horribly underwhelming and weak. You get a watered down texture to it, and it doesn't come close to being spirit forward. For them to call it the 'Perfect Manhattan'...shame on them! I also tried my girlfriend's Huckleberry fizz, and it was horribly syrupy. Her Blossom Dearie was also not the best drink on the list...\n\nTasty: The Lobster Spaghetti was a nice saving grace to our dinner - a silver lining that was well appreciated. Good amounts of lobster, and the pasta was not overcooked. Cherry tomatoes provided some tart/sweet notes to the dish. My girlfriend's duck breast was also quite tasty - nice and tender - some pretty well prepared duck.\n\nNice: The mini grand piano was a refreshing bit to the restaurant. As the dinner crowd came in, a pianist provided some lovely music to set the tone of the lively restaurant.\n\nSigh: Surprise, it was my birthday, and my girlfriend surprised me with one of their desserts: the bananas foster. I sigh at this 'surprise' because of the fact that they charge you for the dessert. Even though it's your birthday... you are basically ordering dessert. The only difference is that they give you a candle. For the amount we paid for all our food... they could loosen up and provide a free birthday dessert. Also, this scoop of vanilla ice cream with bananas and rum cost $10. Not worth it... for this bowl of diabetes.\n\nMy dinner was quite disappointing, and now that I've visited once, I doubt I'll return. If you come across BIX on Yelp, you've been warned.

Time-travel + dinner? I'm in. You may want to dress nicely. Usually, I say any attire is acceptable in SF, because it's a casual city. But in the '20s, gentlemen and ladies were known for being classy, so you probably should try to look classy too.\n\nThe cozy, intimate setting was warm, inviting, and just right. If anyone is attempting an intimate, romantic, candlelit setting, they ought to learn a thing or two from Bix. It didn't feel too cozy or cramped at all. Bix has been around since 1988, so they must be doing something right.\n\nMr. Joy made reservations and we were led upstairs to the balcony level that was full of booths. Booths are comfy, kind of classy, give you a little privacy, and girls like to have a place to rest their handbags. Am I right? \n\nAll the while, the sound of jazz music lightly emanated from downstairs. \nI was starting to wonder how the waiters got themselves up and down the stairs all night, but I think they go through some secret elevator.\n\n$18 Potato Pillows - Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, California Sturgeon Caviar:\nIt was the most interesting sounding of the hors d'ouvre choices. \n4 delicate potato puffs resting on a napkin, like pillows on bedding ... very nice touch.\nThe first thing that came to my mind: This is one expensive version of MickyD's hash browns from their breakfast menu. I'm not knocking the dish. I like McD's hash browns, but I just never get there early enough to order breakfast. \nWas it elevated? Certainly. \nCrispy & crunchy on the outside, nice and puffed up inside. \nEach had a dollop of creme fraiche. The flavor of the salty sturgeon caviar stood out, but was not heavily briny or salty as a lot of caviar is known to be.\nI tried to eat them slowly, because they were so small and I wanted to savor them.\n\n$24 Chicken Hash a la Bix - Mascarpone Vodka Sauce:\nI was attracted to the idea of hash that night, but it seemed more like I ordered two chicken patties over a light cream sauce, adorned with halved cherry tomatoes. \nI liked the vodka sauce, but it didn't have enough flavor. Chicken already doesn't have much flavor, so I was hoping the sauce would do it.\nI did feel like they did something interesting with chicken, but not something I would crave. \n\n$28 Black Truffle Cheese Burger - On Rye with Truffle Fries, served open-faced:\nThick, juicy beef patty cooked just right - medium-rare, golden brown on the outside, and pink on the inside. The cheese was melted over the patty just the way I like. It was topped with an entire ring of caramelized onions. Great, that's the only way I'll eat onions on a burger. None of that annoying raw onion nonsense. It was accompanied with a pile of arugula on the side. I wasn't all that interested in an open-faced burger though.\nI don't care for fries,  but Mr. Joy, the French fry lover, said the fries were good, but couldn't really taste the flavor of truffles.\n\n$10 Warm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding:\nThis was more like a rich chocolate brownie topped with a mound of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with chocolate sauce. If I didn't know what it was, I wouldn't have guessed that this is bread pudding. It doesn't have the consistency or texture of bread pudding, or the custard flavor of bread pudding. \nHowever it is, of course, delicious. It's hard not to like chocolate. Hot, gooey, rich, decadent, fudgy chocolate.\n\nThis would probably be 5 stars for me if I were more wowed by the food. I should have stuck to my usual favorites and ordered the steak tartare or bone marrow.

Atmosphere--Don't let the alley like entrance fool you... the small neon sign marking the entrance to this place is like a beacon to times past.  The venue is small but not stuffy, with an elegant staircase leading to a balcony/terrace second level of intimate tables which wraps along the edge of the restaurant just high enough above the main and slightly crowded lower floor.

I wasn't as fond of the caviar as I was the black truffles... which was nestled on creme fraiche and potato pillows (which was eerily like fancy tater tots with sour cream), and just added a jelly-salty consistency.

It wasn't long til the hostess came and told us that our table was ready. We were seated adjacent to the live band, and though the environment was very noisy, we found our experience to be pleasant and entertaining. \n\nFor starters: \n-Potato pillows \n-Steak tartare \n-Chilled Fioe Gras \n-Bone marrow \n\nEverything was divine! Bone marrow was slurping fantastic! The potato pillows (tater-tots topped with caviar) were yummy, crispy and appetizing. Steak tartare could have been the best I've had, the chilled Fioe Gras was creamy and savory. \n\nFor entrees: \n-Maine lobster spaghetti \n-American Kobe bavette steak \n\nWe informed our waitress that we would be sharing the entree and she had our entrees come out in split plates. The lobster pasta was very inviting after the appetizers we had a few minutes before. The savory cream sauce, the sweetness of the lobster meat and the tangy taste from the tomatoes really accommodated each other. The well seasoned Kobe steak was tender and mouth watering. \n\nFor sides: \n-Truffled French fries \n\nCould have done without. We were so into our entree that we neglected the side dish. Our eyes were, as always, bigger than our stomach. \n\nFor dessert: \n-Warm chocolate brioche bread pudding \n\nVery chocolaty and rich. We should have chosen a dessert that would have been more refreshing on our palette after the hefty meal we had. \n\nHad a very nice experience here. Will definitely come back for more.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-01-16"}, {"excerpts": ["french cut pork chop and kobe steak are my favorite 3 entrees, ", "althought ", "I have never heard anyone complain about anything served at Bix.

The atmosphere is quite modern and on the verge of being gothic. It's great for romantic couples, business dates, or anniversaries. The feeling is somewhat stern and serious, almost cold, but it clearly knows what it wants to be.\n\nThe food is like a contrast of the interior. All of our appetizers were good. The only issue I had with the appetizers, that being there was only one textural element -- soft. That being said they executed the dishes very well and the softness felt luxurious. Our main dishes carried along the same richness and quality. Usually the appetizers turn out much better than the main course but I felt it was just as good. The desserts are good as well although the selection is tired and uninspired. How many places serve creme brulee, bread pudding, and bananas foster? It's good if you're looking for a traditional selection.\n\nI recommend BIX if you're looking for a high end experience with consistent quality food that makes you feel like getting a luxurious experience.

Despite our tardiness, the host was nice enough to give us the next table which ended up being on the upper level overlooking the bar - great view! Bonus points for that.\n\nNow, BIX is one of those establishments that can be described as classy, old-fashioned, yet elegant. It reminds me of Harris' Restaurant, another place where you can relax and rely on professional, understated service and great food. Neither is cheap, but then again, you get what you pay for in this case.\n\nOur gustatory goal was confounded by the fact that BIX has not one, but two burgers. The one that gets the main billing on the menu is the Truffled Pecorino Cheese Burger served on buttered rye, costing you a pretty $27. The burger we were after is called simply Club Cheese Burger and it's hidden in a small box at the bottom of the page. We each ordered that burger, varying only the cheese, and the waiter didn't bat an eye despite it being pretty much the lowest-priced entree on the menu. We decided to get some drinks too.

According to the Garfinkle, Bix is a type of saloon slash supper club.  Located in Jackson Square, it is totally innocuous, save for a lone neon sign.  However, once you step in, you are transported to a world of tommy guns and a bar which many magazines have said made, \"San Francisco's best cocktails\".  After closing up shop at noon, our party of four arrived at Bix for our 11:30 reservation.  We were immediately attended to by a tuxedo'd man who immediately passed us off to the hostess who ushered us upstairs to a wonderfully located corner table.  Upon first glance, Bix was rather impressive in a throwback sort of way.  The bar was elegant and huge, with hundreds of bottles lined against the wall.  There were paintings on the walls and it was very throwback of the 20's, the golden age of crime.  There was a piano at the side.  All Bix needed were a dozen men in trench coats smoking and buxom babes walking around in bunny suits.   The Garfinkle explained to me that Bix only served lunch during the holidays.  He ordered the chicken hash, I ordered the Louisiana flounder, the Admiral had the smoked trout salad and the OT had the pasta with crab.  We also ordered a bunch of appetizers.  \n\ndeviled eggs with truffles, radish and chives: 3/5  I love deviled eggs and can literally eat them like chips.  However, these were a little too fancy for my tastes.  I think it was the radish that muted the flavour of the yolk.\n\nsalmon tartare on rye with dill and creme fraiche: 5/5  The salmon was so buttery and literally melted in your mouth.  It was delicious and the only thing that sucked was that there were only four small goddam pieces.  \n\nsweet onion and truffled cheese croques: 3.5/5  These were in essence, small gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  We got this upon the waitresses's recommendation.  It was good, however, not great.\n\nLouisiana flounder meuniere with white grits, meyer lemon, and tory farm grapes: 3.5/5.  I was stoked about this dish as I haven't had flounder in a while however, left with mixed feelings.  The fish was very tender, however, it was so rich.  I felt that there was just too much butter used.  I was never a big fan of grits, as I never really tasted anything.  However, the heavily buttered fish went real well with the grapes.  It sort of made the entree a candied experience.  It is hard to explain.\n\nPanna cotta/creme brulee: 4/5  I am not a dessert person and because I never had panna cotta, Garfinkle insisted I try it.  It was a good dessert, not too sweet, and went very well with the quince and candied walnuts.  The creme brulee was...well...creme brulee.  Nothing much to note here.  Obviously, the torched top was the best part.  The vanilla beans were also visible.  \n\nWe had a great bottle of wine which names escapes me.  I also ordered a Negroni, which is a gin, vermouth, bitters mixture.  In french, it is called l'apertif.  It basically is good to increase your appetite.

Jerry chose the fish selection of the day, Diver scallops with favas, fennel, fresh parsley oil, and a variety of other flavors...

Suddenly, I'm finding myself craving the $$$, far-away locales than the regular places I've been frequenting around my area.\n\nI came across BIX on Yelp and was really interested in trying the marrow bones and other items on their menu. Many of the reviews spoke positively about this long-standing restaurant in a \"hidden alley\" which greatly intrigued me. So, today was the day that my hubs promised and off we went. For some strange reason, we came across bad luck with traffic leaving our area and again just before exiting.. so we arrived about 15-20 minutes late for our rezzies. Upon entering, they took our coats and were still able to accommodate us with an open table.\n\nAt our table, a cute little card said \"Happy Anniversary\" and within a few moments our server, Doug, was there to start us off with some drinks. We ordered a heineken for the husband (I know) and a BIX Ricky. A few moments later, the complimentary bread came out which satiated our empty stomachs for the time being.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n- TRUFFLED FRENCH FRIES $8.95: These are always good anywhere I order them. They came with two sauces: ketchup and one other sauce I can't pinpoint. I really wish we ordered another one of these. They are to die for!\n- STEAK TARTARE $13.95: It was our first time ordering this so it was an interesting experience and taste. The raw steak was prepared tableside and was eaten with toasted bread. I can't say that I liked or disliked this dish.. it requires a more sophisticated palate to be able to discern its quality.. my palate is not at that level just yet. Although it was interesting to try, the flavors in this dish would not warrant my ordering it the next time I am here.\n- MARROW BONES $11.75: This is a first for us as well, at least in ordering it at a fancy restaurant. I didn't really know what to expect but when it arrived it peaked my interests. I scooped out the marrow and put it on the bread and topped it off with some of the parsley/shallot salad. This, too, requires a more sophisticated person to judge it.. as trying it for the first time I can't say whether it was good or not. What I do know is that I would pass on it the next time around.\n- KOBE BAVETTE ENTREE $34.95: My husband ordered this dish and was very satisfied with it. The kobe beef bavettes were flavorful and juicy, cooked to perfection at medium rare. The pommes puree it came with was good. I ate one of the roasted cipollini onions which was good with a slightly sweet taste. He was very happy with this dish and I agreed it was well cooked and flavored. \n- AHI TUNA WITH BLACK MUSSELS ENTREE $29.95: At this point in the meal, I was full. I had a glass of chardonnay waiting to accompany this dish and I could only enjoy both slowly before I would burst. The ahi tuna was tender and perfectly seared on the outside. The black mussels were a great accompaniment to the ahi tuna as well as the green olives and toasted bread pieces in the dish. I also enjoyed the butter beans and the syrah sauce of the dish. I ate it all even though I was full. It was packed with little goodies but nothing that was too filling to prevent me from finishing it. I would order this again.\n- 1 2007 SILVERADO CHARDONNAY $10.00: Good pour on the BIX chardonnay. Went well with the ahi tuna dish.\n- 3 ADDITIONAL HEINEKENS $18.00: Drank it straight from the bottle. Classy.\n- BANANAS FOSTER $8.75: Cold vanilla bean ice cream with warm dark rum syrup and bananas poured on top. Perfect end to our dinner. Very sweet, but delightful. A must share! Thank you BIX for treating us to this on the house :) Very generous and unexpected!\n\nTOTAL: $200 including tip.\n\nPricey but worth the experience and trip.

Fried oysters on the other hand were not really hot, nor anywhere near as luscious as those at (again) Presidio Social Club, the only other place I've had fried oysters recently. \n\nThe cheeseburger was GREAT - sort of a fancy patty melt, open face with a big slice of grilled onion on top and thick rye bread underneath. I think the burger was stuffed with mushrooms? Hot stuff. Side of ceviche was also very good, and a very nice bright, fresh contrast to the meat, juicy burger.

Take for example, \"Sformato.\" This unpronouncably-beautiful word doesn't even have its own wikipedia page, and although it is described in a few websites, I am still not even convinced it exists outside of Bix Restaurant. That being said, the fact that it is pumpkin-sage flavored makes me not really care what you call it. It, like just about everything else on the menu, though unpronounceable, was delicious. I give Bix a 5-out-of-5 on taste.\n\n    My lamb, served medium rare, was, the best lamb I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The Cheese and Prosciutto was like eating sorbet on an incredibly hot day, but the opposite. Instead of a cool citrus burst, it was like a warm, sensual caressing of the tongue. (They actually did have blood orange and tangerine sorbet for dessert which wasn't that good, a fact I am happy to overlook because a) I was too full to eat it and b) It was cold outside and it was just a bad decision). I was fortunate enough also to have a bite of my aunt's gourmet cheeseburger. It was as good as any gourmet burger out their so if you are a finicky eater, the burger is a great way to go. It comes with fries which are good, but the side order of truffled fries (french fries topped with pecorino cheese and white truffle oil) were completely, outrageously, yummy. We couldn't decide between ordering these fries and the whipped potatoes; we made no mistake. Chef Bruce Hill definitely knows what he is doing.\n\n    Atmosphere wise, I couldn't really ask for better. They had a live piano player to which my mother commented, \"I feel like I am in Nordstrom's.\" I personally think Bix was much nicer and way more special than a trip to Nordstrom's, but both places know what a nice touch a grand piano adds. They have beautiful paintings on the wall, including a portrait of Bix Beiderbecke, the prominent 1920's jazz musician honored with the naming of the restaurant. The decor calls back to the time of decadent cruising and is complete with funny old group photos with men in tuxedos. They also have cool old maps of San Francisco in the bathroom which I am always a sucker for. More importantly, however, was the urinal. It reached all the way to the floor, which is my favorite urine receptacle, but it also had a bar with a slab at shin level angled in such a way that it blocks any splash back from getting on your shoes. Very thoughtful of them.\n\n    The reason I don't give 5 stars is the pricing. As a 19 year old, I can't really every hope to go back there. If you my age, unless you have the best job ever or a rich uncle that is willing to throw you some Benjamins to take a date out, this is not really the place to go. If you do have either of those things, message me and we can either talk business or pleasure; both would go nicely with their 10+ dollar specialty cocktails.\n\n    All in all, great food, nice place to eat, good for special occasions.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, check out my restaurant blog at:\n\nhttp://www.aaronstrick.com/iWeb/AaronStrick.com/RestauranTouring/RestauranTouring.html", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-01-06"}], "bix citronade": [], "fever": [{"excerpts": ["I stuck with the prosecco and white wine, but my boyfriend had the GBL to start with, which was Tanqueray Gin and English Fever-Tree Bitter Lemon", ", it looked tasty ", "I didnt try it "], "author": "Kori E.", "review": "This place was awesome! It was our big dinner out while visiting San Fran and it exceeded our expectations. It was like straight out of a Mad Men episode, drinks and all.

They had a jazz band playing all night and we were seated upstairs where we (and by that I mean I had a nice view, my boyfriend had his back to the band) had a nice view. It was a tad noisy in there with the music and the people,  but it was definitely worth it. \n\nWe started off the homemade mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto and we found it to be very light and delicious!! My boyfriend then order the lobster bisque, which was VERY good, but was a little light on the lobster and I had what seemed to be a play on a wedge salad with romaine lettuce instead of iceberg. The bacon and blue cheese with tomatoes was delicious, although they seemed to over salt, the tomatoes were salted when they didnt really need to be with the bacon. I still at the entire thing.\n\nFor our mains, I had the special, which was albacore tuna with green beans and tomatoes and my boyfriend had the truffle burger and fries.   Mine was very light and the mixture of the beans and the tomatoes and the tuna was delicious! We also split an order of the creamed spinach and that was absolutely to die for!!! It was SOOO good! I didn't taste my boyfriends, but he said it was only OK, not worth the $27! His fries were very good, I thought ;) Once again we were both too full for dessert! \n\nThe drinks were very fun here! We saw another table down order the absinthe and the waitress brought out two glasses with the absinthe in it and a sugar cube balanced over the top of the glass and a huge water carafe, which melted the sugar into the absinthe! I have never seen anything like this before! I definitely looked cool. I stuck with the prosecco and white wine, but my boyfriend had the GBL to start with, which was Tanqueray Gin and English Fever-Tree Bitter Lemon, it looked tasty I didnt try it and then he had a Gin Martini, which was excellent. \n\nIf you 're looking for a fun place out, stepping back to the 50's and 60's Mad Men Style, then definitely try this place out!

Searched on yelp and came across this place. Perfect! This little restaurant was conveniently located a block away from our office and they can accomodate large parties. Check!\n\nLooked at the reivews and checked out their pre-fixe menu for large parties. Food looked decent and reviews were all positive. Check!\n\nCame for dinner on a Thursday evening and was seated right away. Waitress was very nice and attentive. There was also a couple vegetarians in our group who, by the end of the night, was very satisfied with the vegetarian options that the restaurant offered.\n\nI requested for the 4-course pre-fixe menu for our group. The 4 course also include hors d'oeuvres, and I think this was the best part of the meal. LOL The hors d'oeuvres consisted of prosciutto wrapped mozarella, smoked salmon tartare, and deviled eggs, ALL were delicious!!! \n\nFor my 4 course meal, I ordered:\nFirst course - Potato Pillows topped with caviar - I thought this appetizer was ok. It seems a little overpriced for fancy tater tots topped with caviar. It was a bit dry, would have preferred if there was a dipping sauce or something similar. I would have preferred to order the steak tartare instead (the bf's first course - of course I had to try this along with all his other courses! :) ), as that was probably more flavorful, and I love tartare!\n\nSecond course - Salad - simple dish comprised of the long lettuce and croutons. I requested for vinagrette dressing instead of the original dressing (don't remember what salad dressing came with the salad).\nThe BF had the soup of the day which was a butternut squash soup with mussels/clams. The soup was actually very very tasty! Typically, I've seen butternut squash soup with either large cubes of squash, or melted and mashed into the soup. This bowl of soup had small diced up pieces of squash, bite-sized. Delicious!\n\nThird course - Chicken Hash - First off, I'm not a fan of bleu cheese. This dish was sort of like a crab cake but instead of crab, its shredded chicken shaped into a pattie infused with bleu cheese then seared to get a crispy exterior. If you aren't a big fan of bleu cheese, like I am, then I'm not so sure you would like this dish as much. My other coworkers ordered the NY Steak, which looked very tasty. The BF ordered fish, which was a bit plain. Meh..\n\nFourth course - Vanilla Creme Brulee - This is probably my second favorite dish of the night, the dessert! The creme brulee was not overly sweet, but was made just right, with a caramelized layer that I broke through to get to the vanilla creme brulee underneath. Delicious! I would definitely recommend this dessert over the the chocolate bread pudding (what the BF ordered). The bread pudding was a little toooo chocolatey for my taste. If you're a big big chocolate lover, then the bread pudding might be for you. I've had better bread pudding, and the bread pudding at Bix just didn't hit the spot for me.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars for the food alone, plus one star for the attentive service for a total of 4.5 stars!!\n\nThe next time I come, I would like to pick stuff off their regular dinner menu instead of being limited to a pre-fixe menu.

According to the Garfinkle, Bix is a type of saloon slash supper club.  Located in Jackson Square, it is totally innocuous, save for a lone neon sign.  However, once you step in, you are transported to a world of tommy guns and a bar which many magazines have said made, \"San Francisco's best cocktails\".  After closing up shop at noon, our party of four arrived at Bix for our 11:30 reservation.  We were immediately attended to by a tuxedo'd man who immediately passed us off to the hostess who ushered us upstairs to a wonderfully located corner table.  Upon first glance, Bix was rather impressive in a throwback sort of way.  The bar was elegant and huge, with hundreds of bottles lined against the wall.  There were paintings on the walls and it was very throwback of the 20's, the golden age of crime.  There was a piano at the side.  All Bix needed were a dozen men in trench coats smoking and buxom babes walking around in bunny suits.   The Garfinkle explained to me that Bix only served lunch during the holidays.  He ordered the chicken hash, I ordered the Louisiana flounder, the Admiral had the smoked trout salad and the OT had the pasta with crab.  We also ordered a bunch of appetizers.  \n\ndeviled eggs with truffles, radish and chives: 3/5  I love deviled eggs and can literally eat them like chips.  However, these were a little too fancy for my tastes.  I think it was the radish that muted the flavour of the yolk.\n\nsalmon tartare on rye with dill and creme fraiche: 5/5  The salmon was so buttery and literally melted in your mouth.  It was delicious and the only thing that sucked was that there were only four small goddam pieces.  \n\nsweet onion and truffled cheese croques: 3.5/5  These were in essence, small gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  We got this upon the waitresses's recommendation.  It was good, however, not great.\n\nLouisiana flounder meuniere with white grits, meyer lemon, and tory farm grapes: 3.5/5.  I was stoked about this dish as I haven't had flounder in a while however, left with mixed feelings.  The fish was very tender, however, it was so rich.  I felt that there was just too much butter used.  I was never a big fan of grits, as I never really tasted anything.  However, the heavily buttered fish went real well with the grapes.  It sort of made the entree a candied experience.  It is hard to explain.\n\nPanna cotta/creme brulee: 4/5  I am not a dessert person and because I never had panna cotta, Garfinkle insisted I try it.  It was a good dessert, not too sweet, and went very well with the quince and candied walnuts.  The creme brulee was...well...creme brulee.  Nothing much to note here.  Obviously, the torched top was the best part.  The vanilla beans were also visible.  \n\nWe had a great bottle of wine which names escapes me.  I also ordered a Negroni, which is a gin, vermouth, bitters mixture.  In french, it is called l'apertif.  It basically is good to increase your appetite.  While my supervisor liked it, it was bitter and tasted like rubbing alcohol.  It was basically shit used to clean wounds.  I am sure that it could fuel a Zippo.  I gave the Admiral a sip and he had try really hard to not spit it back out.  This is a drink that will grow hair on your chest.  I am not one who likes to sit back and sip drinks.  For me, drinking is just a precursor to a most savory adventure, often done on Thursday nights.  Our meal totaled out to almost $400 with tip, and for that money, I was not blown away by the food.  The ambiance and service was most triumphant tho and for that, I recommend you come here at least once.  We were seated in a prime corner, overlooking everything.

Overall it was a great night, but I think it may have had more to do with the company than the food. Total stars = 3.5.\n\nSTARTERS:\nDeviled Eggs with Truffles, Radish and Chives: \nThis is the only thing I find myself still thinking about.  Absolutely delicious!! Not too rich, very flavorful, and one of the few deviled eggs around the city that I've seen made without bacon.\nDungeness Crab Rolls in Brioche with Meyer Lemon Aioli: \nThis was just okay and nothing to write home about in my opinion.  This starter has a little too much bread and BIX gives everyone a dinner roll so if I were to do this over, I would save room for another dish.\nPotato Pillows with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and American Sturgeon Caviar:\nThis was pretty good and seems to be a pretty popular starter based on other Yelp reviews.  The caviar was a nice touch, and, while good, not something I would have to get if I go back.\n\u00c0 la minute Ceviche with Chiles, Avocado and Toasted Corn Nuts:\nI love ceviche, but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed by this starter.  I am used to having large pieces of fresh fish, but this was served on a plate with slices of avocado and barely any fish (picture included!) If you're considering the ceviche, I would recommend trying something else.\n\nENTREES:\nWagyu Beef Bavette:\nThe boys had the wagyu beef which came with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  Since I don't eat beef, I didn't try this, but my boyfriend said it was just \"okay\" and pretty salty (which was a theme of the entire dinner!)  He's someone who loves food and loves his meat, so his lack of enthusiasm tells me a lot.  \n\nTrout with Brussels Sprouts and Onions:\nI had the trout and asked that it be made without bacon.  The dish was just okay; I definitely have had better fish.  Even though it was trout, it came out pink and tasted a lot like salmon.  In my opinion, this dish was too salty.\n\nMaine Lobster Spaghetti:\nOur other friend had the lobster spaghetti and she seemed to really like it.  We didn't try it, but there didn't seem to be complaints there.  It came out in a big dish with some bright tomatoes\n\nDESSERTS:\nBananas Foster w/ Vanilla Ice Cream:\nThis was pretty delicious and I would recommend it - the bananas weren't too sweet and the warmth of the bananas foster worked well with the ice cream.\n\nWarm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding:\nMeh - I love bread pudding, but the chocolate was just overkill.  The whole thing tasted like a giant brownie that was too dry and waaay too sweet for my taste.  \n\nAMBIANCE AND SERVICE:\n- Definitely a romantic setting with the tall ceilings and dim lighting. I liked that there was valet which was quick and also a coat check upon entering the restaurant.\n- They initially placed us upstairs at a table and we saw an open booth and I'm grateful that they allowed us to move.\n- However, because we were in a booth, the boys sitting on the outside had to get out to allow us to use the restroom.  When we got up to use the restroom, our waiter came over and made a comment about how we can't just leave without paying.

According to the Garfinkle, Bix is a type of saloon slash supper club.  Located in Jackson Square, it is totally innocuous, save for a lone neon sign.  However, once you step in, you are transported to a world of tommy guns and a bar which many magazines have said made, \"San Francisco's best cocktails\".  After closing up shop at noon, our party of four arrived at Bix for our 11:30 reservation.  We were immediately attended to by a tuxedo'd man who immediately passed us off to the hostess who ushered us upstairs to a wonderfully located corner table.  Upon first glance, Bix was rather impressive in a throwback sort of way.  The bar was elegant and huge, with hundreds of bottles lined against the wall.  There were paintings on the walls and it was very throwback of the 20's, the golden age of crime.  There was a piano at the side.  All Bix needed were a dozen men in trench coats smoking and buxom babes walking around in bunny suits.   The Garfinkle explained to me that Bix only served lunch during the holidays.  He ordered the chicken hash, I ordered the Louisiana flounder, the Admiral had the smoked trout salad and the OT had the pasta with crab.  We also ordered a bunch of appetizers.  \n\ndeviled eggs with truffles, radish and chives: 3/5  I love deviled eggs and can literally eat them like chips.  However, these were a little too fancy for my tastes.  I think it was the radish that muted the flavour of the yolk.\n\nsalmon tartare on rye with dill and creme fraiche: 5/5  The salmon was so buttery and literally melted in your mouth.  It was delicious and the only thing that sucked was that there were only four small goddam pieces.  \n\nsweet onion and truffled cheese croques: 3.5/5  These were in essence, small gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  We got this upon the waitresses's recommendation.  It was good, however, not great.\n\nLouisiana flounder meuniere with white grits, meyer lemon, and tory farm grapes: 3.5/5.  I was stoked about this dish as I haven't had flounder in a while however, left with mixed feelings.  The fish was very tender, however, it was so rich.  I felt that there was just too much butter used.  I was never a big fan of grits, as I never really tasted anything.  However, the heavily buttered fish went real well with the grapes.  It sort of made the entree a candied experience.  It is hard to explain.\n\nPanna cotta/creme brulee: 4/5  I am not a dessert person and because I never had panna cotta, Garfinkle insisted I try it.  It was a good dessert, not too sweet, and went very well with the quince and candied walnuts.  The creme brulee was...well...creme brulee.  Nothing much to note here.  Obviously, the torched top was the best part.  The vanilla beans were also visible.  \n\nWe had a great bottle of wine which names escapes me.  I also ordered a Negroni, which is a gin, vermouth, bitters mixture.  In french, it is called l'apertif.  It basically is good to increase your appetite.  While my supervisor liked it, it was bitter and tasted like rubbing alcohol.  It was basically shit used to clean wounds.  I am sure that it could fuel a Zippo.  I gave the Admiral a sip and he had try really hard to not spit it back out.  This is a drink that will grow hair on your chest.  I am not one who likes to sit back and sip drinks.  For me, drinking is just a precursor to a most savory adventure, often done on Thursday nights.  Our meal totaled out to almost $400 with tip, and for that money, I was not blown away by the food.  The ambiance and service was most triumphant tho and for that, I recommend you come here at least once.  We were seated in a prime corner, overlooking everything.  One thing I might add is they polish and shine the shit outta the floors.  I nearly ate shit on the floor leading to the stairs.

Couldn't really taste the creme fraiche, it didn't add anything but color to the dish. The potato itself reminded us of McDonald's hashbrowns. $14 for McDonald's hashbrowns... That caviar better have been really expensive to charge that much for it! We enjoyed it, but not \"$14 enjoyment.\" I'll stick to $1.25 McDonald's \"Potato Pillows\" next time!\n\nChicken Hash - Chicken-y. Don't know what else to say about it. Two patties with ground up chicken mixed with mashed potato and fried. It was kinda bland. Reminded us of croquettes, but in larger form. A dipping sauce might have done some magic for the dish, but it was pretty bare. I like croquettes and sharing them like tapas, but this dish was not worth $20.\n\nBlack Truffle Cheese Burger with Truffle Fries - The burger was cooked exactly the way I ordered it. This was actually my first time just seeing truffle separately in a dish. I've only seen it incorporated within a sauce or seasoning. I tasted it without the burger and, to be very honest and frank, it tasted like a toned-down mushroom. Maybe my tastebuds aren't sensitive enough ;p  I don't think I'll ever spend extra money to get truffle in my dish lol Other than that, the burger was awesome. The truffle didn't add anything to the burger. The grilled onion on top was awesome. The bread was good. If they take out the truffle, can it cost less please? Couldn't taste any truffle on the fries either. Seemed like there was parmesan on it instead... which tasted good though. Overall, I would get this again minus the truffles for a lower price haha Without the truffle, I guess it's just a regular BIX burger? Any time a burger + fries is over $12, it's most likely not worth it.\n\nWarm Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding - The girlfriend LOVED it. She loves bread pudding though. It reminded me of a tame brownie. The whip cream on top looked like an egg shaped ice cream. I wish it was ice cream. But it was meant to not be super sugary and it complimented the rest of the meal, and ended the meal, really well. I'd get this again and thought it was actually worth the price compared to everything else.\n\nNow then, it seems like I was rather displeased with all the dishes that we ate. But, on the contrary, I enjoyed the dishes quite a lot! It's the crazy prices that were not pleasing to me. I enjoyed my entire time there though.\n\nI'm a fan, but I would not come here regularly.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["BIX Burger - tasty as always\n"], "author": "Jessica L.", "review": "So Great!

The chicken has was unexpected but really good too. We were too full for dessert but nothing on the dessert menu struck my fancy anyhow.\n\nIn reading the other reviews the two main negatives are price and service. For me, the food was worth the price but then again, the husband footed the bill and we chose the lesser priced entrees. Though we didn't have any service issues of note we did notice that our waitress seemed to want to keep our interactions as brief as possible. The manager came by and said \"hello\", but it was kind of odd that he did that without inquiring as to how everything was, how was the food, etc. \n\nAll in all, the music and the food were worth a tenuous 5 stars.
