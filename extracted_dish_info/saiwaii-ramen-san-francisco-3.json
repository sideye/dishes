"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "The Sunset has plenty of options for steamy noodle soup, thankfully so given the typical chilly and/or foggy weather.  While monopolistic competition prevails for pho and wonton noodle soup, the ramen scene is largely monopoloized by Izakaya Sozai and Saiwaii. \n\nTL;DR: In my opinion Izakaya's ritsu tonkotsu is more authentic and of superior quality, but there is only one ramen on the menu, plus occasional specials if you're lucky. Saiwaii is thus a good alternative in this part of SF, especially if would like more ramen options. Besides the traditional tonkotsu/miso/shoyu, Saiwaii also serves gimmicky spin-offs like mala and seafood. (Also, Saiwaii has way better lighting for food porn! Izakaya is very dim and my pics there always look ugly)\n\nThe broth here is alright--not very rich and flavorful, but if you get it spicy enough you will not be disappointed. However it was more oily and salty than I would have liked. In the bright foodporn-friendly-lighting, you can even see a thin film of oil. It sounds a bit gross but it turned out quite tasty, which is why I drank quite a bit of broth and got super thirsty afterwards. Noodles are just alright as well, not quite al dente, nothing special, and a bit too egg-based for my preferences.\n\nThe SPICY MALA is definitely the best deal, since it comes with chicken kara-age, chashu, half an egg, green onion, nori, and spinach. First of all, two types of meat included is unheard of, and none of the other options come with egg (though they totally butchered my half egg and I had to turn it upside down for my picture... sad.) The chicken kara age was not very meaty but surprisingly good, as the thick batter prevented it from getting soggy in the soup. The spinach was another excellent addition, earthy and nicely contrasting all the umami. \n\nI've also tried the SPICY MISO and SPICY GARLIC TONKOTSU, but I think the mala was more unique and better value. I would pass on the extra meat toppings which is an additional $4, which can get you an entire cup of cold brew coffee in SF(!!!) The spicy mala is the way to go if you want more meat and complimentary toppings.\n\nLike most standards for ramen spiciness, spicy is not very spicy: if you like spicy, I highly recommend getting extra spicy. Be aware that the spicy mala is spicier than other ramen, as you may notice with the bright red broth. Extra spicy level on spicy mala is thus wonderful for those who adore spicy foods, terrifying for the spice-intolerant or anyone with GERD. (Fun fact: mala is a term from the Sichuan region for Chinese food, translating to numbingly spicy)\n\nIt comes out to ~$14-15 after tip/tax/that weird extra SF tax--a bit pricey for a bowl of noodle soup, compared to the more budget-friendly pho and wonton noodle soup in the neighborhood, but within the normal price range for ramen. (Especially in SF...Where $4 can get you 3 pieces of pork belly, a cup of cold brew coffee, or a piece of artisan toast)", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-02-04"}, {"excerpts": ["If I based the cost of the Spicy Mala off of what's missing, it should be $10.95 - $4.50 ($4 for kara age + $0.50 of 1/2 egg) = $6.45.\n\n"], "author": "Judy C.", "review": "Many friends recommended this place so I decided to order takeout from Yelp Eat 24.

I even left a note in the Spicy Mala to not include negi - which they abide by but how can the other two ingredients be missing?! The Spicy Garlic Tonkatsu was exactly as ordered...

That's why there was a lot of people standing outside. This place is small too. There was only two servers. I don't know if that's normal, but they were going on the slow side. Like when tables would need to be cleaned, it wasn't attended to right away and there was people waiting to be seated. A couple dirty tables had their dishes and stuff removed but then a few mins after that it was cleaned off. It didn't make sense to me. Just clean it all @ once since you have people waiting! On top of that, they don't go in order as to when you put your name down on the list. We had four people and a couple who put their name down after my friend did was seated before us! And it's not like there wasn't a table ready for our group of four either. That made me so mad to see!\n\nSo we finally get seated. I don't like how you have to sit right next to someone you don't know. No offense. But it's so small in there, that that's how it is. Then they ask you if you don't mind sharing a table with people you DON'T know! WTH!?!?!?! I have never heard of that ever! \n\nGetting to our food. It was...okay to good. We order the Chicken Wings, Sunrise Roll, and everyone got different Ramen. We liked the chicken wings, so I would get that. The Sunrise Roll was eh. I've tasted better. My ramen was good. I order the Spicy Mala. I didn't know it came with both fried chicken and pork. I guess that's what Kara age meant. Everyone else I think got the spicy garlic miso. \n\nI don't think I would come here again. We came here cause it was close to Lands End and we were tired so we thought we could get dinner not right away but not wait 45 mins and then still wait for our food. \n\nI would skip this place.

I'm in ramen heaven.\n\nFor me, the most important part of ramen is the broth and they nail it here. It's flavourful, collagen-y, and not too oily. To make the already rich and porky ramen even richer and porkier, the perfectly braised pork belly cubes are incredibly tender, sweet, and full of flavour. I mean, just look at this beauty: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7Cl-sZlymEjhxm0MJTR7nw?select=9D5FbB5TFH5GQ_khRhWwOw. I'm normally not a fan of fatty cuts of meat like pork belly, but I *always* get them here. They really are *that* good (I especially love the chewy skin on top) and indubitably worth the extra time at the gym I'll have to spend to work them off. The noodles are cooked well and have a good chew to them. Of course, there are also the standard ramen toppings: chashu, bamboo shoots, wood ear fungus, seaweed, and green onions (though I wish they didn't charge extra for the egg). The chashu is decent, but pales in comparison to the marvelous pork belly. I take my time composing each spoonful so that I get a little bit of everything in each bite. It can be a little tedious, but so worth the time.\n\nIn addition to their fabulous tonkotsu ramen, they also have a pretty wide selection of very reasonably priced appetizers and sushi too.

That's what they're famous for here, and it's worth it. They make this very well, and although after awhile you can \"graduate\" to one of their other flavors, this is definitely worth it. I think this one deserves to be on the 7x7 top 100 in SF!\n\nIF THIS IS A REPEAT VISIT:\n\nTry one of their other ramens if you don't want/need such a flavorful burst/spiciness. I'm personally very partial to their Shio ramen. It's a soup that's delightfully lighter than its tonkatsu cousin, but I think just as savory in its own way. I prefer lighter ramens like Shoyu and Shio as opposed to Tonkatsu and Miso, so this works out great for me. \n\nTheir Shoyu has been solid, but I'm starting to prefer the Shio more and more. They're both on the lighter side (as above). Miso is good, but not fantastic. It comes with quite a quantity of corn (haha), so you'll be fishing for corn at the bottom of your broth after you're done. If you enjoy just the tonkatsu flavor, their non-spicy version is still very good :)\n\nThe pork on top of the ramen is very good in a non-pretentious way, which I thought was really commendable. In the era where \"novelty\" and \"designer\" chashus and pork bellies are being blown out of proportion by ramen joints, the simplicity of Saiwaii's ramen is great.\n\nAs for your side sushi, I recommend the salmon avocado and the spicy tuna. I've actually never had their CA roll here, because who gets a CA roll when you can get a fish maki? :P The spicy tuna is quite spicy, but strangely addicting. Salmon avo is always great :)\n\nThe bill will come out to be just under 11 dollars including tax (not for the spicy tonkatsu), and you will leave with a full belly and a happy smile. :)\n\nKeep up the good work Saiwaii!\n\nps.

The service was really nice as well, although everything was a little rushed due to the crowd.\n\nThere are a few negatives though. First off, the front door is heavy, and it slams pretty violently. The first time it happened, I was the one to let go of the door, under the assumption that it would just slowly fall into place. Nope, it crashed. I probably jumped a good foot. Although, the good part is that I got to watch the same exact thing happen to every other person that came into the restaurant that night. Another thing is that since the restaurant itself is small, they have to cramp in as many tables as they can fit, as to accommodate the most amount of people. There was around a foot of space in between our table and the table right next to us, and I had the displeasure of trying to squeeze my way in that gap without bumping tables. I kind of failed at that all night, and I'm just an average sized guy. I'd hate to see how someone a little bigger would manage. \n\nIn all though, it's nice to finally get to try out another ramen place in SF.

I agree with the Yelpers who found it pleasantly creamy, though, and I did finish the broth.\n- The noodles were yellow and on the less chewy side.

I ate all the non-fatty bits, which were few and far between.\n- The egg was acceptable, but was on the cusp between hard-boiled and soft-boiled.  I like the egg to be runny so that I can mix the yolk into the broth, where it increases the richness of the flavor.  The yolk was congealed enough here that I had a hard time doing this.\n- The bamboo was good; the kikurage (mushrooms) were okay but forgettable; and the nori was standard, but not as I prefer it.  (Izakaya Sozai gives you a salted sheet of nori, which has possibly spoiled me for regular nori that comes already in the broth.)\n\nService was both fast and friendly. \n\nGiven that Yelpers seem to think that the dish I had is the best ramen that Sawaii has to offer, I'm not planning to return.

I came here w/ my lovely lady craving for a nice hot bowl of ramen.  Having to experience a cold cold SF night after a rainstorm I wanted something hot and spicy so I got the Spicy Garlic Miso Ramen + pork belly in mild and a Spicy Miju (Spicy Tuna over bread).  Now the ramen was pretty good, nice portion and for $3 extra pork belly I got a lot of belly~ broth was decent, but a little thick and mild spice seems to have no spice at all.  \n\nThe appetizer was meh~ I had better, it was kinda pricy for $4.95 for 3 pieces of mini pizza bagel bite size portion.  Here's were I deducted 2 stars....Now the menu price and their whiteboard prices around the room DIFFERS.  The Spicy Miju was $4.95 when I ordered from the laminated menu, later I got the bill it says $5.95.  I asked the waitress saying they overcharged, the lady came back and said the price is right, and she told me to look at the menu.  I went HA and pointed the price right at the item and then she said oh sorry the price is different from the whiteboard which is right behind me.  Hmmm gee I did NOT think to look BEHIND my back and make sure the PRICE IS RIGHT!  So I urge everyone to look around for their signs and double check the price before ordering.\n\nIf you have a price change then you should simply cross out the price from the menu, use white out or sharpie and rewrite the new price. I mean $5.95 round $6 even, I pay $2 per spicy tuna on top of a small bread that looks like a mini pizza bagel bite.  Even bagel bite is twice the size!  A total rip off.  The price is totally not worth it, so F+ for the management!!  Never again am I ordering your scamming appetizers again.

Although there's nothing particularly unique about it, you must admit anything wrapped in bacon is delicious. The salmon belly nigiri is great as well. The rice ball holds together nicely and the salmon is very fresh. But unfortunately, they have appetizers I will never order again, such as their chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, and chicken skin. They were all very burnt, dry, and overall, not enjoyable.\n\nBut, this place specializes in ramen so, of course, I always order their tonkotsu ramen! The broth is nice and creamy, not very oily either. The noodles have a nice firm texture. They give plenty of seaweed and the one small but delicious chasu slice has an amazing \"melt in your mouth\" consistency. I prefer the regular tonkotsu over the spicy garlic one because with the spicy one, I barely taste the broth, even when I ask for it to be mild. Their miso ramen is tasty as well and not overloaded with bean sprouts, which is a definite high point since most restaurants typically use them as filler. And I have yet to try their spicy mala ramen.\n\nThe service is hit or miss; sometimes they're very attentive and friendly, but other times, ehh... It also really depends on how busy the place is. But regardless of service, I will continue to dine at Saiwaii Ramen whenever I crave ramen on a chilly night.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-14"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorite is the spicy mala ramen which comes with huge pieces of chicken karaage and I like the spicy broth.

That's why there was a lot of people standing outside. This place is small too. There was only two servers. I don't know if that's normal, but they were going on the slow side. Like when tables would need to be cleaned, it wasn't attended to right away and there was people waiting to be seated. A couple dirty tables had their dishes and stuff removed but then a few mins after that it was cleaned off. It didn't make sense to me. Just clean it all @ once since you have people waiting! On top of that, they don't go in order as to when you put your name down on the list. We had four people and a couple who put their name down after my friend did was seated before us! And it's not like there wasn't a table ready for our group of four either. That made me so mad to see!\n\nSo we finally get seated. I don't like how you have to sit right next to someone you don't know. No offense. But it's so small in there, that that's how it is. Then they ask you if you don't mind sharing a table with people you DON'T know! WTH!?!?!?! I have never heard of that ever! \n\nGetting to our food. It was...okay to good. We order the Chicken Wings, Sunrise Roll, and everyone got different Ramen. We liked the chicken wings, so I would get that. The Sunrise Roll was eh. I've tasted better. My ramen was good. I order the Spicy Mala. I didn't know it came with both fried chicken and pork. I guess that's what Kara age meant. Everyone else I think got the spicy garlic miso. \n\nI don't think I would come here again. We came here cause it was close to Lands End and we were tired so we thought we could get dinner not right away but not wait 45 mins and then still wait for our food. \n\nI would skip this place.
