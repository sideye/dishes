I called at the time of our reservation and then again after 8 mins to make sure if it was still okay to come as we were running late due to traffic in downtown San Francisco. This whole time I'm assuming the place is packed and I need to come on time, if not, inform and get approval. She said it was okay to come on the phone even though running late. But somehow after a whole 40 min drive from union square to Richmond, she decides maybe they won't like us to eat there anymore. 20 mins isn't that long, we called twice to get permission, Place was empty, reservation was totally not needed that day.

"], "author": "John G.", "review": "Brought my son here for his graduation dinner because he wanted Russian food and the restaurant near us in Walnut Creek was closed for dinner. I'm very glad they were because I would never have made the trip in to the city otherwise. I was in Kazakhstan for 3 months adopting my son (the one who graduated) and ate out every day at local places throughout the country.  Going to Red Tavern is as close to being back there as I have found anywhere.  I could seriously have been back in Almaty the minute I walked in the place.  For the reviewers upset with the seemingly aloof servers, I must agree with several others in saying that this is just authentically how it would be if you were in Kaz or Russia. We in the US are very used to constant customer service and interaction, but that's just not how it is.  In the words of ex girlfriends everywhere, \"it's not you, it's them.\"\n\nThe Good:  As authentic Russian food as I have found anywhere.  We basically sampled everything that looked good between the 7 of us, so we had a good cross sampling of the bill of fare. Oh and the bread is awesome - great rye bread.  Loved it!\nWe started with the soups, and we really liked all 3 that we had.  The borsch (beet, cabbage, and beef) was a thinner broth style but still had great flavor. The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either. Prices maybe a little high, but not unreasonably so.\n\nOverall:  I have to agree that this may be the best Russian food I've had in the US. Very quaint d\u00e9cor.

I could smell the dish as soon as the pasty is cut open revealing the piping hot beef. \n\n*Beef Cheeks Stew ($18.75): Okay. Americans would consider beef cheek a cheaper cut of meat, but to us Asians and the Russians, this is delicacy. Cut in cubes and textured like bavette steak, it's slow-cooked until beef is so tender that melts in my mouth. Flavor is very strong, hinting herbs and wine. It's served in a metal bucket with a lid.\n\nEach main course is allowed a side dish, which is predominantly potato. The beef cheek stew is served on a bed of potatoes. I should have picked fried cauliflowers.\n\nThe dining experience is good, although service can be slow (one server). Toward the end of our meal in walked a big party of 12, all speaking Russian.

Very refreshing to eat between heavy meat dishes. The veggies were lightly briney.\n\nBaltic Herring- served with thinly sliced, pickled red onions, olives and slices of lemon. On my first bite, I was surprised at the intensity of fish's flavor, which was very briney and salty. I guess I expected this dish to taste like smoked herring. This herrings' \"fishness\" flavor was very concentrated.

It all began falling apart when we ordered bottle of Georgian wine- she brought it out being all fancy, with a white cloth, -explained grape and vintage etc, opened a bottle... and just put it next to Mr.  I mean, why to bother starting all strong with all the explanation if you are not planning to pour a taste?.. or ok, if no taste, -just pour it in my damn glass! There is wine etiquette for God sake. You either follow the rules or not. I actually wouldn't mind her bringing it out and putting in front of me in a pure silence. \n...i don't know why I am making such a big deal out of this wine situation, it just felt very odd, abrupt and amusing. \nThen restaurant got filled super fast and she never stopped by ever again.  \nHowever- food was great. Borsch was hearty, polenta was creamy and huge, plov was well seasoned and super greasy (the way its supposed to be),  my only disappointment was stuffed cabbage- it was cold. They obviously microwaved it but center did not get heated. Too bad since it had great potential and i still ate it all. (Noone bothered to ask how we were doing anyway.)  \nThe best part of whole experience was people watching. Table next to us had very eclectic group of 3- Asian man straight from his home country, clearly on a business trip, Russian lady and Hispanic lady (both looked pretty raunchy). You could tell they all just met and it was awkward for them to hang out.....\n I feel that this is how most Russian places are- they either ignore you entire time and act like you owe them something or give you super cheesy sugar coated service. No middle ground. You just have to take it and roll with it. \nStill haven't decided do I love this restaurant or its gross.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-07-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I loved the borsch (one of the best I've ever had - rich broth, lovely vegetables, perfect consistency) but my friend thought the matzo ball soup was a little bland.\n\n"], "author": "Andrea J.", "review": "Came here with a friend for a light dinner on a cold, wet night.

I'm very glad they were because I would never have made the trip in to the city otherwise. I was in Kazakhstan for 3 months adopting my son (the one who graduated) and ate out every day at local places throughout the country.  Going to Red Tavern is as close to being back there as I have found anywhere.  I could seriously have been back in Almaty the minute I walked in the place.  For the reviewers upset with the seemingly aloof servers, I must agree with several others in saying that this is just authentically how it would be if you were in Kaz or Russia. We in the US are very used to constant customer service and interaction, but that's just not how it is.  In the words of ex girlfriends everywhere, \"it's not you, it's them.\"\n\nThe Good:  As authentic Russian food as I have found anywhere.  We basically sampled everything that looked good between the 7 of us, so we had a good cross sampling of the bill of fare. Oh and the bread is awesome - great rye bread.  Loved it!\nWe started with the soups, and we really liked all 3 that we had.  The borsch (beet, cabbage, and beef) was a thinner broth style but still had great flavor. The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either.

There's also nice chunks of tender beef.\n\nSolyanka (served with sour cream on the side)- A hearty soup for the chilly SF nights. A nice smoked meat flavor and they don't skimp of the meat. \n\nCombination of Pickled Vegetables- consisted of pickles, pickled cabbage and cherry tomatoes. Very refreshing to eat between heavy meat dishes. The veggies were lightly briney.\n\nBaltic Herring- served with thinly sliced, pickled red onions, olives and slices of lemon. On my first bite, I was surprised at the intensity of fish's flavor, which was very briney and salty. I guess I expected this dish to taste like smoked herring. This herrings' \"fishness\" flavor was very concentrated. The intense flavor complemented nicely with the more subtle ones of Pan-Fried Potatoes.\n\nPan-Fried Potatoes Home Style- thinly sliced potatoes panfried with garlic and dill. Some parts were crispy and others were more lightly fried. A variety of friedness for everyone. So delicious, I kept munching on these even after I thought my stomach would burst from all the food. \n\nSiberian Style Pelmeny (with veal) - My favorite dish of the night! Good god, these dumplings tasted like little pillows of heaven. The dough had a little bite to them. The meat filling is so velvety, unctuous, juicy. Put a little sour cream over them. These are so decadent that you don't need to eat much of them to feel satisfied. \n\nCabbage Rolls- My least favorite dish of the night. I'm not sure if I'm into the ground meat rolled in cabbage combo. There weren't any flavors that really stood out to me. But my friends really liked this dish.\n\nOverall, the food was well prepared and delicious. The flavors were simple but memorable. Our dishes came out quickly, within 5- 10 minutes.

Perhaps we over-ordered (we did), but I took home leftovers equivalent to an additional two meals.  This is hearty fare.  \n\nIn a perfect world, every meal would begin with a Blini Tower.  For $38.50 (serves 2 - 3), this tower comes with crepes, sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon (wrapped around thinly sliced-lemon), and another wonderful fish.  We shared two towers between 6 people and it was adequate though I'll admit I'd probably be happy with a single platter to myself.  Pure deliciousness.  \n\nA Russian amongst us explained that we must get \"Olivie\" ($8.75), an authentic  concoction akin to both potato salad and egg salad.  Filling and satisfying, I liked that too.\n\nDumplings (Pelmeny) excited me less than Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsy) which were ample in portion and quite good.  Short Rib Beef Stew excited me more than the pastry puff-topped Beef Stroganoff (very good as a leftover) though that enticed me a bit more than the Chicken Shashlik which tasted like a grilled chicken I might make at home.  Even ranking the food in order of like to like-less however, I come away with a single conclusion:  I basically liked it all.\n\nWith a most reasonable $12 corkage fee and hearty entrees running $17 - $22 Red Tavern feels like a bit of a throwback.  The interior is nicer than that of any restaurants in the surrounding blocks (not a high bar to scale) and is comfortable, not fancy.  \n\nWith one exception, I found Red Tavern to be a perfect place for a group gathering as well as a fantastic spot to sate my hunger:  The obvious accompaniment to that Blini Tower is a shot or two of Russian Vodka, not sold here at Red Tavern.  Just as Trump is overlooking the recommendation of additional Russian sanctions, I was able to overlook the missing accompaniment.  And just like that, it didn't make me happy, but life continued.  \n\nRed Tavern is quite good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.

", "Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n"], "author": "Steve S.", "review": "Red Tavern is a fun place to experience Russian food - with authentically prepared meals in a \"tavern\" atmosphere.  Our party of 6 ordered a variety of meals and shared them to get a sample of all the offerings.  I've eaten Russian food before so there were no surprises.  I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.  Very nice.\n\n- Siberian Style Pelmeny: I liked these - though they are usually served with a bowl of vinegar to dip into - the vinegar was missing.  Sofie thought the meat could have been spiced more.\n\n- Short Rib Beef Stew: everyone enjoyed this.  It comes with noodles.  The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.  If \"rustic\" has a taste, this is the wine that would taste \"rustic\".\n\n- Corkage is $12 if you want to bring your own wine.\n\n- Want vodka with your Bliney Tower?  So do I, but they don't have it because they don't have the license to sell hard liquor.\n\nThe Red Tavern was packed out on the Friday evening we were there.  Service was good!  The Red Tavern has an interesting device on the table that we used to get service.  Just press the button and they show up.  The device looks a little cheesy - but it works quite well!  Press the button and the server shows up in less than 30 seconds!  \n\nNext time we eat at Red Tavern, we will have the beef tongue.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["We didn't get Olivie or blini with caviar, which I know is strange.

I wouldn't say it was anything special or I haven't had a better version, but it was good nonetheless. Now, I wanted to get the lamb kabob, but my sister insisted we get the beef stroganoff. I am usually not a fan, but this was well, just ok. Served like a breadbowl, you have to peel off the little bread hat.

Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.  Surprisingly tender and clean tasting.  Great with the red horseradish sauce.\n\n2) Olivie (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1D9HIvwFfzhqMriEvyL_jQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Subtitled \"Russian famous holiday salad\", think potato salad with a mix of ingredients that included eggs, beef, carrots, and green peas.\n\n3) Potato Zrazy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XvN8YhGfuNCpoozcWY2-tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These packets of goodness (filled with meat, think thin skinned piroshky) went well with the sour cream dipping sauce.\n\n4) Mushroom Julienne Cocette (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lEpgeHjdA8GJ289dD5uZiA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Touted by many diners here, probably one of the surprising favorites of everyone at the table. Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.  A good change of pace from everything else we ordered.\n\n8) Beef Sashlyk with cauliflower (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bR9DnHrEKb-wi_clIJ76EQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and with vegetarian rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ygksNyRu6fKF396Oma9ayw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The beef was unanimously the least favorite entr\u00e9e as it was very plain and lacked character as well as flavor.  Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.  We were glad that they had a  head start on wine and appetizers as we didn't have to wait to chow down.  Walking in, we observed the dining room to be darkly lit but bright lighting under each table, giving an intimate cozy feel.  Seated against the right wall, our party of five was a bit away from the other diners who came and went as we caught up with each other's schedule and plans.  We may have even convinced two non-Yelpers to sign up for accounts... just spreading the word, you know.\nOur waitress did a good job in filling water bottles and removing plates despite being the only person at the front of the house.

The Mushroom Julienne Cocotte was so delicious. It was a mixture of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled chicken that was baked in a three cheese blend. You spread some on the toasted French baguette and it was wow. I could have eaten the whole order on my own. Potato Zrazy - potato pancakes that were wrapped with sour cream, butter and feta. Different take on potato pancakes.  Very tasty. \n\nBeef Stroganoff with saut\u00e9ed cabbage - a nice presentation ala pot pie. The beef, mushrooms in a cream sauce were in a casserole bowl capped with a golden brown puffed pastry.  Beef and mushroom in a tasty sauce?  Yes, delicious!\n\nAn order of Beef Shashlyk with buckwheat and one with grilled cauliflower. Like the sides here more than the beef.  Beef was cooked well and was on dry side. \n\nPork Loin Schnitzel with mashed potatoes - having had Schnitzel in German restaurants, I was curious how the Russians made it. They used a light bread crumb coating and it was cooked to a golden brown.  Pork was light and tender.\n\nGolubtsy - stuffed cabbage rolls. A unique looking dish.  Stuffed with beef and rice and veggies in a tomato based sauce, it was tasty. \n\nNapoleon Cake, a famous Russian cake with vanilla cr\u00e8me in between layers of flaky pastry.  Delicious. \n\nRussian Syrniki - fried cheesecakes with sour cream and homemade blueberry preserves. \n\nRussian Blinis - crepes served with homemade blueberry preserves and cr\u00e8me fraiche.

An order of Glubosky, aka as stuffed cabbage, simmered for hours in tomato and dill.  Pictures do not do the dish justice it just reminded me of being in my Nana's kitchen.  An order of Vienna Style Pork Schnitzel was served with fluffy mashed potatoes, very tasty.  Two orders of Beef Shashlyk, one with mashed potatoes and one with toasted cauliflower.  I wasn't a fan of the Beef Shashlyk and would try again but with lamb.  Probably the most dramatic dish served was the Beef Strogonoff.  A casserole of beef and mushrooms in a sour cream sauce topped with puff pastry.  Elegantly beautiful and tasted as delicious as it looked.\n\nWonderful entrees all consumed we were brought dessert menus.  One of everything was my first thought.

We were told there is no such thing as a Russian sector like we remembered, and it is just as hard to find a real Russian restaurant.   Our attempt to visit a unique one in Jenner, Russian House #1, had failed this trip.  A matter of bad timing and loosely structured hours of operation.  But I do not accept failure easily, so I turned to the advice of a dear Russian lady and friend who gave us one name, Red Tavern.  \n\nIn typical SF fashion, we found Red Tavern snugly wedged between other tiny neighborhood businesses.  None were Russian, but rather Mexican, Chinese, Italian, and who knows what else.  I was totally not prepared for the elegant interior with white tablecloths, red cloth napkins, sparkling wine glasses at each table setting, deep red and gold walls with dark mahogany wood.  The real shocker was, there were two very large parties taking up most of the tiny restaurant and one smaller party of 7.  Humbled, I had forgotten to call for reservations.  Thankfully, the wait was minimal, perhaps 20 minutes.  We got lucky and got the sole table unreserved.\n\nThe menu consisted of a one-page listing that even included their beverages.  \n\nFirst came our bowl of Borscht.  I expected something different, more beet and beef tasting, less cabbage and too light a broth for my expectations, but it had an intensely beautiful color.  A plate of their almost cake-like, dark Russian Rye and butter was a big hit and complimented the soup.\n\nSecondly, came the Olivie Salad.  So glad we tried it.  This was basically a Russian potato salad, but the kicker was the chopped beef and other vegetable ingredients, topped with one olive and fresh dill leaves.  I would definitely get this again.\n\nEven though I was tempted by rabbit stew, various lamb dishes, Goulash, or even Shashlyk, it was the Golubtsy (cabbage roll) that ultimately won.  There were two huge rolls of delicious ground beef and rice, exotically seasoned, topped with a chunky tomato sauce and sour cream, sitting in a well seasoned broth.  Each was quite large, and so I happily saved one for another day.\n\nI had stressed to Mr. B about the reviews that recommended the Beef Stroganoff, and he easily caved.  Bite sized slices of lean beef in a sour cream gravy, it was a surprise to discover it came topped with puff pastry.  It was a showpiece and it was excellent.\n\nOur grand finale was a slice of Napoleon cake,  a multi-layered flaky pastry with whipped cream.  It was simple, but elegant.  With such a filling meal, most of that was relegated to a box to bring home.\n\nThis was a most satisfying meal and a rare find.  I would love to experience this again.

The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.

Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.

One asked me, \"Are you Russian?\" to which I responded, \"Dude, do I look like Olga?!?!?\" WTF. No offense to the Olgas out there. \n\nThat was my only experience with Russian culture (not really an \"experience\" though), other than eating Pirozhkis at my high school beanery. Talk about needing to be cultured. \n\nEnter Red Tavern. \n\nQuietly opening in July 2011, Red Tavern took over Sadko which was also a Russian restaurant in San Francisco's Little Russia area (Outer Richmond). Finding street parking is a biatch in the area but there's a parking lot across Red Tavern that charges $3 for every 30 minutes. \n\nCombing through all the reviews, I was a bit scared before coming to Red Tavern. One star reviews mentioned being yelled at and being refused service. None of my Yelp friends had reviewed the place which made me even warier. I don't doubt the one star reviews. Service was as scary (in the beginning) as when I did something naughty as a child and had to face the wrath of my Chinese pitbull mom. *Hides in the corner* There's only one waiter and he is cold and brusque as can be which means I had to be on my very best behavior aka NO alkie for Cherylynn. BOO! At the end, he did warm up when I tried to make small talk with him so it's really just a cultural thing so don't take offense (just like rude service at Chinese restaurants). \n\nDo note that service is S-L-O-W. Don't come during peak dining hours or you'll be doing a lot of waiting. It took us 25 minutes just to pay the check and our reservations were at 5:30 PM. Yah, we eat dinner like old farts.\n\nOh, and don't be surprised when you walk in to have ALL eyes staring at you. A-W-K-W-A-R-D. We were the only Asian people in there amongst all natives which is always a good sign with any ethnic restaurant. \n\nCulturally impersonal and slow service aside, Red Tavern is a great neighborhood restaurant serving delicious Russian eats in a surprisingly upscale atmosphere http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#am3w0cH3gQHb3qdx3cUYjA. \n\nAs my first \"real\" experience with Russian cuisine, I found it to be most similar to Greek and German cuisine with things like Zucchini Pancakes, Schnitzel, and Kebabs on the menu.

The pancakes could have been crisper but they were delicious nonetheless with the silky smooth smoked salmon, \"salsa\", and creamy sour cream. As one of my favorite offal meats, our second appetizer of Grilled Beef Tongue w/ Creamy Horseradish Sauce ($9.50) didn't disappoint http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#3u3VcwzRs6vvTooH2p4YFg . The tongue was so soft and tender with a slight bite to it. The grill marks added a lovely smoky nuance. Carniwhores would rejoice over their Meat Platter of Rack of Lamb, Chicken & Lamb Lula ($42) for 2-3 people; 2 people if you're dining with a dude or 1 Mr. NSS who ate 3/4ths the platter and would have eaten the whole thing by himself if I wasn't there.

You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either. Prices maybe a little high, but not unreasonably so.\n\nOverall:  I have to agree that this may be the best Russian food I've had in the US. Very quaint d\u00e9cor.

"], "author": "Steve S.", "review": "Red Tavern is a fun place to experience Russian food - with authentically prepared meals in a \"tavern\" atmosphere.  Our party of 6 ordered a variety of meals and shared them to get a sample of all the offerings.  I've eaten Russian food before so there were no surprises.  I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.  Very nice.\n\n- Siberian Style Pelmeny: I liked these - though they are usually served with a bowl of vinegar to dip into - the vinegar was missing.  Sofie thought the meat could have been spiced more.\n\n- Short Rib Beef Stew: everyone enjoyed this.  It comes with noodles.  The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.  If \"rustic\" has a taste, this is the wine that would taste \"rustic\".\n\n- Corkage is $12 if you want to bring your own wine.\n\n- Want vodka with your Bliney Tower?  So do I, but they don't have it because they don't have the license to sell hard liquor.\n\nThe Red Tavern was packed out on the Friday evening we were there.  Service was good!  The Red Tavern has an interesting device on the table that we used to get service.  Just press the button and they show up.  The device looks a little cheesy - but it works quite well!  Press the button and the server shows up in less than 30 seconds!  \n\nNext time we eat at Red Tavern, we will have the beef tongue.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Russian Blinys Tower - 39.50.

But I loved everything I tasted. \n\nThe first visit, my friends (no pictures sad face) had the bitcochek, the fire-grilled chicken (can't remember that proper name) and the rabbit stew while I feasted on their chicken a la tapers, a garlic marinated and (pressed) roasted Cornish game hen. The first time we weren't asked about sides so they all came out with the tavern potatoes. I tried everything and was amazed at how moist and just packed with flavor everything was. The pork was juicy, the fire grilled chicken was like BAM! and my garlic Cornish game hen had the best crisped skin while still keeping moisture and not being so dried out like typical chicken. The rabbit stew was out of this world, but it is rich and there were lots of bones so beware. \nWe all couldn't stop raving about the freaking potatoes, I mean how do they do such magic to something so simple as potatoes. Moist and soft and fluffy, yet crispy too. ALIENS! Ha\n\nThe second visit I brought two new guests, they ended up both getting the cabbage rolls as they had had Russian style cabbage rolls in the past and loved them, while I picked out the bitcochek (marinated, breaded and fried pork loin). To be honest, I wasn't as wowed with mine as I was with my friend's the first visit , but it was still very moist and flavorful, but this time I felt I could taste the grease more I guess. The cabbage rolls came out in a sauce which my companions had said they weren't expecting but let me tell you, did in no way distract from the flavor. We also mixed up the sides this time, I tried the garlic potatoes, almost scalloped with a creamy garlic sauce, I wasn't much of a fan though. And we did the fried cauliflower, which I really liked. Along with the standard tavern potatoes. \n\nI did try the Russian root beer which is kvas, which reminded me of kombucha, a fermented tea thing, normally I would have drank it and I tried it a couple times but I'm immune compromised now and realized that probably wasn't te smartest since I didn't know much about how sanitary it is. \n\nWe also got this appetizer called the Mushroom Julienne Cocotte ($7.50) which was mushrooms and chicken baked in 3 cheese blend. The size was kind of humorous but we all agreed we would eat the crap out of it, they need a bigger portion. \n \n\nThe rabbit stew was the most expensive at around $21.95 or so, while the rest were between $14.95-$16.

Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.

Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.  A good change of pace from everything else we ordered.\n\n8) Beef Sashlyk with cauliflower (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bR9DnHrEKb-wi_clIJ76EQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and with vegetarian rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ygksNyRu6fKF396Oma9ayw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The beef was unanimously the least favorite entr\u00e9e as it was very plain and lacked character as well as flavor.  Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.

We were the only Asian people in there amongst all natives which is always a good sign with any ethnic restaurant. \n\nCulturally impersonal and slow service aside, Red Tavern is a great neighborhood restaurant serving delicious Russian eats in a surprisingly upscale atmosphere http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#am3w0cH3gQHb3qdx3cUYjA. \n\nAs my first \"real\" experience with Russian cuisine, I found it to be most similar to Greek and German cuisine with things like Zucchini Pancakes, Schnitzel, and Kebabs on the menu. We started with the Zucchini Pancakes w/ Salmon Tartar & Sour Cream ($8.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw which were delightful (no comparison to Kokkari's though). The pancakes could have been crisper but they were delicious nonetheless with the silky smooth smoked salmon, \"salsa\", and creamy sour cream. As one of my favorite offal meats, our second appetizer of Grilled Beef Tongue w/ Creamy Horseradish Sauce ($9.50) didn't disappoint http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#3u3VcwzRs6vvTooH2p4YFg . The tongue was so soft and tender with a slight bite to it. The grill marks added a lovely smoky nuance. Carniwhores would rejoice over their Meat Platter of Rack of Lamb, Chicken & Lamb Lula ($42) for 2-3 people; 2 people if you're dining with a dude or 1 Mr. NSS who ate 3/4ths the platter and would have eaten the whole thing by himself if I wasn't there. MEAT HOG! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#TJ_oJAJanLz5PO_w0ZUtPg. The trio of meats all were wonderfully seasoned and grilled to a nice tenderness and served with a homemade sauce similar to a BBQ sauce but with a HUGE punch tangy piquancy. The Lamb Lula (kebab) was my favorite as it was rich and fatty with a mouth-watering earthy spice blend. I didn't touch the accompanying potato gratin but the grilled zucchini, bell peppers, and onions were al-dente with a delicious garlickyness. \n\nRed Tavern is definitely worth a trek to the Outer Richmond to get your Russian carniwhore eats ON.

So we made a reservation for our last meal of our vacation at Red Tavern the next day.\n\nLet me start with the bad.  There was only one waitress and apparently only one cook working.  So even though the restaurant was relatively empty(14 customers at four tables) they struggled to keep up.  In general the service was slow.  Our waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the slowness.\n\nThat being said when our food did arrive we completely forgot about the slowness.  \n\nTo start we have the smoked fish platter.  In the interest of full disclosure I really like smoked fish and theirs did not disappoint.\n\nWe choose the pork schnitzel and the Beef Cheek Stew for dinner with the Tavern Potatoes(I like Dan Q's spelling), Kasha, Fried Cauliflower, and Garlic Potatoes.\n\nThe Schnitzel was great!  As good as any I got in my two years in Germany.  The Cheek stew tasted like it had been slowly cooked for hours imparting all of its' beefy flavors in the wonderfully caramelized sauce.  We both agreed the Kasha and the Garlic potatoes would have been great except they were so overshadowed by the Cauliflower and more so the Tavern potatoes that by comparison they were almost  pedestrian.

Our party of 6 ordered a variety of meals and shared them to get a sample of all the offerings.  I've eaten Russian food before so there were no surprises.  I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.  Very nice.\n\n- Siberian Style Pelmeny: I liked these - though they are usually served with a bowl of vinegar to dip into - the vinegar was missing.  Sofie thought the meat could have been spiced more.\n\n- Short Rib Beef Stew: everyone enjoyed this.  It comes with noodles.  The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.  If \"rustic\" has a taste, this is the wine that would taste \"rustic\".\n\n- Corkage is $12 if you want to bring your own wine.\n\n- Want vodka with your Bliney Tower?  So do I, but they don't have it because they don't have the license to sell hard liquor.\n\nThe Red Tavern was packed out on the Friday evening we were there.  Service was good!  The Red Tavern has an interesting device on the table that we used to get service.  Just press the button and they show up.  The device looks a little cheesy - but it works quite well!

There's also nice chunks of tender beef.\n\nSolyanka (served with sour cream on the side)- A hearty soup for the chilly SF nights. A nice smoked meat flavor and they don't skimp of the meat. \n\nCombination of Pickled Vegetables- consisted of pickles, pickled cabbage and cherry tomatoes. Very refreshing to eat between heavy meat dishes. The veggies were lightly briney.\n\nBaltic Herring- served with thinly sliced, pickled red onions, olives and slices of lemon. On my first bite, I was surprised at the intensity of fish's flavor, which was very briney and salty. I guess I expected this dish to taste like smoked herring. This herrings' \"fishness\" flavor was very concentrated. The intense flavor complemented nicely with the more subtle ones of Pan-Fried Potatoes.\n\nPan-Fried Potatoes Home Style- thinly sliced potatoes panfried with garlic and dill. Some parts were crispy and others were more lightly fried. A variety of friedness for everyone. So delicious, I kept munching on these even after I thought my stomach would burst from all the food. \n\nSiberian Style Pelmeny (with veal) - My favorite dish of the night! Good god, these dumplings tasted like little pillows of heaven. The dough had a little bite to them. The meat filling is so velvety, unctuous, juicy. Put a little sour cream over them.

There's nothing about any of that which brings me joy or happiness while pretty much every Russian thing I consumed at Red Tavern did just that.  \n\nOur party of 6 dined here in the sleepy Outer Richmond, sating ourselves with too much food and ample good cheer.  This restaurant, with dishes that harken back to a time pre-dating the small-plate craze, is proof that San Francisco is not 100% overpriced food from which you leave hungry.  Perhaps we over-ordered (we did), but I took home leftovers equivalent to an additional two meals.  This is hearty fare.  \n\nIn a perfect world, every meal would begin with a Blini Tower.  For $38.50 (serves 2 - 3), this tower comes with crepes, sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon (wrapped around thinly sliced-lemon), and another wonderful fish.  We shared two towers between 6 people and it was adequate though I'll admit I'd probably be happy with a single platter to myself.  Pure deliciousness.  \n\nA Russian amongst us explained that we must get \"Olivie\" ($8.75), an authentic  concoction akin to both potato salad and egg salad.  Filling and satisfying, I liked that too.\n\nDumplings (Pelmeny) excited me less than Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsy) which were ample in portion and quite good.  Short Rib Beef Stew excited me more than the pastry puff-topped Beef Stroganoff (very good as a leftover) though that enticed me a bit more than the Chicken Shashlik which tasted like a grilled chicken I might make at home.  Even ranking the food in order of like to like-less however, I come away with a single conclusion:  I basically liked it all.\n\nWith a most reasonable $12 corkage fee and hearty entrees running $17 - $22 Red Tavern feels like a bit of a throwback.  The interior is nicer than that of any restaurants in the surrounding blocks (not a high bar to scale) and is comfortable, not fancy.  \n\nWith one exception, I found Red Tavern to be a perfect place for a group gathering as well as a fantastic spot to sate my hunger:  The obvious accompaniment to that Blini Tower is a shot or two of Russian Vodka, not sold here at Red Tavern.  Just as Trump is overlooking the recommendation of additional Russian sanctions, I was able to overlook the missing accompaniment.

Our party of 6 ordered a variety of meals and shared them to get a sample of all the offerings.  I've eaten Russian food before so there were no surprises.  I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.  Very nice.\n\n- Siberian Style Pelmeny: I liked these - though they are usually served with a bowl of vinegar to dip into - the vinegar was missing.  Sofie thought the meat could have been spiced more.\n\n- Short Rib Beef Stew: everyone enjoyed this.  It comes with noodles.  The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.  If \"rustic\" has a taste, this is the wine that would taste \"rustic\".\n\n- Corkage is $12 if you want to bring your own wine.\n\n- Want vodka with your Bliney Tower?  So do I, but they don't have it because they don't have the license to sell hard liquor.\n\nThe Red Tavern was packed out on the Friday evening we were there.  Service was good!  The Red Tavern has an interesting device on the table that we used to get service.  Just press the button and they show up.  The device looks a little cheesy - but it works quite well!  Press the button and the server shows up in less than 30 seconds!  \n\nNext time we eat at Red Tavern, we will have the beef tongue.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The beef stroganoff was delectable.

There was black bread and butter, which I was told was very good as it was tauntingly eaten in front of me. We didn't get Olivie or blini with caviar, which I know is strange. I mean, you gotta get at least one of those, neither seems like a crime; at least a misdemeanor. We did order Borsht. I kinda wanted Salyanka, maybe I should of had both..hmm. Good flavor. I liked that there was meat in this one, but I felt like maybe it took away from the natural sweetness a little bit. Sour Cream of course is a must and it was a satisfying dish. Also ordered the herring. This is another classic Russian offering. Onions and some oil. This was good. I wouldn't say it was anything special or I haven't had a better version, but it was good nonetheless. Now, I wanted to get the lamb kabob, but my sister insisted we get the beef stroganoff.

Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.  Surprisingly tender and clean tasting.  Great with the red horseradish sauce.\n\n2) Olivie (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1D9HIvwFfzhqMriEvyL_jQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Subtitled \"Russian famous holiday salad\", think potato salad with a mix of ingredients that included eggs, beef, carrots, and green peas.\n\n3) Potato Zrazy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XvN8YhGfuNCpoozcWY2-tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These packets of goodness (filled with meat, think thin skinned piroshky) went well with the sour cream dipping sauce.\n\n4) Mushroom Julienne Cocette (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lEpgeHjdA8GJ289dD5uZiA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Touted by many diners here, probably one of the surprising favorites of everyone at the table. Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.  A good change of pace from everything else we ordered.\n\n8) Beef Sashlyk with cauliflower (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bR9DnHrEKb-wi_clIJ76EQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and with vegetarian rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ygksNyRu6fKF396Oma9ayw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The beef was unanimously the least favorite entr\u00e9e as it was very plain and lacked character as well as flavor.  Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.

They were enjoying a nice bottle of red wine and a couple of appetizers, Grilled beef tongue and Olivie, a Russian potato salad. I'm not a beef tongue fan since it's usually tough, but this was nicely grilled and was very tender. It was like a nice cut of steak.\n\nWe checked out the menu and each of us were tasked with choosing a main course.

The Mushroom Julienne Cocotte was so delicious. It was a mixture of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled chicken that was baked in a three cheese blend. You spread some on the toasted French baguette and it was wow. I could have eaten the whole order on my own. Potato Zrazy - potato pancakes that were wrapped with sour cream, butter and feta.

The beef, mushrooms in a cream sauce were in a casserole bowl capped with a golden brown puffed pastry.  Beef and mushroom in a tasty sauce?  Yes, delicious!\n\nAn order of Beef Shashlyk with buckwheat and one with grilled cauliflower. Like the sides here more than the beef.  Beef was cooked well and was on dry side. \n\nPork Loin Schnitzel with mashed potatoes - having had Schnitzel in German restaurants, I was curious how the Russians made it. They used a light bread crumb coating and it was cooked to a golden brown.  Pork was light and tender.\n\nGolubtsy - stuffed cabbage rolls. A unique looking dish.  Stuffed with beef and rice and veggies in a tomato based sauce, it was tasty. \n\nNapoleon Cake, a famous Russian cake with vanilla cr\u00e8me in between layers of flaky pastry.  Delicious. \n\nRussian Syrniki - fried cheesecakes with sour cream and homemade blueberry preserves. \n\nRussian Blinis - crepes served with homemade blueberry preserves and cr\u00e8me fraiche.

We were told there is no such thing as a Russian sector like we remembered, and it is just as hard to find a real Russian restaurant.   Our attempt to visit a unique one in Jenner, Russian House #1, had failed this trip.  A matter of bad timing and loosely structured hours of operation.  But I do not accept failure easily, so I turned to the advice of a dear Russian lady and friend who gave us one name, Red Tavern.  \n\nIn typical SF fashion, we found Red Tavern snugly wedged between other tiny neighborhood businesses.  None were Russian, but rather Mexican, Chinese, Italian, and who knows what else.  I was totally not prepared for the elegant interior with white tablecloths, red cloth napkins, sparkling wine glasses at each table setting, deep red and gold walls with dark mahogany wood.  The real shocker was, there were two very large parties taking up most of the tiny restaurant and one smaller party of 7.  Humbled, I had forgotten to call for reservations.  Thankfully, the wait was minimal, perhaps 20 minutes.  We got lucky and got the sole table unreserved.\n\nThe menu consisted of a one-page listing that even included their beverages.  \n\nFirst came our bowl of Borscht.  I expected something different, more beet and beef tasting, less cabbage and too light a broth for my expectations, but it had an intensely beautiful color.  A plate of their almost cake-like, dark Russian Rye and butter was a big hit and complimented the soup.\n\nSecondly, came the Olivie Salad.  So glad we tried it.  This was basically a Russian potato salad, but the kicker was the chopped beef and other vegetable ingredients, topped with one olive and fresh dill leaves.  I would definitely get this again.\n\nEven though I was tempted by rabbit stew, various lamb dishes, Goulash, or even Shashlyk, it was the Golubtsy (cabbage roll) that ultimately won.  There were two huge rolls of delicious ground beef and rice, exotically seasoned, topped with a chunky tomato sauce and sour cream, sitting in a well seasoned broth.  Each was quite large, and so I happily saved one for another day.\n\nI had stressed to Mr. B about the reviews that recommended the Beef Stroganoff, and he easily caved.  Bite sized slices of lean beef in a sour cream gravy, it was a surprise to discover it came topped with puff pastry.  It was a showpiece and it was excellent.\n\nOur grand finale was a slice of Napoleon cake,  a multi-layered flaky pastry with whipped cream.  It was simple, but elegant.  With such a filling meal, most of that was relegated to a box to bring home.\n\nThis was a most satisfying meal and a rare find.  I would love to experience this again.

My beloved and I are both on the wagon for health reasons, but I did notice quite a selection of wine and beer available.  We ordered iced tea.  \"No iced tea.  Only hot.\"  We were both sort of taken aback by that.  (We had water.)  \n\nI had the borscht and he had the cabbage salad.  My soup was good, but salty, and not quite to my liking (not their fault--I make a mean borscht and that's my standard). Beloved loved my borscht.  It was a generous helping and contained a lot of meat.  He loved his cabbage salad, too, and I liked it, but it was dressed with a healthy portion of sesame oil.  Odd, at least to my palate, but that's just me.\n\nWe each ordered the mushroom appetizer, which was insanely good.  The portions were teeny-tiny, though.  The server correctly insisted that we each get our own order, but at $8 a pop, it was pricey for a soapdish-sized portion of shrooms with melted cheese and two slices of grilled bread.  (Still crazy good, though.)\n\nBeloved's Beef Stroganoff was a show-stopper, served in a deep bowl with a huge dome of brown, fragrant bread covering it.  (No noodles.)  My lamb was odd and kind of sad.  I should have asked them how they prepared it--my bad--but they were gray and just...sad.  They were served with a tomato/cilantro salsa--I kid you not--and angel hair cabbage that had been very heavily cooked.  Not bad, but not great, to my liking.  I would never order the lamb again.  I wondered if it had been cooked and reheated.  (Is cilantro a Russian thing?)\n\nWe shared an order of blintzes for dessert, and they were simple and very delicious.  Tip:  get an entire order for yourself.  I ordered coffee with cream and sugar.  I was served, halfway through our dessert, a cappuccino, with a packet of sugar and a packet of Splenda on the saucer.  As the server set it down, she announced \"Coffee with milk.\"  I didn't feel like arguing, especially since she was serving the entire dining room and trying to clean up the beer an exuberant patron had accidentally swept onto the floor.  A man who I presumed to be the owner sat in the corner with a handful of people, pouring drinks from a fancy round bottle of something that looked expensive.  I think if he'd at least made motions of helping clean up that spilled glass of beer and replacing it I would give this place an extra star.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, good but odd.

Americans would consider beef cheek a cheaper cut of meat, but to us Asians and the Russians, this is delicacy. Cut in cubes and textured like bavette steak, it's slow-cooked until beef is so tender that melts in my mouth. Flavor is very strong, hinting herbs and wine. It's served in a metal bucket with a lid.\n\nEach main course is allowed a side dish, which is predominantly potato. The beef cheek stew is served on a bed of potatoes. I should have picked fried cauliflowers.\n\nThe dining experience is good, although service can be slow (one server). Toward the end of our meal in walked a big party of 12, all speaking Russian.

We were told there is no such thing as a Russian sector like we remembered, and it is just as hard to find a real Russian restaurant.   Our attempt to visit a unique one in Jenner, Russian House #1, had failed this trip.  A matter of bad timing and loosely structured hours of operation.  But I do not accept failure easily, so I turned to the advice of a dear Russian lady and friend who gave us one name, Red Tavern.  \n\nIn typical SF fashion, we found Red Tavern snugly wedged between other tiny neighborhood businesses.  None were Russian, but rather Mexican, Chinese, Italian, and who knows what else.  I was totally not prepared for the elegant interior with white tablecloths, red cloth napkins, sparkling wine glasses at each table setting, deep red and gold walls with dark mahogany wood.  The real shocker was, there were two very large parties taking up most of the tiny restaurant and one smaller party of 7.  Humbled, I had forgotten to call for reservations.  Thankfully, the wait was minimal, perhaps 20 minutes.  We got lucky and got the sole table unreserved.\n\nThe menu consisted of a one-page listing that even included their beverages.  \n\nFirst came our bowl of Borscht.  I expected something different, more beet and beef tasting, less cabbage and too light a broth for my expectations, but it had an intensely beautiful color.  A plate of their almost cake-like, dark Russian Rye and butter was a big hit and complimented the soup.\n\nSecondly, came the Olivie Salad.  So glad we tried it.  This was basically a Russian potato salad, but the kicker was the chopped beef and other vegetable ingredients, topped with one olive and fresh dill leaves.  I would definitely get this again.\n\nEven though I was tempted by rabbit stew, various lamb dishes, Goulash, or even Shashlyk, it was the Golubtsy (cabbage roll) that ultimately won.  There were two huge rolls of delicious ground beef and rice, exotically seasoned, topped with a chunky tomato sauce and sour cream, sitting in a well seasoned broth.  Each was quite large, and so I happily saved one for another day.\n\nI had stressed to Mr. B about the reviews that recommended the Beef Stroganoff, and he easily caved.  Bite sized slices of lean beef in a sour cream gravy, it was a surprise to discover it came topped with puff pastry.  It was a showpiece and it was excellent.\n\nOur grand finale was a slice of Napoleon cake,  a multi-layered flaky pastry with whipped cream.  It was simple, but elegant.  With such a filling meal, most of that was relegated to a box to bring home.\n\nThis was a most satisfying meal and a rare find.  I would love to experience this again.

The staff is determined, the food is great and it's only a matter of time until this becomes a destination restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was alive with Russian families celebrating with Baltika, Georgian wine and Borjomi. The food was fresh and well-prepared, featuring items like rabbit and sturgeon. The waiters were literally working up a sweat serving a packed house on Friday night.\n\nStandout dishes include the Russian Bliny Tower, featuring fresh salmon roe, sweet crepes and smoked sturgeon. The rabbit stew has an rich cream sauce and falls off the bone. And I'd recommend two orders of the smoked herring--firm, moist and packed with flavor.\n\nThere are a few areas for improvement. With only two waiters, orders and dishes require patience. The kitchen produces quality food, but it's not quick. We waited about 40 minutes between starters and mains.

Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.  Surprisingly tender and clean tasting.  Great with the red horseradish sauce.\n\n2) Olivie (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1D9HIvwFfzhqMriEvyL_jQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Subtitled \"Russian famous holiday salad\", think potato salad with a mix of ingredients that included eggs, beef, carrots, and green peas.\n\n3) Potato Zrazy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XvN8YhGfuNCpoozcWY2-tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These packets of goodness (filled with meat, think thin skinned piroshky) went well with the sour cream dipping sauce.\n\n4) Mushroom Julienne Cocette (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lEpgeHjdA8GJ289dD5uZiA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Touted by many diners here, probably one of the surprising favorites of everyone at the table. Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.

Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.

There's nothing about any of that which brings me joy or happiness while pretty much every Russian thing I consumed at Red Tavern did just that.  \n\nOur party of 6 dined here in the sleepy Outer Richmond, sating ourselves with too much food and ample good cheer.  This restaurant, with dishes that harken back to a time pre-dating the small-plate craze, is proof that San Francisco is not 100% overpriced food from which you leave hungry.  Perhaps we over-ordered (we did), but I took home leftovers equivalent to an additional two meals.  This is hearty fare.  \n\nIn a perfect world, every meal would begin with a Blini Tower.  For $38.50 (serves 2 - 3), this tower comes with crepes, sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon (wrapped around thinly sliced-lemon), and another wonderful fish.  We shared two towers between 6 people and it was adequate though I'll admit I'd probably be happy with a single platter to myself.  Pure deliciousness.  \n\nA Russian amongst us explained that we must get \"Olivie\" ($8.75), an authentic  concoction akin to both potato salad and egg salad.  Filling and satisfying, I liked that too.\n\nDumplings (Pelmeny) excited me less than Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsy) which were ample in portion and quite good.  Short Rib Beef Stew excited me more than the pastry puff-topped Beef Stroganoff (very good as a leftover) though that enticed me a bit more than the Chicken Shashlik which tasted like a grilled chicken I might make at home.  Even ranking the food in order of like to like-less however, I come away with a single conclusion:  I basically liked it all.\n\nWith a most reasonable $12 corkage fee and hearty entrees running $17 - $22 Red Tavern feels like a bit of a throwback.  The interior is nicer than that of any restaurants in the surrounding blocks (not a high bar to scale) and is comfortable, not fancy.  \n\nWith one exception, I found Red Tavern to be a perfect place for a group gathering as well as a fantastic spot to sate my hunger:  The obvious accompaniment to that Blini Tower is a shot or two of Russian Vodka, not sold here at Red Tavern.  Just as Trump is overlooking the recommendation of additional Russian sanctions, I was able to overlook the missing accompaniment.

Our party of 6 ordered a variety of meals and shared them to get a sample of all the offerings.  I've eaten Russian food before so there were no surprises.  I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.  Very nice.\n\n- Siberian Style Pelmeny: I liked these - though they are usually served with a bowl of vinegar to dip into - the vinegar was missing.  Sofie thought the meat could have been spiced more.\n\n- Short Rib Beef Stew: everyone enjoyed this.  It comes with noodles.  The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.  If \"rustic\" has a taste, this is the wine that would taste \"rustic\".\n\n- Corkage is $12 if you want to bring your own wine.\n\n- Want vodka with your Bliney Tower?  So do I, but they don't have it because they don't have the license to sell hard liquor.\n\nThe Red Tavern was packed out on the Friday evening we were there.  Service was good!  The Red Tavern has an interesting device on the table that we used to get service.  Just press the button and they show up.  The device looks a little cheesy - but it works quite well!

With Kathy A. from the 808 (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OTA-qLc1v4M9hA7rJXiCTQ) and Al L. (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A) (keep writing Al, hopefully you'll get that 2017 badge), you knew Yelp would come up since it was our first common bond in meeting in over a year.  Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.  Surprisingly tender and clean tasting.  Great with the red horseradish sauce.\n\n2) Olivie (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1D9HIvwFfzhqMriEvyL_jQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Subtitled \"Russian famous holiday salad\", think potato salad with a mix of ingredients that included eggs, beef, carrots, and green peas.\n\n3) Potato Zrazy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XvN8YhGfuNCpoozcWY2-tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These packets of goodness (filled with meat, think thin skinned piroshky) went well with the sour cream dipping sauce.\n\n4) Mushroom Julienne Cocette (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lEpgeHjdA8GJ289dD5uZiA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Touted by many diners here, probably one of the surprising favorites of everyone at the table. Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.  A good change of pace from everything else we ordered.\n\n8) Beef Sashlyk with cauliflower (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bR9DnHrEKb-wi_clIJ76EQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and with vegetarian rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ygksNyRu6fKF396Oma9ayw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The beef was unanimously the least favorite entr\u00e9e as it was very plain and lacked character as well as flavor.  Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.  We were glad that they had a  head start on wine and appetizers as we didn't have to wait to chow down.  Walking in, we observed the dining room to be darkly lit but bright lighting under each table, giving an intimate cozy feel.  Seated against the right wall, our party of five was a bit away from the other diners who came and went as we caught up with each other's schedule and plans.  We may have even convinced two non-Yelpers to sign up for accounts... just spreading the word, you know.\nOur waitress did a good job in filling water bottles and removing plates despite being the only person at the front of the house.  The food was a four plus as our gracious host wouldn't allow us to fight for the bill... are you Chinese?!  Big thanks to Kathy for her graciousness and generosity.

I've walked by it many times and was always curious about this restaurant and its cuisine.  Being a newbie to Russian fare, I was looking forward to this dinner.\n\nMike C and I arrived at 6pm and met Kathy A. and her two family members. They were enjoying a nice bottle of red wine and a couple of appetizers, Grilled beef tongue and Olivie, a Russian potato salad. I'm not a beef tongue fan since it's usually tough, but this was nicely grilled and was very tender. It was like a nice cut of steak.\n\nWe checked out the menu and each of us were tasked with choosing a main course. With each entr\u00e9e, you select an accompanying side dish of saut\u00e9ed cabbage, vegetarian rice, grilled cauliflower, buckwheat, mashed potatoes or garlic potatoes.  \n\nBefore our entrees arrived, we indulged on two additional appetizers that we had ordered.  The Mushroom Julienne Cocotte was so delicious. It was a mixture of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled chicken that was baked in a three cheese blend. You spread some on the toasted French baguette and it was wow. I could have eaten the whole order on my own. Potato Zrazy - potato pancakes that were wrapped with sour cream, butter and feta. Different take on potato pancakes.  Very tasty. \n\nBeef Stroganoff with saut\u00e9ed cabbage - a nice presentation ala pot pie. The beef, mushrooms in a cream sauce were in a casserole bowl capped with a golden brown puffed pastry.  Beef and mushroom in a tasty sauce?  Yes, delicious!\n\nAn order of Beef Shashlyk with buckwheat and one with grilled cauliflower. Like the sides here more than the beef.  Beef was cooked well and was on dry side. \n\nPork Loin Schnitzel with mashed potatoes - having had Schnitzel in German restaurants, I was curious how the Russians made it. They used a light bread crumb coating and it was cooked to a golden brown.  Pork was light and tender.\n\nGolubtsy - stuffed cabbage rolls. A unique looking dish.  Stuffed with beef and rice and veggies in a tomato based sauce, it was tasty. \n\nNapoleon Cake, a famous Russian cake with vanilla cr\u00e8me in between layers of flaky pastry.  Delicious. \n\nRussian Syrniki - fried cheesecakes with sour cream and homemade blueberry preserves. \n\nRussian Blinis - crepes served with homemade blueberry preserves and cr\u00e8me fraiche.

There's nothing about any of that which brings me joy or happiness while pretty much every Russian thing I consumed at Red Tavern did just that.  \n\nOur party of 6 dined here in the sleepy Outer Richmond, sating ourselves with too much food and ample good cheer.  This restaurant, with dishes that harken back to a time pre-dating the small-plate craze, is proof that San Francisco is not 100% overpriced food from which you leave hungry.  Perhaps we over-ordered (we did), but I took home leftovers equivalent to an additional two meals.  This is hearty fare.  \n\nIn a perfect world, every meal would begin with a Blini Tower.  For $38.50 (serves 2 - 3), this tower comes with crepes, sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon (wrapped around thinly sliced-lemon), and another wonderful fish.  We shared two towers between 6 people and it was adequate though I'll admit I'd probably be happy with a single platter to myself.  Pure deliciousness.  \n\nA Russian amongst us explained that we must get \"Olivie\" ($8.75), an authentic  concoction akin to both potato salad and egg salad.  Filling and satisfying, I liked that too.\n\nDumplings (Pelmeny) excited me less than Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsy) which were ample in portion and quite good.  Short Rib Beef Stew excited me more than the pastry puff-topped Beef Stroganoff (very good as a leftover) though that enticed me a bit more than the Chicken Shashlik which tasted like a grilled chicken I might make at home.  Even ranking the food in order of like to like-less however, I come away with a single conclusion:  I basically liked it all.\n\nWith a most reasonable $12 corkage fee and hearty entrees running $17 - $22 Red Tavern feels like a bit of a throwback.  The interior is nicer than that of any restaurants in the surrounding blocks (not a high bar to scale) and is comfortable, not fancy.  \n\nWith one exception, I found Red Tavern to be a perfect place for a group gathering as well as a fantastic spot to sate my hunger:  The obvious accompaniment to that Blini Tower is a shot or two of Russian Vodka, not sold here at Red Tavern.  Just as Trump is overlooking the recommendation of additional Russian sanctions, I was able to overlook the missing accompaniment.  And just like that, it didn't make me happy, but life continued.  \n\nRed Tavern is quite good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["- Short Rib Beef Stew: ", "everyone enjoyed this.

I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.

The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.

"], "author": "John G.", "review": "Brought my son here for his graduation dinner because he wanted Russian food and the restaurant near us in Walnut Creek was closed for dinner. I'm very glad they were because I would never have made the trip in to the city otherwise. I was in Kazakhstan for 3 months adopting my son (the one who graduated) and ate out every day at local places throughout the country.  Going to Red Tavern is as close to being back there as I have found anywhere.  I could seriously have been back in Almaty the minute I walked in the place.  For the reviewers upset with the seemingly aloof servers, I must agree with several others in saying that this is just authentically how it would be if you were in Kaz or Russia. We in the US are very used to constant customer service and interaction, but that's just not how it is.  In the words of ex girlfriends everywhere, \"it's not you, it's them.\"\n\nThe Good:  As authentic Russian food as I have found anywhere.  We basically sampled everything that looked good between the 7 of us, so we had a good cross sampling of the bill of fare. Oh and the bread is awesome - great rye bread.  Loved it!\nWe started with the soups, and we really liked all 3 that we had.  The borsch (beet, cabbage, and beef) was a thinner broth style but still had great flavor. The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either. Prices maybe a little high, but not unreasonably so.\n\nOverall:  I have to agree that this may be the best Russian food I've had in the US. Very quaint d\u00e9cor.  Felt like I was back in Kazakhstan.

No offense to the Olgas out there. \n\nThat was my only experience with Russian culture (not really an \"experience\" though), other than eating Pirozhkis at my high school beanery. Talk about needing to be cultured. \n\nEnter Red Tavern. \n\nQuietly opening in July 2011, Red Tavern took over Sadko which was also a Russian restaurant in San Francisco's Little Russia area (Outer Richmond). Finding street parking is a biatch in the area but there's a parking lot across Red Tavern that charges $3 for every 30 minutes. \n\nCombing through all the reviews, I was a bit scared before coming to Red Tavern. One star reviews mentioned being yelled at and being refused service. None of my Yelp friends had reviewed the place which made me even warier. I don't doubt the one star reviews. Service was as scary (in the beginning) as when I did something naughty as a child and had to face the wrath of my Chinese pitbull mom. *Hides in the corner* There's only one waiter and he is cold and brusque as can be which means I had to be on my very best behavior aka NO alkie for Cherylynn. BOO! At the end, he did warm up when I tried to make small talk with him so it's really just a cultural thing so don't take offense (just like rude service at Chinese restaurants). \n\nDo note that service is S-L-O-W.

The pancakes could have been crisper but they were delicious nonetheless with the silky smooth smoked salmon, \"salsa\", and creamy sour cream. As one of my favorite offal meats, our second appetizer of Grilled Beef Tongue w/ Creamy Horseradish Sauce ($9.50) didn't disappoint http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#3u3VcwzRs6vvTooH2p4YFg . The tongue was so soft and tender with a slight bite to it. The grill marks added a lovely smoky nuance.

"], "author": "John G.", "review": "Brought my son here for his graduation dinner because he wanted Russian food and the restaurant near us in Walnut Creek was closed for dinner. I'm very glad they were because I would never have made the trip in to the city otherwise. I was in Kazakhstan for 3 months adopting my son (the one who graduated) and ate out every day at local places throughout the country.  Going to Red Tavern is as close to being back there as I have found anywhere.  I could seriously have been back in Almaty the minute I walked in the place.  For the reviewers upset with the seemingly aloof servers, I must agree with several others in saying that this is just authentically how it would be if you were in Kaz or Russia. We in the US are very used to constant customer service and interaction, but that's just not how it is.  In the words of ex girlfriends everywhere, \"it's not you, it's them.\"\n\nThe Good:  As authentic Russian food as I have found anywhere.  We basically sampled everything that looked good between the 7 of us, so we had a good cross sampling of the bill of fare. Oh and the bread is awesome - great rye bread.  Loved it!\nWe started with the soups, and we really liked all 3 that we had.  The borsch (beet, cabbage, and beef) was a thinner broth style but still had great flavor. The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either. Prices maybe a little high, but not unreasonably so.\n\nOverall:  I have to agree that this may be the best Russian food I've had in the US. Very quaint d\u00e9cor.

I've walked by it many times and was always curious about this restaurant and its cuisine.  Being a newbie to Russian fare, I was looking forward to this dinner.\n\nMike C and I arrived at 6pm and met Kathy A. and her two family members. They were enjoying a nice bottle of red wine and a couple of appetizers, Grilled beef tongue and Olivie, a Russian potato salad. I'm not a beef tongue fan since it's usually tough, but this was nicely grilled and was very tender. It was like a nice cut of steak.\n\nWe checked out the menu and each of us were tasked with choosing a main course. With each entr\u00e9e, you select an accompanying side dish of saut\u00e9ed cabbage, vegetarian rice, grilled cauliflower, buckwheat, mashed potatoes or garlic potatoes.  \n\nBefore our entrees arrived, we indulged on two additional appetizers that we had ordered.  The Mushroom Julienne Cocotte was so delicious. It was a mixture of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled chicken that was baked in a three cheese blend. You spread some on the toasted French baguette and it was wow. I could have eaten the whole order on my own. Potato Zrazy - potato pancakes that were wrapped with sour cream, butter and feta. Different take on potato pancakes.  Very tasty. \n\nBeef Stroganoff with saut\u00e9ed cabbage - a nice presentation ala pot pie. The beef, mushrooms in a cream sauce were in a casserole bowl capped with a golden brown puffed pastry.  Beef and mushroom in a tasty sauce?  Yes, delicious!\n\nAn order of Beef Shashlyk with buckwheat and one with grilled cauliflower. Like the sides here more than the beef.  Beef was cooked well and was on dry side. \n\nPork Loin Schnitzel with mashed potatoes - having had Schnitzel in German restaurants, I was curious how the Russians made it. They used a light bread crumb coating and it was cooked to a golden brown.  Pork was light and tender.\n\nGolubtsy - stuffed cabbage rolls. A unique looking dish.  Stuffed with beef and rice and veggies in a tomato based sauce, it was tasty. \n\nNapoleon Cake, a famous Russian cake with vanilla cr\u00e8me in between layers of flaky pastry.  Delicious. \n\nRussian Syrniki - fried cheesecakes with sour cream and homemade blueberry preserves. \n\nRussian Blinis - crepes served with homemade blueberry preserves and cr\u00e8me fraiche. Light and tasty. \n\nWhat a dining experience!  Getting to finally enjoy Russian cuisine at Red Tavern courtesy of Kathy A, who also gave us nice stories of her Russian heritage.

The beef, mushrooms in a cream sauce were in a casserole bowl capped with a golden brown puffed pastry.  Beef and mushroom in a tasty sauce?  Yes, delicious!\n\nAn order of Beef Shashlyk with buckwheat and one with grilled cauliflower. Like the sides here more than the beef.  Beef was cooked well and was on dry side. \n\nPork Loin Schnitzel with mashed potatoes - having had Schnitzel in German restaurants, I was curious how the Russians made it. They used a light bread crumb coating and it was cooked to a golden brown.  Pork was light and tender.\n\nGolubtsy - stuffed cabbage rolls. A unique looking dish.  Stuffed with beef and rice and veggies in a tomato based sauce, it was tasty. \n\nNapoleon Cake, a famous Russian cake with vanilla cr\u00e8me in between layers of flaky pastry.

", "It was simple, but elegant.  "], "author": "Wendy B.", "review": "The old, ethnic neighborhoods of SF are no more, even Chinatown is diverse.  We were told there is no such thing as a Russian sector like we remembered, and it is just as hard to find a real Russian restaurant.   Our attempt to visit a unique one in Jenner, Russian House #1, had failed this trip.  A matter of bad timing and loosely structured hours of operation.  But I do not accept failure easily, so I turned to the advice of a dear Russian lady and friend who gave us one name, Red Tavern.  \n\nIn typical SF fashion, we found Red Tavern snugly wedged between other tiny neighborhood businesses.  None were Russian, but rather Mexican, Chinese, Italian, and who knows what else.  I was totally not prepared for the elegant interior with white tablecloths, red cloth napkins, sparkling wine glasses at each table setting, deep red and gold walls with dark mahogany wood.  The real shocker was, there were two very large parties taking up most of the tiny restaurant and one smaller party of 7.  Humbled, I had forgotten to call for reservations.  Thankfully, the wait was minimal, perhaps 20 minutes.  We got lucky and got the sole table unreserved.\n\nThe menu consisted of a one-page listing that even included their beverages.  \n\nFirst came our bowl of Borscht.  I expected something different, more beet and beef tasting, less cabbage and too light a broth for my expectations, but it had an intensely beautiful color.  A plate of their almost cake-like, dark Russian Rye and butter was a big hit and complimented the soup.\n\nSecondly, came the Olivie Salad.  So glad we tried it.  This was basically a Russian potato salad, but the kicker was the chopped beef and other vegetable ingredients, topped with one olive and fresh dill leaves.  I would definitely get this again.\n\nEven though I was tempted by rabbit stew, various lamb dishes, Goulash, or even Shashlyk, it was the Golubtsy (cabbage roll) that ultimately won.  There were two huge rolls of delicious ground beef and rice, exotically seasoned, topped with a chunky tomato sauce and sour cream, sitting in a well seasoned broth.  Each was quite large, and so I happily saved one for another day.\n\nI had stressed to Mr. B about the reviews that recommended the Beef Stroganoff, and he easily caved.  Bite sized slices of lean beef in a sour cream gravy, it was a surprise to discover it came topped with puff pastry.  It was a showpiece and it was excellent.\n\nOur grand finale was a slice of Napoleon cake,  a multi-layered flaky pastry with whipped cream.  It was simple, but elegant.  With such a filling meal, most of that was relegated to a box to bring home.\n\nThis was a most satisfying meal and a rare find.  I would love to experience this again. Worthy of a strong 4.5 rating.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-09-11"}, {"excerpts": ["We had potato zrazy, Julienne cocote, beef stroganoff, Chilean sea bass, then syrniki and Napoleon cake for dessert and ", "everything was beyond delicious!

"], "author": "John G.", "review": "Brought my son here for his graduation dinner because he wanted Russian food and the restaurant near us in Walnut Creek was closed for dinner. I'm very glad they were because I would never have made the trip in to the city otherwise. I was in Kazakhstan for 3 months adopting my son (the one who graduated) and ate out every day at local places throughout the country.  Going to Red Tavern is as close to being back there as I have found anywhere.  I could seriously have been back in Almaty the minute I walked in the place.  For the reviewers upset with the seemingly aloof servers, I must agree with several others in saying that this is just authentically how it would be if you were in Kaz or Russia. We in the US are very used to constant customer service and interaction, but that's just not how it is.  In the words of ex girlfriends everywhere, \"it's not you, it's them.\"\n\nThe Good:  As authentic Russian food as I have found anywhere.  We basically sampled everything that looked good between the 7 of us, so we had a good cross sampling of the bill of fare. Oh and the bread is awesome - great rye bread.  Loved it!\nWe started with the soups, and we really liked all 3 that we had.  The borsch (beet, cabbage, and beef) was a thinner broth style but still had great flavor. The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either. Prices maybe a little high, but not unreasonably so.\n\nOverall:  I have to agree that this may be the best Russian food I've had in the US. Very quaint d\u00e9cor.  Felt like I was back in Kazakhstan.

With Kathy A. from the 808 (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OTA-qLc1v4M9hA7rJXiCTQ) and Al L. (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A) (keep writing Al, hopefully you'll get that 2017 badge), you knew Yelp would come up since it was our first common bond in meeting in over a year.  Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.  Surprisingly tender and clean tasting.  Great with the red horseradish sauce.\n\n2) Olivie (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1D9HIvwFfzhqMriEvyL_jQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Subtitled \"Russian famous holiday salad\", think potato salad with a mix of ingredients that included eggs, beef, carrots, and green peas.\n\n3) Potato Zrazy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XvN8YhGfuNCpoozcWY2-tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These packets of goodness (filled with meat, think thin skinned piroshky) went well with the sour cream dipping sauce.\n\n4) Mushroom Julienne Cocette (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lEpgeHjdA8GJ289dD5uZiA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Touted by many diners here, probably one of the surprising favorites of everyone at the table. Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.  A good change of pace from everything else we ordered.\n\n8) Beef Sashlyk with cauliflower (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bR9DnHrEKb-wi_clIJ76EQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and with vegetarian rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ygksNyRu6fKF396Oma9ayw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The beef was unanimously the least favorite entr\u00e9e as it was very plain and lacked character as well as flavor.  Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.  We were glad that they had a  head start on wine and appetizers as we didn't have to wait to chow down.  Walking in, we observed the dining room to be darkly lit but bright lighting under each table, giving an intimate cozy feel.  Seated against the right wall, our party of five was a bit away from the other diners who came and went as we caught up with each other's schedule and plans.  We may have even convinced two non-Yelpers to sign up for accounts... just spreading the word, you know.\nOur waitress did a good job in filling water bottles and removing plates despite being the only person at the front of the house.  The food was a four plus as our gracious host wouldn't allow us to fight for the bill... are you Chinese?!  Big thanks to Kathy for her graciousness and generosity.
