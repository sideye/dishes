So my sister had a brilliant idea (not being sarcastic) to do a self-directed foodie tour of a nearby neighborhood on foot, since there was like a string of eateries up and down the street.  So she wanted to start at Phillies, which she already knew and loved, but wanted to share with me, a San Diegan, not a San Franciscan.  So, here's my past experience with cheesesteaks: someone says, let's get cheesesteaks, my mouth waters even though I'm thinking, oh crap, the calories!, but then because my mouth is watering, I go with the person to get the cheesesteak, eat the cheesesteak, but then feel like a lingering regret for eating the cheesesteak, since it tasted much better in my mind than what I actually had.  (And, yeah, I've never had a real Philly cheesesteak to compare anything to).\n\nAnyway, not wanting to be a killjoy and because I had the automatic salivatory response anyway even after all my past experiences (and because I knew my boyfriend would really want to go), we went to Phillies.  My sister asked them to slice the cheesesteaks into 3 separate pieces (we were on a self-guided food tour, so had to keep room available for other stuff).  We tried the Works, and man, this is the first time I can say that the cheesesteak lived up to what my taste buds imagined a cheesesteak could be and should be.  The meat was just so flavorful and everything else inside of the c.s. was like, complementing it and not overwhelming, all working together to create total cheesesteak yumminess-perfection.\n\nBut, anyway...we were attempted to just order more cheesesteaks and stop right there, because we all agreed, it was goood!  but we were on a mission, and we had to complete it...next stop, Batter Up, a corn dog joint right down the street...on we went, despite a strong temptation to just go all out at Phillies.\n\nReally good cheesesteaks! \n\n(Ambience= extremely casual.

(And, yeah, I've never had a real Philly cheesesteak to compare anything to).\n\nAnyway, not wanting to be a killjoy and because I had the automatic salivatory response anyway even after all my past experiences (and because I knew my boyfriend would really want to go), we went to Phillies.  My sister asked them to slice the cheesesteaks into 3 separate pieces (we were on a self-guided food tour, so had to keep room available for other stuff).  We tried the Works, and man, this is the first time I can say that the cheesesteak lived up to what my taste buds imagined a cheesesteak could be and should be.

Phillies Cheesesteaks is awesome and I like my first time experience here so much. I got off the 43 at the bus stop right in front, the Taqueria La Iguana Azul adjacent to this place really caught my attention well. I was very hungry so came in and ordered Cheese Tots which was delicious.\n\nThe staff members here are very nice, the restaurant itself is a bit small but the portions for the food were very generous. Also, I noticed this green score card from the Department of Public Health they have posted on the window from the inside. The Inspection Score is 100, so this means the staff who runs this place took the overall cleaniness of the restaurant very seriously.\n\nHere some of the menu items they have:\n- Plain French Fries\n- Cheese Fries\n- Chili Cheese Fries\n- Plain Tater Tots\n- Cheese Tots\n- Chili Cheese Tots\n\nParking: Mostly Street Metered Parking\n\nI do like that this restaurant is around 10-20 minutes from City College of San Francisco Main Campus.\n\nPublic Transit: MUNI Routes 8X Bayshore Express, 8BX Bayshore B Express, 43 Masonic & 54 Felton\n\nOther Nearby MUNI Routes: 14 Mission, 14L Mission Limited, 14X Mission Express & 29 Sunset", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-07-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Staff are really nice and be sure to order some Wiggy fries or some chili cheese tots while you are at it."], "author": "Leon L.", "review": "This place is the bomb...

(Spits) Phillies like the liberty bell is CRACKIN'! It's rocks like Rocky. It's fly like the Eagles. It's always Sunny and hell Phil's shows brotherly love, champ. This is the biggest thing to come from Philly to out here in the Bay Area since Wilt Chamberlain. \n\nFormerly 'Starvin' Marvin' this place made it's own place, it's grew into a great place. All about the Benjamins now, baby!!! While it's very successful, it has it's roots in good customer service and great food.\n\nYou know you're from Philly, when you can't eat anything without it wrap in a Amoroso Roll. Well, no worries Phillies here in Crocker is the place to be if homesick. Their steaks are 100% top loin. Chicken is 100% breast meat.  1/2 pound of meat in every roll. They import their Amoroso Roll from Philly.  \n\nYou can get Steak or Chicken wit or wit-out Onions. (6.50 to 6.75). You can get Pepper Steak with Bell Peppers, Pizza Steak, Steak Hoagie, or Veggie, but IMO, the Cheese Steak with Cheese Whiz and Mushroom Steak are the best!!! 'supposely' veggie are cooked on a seperate grill, but I been here so many times to know that's only half true. Warning: sandwiches are hot like burning hot like the 76ers when they were really hot back in the day. The peppers are hot for another reason, it's spicy!!! AHHHH!!!!! My mouth is burning! Excuse me, I just ate a pepper! \n\nU can add these sauces to your hoagie for 50 cents: cheese, BBQ, Buffalo, Pizza, Avocado, Mushroom, Peppers. \n\nBreakfast Philly are serve: egg, steak and cheese for 6.50 and tater tots for 2.50.\n\nPhilly Salad: (don't get, be a man and get a cheesesteak, please). 5.99. It's like going to a steak house and ordering salad. Who does that???! WAWA! \n\nSides: Fries (2.50). Chilli (3.00) Fried Zucchini Bread (2.50) Breaded Mushroom (2.50) and Soda (1.50).\n\nThe best day to go is Thursday as they have a special: Philly, fries, and soda for $10. \n\nYou can dine in, but it's kinda small quarters and the stools are bit wobbly at times. You can watch television while you eat, and near it is the sauce station, and fountain machine. Free refills on fountain drinks. There is candy on the counter, don't remember if it's free or not, never got to ask. Always forgetting to ask.   \n\nOverall: good sandwiches, good customer service, dine in location so-so. \n\nThey do need a couple of things to add to the menu, one day like Scrapple and Wooder ice! Make it made!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-10-14"}]}
