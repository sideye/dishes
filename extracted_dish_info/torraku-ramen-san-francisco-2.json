Thinking that it wouldn't be crowded on a weekday and parking would be a breeze, I drove down there. When I arrived, there was zero parking. Apparently, people that work in the area park in the area all day since there's a lot of non-metered parking. After circling 5-6 times, I stalked this guy who left the food park. Yes - rock star parking in front! He took what seems like eternity adjusting his mirrors before finally putting his seat belt on. He turns on his car, turns it off, gets out of the car and walks across the street. The inconsiderate phucktard could of told me he was NOT leaving when he initially got into his car since he saw me waiting for his space. *shakes fist* \n\nAfter circling another 4 rounds, I found metered parking around the block. I stepped out of the car and onto fresh, dinosaur-size turds. Lovely. \n\nAs I was waiting in line to place my order at Torraku Ramen, Tater Tot decided to lay down in a puddle of water. Brown, muddy water at that. \n\nSometimes you have to laugh this sh*t off. Literally.\n\nTorraku Ramen serves up 6 kinds of ramen: Seafood, Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Miso, Curry, and Veggie. They're all $12 a bowl except for the seafood ramen ($13). For the tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and curry ramen, you have a choice of Kakuni (pork belly) or Chashu (pork shoulder). You have an option to add garlic and choose your level of spiciness. Except for the seafood ramen, all bowls come with half an ajitsuke tamago, bamboo shoots, wood ear mushrooms, pickled ginger, scallions, and nori. Extra toppings (corn, cabbage, bamboo, bean sprouts) are an additional $1. NO msg is used which is a huge plus! You can order to go for an extra 10 cents (also offers delivery through GrubHub). IMO, just like a Neapolitan pizza, you shouldn't order ramen to go; the quality will not be the same as if you eat it on the spot.  \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen w/ kakuni, wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots, ajitsuke tamago, nori, medium spicy ($12). I also added black garlic ($1) and corn ($1): http://bit.ly/1nzVdoz. With a bottle of water (Voss only) and tip, my total was over $21; kinda pricey. \n\nMy order was ready in about 5 minutes and was piping hot. Everything was on-point except the broth. I highly suggest ordering the ramen \"no spicy\" because the chili oil was so overpowering that you couldn't taste the rich milkiness of the tonkotsu broth (if there was any). All I tasted was oil so I didn't drink much of the broth. The noodles were al-dente and springy with a good chew. The kakuni had a higher fat ratio to meat then I would have preferred but it was flavorful and tender. The highlight was the ajitsuke tamago, marinated soft boiled egg. The soy marinade produced a savory sweetness and the egg had a beautiful molten center. The portion was filling. I'm very intolerant to msg and had zero issues afterwards - so they really don't use it. \n\nAs I was slurping my ramen, a guy sat next to me with his order from Bacon Bacon. We said, hi to each other and he started taking obligatory food pics. I was always taught not to stare but I couldn't stop staring at him from the corner of my eye...\n\nHe was videotaping himself eating his burger and fries with commentary and all. Is this some new trend that I'm not aware of?\n\nP.S. - If said guy is reading this, I think you and my gf would totally hit it off! =)", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-10"}, {"excerpts": ["My absolute favorite is the vegan curry ramen, it is PHENOMENAL!!!
