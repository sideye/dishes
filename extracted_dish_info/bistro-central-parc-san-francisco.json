More visually appealing than the actual taste. The salad had a weird dressing on it and the beef also had a similar dressing, with a sour tinge. The salad and beef definitely taste better separately. Just personally wasn't one of my favorites. \n\n- Curry mussels: 3/5 couldn't really taste the curry flavor and the broth was too creamy and weighed down the flavor of the mussels. It may be just personal taste, but I enjoy my mussels to be a little lighter tasting. \n\n- French fries: can't even give this thing a score. They were just French fries. The guy really sold us on it, saying we should dip the fries into the mussel broth for an amazing experience but it was honestly just a \"meh\" combination. Didn't add much to the fries and the mussel broth couldn't sufficiently cling onto the fries. Would pass on this for sure. Totally overpriced at $7/serving \n\n- Rossini: filet mignon, foie gras, potato. 4.5/5 Very good but very rich. So rich that I wasn't sure if we could finish it. All together, a good flavor combination. \n\n- Beef cheek: 5/5 favorite dish. The beef cheek is fork tender and delicious with the underlying beet pur\u00e9e. Little stumps of potatoes that cake with it also very tasty. The cheek, the mushrooms, and the beet sauce really work well together, to create a tasty complete bite. \n\n- service: 1 person seating people and 1 waiter. Not enough man power and therefore, things were missed. For example, water not refilled, the fries not delivered until we asked for them. Took a while to get the check. Etc. But overall, acceptable and no significant problems since the staff was nice when they did come by. \n\nOverall, this restaurant had French food with a little more flavor than usual (everything was a bit more sour than usual-- but not necessarily in a bad way).

As I cut into the foie gras and filet, I saw the juices from the foie gras dribble down onto the tender slice of filet. As I put the fork of this perfect union in my mouth, it was love at first bite. The filet was soft and tender, and the foie gras added that layer of fatty decadence to take it over the top.

I took my family and Matt T. here on Christmas Eve night to get our French on.  Everything was delicious but I hate to say it.  \"It ain't no Chapeau!\"  You can't help but compare after having one of the best French meals in SF.  They were close though, I give Central Parc Bistro 4.5 stars. \n\nThey give complimentary bread but it wasn't warm or toasted. \n\nHighlights for appetizers: \n\nThe traditional French onion soup ($8.50) hit the spot real good.  It came out steaming with perfectly baked cheese on top and warm, ooey, gooey cheese with onions inside.  It's just a bowl of happiness in my opinion.  I really hate to compare it to Chapeau! but one thing Bistro Central Parc was missing was some good crunchy pieces of bread in the soup. Le sigh. \n\nThe mussels au curry madras ($12.50) had white wine, shallots, parsley, curry madras, and cr\u00e8me fraiche.  The steamed mussels were drenched in a very creamy and delicious sauce.  I would use my spoon to drink it while I slurp up the mussel meat!  I recommend you dip the complimentary bread in the soup base.  Beware, the white wine is a little strong so you may get a nice light buzz off of it.\n\nPommes frites ($5) were solid. They tasted really fresh and crisp. Great to go with an entr\u00e9e.  \n\nThe warm brie on potato pancake with mizuna salad ($9.50) was good but not outstanding.  The salad gave it a more asian fusion taste.  The sweetbread with mushrooms ($10)  was an interesting dish but not memorable to my taste buds.\n\nOnto the main course!\n\nI was so happy that they were doing specials off the menu for the Tournedos Rossini ($28).  It was everything I could ask for in a French meal: filet mignon with foie gras.   The presentation was fierce since it was literally a tower of goods.  The filet mignon was toppled on top of fried potatoes along with the foie gras in this amazing black truffle sauce. The filet mignon was black pepper galore and I loved it.  I had it medium and it was done to pink perfection.  The foie gras was...different.  It was served more lukewarm and had a different texture to it.  It didn't have the crunchy texture but it melted in my mouth.\n\nI tried the beef bourguignon ($18 and it was my second favorite dish.  It was drenched in a rosemary-red wine sauce and seasonal vegetables.  The meat was cooked oh so tender, I barely had to chew.  The sauce is a tad bit salty but it went great with the vegetables and you can taste a little wine in it.  They are fearless with their wine in the dishes!  \n\nThe Risotto with seared scallops in lobster sauce ($18) was delicious but something I wouldn't order again.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and they were good sized.  However, the risotto could definitely use a little more flavor.  However, I'm sure my taste buds were immune to salt after having heavy beef dishes.  The risotto had a great creamy texture to it as well.  Other main courses were the fish of the day and the lamb both looked delicious but I didn't get to try.\n\nDesserts:\nThe creme brulee ($7.50) and the pyramide de chocolate ($9) were my favorites.  Creme brulee had a nice crispy sugar coated on top of the rich cream underneath.  The pyramide had a really rich and fluffy chocolate cream with the cake.  We also had two Buche de Noel: one chocolate and one caramel ($9 each).  This dessert was like a spiral sponge cake with caramel or chocoalte inside.  It reminded me of the chinese round sponge cake so it wasn't anything special.  I hope they vary up their desserts next time!\n\nOverall, still a solid experience.

Typically the texture of beef tartar is quite gooey after you mix the meat with the egg yolk (which I do not care for) but surprisingly this wasn't the case.

Can't really compare the two -- I've never been to Chapeau! -- but I'm not at all disappointed I decided to try this place out.\n\nFOOD:  The food here is fantastic for the price.  We got to try the following:  \n\nPotato pancake with brie and mizuna salad ($9.50):  Surprisingly tasty alternative to the mussels, which weren't available the day we went.  Pancake itself was perfectly fried and crisp, albeit a bit dry when eaten alone.  The melted brie helped lubricate the whole shootin' match.  Mizuna was rock-star (did I just call salad greens rock-star???  I think I did ...) when paired with a deliciously light and refreshing raspberry vinaigrette.   \n\nDuck breast with mushrooms, bacon, potatoes and spinach in a cherry sauce ($19.50):  Amazing as well.  Didn't show up on the online menu.  Prepared just as requested -- medium rare.  The meat itself was a bit on the chewy side, but I don't begrudge Bistro CP for what was otherwise a very tasty protein in a wonderful sauce, with savory accompaniments.  \n\nRisotto with scallops and lobster sauce ($19.50): Not sure I tasted the lobster in the sauce, but risotto was still quite tasty -- very creamy and al dente.  Scallops prepared perfectly -- deeply seared on the outside, while just cooked through on the inside.  Not rubbery and overcooked, as scallops easily can be. \n\nRatatouille ($5):  Comes with eggplant, zucchini, red bell pepper, onions, and tomatoes.  Standard, but provided good balance to the rich entrees.  Bistro CP has affordable sides, generally speaking -- and they're cheaper than getting a second appetizer.\n\nWe were really full after the entrees, and decided not to opt for desserts.  Pretty standard fare, though -- I recall seeing profiteroles, creme brulee, poached pears, chocolate cake, and apple tarte tatin as choices.\n\nBread was served warm, but was in my opinion too hard on the outside.  I felt like a mole rat digging my way through the crust just to get to the good, soft part.\n\nSERVICE/AMBIANCE:  Service was generally good, and the owner personally checked in at our table, which was appreciated (but not really necessary).  Waiter was attentive, but not overbearing, though he could have been friendlier (though that might have been asking too much of the Frenchman).  The space is narrow, and as a result the restaurant gets a bit noisy when it is packed (which it seems to be during most of its open hours).   Some menu items were out, which is unfortunate.  Call if you really want something in particular to make sure they have it.\n\nPARKING:  Parking, as others have noted, is painful.  I parked at the garage for Lucky (2 free hours) on Fulton and would suggest others do the same.  Yes, risk the ticket or buy a pack of gum from Lucky to assuage your guilt.\n\nFINAL NOTES:  As noted above, I haven't been to Chapeau! and can't compare the quality of that experience.  But I'll offer a few quick observations, namely that Bistro CP seems to hew more closely to the tried and true, while Chapeau! offers more interesting ingredients and innovative combinations (e.g., Skate Wing, Basil Napoleon).  On the other hand, Bistro CP is cheaper -- my friend and I escaped with a bill of $80, which included the food, tax, tip, and a glass of wine.  I don't think you can get that kind of value anywhere else in the city.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Sweet Bread with Mushrooms, French Onion Soup, Special Fillet, Scallops Risotto, a side of Frites, and great wines.

(meaning that I didn't have to pay for my meal). \n\nThe location is very narrow with plenty of natural light streaming in from side and front windows.  If you blink, you would miss it, as it blends into the neighborhood and the front of the restaurant appears almost like a house/apt building entrance way.\n\nWe were seated immediately.  Service was friendly.  The menu consisted of select choices of  classical French Bistro fare.  In addition to the menu, there were choices of specialties and of course, a list of WINE.\n\nMembers of my party ordered the following appetizers:\nThe food was good, classical French Bistro fare.  \nbaked cod\nendive salad\nwild mushroom risotto with truffle oil\n\nOut of the 3, the mushroom risotto was my clear favorite.  Luckily, one of the diners in my group had been here before and did request the risotto be cooked more, so that it would arrive LESS al dente.  Even with that, the risotto was quite firm, but the mushrooms and the truffle oil imparted such a lovely, strong, pleasant flavor, that I have to recommend it. \n\nThe baked cod, on the other hand, was just curious. I believe that it was mixed with mashed potato (potato puree), and sprinkled with bread crumbs.  Yet, it really lacked flavor, but the  consistency made it interesting enough for me to continue trying to pull out some thought about whether I liked it or not.  In the end, I'm still left up in the air.  It felt like it was missing a key flavor ingredient.  The fishy aftertaste could have used something to offset it.\n\nThe endive salad with raspberry dressing, pear and Roquefort cheese was light and refreshing, while the cheese imparted a strong pungency.\n\nOne of the diners in my party ordered the mussels in garlic, butter and white wine sauce.  He said that it was ok.  Unfortunately, my lesson learned from other shellfish experiences is that I'm allergic.  So, I can have no shellfish.\n\nI also tried a bite of the lamb shank, which was tender and the sauce was not overpowering, but complimented the meat quite well..\n\nYet, my dish, the beef bourguignon was presented in a very different way.  It was a small portion served over potato puree.  The presentation was quite like a mini volcano with a ring of mashed potato around a mountain of stewed beef.  The flavor was slightly salty, but the beef was so tender that no knife was necessary (even though, I did use my knife before I realized this).\n\nThe highlight of the meal for me:  the profiteroles dessert and the kir royal.  I'm all about the carbs...\n\nThree mini puff pastries sandwhiching little balls of ice cream and drenched in HOT chocolatesyrup.  *sigh*...  It was just the right portion size to make me comfortably full.\n\nMy friends had ordered the vanilla creme brulee.  The caramelized sugar topping was just the right consistency to get the desired \"crackle\" sound when you tap it lightly with a spoon (yes, I listen to it) and the custard was smooth.  Overall, not bad flavor.  Not the best that I've had, but definitely not the worst.\n\nFor 4 people, the bill came to ~$150 - ish for 3 apps, 4 entrees, 2 desserts and 2 glasses of wine (incl. tip, sans tax)\n\nAll in all, a solid meal.  Not the best French meal that I've had in the city and definitely not the worst.

I've always heard great things about this place and I knew that it was eventually gonna be on our list of \"places to eat while in SF\".\n\nParking was tricky. We circled about 10-15 minutes around the surrounding areas and because it was located in a, mainly residential, area, we had to park on the main artery, Masonic, running through that part of NOPA.\n\nWalking in, we expected a French bistro vibe (hence the name), but we got more of a modern San Francisco modern restaurant vibe. When we think of french bistro, the memory of eating at NYC's Pastis always comes to mind. We arrived nearly an hour early of our 830pm reservations but were promptly seated at the bar. I was disappointed, at first, but once the first course meals started arriving, I forgot all about it.\n\nThe bartender, who had an awesome French accent, was very knowledgeable in the menu items. For hour`derves, we opted for the sweetbread with wild mushrooms and french onion soup, which both were exquisite, especially the sweetbread. I'm not usually a fan of organ meats, but the blend of mushrooms and the accompanying port sauce with the actual meat made it for a delicious first course. \n\nMain dishes included the seared scallops atop lobster risotto, which, by far, was the most amazing risotto I had tasted in San Francisco. Something about the balanced creaminess with the soft texture of the scallops, my partner also was amazed at how rich and flavor full it was. My BF ordered the fish of the day: halibut with sliced potatoes. His first reaction after biting into the potatoes, \"this has got to be the best tasting potatoes I have ever eaten.\" Not that we're huge on throwing those heavy terms like \"best\" and \"ever\" around, but our experience here definitely deserved those descriptions. \n\nVolcan au chocolate was our choice of dessert. The presentation was equally as impressive as the taste. Chocolate syrup designs, filled in with color, was used to create an intricate artwork that likened to a glass mosaic that you'd find in a cathedral. The cake was soft on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. Perfect ending to a great culinary adventure. \n\nIt came out to about $91 total for 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert. This restaurant's food quality compares to another affordable SF French restaurant, Chapeu, and lives up to it's name of being a true bistro with excellent food and awesome service.

However, the individual mussels were very small and lacked good seafood flavor. Could benefit from finding another supplier. 3.5 stars due to great sauce.\n* Mussels in white wine/curry sauce - same as above. The delicious sauce saved the dish. 4 stars. \n\nMain Courses:\n* 3 Daily Specials: Tournedos Rossini (which is a beautiful filet mignon topped with foie gras and fried fingerling potatoes...this tower of flavor sitting on top of a potato pancake and surrounded by a peppery reduction). All 3 orders were ordered rare and they came out perfectly. This meal was divine and very rich/filling. $28 but worth it and would recommend it to carnivores. 5 stars.\n* Duck Breast: Slices of medium rare duck breast on top of seasonal vegetables in an incredible reduction sauce.

As it was cold on Xmas Eve, many customers waited inside while their tables were being prepared. This caused congestion in the front and encroached on the guests sitting near the front. Also, the temperature in the restaurant was too warm...around 75 degrees. This was probably due to the thermostat turned too high, the large amount of customers, and the proximity of the open kitchen. \n\nOverall (even with the long wait and hot temperature): This place is a total winner and will become part of our short list of places to bring friends for an initmate, delicious, and authentic dining experience.

Let's just say French food isn't a frequent visitor to the palate of our family (primarily because none of us have been exposed to it), but it was a delight to try something new.\n\nWe made reservations for 6pm on a Friday evening and it was pretty quiet when we arrived. We were promptly acknowledged and seated when we were asked if we preferred a bottle of still or sparkling water. We asked for sparkling -- little did we realize at the time until glancing at the menu that it was a $7 decision -- no matter it was a family dinner after all.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Escargots bourguignon (garlic and parsley butter $10): It was the first time for my little brother and I trying escargot. For 6 pieces, it was just okay. It honestly tasted like chewy pesto. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't too memorable either.\n- Moules marinieres (Mussels , white wine, shallots , parsley, cream. $12.50) YOU. MUST. HAVE. THESE. Honestly it was probably the highlight of the entire meal. The broth is absolutely fantastic, and as others noted, you must ask for more bread to soak up the goodness. They were a bit small, but BCP makes up in volume. I counted 27/28 shells for the order. In terms of value, the mussels couldn't be beat.\n- Pommes frites (french fries $5): The waitress recommended this to soak up the Mussel broth. Yum.\n\nENTREES:\n- Risotto aux coquilles St Jacques (Risotto, lobster sauce, scallops $22): Very generous with the scallops. Probably tied for the best scallops I've ever had in my life. Perfectly cooked. The risotto was just okay by itself, but with the scallops they were the perfect combination! I had the best entree. :)\n- Carr\u00e9 d'agneau, ratatouille (Rack of lamb with rosemary fleur de sel \n and ratatouille $24): Little brother and mom both had the rack of lamb. I guess you could use the term \"rack\"  loosely, because it was two pieces (albeit perfectly cooked medium rare) Neither of them were too fond of the ratatouille. Too much tomato in their opinion.\n- Filet mignon (green peppercorn sauce, Potato gratin $24): The older brother and dad ordered meat (of course). My dad's came cooked perfectly at medium rare. On the other hand my brother's was a bit underdone. He asked for medium rare and it was definitely too rare for him. We sent it back to have it re-fired. Unfortunately it came back still underdone. My brother was hungry, so he dug in anyways. He'd eaten about 2/3 of it when the owner came back to check on the meat. Unfortunately we showed him it was still undercooked, but it was fine since he'd eaten 2/3 of it. He took the plate without a word and walked back towards the kitchen. Uh-oh, hopefully we didn't get the cook in trouble. :( The owner brought back the thrice-fired fillet (with a new potato gratin) replated. I guess third times the charm because it was (finally) medium rare.\n\nDESSERT:\n- Creme Brulee ($7.50): Definitely in my top 3 creme brulees I've ever had and it was a perfect size for sharing.\n\nOur server was very apologetic about the filet mignon ordeal that she comped one of the orders, so it was a nice gesture.

That's the formula--then as long as the food ain't utter crap, money will be made!\n\nWell, first of, for those who have been to France, you would know there is no such thing as a French meal, be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner, without bread served first.  Period.  Never.  (Well, unless we're talking eating at McDonald's.)  So guess what?--they never gave us table bread.  Maybe that sounds silly to us Americans, but I'm pretty sure that's a crazy huge deal if committed in France.\n\nAlright.... so.... that's kinda how it went...\n\n1.

Most of us have had baked brie before right?--big round of cheese oozing from the white outer crust, often breaded?  Well, the cheese was totally an after thought.  They just basically put a quarter of a round of brie, possibly microwaved, cause the crust was all broken and dry--just plopped there.  Got some tomatoes and bread, which both were good.  But the cheese... wow... amazingly amateur.  2/10\n\n3. Soupe a l'Oignon $14 \"traditional French onion soup\":  You know, like most of us I've had dozens of these over the years.  Many from straight-up American restaurants, some from fancy schmancy French places too, and of all of them this might be the worst I've ever had.  The onions were so pulverized they were just a pile of mush on the bottom.  The bread was completely mushed too.  The soup was pretty flavorless.  Crap.  2/10\n\n4. Moules Marinieres $20 \"white wine, shallots, parsley and cream\":  Alright, things were looking better now.  The mussels, though pretty small, were very juicy and tender.  The sauce/soup was pretty good too.  Creamy and tasty.  The bread they served it with though just ruined it.  Like cheapo stale bread a day old from the supermarket.  Again, if you've been to France, you know how seriously they take their bread.  This ain't French bread.  Trust me.  5/10\n\n5.
