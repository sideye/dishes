A little crispy on the outside but the middle was chewy and deliciously caramelized with toffee.

She was right.. but I had to open the bottle cause I didn't think that the cream part would mix well.. it got kinda messy from there D:\n\nyou guys might think that... \"Hey this milk is old!\" or \"Hey!! Why is it chunky at the top?\" Duh, its not like the regular milk that you see at the grocery. I had taken the red cap type (its usually associated with Vit D or whole milk) which is apparently whole milk. I think this type of milk is the one that they boil/steam for coffee & cappuccino's also that thickness from the milk has a bit of that sour cream taste which I didn't mind really but did balance out when you were eating these cookies. \n\nNormally I don't go out for sweets but I like to has my cookies every now and then.\n\nThese cookies won't disappoint at all. I recommend this for any of you guys venturing to this area.

"], "author": "Chuck D.", "review": "I was in town this past weekend for the 49ers game & I made sure to make a stop at Anthony's. My trip back home just wouldn't be complete without it. My taste buds would never forgive me. I brought a friend with me who's a self-proclaimed cookie monster & I assured him he would love the cookies. I also told him if he was smart, he would bring some back to LA to his wife. He bought a dozen. He loved the cookies & cream (who wouldn't) & also got chocolate chip & toffee chip. He & his wife liked those as well. \n\nI opted for 3 dozen because I planned on those being my other carry-on for my flight back to LA the next night. I went with 2 dozen cookies & cream, 6 toffee chip & 6 candied pecan. I must say, as good as the cookies & cream are... the candied pecan is slowly becoming my favorite. I just wish the cookies were bigger.\n\nThere was a sign on one of the chalkboards introducing a new COFFEE COOKIE. It described it as made with 72% dark chocolate & hand pressed coffee. It sounded delicious to me and it was new so I asked the girl behind the counter to put two coffee cookies aside in a bag separate from the 2 boxes containing the 3 dozen cookies I ordered. I asked for the boxes to be string-tied closed. 1 because it's an old school touch that I like when buying baked goods such as the Jewish bakery I go to in Fairfax District here in LA and 2 because it will ensure that I do not open it before I get home. HA! It works... The cookies stay pristine. I leave em alone. \n\nThe problem was when I got back to my hotel that night. I noticed the separate bag for the 2 coffee cookies was missing. I feared she forgot to give them to me. I checked my receipt & I was charged for them. Not cheap $1.75 per coffee cookie... So I hoped, had my fingers crossed that they were in one of the boxes. I still didn't want to untie the string... Maybe I should have. I was headed to the Niner game the next am so there was no time to go back to Anthony's anyway. It was a morning til evening affair at the stadium... Alas, when I got home, I discovered there were no coffee cookies. I was bummed... Also was bummed for my friend Kat T. who asked me to bring her 1 coffee cookie home. She was bummed & suggested I call them.\n\nSo I called Anthony's when I got back to LA... Im usually not the complaining type but I felt the need to call & just let them know what happened so they can be more careful in the future. I spoke to Anna the business manager of Anthony's. She heard me out as I told her what happened. I told her I didn't want anyone to get in trouble. That wasn't the reason for my phone call... She was very pleasant to talk to, actually. She wanted to know what happened so she could advise her staff/front counter lead so that something like this wouldn't happen again. She asked for my email... She emailed me soon after we talked offering her sincerest apologies & thanked me for bringing the incident to their attention... They would use it to improve their service... I can tell you that Anna rectified the situation. She went beyond my expectations as far as service recovery & hearing me out. I appreciated that.\n\nThat's why these are the types of businesses I will always support... Anthony's Cookies being in my hometown & making the best damn cookies I've ever had are just icing on the cookie. Please go there... Go there now.

Recently, I discovered Golden Oreo Cookies, where I don't really have to do much of anything to them, but then I miss out on the chocolate flavor.\n\nThis is where Anthony's Cookies come in -- hands down the best cookies I've ever had. Their Cookies & Cream are so delicious and the perfect blend of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. AND--- It is the first cookie I've had that I love drinking milk with! It also doesn't hurt that the organic milk they have at the store is really good quality.T heir packaging and bags are really cute here too and would make great presents if you're having a hard time thinking of something.\n\nSome of the flavors I didn't appreciate as much: White Chocolate Chip (wish they had macadamian nuts and I didn't like the white chocolate so much), Oatmeal Raisin (Mother's Iced Oatmeal does it for me better) and Toffee Chip (my sister told me I should have waited a day to eat it, tastes better). Boyfriend really likes the Cinnamon Spice, but I can only have one at a time since they are a bit too on the \"spice\" side for me.\n\nI used to work for Mrs. Fields where the cookies are frozen and then put in the oven and way more expensive. I will probably never patron Mrs. Fields ever again now. However, I do think Mrs. Fields Butter Toffee beats the Toffee Chip here and the Mrs. Fields Snickerdoodles are too different from the Cinnamon Spice to compare.\n\nI think people can get very passionate about these cookies-- my sister got really upset when my brother ate her cookies and she always makes sure now I buy a separate dozen for her that no one else can have.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I also quite enjoy their classic chocolate chip, toffee chip and their peanut butter cookie melts in your mouth.

I guess it was a sign? Haa Haa! Anyways, it was on the way home, so we thought what the hell, let's go!\n\nWe arrived at 4 PM to a near empty store. Uh-oh, I thought....I hope they still have the Cookies and Cream left as I've heard they tend to sell out first.\n\nFLAVORS (varies by day):\n*Cookies and Cream: Everyday\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*Walnut Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*White Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin: Everyday\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n*Toffee Chip: Everyday\n*Cinnamon Sugar: Everyday\n*Double Chocolate Chip: Mon, Fri, Sat\n*Peanut Butter: Tues, Wed, Thurs, Sat\n*German Chocolate: Mon, Fri, Sat\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: Fri, Sat, Sun\n*Banana Walnut: Thurs, Sun\n*Banana: Thurs, Sun\n\nPRICES: \n*$1.25/cookie\n*$6 for 6 cookies\n*$11 for a dozen\n*$5 for each add'l dozen\n\nCC's accepted.\n\nI decided to get a dozen and went w/ the following flavors:\n*Cookies and Cream: Ummm, OMFG! How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk. There are no restrooms.\n\nPARKING:\nSlightly difficult street parking, although it's not as bad as around the Valencia area btw 15th and 23rd Streets. \n\nIt's only been 3 days and I'm already trying to find an excuse to hit up \"The Mission\", so I can buy another dozen to take home.

Thankfully, Anthony's does it right! Lots of quality chocolate throughout with the perfect chewiness. \n\nDark chocolate: A more \"adult\" version of their classic chocolate chip, these are made with dark chocolate disks rather than chips.

You are welcome to mix and match flavors to your desire.\n\nThe cookies are between 2-1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  Anthony asked whether I could try a cookie in the store before I left and let him know what I thought.  I sampled a Cookies and Cream.  The edges of the still warm cookie were nice and crispy, and the interior of the cookie was nice and chewy.  I loved the contrast between the two.  The cookie was sweet without being overly sweet.  I wished I had a tall, cold glass of milk right then and there.  It would have been the perfect milk and cookies scenario.\n\nI purchased four flavors on this visit, and I've included photos of each.\n\nCookies and Cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=nghb57S-WlCQeayzJiw4EQ) - Unique and different.  The cookies are made with crushed Oreo cookies mixed into the base cookie batter.  These were the absolute favorites.  Had I known I would have hidden these from my co-workers.\n\nToffee Chip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=776m0nIU8bmU8CzpgmpkLg) - These cookies were crispier than the others.  Bits of butter toffee are melted into the cookie batter to give the cookie its excellent butter toffee flavor.\n\nCinnamon Sugar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=57_GBexV9-qN8jHetM3IhQ) - The cookie had just a hint of cinnamon flavor.  These were dusted with very fine sugar crystals.  I think these would be perfect to jumpstart a lazy morning.  My co-workers agreed as they only left me half a cookie.  \n\nDouble Chocolate Chip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=2pHRiyQ3pwzM_0FKGeMqvw) - It's a chocolate cookie with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I only sampled a quarter of one as my co-workers apparently loved this one also.\n\nI'll be returning soon to pick up some cookies for myself and the family to enjoy.  As there is no store sign up yet look for the address number and the cookie flyer adhered to the window.  For now, I believe it is cash only.  Please give Anthony's Cookies a try, and show Anthony some Yelper love!", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-04-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Sampled the toffee chip and cookies & cream, and ended up getting the classic chocolate chip.

While I sit here and type my Yelp review, feeling like a corporate drone and uninspired on company time, I think of Anthony four years ago.

If that's not a success story that warms your heart, then I'm sorry you are so bitter. Have a cookie.\n\nMy plan for the Mission was to succumb to the ice cream pulls. My cousins intervened and instructed me to visit Anthony's Cookies instead. With a false address in mind, I walked 4 blocks down Valencia in the wrong direction. I was about to give up on Anthony's when I got a text with the correct address. The text was then followed up with a phone call. My cousins were not going to let me leave the Bay without tasting Anthony's Cookies. And now that I have tasted them, I won't let YOU leave the BAY without having one... or two... OK three!\n\nI walked away with a dozen to bring to a dinner party. We picked cookies and cream, cinnamon spice, oatmeal cranberry, chocolate chip, toffee chip, and walnut chip. Since there was a big group of us, my friend cut them into fourths so we could try them all.

They are small but simple cookies made with a lot of butter, crispy on the outside, flat, and perfect in every way. The flavors are strong and I am so curious now about the organic peanut butter cookie and the banana cookie. Before Anthony's, I couldn't envision what a cookies and cream cookie would look like.

Thanks to Cherlynn and Jeanette's reviews and probably a few more from my peers...\n\nLets cut to the chase, while I was still undecided from finding a place to eat on a Friday I decided to grab some stuff for the house to go. While I was trying to find this place on the map, I actually found that I was on the opposite side of the street.\n\nAt first it seems that there is nobody here.. but then you see someone at the counter and a couple workers in the back baking. There was a gal this Friday that I did see and I had told her it was my first time being in here. I decided to come here on a whim due to the fact that I saw it at the bottom page of the yelp site.

Soon after... there were a few people that came in just as soon as I stepped in to order that flash 2 dozen. Then I decided to get the Organic milk that I seen from the pictures to try. Note that I only had 3 out of the 24 that I has + The milk....\n\nThe gal that was helping me get my bakes told me that if it was my first time trying this milk that you would have to shake it since the fat content was plugged at the top. She was right.. but I had to open the bottle cause I didn't think that the cream part would mix well.. it got kinda messy from there D:\n\nyou guys might think that... \"Hey this milk is old!\" or \"Hey!! Why is it chunky at the top?\" Duh, its not like the regular milk that you see at the grocery. I had taken the red cap type (its usually associated with Vit D or whole milk) which is apparently whole milk. I think this type of milk is the one that they boil/steam for coffee & cappuccino's also that thickness from the milk has a bit of that sour cream taste which I didn't mind really but did balance out when you were eating these cookies. \n\nNormally I don't go out for sweets but I like to has my cookies every now and then.\n\nThese cookies won't disappoint at all.

I'm a chocoholic so I was surprised that my favorite cookies of the bunch were all of the non-chocolate flavors. However, I loved the crispy on the outside/chewy on the inside texture of this cookie and thought it had just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nToffee Chip: My second favorite! The toffee pieces were gooey and tasty and the rest of the cookie was great too.\n\nSemi-Sweet Chocolate Chip: Nothing you wouldn't already expect from a chocolate chip cookie, but still very delicious!\n\nWalnut Chocolate Chip: Identical to the semi-sweet chocolate chip, but with tasty walnuts throughout.\n\nBanana: Tasted more like the top of a banana muffin than an actual cookie, but I loved this one too!\n\nCookies and Cream: Anthony Cookie's signature flavor. I expected greatness, but found the cookie to be a bit bland. I couldn't really taste the cookie pieces and overall found it difficult to sense a distinct flavor to the cookie. The only miss of the bunch.\n\nOverall, I give the cookies at Anthony's 4.5 stars. However, I'll definitely round up to 5 stars for Anthony's outstanding service. Immediately upon entering the store, Anthony greeted me and gave me a very warm welcome. The rest of the staff was also super friendly (and were even generous enough to give me a free cookie for my first visit!).

I showed up around 1 or so and met up with Lolia S. right at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Matt G. stumbled upon the two of us, and the Holy Sweets Trinity was formed. The line was pretty long when we arrived, but it was much longer after we finally got our cookies. \n\nEach person in line was granted one free cookie for the Grand Opening special, which was more than I had expected (I was expecting maybe crumbles of cookies at most, I don't know why). The wait wasn't too long, considering, when I was in sight of the front counter, I could see Anthony and others rushing around in the back baking up more batches of cookies for the crowds. \n\nIn terms of the store itself, it's still of course very new. There's only a small sign posted in the window so far, but the interior is decorated rather nicely with beautiful photos of ingredients. The front counter area is lined with milk bottles and a makeshift menu is handwritten on the left wall in permanent marker. They have an Odwalla cooler to the right, and looks like they will soon serve coffee and tea as well.\n\nThere are currently twelve flavors available:\n\n1. Cookies and Cream\n2. Semi-sweet Chocolate Chip\n3. White Chocolate Chip\n4. Cinnamon Sugar\n5. Toffee Chip\n6. Double Chocolate Chip\n7. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin\n8. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n9. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n10. Walnut Chocolate Chip\n11. Banana\n12. Banana Walnut\n\nAccording to Matt G., one cookie costs $1, so buying in bulk is a better deal. I decided to go with a half-dozen for $5; for my free sample, I chose the Cinnamon Sugar, which was so warm and fresh. The taste of the cinnamon was very distinct in the cookie, and the texture was chewy, but not doughy. \n\nFor the half-dozen, I went with three Cookies & Cream and three Banana. I'm not sure if they ended up giving me the Banana Walnut instead, though, but it didn't matter to me. The Banana/Banana Walnut cookie was very bread-like, almost like Banana Bread. The Cookies & Cream screamed its namesake upon first bite--really, it's amazing that Anthony has concocted this mix. Very unique and original; will probably make the ice cream lovers forget  about the flavor and convert to the cookie. \n\nThe size of the cookies are average (to me): not as big as those cookies you'd find at a convenience store, but not bite-sized either. The Banana varieties are slightly smaller than the other flavors, probably due to the banana/bread consistency. Overall, I like a cookie shop with out-of-the-ordinary flavors yet also promoting some relatively healthy options (i.e., the whole wheat varieties).\n\nService was amiable and efficient, considering how busy they were in preparing more cookies and trying to get the line moving along quickly as well. I rather enjoyed my experience there, and I hope to be back soon again (perhaps I need to make a point to head over to the Mission more often anyway). For the time being, cash only, but with the popularity already booming for the shop, I wouldn't be surprised when they start accepting cards as well.\n\nAs a final note--Anthony's has already earned a Yelp sticker; quite fast!

I needed to satisfy my pms-cravings and wanted to indulge in one last thing before the new year, so I settled on cookies =). Good choice 'cuz these, by far, are the best cookies I've eaten. And here I thought Mrs. Field's cookies were yummy. Anthony's cookies are slightly smaller and $$ for the size, but they are just delish!!!\n\nI bought three different kinds. They're $1.25 a cookie and I didn't want to buy a lot in case I didn't like them....;-). I settled on the cookies n' cream (popular one according to Yelp), the toffee chip, and the candied pecan chocolate chip. I ate half the toffee chip when I got home and put the rest away. Okay, I hid them from myself, but  I couldn't resist and ate the other half of the toffee chip and half of the candied pecan with choc. chip. and saved the cookies n' cream and half of the candied pecan to eat the next day. Surprisingly enough, I resisted 'til the next day. I had to. Anthony's was going to be closed from Jan 1-8, so I knew I wouldn't be able to go back for more cookies for another week!!! Just as well, 'cuz I know I would've been stopping by this place on my way home from BART every evening =). These cookies are irresistible. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Texture is perfect!! \n\nOh, if you buy six, they're $6, and $12 for a dozen. Worth buying six or more than just one, two, or three. You just have to be able to resist eating them all in one sitting =D. Menu changes daily (I believe), but the popular ones, like the cookies n' cream, are always on the daily menu. Now I have to go back and go down the list of cookies to try. Hmmm...if I buy six, then I can eat one a day....yeah right!! =D", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I preferred the toffee chip cookie."], "author": "Eve C.", "review": "I had the cookies and cream cookie and well I have to say it was good but I have had better.

Your mind plays tricks on you until you get your first bite.\n\nAnthony's cookies are fresh and sweet. Nothing more than the other cookies I've had. And believe me, I've had many.

Yes, people actually smiling at their customer and while they work.

I was celebrating my birthday this past Saturday, and used the afternoon to gather up every treat in my path in preparation for a delicious night of sinful gluttony. \n\nI found my way over to Anthony's mid-afternoon. Parking wasn't much of an issue but I'm sure half the city was down in the Marina celebrating Fleet Week so it may have been a fluke. I was practically running down the sidewalk while my boyfriend fed the meter, but when I got to the storefront the door was locked. It was around 2PM and the sign said they closed at 5. So I jiggled the door handle a little harder because I could see a few employees and one customer milling about inside. I peered in through the glass as everyone looked at me in disgust as if I were a pathetic stray puppy begging for scraps. I'm not one to give up in these situations. If they were hoping I'd wander off to some other cookie dispensary, they were mistaken. My desire for cookies trumped my annoyance that none of the employees could bother themselves to open the door. \n\nAbout 5-10 minutes later, the customer left the store and I made my move. By this time, a few other people joined the resistance outside and we flooded in ready to get our fix. \n\nI ordered the much-hyped cookies and cream, a German chocolate, peanut butter, white chocolate chip, chocolate chip, and a coffee cookie for the bf. I was a little surprised at how small they were for the price, but that just meant I had more room for more cookies so I was cool with it. \n\nTo say I was let down is an understatement. I've never met a cookie I didn't like, and that was no exception here, but they weren't really that great. My boyfriend actually took a bite of the coffee and threw the rest out, but I hate coffee myself so I can't really comment further on that. The cookies and cream was pretty good and the only one I actually finished. Everything else was a resounding Meh. They were a little too crunchy and dry for my taste - like crouton cookies. I prefer the gooier, softer, chewier kind. I could whip up cookies myself that are better than this. \n\nFor everyone on here claiming these are the best cookies you've ever had... do you eat a lot of cookies?

How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk. There are no restrooms.\n\nPARKING:\nSlightly difficult street parking, although it's not as bad as around the Valencia area btw 15th and 23rd Streets. \n\nIt's only been 3 days and I'm already trying to find an excuse to hit up \"The Mission\", so I can buy another dozen to take home.

I showed up around 1 or so and met up with Lolia S. right at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Matt G. stumbled upon the two of us, and the Holy Sweets Trinity was formed. The line was pretty long when we arrived, but it was much longer after we finally got our cookies. \n\nEach person in line was granted one free cookie for the Grand Opening special, which was more than I had expected (I was expecting maybe crumbles of cookies at most, I don't know why). The wait wasn't too long, considering, when I was in sight of the front counter, I could see Anthony and others rushing around in the back baking up more batches of cookies for the crowds. \n\nIn terms of the store itself, it's still of course very new. There's only a small sign posted in the window so far, but the interior is decorated rather nicely with beautiful photos of ingredients. The front counter area is lined with milk bottles and a makeshift menu is handwritten on the left wall in permanent marker. They have an Odwalla cooler to the right, and looks like they will soon serve coffee and tea as well.\n\nThere are currently twelve flavors available:\n\n1. Cookies and Cream\n2. Semi-sweet Chocolate Chip\n3. White Chocolate Chip\n4. Cinnamon Sugar\n5. Toffee Chip\n6. Double Chocolate Chip\n7. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin\n8. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n9. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n10. Walnut Chocolate Chip\n11. Banana\n12. Banana Walnut\n\nAccording to Matt G., one cookie costs $1, so buying in bulk is a better deal. I decided to go with a half-dozen for $5; for my free sample, I chose the Cinnamon Sugar, which was so warm and fresh. The taste of the cinnamon was very distinct in the cookie, and the texture was chewy, but not doughy. \n\nFor the half-dozen, I went with three Cookies & Cream and three Banana. I'm not sure if they ended up giving me the Banana Walnut instead, though, but it didn't matter to me. The Banana/Banana Walnut cookie was very bread-like, almost like Banana Bread. The Cookies & Cream screamed its namesake upon first bite--really, it's amazing that Anthony has concocted this mix. Very unique and original; will probably make the ice cream lovers forget  about the flavor and convert to the cookie. \n\nThe size of the cookies are average (to me): not as big as those cookies you'd find at a convenience store, but not bite-sized either. The Banana varieties are slightly smaller than the other flavors, probably due to the banana/bread consistency. Overall, I like a cookie shop with out-of-the-ordinary flavors yet also promoting some relatively healthy options (i.e., the whole wheat varieties).\n\nService was amiable and efficient, considering how busy they were in preparing more cookies and trying to get the line moving along quickly as well. I rather enjoyed my experience there, and I hope to be back soon again (perhaps I need to make a point to head over to the Mission more often anyway). For the time being, cash only, but with the popularity already booming for the shop, I wouldn't be surprised when they start accepting cards as well.\n\nAs a final note--Anthony's has already earned a Yelp sticker; quite fast!

I guess it was a sign? Haa Haa! Anyways, it was on the way home, so we thought what the hell, let's go!\n\nWe arrived at 4 PM to a near empty store. Uh-oh, I thought....I hope they still have the Cookies and Cream left as I've heard they tend to sell out first.\n\nFLAVORS (varies by day):\n*Cookies and Cream: Everyday\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*Walnut Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*White Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin: Everyday\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n*Toffee Chip: Everyday\n*Cinnamon Sugar: Everyday\n*Double Chocolate Chip: Mon, Fri, Sat\n*Peanut Butter: Tues, Wed, Thurs, Sat\n*German Chocolate: Mon, Fri, Sat\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: Fri, Sat, Sun\n*Banana Walnut: Thurs, Sun\n*Banana: Thurs, Sun\n\nPRICES: \n*$1.25/cookie\n*$6 for 6 cookies\n*$11 for a dozen\n*$5 for each add'l dozen\n\nCC's accepted.\n\nI decided to get a dozen and went w/ the following flavors:\n*Cookies and Cream: Ummm, OMFG! How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk. There are no restrooms.\n\nPARKING:\nSlightly difficult street parking, although it's not as bad as around the Valencia area btw 15th and 23rd Streets. \n\nIt's only been 3 days and I'm already trying to find an excuse to hit up \"The Mission\", so I can buy another dozen to take home.

She recommended the double chocolate chip or the cinnamon sugar. My mom not being a chocolate fan said to go with the cinnamon sugar.\n\nso 3 cinnamon sugar.\n\n$11. not bad. They aren't huge cookies but they are yummy. And way better than Mrs Fields. Hands down.\n\nMy faves of the bunch the cookies n cream and candied pecan choco chip. The cinnamon sugar had too much cinnamon in it and then oatmeal raisin could have used some cinnamon in it. But that won't sway me from making a cookie stop again. A nice light crunch around the edges and nice and chewy in the middle. Just how I like em.\n\nJust as good as homemade, maybe in some cases if not better.

I showed up around 1 or so and met up with Lolia S. right at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Matt G. stumbled upon the two of us, and the Holy Sweets Trinity was formed. The line was pretty long when we arrived, but it was much longer after we finally got our cookies. \n\nEach person in line was granted one free cookie for the Grand Opening special, which was more than I had expected (I was expecting maybe crumbles of cookies at most, I don't know why). The wait wasn't too long, considering, when I was in sight of the front counter, I could see Anthony and others rushing around in the back baking up more batches of cookies for the crowds. \n\nIn terms of the store itself, it's still of course very new. There's only a small sign posted in the window so far, but the interior is decorated rather nicely with beautiful photos of ingredients. The front counter area is lined with milk bottles and a makeshift menu is handwritten on the left wall in permanent marker. They have an Odwalla cooler to the right, and looks like they will soon serve coffee and tea as well.\n\nThere are currently twelve flavors available:\n\n1. Cookies and Cream\n2. Semi-sweet Chocolate Chip\n3. White Chocolate Chip\n4. Cinnamon Sugar\n5. Toffee Chip\n6. Double Chocolate Chip\n7. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin\n8. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n9. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n10. Walnut Chocolate Chip\n11. Banana\n12. Banana Walnut\n\nAccording to Matt G., one cookie costs $1, so buying in bulk is a better deal. I decided to go with a half-dozen for $5; for my free sample, I chose the Cinnamon Sugar, which was so warm and fresh. The taste of the cinnamon was very distinct in the cookie, and the texture was chewy, but not doughy. \n\nFor the half-dozen, I went with three Cookies & Cream and three Banana. I'm not sure if they ended up giving me the Banana Walnut instead, though, but it didn't matter to me. The Banana/Banana Walnut cookie was very bread-like, almost like Banana Bread. The Cookies & Cream screamed its namesake upon first bite--really, it's amazing that Anthony has concocted this mix. Very unique and original; will probably make the ice cream lovers forget  about the flavor and convert to the cookie. \n\nThe size of the cookies are average (to me): not as big as those cookies you'd find at a convenience store, but not bite-sized either. The Banana varieties are slightly smaller than the other flavors, probably due to the banana/bread consistency. Overall, I like a cookie shop with out-of-the-ordinary flavors yet also promoting some relatively healthy options (i.e., the whole wheat varieties).\n\nService was amiable and efficient, considering how busy they were in preparing more cookies and trying to get the line moving along quickly as well. I rather enjoyed my experience there, and I hope to be back soon again (perhaps I need to make a point to head over to the Mission more often anyway). For the time being, cash only, but with the popularity already booming for the shop, I wouldn't be surprised when they start accepting cards as well.\n\nAs a final note--Anthony's has already earned a Yelp sticker; quite fast!

Let's walk through your average clientele for this establishment. \n\n\"Hi my name is Tim and I just got home from work at Faceboogle. I make sure the things you search on the Internet show up in your news feed and I like to spend the money I save on public transportation on Anthony's cookies. I can't get laid but this shop is the equivalent of buying a gallon of toll house cookie dough and eating it while I cry watching Marley and Me on Netflix alone on Valentine's Day. Except I can only get a single 1oz cookie for the price of a 12oz toll house but I can afford it because I work at Faceboogle, did I mention that already?\"\n\nI digress... This place was aiight.

Unfortunately, I was not at all impressed. Sure, it tasted good...but maybe all of the hype got my expectations too high. I have definitely had much better cookies.\n\nThe cookies here are mostly very small also, which is not necessarily a bad thing, as it makes it easier to try a variety of cookies. But they were surprisingly small.\n\nBoth their Candied Pecan Chocolate Chip and Walnut Double Chocolate Chip were better than the Cookies & Cream. The Toffee Chip was not so great though. This was one of their bigger cookies, but it was flatter and not as chewy, which is a big downside (they actually probably all contained about the same amount of batter, but the Toffee Chip was just flattened out more).\n\nCookies are pretty much my favorite food, so I find it hard to give a cookie shop below 3 stars, but I would not necessarily recommend this place. As long as you don't mind running the risk of seeing some bottomless men walking around with their junk hanging out, I would highly recommend instead heading over to Hot Cookie in the Castro for some amazing cookies, where they also have plenty of peanut butter.

I guess it was a sign? Haa Haa! Anyways, it was on the way home, so we thought what the hell, let's go!\n\nWe arrived at 4 PM to a near empty store.

How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk. There are no restrooms.\n\nPARKING:\nSlightly difficult street parking, although it's not as bad as around the Valencia area btw 15th and 23rd Streets. \n\nIt's only been 3 days and I'm already trying to find an excuse to hit up \"The Mission\", so I can buy another dozen to take home.

Without a doubt the door or window will probably sport a bright red \"People Love Us on Yelp\" decal.\n\nAnthony comes across as a man who takes pride in his cookies, in the thirteen years of experience he has in creating these cookies and in the quality of the ingredients of his cookies.  I stopped in shortly after his store opened on Thursday morning and purchased two dozen cookies to take back to the office to share with my co-workers.  Anthony's Cookies currently offers 12 exciting flavors of cookies which are sold by the half dozen.  Here is an image of his offerings and prices as of April 2009 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=fX99YW7vxoa7hQjO2IPQoQ).  You are welcome to mix and match flavors to your desire.\n\nThe cookies are between 2-1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  Anthony asked whether I could try a cookie in the store before I left and let him know what I thought.  I sampled a Cookies and Cream.  The edges of the still warm cookie were nice and crispy, and the interior of the cookie was nice and chewy.  I loved the contrast between the two.  The cookie was sweet without being overly sweet.  I wished I had a tall, cold glass of milk right then and there.  It would have been the perfect milk and cookies scenario.\n\nI purchased four flavors on this visit, and I've included photos of each.\n\nCookies and Cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=nghb57S-WlCQeayzJiw4EQ) - Unique and different.  The cookies are made with crushed Oreo cookies mixed into the base cookie batter.  These were the absolute favorites.  Had I known I would have hidden these from my co-workers.\n\nToffee Chip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=776m0nIU8bmU8CzpgmpkLg) - These cookies were crispier than the others.  Bits of butter toffee are melted into the cookie batter to give the cookie its excellent butter toffee flavor.\n\nCinnamon Sugar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=57_GBexV9-qN8jHetM3IhQ) - The cookie had just a hint of cinnamon flavor.  These were dusted with very fine sugar crystals.  I think these would be perfect to jumpstart a lazy morning.  My co-workers agreed as they only left me half a cookie.  \n\nDouble Chocolate Chip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=2pHRiyQ3pwzM_0FKGeMqvw) - It's a chocolate cookie with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I only sampled a quarter of one as my co-workers apparently loved this one also.\n\nI'll be returning soon to pick up some cookies for myself and the family to enjoy.

I showed up around 1 or so and met up with Lolia S. right at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Matt G. stumbled upon the two of us, and the Holy Sweets Trinity was formed. The line was pretty long when we arrived, but it was much longer after we finally got our cookies. \n\nEach person in line was granted one free cookie for the Grand Opening special, which was more than I had expected (I was expecting maybe crumbles of cookies at most, I don't know why). The wait wasn't too long, considering, when I was in sight of the front counter, I could see Anthony and others rushing around in the back baking up more batches of cookies for the crowds. \n\nIn terms of the store itself, it's still of course very new. There's only a small sign posted in the window so far, but the interior is decorated rather nicely with beautiful photos of ingredients. The front counter area is lined with milk bottles and a makeshift menu is handwritten on the left wall in permanent marker. They have an Odwalla cooler to the right, and looks like they will soon serve coffee and tea as well.\n\nThere are currently twelve flavors available:\n\n1. Cookies and Cream\n2. Semi-sweet Chocolate Chip\n3. White Chocolate Chip\n4. Cinnamon Sugar\n5. Toffee Chip\n6. Double Chocolate Chip\n7. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin\n8. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n9. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n10. Walnut Chocolate Chip\n11. Banana\n12. Banana Walnut\n\nAccording to Matt G., one cookie costs $1, so buying in bulk is a better deal. I decided to go with a half-dozen for $5; for my free sample, I chose the Cinnamon Sugar, which was so warm and fresh. The taste of the cinnamon was very distinct in the cookie, and the texture was chewy, but not doughy. \n\nFor the half-dozen, I went with three Cookies & Cream and three Banana. I'm not sure if they ended up giving me the Banana Walnut instead, though, but it didn't matter to me. The Banana/Banana Walnut cookie was very bread-like, almost like Banana Bread. The Cookies & Cream screamed its namesake upon first bite--really, it's amazing that Anthony has concocted this mix. Very unique and original; will probably make the ice cream lovers forget  about the flavor and convert to the cookie. \n\nThe size of the cookies are average (to me): not as big as those cookies you'd find at a convenience store, but not bite-sized either. The Banana varieties are slightly smaller than the other flavors, probably due to the banana/bread consistency. Overall, I like a cookie shop with out-of-the-ordinary flavors yet also promoting some relatively healthy options (i.e., the whole wheat varieties).\n\nService was amiable and efficient, considering how busy they were in preparing more cookies and trying to get the line moving along quickly as well. I rather enjoyed my experience there, and I hope to be back soon again (perhaps I need to make a point to head over to the Mission more often anyway). For the time being, cash only, but with the popularity already booming for the shop, I wouldn't be surprised when they start accepting cards as well.\n\nAs a final note--Anthony's has already earned a Yelp sticker; quite fast!

Your mind plays tricks on you until you get your first bite.\n\nAnthony's cookies are fresh and sweet. Nothing more than the other cookies I've had. And believe me, I've had many.  Some of Anthony's cookies were moist but not all.  I bit each cookie to taste each one like the COOKIE MONSTER that I am.  Then I've lost track of the taste despite drinking coffee in between.  \n\nI spent my lunch time taking the BART to Anthony's storefront cookie house.  I almost missed it.

My favorite were the toffee chip & german chocolate. They serve it to you off the baking sheets so you know they're fresh!\n\nRandom observations:\n* They have two kind of cookies, flat cookies (thin and crispy) and mound cookies (soft and chewy)\n* There are seasonal cookies that aren't available every day and daily cookies that are available (until they sell out of course)\n* Cookies are expensive! At the time of the review they were $1.75 (they are also 1oz in weight each)\n\nTried (and stack ranked from best to worst -- none were bad, but not as great):\n\nGerman chocolate: One of the mound cookies and it was incredible! Soft and chewy and filled with cocoa, coconut and chocolate. A tough combination to beat.\n\nToffee chip: One of the flat cookies. A little crispy on the outside but the middle was chewy and deliciously caramelized with toffee. It was a subtle sweetness that felt right.\n\nCookies and cream: Another flat cookie that was oreo-like in taste but with the chewiness of a chocolate chip dough. Honestly I wasn't very impressed with this and thought it was a bit dry.\n\nCandied pecan and chocolate chip: A mound cookies that was chewy and nutty. The chocolate chips didn't add to the experience but the candied pecans were yum!\n\nChocolate chip: A staple cookie that I get everywhere because it really speaks to how well the cookie dough is. Unimpressive as I thought the chocolate chips and the dough were separate entities and didn't fit well together. It was sweet and chewy but nothing spectacular. \n\nWhite chocolate: The white chocolate chips were small and felt separated from the overall cookie. Just tasted like a sweet cookie with bits of creaminess mixed in. Not impressed\n\nCinnamon spice: The closest they have to a snickerdoodle. The sweetness and cinnamon flavor was overpowering so I wasn't a fan but that's probably just personal taste", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The one I really wanted to get was the German chocolate but they just baked a fresh batch and couldn't serve the cookies while they were still warm.

Parking wasn't much of an issue but I'm sure half the city was down in the Marina celebrating Fleet Week so it may have been a fluke.

How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk.

Perfect balance between toffee & chocolate. \n\nOther cookies that I've had:\n- Cinnamon Sugar: Pretty tasty, great texture. But it has more of a cinnamon/gingersnap type flavor rather than being snickerdoodle-like.\n- German Chocolate: I liked this a lot! The chocolate isn't overly sweet but still enough to satisfy a chocolate craving. But for some reason, I swear these cookies are always smaller than the others. \n- Oatmeal Raisin & Oatmeal Cranberry: These aren't my favorite here. Out of all their cookies, I feel like these are the most dry. I prefer the oatmeal cranberry cookie at Hot Cookie. \n\nPrices are very reasonable... it's pretty much $1/cookie if you buy at least a 1/2 dozen. They're not the hugest cookies, but for the quality, it's well worth it.

I was celebrating my birthday this past Saturday, and used the afternoon to gather up every treat in my path in preparation for a delicious night of sinful gluttony. \n\nI found my way over to Anthony's mid-afternoon. Parking wasn't much of an issue but I'm sure half the city was down in the Marina celebrating Fleet Week so it may have been a fluke. I was practically running down the sidewalk while my boyfriend fed the meter, but when I got to the storefront the door was locked. It was around 2PM and the sign said they closed at 5. So I jiggled the door handle a little harder because I could see a few employees and one customer milling about inside. I peered in through the glass as everyone looked at me in disgust as if I were a pathetic stray puppy begging for scraps. I'm not one to give up in these situations. If they were hoping I'd wander off to some other cookie dispensary, they were mistaken. My desire for cookies trumped my annoyance that none of the employees could bother themselves to open the door. \n\nAbout 5-10 minutes later, the customer left the store and I made my move. By this time, a few other people joined the resistance outside and we flooded in ready to get our fix. \n\nI ordered the much-hyped cookies and cream, a German chocolate, peanut butter, white chocolate chip, chocolate chip, and a coffee cookie for the bf. I was a little surprised at how small they were for the price, but that just meant I had more room for more cookies so I was cool with it. \n\nTo say I was let down is an understatement. I've never met a cookie I didn't like, and that was no exception here, but they weren't really that great. My boyfriend actually took a bite of the coffee and threw the rest out, but I hate coffee myself so I can't really comment further on that. The cookies and cream was pretty good and the only one I actually finished. Everything else was a resounding Meh. They were a little too crunchy and dry for my taste - like crouton cookies. I prefer the gooier, softer, chewier kind. I could whip up cookies myself that are better than this. \n\nFor everyone on here claiming these are the best cookies you've ever had... do you eat a lot of cookies?

How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk.

They are flavorful, rich, not too sweet (at least, not the flavors I like), and so fresh, I can't resist!\n\nI'm especially partial to the DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHIP cookies and the DARK CHOCOLATE CHIP ones...but I also enjoyed the COOKIES & CREAM and WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIP varieties.  \n\nThe GERMAN CHOCOLATE cookie was interesting, but I wouldn't list it among my favorites...and I've yet to get there on one of the days when I can get a PEANUT BUTTER cookie...but I will someday, trust me!\n\nThat's the other thing:  they only offer certain flavors all the time (cookies & cream, classic chocolate chip, white chocolate chip, whole wheat oatmeal raisin, and toffee chip).  The rest of the flavors depend on the day.  I think that Wednesday is my ideal day at Anthony's, when theoretically I can get ALL the flavors I like!\n\nThe cookies aren't huge, and I think that's part of the joy.  You don't have to commit to just one flavor, and you don't have to deal with a gigantic cookie if all you want is something small.  \n\nThis store is sadly NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE.  It's a shame, really, but I'm pretty sure that if you require access, they'll come to the door to assist you directly.  My partner usually goes in for me, or grabs them on the way home from work.\n\nTheir store hours make me happy, as they are open until 8 pm Mon-Sat...that means that those folks who work a little later in the evening can still get a cookie or two on their way home!  \n\nIf you are a cookie lover, check this place out.  I'd imagine that Anthony's Cookies might even convert a few other folks like me (ie, not generally into cookies) to the cause!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-12-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Tips:\n\n$1.25 a cookie\n$1.50 for peanut butter cookie\n\n$5 minimum for card\n\n", "I tried pretty much all the flavors, but my favorites are the \"Cookies and Cream\", \"Toffee\", and \"Peanut Butter\".\n\n", "The peanut butter cookie really is worth the extra 25 cents because it's made from organic peanut butter.

If that's not a success story that warms your heart, then I'm sorry you are so bitter. Have a cookie.\n\nMy plan for the Mission was to succumb to the ice cream pulls. My cousins intervened and instructed me to visit Anthony's Cookies instead. With a false address in mind, I walked 4 blocks down Valencia in the wrong direction.

OK three!\n\nI walked away with a dozen to bring to a dinner party. We picked cookies and cream, cinnamon spice, oatmeal cranberry, chocolate chip, toffee chip, and walnut chip.

Not only were these cookies the stuff dreams are made of but they leave an aftertaste of sweet memories as well. I love them and spent the whole night wishing I could have a whole cookie for myself.

I was celebrating my birthday this past Saturday, and used the afternoon to gather up every treat in my path in preparation for a delicious night of sinful gluttony. \n\nI found my way over to Anthony's mid-afternoon. Parking wasn't much of an issue but I'm sure half the city was down in the Marina celebrating Fleet Week so it may have been a fluke. I was practically running down the sidewalk while my boyfriend fed the meter, but when I got to the storefront the door was locked. It was around 2PM and the sign said they closed at 5. So I jiggled the door handle a little harder because I could see a few employees and one customer milling about inside. I peered in through the glass as everyone looked at me in disgust as if I were a pathetic stray puppy begging for scraps. I'm not one to give up in these situations. If they were hoping I'd wander off to some other cookie dispensary, they were mistaken. My desire for cookies trumped my annoyance that none of the employees could bother themselves to open the door. \n\nAbout 5-10 minutes later, the customer left the store and I made my move. By this time, a few other people joined the resistance outside and we flooded in ready to get our fix. \n\nI ordered the much-hyped cookies and cream, a German chocolate, peanut butter, white chocolate chip, chocolate chip, and a coffee cookie for the bf. I was a little surprised at how small they were for the price, but that just meant I had more room for more cookies so I was cool with it. \n\nTo say I was let down is an understatement. I've never met a cookie I didn't like, and that was no exception here, but they weren't really that great. My boyfriend actually took a bite of the coffee and threw the rest out, but I hate coffee myself so I can't really comment further on that. The cookies and cream was pretty good and the only one I actually finished. Everything else was a resounding Meh. They were a little too crunchy and dry for my taste - like crouton cookies. I prefer the gooier, softer, chewier kind. I could whip up cookies myself that are better than this. \n\nFor everyone on here claiming these are the best cookies you've ever had... do you eat a lot of cookies?

I guess it was a sign? Haa Haa! Anyways, it was on the way home, so we thought what the hell, let's go!\n\nWe arrived at 4 PM to a near empty store.

How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk. There are no restrooms.\n\nPARKING:\nSlightly difficult street parking, although it's not as bad as around the Valencia area btw 15th and 23rd Streets. \n\nIt's only been 3 days and I'm already trying to find an excuse to hit up \"The Mission\", so I can buy another dozen to take home.

I showed up around 1 or so and met up with Lolia S. right at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Matt G. stumbled upon the two of us, and the Holy Sweets Trinity was formed. The line was pretty long when we arrived, but it was much longer after we finally got our cookies. \n\nEach person in line was granted one free cookie for the Grand Opening special, which was more than I had expected (I was expecting maybe crumbles of cookies at most, I don't know why). The wait wasn't too long, considering, when I was in sight of the front counter, I could see Anthony and others rushing around in the back baking up more batches of cookies for the crowds. \n\nIn terms of the store itself, it's still of course very new. There's only a small sign posted in the window so far, but the interior is decorated rather nicely with beautiful photos of ingredients. The front counter area is lined with milk bottles and a makeshift menu is handwritten on the left wall in permanent marker. They have an Odwalla cooler to the right, and looks like they will soon serve coffee and tea as well.\n\nThere are currently twelve flavors available:\n\n1. Cookies and Cream\n2. Semi-sweet Chocolate Chip\n3. White Chocolate Chip\n4. Cinnamon Sugar\n5. Toffee Chip\n6. Double Chocolate Chip\n7. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin\n8. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n9. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n10. Walnut Chocolate Chip\n11. Banana\n12. Banana Walnut\n\nAccording to Matt G., one cookie costs $1, so buying in bulk is a better deal. I decided to go with a half-dozen for $5; for my free sample, I chose the Cinnamon Sugar, which was so warm and fresh. The taste of the cinnamon was very distinct in the cookie, and the texture was chewy, but not doughy. \n\nFor the half-dozen, I went with three Cookies & Cream and three Banana. I'm not sure if they ended up giving me the Banana Walnut instead, though, but it didn't matter to me. The Banana/Banana Walnut cookie was very bread-like, almost like Banana Bread. The Cookies & Cream screamed its namesake upon first bite--really, it's amazing that Anthony has concocted this mix. Very unique and original; will probably make the ice cream lovers forget  about the flavor and convert to the cookie. \n\nThe size of the cookies are average (to me): not as big as those cookies you'd find at a convenience store, but not bite-sized either. The Banana varieties are slightly smaller than the other flavors, probably due to the banana/bread consistency. Overall, I like a cookie shop with out-of-the-ordinary flavors yet also promoting some relatively healthy options (i.e., the whole wheat varieties).\n\nService was amiable and efficient, considering how busy they were in preparing more cookies and trying to get the line moving along quickly as well. I rather enjoyed my experience there, and I hope to be back soon again (perhaps I need to make a point to head over to the Mission more often anyway). For the time being, cash only, but with the popularity already booming for the shop, I wouldn't be surprised when they start accepting cards as well.\n\nAs a final note--Anthony's has already earned a Yelp sticker; quite fast!

Freshly baked and still warm, the thin unassuming cookie is encapsulated by the crunchy outer layer yet the inside is filled with the soft gooey and chewy center.  The sweet cookie dough encompasses tiny Oreo cream in every bite and it's teeming full of that rich, butter taste.\n\nToffee Chip was a welcome mistake. I originally ordered the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip, instead I was presented with the honey colored cookie filled with rich, toffee chip bits.  Sweet but not overly sugary, this cookie passed my test.\n\nWhole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip was more solid than the rest.
