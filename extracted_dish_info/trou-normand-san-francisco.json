I am familiar with the building as being the location of Yelp's main offices, just a few seconds up the elevator.  Mourad flanks the office entrance on the right while Trou Normand is to the left.  \nComing mid morning, I found parking on 2nd Street, just a block away.  I bumped into my cousin walking there so, when we entered, we were led to a large table under their greenhouse outdoor dining area.  It was mostly full and packed by the time we left.  \nAfter a quick menu study and some discussion, here's what I tried:\n\nShared\n1) Charcuterie board (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1-jevt-NqsrkgufRFcm9tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My cousin chose the eight item combination for our party of six and we barely finished it.  The best I've had, but I've only tried Perbacco's.\n\n2) Biscuit (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=In9dVmSKbdMO4pXq_2spxw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - It was okay, but not must-have good in my book.  Red Lobster's will do for me...\n\nMain\n3) Pork Belly (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=S7V9d1aJiu5v6EZQn9nCQw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I thoroughly enjoyed my entr\u00e9e as did my other relatives.  They had the rabbit and enjoyed mine more.\n\nThe breads, which I believe came from Acme, were delicious and fresh, perfect accompaniments to their breakfast menu whether it was the prosciutto, salumis, or just to sop up runny egg yolk from their dishes.  Our waiter was efficient and very precise in pointing our recommendations to us.  Prices were average for the area especially being a newer entry to this booming neighborhood.  I didn't know the charcuterie price, which was not cheap, until reviewing their online menu.  The diners were a mix of 20's to 30's groups outside and couples and tourists inside; if you're dining alone, you can sidle up to the bar.\nThanks to my kind and generous cousin, we enjoyed good food, service, and, of course, company.  Will be back and will keep this in mind if visiting friends are staying in or around the Financial District, Union Square, or SOMA.  Oh, and brunch works for me.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-04-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I used to dream about Trou Normand's breakfast sandwiches (and the biscuit! with homemade jam!), and then they stopped serving breakfast.\n\n"], "author": "Krista L.", "review": "I used to dream about Trou Normand's breakfast sandwiches (and the biscuit! with homemade jam!), and then they stopped serving breakfast.\n\nAnd then, what was already a pricey drink treat got more expensive-- a menu photo from 2014 shows mixed drinks at $10-11, wines around $10-13, and beer around $6-9. Currently, mixed drinks are $15, wines are mostly $15, and beers start at $9 for a Stiegl (which sells for less than $3 in a store). Last year it was already steep given the mixed drinks are in smaller-than-average glasses, but $15 is just too much; even at Valencia street's or the Embarcadero's fanciest restaurants (or Mourad, in the same building!), the cocktails are $11-13.\n\nI love the house-made charcuterie and staff revenue-sharing concept, the latter of which I understand usually raises the price of an average item. But it was already expensive before, and they've always included service. This latest increase just felt excessive without any discernible value-add.\n\nAs for the space itself: the design is lovely-looking, but there's hardly enough room between the bar and the tables. When I was seated recently, the host interrupted a group who'd been sitting on the edge of what became my table, but she didn't wipe it down. Those people continued to hover next to the table because there wasn't anywhere else for them to go. Not good for groups if you're just getting drinks without a reservation (we made one for precisely this reason). Additionally, because of their limited tables and permanent booths, smaller parties are often seated at the same table as other parties. \n\nThere's nothing terribly wrong with the food, service, or drinks, all of which are enjoyable. It's mostly that the price/quantity/value ratio doesn't compete, and I probably wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-06-05"}], "fritatta": [], "breakfast plate": [], "drip coffee": [], "cappuccino": [{"excerpts": ["A great cappuccino for any SF coffee snob."], "author": "Gina T.", "review": "Four Barrel Coffee.
