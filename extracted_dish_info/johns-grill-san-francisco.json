"], "author": "Steve L.", "review": "I've been hearing and reading about this place for years,  the legendary century-old institution featured in the Maltese Falcon.  I love historic places, and am a bit of a Bogart/Sam Spade/film noir fan, so I really wanted to check it out.  But every time I've been in the neighborhood, it was totally booked up.  Finally, on my latest trip to San Francisco, I got to try it, a couple of times.\n\nFirst visit, I met up with a friend for post-conference drinks after a long day at Moscone Center.  The place (or should I say \"the joint\") certainly looks its age.  From the vintage neon sign out front, to the dark, vaguely musty interior, John's Grill certainly feels historic.  In business since 1908, and apparently never altered since, it's all dark wood paneling, dark wood partition running down the middle, small and cramped, designed for those smaller people of that era, not for big 6'4\" lugs like me (sorry, my inner Spade is coming out).  Sure, I can definitely imagine Bogie/Sam Spade grabbing a drink or a bite here. The only addition over the years seems to be the ever-growing collection of B&W photos covering the walls, which range from scenes of post-1906-quake devastation to decades of celebrity patrons.  We sat at the bar, which wasn't exactly comfortable -- smallish, rickety, hard-edged old bar stools and no rail to rest your feet on -- but they served us excellent cocktails.  I had a French Gimlet, which is sort of a citrus-laced martini, my buddy an Old Fashioned, both notably good. \n\nSecond visit, I was on my own, my last night in town, and I went for a full dinner.  To submerse myself in the whole Sam Spade aura of the joint, I downloaded a copy of the original 1929 Dashiell Hammett novel, The Maltese Falcon, and read it while I ate.  Yup, there it is: \"...Right.  Have him pick me up at John's, Ellis Street, as soon as he can make it. ... He went to John's Grill, asked the waiter to hurry his order of chops, baked potato, and sliced tomatoes, ate hurriedly, and was smoking a cigarette with his coffee when a thick-set youngish  man with plaid cap set askew above pale eyes and a tough cheery face came into the Grill and to his table.\"  I wonder if it was my table. \n\nThe food is also old-school, the kind of stuff your grandparents would be comfortable ordering.  I started with a Dungeness Crab Cocktail, which turned out to be just a generous pile of crab meat with cocktail sauce in an ice-chilled dish  -- excellent, fresh, simple.  Then I had the Roquefort Salad (note: roquefort, not \"blue cheese.\" I remember my mom always used to order \"roquefort\" dressing, back when I was kid), which wasn't quite what I expected (cheese crumbles, not a creamy dressing) but still good.  My main dish was the Seafood Cioppino a la Marinara, which was also excellent.  The flavor was more old-style American than Italian, the tomato-based broth reminding me of Manhattan-style clam chowder, but it was loaded with all sorts of excellent seafood. Very tasty and satisfying.  I topped off the meal with the New York Cheesecake, which turned out not to be a massive wedge (fortunately), but a modest-sized hockey puck of cheesecake topped with berries -- just right, and one of the most delicious vanilla-laced cheesecakes I've ever tasted.\n\nSo yeah, even though it's a bit cramped and not particularly comfortable, stuffy in back and drafty by the door, I kinda like this joint.

I went to the Historic Johns Grill, open since 1908 and the home of the Maltese Falcon. When I arrived at the three-story building at 63 Ellis I learned from the host that it is one of the oldest and most famous establishments in San Francisco. Funny thing is, every time I have looked down Ellis (between Stockton and Powell) I have wondered what it was like inside because of the HOT location and traditional red awning...reading steaks, seafood, and cocktails.\n\nThe host was extremely friendly and with a beautiful smile he asked us where we would like to dine. We told him it did not matter. He suggested the upstairs where the guitar player would be and we agreed. As we walked through the restaurant, I noticed the plethora of past customers and celebrities covering the walls inch by inch. It was amazing...so many faces and names from Hillary Clinton to Clint Eastwood. We were escorted through a full house on the first floor to the second, which is known as The Maltese Falcon Room. The room is in honor of Author Dashiell Hammeett who used Johns Grill as a setting in his book. I also learned that Johns Grill is a National Literary landmark. I did not get a chance to see the third floor but maybe I can hold a private party there hmm  The furniture was totally original and from The old San Francisco. It provided an exquisite atmosphere to dine in. The host informed us of the specials for the evening before he departed our lovely table. Shortly after our waiter came over and asked us what we would like to drink and if we had any questions about the menu.\n\nCyril ordered the special house drink called the Bloody Brigid which came in a souvenir glass and it tasted SO delightful. Rene had a beer and I had a Bay Breeze. We started off with the Jumbo Prawns and Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($10.95). The nice sized portions came in the most adorable silver I have ever seen. The seafood was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder ($5.95) which I HIGHLY recommend. The soup was so splendid, it melted in my mouth and I groaned after every spoon full. For a salad we ordered the Seafood Florentine ($15.95) for two. The salad consists of fresh spinach, crab, shrimp, and special dressing. The dressing was light yet creamy, it was the perfect combination.\n\nFor our main course I ordered the Broiled Swordfish ($21.95) and they each ordered a steak (Filet Mignon ($26.95) and New York Cut Steak ($24.95). The slab of meat was the perfect size sitting next to a baked Idaho potato. The fish and steaks were just so full of flavor! To top it all off after unbuttoning my pants we had the White Chocolate Cheesecake ($5.95), Carmel Flan, and coffee. It was so yummyevery bite had my approval. The meal was just TO DIE FOR!

I went to the Historic Johns Grill, open since 1908 and the home of the Maltese Falcon. When I arrived at the three-story building at 63 Ellis I learned from the host that it is one of the oldest and most famous establishments in San Francisco. Funny thing is, every time I have looked down Ellis (between Stockton and Powell) I have wondered what it was like inside because of the HOT location and traditional red awning...reading steaks, seafood, and cocktails.\n\nThe host was extremely friendly and with a beautiful smile he asked us where we would like to dine. We told him it did not matter. He suggested the upstairs where the guitar player would be and we agreed. As we walked through the restaurant, I noticed the plethora of past customers and celebrities covering the walls inch by inch. It was amazing...so many faces and names from Hillary Clinton to Clint Eastwood. We were escorted through a full house on the first floor to the second, which is known as The Maltese Falcon Room. The room is in honor of Author Dashiell Hammeett who used Johns Grill as a setting in his book. I also learned that Johns Grill is a National Literary landmark. I did not get a chance to see the third floor but maybe I can hold a private party there hmm  The furniture was totally original and from The old San Francisco. It provided an exquisite atmosphere to dine in. The host informed us of the specials for the evening before he departed our lovely table. Shortly after our waiter came over and asked us what we would like to drink and if we had any questions about the menu.\n\nCyril ordered the special house drink called the Bloody Brigid which came in a souvenir glass and it tasted SO delightful. Rene had a beer and I had a Bay Breeze. We started off with the Jumbo Prawns and Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($10.95). The nice sized portions came in the most adorable silver I have ever seen. The seafood was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder ($5.95) which I HIGHLY recommend. The soup was so splendid, it melted in my mouth and I groaned after every spoon full. For a salad we ordered the Seafood Florentine ($15.95) for two. The salad consists of fresh spinach, crab, shrimp, and special dressing. The dressing was light yet creamy, it was the perfect combination.\n\nFor our main course I ordered the Broiled Swordfish ($21.95) and they each ordered a steak (Filet Mignon ($26.95) and New York Cut Steak ($24.95). The slab of meat was the perfect size sitting next to a baked Idaho potato. The fish and steaks were just so full of flavor!

This restaurant is about 25% cheaper than you would find at pretty much any other place in the area for the same quality. The dinner prices negate this value as they are pretty standard nighttime prices.\n\nThen the food. Foodies are definitely going to be disappointed. The menu, like all the great old-school restos left, hasn't changed in decades. And, yes this is a good thing. But old-school sometimes does not stand up to today's standards. For instance, the beef is cooked over direct open flame, so you get a lot more char on the steaks and burgers than you would normally expect. Cooked perfectly, just a lot of char. I'm not a big fan of this, but my dad loves it. My favorite dishes are the Jack LaLanne Salad, the clam chowder and the Crab Legs Supreme.

(This restaurant was featured in novels by Dashiell Hammett, such as the Maltese Falcon). \n\nEven though it was a Friday night, as it was early (around 5:30 pm), we had no trouble getting a table.  At this time only the first of three floors was in use. We were seated in a booth in the back; it was surrounded by photos of Dashiell Hammett and photos of historic San Francisco. \n\nMy son ordered Oysters Wellington.  He inquired if it was indeed an entree and not an appetizer and was assured that it was an entree and of sufficient quantity.  He was a bit disappointed to find that it was only three (but they were plumb) oysters, with each coated with pate and a puff pastry, in addition to string beans.  He felt that for the price of $23 there should have been more.  However, he did feel that the taste was excellent.\n\nI had Seafood Cannelloni ($21).  It was two large cannelloni that were stuffed with a very delicious mixture of seafood and covered with a very nice sauce.  (Also served with string beans). \n\nWe had very good service and an overall good experience.  A bit pricey for the portions, but it was a good before-the-symphony dinner. \n\nJohn's Grill is conveniently located near the Powell Street Bart/Muni station, one block up Powell and a half a block east on Ellis.

We were surrounded by Chinese and Indian food, but we had already met our fill of each so were looking for something a little different, but didn't know what.   We took to Yelp to figure out a place to eat and came across the reviews for John's Grill.   \n\nWhile we weren't keen on the price, the history and proximity caused us to decide to give John's Grill a try.  \n\nI love the signage for the building and the ambiance once inside makes you really think about the history and people who have dined in this space before you.  Oh, and about that space, it is a little cramped, but no more so than many restaurants we have dined at recently.   I liked that the tables were not set up bistro style so I didn't feel like I was sitting at my neighbors table, but I wasn't going to back up in my chair for fear of hitting the person sitting behind me.   The chairs were anything but comfortable and by the time we left my back was in such a knot I had to stop on the sidewalk to just take a moment to stretch.  \n\nAs I wanted to make sure I wasn't too full before my entree arrived, we decided to pass on any starters, but I did try a slice of bread.   It was sourdough bread.   Nothing remarkable about it.    \n\nMy husband ordered the ribeye steak with a side of creamed spinach.   Two of his favorite things.   It could be that I live in a place where beef is prevalent and our steaks are cut thick, but the steak was really thin, like thinner than the soles on my shoes thin.   He ordered it rare and he said that it couldn't have been much rarer.   I take that as a good sign.  He has eaten in a lot of steakhouses around the country and said that this was one of the better steaks he has had.    The creamed spinach also received positive reviews and I don't think I have ever heard him remark on the quality of the baked potato before, but this one caused him to take note.\n\nNow, I'm going to lose a few of you here, but I ordered the calves liver and onions.   One of my favorite meals when I was a kid (the liver without the onions that is).   The liver was prepared perfectly.   The mixed vegetables that were served with the meal really didn't do much for me.   I'm not a huge fan of snap peas and I can't stand cooked carrots.   I picked out the zucchini and yellow squash and called it good.   They could have used a little more cooking time, or been called a salad.   I, too, enjoyed the baked potato (though I didn't eat much of it as my stomach had reached capacity).   \n\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and checked back with us regularly.

After completing the on-line reservations, I called the restaurant directly, and spoke to a gentleman, confirming the reservation, I also, told him, it was my husband's birthday. I asked \"does the restaurant do anything special?\" His response, \"Oh, yes, we receive these requests all the time, no problem.\"\nWhen we arrived Sunday, October 2nd, after we were seated, I spoke to the hostess, and again, confirmed it was my husband's birthday, and something would be brought out, after our meal, \"of course, she said.\" We ordered our meal, the food was fair. The filet mignon was medium to medium well, even though my husband ordered medium rare. \nAfter dinner, our waiter came by, checked to see if we wanted dessert, I knew something special was going to be served, after all, I was reassured by 2 people, our waiter returned with the bill, but no dessert?\nI immediately excused myself, went to the hostess, asked, \"where was my husband's cake?\" she looked at me, and wasn't sure what to say. I then asked for the manager, he arrived, I explained, he acted like it was no big deal, even though the check was already delivered to our table, we could still have dessert, he clearly didn't understand. They delivered two small glasses of a sweet liquor and flan with a candle. At this point, the surprise was ruined. \nWhile our waiter was a very good waiter, because of this incident, how management discounted our experience and, the food which was not that good, I regretfully will not return back to this restaurant. There are far too many wonderful restaurants in the area.\n\nHusband UPDATE: We were contacted directly by the restaurant and we were given a name of someone to contact at the restaurant. We called and were quite impressed with deeply felt apologies from the contact. This contact went above and beyond to make the situation better. We are at this time comfortable with restaurant that we will be returning for a second chance. Everyone deserves a second chance. I will update the review after our return.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-10-04"}, {"excerpts": ["My filet mignon was well done when I ordered Med-rare.

I went to the Historic Johns Grill, open since 1908 and the home of the Maltese Falcon. When I arrived at the three-story building at 63 Ellis I learned from the host that it is one of the oldest and most famous establishments in San Francisco. Funny thing is, every time I have looked down Ellis (between Stockton and Powell) I have wondered what it was like inside because of the HOT location and traditional red awning...reading steaks, seafood, and cocktails.\n\nThe host was extremely friendly and with a beautiful smile he asked us where we would like to dine. We told him it did not matter. He suggested the upstairs where the guitar player would be and we agreed. As we walked through the restaurant, I noticed the plethora of past customers and celebrities covering the walls inch by inch. It was amazing...so many faces and names from Hillary Clinton to Clint Eastwood. We were escorted through a full house on the first floor to the second, which is known as The Maltese Falcon Room. The room is in honor of Author Dashiell Hammeett who used Johns Grill as a setting in his book. I also learned that Johns Grill is a National Literary landmark. I did not get a chance to see the third floor but maybe I can hold a private party there hmm  The furniture was totally original and from The old San Francisco. It provided an exquisite atmosphere to dine in. The host informed us of the specials for the evening before he departed our lovely table. Shortly after our waiter came over and asked us what we would like to drink and if we had any questions about the menu.\n\nCyril ordered the special house drink called the Bloody Brigid which came in a souvenir glass and it tasted SO delightful. Rene had a beer and I had a Bay Breeze. We started off with the Jumbo Prawns and Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($10.95). The nice sized portions came in the most adorable silver I have ever seen. The seafood was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder ($5.95) which I HIGHLY recommend. The soup was so splendid, it melted in my mouth and I groaned after every spoon full. For a salad we ordered the Seafood Florentine ($15.95) for two. The salad consists of fresh spinach, crab, shrimp, and special dressing. The dressing was light yet creamy, it was the perfect combination.\n\nFor our main course I ordered the Broiled Swordfish ($21.95) and they each ordered a steak (Filet Mignon ($26.95) and New York Cut Steak ($24.95). The slab of meat was the perfect size sitting next to a baked Idaho potato. The fish and steaks were just so full of flavor! To top it all off after unbuttoning my pants we had the White Chocolate Cheesecake ($5.95), Carmel Flan, and coffee. It was so yummyevery bite had my approval. The meal was just TO DIE FOR!

When we walked past this restaurant, a gentleman outside handed us a menu and asked if we wanted to come in for dinner. We had been wandering for awhile so this seemed like fate. The place does look like a nice anniversary dinner spot inside. Dark, intimate, fresh flowers on the table, and a romantic atmosphere. Except for the strong rotten fish odor that nearly knocks you out before you can sit down. Our waiter brought us cold, disgustingly sour sourdough bread with a very tough crust. The butter was frozen and would not spread, nor did it taste good. I thought those little foil wrapped bars of butter were only served in back alley truck stops in the middle of hick town. The waiter made no suggestions when he saw I was struggling to make a decision on a drink from the wine list. He huffed off. When he came back, he had a poor attitude. My husband ordered the bloody something or other signature drink. It was gross. I ordered the pomegranate cosmopolitan and after a 20 minute wait, my husband asked the waiter what happened to my drink and the waiter said they had to go get more pomegranate juice. Thanks for telling me that sooner, you know, I think for a $10 drink, you could at least let me know what's going on. The alcohol in the drink was a disaster! The alcohol made my lips, mouth, throat, and stomach instantly turn into a pit of fire. Even the slice of lime was a disgrace, more like a little square chunk. How do you screw up a lime slice so badly? FOR TEN BUCKS???? I tried a second drink and the fire only burned worse.
