Now, this quesadilla might have disappointed some people, since it contained only grilled chicken, cheddar cheese, and jack cheese, but, given my aforementioned lightweight status, I was very happy with it.  (For those of you who can handle more heat, there's always the option of dipping it in one of the salsas from their salsa bar.)\n\nThe place is small, so it can be a bit difficult to get between the tables when it's really busy.  Also, getting to the bathroom requires one to go through the kitchen, which I always hate doing because I feel like I'm in the way of the kitchen staff.  I'm not factoring those things into my rating, just noting them here for the benefit of others.\n\nI wouldn't compare the food here to that of a taqueria in the Mission; I think they're somewhat different beasts.

They're just \"eh.\"\n\nThe Borracho burrito though is awesome.  They put this so-called barbeque sauce in it, which mixes in perfectly with the black beans and rice to create a kind of gooey, oozy mound of deliciousness surrounded by the meat (I recommend carne asada over the chicken, but you can request carnitas too), cheese, and guacamole.  And the best part about it all is that they wrap it in a \"Chile tortilla\" which tastes incredible, and never comes unfolded, gets torn, or otherwise let you down and make a mess while you're eating.\n\nAs a testament to how good this burrito is, I went on a Pancho's binge a few months ago and ate at least 3 Borracho burritos a week for dinner for about a month.  I'm not joking, I would come home, sit on my couch, try to resist the craving, and end up going to Pancho's to get it.

First of all-Nick's does look like a brothel and is dark and dingy, as soon as you walk in.  It always has sticky floors, and what 's that fermented, damp-rag smell?  I'm always afraid to touch any surface in that place. The food at Nick's taste old, and you can tell there's no love in it's preparation adn it's always always slopped together.\n\nPancho's on the other hand has great food.  I have gone and ordered down the menu and have never been disappointed.  All their dishes are lovingly prepared, my favorite would have to be the taquitos dorados: three rolled corn tortillas filled with chicken, fried (but never greasy), served with lettuce cheese and rice and beans.  \n\nThe tacos are also very delicious, made to order, again with love.

Pancho's Salsa Bar is a fine place to get some Mexican food, particularly to-go, if you are living on this stretch of Polk Gulch.  It is also exceedingly unspectacular - which you can evaluate in different ways.  Unspectacular isn't necessarily bad.  It also means that this is not a place that you go out of your way to visit.  I have visited many times, though, because it is not bad at all and has a few nice features going in it's favor.\n\nSo, Pancho's is a chain but I don't believe that it is a big chain.  This location is on Polk Street as it transitioned over to the truly Nob Hill and then Russian Hill end of The City.  Pancho's is a pretty casual place with a nice vibe.  The food it pretty run of the mill, more on the end of a fast casual with a few entrees.  I think the menu is pretty limited relative to a more traditional Mexican place.  They have Burritos, and the options are listed out based on meat choices.  Same with Tacos.  Meat choices are Steak, Chicken, Carnitas and Shrimp.  So, not the big range.  They also offer about a half dozen entrees, such as Rolled Tacos, Tostadas (really should be called a Taco Salad), Tortas, Soup, Enchiladas and three combo platters.  All in all, not a ton of options.  You can't add a taco on the side.  The prices are in the $8/9 range for the Burritos and the $11 range for the entrees with meat.  \n\nI find the food to be a little bland and uninteresting.  Not bad, though.  I enjoy getting the Tostada (Taco Salad) even though I'd prefer less filler.  Rice in a Taco Salad?  The Burritos are just alright, however the Boracho Burrito with the sauce included it pretty tasty.  One of the Pancho's signatures is the homemade tortillas - I think that the Tacos are very bland, even with Guacamole.  You can load up at the Salsa Bar and flavor up your food if you want.  They have a nice little Salsa Bar.  One thing I will say is that I love that they always offer a $2 Tecate while you wait for your take out.  And again, the environment is nice enough.  I'll also add, I do have a few friends who like this place more than me - I'm not quite so crazy about it.  To be fair, you won't get awful food here, they have decent standards.  Just, not super interesting.  \n\nAll in all, I would not seek out the food, but I am happy to get it to-go since I live a few blocks away and this is the nice end of Polk Street.  But, I'd prefer the folks at El Super Burrito a few blocks closer to the Loin for food that is much more down home and flavorful.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-11-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I've tried their tostadas, quesadillas, tacos, even their torta ", "(I'm usually a huge torta fan wherever I go) but none of them is that good.

Truly nasty.  Then came my enchilada combination platter.  Oh boy.

Don't you make these to order?  No.  They are pre-made and frozen.  Lovely.  Literally the worst enchiladas I have ever had -- hardly any cheese, awkwardly hard tortilla, I could go on.  The beans and rice were terrible -- black beans, barely warm with a tiny bit of cheese sprinkled on top.  I think the moral of this story is simple: If you want to eat here (why for the love of god would you do such a thing?) you should just go with a burrito because it's impossible to screw up a burrito.  Alternatively, you could get down to the mission and eat good Mexican food.  It's somewhat ironic that my favorite and least favorite Mexican food spots in SF both have the word \"Pancho\" in their name.  \n\nOne positive: The chips were good.
