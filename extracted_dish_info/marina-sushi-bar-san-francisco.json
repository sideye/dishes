The salmon sashimi appetizer came out really cold in quite small slices. It wasn't that bad, but it compared badly to the sashimi you can get from nijaya supermarket.\n\nThe marina sushi bar roll was actually quite good. It was baked salmon on top of a crab and avocado roll.

They were very apologetic, and they explained  \"Oh, that happens because we leave the soy sauce holders next to these plants.\"  It's probably a sign that they should get fake plants. \n\nAnother roll involved tuna, shrimp and crab. That's basically what it said on the menu, they failed to add that they doused in garlic sauce.  That's fine if I'm feeling like garlic, but garlic isn't something I'm interested in when I'm getting sushi. It is possible that there was something wrong with the tuna which caused them to do this because my gf couldn't even bring herself to finish the spicy tuna handroll she ordered. My spicy scallop handroll tasted okay, but it was made so the bottom was a little soggy which was weird.\n\nI actually liked the other roll which had unagi and crab inside with some type of roe and a dash of hot sauce on top.\n\nThe service was quite decent, but without consistent quality food backing it up it is hard for that to add up to much.

Apparently, lots of sushi places are closed on Sundays!\n\nTo be honest, yet again, and a good thing for a restaurant review, too, I haven't had sushi since....oh I can't even remember. When was it? Last October? September? Back when I decided to go vegan... and then three months or so later, I missed cheese too much and went to just being vegetarian. Well, Sunday night I ate fish. Does that mean I'm a pescetarian now? No, I don't think so. Because sushi is a rare occasion for me because I'm not the kind of sushi lover to pick it up as a quick lunch from some questionable shop. No, I love to make eating sushi a grand experience, complete with the tea, the sake, tempura veggies, edamame, pot stickers, rolls upon rolls that foreshadow what my belly will look like, and nigiri, oh bring it on! So yes, I like my sushi to be an event. I like it to waltz into the room and dance on my table, do a pirouette into my wasabi soy sauce and dive into my mouth in one great mouthful. \n\nThis night was a little bit more laid back. No outlandish dancing slices of fish, but rather dipping of toes into a black pond of saltiness and re-experiencing the delicacy that  good sushi can be. I was slightly nervous at the quality of the fish when I first entered the restaurant. There wasn't even a chef behind the bar. Curious. There were two other tables occupied. Quiet and somber. Foreboding, even. And yet, the tuna and salmon practically melted in my mouth. The California roll was...it was the first time I noticed the cucumber crunching in my teeth! \n\nThe highlights of my night involved the buttery white tuna, the interesting flavor of the fried banana and sweet potato roll, miso soup at the end, and basically the entire enlightening re-encounter with raw fish.

That's basically what it said on the menu, they failed to add that they doused in garlic sauce.  That's fine if I'm feeling like garlic, but garlic isn't something I'm interested in when I'm getting sushi. It is possible that there was something wrong with the tuna which caused them to do this because my gf couldn't even bring herself to finish the spicy tuna handroll she ordered. My spicy scallop handroll tasted okay, but it was made so the bottom was a little soggy which was weird.\n\nI actually liked the other roll which had unagi and crab inside with some type of roe and a dash of hot sauce on top.\n\nThe service was quite decent, but without consistent quality food backing it up it is hard for that to add up to much. It would also be nice if the menu added more descriptions of what actually went into the rolls beyond the fish inside.

I really appreciate the fact that the soy sauce is the owner's original recipe.  It is very pleasantly fragrant and not overly salty like store bought soy.  Also, the miso soup is made with real benito flakes...how authentic is that?!  The owner Joyce is always gracious, accommodating, and hospitable.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly as well.  Great place to eat and you will leave feeling satisfied!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-09-27"}], "plum wine float": [], "tempura ice cream with banana": []}
