Known for its eclectic food--from taquerias to dosa places--the Mission is a mecca for unique flavors. However, working at an architecture firm, I often needed quick and easy meals on the go without compromising taste or nutrition. A co-worker suggested that I try Mission Picnic, and oh boy, I was not disappointed. \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the Picnic Club. Layers of tasty goodness: chicken, bacon, lettuce, cheese, pickles, mustard, and mayo. And the bread! No sandwich is complete without a freshly toasted bun. Mission Picnic offers a large selection of speciality sandwiches, unique to the store, of which you just have to try one of each. It also features other picnic items, such as salads, chips, blended juices, and cookies. Sandwich prices are a bit steep (about $9-$10 including tax), but Mission Picnic sandwiches make it up in deliciousness. You definitely aren't going to get a $5 footlong here (and why would you want to?)\n\nThe storefront is small with a few tables and chairs, but its presence is very strong. With its hand written menu and funky decor, it's represents the Mission very well.\n\nI was in the Mission today and wanted to visit all the food places I missed while I was away. One of the first to come to mind was Mission Picnic. Per usual, I ordered the Picnic Club and it was as delicious as I remembered. The counter server was Kathleen--one of the sweetest girls you'll ever meet. My sandwich was prepared by Sterling, the owner, a sandwich connoisseur, and, I must say, a little bit of a flirt. Also, shout out to Brian who was counting the till as I was complimenting the staff.\n\nBeing back at Mission Picnic reminded me of how small businesses can have a strong impact on a community. A sandwich is just a sandwich until it represents something more. Food is much more than about sustenance; it's about an experience. \n\nSo if you're hankering for a really, really good sandwich in the Mission District, scoot your butt to 22nd Street between Valencia and Mission, grab yourself a sandwich, have a picnic in Dolores Park, and enjoy!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-10-12"}, {"excerpts": ["on brioche, Picnic Club (chicken with chipotle) on ciabatta and Hainan Chicken on dutch crunch.\n\n", "So instead I ordered his recommendation (his most confident dish like The Taste show) and had the Picnic Club.\n\n"], "author": "T L.", "review": "(See pics) Review #1351.Sandwich is more 3.5 stars. The 4 stars is because of the dessert.\n\nWhat was once popular Corazon Juicebar (there were people coming in looking for the old place) now is a sandwich shop. No sign until Friday (3/28) as they are really trying to test out their menus WITHOUT too much publicity.\n\nI really think the owner has a kick in making DESSERTS more than the sandwiches and that is why reviewing the dessert first as it's the real highlight!\n\nSterling has recently lived in France so this looks like a dream extension. Every dessert is made by him and as he mentioned (yeah sorry I was skeptical), it's the lighter sweet kind! They looked so very pretty and meticulously elegant, from tiramisu to chocolate, to fruit tarts. All were lovely and I had the strawberry cake and must say the aroma bursts out through the creamy silkness! If they would only add the coffee drink or tea, it will be a perfect afternoon spot or after dinner place to relax.\n\nOnto the sandwiches, they have a handful selection including Devil's Eggs on deli white (suggested it would be a real nice appetizer), Mozzapesto on focaccia, San Franciscon (west coast style pastrami with provolone) on rustic French, The King (only sweet sandwich with peanut butter, banana, honey, chocolate, frosted flakes!) on brioche, Picnic Club (chicken with chipotle) on ciabatta and Hainan Chicken on dutch crunch.\n\nWas totally eying the Hainan chicken but that was the one not recommended. The owner, Sterling, said if you are Chinese and had the Hainan chicken back home, you would find it to be not like that. Asked if maybe there was a twist to his recipe and it was said to still be perfected. So instead I ordered his recommendation (his most confident dish like The Taste show) and had the Picnic Club.\n\nThe chicken was decently 3.35 stars but the good substantial size made it up to 3.5 stars. It's $8.5 but paid half price as everything is (drinks and food) until Friday night during their soft opening. The little bacon bites were with a tingle of sweetness and a nice touch of crunchiness. It was also packed with mustard, lettuce and tomato, the standard. Did sincerely suggested that every sandwich has to be good and not just 1 or 2 signatures in the long run and look forward to the future visits.\n\nThey also made quiches in house. So many choices in such a small place!\n\nAnother major high point is they are currently open until 8pm and midnight on the weekends. This is bound to change to also open until midnight during the week. Considering Revolution is just around the corner and the shop is in between 2 major, major streets of late night establishments, or if you just live in the hood, having a bite here is a refreshing new option comparing with the bacon wrapped hot dogs and pizza, as one patron excitedly pointed out about the choice of switching out pizzas.\n\nThe peeps here were super friendly, like Mission genuine friendly, and the business partner who came in a bit later was also a nice chap checking and preparing more decorations and chit chatted with customers.\n\nDo want to see when this tiny shop expands to include next door office space, as well as other choices of sandwiches such as anchovy with capers (would be a definite to try.)\n\nGrand opening is this Saturday and if you are into vodka they are planning on having a party serving that with other refreshments and food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The Picnic Club -  There rendition of the club sandwich.

The avocado/jalapeno aioli and dijon all folded into a yummy flavor. I didn't taste the roasted pork but the ham was good. Pineapple dominated the flavor so maybe they could put more meat?\n\n*Hainan Chicken: this one, served on a rustic French roll, is almost twice the side of the Cubano. \"Hainan\" is really \"Ayam\" from Malay, meaning chicken. Ayam became Hainan when the boiled chicken dish came to China. Anyway, the Hainan chicken sandwich here doesn't come with the usual ginger, but a garlicky butter and scallion oil. Maybe they should consider a crushed ginger dip like that you get from a Chinese deli?

The sandwiches are mostly traditional, with a bit of an interesting flair - the most popular and talked about is the Hainan Chicken sandwich. I wanted to try something different. \n\nThe San Franciscan (~$9.50) was screaming my name, with ingredients like Pastrami, Turkey, Pepperocini's.... and it was delicious! The combination of quality ingredients sandwiched between some amazing Semifreddo's French Bread made this an amazing sandwich. I just wish there was more meat (in general) on all of these sandwiches. \n\nMission Picnic is better than most of it's popular neighborhood competitors, like Rhea's, Pal's Takeaway, and Ike's (whoa, I said it). Nothing in the area is quite like it, but in terms of delivering an amazing pastrami, I think I still like the Sandwich Place and Marina Subs. In terms of top notch quality ingredient sandwich, my heart is still with Salumeria and Roli Roti. For something really different, I enjoy options at Bite Me. \n\nI'm a sandwich snob, and yet with so many options in the neighborhood, I would recommend stopping at Mission Picnic for your Dolores Park supplies.

Something about the simply boiled chicken, deliciously oily rice and aromatic m\u00e9nage a trios of sauces (chili, ginger and dark soy) makes me...uhh, makes me happy. Sorry, going to keep it PG-rated for once.\n\nSo naturally seeing the Hainan Chicken Sandwich on Mission Picnic's FB page almost made me keel over. A FOBanese American Sandwich? I'm all over it! I hoped into my imaginary rice rocket and vroomed vroomed my way to Mission Picnic yesterday while bumping to Stevie B.\n\nMission Picnic is a new sandwich shop serving seasonal sandwiches; some with an Asian twist. They're currently in their soft opening stage and have an awesome deal of 50% off your purchase (till today). Their Grand Opening is tomorrow.\n\nFormerly the Corazon Juice Bar, Mission Picnic is a tiny shop with just four two-top tables so this is more of a to-go place.\n\nFor their soft opening, they had 6 sandwiches available (~$8-9):\n*Picnic Club (Rotisserie chicken salad w/ bacon & cheddar)\n*Hainan Chicken (Garlic rotisserie chicken w/ cucumber & picnic spread)\n*San Franciscan (Hot pastrami, turkey & provolone)\n*Devil's Egg (Market boiled egg, bacon & provolone)\n*MozzaPesto (Mozzarella, basil, tomato & pesto aioli)\n*The King (Peanut butter, bananas, honey chocolate & frosted flakes).\n\nThey'll also have soups and salads in the future. \n\nMake sure to try one of their refreshing fruit shakes (pineapple, watermelon or strawberry - $2.75). I had the watermelon which was more like a fresh watermelon juice slushy but it was really good (no sugar added).\n\nCASH ONLY.\n\nThe Hainan Chicken Sandwich was nicely packed with tenderly moist garlic rotisserie chicken, sliced cucumbers, tomato, lettuce & picnic spread on dutch crunch: http://bit.ly/171yYMd. The picnic spread of garlic and parsley was slathered onto the bread before toasting so all that garlicky goodness soaked into every nook and cranny. So yummy!\n\nWhile the sandwich was solid and made with top-notch ingredients, it was more like a garlic pesto-ish chicken sandwich to me. I was hoping it would be more FOBanese. There was no ginger in the spread and ginger is what makes hainan chicken \"hainan\" imo. And, although the dutch crunch had a deliciously crunchy mottled crust, I think a less carb heavy bread like a baguette would let the ingredients shine for this particular sandwich. Just my two cents.\n\nOne of owners, Sterling was super nice and encouraged customer feedback which is always a sign to build customer loyalty and remain competitive in this marketplace. I hope he does see this and offers several FOBanese sandwich options in the future including vegan options for my Yelpie friend John B.  who's always in the hood and for all the surrounding PBR drinking and camel toe inducing skinny jean lovers of course.\n\nMission Picnic has a lot of potential and this was just their soft opening so I can't wait to see what other specialty sandwich ideas they have up their sleeve...\n\nPerhaps a pulled pork with apple wasabi slaw sandwich, a Tonton sesame marinated tofu w/ portobello mushroom sandwich, a longanisa banh mi or a loco moco sloppy joe? I can go on and on.\n\nNow only if I can come up with ideas like that in my field of work instead of looking like a deer caught in headlights all the time...", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-28"}, {"excerpts": ["My wife got the Mozzapesto, which she said was fantastic."], "author": "Benjamin T.", "review": "Very tasty sandwiches and friendly waitstaff.

The 4 stars is because of the dessert.\n\nWhat was once popular Corazon Juicebar (there were people coming in looking for the old place) now is a sandwich shop. No sign until Friday (3/28) as they are really trying to test out their menus WITHOUT too much publicity.\n\nI really think the owner has a kick in making DESSERTS more than the sandwiches and that is why reviewing the dessert first as it's the real highlight!\n\nSterling has recently lived in France so this looks like a dream extension. Every dessert is made by him and as he mentioned (yeah sorry I was skeptical), it's the lighter sweet kind! They looked so very pretty and meticulously elegant, from tiramisu to chocolate, to fruit tarts. All were lovely and I had the strawberry cake and must say the aroma bursts out through the creamy silkness! If they would only add the coffee drink or tea, it will be a perfect afternoon spot or after dinner place to relax.\n\nOnto the sandwiches, they have a handful selection including Devil's Eggs on deli white (suggested it would be a real nice appetizer), Mozzapesto on focaccia, San Franciscon (west coast style pastrami with provolone) on rustic French, The King (only sweet sandwich with peanut butter, banana, honey, chocolate, frosted flakes!) on brioche, Picnic Club (chicken with chipotle) on ciabatta and Hainan Chicken on dutch crunch.\n\nWas totally eying the Hainan chicken but that was the one not recommended. The owner, Sterling, said if you are Chinese and had the Hainan chicken back home, you would find it to be not like that. Asked if maybe there was a twist to his recipe and it was said to still be perfected. So instead I ordered his recommendation (his most confident dish like The Taste show) and had the Picnic Club.\n\nThe chicken was decently 3.35 stars but the good substantial size made it up to 3.5 stars. It's $8.5 but paid half price as everything is (drinks and food) until Friday night during their soft opening. The little bacon bites were with a tingle of sweetness and a nice touch of crunchiness. It was also packed with mustard, lettuce and tomato, the standard. Did sincerely suggested that every sandwich has to be good and not just 1 or 2 signatures in the long run and look forward to the future visits.\n\nThey also made quiches in house. So many choices in such a small place!\n\nAnother major high point is they are currently open until 8pm and midnight on the weekends. This is bound to change to also open until midnight during the week. Considering Revolution is just around the corner and the shop is in between 2 major, major streets of late night establishments, or if you just live in the hood, having a bite here is a refreshing new option comparing with the bacon wrapped hot dogs and pizza, as one patron excitedly pointed out about the choice of switching out pizzas.\n\nThe peeps here were super friendly, like Mission genuine friendly, and the business partner who came in a bit later was also a nice chap checking and preparing more decorations and chit chatted with customers.\n\nDo want to see when this tiny shop expands to include next door office space, as well as other choices of sandwiches such as anchovy with capers (would be a definite to try.)\n\nGrand opening is this Saturday and if you are into vodka they are planning on having a party serving that with other refreshments and food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-03-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the mozzapesto, it was good.

After a few minutes of deliberation, my friend and I decided on two to share:\n\n*Nuevo Cubano: roasted pork and black forest ham with red pickled onion, a slice of pineapple on a crispy ciabatta. The avocado/jalapeno aioli and dijon all folded into a yummy flavor. I didn't taste the roasted pork but the ham was good. Pineapple dominated the flavor so maybe they could put more meat?\n\n*Hainan Chicken: this one, served on a rustic French roll, is almost twice the side of the Cubano. \"Hainan\" is really \"Ayam\" from Malay, meaning chicken. Ayam became Hainan when the boiled chicken dish came to China. Anyway, the Hainan chicken sandwich here doesn't come with the usual ginger, but a garlicky butter and scallion oil. Maybe they should consider a crushed ginger dip like that you get from a Chinese deli? The chicken is simply boiled but very tender and moist, unlike the usual leathery, rubbery texture of deli chicken. The assembly, complete with cilantro, sliced tomato and cucumber, looked a bit like a bunh mi. \n\nWe were also tempted by their special creation of the day: a French Toast sandwich with lumps of strawberries powdered sugar. But we were too full to have a go at dessert. They also have a PBJ sandwich, as well as a Salami plate. Guilty of having too much carbs? Get the Peach and Avocado salad.\n\nSo many possibilities here at Mission Picnic even though they don't offer katsu, the staple of Rhea down the street. They also allowed substitution.

Their Grand Opening is tomorrow.\n\nFormerly the Corazon Juice Bar, Mission Picnic is a tiny shop with just four two-top tables so this is more of a to-go place.\n\nFor their soft opening, they had 6 sandwiches available (~$8-9):\n*Picnic Club (Rotisserie chicken salad w/ bacon & cheddar)\n*Hainan Chicken (Garlic rotisserie chicken w/ cucumber & picnic spread)\n*San Franciscan (Hot pastrami, turkey & provolone)\n*Devil's Egg (Market boiled egg, bacon & provolone)\n*MozzaPesto (Mozzarella, basil, tomato & pesto aioli)\n*The King (Peanut butter, bananas, honey chocolate & frosted flakes).\n\nThey'll also have soups and salads in the future. \n\nMake sure to try one of their refreshing fruit shakes (pineapple, watermelon or strawberry - $2.75). I had the watermelon which was more like a fresh watermelon juice slushy but it was really good (no sugar added).\n\nCASH ONLY.\n\nThe Hainan Chicken Sandwich was nicely packed with tenderly moist garlic rotisserie chicken, sliced cucumbers, tomato, lettuce & picnic spread on dutch crunch: http://bit.ly/171yYMd. The picnic spread of garlic and parsley was slathered onto the bread before toasting so all that garlicky goodness soaked into every nook and cranny. So yummy!\n\nWhile the sandwich was solid and made with top-notch ingredients, it was more like a garlic pesto-ish chicken sandwich to me. I was hoping it would be more FOBanese. There was no ginger in the spread and ginger is what makes hainan chicken \"hainan\" imo. And, although the dutch crunch had a deliciously crunchy mottled crust, I think a less carb heavy bread like a baguette would let the ingredients shine for this particular sandwich. Just my two cents.\n\nOne of owners, Sterling was super nice and encouraged customer feedback which is always a sign to build customer loyalty and remain competitive in this marketplace. I hope he does see this and offers several FOBanese sandwich options in the future including vegan options for my Yelpie friend John B.  who's always in the hood and for all the surrounding PBR drinking and camel toe inducing skinny jean lovers of course.\n\nMission Picnic has a lot of potential and this was just their soft opening so I can't wait to see what other specialty sandwich ideas they have up their sleeve...\n\nPerhaps a pulled pork with apple wasabi slaw sandwich, a Tonton sesame marinated tofu w/ portobello mushroom sandwich, a longanisa banh mi or a loco moco sloppy joe?

Was also in need of a place to charge my phone and appreciated all of the outlets.\n\nI got the CranTurkey Sandwich and it was YUMMY! At first I was a little put off by the thickness of the bread, it looked huge, but then I tasted the bread. So worth the calories! It tasted like a little butter in every bite, which complemented the CranTurkey goodness. Ate the whole thing and had to have a late dinner because of it but was worth it!\n\nAlso enjoyed the watermelon juice, which has no sugar or junk added to it.

It has everything.  Creative yet intuitive flavors, friendly staff, chutes, ladders, the outdoor concert from a Zoloft commercial...\n\nSorry, I couldn't resist.  Anyway, I went today and ordered the Sgt. Slawter, and it was definitely in my top 20 sandwiches of all time (which is really saying something for me!).  It was the perfect combination of textures and flavors, juicy but not enough to make the bread soggy.  The teriyaki slaw with roast beef is brilliant, particularly when paired with dutch crunch and a garlic/herb spread.  The meat was exceptional: very thin and juicy with some real flavor.  This is some high-quality stuff, not your typical grocery-store cold cuts.\n\nPreviously, I've ordered the Hainan Chicken, which was good but didn't blow my mind like the Slawter did.\n\nMy only hang-up is the price.  It's just hard for me to justify spending $8.50 on a sandwich, even when it is amazing.  This is the only reason I won't be eating at Mission Picnic on a daily basis.  I'm not saying it's overpriced, just that it's too expensive for me to eat here as regularly as I'd like.  \n\nYou can really tell that the food here is made with care and quality ingredients.  I haven't seen such inventive and new flavor pairings in a sandwich shop, and I've eaten a lot of sandwiches.  The bottom line: go, and get the Sgt. Slawter.

One sandwich that definitely stood out was their Hainan Chicken sandwich (we also tried their Picnic club, Devil's egg, and San Franciscan).  What made the Hainan different was that it had an Asian flair to it, but made modern into a sandwich.
