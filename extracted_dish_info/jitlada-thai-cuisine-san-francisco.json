Very unpleasant.  One of my friends is vegan, so naturally, she had some questions about how the food was prepared.  Every time she started asking a question, our server cut her off and assured that the kitchen would make her dish \"without meat.\"  \r\n\r\nOur server was also very pushy.  She tried to sneak in an appetizer that no one ordered.  When we told her we wanted to dine \"family style\" and ordered a total of 8 entrees (to split between the 9 of us), she complained that we didn't order enough dishes.  She informed us in a haughty tone of voice that she was willing to \"let us do it this time,\" but \"just so we know in the future\" it is house policy to order at least as many dishes as the number of people dining.  \r\n\r\nFirst of all, let me point out that nowhere on the menu does it state such a \"policy.\"  And secondly, there will be no \"future\" visits.  I mean, what a stupid thing to say in front of a large party!  At our table were 9 customers, all of whom she just made very uncomfortable.

I also cook my own food at home and know how difficult it can be to prepare vegetables well.  This entree sounds simple, but the vegetables were all expertly cooked.  The pumpkin was not undercooked but not falling apart either, mushrooms were not rubbery but tender and delicious, the peas were light and crisp, and the sauce was not too overbearing and helped the flavor of the vegetables shine.  It was an excellent balance of flavor and texture.\n\nThe price, as well, was very reasonable.  I paid $30 for an entree, an appetizer, and a beer.  While it's not the cheapest Thai food around, I feel the quality and service are at least two notches above the baseline, while the price is just one notch.\n\nThe decor isn't the trendiest around, but it's clean and simple and I can tell a lot of thought was put into it.

Very unpleasant.  One of my friends is vegan, so naturally, she had some questions about how the food was prepared.  Every time she started asking a question, our server cut her off and assured that the kitchen would make her dish \"without meat.\"  \r\n\r\nOur server was also very pushy.  She tried to sneak in an appetizer that no one ordered.  When we told her we wanted to dine \"family style\" and ordered a total of 8 entrees (to split between the 9 of us), she complained that we didn't order enough dishes.  She informed us in a haughty tone of voice that she was willing to \"let us do it this time,\" but \"just so we know in the future\" it is house policy to order at least as many dishes as the number of people dining.  \r\n\r\nFirst of all, let me point out that nowhere on the menu does it state such a \"policy.\"  And secondly, there will be no \"future\" visits.

I sincerely hope this woman is not Chef Pai!\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, several of the dishes we ordered were inventive.  The stuffed basil eggplant appetizer, the pumpkin curry, and the evil princess were all delicious.  That being said, there is NO EXCUSE for rude, pushy service.
