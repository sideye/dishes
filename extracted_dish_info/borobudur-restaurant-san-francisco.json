The lemongrass soup - it was ok, Mingalaba in Burlingame makes a better lemongrass soup imo. \n\n2. Beef Rendang - the coconut adds a nice smoothness - the beef was tender - our groups consensus favorite. Move over Thai Penang curry, I have a new favorite. \n\n3. BBQ Marinated spicy chicken in special chili sauce - Our group's # 2 favorite dish - the special chili sauce tasted like Mae Ploy. I could replicate this dish at home.  \n\n3. Bakmi Goreng aka Stir fried egg noodle dish - It was aiiight - basically chow mein \n\n4. Ikan Bakar Samudra aka grilled trout fish - This tasted like Indonesia.

I would have been fine with the subtle eye contact from one of the servers (this place has no host/ess) with a smile and the thought \"I see you standing there and I know you're waiting to be seated.

It was almost as if they were trying to avoid looking at us as if saying \"if we don't look at them, maybe they'll leave...\" \n\nFinally we walked over to the only available table. A waiter was passing us so I said \"Do you mind if we sit here?\" And he barked \"HOLD ON!\"  Did you ever watch Martin? You know Sheneneh? Well... I almost wanted to bust a Sheneneh and bob my head and snap my fingers and say \"Oh no you din't....\" \n\nThe waiter breezed past us, seemingly angry. Eh... Whatever.. We sat down. He came over a few minutes later and put another place setting down for us, since our table only had one. He then slammed my fork and spoon down on the table... No idea why he was so angry.\n\nWe wait about 10 mins and no one ever comes to take our order. We finally flag down another one of the 3 servers. He was the saving grace for this restaurant. I think I've only walked out of a restaurant once. Working in food service has made me extremely patient and tolerant when it comes to dining out. But there's only so much incompetence I can take.

The coconut curry was lacking heat and the veggies could have used a few more minutes in the pot; they were a bit toothsome for my taste.

Luckily, we reserved a spot for our large group because there was one more reservations that was larger than ours that came at the same time. I am a fan of Indonesian food, and since I've been to many indo restaurants as well as eaten a lot of my family's cooking, I am very picky. It's safe to say that I'd come back here if I was in the area. We ordered a lot of dishes, all had large portions and they all tasted pretty well. FYI, I've been to Indonesia and have tried legit indo food, so I'm very picky and critical.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered 3 orders of ground beef Martabak Sapi. Wow were they big! It was pretty tasty and filling. The ground beef was a bit dry, but luckily the rest of the ingredients weren't. It's a great appetizer to share with others, but I'd suggest only eating one or two pieces or else you're going to get full easily.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of my favorite Indonesian dish, beef rendang. The beef was amazingly tender, and it wasn't too dry, but the flavors weren't that strong. The sauce usually has stronger spices for flavor and spiciness. That's what I love about it. Unfortunately, this was definitely my favorite rendang. \n\nWe ordered two orders of Soto betawi, an Indonesian coconut soup with beef, cabbage, potato & tomato. It was pretty tasty, but again, didn't have enough flavor as I'm used to. At least the potatoes, tomatoes, and other dishes were soft and easy to eat. I was just happy that I got to have some for my meal.\n\nI was surprised to see honey chicken on the menu, and have never tried it at an Indonesian restaurant, so we ordered 3 orders of it. The chicken was sweet! I loved it! I love honey and I love chicken, so this combo just made my day! I enjoyed the honey cooked onto the chicken to perfection. To me, it felt like the honey definitely stuck on the chicken well.\n\nLastly, we ordered 3 dishes of some carbs: Nasi Goreng (regular Indonesian fried rice for those who cannot take spicy food, Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas (tTraditional spicy shrimp paste fried rice with egg, onion), and Bakmi Goreng (stir fried egg noodle with egg & vegetables), all with chicken. All were tasty with the spices and ingredients, but I loved the Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas the most. I like spicy and I LOVE Nasi Goreng (fried rice)!!\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 since my favorite Indonesian dishes weren't that great at this restaurant. I'll give it another 0.5 stars for the great and friendly service.\n\nTip: Order family-style so you can try different dishes.

We came on Tuesday night at around 6:30 PM. There was no wait as there were only 2 other tables filled.\n\nFOOD:\n*Martabak Sapi (Ground beef with egg & onion in crispy dough): It was just meh. We expected something more of a samosa filled with stir-fried ground beef. What we got was a steamed Viet-like meatloaf wrapped in a wonton wrapper and fried. The filling itself was quite bland.\n\n*Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce): The chicken was very flavorful and was fork tender. What made the dish was the sauce. You can tell the sauce was a result of a slow reduction of the coconut milk and spices braising the chicken which produced a very flavorful and rich sauce. I love spicy foods, and this dish has the right amount of kick from the chili, ginger, and other spices. \n\n*Rendang (Beef cooked with coconut milk in spice): The BEST dish of the night. Normally, I'm use to Rendang in a coconut curry sauce. Borobudor's Rendang is covered in a very thick coconut spicy sauce. The huge chunks of beef were SUPER tender and broke apart easily with a fork. Just like the chicken, the beef was braised slowly in the coconut milk and spice concoction which produced a very flavorful, thick, and rich sauce which glued to the beef. This with rice....*Drool*\n\n*Mie Tek Tek (Stir-fried noodle with chicken, egg and vegetables): We ordered this dish after all the rave reviews on YELP; but I have to say it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was basically Pad See Ew made with chow mein noodles. Although the dish itself had great flavor from the garlic, soy sauce, sugar, and other spices; the noodles were a bit mushy and the chicken breast strips were very bland and dry. \n\nSERVICE: Borobudor's service is slow, very very slow. We ordered at 6:45 pm and didn't get our appetizer until 7:18 pm. All this time while waiting for our appetizer, 5 parties who arrived and ordered AFTER us, all received their appetizers and main entrees before us. Ok, something is wrong with this picture!!! Needless to say, we were highly frustrated and was very close to walking out the door. \n\nAfter receiving our food, they never checked on us and we had to flag them down when we needed hot sauce or more napkins. \n\nService can make or break your restaurant experience.

(There's no shortage of Thai and Vietnamese though!) For this reason, I really wanted to like Borobudur. Having been here on several occasions, I've been able to try most of the appetizers, both soups, two shrimp dishes, two beef dishes, the saut\u00e9ed garlic water spinach, the nasi goreng, three noodle dishes, and three desserts (see pictures). I was sad to find that nothing really wowed me, with the exception of two desserts. (I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so when dessert is the best part of the meal for me, it usually doesn't bode well for the savoury stuff!)\n\nOf all the appetizers I've had, the three that I would order again are the roti, martabak, and empek empek palembang.

Both are flavourful and loaded with chicken and vegetables. While the coconut curry soup wasn't the best I've had, it's still worth a try. The other soups were also pretty good and I'll likely order them again (mostly because I can't find them anywhere else!), but I wouldn't repeat the beef or shrimp dishes I had.\n\nFor dessert, I love the BLACK SWEET RICE WITH COCONUT MILK and roti prata manis. The black sweet rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=cK_5RuC3hkPcLwPc8GWsZg) has a chocolate-y flavour and the bits of sweet rice add texture. It's better served hot so be sure to ask them to heat it up (it was barely lukewarm both times I got it). The ROTI PRATA MANIS (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=imC4Q1hWGKXTcDqOE5aWAQ) is filled with condensed milk, ground peanut, chocolate, and cheese. Yup, you read that right - cheese. CHEDDAR cheese, to be exact (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=uLo6Zw-XuCaIIunwSg6YBQ). Some people top their apple pie with a slice of cheddar, so I suppose this isn't that out there. Surprisingly, this dish worked out amazingly. The cheddar wasn't too strong but added a hint of saltiness along with the peanuts to balance out the sweetness. It also added a creaminess to the dish. Paired with the crispy/chewy roti, this is hands down my favourite dish here.\n\nStay away from the fried banana though! Instead of a coating that is thin and crispy, it's thick, doughy, and mushy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=kNCzXgZ0JJxc98Y5uB0Q7A).

The eggplant retained its bright purple exterior skin and contrasted so well among the tofu and green beans. The dish was visually stunning and equally tasty. However, be forewarned that this one is SPICY. The dish is doused with a chili sauce. Those two chili symbols next to the entree are no joke.\n- nasi udak/aromatic rice: Instead of the typical white, brown, coconut rice options, we opted for the aromatic rice that was cooked with coconut and lemongrass flavors. It was most definitely aromatic and delicious! While the lemongrass was extremely apparent in the flavor, the coconut a little less so.\n\nWhile we had no room for dessert, Borobudur was a fantastic experience in Indonesian cuisine!

(There's no shortage of Thai and Vietnamese though!) For this reason, I really wanted to like Borobudur. Having been here on several occasions, I've been able to try most of the appetizers, both soups, two shrimp dishes, two beef dishes, the saut\u00e9ed garlic water spinach, the nasi goreng, three noodle dishes, and three desserts (see pictures). I was sad to find that nothing really wowed me, with the exception of two desserts. (I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so when dessert is the best part of the meal for me, it usually doesn't bode well for the savoury stuff!)\n\nOf all the appetizers I've had, the three that I would order again are the roti, martabak, and empek empek palembang. The ROTI (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=rzkH1HTiuaZLCdv8H4PGEw) is crispy on the outside with soft layers on the inside, but at $7.50 is pricey for what it is.

Both are flavourful and loaded with chicken and vegetables. While the coconut curry soup wasn't the best I've had, it's still worth a try. The other soups were also pretty good and I'll likely order them again (mostly because I can't find them anywhere else!), but I wouldn't repeat the beef or shrimp dishes I had.\n\nFor dessert, I love the BLACK SWEET RICE WITH COCONUT MILK and roti prata manis. The black sweet rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=cK_5RuC3hkPcLwPc8GWsZg) has a chocolate-y flavour and the bits of sweet rice add texture. It's better served hot so be sure to ask them to heat it up (it was barely lukewarm both times I got it). The ROTI PRATA MANIS (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=imC4Q1hWGKXTcDqOE5aWAQ) is filled with condensed milk, ground peanut, chocolate, and cheese. Yup, you read that right - cheese. CHEDDAR cheese, to be exact (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=uLo6Zw-XuCaIIunwSg6YBQ). Some people top their apple pie with a slice of cheddar, so I suppose this isn't that out there. Surprisingly, this dish worked out amazingly. The cheddar wasn't too strong but added a hint of saltiness along with the peanuts to balance out the sweetness. It also added a creaminess to the dish.

We found the young waitress to be personable and friendly, as well as her Father (?).  We also noticed the small restaurant filled up very quickly and then the few servers scrambled to get good service to everyone.  My suggestion is always make a reservation, come early for dinner, and order fairly quickly to beat the rush. We ordered #57:Mie Tek Tek Goreng. which were egg noodles with a rich, spicy sauce.  How delicious!!! We couldn't get enough of so we had to order a second dish of the same to share (not a big portion).  I believe we got the #53: Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas fried rice because the waitress asked if we wanted it very spicy and if we liked shrimp paste, which matches the description on their online menu.  It was soooo spicy that it became painful to eat.  However the pain wasn't enough to stop us from taking bite after bite and serving ourselves more of this generously portioned side dish.  I wish I had ordered the Roti but I forgot. \n\nThe #30 Beef Rendang consisted of several huge chunks of tender beef in a dark, thick, rich, spicy coconut sauce.  It didn't look like much but due to the richness of the sauce we couldn't even finish it.  It wasn't as good as the Honey Chicken which consisted of about 4 medium sized pieces (legs/thighs etc.), but I'm glad we ordered both.  The Honey Chicken didn't have a sticky coating as I expected but simply a sweet flavor surrounding (grilled or BBQ'd?) chicken which was moist and fork tender. Again I wish there had been a larger portion but at least we ordered enough dishes to share with eachother.  Our last dish was #42 Tumis Buncis Pedas Udang Kering or spicy, salty green beans with dried shrimp.  They were delicious and a nice offset to the other dishes.  \n\nI would have passed on the appetizer: #9: Siomay Ayam (goreng/kukus) or steamed chicken dumplings mixed w/seafood in a spicy peanut dipping sauce.  The six small bite-sized, oddly textured morsels were not justified of the price although the sauce was good.  I also felt #21. Pisang Bakar Keju or deep fried plantain wrapped in wonton skin and covered with cheese and chocolate sauce was an abomination of a dish.  WTF were they thinking here?  I expected an Indian Paneer-type cheese but they covered a barely edible plantain with shredded cheddar cheese which did not go at all with the chocolate sauce.  Oh well, #27: Es Campur was sold out but #26: Es Teler was a refreshing shaved ice desert which was too small to share by more than 2 people and quickly devoured!  The other fried plantain and ice cream desert was fine.  The bill was well over $100 but the food was unique and well executed and we enjoyed the service very much.

Most of their dishes are intense and robust exuding vibrant and zesty flavors. Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

"], "author": "Ty T.", "review": "7-September, Saturday\n The rice table (or Dutch 'Rijsttafel') was an elaborate meal of Indonesian dishes developed during the Dutch colonial era. It consists of rice and small platters of food to accompany it to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour accompaniments. The only time I've ever had this was abroad in Amsterdam, but there were about 25-30 different offerings for a meal that was about 2-2.5 hours.\n\nAppetizers: \nLemongrass Soup with Potato & Chicken: I also enjoy spooning a bit of rice and pooling in the broth so that I can taste the rich flavor of the broth. The serving size was just the right amount for a taste (about a mini-bowl's worth), but I could easily eat this as a full meal.\n\nLumpia Semarang, Indonesian fried spring rolls served with peanut dipping sauce. The fillings are similar to the Chinese Popiah (spring roll), but has a mixture of bamboo shoots, chicken & prawn. I really enjoyed these the first time I had them here because I found that they were a bit sweet, which complemented the earthiness of the peanut dipping sauce.\n\nMain Course (with rice included):\n1. Rendang: The Sumatra style beef stew is curried in various spices in coconut milk curry. The quality of the meat very tenderized yet intentionally dry.. yes, it sounds like a weird juxtaposition but the sauce makes it work successfully. This was very nostalgic of my childhood as my grandmother would also makes a similar 'Malaysian' version to this that was a bit spicier, and more along the level of dryness of dehydrated beef, or the American equivalent of 'Jerky.'  The dish often slightly varies from place-to-place, culture to culture.. but I always think about the dry flaky meat as being the catalyst or method of delivery for tasting the sauce (usually ginger, tumeric leaves, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chillies, amongst other spices)\n\n2. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe: sauteed & stir-fried Java soy bean cake Tempe that was caramelized on all sides & white tofu. Rather a simple dish and tasted similarly to the Tumis Kacang Panjang.\n\n3. Sate Ayum: 4x pieces of moist BBQ marinated chicken on skewer (all thigh meat) with peanut dressing. My only critique is that the smoky flavor did not come through as much as I've had with other Indonesian Satays, I was really hoping for the charred flavor to be injected into the meat.\n\n4. Ayum Panggang Bumbu Rujak: 2x pieces of spicy BBQ marinated chicken (with bone) contrasted nicely with the coconut milk sauce. So the end-result is a delicious spicy, yet sweet sensation on your tongue.\n\n5.Kari Udang: prawns in a mildly spicy curry sauce, with chunks of potatoes and eggplant. It goes well with the jasmine rice, but I like to also eat this with chappati, roti chanai, or nasi minyak.\n\n6. Gado-Gado/ Salade: blanched vegetables, tofu, potato, & egg covered in peanut dressing.. I only have had a Javanese 'Lotek' variation of this prior which is the same concept of various veggies covered in peanut sauce, except the veggies in that case are raw so you taste more of the crisp. Both topped with plain emping crackers (which are equally as tasty eaten by itself as a snack, or gently crushed into some lontong sayur). I thought that this version was a bit sauce heavy -but can easily be diluted with rice.\n\nDessert: \n1. Vanilla Ice Cream -creamy, lightly fragrant & sweet, garnished with a sour cherry.\n2. Black Sweet Rice with Coconut Milk: short grained and dark purple in flavor, very glutinous and sticky in texture. This is always a refreshing treat for me because it is warm, creamy, sweet from the toasted coconut, and a little savory.\n\nThis was a more focused version of it, with most curried meats, and peanut dressing.

(Note: I am basing the dish names off the restaurant's website as I can't remember the names off hand. Apologies in advance for all incorrect statements.)\n\n1. Soto Ayam - Lemon grass soup with bean sprouts, chicken, egg, and green onions. An excellent start to the meal. Just the perfect combination of ingredients to balance each other out. \n\n2. Lumpia Semarang - Fried spring rolls stuffed with chicken, carrots, tofu, and bamboo shoots. Cute appetizer. I would use the peanut sauce. Otherwise, the dish is a bit bland.\n\n3. Chicken Satay with peanut sauce - Wonderful dish. Chicken grilled to perfection. The sauce is not necessary but definitely provides a different taste experience and should be tried by all means.\n\n4. Sambal Goreng Daging - Beef stew in a chili sauce. This goes amazingly well with steamed rice. By far, my favorite dish of the evening. The extra kick of spice puts this item over the top.\n\n5. Bean cake with assorted vegetables - Apologies. I can't remember the name of the dish. Nevertheless, it was my least favorite dish. Let's not mention it again.\n\n6. Ayam Bakar Cabe - BBQ Chicken in a spicy chili sauce. The chicken by itself is fabulous. Very juicy and tender. When you add the sauce, my taste buds are overwhelmed with the different flavors. I recommend putting some sauce on coconut rice. This dish is up there with the beef stew (see #4).\n\n7. Kari Udang - Shrimp with assorted vegetables in a coconut sauce. Not too bad. Wasn't \"wow'ed\" by this dish as with the others but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n8. I can't recall this dish very well. It was nothing to memorable...no pun intended. There were fish crackers/chips (similar to those served in Chinese restaurants) that went with fried pork (i think...) \n\n9. Vanilla ice cream - Pretty self explanatory. Ice cream was standard.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time here. Dishes were pretty much a hit or miss for me, with mostly hits! For $30 (including tip & tax), I feel this is a great bargain.

"], "author": "Kat S.", "review": "I love Indonesian food! I eat it almost everyday. Well, I am from Indonesia after all, but hey, I am not biased, k? ;p \nBorobudur is one of my favorite place to eat (when I am too lazy too cook). \n\nFor many, Indonesian food is similar to other Southeast Asian cuisine such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, or even as far as India ('curry' dish is everywhere, isn't it?). However, to be fair, no cuisine from different country is exactly alike since different set of spices is used, thus giving the cuisine its unique flavor of that particular country. \n\nWhy I like Borobudur? The food, of course! Decor is minimal at best, but for a delicious treat, who would care? (as long as the place is clean) The staff is curteous, and eager to answer your inquiries on the food or what to order. Sometimes it may take a while for your order to come out. It is almost random ... well, if you understand the Indonesian term for \"rubber clock\" then perhaps you could understand this better. ^^;\n\nOk, about the food here (geez... finally.... ). You gotta know what to order (doh!) especially facing a menu with strange names you never even heard of, let alone pronounced it. \n\nFirst, to appease your stomach while waiting for the dishes to come out, I'd suggest ordering the Kerupuk Palembang, a big fish craker (it looks like thick white noodles and round in shape, you will see it displayed behind the register area). It is served with peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce. Other appetizer you may want to try is Otak-otak (don't ask what the name literally mean, ok? Trust me it is far from that ^^), and Lumpia Semarang (Indonesian version of spring roll). And remind the server to serve the drinks first, .\n\nOh right, the drinks! You got to try the Es Cendol (my fav!). It is tiny-tiny green colored jello made from rice flour served in a glass of palm sugar mixed with coconut milk. \n\nI like to start with Empek-Empek, which is a fried fish-cake with egg inside, served in a bowl of spicy-tangy dark color soup. Guaranteed to increase your appetite!\n\nAyam Kalasan is very popular in Indonesia, and Borobudur offers a mouthwatering version of it. For beef dish, I usually order Beef Rendang. It is soft and juicy and infused with spices and flavor. Beef satay? Hm... I would shift away from beef-on-a-stick, for simple reason, most of the time it will be either too dry, or too cooked, and too chewy. Just stick with the rendang. \n\nFor you spicy food lover, may I suggest Mie Tek-Tek? Be warned that their 'Mild' version of the this soupy dish is still considered quite spicy (even for me). I would order the 'dry' version because it is bearable (you can still taste other food you ordered after eating this) and easier to share with your table mates. \n\nWhen going there solo or you just don't feel like doing it 'family style' my suggestion is Mie Ayam (Chicken Noodle) or Nasi Uduk (fragrant rice).  \n\nAnd to close your dining adventure in Indonesian cuisine: I know this might be weird for a lot of people, but keep an open mind (or tongue) ok? For dessert, order the Pisang Bakar. It is grilled banana, served with cheese, chocolate and condensed milk (what the????? ;p ) Yup! you got it right ^^ \nIt is a strange combo or sweet-salty-fruity-chocolatey. It is a typical late-night snack for the young (and old) in Jakarta.

"], "author": "Geoff G.", "review": "Borobudur is an Indonesian restaurant serving up a storm. Most of their dishes are intense and robust exuding vibrant and zesty flavors. Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

Despite the colonial overtones of the name, the food very distinctly Southeast Asian in nature.\n\nI came here for lunch with a good friend while attending a conference nearby.  She had never heard of this type of cuisine (indeed, I suspect that it's probably unknown to a lot of people) and was intrigued to give it a try.  When we arrived there was only one other table occupied, even though it was the lunch hour of a regular business day.\n\nThe rijsttafel menu was varied both in food and quality.  It wasn't quite as extensive as what I recall from the Netherlands, where we seemed to have about twice as many dishes but in smaller quantities.  Nevertheless, it was a still an excellent sampling of Indonesian dishes.\n\nLumpia appetizer - crisp and hot, delicious but not particularly distinctive.\nSoto ayam - lemongrass soup.  I usually can't stand lemongrass because I think most places overdo it, but this was well done.\nGado gado salad - nice flavor, vegetables perhaps a little overcooked and soft, but still enjoyable.\nSatay ayam - standard chicken skewer, similar to what you find in the dime-a-dozen Thai restaurants.\nKari Udang - really excellent shrimp/curry dish; subtle flavors and aromas.\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - chicken in coconut milk sauce, very tasty.\nRendang - beef stew-like dish.  The waitress said that it was one of the most popular dishes, but I found it to be the least appealing.  Beef texture was a bit off, perhaps from being a little overcooked.\nOseng Oseng Tahu Tempe - my favorite dish by far.  Tofu-based dish with great flavors and texture and just the right amount of spiciness.\nBlack sweet rice in coconut milk dessert - very good.  Served warm, cleans the palate very nicely.\n\nWe also ordered the roti prata that others have raved about.  It's not on the rijsttafel menu, so that came at a small extra cost.  Pretty good, but not as overwhelming as I had expected it to be.  Perhaps I built up my expectations too much.\n\nThe price of our meal, including the extra roti, nonalcoholic beverage, and tip was less that $40 per person.  Though perhaps a little more than most would like to spend on lunch, for us it was well worth the cost for a unique dining experience.\n\nOne quibble: service was really, really slow.  Good thing we had two hours for lunch otherwise we would have felt rushed at the end.  The waitress, however, was very attentive and answered all our questions.

I added just a bit of hot sauce in it and it was perfect. We also ordered their chicken fried rice which was also good as well. Too bad its in the TL area, which is GHETTO!

(Note: I am basing the dish names off the restaurant's website as I can't remember the names off hand. Apologies in advance for all incorrect statements.)\n\n1. Soto Ayam - Lemon grass soup with bean sprouts, chicken, egg, and green onions. An excellent start to the meal. Just the perfect combination of ingredients to balance each other out. \n\n2. Lumpia Semarang - Fried spring rolls stuffed with chicken, carrots, tofu, and bamboo shoots. Cute appetizer. I would use the peanut sauce. Otherwise, the dish is a bit bland.\n\n3. Chicken Satay with peanut sauce - Wonderful dish. Chicken grilled to perfection. The sauce is not necessary but definitely provides a different taste experience and should be tried by all means.\n\n4. Sambal Goreng Daging - Beef stew in a chili sauce. This goes amazingly well with steamed rice. By far, my favorite dish of the evening. The extra kick of spice puts this item over the top.\n\n5. Bean cake with assorted vegetables - Apologies. I can't remember the name of the dish. Nevertheless, it was my least favorite dish. Let's not mention it again.\n\n6. Ayam Bakar Cabe - BBQ Chicken in a spicy chili sauce. The chicken by itself is fabulous. Very juicy and tender. When you add the sauce, my taste buds are overwhelmed with the different flavors. I recommend putting some sauce on coconut rice. This dish is up there with the beef stew (see #4).\n\n7. Kari Udang - Shrimp with assorted vegetables in a coconut sauce. Not too bad. Wasn't \"wow'ed\" by this dish as with the others but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n8. I can't recall this dish very well. It was nothing to memorable...no pun intended. There were fish crackers/chips (similar to those served in Chinese restaurants) that went with fried pork (i think...) \n\n9. Vanilla ice cream - Pretty self explanatory. Ice cream was standard.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time here. Dishes were pretty much a hit or miss for me, with mostly hits! For $30 (including tip & tax), I feel this is a great bargain.

I could only take a few sips of it and I was done. \nThis time, it was more crowded, but of course, it's Friday night, prime time dinner slot.

"], "author": "Geoff G.", "review": "Borobudur is an Indonesian restaurant serving up a storm. Most of their dishes are intense and robust exuding vibrant and zesty flavors. Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

I was really hoping the whole meal would be satisfying, but this left a sour (or more like burnt) taste in our mouthes.\n\nMinus 1 star for the yucky tablecloth stain that was there when we sat down.\n\nService was fine, but just included the basics- take your order, refill your water, & bring your check, w/ nothing over the top.\n\nIf I am ever in the mood for Indonesian appetizers & some tasty coconut rice, I'll come back soley for those, but as far as everything else...

At least it was a cute, spacious place that was run by Indonesians (meaning authentic food) and the service was up to par.\n\nRoti Prata ($7.50) - We got 2 orders of this and was served with a curry dipping sauce. The roti was freshly made and soft...the sauce was a delicious component with a hint of spiciness.

Dipping into the curry sauce soaks up some spicy flavor without softening the yummy crunch.\n\nSiomay Ayam Goreng: Not like the dumplings I'm familiar with from Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Thai/Nepalese/Burmese/Korean cultures.

The spicy peanut sauce was a great sauce.\n\nEmpal Goreng:\"Friend honey beef\" was a rather strange description so I had to give this a try.  It was like Beef Rendang without the curry sauce.

Each element was cooked perfectly and each flavor complimented the next. \n  This is the first Indonesian spot (out side of Indonesia) that I have enjoyed the cuisine.

So one day on a whim we decided to drive all the way to San Francisco from Fremont, and we went to Borobudur.\n\nIndonesian food takes pretty long to prepare, and since my girlfriend and I were planning on only staying for about an hour, she suggested that we called and ordered. We gave them our arrival time of 1pm, which is during the busy lunchtime, yet we were still accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered the Gado Gado, which is a warm salad consisting of steamed vegetables, tofu, eggs and shrimp crackers all mixed in a tasty peanut sauce. This is a great dish to get someone who doesn't usually eat vegetables to eat some because the way they prepare it is excellent. We also ordered the Ayam Bakar Cabe which is barbecued marinated spicy chicken with a red chili sauce. The inside of the chicken was a little dry, however, the flavor is unbelievably good. We also got Rendang, which is basically beef brisket cooked in a coconut milk sauce which plenty of spices. This was excellent as the flavor was present in the entire dish, not just the top layer. We also got the Gulai Kambing, which is Lamb cooked in a curry and coconut milk sauce. This was by far my favorite. The curry taste was not overpowering, the lamb, which is usually a strong tasting meat was not overpowering and the entire sauce goes very well with rice. And finally we got the Tumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas, which is just water spinach that has been cooked in a spicy shrimp paste and spicy chili. This totally beats the chinese style that is cooked in just msg and garlic. This is flavorful and for once I was able to finish my vegetables. For drinks we got the Es Teller which is just mixed fruits in a coconut milk and Es Kelapa Muda which is basically just Coconut milk. Both were very refreshing to go with the spicy Indonesian food. And finally for dessert my girlfriend had to order the Es Duren, which is an Indonesian layer cake, where according to my girlfriend, they bake one layer of cake at a time and then they pound it really thin, then they bake another layer and then pound that really thin and layer it again. I guess Indonesian people like food that takes absurdly long to prepare, but I definitely am not complaining =).\n\nOur total bill came out to be around 80 dollars; 100 dollars for 2 people including tip. Which is not so bad considering I had a lot of food left over and we got drinks and dessert.

I love the way Borobudur makes it, it's coconut-y and spicy at the same time! They manage to give their rendang beef this incredible mixture of sweet, savory and spicy at the same time.

Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

My gracious host, being born in Indonesia, kindly gave me a taste of local authentic foods from his home country.  Unlike Cantonese cuisine where most local restaurants predominantly use soy sauce or oyster sauce, the flavor profile adds the sour and sweet elements and different textures in unexpected ways.  If you are adventurous and not afraid to try something new, you will likely enjoy this, but make sure you bring someone in the know to guide you. The food ranks 3.5 stars with an added 0.5 star for the authenticity of the cuisine.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-09-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - chicken in coconut milk sauce, very tasty.\n"], "author": "Lee L.", "review": "Given the amazing diversity of culinary choices in the SF Bay Area, I'm surprised that there aren't more places that offer rijsttafel, an Indonesian small plate meal that takes its name from the Dutch word for \"rice table\".  Despite the colonial overtones of the name, the food very distinctly Southeast Asian in nature.\n\nI came here for lunch with a good friend while attending a conference nearby.  She had never heard of this type of cuisine (indeed, I suspect that it's probably unknown to a lot of people) and was intrigued to give it a try.  When we arrived there was only one other table occupied, even though it was the lunch hour of a regular business day.\n\nThe rijsttafel menu was varied both in food and quality.  It wasn't quite as extensive as what I recall from the Netherlands, where we seemed to have about twice as many dishes but in smaller quantities.  Nevertheless, it was a still an excellent sampling of Indonesian dishes.\n\nLumpia appetizer - crisp and hot, delicious but not particularly distinctive.\nSoto ayam - lemongrass soup.  I usually can't stand lemongrass because I think most places overdo it, but this was well done.\nGado gado salad - nice flavor, vegetables perhaps a little overcooked and soft, but still enjoyable.\nSatay ayam - standard chicken skewer, similar to what you find in the dime-a-dozen Thai restaurants.\nKari Udang - really excellent shrimp/curry dish; subtle flavors and aromas.\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - chicken in coconut milk sauce, very tasty.\nRendang - beef stew-like dish.  The waitress said that it was one of the most popular dishes, but I found it to be the least appealing.  Beef texture was a bit off, perhaps from being a little overcooked.\nOseng Oseng Tahu Tempe - my favorite dish by far.  Tofu-based dish with great flavors and texture and just the right amount of spiciness.\nBlack sweet rice in coconut milk dessert - very good.  Served warm, cleans the palate very nicely.\n\nWe also ordered the roti prata that others have raved about.  It's not on the rijsttafel menu, so that came at a small extra cost.  Pretty good, but not as overwhelming as I had expected it to be.  Perhaps I built up my expectations too much.\n\nThe price of our meal, including the extra roti, nonalcoholic beverage, and tip was less that $40 per person.  Though perhaps a little more than most would like to spend on lunch, for us it was well worth the cost for a unique dining experience.\n\nOne quibble: service was really, really slow.  Good thing we had two hours for lunch otherwise we would have felt rushed at the end.  The waitress, however, was very attentive and answered all our questions.

Overall, we really enjoyed the dishes that we ordered and were annoyed with the service.  Note that the review rating is specifically for the food.  \n\nLate on a Friday night, we had reservations for a group of 5. A few people in my party were not on time to get to the table. Once we were all seated, the staff seemed eager to get us to order right away.  One staff member especially had a really snappy attitude and seemed to rush us in ordering saying their \"kitchen was busy\". Now, had there been lots of people waiting to be seated, I would understand.  But, all groups awaiting a table were 2-3 people and their smaller tables were turning over quickly.  So needless to say, I was less than impressed by his demeanor!\n \nWe ordered appetizers and main dishes.  Each dish was flavorful and unique. I loved the food so much that I would consider going back (realllly hope service is better next time!!) or taking food to go. \n- Roti Prata (Pan fried layered bread served with curry dipping sauce),\n  This flaky goodness reminds me of biscuits but with the crunch of fried food! Dipping it in curry adds a blast of flavor on this comfort food.\n\n- Sate Kombinasi (Combination of grilled marinated chicken & beef on skewers served with peanut sauce),\n  Both chicken and steak were juicy and steaming hot. I love me some succulent meaat.  \n\n- Combination Spicy Seafood AKA \"Seafood Pedas Selera\" (Sauteed squid, fish fillet & shrimp cooked with traditional spicy sauce)\n  We ordered this because we saw it on a nearby table and it looked pretty good! It's a bit on the spicy side (6.5 on a 10 spice heat scale).  \n\n- Rendang (Sumatra beef stew cooked with spices in coconut milk sauce)\n  Perfectly simmered beef stew.  It simply melts in your mouth! \n\n- BBQ Chicken Curry AKA \"Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak\" (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with coconut milk) \n  Very flavorful chicken curry! \n\n- Nasi Goreng w/ chicken and shrimp (Indonesian fried rice with egg, onion, and meat) \n  This fried rice was the perfect accompaniment for all the other flavorful main courses. \n\n- Mie Tek Tek Goreng w/ chicken + mixed vegetables (Spicy Java Stir fried noodle with egg & vegetables)  \n  Loved these noodles!

The beef was pull apart tender, the spices were flavourful, not spicy and the coconut sause added a nice texture.\n\nTahu & Terong Balado (Egplant & Tofu cooked in Spicy Chili)\nBoy was it SPICY, this dish had more then spice though, it had good, hot flavour. Sadly, the eggplant was a little overcooked in my opinion, the tofu was great.\n\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (BBQ chicken w/ spicy coconut sauce)\nThis was probably my favorite dish of the meal. The chicken was on the bone, booked perfectly, was super juicy and had a great, flavor and spice that was cut by the sweetness of the Coconut Milk Sauce..

And it tasted wonderful as well. It was soft in flavor, the shrimp were not over or under cooked, the veggies where crisp yet soft and that coconut curry sauce was to die for.\n\nBubur Ketan Hitam (Black sweet rice w/ fresh coconut milk)\nWow... Wow... Wow... I could have eaten 5 servings of this. I loved that I was given a small bowl with the rice on the bottom and coconut milk on top and was expected to mix it myself, this allowed us to watch the transformation, the rice was hot and heated up the milk, once mixed it looked like chunky slightly melted chocolate and it was HEAVEN in my mouth.

We came on Tuesday night at around 6:30 PM. There was no wait as there were only 2 other tables filled.\n\nFOOD:\n*Martabak Sapi (Ground beef with egg & onion in crispy dough): It was just meh. We expected something more of a samosa filled with stir-fried ground beef. What we got was a steamed Viet-like meatloaf wrapped in a wonton wrapper and fried. The filling itself was quite bland.\n\n*Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce): The chicken was very flavorful and was fork tender. What made the dish was the sauce. You can tell the sauce was a result of a slow reduction of the coconut milk and spices braising the chicken which produced a very flavorful and rich sauce. I love spicy foods, and this dish has the right amount of kick from the chili, ginger, and other spices. \n\n*Rendang (Beef cooked with coconut milk in spice): The BEST dish of the night. Normally, I'm use to Rendang in a coconut curry sauce. Borobudor's Rendang is covered in a very thick coconut spicy sauce. The huge chunks of beef were SUPER tender and broke apart easily with a fork. Just like the chicken, the beef was braised slowly in the coconut milk and spice concoction which produced a very flavorful, thick, and rich sauce which glued to the beef. This with rice....*Drool*\n\n*Mie Tek Tek (Stir-fried noodle with chicken, egg and vegetables): We ordered this dish after all the rave reviews on YELP; but I have to say it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was basically Pad See Ew made with chow mein noodles. Although the dish itself had great flavor from the garlic, soy sauce, sugar, and other spices; the noodles were a bit mushy and the chicken breast strips were very bland and dry. \n\nSERVICE: Borobudor's service is slow, very very slow. We ordered at 6:45 pm and didn't get our appetizer until 7:18 pm. All this time while waiting for our appetizer, 5 parties who arrived and ordered AFTER us, all received their appetizers and main entrees before us. Ok, something is wrong with this picture!!! Needless to say, we were highly frustrated and was very close to walking out the door. \n\nAfter receiving our food, they never checked on us and we had to flag them down when we needed hot sauce or more napkins. \n\nService can make or break your restaurant experience.

Most of their dishes are intense and robust exuding vibrant and zesty flavors. Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

She had never heard of this type of cuisine (indeed, I suspect that it's probably unknown to a lot of people) and was intrigued to give it a try.  When we arrived there was only one other table occupied, even though it was the lunch hour of a regular business day.\n\nThe rijsttafel menu was varied both in food and quality.  It wasn't quite as extensive as what I recall from the Netherlands, where we seemed to have about twice as many dishes but in smaller quantities.  Nevertheless, it was a still an excellent sampling of Indonesian dishes.\n\nLumpia appetizer - crisp and hot, delicious but not particularly distinctive.\nSoto ayam - lemongrass soup.

It consists of rice and small platters of food to accompany it to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour accompaniments. The only time I've ever had this was abroad in Amsterdam, but there were about 25-30 different offerings for a meal that was about 2-2.5 hours.\n\nAppetizers: \nLemongrass Soup with Potato & Chicken: I also enjoy spooning a bit of rice and pooling in the broth so that I can taste the rich flavor of the broth. The serving size was just the right amount for a taste (about a mini-bowl's worth), but I could easily eat this as a full meal.\n\nLumpia Semarang, Indonesian fried spring rolls served with peanut dipping sauce. The fillings are similar to the Chinese Popiah (spring roll), but has a mixture of bamboo shoots, chicken & prawn. I really enjoyed these the first time I had them here because I found that they were a bit sweet, which complemented the earthiness of the peanut dipping sauce.\n\nMain Course (with rice included):\n1. Rendang: The Sumatra style beef stew is curried in various spices in coconut milk curry. The quality of the meat very tenderized yet intentionally dry.. yes, it sounds like a weird juxtaposition but the sauce makes it work successfully. This was very nostalgic of my childhood as my grandmother would also makes a similar 'Malaysian' version to this that was a bit spicier, and more along the level of dryness of dehydrated beef, or the American equivalent of 'Jerky.'  The dish often slightly varies from place-to-place, culture to culture.. but I always think about the dry flaky meat as being the catalyst or method of delivery for tasting the sauce (usually ginger, tumeric leaves, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chillies, amongst other spices)\n\n2. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe: sauteed & stir-fried Java soy bean cake Tempe that was caramelized on all sides & white tofu. Rather a simple dish and tasted similarly to the Tumis Kacang Panjang.\n\n3. Sate Ayum: 4x pieces of moist BBQ marinated chicken on skewer (all thigh meat) with peanut dressing. My only critique is that the smoky flavor did not come through as much as I've had with other Indonesian Satays, I was really hoping for the charred flavor to be injected into the meat.\n\n4. Ayum Panggang Bumbu Rujak: 2x pieces of spicy BBQ marinated chicken (with bone) contrasted nicely with the coconut milk sauce. So the end-result is a delicious spicy, yet sweet sensation on your tongue.\n\n5.Kari Udang: prawns in a mildly spicy curry sauce, with chunks of potatoes and eggplant. It goes well with the jasmine rice, but I like to also eat this with chappati, roti chanai, or nasi minyak.\n\n6. Gado-Gado/ Salade: blanched vegetables, tofu, potato, & egg covered in peanut dressing.. I only have had a Javanese 'Lotek' variation of this prior which is the same concept of various veggies covered in peanut sauce, except the veggies in that case are raw so you taste more of the crisp. Both topped with plain emping crackers (which are equally as tasty eaten by itself as a snack, or gently crushed into some lontong sayur). I thought that this version was a bit sauce heavy -but can easily be diluted with rice.\n\nDessert: \n1. Vanilla Ice Cream -creamy, lightly fragrant & sweet, garnished with a sour cherry.\n2. Black Sweet Rice with Coconut Milk: short grained and dark purple in flavor, very glutinous and sticky in texture. This is always a refreshing treat for me because it is warm, creamy, sweet from the toasted coconut, and a little savory.\n\nThis was a more focused version of it, with most curried meats, and peanut dressing.

FYI, I've been to Indonesia and have tried legit indo food, so I'm very picky and critical.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered 3 orders of ground beef Martabak Sapi. Wow were they big!

It was actually really authentic- way cooked down beef that falls apart on the fork, in a dry curry with the perfect proportion of spices.  This with a bowl of rice is total comfort food.\n\nOther items were not so great.  The recommended veggies (spinach and tofu) had so much belachan that it overwhelmed the entire dish.  The grilled fish marinated in dried spices with \"Indonesian salsa\" was disappointing too.  The marinade tasted more like bottled sweet and sour sauce, and the salsa wasn't very interesting either. At this point I was really missing all of the delicious sambals that come with every meal in Indonesia.  (I asked about sambal and the waiter said they were out.)\n\nSo...the worst for last...dessert.  Why we ordered this, I don't know:  grilled banana with cheese and chocolate.  An adventurous thought, maybe?  What arrived was actually half a plantain absolutely smothered in shredded, unmelted cheddar, drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with waxy chocolate sprinkles.  It tasted about as appetizing as it sounds.   Do not get this!\n\nA little over $60 for two people made for a mildly overpriced experiment.

The beef was pull apart tender, the spices were flavourful, not spicy and the coconut sause added a nice texture.\n\nTahu & Terong Balado (Egplant & Tofu cooked in Spicy Chili)\nBoy was it SPICY, this dish had more then spice though, it had good, hot flavour. Sadly, the eggplant was a little overcooked in my opinion, the tofu was great.\n\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (BBQ chicken w/ spicy coconut sauce)\nThis was probably my favorite dish of the meal. The chicken was on the bone, booked perfectly, was super juicy and had a great, flavor and spice that was cut by the sweetness of the Coconut Milk Sauce.. WINNER.\n\nKari Udang (Shrimp & Veggies in Coconut Curry Sauce)\nHere we had a very simple dish, I wish I had taken a photo because it was beautiful, colourful, bright, light, it was just so pretty! And it tasted wonderful as well. It was soft in flavor, the shrimp were not over or under cooked, the veggies where crisp yet soft and that coconut curry sauce was to die for.\n\nBubur Ketan Hitam (Black sweet rice w/ fresh coconut milk)\nWow... Wow... Wow... I could have eaten 5 servings of this. I loved that I was given a small bowl with the rice on the bottom and coconut milk on top and was expected to mix it myself, this allowed us to watch the transformation, the rice was hot and heated up the milk, once mixed it looked like chunky slightly melted chocolate and it was HEAVEN in my mouth.

Love how the Indonesian roti is so much fluffier and crispier than Indian rotis.  Dipping into the curry sauce soaks up some spicy flavor without softening the yummy crunch.\n\nSiomay Ayam Goreng: Not like the dumplings I'm familiar with from Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Thai/Nepalese/Burmese/Korean cultures.  More like a meatball of ground chicken and seafood sliced in half and deep fried.  Tasty even without the doughy wrapper.  The spicy peanut sauce was a great sauce.\n\nEmpal Goreng:\"Friend honey beef\" was a rather strange description so I had to give this a try.  It was like Beef Rendang without the curry sauce.  It was a tad dry, but extremely tender and tasty.  Kind of like Indonesian-fied Yankee Pot Roast.\n\nAyam Bakar Cabe: Nothing fancy, just BBQ chicken with a spicy chili marinade.  I will say the meat was EXTREMELY tender and juicy, oddly better in consistency than what I've had at most other places.  How do they do that?\n\nMie Tek Tek: When at an Asian restaurant that serves rice \u00e0 la carte, I'd much rather get a noodle dish for the table than have each person commit a universal faux pas to Asian parents (even if they aren't Asian themselves) by buying individual rice sides.

The lemongrass soup - it was ok, Mingalaba in Burlingame makes a better lemongrass soup imo. \n\n2.

Well, I am from Indonesia after all, but hey, I am not biased, k? ;p \nBorobudur is one of my favorite place to eat (when I am too lazy too cook). \n\nFor many, Indonesian food is similar to other Southeast Asian cuisine such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, or even as far as India ('curry' dish is everywhere, isn't it?). However, to be fair, no cuisine from different country is exactly alike since different set of spices is used, thus giving the cuisine its unique flavor of that particular country. \n\nWhy I like Borobudur? The food, of course! Decor is minimal at best, but for a delicious treat, who would care? (as long as the place is clean) The staff is curteous, and eager to answer your inquiries on the food or what to order. Sometimes it may take a while for your order to come out. It is almost random ... well, if you understand the Indonesian term for \"rubber clock\" then perhaps you could understand this better. ^^;\n\nOk, about the food here (geez... finally.... ). You gotta know what to order (doh!) especially facing a menu with strange names you never even heard of, let alone pronounced it. \n\nFirst, to appease your stomach while waiting for the dishes to come out, I'd suggest ordering the Kerupuk Palembang, a big fish craker (it looks like thick white noodles and round in shape, you will see it displayed behind the register area). It is served with peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce. Other appetizer you may want to try is Otak-otak (don't ask what the name literally mean, ok? Trust me it is far from that ^^), and Lumpia Semarang (Indonesian version of spring roll). And remind the server to serve the drinks first, .\n\nOh right, the drinks! You got to try the Es Cendol (my fav!). It is tiny-tiny green colored jello made from rice flour served in a glass of palm sugar mixed with coconut milk. \n\nI like to start with Empek-Empek, which is a fried fish-cake with egg inside, served in a bowl of spicy-tangy dark color soup. Guaranteed to increase your appetite!\n\nAyam Kalasan is very popular in Indonesia, and Borobudur offers a mouthwatering version of it. For beef dish, I usually order Beef Rendang. It is soft and juicy and infused with spices and flavor. Beef satay? Hm... I would shift away from beef-on-a-stick, for simple reason, most of the time it will be either too dry, or too cooked, and too chewy. Just stick with the rendang. \n\nFor you spicy food lover, may I suggest Mie Tek-Tek? Be warned that their 'Mild' version of the this soupy dish is still considered quite spicy (even for me). I would order the 'dry' version because it is bearable (you can still taste other food you ordered after eating this) and easier to share with your table mates. \n\nWhen going there solo or you just don't feel like doing it 'family style' my suggestion is Mie Ayam (Chicken Noodle) or Nasi Uduk (fragrant rice).  \n\nAnd to close your dining adventure in Indonesian cuisine: I know this might be weird for a lot of people, but keep an open mind (or tongue) ok? For dessert, order the Pisang Bakar. It is grilled banana, served with cheese, chocolate and condensed milk (what the????? ;p ) Yup! you got it right ^^ \nIt is a strange combo or sweet-salty-fruity-chocolatey. It is a typical late-night snack for the young (and old) in Jakarta.

They came up with a nicely balanced selection of 3 grilled or stewed meat dishes (chicken satay with a really exceptional peanut sauce) Rendang (a great beef stew) and Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (BBQ marinated chicken in a coconut milk sauce) as well as 3 vegetable dishes - Tahu Terong Balado (eggplant and tofu in chili sauce - really good!)

I would peer into the window, see a few diners inside; while never crowded or ever near capacity, seeing Asian patrons bode well of the restaurant's authenticity. Tonight I finally ventured in to satiate my curiosity. And I wasn't disappointed.\n\nGreeted warmly, we were seated in one of many booths that lined the perimeter of the restaurant. The room was aglow with candle light and made for a very pleasant evening meal. Glancing at the menu, our eyes widened at the first page - Rijsttafel. Unpronounceable, we still marveled at the list of foods included in their prix fix. For about $27, one can enjoy - lemongrass soup, fried spring roll, chicken satay in peanut sauce, cucumber salad with shrimp chips, stir fried tofu, beef rendang, bbq chicken in chili sauce, shrimp and vegetable curry, jasmine rice, and dessert. The food presentation was quite marvelous. The main dishes and rice came out in individual bowls atop of a long rectangular double deck tray, the bottom tray full of tea lights to keep the food warm while you eat. How cool is that?\n\n10 courses allowed us to get a taste of Indonesia. Favorite savory dishes from the set were the salad in peanut sauce (cool crisp, nutty flavor) and the fried tofu (slightly sweet and soft). The other dishes were good too but not necessarily extraordinary. The dessert of black rice with coconut milk (Burbur Ketan Hitam) was delish though. We couldn't get enough of the chewy rice, with the sweet milk. \n\nSo on top of all that food, we also sampled the Roti Prata ($7.50), which is a pan fried layered bread served with curry dipping sauce. Oooh sooo good. This was the biggest, flakiest roti I've had. We also ordered the Mie Tek Tek ($9.95), spicy stir fried noodles with chicken and vegetables. It comes extra spicy so be sure to ask them to temper it to your tastes buds. Would definitely order both of these dishes again.\n\nAll in all, a fabulous dining experience.

I really had high hopes for this place because of the incredible reviews. It's sad but it was a very forgettable meal. \n\nHere is what we had between 6 adults:\n\n1. Grilled Trout with chili lime sauce - this dish was decent... the sauce needed a punch. \n2. 2 orders off the Lumpia (eggrolls)  with a peanut dipping sauce. Again very average.. . I guess I have been spoiled with amazing Vietnamese eggrolls. The fillings to the eggrolls tasted dry.. needed some fat. And the dipping sauce was too rich and heavy for me. \n3. Shrimp curry - Again missing that wow factor.. was extremely mild. I like my curries strong and complex. I was comparing it to the wonderful Thai curries I love. \n4. Fried noodles.. with egg, chicken, forgot the name . This was my favorite dish.. You can't really  mess up fried noodles. It was my comfort dish for the night.\n5. Lamb curry - My father enjoyed this dish. He said that the lamb was tender. I did not try this dish because I do not eat lamb. Most of the table enjoyed this dish\n6. Spicy Chicken - By far the worse dish! This was actually a rec from the waiter. It was just a big thigh/drum stick fried and smothered with some chili /syracha sauce. It appeared to be a safe dish they would rec to people that are trying Asian food for the first time. Mild and non offensive. Very very disspointed with this dish.  It was a dish you make at home with leftover chicken and just toss hot sauce on.\n7. Beef Stew- Rendang? I was really looking forward to this one becuase I have had it at another Indonesian restaurant before. The meat was very tender, but it was SO Salty!!!! I could not get over how salty it was.. it tasted like they poured ina whole cup of salt in it!!!!\n\nFor dessert we shared:\n\nFried Banana with Ice Cream -  I was expecting a crispy crust and soft banana inside.. it was dense and tasted like old oil.\n\nSweet sticky rice with coconut milk - I enjoyed the glutinous rice and combination of the coconut milk\n\nService was impeccable.. they were very attentive.. always filled our glasses full of water and cleared out the plates when we needed them to without asking. \n\nMaybe I ordered all the wrong dishes?

Borobudur is a revelation for weary eaters craving a departure from the standard Thai and Vietnamese fares that have come to almost wholly represent Southeast Asian cookery for many of us simpletons. Flavors brought to our neck of the woods from this exotic archipelago of a thousand-plus islands offers cleaner, deeper, and subtly yet superbly more aromatic complexities to the palate than what we get at those greasy noodle haunts or even those chic bistros to satisfy our Southeast Asian hankerings. \n\nTasting this stuff for the first time at Borobudur sent pangs of regret that I hadn't explored the amazing spectrum of flavors that make up Indonesian cuisine sooner. Sweet, spicy, nutty, and floral, our dinner had us slurping, licking, and scraping down to our very last bites. The chicken lumpia started us off with perfectly fried little egg rolls that shattered cleanly like delicate glass at our bites containing tender, well-seasoned diced chicken and vegetables. Mie tek tek was satisfying and hearty with slices of chicken, chewy egg noodles and assorted vegetables swimming in an addicting peanutty-sweet-spicy broth that was hearty yet light at the same time. I had wanted to try the rendang but instead opted for Sambal Goreng Daging, pieces of beef stewed in a spicy, silky broth with al dente green beans and red peppers galore. To salve the absence of coconut from opting out of the rendang, we had an order of coconut rice, which packs a punch of an intensity previously known to my buds of coconut rice. \n\nEverything was delicious and eye-opening, albeit a bit sweet. I feel that this fare tries to put more of a direct focus on the sweetness instead of just using it as a foil to accentuate the saltiness of many savory dishes of other Asian cuisines, most of which, especially in restaurants, contain a lot more sugar than we'd like to think. What results at Borobudur out of this are flavors that start off as pleasantly mild and tunnel into a complexity that surprises and tantalizes.\n\nService, contrary to many reviews, was top-notch; we had multiple servers doting upon us and had a lovely dining experience. Out of this, I would suggest a late dinner at Borobudur to avoid the 7-8:30 dinner rush.\n\nI thank Borobudur for opening my eyes to territories previously unchartered in my mouth, but would like to date other restaurants (like, say the cheaper and closer Jayakarta in Berkeley) before entertaining any ideas of exclusivity.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["* Rendang Beef - tender and flavorful.

So one day on a whim we decided to drive all the way to San Francisco from Fremont, and we went to Borobudur.\n\nIndonesian food takes pretty long to prepare, and since my girlfriend and I were planning on only staying for about an hour, she suggested that we called and ordered. We gave them our arrival time of 1pm, which is during the busy lunchtime, yet we were still accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered the Gado Gado, which is a warm salad consisting of steamed vegetables, tofu, eggs and shrimp crackers all mixed in a tasty peanut sauce. This is a great dish to get someone who doesn't usually eat vegetables to eat some because the way they prepare it is excellent. We also ordered the Ayam Bakar Cabe which is barbecued marinated spicy chicken with a red chili sauce. The inside of the chicken was a little dry, however, the flavor is unbelievably good. We also got Rendang, which is basically beef brisket cooked in a coconut milk sauce which plenty of spices. This was excellent as the flavor was present in the entire dish, not just the top layer. We also got the Gulai Kambing, which is Lamb cooked in a curry and coconut milk sauce. This was by far my favorite. The curry taste was not overpowering, the lamb, which is usually a strong tasting meat was not overpowering and the entire sauce goes very well with rice. And finally we got the Tumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas, which is just water spinach that has been cooked in a spicy shrimp paste and spicy chili. This totally beats the chinese style that is cooked in just msg and garlic. This is flavorful and for once I was able to finish my vegetables. For drinks we got the Es Teller which is just mixed fruits in a coconut milk and Es Kelapa Muda which is basically just Coconut milk. Both were very refreshing to go with the spicy Indonesian food. And finally for dessert my girlfriend had to order the Es Duren, which is an Indonesian layer cake, where according to my girlfriend, they bake one layer of cake at a time and then they pound it really thin, then they bake another layer and then pound that really thin and layer it again.

Even their vegetable curry is delicate sheer and savory--not pummeled with an over-sugary thick sauce.

Favorite of the three apps.\n\n3) Gado-gado (Steamed vegetables, tofu, potato, egg, & shrimp cracker with peanut dressing) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA#5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA) - Plethora of textures and flavors.\n\nMain\n 4) Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with coconut milk) - Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA#k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA) - Looks more like a curry preparation so the seasonings are unexpected; meat was tender.\n\n5) Empal Goreng (Fried marinated honey beef) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w#tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w) - Like the soy bean cake, this is dryer and comparable to beef jerky.\n\n6) Tumis Kangkung Bawang Putih (Sauteed water spinach with garlic) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)  - Seasonal, this is my favorite Asian vegetable, cooked and seasoned just right.\n\n7)  Ikan Bakar Sumudra / Trout fish (Grilled fish with tropical spices) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Flaky and tasty, reminds me of smoked fish.\n\nDesserts\n 8) Bubur Ketan Hitam - Black sweet rice - Least favorite of the three desserts as very filling.\n\n9) Es Cendol (Rice flour cake with ice & palm sugar syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw#_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw) - Think of an icy Thai iced tea with grass jelly and gelatinous textured accompaniments.\n\n10) Es Campur (Mixed tropical fruits with shave ice, condensed milk, chocolate & raspberry syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Shave ice - My favorite of the three desserts, the chocolate and raspberry flavors are unexpected.\n\nBeing my maiden voyage in Indonesian cuisine, the variety highlighted this roller coaster of a meal as many of the foods did not taste like they \"looked\".  My gracious host, being born in Indonesia, kindly gave me a taste of local authentic foods from his home country.  Unlike Cantonese cuisine where most local restaurants predominantly use soy sauce or oyster sauce, the flavor profile adds the sour and sweet elements and different textures in unexpected ways.

It's safe to say that I'd come back here if I was in the area. We ordered a lot of dishes, all had large portions and they all tasted pretty well. FYI, I've been to Indonesia and have tried legit indo food, so I'm very picky and critical.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered 3 orders of ground beef Martabak Sapi. Wow were they big! It was pretty tasty and filling. The ground beef was a bit dry, but luckily the rest of the ingredients weren't. It's a great appetizer to share with others, but I'd suggest only eating one or two pieces or else you're going to get full easily.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of my favorite Indonesian dish, beef rendang.

Unfortunately, this was definitely my favorite rendang. \n\nWe ordered two orders of Soto betawi, an Indonesian coconut soup with beef, cabbage, potato & tomato.

The chicken was sweet! I loved it! I love honey and I love chicken, so this combo just made my day! I enjoyed the honey cooked onto the chicken to perfection. To me, it felt like the honey definitely stuck on the chicken well.\n\nLastly, we ordered 3 dishes of some carbs: Nasi Goreng (regular Indonesian fried rice for those who cannot take spicy food, Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas (tTraditional spicy shrimp paste fried rice with egg, onion), and Bakmi Goreng (stir fried egg noodle with egg & vegetables), all with chicken.

I love the way Borobudur makes it, it's coconut-y and spicy at the same time! They manage to give their rendang beef this incredible mixture of sweet, savory and spicy at the same time.

So one day on a whim we decided to drive all the way to San Francisco from Fremont, and we went to Borobudur.\n\nIndonesian food takes pretty long to prepare, and since my girlfriend and I were planning on only staying for about an hour, she suggested that we called and ordered. We gave them our arrival time of 1pm, which is during the busy lunchtime, yet we were still accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered the Gado Gado, which is a warm salad consisting of steamed vegetables, tofu, eggs and shrimp crackers all mixed in a tasty peanut sauce. This is a great dish to get someone who doesn't usually eat vegetables to eat some because the way they prepare it is excellent. We also ordered the Ayam Bakar Cabe which is barbecued marinated spicy chicken with a red chili sauce. The inside of the chicken was a little dry, however, the flavor is unbelievably good. We also got Rendang, which is basically beef brisket cooked in a coconut milk sauce which plenty of spices. This was excellent as the flavor was present in the entire dish, not just the top layer. We also got the Gulai Kambing, which is Lamb cooked in a curry and coconut milk sauce. This was by far my favorite. The curry taste was not overpowering, the lamb, which is usually a strong tasting meat was not overpowering and the entire sauce goes very well with rice. And finally we got the Tumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas, which is just water spinach that has been cooked in a spicy shrimp paste and spicy chili. This totally beats the chinese style that is cooked in just msg and garlic. This is flavorful and for once I was able to finish my vegetables. For drinks we got the Es Teller which is just mixed fruits in a coconut milk and Es Kelapa Muda which is basically just Coconut milk. Both were very refreshing to go with the spicy Indonesian food. And finally for dessert my girlfriend had to order the Es Duren, which is an Indonesian layer cake, where according to my girlfriend, they bake one layer of cake at a time and then they pound it really thin, then they bake another layer and then pound that really thin and layer it again. I guess Indonesian people like food that takes absurdly long to prepare, but I definitely am not complaining =).\n\nOur total bill came out to be around 80 dollars; 100 dollars for 2 people including tip.

"], "author": "Geoff G.", "review": "Borobudur is an Indonesian restaurant serving up a storm. Most of their dishes are intense and robust exuding vibrant and zesty flavors. Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

Despite the colonial overtones of the name, the food very distinctly Southeast Asian in nature.\n\nI came here for lunch with a good friend while attending a conference nearby.  She had never heard of this type of cuisine (indeed, I suspect that it's probably unknown to a lot of people) and was intrigued to give it a try.  When we arrived there was only one other table occupied, even though it was the lunch hour of a regular business day.\n\nThe rijsttafel menu was varied both in food and quality.  It wasn't quite as extensive as what I recall from the Netherlands, where we seemed to have about twice as many dishes but in smaller quantities.  Nevertheless, it was a still an excellent sampling of Indonesian dishes.\n\nLumpia appetizer - crisp and hot, delicious but not particularly distinctive.\nSoto ayam - lemongrass soup.  I usually can't stand lemongrass because I think most places overdo it, but this was well done.\nGado gado salad - nice flavor, vegetables perhaps a little overcooked and soft, but still enjoyable.\nSatay ayam - standard chicken skewer, similar to what you find in the dime-a-dozen Thai restaurants.\nKari Udang - really excellent shrimp/curry dish; subtle flavors and aromas.\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - chicken in coconut milk sauce, very tasty.\nRendang - beef stew-like dish.  The waitress said that it was one of the most popular dishes, but I found it to be the least appealing.  Beef texture was a bit off, perhaps from being a little overcooked.\nOseng Oseng Tahu Tempe - my favorite dish by far.  Tofu-based dish with great flavors and texture and just the right amount of spiciness.\nBlack sweet rice in coconut milk dessert - very good.  Served warm, cleans the palate very nicely.\n\nWe also ordered the roti prata that others have raved about.  It's not on the rijsttafel menu, so that came at a small extra cost.  Pretty good, but not as overwhelming as I had expected it to be.  Perhaps I built up my expectations too much.\n\nThe price of our meal, including the extra roti, nonalcoholic beverage, and tip was less that $40 per person.

Aside from meeting some really great people I had a chance to partake in some seriously good food (and let's face it, this is really why I showed up!)\n\nOur meal was served family style, which was perfect in breaking the ice and getting to know one another. \n\nOur menu:\nSoto Ayam Soup (Lemon Grass, Bean Sprout, Egg, Chicken, Rice Noodle)\nIt was fantastic, very smooth, bursting with flavor, I LOVED IT.\n\nTahu Goregn (Fried Tofu with Hot Garlic Peanut Sauce)\nI wasn't super impressed with this dish, the tofu was cooked well, but the breading was lacking in flavor, the sauce was decent, I don't love peanuts or peanut sauces so I may be bias. \n\nRendang (Sumatra beef stew cooked with Spices in Coconut Milk Sauce)\nYUM. The beef was pull apart tender, the spices were flavourful, not spicy and the coconut sause added a nice texture.\n\nTahu & Terong Balado (Egplant & Tofu cooked in Spicy Chili)\nBoy was it SPICY, this dish had more then spice though, it had good, hot flavour. Sadly, the eggplant was a little overcooked in my opinion, the tofu was great.\n\nAyam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (BBQ chicken w/ spicy coconut sauce)\nThis was probably my favorite dish of the meal. The chicken was on the bone, booked perfectly, was super juicy and had a great, flavor and spice that was cut by the sweetness of the Coconut Milk Sauce.. WINNER.\n\nKari Udang (Shrimp & Veggies in Coconut Curry Sauce)\nHere we had a very simple dish, I wish I had taken a photo because it was beautiful, colourful, bright, light, it was just so pretty! And it tasted wonderful as well. It was soft in flavor, the shrimp were not over or under cooked, the veggies where crisp yet soft and that coconut curry sauce was to die for.\n\nBubur Ketan Hitam (Black sweet rice w/ fresh coconut milk)\nWow... Wow... Wow... I could have eaten 5 servings of this. I loved that I was given a small bowl with the rice on the bottom and coconut milk on top and was expected to mix it myself, this allowed us to watch the transformation, the rice was hot and heated up the milk, once mixed it looked like chunky slightly melted chocolate and it was HEAVEN in my mouth. The Texture this dish had was really great, slightly chew, milky, pudding like as it started to cool down and the flavor was sweet, the perfect ending to a flavor filled meal!\n\nParking was easy on a Monday around 6:30PM, I nabbed a spot just a few blocks away.\n\nYep, I would totally go here again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Nasi Kari Udang & Telur 8.50 \nRice plate with shrimp curry & vegatables in coconut milk\n\n\n"], "author": "Carlos A.", "review": "Don't let it's location fool you, the food here is for real.

As I rarely eat Indonesian food, I decided to have the Rijsttafel, which was a complete 6 course dinner plus soup, an appetizer, and dessert. (Note: I am basing the dish names off the restaurant's website as I can't remember the names off hand. Apologies in advance for all incorrect statements.)\n\n1. Soto Ayam - Lemon grass soup with bean sprouts, chicken, egg, and green onions. An excellent start to the meal. Just the perfect combination of ingredients to balance each other out. \n\n2. Lumpia Semarang - Fried spring rolls stuffed with chicken, carrots, tofu, and bamboo shoots. Cute appetizer. I would use the peanut sauce. Otherwise, the dish is a bit bland.\n\n3. Chicken Satay with peanut sauce - Wonderful dish. Chicken grilled to perfection. The sauce is not necessary but definitely provides a different taste experience and should be tried by all means.\n\n4. Sambal Goreng Daging - Beef stew in a chili sauce. This goes amazingly well with steamed rice. By far, my favorite dish of the evening. The extra kick of spice puts this item over the top.\n\n5. Bean cake with assorted vegetables - Apologies. I can't remember the name of the dish. Nevertheless, it was my least favorite dish. Let's not mention it again.\n\n6. Ayam Bakar Cabe - BBQ Chicken in a spicy chili sauce. The chicken by itself is fabulous. Very juicy and tender. When you add the sauce, my taste buds are overwhelmed with the different flavors. I recommend putting some sauce on coconut rice. This dish is up there with the beef stew (see #4).\n\n7. Kari Udang - Shrimp with assorted vegetables in a coconut sauce. Not too bad. Wasn't \"wow'ed\" by this dish as with the others but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n8. I can't recall this dish very well. It was nothing to memorable...no pun intended. There were fish crackers/chips (similar to those served in Chinese restaurants) that went with fried pork (i think...) \n\n9. Vanilla ice cream - Pretty self explanatory. Ice cream was standard.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time here. Dishes were pretty much a hit or miss for me, with mostly hits! For $30 (including tip & tax), I feel this is a great bargain.

My gracious host, being born in Indonesia, kindly gave me a taste of local authentic foods from his home country.  Unlike Cantonese cuisine where most local restaurants predominantly use soy sauce or oyster sauce, the flavor profile adds the sour and sweet elements and different textures in unexpected ways.

Our waiter even said that ever since that episode aired they've doubled their business. \n\nSo in our group dinner date one of our friends, Dee, just happens to be Indonesian. So I was like cool, I'm sure she'll let us know if this place is legit. The interesting part was that she said she hadn't tried and recognized many of the dishes on their menu as they are not typical dishes her and her family would eat on a day to day. Much the same as if an Italian person went to the Olive Garden and ordered the Zucca Toscana soup or if a Chinese person went to Panda Express and ate -gasp - Kung Pao chicken. \n\nThe menu had alot of interesting items, so many that we decided to have the waiter make his recommendations on their signature items. \n\n1. The lemongrass soup - it was ok, Mingalaba in Burlingame makes a better lemongrass soup imo. \n\n2. Beef Rendang - the coconut adds a nice smoothness - the beef was tender - our groups consensus favorite. Move over Thai Penang curry, I have a new favorite. \n\n3. BBQ Marinated spicy chicken in special chili sauce - Our group's # 2 favorite dish - the special chili sauce tasted like Mae Ploy. I could replicate this dish at home.  \n\n3. Bakmi Goreng aka Stir fried egg noodle dish - It was aiiight - basically chow mein \n\n4. Ikan Bakar Samudra aka grilled trout fish - This tasted like Indonesia. I can totally picture eating something like this on the beach of one of their islands. \n\n5. Veggie Sampler platter - this one included a soybean cake that Dee said her dad would make for all the time. It came with this spicy peanut butter sauce. \n\nOverall - 3.5 Stars, the food was good, very similar to Thai. I'm happy that I can cross off Indonesian on my foods eaten list.

Added complication if you have a handful of vegetarians and one pesky vegan.  \n\nAnyway - a lot of restaurants can't seem to grasp the concept of preparing buffet-style meals for large groups but Borobudor handles it with ease.\n\nI approached them last week and asked them to come up with a menu for 35 people within a set budget.  They came up with a nicely balanced selection of 3 grilled or stewed meat dishes (chicken satay with a really exceptional peanut sauce) Rendang (a great beef stew) and Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (BBQ marinated chicken in a coconut milk sauce) as well as 3 vegetable dishes - Tahu Terong Balado (eggplant and tofu in chili sauce - really good!) Kari Sayuran (mixed veggies in coconut curry sauce) and Bakmi Goreng (stir fried egg noodles with egg and veggies) plus plenty of steamed rice.\n\nIt was a nice representation of Indonesian cuisine.  The food was delivered hot and on-time in disposable buffet trays.  \n\nWe try a lot of restaurants since we do this every week.  Borobudur has joined the ranks of just a handful that we will repeat every 6 to  8 weeks.  Give them a try - whether for a large event or drop in for lunch.

Hard to tell what it would be like on a weeknight but we came on a Saturday. Good to know they take reservations, though.\n\nSince the Rendang doesn't come with veg, we ordered one vegetarian dish and the Rendang to share and get a good balance.

They do everything by hand, writing out the orders, then as the items are ready, they check the ticket, take it to the right table, and check it off the order list. Because of this, we got our veggie item first, then the Rendang about 10 minutes later.

We gave them our arrival time of 1pm, which is during the busy lunchtime, yet we were still accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered the Gado Gado, which is a warm salad consisting of steamed vegetables, tofu, eggs and shrimp crackers all mixed in a tasty peanut sauce. This is a great dish to get someone who doesn't usually eat vegetables to eat some because the way they prepare it is excellent. We also ordered the Ayam Bakar Cabe which is barbecued marinated spicy chicken with a red chili sauce. The inside of the chicken was a little dry, however, the flavor is unbelievably good. We also got Rendang, which is basically beef brisket cooked in a coconut milk sauce which plenty of spices. This was excellent as the flavor was present in the entire dish, not just the top layer. We also got the Gulai Kambing, which is Lamb cooked in a curry and coconut milk sauce. This was by far my favorite. The curry taste was not overpowering, the lamb, which is usually a strong tasting meat was not overpowering and the entire sauce goes very well with rice. And finally we got the Tumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas, which is just water spinach that has been cooked in a spicy shrimp paste and spicy chili. This totally beats the chinese style that is cooked in just msg and garlic. This is flavorful and for once I was able to finish my vegetables. For drinks we got the Es Teller which is just mixed fruits in a coconut milk and Es Kelapa Muda which is basically just Coconut milk. Both were very refreshing to go with the spicy Indonesian food. And finally for dessert my girlfriend had to order the Es Duren, which is an Indonesian layer cake, where according to my girlfriend, they bake one layer of cake at a time and then they pound it really thin, then they bake another layer and then pound that really thin and layer it again.

Their diverse menu is designed for those who love Indonesia's natural abundance of exotic spices, peanuts, coconuts, (to name a few). Some of their distinctive dishes would surely tease and tantalize while others were not as glorious. There were minor to major hiccups all along the way.\n\nDining solo, I was recommended Rijsttafel ($29.50), a complete Indon rice table where one can sample a wide variety of small courses. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first course, Lumpia Semarang (Indon Spring Roll). It had some nondescript fillings and a side of watered-down peanut sauce. (1/5) After the dismal start, they redeemed themselves almost instantly with a cup of Soto Ayam, a smooth lemon grass soup with chicken. It started off with a subtle blandness and the soup gradually blossomed into an interesting medley of flavors ranging from sweet and sour to fragrant.  Tip: To upgrade the taste, Borobudur sprinkled some deep-fried onions on the soup and it worked wonders! Try doing this at home! (5/5)\n\nThe rest were served together and attractively presented in a huge platter.\n \n1. The first course was Gado Gado, an Indon salad tossed with peanut dressing and topped with shrimp crackers.  The dressing was light, tangy and refreshing, a vast improvement over the spring roll's sauce. (4/5)\n2. Sate Ayam (grilled marinated chicken on skewers with peanut sauce) required high heat and good grilling skills. The aroma can then be smelled from blocks away! Problem with Borobudur's sate was it lacked aroma even when I placed it under my nose! There was no charring (sigh); the meat was dried out and the chewy texture felt like calamari. Not impressed! (2/5)\n3. Now kudos to the cook for not drying out my chicken in the Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak described as BBQ marinated chicken cooked with spicy coconut milk sauce. Firstly, I love the richness and aroma of coconut milk. Secondly, it restored my faith in chicken as if it can be cooked right, it need not be dry! (4/5)\n4. Kari phonetically sounds like curry and so Kari Udang is simply shrimp curry (\"udang\" means shrimps in Indon).  In true Indon style, the curry was simmered in coconut milk and cooked in some secret curry powder or paste. It was hard to believe how the natural sweetness of fresh shrimps blended so tastily with coconut milk and excellent over rice. (4/5)\n5. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe described as \"Saut\u00e9ed Java soy bean and tofu\" was foreign to me. Tempe is a traditional soy product originating from Indon and I am sure available in heath food stores. I figured this must be an acquired taste though not inedible but just not my favorite. (2/5)\n6. Beef Rendang is for sure the tastiest and most iconic Indon dish!  The symphony of tastes was incredible. Without knowing the recipe, my guess the ingredients were sugar, coconut cloves, cinnamon sticks and of course coconut milk that were slow boiled and simmered until the meat was aromatic and amazingly tender. This luscious Indon beef stew was perfect with rice. (5/5)\n\nEverything considered, if you really enjoy the taste of peanuts and coconut milk, I do recommend you give Borobudur a try keeping one eye closed to some inconsistencies in the peanut sauce. I did notice the d\u00e9cor wasn't overbearing but instead quite fascinating and intriguing with traditional woodcarvings hung on the wall with other Indon knickknacks and kitschy artifacts.

"], "author": "Ty T.", "review": "7-September, Saturday\n The rice table (or Dutch 'Rijsttafel') was an elaborate meal of Indonesian dishes developed during the Dutch colonial era. It consists of rice and small platters of food to accompany it to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour accompaniments. The only time I've ever had this was abroad in Amsterdam, but there were about 25-30 different offerings for a meal that was about 2-2.5 hours.\n\nAppetizers: \nLemongrass Soup with Potato & Chicken: I also enjoy spooning a bit of rice and pooling in the broth so that I can taste the rich flavor of the broth. The serving size was just the right amount for a taste (about a mini-bowl's worth), but I could easily eat this as a full meal.\n\nLumpia Semarang, Indonesian fried spring rolls served with peanut dipping sauce. The fillings are similar to the Chinese Popiah (spring roll), but has a mixture of bamboo shoots, chicken & prawn. I really enjoyed these the first time I had them here because I found that they were a bit sweet, which complemented the earthiness of the peanut dipping sauce.\n\nMain Course (with rice included):\n1. Rendang: The Sumatra style beef stew is curried in various spices in coconut milk curry. The quality of the meat very tenderized yet intentionally dry.. yes, it sounds like a weird juxtaposition but the sauce makes it work successfully. This was very nostalgic of my childhood as my grandmother would also makes a similar 'Malaysian' version to this that was a bit spicier, and more along the level of dryness of dehydrated beef, or the American equivalent of 'Jerky.'  The dish often slightly varies from place-to-place, culture to culture.. but I always think about the dry flaky meat as being the catalyst or method of delivery for tasting the sauce (usually ginger, tumeric leaves, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chillies, amongst other spices)\n\n2. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe: sauteed & stir-fried Java soy bean cake Tempe that was caramelized on all sides & white tofu. Rather a simple dish and tasted similarly to the Tumis Kacang Panjang.\n\n3. Sate Ayum: 4x pieces of moist BBQ marinated chicken on skewer (all thigh meat) with peanut dressing. My only critique is that the smoky flavor did not come through as much as I've had with other Indonesian Satays, I was really hoping for the charred flavor to be injected into the meat.\n\n4. Ayum Panggang Bumbu Rujak: 2x pieces of spicy BBQ marinated chicken (with bone) contrasted nicely with the coconut milk sauce. So the end-result is a delicious spicy, yet sweet sensation on your tongue.\n\n5.Kari Udang: prawns in a mildly spicy curry sauce, with chunks of potatoes and eggplant. It goes well with the jasmine rice, but I like to also eat this with chappati, roti chanai, or nasi minyak.\n\n6.

In essence, apps were awesome  \nMany Yelpers raved about the Rendang, but I can say I've had better at Lime Tree in the Sunset at half the price and double the tastiness. The entree that killed it was the noodles, Bakmi Goreng Kari. It had heat and flavor. \n\nService: There are only 2 waitresses working, so service was a little slow. They're really nice, but not the fastest. As well as, pacing of the food. It felt like it took a bit of time for the first app to come before everything slowly arrived.\n\nIt's authentic Indonesia, but I wish our dishes had more flavor.

The roti was a wonderful mix of crispiness and fluffiness. The dipping sauce I thought lacked. It didn't stand out as anything spectacular. It was just a sauce. \n\n#30 Rendang - $14.50 - This dish was recommended by yelp highlights. The beef was very very tender, and fell apart nicely. The sauce was very good.

It's safe to say that I'd come back here if I was in the area. We ordered a lot of dishes, all had large portions and they all tasted pretty well. FYI, I've been to Indonesia and have tried legit indo food, so I'm very picky and critical.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered 3 orders of ground beef Martabak Sapi. Wow were they big! It was pretty tasty and filling. The ground beef was a bit dry, but luckily the rest of the ingredients weren't. It's a great appetizer to share with others, but I'd suggest only eating one or two pieces or else you're going to get full easily.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of my favorite Indonesian dish, beef rendang. The beef was amazingly tender, and it wasn't too dry, but the flavors weren't that strong. The sauce usually has stronger spices for flavor and spiciness. That's what I love about it. Unfortunately, this was definitely my favorite rendang. \n\nWe ordered two orders of Soto betawi, an Indonesian coconut soup with beef, cabbage, potato & tomato. It was pretty tasty, but again, didn't have enough flavor as I'm used to. At least the potatoes, tomatoes, and other dishes were soft and easy to eat. I was just happy that I got to have some for my meal.\n\nI was surprised to see honey chicken on the menu, and have never tried it at an Indonesian restaurant, so we ordered 3 orders of it. The chicken was sweet! I loved it! I love honey and I love chicken, so this combo just made my day! I enjoyed the honey cooked onto the chicken to perfection.

The young coconut milk drink was as expected, but the raspberry soda with condensed milk was an overly sweet Italian soda only sweetened further by the condensed milk.  An intriguing, but ultimately unsuccessful, combination.\n\nOur dishes were as follows:\n\nRoti prata - excellent and as good as any Singaporean restaurant.  Also served with a curry dipping sauce\n\nNasi Goreng - a wonderfully tasty fried rice that we got with chicken.  The portion size wasn't huge and it was literally gone in seconds\n\nLumpia Semarang - fried egg rolls that tasted different mainly due to the tofu, carrots, and slightly different dipping sauce\n\nBihum Goreng - tasty fried noodle dish also with chicken\n\nSpicy Grilled Shrimp on Satay skewers - delicious shrimp with a nice kick of spiciness\n\nBlack rice w/ condensed milk - solid dessert\n\nOverall, the food was quite good and the prices were reasonable.

Empek2 Palembang - Fish cake with egg in the middle served with tangy sauce.\n4.Siomay Bandung - almost like Gado2, but it has less veggies and instead it has fish cakes and chicken dumplings.\n5.

My suggestion is always make a reservation, come early for dinner, and order fairly quickly to beat the rush. We ordered #57:Mie Tek Tek Goreng. which were egg noodles with a rich, spicy sauce.  How delicious!!! We couldn't get enough of so we had to order a second dish of the same to share (not a big portion).  I believe we got the #53: Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas fried rice because the waitress asked if we wanted it very spicy and if we liked shrimp paste, which matches the description on their online menu.  It was soooo spicy that it became painful to eat.  However the pain wasn't enough to stop us from taking bite after bite and serving ourselves more of this generously portioned side dish.  I wish I had ordered the Roti but I forgot. \n\nThe #30 Beef Rendang consisted of several huge chunks of tender beef in a dark, thick, rich, spicy coconut sauce.  It didn't look like much but due to the richness of the sauce we couldn't even finish it.  It wasn't as good as the Honey Chicken which consisted of about 4 medium sized pieces (legs/thighs etc.), but I'm glad we ordered both.  The Honey Chicken didn't have a sticky coating as I expected but simply a sweet flavor surrounding (grilled or BBQ'd?) chicken which was moist and fork tender. Again I wish there had been a larger portion but at least we ordered enough dishes to share with eachother.  Our last dish was #42 Tumis Buncis Pedas Udang Kering or spicy, salty green beans with dried shrimp.  They were delicious and a nice offset to the other dishes.  \n\nI would have passed on the appetizer: #9: Siomay Ayam (goreng/kukus) or steamed chicken dumplings mixed w/seafood in a spicy peanut dipping sauce.  The six small bite-sized, oddly textured morsels were not justified of the price although the sauce was good.  I also felt #21. Pisang Bakar Keju or deep fried plantain wrapped in wonton skin and covered with cheese and chocolate sauce was an abomination of a dish.  WTF were they thinking here?  I expected an Indian Paneer-type cheese but they covered a barely edible plantain with shredded cheddar cheese which did not go at all with the chocolate sauce.  Oh well, #27: Es Campur was sold out but #26: Es Teler was a refreshing shaved ice desert which was too small to share by more than 2 people and quickly devoured!  The other fried plantain and ice cream desert was fine.  The bill was well over $100 but the food was unique and well executed and we enjoyed the service very much.

Slow, forgetful (we asked for Sambal and Ketjap Manis; they said yes, brought the Sambal after a bit but forgot the Ketjap; had to ask again), not attentive, rushed.

(There's no shortage of Thai and Vietnamese though!) For this reason, I really wanted to like Borobudur. Having been here on several occasions, I've been able to try most of the appetizers, both soups, two shrimp dishes, two beef dishes, the saut\u00e9ed garlic water spinach, the nasi goreng, three noodle dishes, and three desserts (see pictures). I was sad to find that nothing really wowed me, with the exception of two desserts. (I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so when dessert is the best part of the meal for me, it usually doesn't bode well for the savoury stuff!)\n\nOf all the appetizers I've had, the three that I would order again are the roti, martabak, and empek empek palembang. The ROTI (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=rzkH1HTiuaZLCdv8H4PGEw) is crispy on the outside with soft layers on the inside, but at $7.50 is pricey for what it is. The MARTABAK (beef or vegetables, egg, and onion in crispy dough; http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=CwZcbd0CfcsM3dar3N2rgg) is great paired with the pickled cucumbers it's served with and I loved the crispiness of the dough. The spicy vinegar in the EMPEK EMPEK PALEMBANG (fried fish cake filled with egg in spicy vinegar, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=3losVCZodB6IIJcb7H-hMA) is yummy and the dish comes with a small amount of vermicelli.\n\nAnother dish I think is worth repeating is the MIE TEK TEK, both stir fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=KvHtA3u3MX7cpA_4CcEBnw) and soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=jMTY7M9VtzmSZ54qX_iqcA) versions. Both are flavourful and loaded with chicken and vegetables. While the coconut curry soup wasn't the best I've had, it's still worth a try. The other soups were also pretty good and I'll likely order them again (mostly because I can't find them anywhere else!), but I wouldn't repeat the beef or shrimp dishes I had.\n\nFor dessert, I love the BLACK SWEET RICE WITH COCONUT MILK and roti prata manis. The black sweet rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=cK_5RuC3hkPcLwPc8GWsZg) has a chocolate-y flavour and the bits of sweet rice add texture. It's better served hot so be sure to ask them to heat it up (it was barely lukewarm both times I got it). The ROTI PRATA MANIS (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=imC4Q1hWGKXTcDqOE5aWAQ) is filled with condensed milk, ground peanut, chocolate, and cheese. Yup, you read that right - cheese. CHEDDAR cheese, to be exact (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=uLo6Zw-XuCaIIunwSg6YBQ). Some people top their apple pie with a slice of cheddar, so I suppose this isn't that out there. Surprisingly, this dish worked out amazingly. The cheddar wasn't too strong but added a hint of saltiness along with the peanuts to balance out the sweetness. It also added a creaminess to the dish. Paired with the crispy/chewy roti, this is hands down my favourite dish here.\n\nStay away from the fried banana though! Instead of a coating that is thin and crispy, it's thick, doughy, and mushy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=kNCzXgZ0JJxc98Y5uB0Q7A).

It's safe to say that I'd come back here if I was in the area. We ordered a lot of dishes, all had large portions and they all tasted pretty well. FYI, I've been to Indonesia and have tried legit indo food, so I'm very picky and critical.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered 3 orders of ground beef Martabak Sapi. Wow were they big! It was pretty tasty and filling. The ground beef was a bit dry, but luckily the rest of the ingredients weren't. It's a great appetizer to share with others, but I'd suggest only eating one or two pieces or else you're going to get full easily.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of my favorite Indonesian dish, beef rendang. The beef was amazingly tender, and it wasn't too dry, but the flavors weren't that strong. The sauce usually has stronger spices for flavor and spiciness. That's what I love about it. Unfortunately, this was definitely my favorite rendang. \n\nWe ordered two orders of Soto betawi, an Indonesian coconut soup with beef, cabbage, potato & tomato. It was pretty tasty, but again, didn't have enough flavor as I'm used to. At least the potatoes, tomatoes, and other dishes were soft and easy to eat. I was just happy that I got to have some for my meal.\n\nI was surprised to see honey chicken on the menu, and have never tried it at an Indonesian restaurant, so we ordered 3 orders of it. The chicken was sweet! I loved it! I love honey and I love chicken, so this combo just made my day! I enjoyed the honey cooked onto the chicken to perfection. To me, it felt like the honey definitely stuck on the chicken well.\n\nLastly, we ordered 3 dishes of some carbs: Nasi Goreng (regular Indonesian fried rice for those who cannot take spicy food, Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas (tTraditional spicy shrimp paste fried rice with egg, onion), and Bakmi Goreng (stir fried egg noodle with egg & vegetables), all with chicken.

She is the only one there (other than kitchen staff), so yes, service can be rather slow, so just make sure you want to have a leisurely time when you have a meal here.\n\nI read many reviews that were disappointed with the food. To prevent that, order only the food I recommend. :) Oh, btw, everything served in this restaurant is Halal.\n\nMy recommendations (in order of my preference):\n\nVegetarian:\n1. Lumpia Semarang - Special Fried Spring Roll - it has bamboo shoots in it. Semarang is the city where this dish is famous for.\n2. Gado-gado - cooked salad with peanut sauce. \nRemember it is cooked. So if you like you salad raw and crunchy, dont order this.\n3. Corn fritters - fried corn with green onions and chillies.\n4. Tempe - Oseng2 or Fried - this soy bean cake has a very distinct flavor. You either love it or hate it. I used to hate it when I was a kid.\n\nNon-vegetarians:\n1. Mie Tek2 Goreng - Fried Noodles.\n2. Mie Tek2 Kuah - The same noodles as above but with soup.\n3. Empek2 Palembang - Fish cake with egg in the middle served with tangy sauce.\n4.Siomay Bandung - almost like Gado2, but it has less veggies and instead it has fish cakes and chicken dumplings.\n5. Ayam Bakar Cabe - Grilled Chicken\n6. Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak - Grilled Chicken with Coconut Chili Sauce\n7. Rendang - Beef Stew\n8. Soto Ayam/Soto Betawi - Chcken/Beef Soup\n9. Kangkung Sambal Terasi - Water Spinach with Shrimp Paste\n10. Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas with Salted Fish - Only for the brave!\n\nDon't order the Nasi Rames/Uduk/Padang. Don't order Rijstafel.\n\nDessert:\n1. Es Campur - Shaved Ice with tropical fruits - much better than Es Teler.\n2. Es Kelapa Muda - Young Coconut\n3. Roti Prata Manis - not exactly Indonesian, but it's good\n4. Bubur Ketan Hitam - black glutinous rice with coconut sauce.\n\nThey usually open a vendor booth on Indonesia Day (at least they did on 2010) and they usually sell more variety than what they have in their regular menu on that day.

We found the young waitress to be personable and friendly, as well as her Father (?).  We also noticed the small restaurant filled up very quickly and then the few servers scrambled to get good service to everyone.  My suggestion is always make a reservation, come early for dinner, and order fairly quickly to beat the rush. We ordered #57:Mie Tek Tek Goreng. which were egg noodles with a rich, spicy sauce.  How delicious!!! We couldn't get enough of so we had to order a second dish of the same to share (not a big portion).  I believe we got the #53: Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas fried rice because the waitress asked if we wanted it very spicy and if we liked shrimp paste, which matches the description on their online menu.  It was soooo spicy that it became painful to eat.  However the pain wasn't enough to stop us from taking bite after bite and serving ourselves more of this generously portioned side dish.  I wish I had ordered the Roti but I forgot. \n\nThe #30 Beef Rendang consisted of several huge chunks of tender beef in a dark, thick, rich, spicy coconut sauce.  It didn't look like much but due to the richness of the sauce we couldn't even finish it.  It wasn't as good as the Honey Chicken which consisted of about 4 medium sized pieces (legs/thighs etc.), but I'm glad we ordered both.  The Honey Chicken didn't have a sticky coating as I expected but simply a sweet flavor surrounding (grilled or BBQ'd?) chicken which was moist and fork tender. Again I wish there had been a larger portion but at least we ordered enough dishes to share with eachother.  Our last dish was #42 Tumis Buncis Pedas Udang Kering or spicy, salty green beans with dried shrimp.  They were delicious and a nice offset to the other dishes.  \n\nI would have passed on the appetizer: #9: Siomay Ayam (goreng/kukus) or steamed chicken dumplings mixed w/seafood in a spicy peanut dipping sauce.  The six small bite-sized, oddly textured morsels were not justified of the price although the sauce was good.  I also felt #21. Pisang Bakar Keju or deep fried plantain wrapped in wonton skin and covered with cheese and chocolate sauce was an abomination of a dish.  WTF were they thinking here?  I expected an Indian Paneer-type cheese but they covered a barely edible plantain with shredded cheddar cheese which did not go at all with the chocolate sauce.  Oh well, #27: Es Campur was sold out but #26: Es Teler was a refreshing shaved ice desert which was too small to share by more than 2 people and quickly devoured!  The other fried plantain and ice cream desert was fine.  The bill was well over $100 but the food was unique and well executed and we enjoyed the service very much.  Although we've only been to Bali and not Jakarta where this family is from, there were many Indonesians eating here so I believe it must be decently authentic.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["For example, the nasi goreng terasi pedas was pungent and aromatic (not for the faint hearted, especially those who don't care for anything reminiscent of fish sauce).

The verdict? \nGood ol' fashioned comfort food for the Southeast Asian-inclined! You could tell from all the Bahasa Indonesia being spoken around us that I wasn't alone in this sentiment. Throw in the cleanliness of the place and the friendly staff and it's definitely a winner in my book. \n\nThe Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas (fried rice w/ spicy shrimp paste) is an absolute must! The Ayam Bakar Cabe (BBQ spicy chicken) is wonderfully tender and flavorful. Get the Empal Goreng (fried honey beef) for its sweetness and texture. The Capcai (mixed veggies) was okay, but I'd skip it next time. \n\nFor more discriminating palates (e.g. my parents), the dishes were simple but fairly authentic.

The coconut curry was lacking heat and the veggies could have used a few more minutes in the pot; they were a bit toothsome for my taste.

Unfortunately Borobudur did not have Nasi Bungkus on the menu so I decided to get another rice based dish called Nasi Uduk Lenkap ($12.95) to-go using the online ordering app on Yelp.\n\nAfter ordering, I landed up after about 20 minutes to find the restaurant half full with one large party waiting for a table. The servers and hostess were busy running around, taking orders and busing tables so I walked over to the counter to see if my order was ready. Well it was ready so I was literally handed a to-go container. No bag, no silverware nothing just a box and I was to be on my way. Just as I was about to leave some other lady stepped in took the box from my hand and put it in a bag and provided silverware. It's nice that she did this else I would have been very upset. They had charged me 25c for the SF bag fee, which is just wrong. SF bag fee is only 10c and that too if they are providing a thick plastic bag.\n\nAnyway, let's come to the food.

I eat it almost everyday. Well, I am from Indonesia after all, but hey, I am not biased, k? ;p \nBorobudur is one of my favorite place to eat (when I am too lazy too cook). \n\nFor many, Indonesian food is similar to other Southeast Asian cuisine such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, or even as far as India ('curry' dish is everywhere, isn't it?). However, to be fair, no cuisine from different country is exactly alike since different set of spices is used, thus giving the cuisine its unique flavor of that particular country. \n\nWhy I like Borobudur? The food, of course! Decor is minimal at best, but for a delicious treat, who would care? (as long as the place is clean) The staff is curteous, and eager to answer your inquiries on the food or what to order. Sometimes it may take a while for your order to come out. It is almost random ... well, if you understand the Indonesian term for \"rubber clock\" then perhaps you could understand this better. ^^;\n\nOk, about the food here (geez... finally.... ). You gotta know what to order (doh!) especially facing a menu with strange names you never even heard of, let alone pronounced it. \n\nFirst, to appease your stomach while waiting for the dishes to come out, I'd suggest ordering the Kerupuk Palembang, a big fish craker (it looks like thick white noodles and round in shape, you will see it displayed behind the register area). It is served with peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce. Other appetizer you may want to try is Otak-otak (don't ask what the name literally mean, ok? Trust me it is far from that ^^), and Lumpia Semarang (Indonesian version of spring roll). And remind the server to serve the drinks first, .\n\nOh right, the drinks! You got to try the Es Cendol (my fav!). It is tiny-tiny green colored jello made from rice flour served in a glass of palm sugar mixed with coconut milk. \n\nI like to start with Empek-Empek, which is a fried fish-cake with egg inside, served in a bowl of spicy-tangy dark color soup. Guaranteed to increase your appetite!\n\nAyam Kalasan is very popular in Indonesia, and Borobudur offers a mouthwatering version of it. For beef dish, I usually order Beef Rendang. It is soft and juicy and infused with spices and flavor. Beef satay? Hm... I would shift away from beef-on-a-stick, for simple reason, most of the time it will be either too dry, or too cooked, and too chewy. Just stick with the rendang. \n\nFor you spicy food lover, may I suggest Mie Tek-Tek? Be warned that their 'Mild' version of the this soupy dish is still considered quite spicy (even for me). I would order the 'dry' version because it is bearable (you can still taste other food you ordered after eating this) and easier to share with your table mates. \n\nWhen going there solo or you just don't feel like doing it 'family style' my suggestion is Mie Ayam (Chicken Noodle) or Nasi Uduk (fragrant rice).  \n\nAnd to close your dining adventure in Indonesian cuisine: I know this might be weird for a lot of people, but keep an open mind (or tongue) ok? For dessert, order the Pisang Bakar. It is grilled banana, served with cheese, chocolate and condensed milk (what the????? ;p ) Yup! you got it right ^^ \nIt is a strange combo or sweet-salty-fruity-chocolatey.

"], "author": "Ty T.", "review": "7-September, Saturday\n The rice table (or Dutch 'Rijsttafel') was an elaborate meal of Indonesian dishes developed during the Dutch colonial era. It consists of rice and small platters of food to accompany it to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour accompaniments. The only time I've ever had this was abroad in Amsterdam, but there were about 25-30 different offerings for a meal that was about 2-2.5 hours.\n\nAppetizers: \nLemongrass Soup with Potato & Chicken: I also enjoy spooning a bit of rice and pooling in the broth so that I can taste the rich flavor of the broth. The serving size was just the right amount for a taste (about a mini-bowl's worth), but I could easily eat this as a full meal.\n\nLumpia Semarang, Indonesian fried spring rolls served with peanut dipping sauce. The fillings are similar to the Chinese Popiah (spring roll), but has a mixture of bamboo shoots, chicken & prawn. I really enjoyed these the first time I had them here because I found that they were a bit sweet, which complemented the earthiness of the peanut dipping sauce.\n\nMain Course (with rice included):\n1. Rendang: The Sumatra style beef stew is curried in various spices in coconut milk curry. The quality of the meat very tenderized yet intentionally dry.. yes, it sounds like a weird juxtaposition but the sauce makes it work successfully. This was very nostalgic of my childhood as my grandmother would also makes a similar 'Malaysian' version to this that was a bit spicier, and more along the level of dryness of dehydrated beef, or the American equivalent of 'Jerky.'  The dish often slightly varies from place-to-place, culture to culture.. but I always think about the dry flaky meat as being the catalyst or method of delivery for tasting the sauce (usually ginger, tumeric leaves, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chillies, amongst other spices)\n\n2. Oseng Oseng Tahu Tempe: sauteed & stir-fried Java soy bean cake Tempe that was caramelized on all sides & white tofu. Rather a simple dish and tasted similarly to the Tumis Kacang Panjang.\n\n3. Sate Ayum: 4x pieces of moist BBQ marinated chicken on skewer (all thigh meat) with peanut dressing. My only critique is that the smoky flavor did not come through as much as I've had with other Indonesian Satays, I was really hoping for the charred flavor to be injected into the meat.\n\n4. Ayum Panggang Bumbu Rujak: 2x pieces of spicy BBQ marinated chicken (with bone) contrasted nicely with the coconut milk sauce. So the end-result is a delicious spicy, yet sweet sensation on your tongue.\n\n5.Kari Udang: prawns in a mildly spicy curry sauce, with chunks of potatoes and eggplant. It goes well with the jasmine rice, but I like to also eat this with chappati, roti chanai, or nasi minyak.\n\n6. Gado-Gado/ Salade: blanched vegetables, tofu, potato, & egg covered in peanut dressing.. I only have had a Javanese 'Lotek' variation of this prior which is the same concept of various veggies covered in peanut sauce, except the veggies in that case are raw so you taste more of the crisp. Both topped with plain emping crackers (which are equally as tasty eaten by itself as a snack, or gently crushed into some lontong sayur). I thought that this version was a bit sauce heavy -but can easily be diluted with rice.\n\nDessert: \n1. Vanilla Ice Cream -creamy, lightly fragrant & sweet, garnished with a sour cherry.\n2. Black Sweet Rice with Coconut Milk: short grained and dark purple in flavor, very glutinous and sticky in texture. This is always a refreshing treat for me because it is warm, creamy, sweet from the toasted coconut, and a little savory.\n\nThis was a more focused version of it, with most curried meats, and peanut dressing.

We also noticed the small restaurant filled up very quickly and then the few servers scrambled to get good service to everyone.  My suggestion is always make a reservation, come early for dinner, and order fairly quickly to beat the rush. We ordered #57:Mie Tek Tek Goreng. which were egg noodles with a rich, spicy sauce.  How delicious!!! We couldn't get enough of so we had to order a second dish of the same to share (not a big portion).  I believe we got the #53: Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas fried rice because the waitress asked if we wanted it very spicy and if we liked shrimp paste, which matches the description on their online menu.  It was soooo spicy that it became painful to eat.  However the pain wasn't enough to stop us from taking bite after bite and serving ourselves more of this generously portioned side dish.  I wish I had ordered the Roti but I forgot. \n\nThe #30 Beef Rendang consisted of several huge chunks of tender beef in a dark, thick, rich, spicy coconut sauce.  It didn't look like much but due to the richness of the sauce we couldn't even finish it.  It wasn't as good as the Honey Chicken which consisted of about 4 medium sized pieces (legs/thighs etc.), but I'm glad we ordered both.  The Honey Chicken didn't have a sticky coating as I expected but simply a sweet flavor surrounding (grilled or BBQ'd?) chicken which was moist and fork tender. Again I wish there had been a larger portion but at least we ordered enough dishes to share with eachother.  Our last dish was #42 Tumis Buncis Pedas Udang Kering or spicy, salty green beans with dried shrimp.  They were delicious and a nice offset to the other dishes.  \n\nI would have passed on the appetizer: #9: Siomay Ayam (goreng/kukus) or steamed chicken dumplings mixed w/seafood in a spicy peanut dipping sauce.  The six small bite-sized, oddly textured morsels were not justified of the price although the sauce was good.  I also felt #21. Pisang Bakar Keju or deep fried plantain wrapped in wonton skin and covered with cheese and chocolate sauce was an abomination of a dish.  WTF were they thinking here?  I expected an Indian Paneer-type cheese but they covered a barely edible plantain with shredded cheddar cheese which did not go at all with the chocolate sauce.  Oh well, #27: Es Campur was sold out but #26: Es Teler was a refreshing shaved ice desert which was too small to share by more than 2 people and quickly devoured!  The other fried plantain and ice cream desert was fine.  The bill was well over $100 but the food was unique and well executed and we enjoyed the service very much.

The spicy vinegar in the EMPEK EMPEK PALEMBANG (fried fish cake filled with egg in spicy vinegar, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=3losVCZodB6IIJcb7H-hMA) is yummy and the dish comes with a small amount of vermicelli.\n\nAnother dish I think is worth repeating is the MIE TEK TEK, both stir fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=KvHtA3u3MX7cpA_4CcEBnw) and soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=jMTY7M9VtzmSZ54qX_iqcA) versions. Both are flavourful and loaded with chicken and vegetables. While the coconut curry soup wasn't the best I've had, it's still worth a try. The other soups were also pretty good and I'll likely order them again (mostly because I can't find them anywhere else!), but I wouldn't repeat the beef or shrimp dishes I had.\n\nFor dessert, I love the BLACK SWEET RICE WITH COCONUT MILK and roti prata manis. The black sweet rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=cK_5RuC3hkPcLwPc8GWsZg) has a chocolate-y flavour and the bits of sweet rice add texture. It's better served hot so be sure to ask them to heat it up (it was barely lukewarm both times I got it). The ROTI PRATA MANIS (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=imC4Q1hWGKXTcDqOE5aWAQ) is filled with condensed milk, ground peanut, chocolate, and cheese. Yup, you read that right - cheese. CHEDDAR cheese, to be exact (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=uLo6Zw-XuCaIIunwSg6YBQ). Some people top their apple pie with a slice of cheddar, so I suppose this isn't that out there. Surprisingly, this dish worked out amazingly. The cheddar wasn't too strong but added a hint of saltiness along with the peanuts to balance out the sweetness. It also added a creaminess to the dish. Paired with the crispy/chewy roti, this is hands down my favourite dish here.\n\nStay away from the fried banana though! Instead of a coating that is thin and crispy, it's thick, doughy, and mushy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VZwe5P-at3JYNCxOVSfe-g?select=kNCzXgZ0JJxc98Y5uB0Q7A).

However, the soup is dynamite. I will definitely be ordering it again.\nThe fish cakes (empek Palembang) were pretty good, but didn't stand out. \nThe Rendang beef is reallllllllllllly tender and very tasty and goes perfect w/ Nasi Uduk\nThe Es Cendol was very sweet and I liked it.\nThe service was not bad, and we didn't experience any crazy delay or lack of eye-contact..

So one day on a whim we decided to drive all the way to San Francisco from Fremont, and we went to Borobudur.\n\nIndonesian food takes pretty long to prepare, and since my girlfriend and I were planning on only staying for about an hour, she suggested that we called and ordered. We gave them our arrival time of 1pm, which is during the busy lunchtime, yet we were still accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered the Gado Gado, which is a warm salad consisting of steamed vegetables, tofu, eggs and shrimp crackers all mixed in a tasty peanut sauce. This is a great dish to get someone who doesn't usually eat vegetables to eat some because the way they prepare it is excellent. We also ordered the Ayam Bakar Cabe which is barbecued marinated spicy chicken with a red chili sauce. The inside of the chicken was a little dry, however, the flavor is unbelievably good. We also got Rendang, which is basically beef brisket cooked in a coconut milk sauce which plenty of spices. This was excellent as the flavor was present in the entire dish, not just the top layer. We also got the Gulai Kambing, which is Lamb cooked in a curry and coconut milk sauce. This was by far my favorite. The curry taste was not overpowering, the lamb, which is usually a strong tasting meat was not overpowering and the entire sauce goes very well with rice. And finally we got the Tumis Kangkung Terasi Pedas, which is just water spinach that has been cooked in a spicy shrimp paste and spicy chili. This totally beats the chinese style that is cooked in just msg and garlic. This is flavorful and for once I was able to finish my vegetables. For drinks we got the Es Teller which is just mixed fruits in a coconut milk and Es Kelapa Muda which is basically just Coconut milk. Both were very refreshing to go with the spicy Indonesian food. And finally for dessert my girlfriend had to order the Es Duren, which is an Indonesian layer cake, where according to my girlfriend, they bake one layer of cake at a time and then they pound it really thin, then they bake another layer and then pound that really thin and layer it again. I guess Indonesian people like food that takes absurdly long to prepare, but I definitely am not complaining =).\n\nOur total bill came out to be around 80 dollars; 100 dollars for 2 people including tip.

Here's what my gracious hosts ordered:\n\nAppetizers\n 1) Tempe Goreng (fried soy bean cake) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LwQKt_v47NtrhUOR6mpndw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Drier that Chinese style fried tofu, this is more dense and interesting with the dipping sauce.\n\n2) Empek Empek Palembang (Fried fish cake filled with egg in spicy vinegar) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1RNYxo-5nPJZb0O25cEFvw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Nice flavor contrast and textures; wish the egg was more runny, but this is done traditional style.  Favorite of the three apps.\n\n3) Gado-gado (Steamed vegetables, tofu, potato, egg, & shrimp cracker with peanut dressing) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA#5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA) - Plethora of textures and flavors.\n\nMain\n 4) Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with coconut milk) - Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA#k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA) - Looks more like a curry preparation so the seasonings are unexpected; meat was tender.\n\n5) Empal Goreng (Fried marinated honey beef) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w#tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w) - Like the soy bean cake, this is dryer and comparable to beef jerky.\n\n6) Tumis Kangkung Bawang Putih (Sauteed water spinach with garlic) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)  - Seasonal, this is my favorite Asian vegetable, cooked and seasoned just right.\n\n7)  Ikan Bakar Sumudra / Trout fish (Grilled fish with tropical spices) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Flaky and tasty, reminds me of smoked fish.\n\nDesserts\n 8) Bubur Ketan Hitam - Black sweet rice - Least favorite of the three desserts as very filling.\n\n9) Es Cendol (Rice flour cake with ice & palm sugar syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw#_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw) - Think of an icy Thai iced tea with grass jelly and gelatinous textured accompaniments.\n\n10) Es Campur (Mixed tropical fruits with shave ice, condensed milk, chocolate & raspberry syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Shave ice - My favorite of the three desserts, the chocolate and raspberry flavors are unexpected.\n\nBeing my maiden voyage in Indonesian cuisine, the variety highlighted this roller coaster of a meal as many of the foods did not taste like they \"looked\".  My gracious host, being born in Indonesia, kindly gave me a taste of local authentic foods from his home country.  Unlike Cantonese cuisine where most local restaurants predominantly use soy sauce or oyster sauce, the flavor profile adds the sour and sweet elements and different textures in unexpected ways.  If you are adventurous and not afraid to try something new, you will likely enjoy this, but make sure you bring someone in the know to guide you.

This combined with Nasi Uduk (coconut rice) and Tumis Bayam Bawang Putih (sauteed spinach with tofu and garlic) put my stomach and taste buds in Indonesian food heaven. The husband droolingly chowed down on Nasi Padang (a spicy Sumatran-style rice combination platter), which he said was \"Enak banget\" (really good). Not to mention a plate of Emping (which the restaurant calls bitter cracker- don't let that scare you away, it's actually not bitter, and has that nice salty crunch that anyone who truly loves Indonesian food needs in addition to the other flavors and consistencies). To drink, we went for Kopi Jawa (coffee with sweetened condensed milk)- you can't eat any good Indonesian food without savoring a true cup of Java.

I eat it almost everyday. Well, I am from Indonesia after all, but hey, I am not biased, k? ;p \nBorobudur is one of my favorite place to eat (when I am too lazy too cook). \n\nFor many, Indonesian food is similar to other Southeast Asian cuisine such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, or even as far as India ('curry' dish is everywhere, isn't it?). However, to be fair, no cuisine from different country is exactly alike since different set of spices is used, thus giving the cuisine its unique flavor of that particular country. \n\nWhy I like Borobudur? The food, of course! Decor is minimal at best, but for a delicious treat, who would care? (as long as the place is clean) The staff is curteous, and eager to answer your inquiries on the food or what to order. Sometimes it may take a while for your order to come out. It is almost random ... well, if you understand the Indonesian term for \"rubber clock\" then perhaps you could understand this better. ^^;\n\nOk, about the food here (geez... finally.... ). You gotta know what to order (doh!) especially facing a menu with strange names you never even heard of, let alone pronounced it. \n\nFirst, to appease your stomach while waiting for the dishes to come out, I'd suggest ordering the Kerupuk Palembang, a big fish craker (it looks like thick white noodles and round in shape, you will see it displayed behind the register area). It is served with peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce. Other appetizer you may want to try is Otak-otak (don't ask what the name literally mean, ok? Trust me it is far from that ^^), and Lumpia Semarang (Indonesian version of spring roll). And remind the server to serve the drinks first, .\n\nOh right, the drinks! You got to try the Es Cendol (my fav!). It is tiny-tiny green colored jello made from rice flour served in a glass of palm sugar mixed with coconut milk. \n\nI like to start with Empek-Empek, which is a fried fish-cake with egg inside, served in a bowl of spicy-tangy dark color soup. Guaranteed to increase your appetite!\n\nAyam Kalasan is very popular in Indonesia, and Borobudur offers a mouthwatering version of it. For beef dish, I usually order Beef Rendang. It is soft and juicy and infused with spices and flavor. Beef satay? Hm... I would shift away from beef-on-a-stick, for simple reason, most of the time it will be either too dry, or too cooked, and too chewy. Just stick with the rendang. \n\nFor you spicy food lover, may I suggest Mie Tek-Tek? Be warned that their 'Mild' version of the this soupy dish is still considered quite spicy (even for me). I would order the 'dry' version because it is bearable (you can still taste other food you ordered after eating this) and easier to share with your table mates. \n\nWhen going there solo or you just don't feel like doing it 'family style' my suggestion is Mie Ayam (Chicken Noodle) or Nasi Uduk (fragrant rice).  \n\nAnd to close your dining adventure in Indonesian cuisine: I know this might be weird for a lot of people, but keep an open mind (or tongue) ok? For dessert, order the Pisang Bakar. It is grilled banana, served with cheese, chocolate and condensed milk (what the????? ;p ) Yup! you got it right ^^ \nIt is a strange combo or sweet-salty-fruity-chocolatey. It is a typical late-night snack for the young (and old) in Jakarta.

Then 4 years ago I went with my friend Vera who happens to be from Jakarta. Well I went to Jakarta and Bali this past fall and for some reason hadn't made it to Borobudur since I had been back. A friend & I had been talking about going here and so we finally made it this past week; coupled with some further reminiscencing I went again 2 days later. \n\nhere is my take-away:\n\nThe first visit on Wednesday we had:\n- Mie Tek Tek\n- Empek Palembang\n- Rendang w/ Nasi Uduk \n- Es Cendol \n\nThe Mie Tek Tek was not that spicy to us, but we both LOVE prik nam pla so go figure. However, the soup is dynamite. I will definitely be ordering it again.\nThe fish cakes (empek Palembang) were pretty good, but didn't stand out. \nThe Rendang beef is reallllllllllllly tender and very tasty and goes perfect w/ Nasi Uduk\nThe Es Cendol was very sweet and I liked it.\nThe service was not bad, and we didn't experience any crazy delay or lack of eye-contact.. I even threw out some of the bahasa that I knew and got some favorable smiles and reactions back from the server.\n\nFast forward to Friday..\n\nMy other friend is not so much into spicy stuff, so we skipped the Mie Tek Tek\n- Roti Prata \n- Nasi Goreng w/vegetables\n- Kari Sayuran\n- Es Cendol and Es Kelapa Muda\n\nThe Roti is very good but kinda oily. but who cares.. use a fork if you are that worried about your hands getting greasy (when I was in Jakarta there were several meals w/ my friends where they dont use utensils at all, so when in Rome, do as the Romans do).. but if u don't want the oily bread, skip it\nThe Nasi Goreng was definitely slamming!! then mix that with the Kari Sayuran ... ohh mannnn .. \nThe Kari Sayuran was good by itself, but I enjoyed it a lot w/ the nasi goreng dish\nThis time, the Es Cendol was just too sweet. I could only take a few sips of it and I was done. \nThis time, it was more crowded, but of course, it's Friday night, prime time dinner slot. They had 2 servers though, and there was really no delay.. so I think it's a hit or miss folks.. but I tried it twice in one week, and there was not the same shift of staff there.\n\nAll I could say at end of both meals.. \"Saya Kenyang!!\"  (I'm full)\n\nI really miss Indonesia and want to go back very badly.  Indonesian food  is some of the spiciest of any cuisine that I have eaten. Some other classic Indonesian dishes to try if you have never eaten Indo: Gadox2, Soto Ayam, Mie Goreng, Sop Buntut... ohh there is so much..  I wish that Borobudur had some authentic Padang dishes as that is known as some of the spiciest styles found in Indonesia\n\nCheck out this pic below of my first Sundanese/javanese meal on my second day in Jakarta. This is known as Gurami Fish.. you eat the tail and everything ;)\n\nI am going to have to go try the other Indo resto 1 block down.\n\nADA APA!!?!??!?!\n\n[IMG]http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l217/kapshure/DSCF1157.jpg[/IMG]", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-04-28"}, {"excerpts": ["try the delicious drink Es Cendol!

My suggestion is always make a reservation, come early for dinner, and order fairly quickly to beat the rush. We ordered #57:Mie Tek Tek Goreng. which were egg noodles with a rich, spicy sauce.  How delicious!!! We couldn't get enough of so we had to order a second dish of the same to share (not a big portion).  I believe we got the #53: Nasi Goreng Terasi Pedas fried rice because the waitress asked if we wanted it very spicy and if we liked shrimp paste, which matches the description on their online menu.  It was soooo spicy that it became painful to eat.  However the pain wasn't enough to stop us from taking bite after bite and serving ourselves more of this generously portioned side dish.  I wish I had ordered the Roti but I forgot. \n\nThe #30 Beef Rendang consisted of several huge chunks of tender beef in a dark, thick, rich, spicy coconut sauce.  It didn't look like much but due to the richness of the sauce we couldn't even finish it.  It wasn't as good as the Honey Chicken which consisted of about 4 medium sized pieces (legs/thighs etc.), but I'm glad we ordered both.  The Honey Chicken didn't have a sticky coating as I expected but simply a sweet flavor surrounding (grilled or BBQ'd?) chicken which was moist and fork tender. Again I wish there had been a larger portion but at least we ordered enough dishes to share with eachother.  Our last dish was #42 Tumis Buncis Pedas Udang Kering or spicy, salty green beans with dried shrimp.

The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that even though I am Chinese, I was expecting to try some really exotic Indonesian flavors but everything seemed familiar to what I've had in Chinese, Malaysian or Singaporean cuisine. Not to say it wasn't delicious, I was just interested to try something new to my taste buds. \n\nAppetizers: \nCombo Satay- perfectly grilled, the chicken was tender and juicy, the beef was seasoned perfectly, the peanut sauce was creamy and yummy.\nLumpia - Egg roll was good but nothing special. I've had tastier lumpias in daly city Filipino dives.\nRoti Prata - Tasty and the dipping sauce was good- a blend of curry and spices.\n\nEntrees:\nRendang  - beef stew with coconut milk - the highlight of the evening in my eyes. The beef was super tender and flavorful and the broth was exceptional. I could eat four bowls of rice with this stuff.\nHoney Chicken - The meat falls off the bone. Best part was that it wasn't dry and..... the marinade penetrated into the flesh of the bird. Usually the skin and top part of chicken has good flavor but as you get towards the middle the flavor is not evident. Not so with this dish as you can taste the flavor on all of the meat.\nGrilled fish with Indonesian Salsa and tropical spices - the fish was perfectly cooked, and it was tasty, but the spices and salsa wasn't anything special. To me it was a dish I could make at home.\nSauteed veggies - ok I really wanted water spinach with shrimp paste but since it was out of season, the server suggested the sauteed veggies. Again it was cooked perfectly and seasoned right, but nothing special and something I could get at any Chinese restaurant in the Sunset.\n\nDrinks: So I ordered one of their special drinks called Es Teler, which as their menu states is \"mixed sweetened fruits with coconut milk & ice\". It was $4.50 and I would say a huge waste of money. They just basically put in some canned tropical fruit, canned jackfruit, canned coconut milk and ice and called it a day. Order the Thai iced tea or Indonesian ice coffee instead as those tasted much better.\n\nOverall I thought the food was good, around a 3.5, however the rendang pushed it up to a four for me.

Here's what my gracious hosts ordered:\n\nAppetizers\n 1) Tempe Goreng (fried soy bean cake) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LwQKt_v47NtrhUOR6mpndw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Drier that Chinese style fried tofu, this is more dense and interesting with the dipping sauce.\n\n2) Empek Empek Palembang (Fried fish cake filled with egg in spicy vinegar) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1RNYxo-5nPJZb0O25cEFvw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Nice flavor contrast and textures; wish the egg was more runny, but this is done traditional style.  Favorite of the three apps.\n\n3) Gado-gado (Steamed vegetables, tofu, potato, egg, & shrimp cracker with peanut dressing) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA#5okBb0nmsZyG2bOedQCmIA) - Plethora of textures and flavors.\n\nMain\n 4) Ayam Panggang Bumbu Rujak (B.B.Q. marinated chicken cooked with coconut milk) - Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA#k_XrDaXKXEEzwcuQwLnejA) - Looks more like a curry preparation so the seasonings are unexpected; meat was tender.\n\n5) Empal Goreng (Fried marinated honey beef) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w#tWM2je4Z7IOuWGzh97mh3w) - Like the soy bean cake, this is dryer and comparable to beef jerky.\n\n6) Tumis Kangkung Bawang Putih (Sauteed water spinach with garlic) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)  - Seasonal, this is my favorite Asian vegetable, cooked and seasoned just right.\n\n7)  Ikan Bakar Sumudra / Trout fish (Grilled fish with tropical spices) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Flaky and tasty, reminds me of smoked fish.\n\nDesserts\n 8) Bubur Ketan Hitam - Black sweet rice - Least favorite of the three desserts as very filling.\n\n9) Es Cendol (Rice flour cake with ice & palm sugar syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/borobudur-restaurant-san-francisco?select=_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw#_c9VJLJZ5chJ0ar_l2IEjw) - Think of an icy Thai iced tea with grass jelly and gelatinous textured accompaniments.\n\n10) Es Campur (Mixed tropical fruits with shave ice, condensed milk, chocolate & raspberry syrup) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Shave ice - My favorite of the three desserts, the chocolate and raspberry flavors are unexpected.\n\nBeing my maiden voyage in Indonesian cuisine, the variety highlighted this roller coaster of a meal as many of the foods did not taste like they \"looked\".  My gracious host, being born in Indonesia, kindly gave me a taste of local authentic foods from his home country.  Unlike Cantonese cuisine where most local restaurants predominantly use soy sauce or oyster sauce, the flavor profile adds the sour and sweet elements and different textures in unexpected ways.

My family is Chinese-Indonesian, so I wanted to invite my boyfriend and two friends to try a new cuisine. I was recommended to go to Borobudur by my mom, so we knew we had to try it. \n\nWe ordered the following: gado-gado, martabak sapi, lumpia semarang, sate kombinasi, rendang, bakmi goreng with shrimp, and nasi uduk. All were very good and authentic. I was disappointed they didn't have nasi kuning (yellow rice), but I'll live. I also forgot to order the ayam goreng (fried chicken) which is the best thing ever, but we all had enough to eat. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered, pisang goreng with ice cream and and es campur. Both, again, were authentic and very good. I did want to have pisang bakar keju, but the idea of grilled banana and cheese didn't seem to sit well with my party. But I promise you, it's good! \n\nA great place for Indonesian food. Although service is slow, you have to take it for what it is--that's the culture, so you can't really blame them. No SF health tax (a plus!). Total with 4 people and tip is about $100. GREAT DEAL!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-12"}, {"excerpts": ["It's call Es Campur and is similar to Philipino halo halo or the Vietnamese desserts with red bean and coconut milk.\n\n"], "author": "Jennifer H.", "review": "Is it obnoxious that I'm Asian, but this was the first time I had Indonesian food?  Let's just say I'm totally hooked.  It was truly delicious.\n\n-Roti Prata the layers, ah the layers.  Dipping sauce was mmhh mmh good.\n\n-Udang Bakar Kecap were grilled marinated tiger prawn in smooth honey sauce.   Doesn't sound unique, but it's nothing like I've ever tasted before.  Simple, but done well.\n\n-Rendang is sumatra beef stew cooked with spices in coconut milk sauce.  O M G ...  OMG  ... O M G  this was super GOOD.  I loved this dish.  If  you're a beef stew type of person like me, this is a must.\n\n-Tumis Bayam Terasi Pedas  is sauteed spinach with tofu, tomato, & spicy shrimp paste.  This was also very good.  Cooked very well.  Flavors everywhere.  If you don't like asian fish sauce or shrimp paste, you may not like this though.\n \nDessert was KICK BUTT too!!!  Mixed tropical fruits with shave ice, condensed milk, chocolate & raspberry syrup.  It's call Es Campur and is similar to Philipino halo halo or the Vietnamese desserts with red bean and coconut milk.\n\nI would return again and again.  Surprisingly crowded for a weekday night, but you won't have to wait for a table.  Don't let the non-Indonesian crowd fool you.  Food was great and one of the peeps in our group used to go with a girl from Indonesia and he said this place is super authentic.
