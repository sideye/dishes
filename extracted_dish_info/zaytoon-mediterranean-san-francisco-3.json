I gasped when the guy said, \"Seven-dollars, please\" (no prices listed on the menu). I gasped again when no foodgasm ensued. Kinda like being with a minute man. Ladies, you know what's up...or not.\n \nYesterday, I was reading about a new Mexican restaurant in Russian Hill opening today where A [single] taco with no crema, no guacamole, and no sides is $12. With tax, healthy sf tax, and tip that's $16 for ONE taco. Ridiculous. \n \nMy point is, food prices are insane in San Francisco so I love it when I can get a satisfying meal for around $10 or less.   \n \nI was on my way to an appointment and stopped by Zaytoon for a quick lunch. There's only several stools for seating and a public parklet outside so it's more of a to-go spot. Street parking is only doable during the weekdays around the mornings or lunch. \n \nZaytoon's menu is straight forward with salads, wraps, burgers, and platters. Protein choices: Falafel, lamb, chicken and beef kebab. Everything is under $10.95. Gluten-free option is +$2. The meats are sources from Niman Ranch and breads are locally sourced. Cc's accepted. \n \nI ordered the Lamb Shawarma Wrap ($10.95) to go.

The Niman Ranch lamb was robust with spices, and the sumac seasoned onions with sweet broiled tomatoes created a wrap that was jam packed with layers of flavor. I requested it \"spicy\" and the hot sauce had a good, lingering heat (medium spicy). The wrap was tightly wrapped so there was no leaks. I saved the other half for dinner and it kept well with zero sogginess. Minor gripe: I wish the lavash was toasted more. \n\nPrevious picture(s) of the wraps looked skimpy - Ed U's lamb shawarma from 2010: http://bit.ly/2crk4Zi.

With tax, healthy sf tax, and tip that's $16 for ONE taco. Ridiculous. \n \nMy point is, food prices are insane in San Francisco so I love it when I can get a satisfying meal for around $10 or less.   \n \nI was on my way to an appointment and stopped by Zaytoon for a quick lunch. There's only several stools for seating and a public parklet outside so it's more of a to-go spot. Street parking is only doable during the weekdays around the mornings or lunch. \n \nZaytoon's menu is straight forward with salads, wraps, burgers, and platters. Protein choices: Falafel, lamb, chicken and beef kebab. Everything is under $10.95. Gluten-free option is +$2. The meats are sources from Niman Ranch and breads are locally sourced. Cc's accepted. \n \nI ordered the Lamb Shawarma Wrap ($10.95) to go. Don't forget to check-on Yelp for 10% off.\n \nWhile waiting for my wrap to be prepared, the Steve Harvey Show was showing on their tv. The topic: \"The 30-Day Sex Challenge\" where couples do the horizontal mambo every day for 30-days. Normally, I wouldn't be able to peel my eyes away from the screen but one of the ladies on the show looked like my mom. So...I stared at the empty parklet outside instead.  \n\nLuckily, my wrap was ready to go in less than 5 minutes. \n\nWhen I unraveled the foil, I was pleasantly surprised to see my wrap generously STUFFED with lamb: http://bit.ly/2cVnaaR. The Niman Ranch lamb was robust with spices, and the sumac seasoned onions with sweet broiled tomatoes created a wrap that was jam packed with layers of flavor. I requested it \"spicy\" and the hot sauce had a good, lingering heat (medium spicy). The wrap was tightly wrapped so there was no leaks. I saved the other half for dinner and it kept well with zero sogginess. Minor gripe: I wish the lavash was toasted more. \n\nPrevious picture(s) of the wraps looked skimpy - Ed U's lamb shawarma from 2010: http://bit.ly/2crk4Zi. I'm glad they have since beefed up their fillings and I hope it stays that way. \n\n4.5 STARS rounded up in hopes that their skimpy shawarma was of yesteryear and thick, g-i-r-t-h-y wraps are here to stay!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-09-14"}, {"excerpts": ["It's never very busy, at least in my experience, but that just means more falafel wraps for me! \n", "Which brings me to my next point: their falafel is pretty tasty - not too dry or bland like some places.

The sandwich was juicy and the taste was phenomenal. Think I'm exaggerating? Try it yourself. \n\nLamb shawerma. The quality of lamb is top notch. They use Niman Ranch meat, the best quality meats around. Like the chicken, the lamb is juicy, tender, and delicious. That with all the dressings that the chef puts on makes for a great meal that will leave you satisfied for hours. \n\nFalafel. So good. Fresh, fresh fresh. The tahini sauce is great. I usually don't like it but I eat it here. I don't know how else to describe it. Tasty and fresh. \n\nCustomer service. One of the guys behind the counter all the time, his name is Chris, is a very very nice guy.

I guess the only thing missing is ample seating space, but to me that's no big issue.\n\nI came here on a Friday night about half an hour before they closed, and the employees were all super friendly and didn't make us feel bad about going so late. It is a typical fast casual restaurant in that you order and pay upfront at the counter, so I guess that helped a bit. The nice cashier was even friendly enough to clear our plates for us, as we were their last customers of the night. She was very great and I loved how friendly and helpful she was despite the late hour.\n\nThe food itself was also amazing. The meats (both the kebab and the chicken) were incredibly tender and juicy, while the salads, hummus, and pita were as perfect as could be. We were both especially impressed by how the pita struck a perfect balance of fluffiness and crunchiness - not an easy task. I also appreciated how my kebab plate came with some blocks of feta cheese, which was just a small touch that made an excellent flavor pairing with the pickled onions and garlic sauce.\n\nOverall, if I had the choice I would definitely pick this place over Souvla any day.

The place is pretty small with just a few bar-counter-esque seats and a cute little parklet outside. I was happy to note from the menu that the prices are very fair - nothing is more than $10.95! I ordered the chicken platter ($9.45) while my friend got the Kebab Platter ($9.95) and asked the staff to sear my chicken a bit more, which they were happy to do!\n\nOpening the to-go box for the chicken platter, my first thought was whoa this is a solid-sized portion. It came with a good amount of shawarma-style chicken, 4 pita halves, and a cucumber tomato salad. My only wish is that they gave more tzatziki sauce than just the tiny container I found inside, given that you need some sauce to accompany the chicken and that hummus costs extra. The chicken itself had excellent flavor and was well-marinated / cooked. The pita didn't taste super authentic, but I don't mind much. \n\nWhen we opened the kebab platter box, our reaction was a bit different. It had the same sides (pita, salad, grilled tomato which I had skipped on) but there were only two small kebabs. It was definitely a much much smaller portion of meat even though it cost slightly more. So my tip would be to avoid the kebab platter and stick to the chicken or lamb platters to get more bang for your buck. Similarly here, we felt the tiny container of tahini sauce could have been a bit larger - its things like this that will go a long way and elevate Zaytoon to a 4/5-star rating. Like the chicken, the kebabs also had great flavor and were quite juicy so we enjoyed them.\n\nOverall, I liked Zaytoon given the prices and high quality meat.

The place is pretty small with just a few bar-counter-esque seats and a cute little parklet outside. I was happy to note from the menu that the prices are very fair - nothing is more than $10.95! I ordered the chicken platter ($9.45) while my friend got the Kebab Platter ($9.95) and asked the staff to sear my chicken a bit more, which they were happy to do!\n\nOpening the to-go box for the chicken platter, my first thought was whoa this is a solid-sized portion. It came with a good amount of shawarma-style chicken, 4 pita halves, and a cucumber tomato salad. My only wish is that they gave more tzatziki sauce than just the tiny container I found inside, given that you need some sauce to accompany the chicken and that hummus costs extra. The chicken itself had excellent flavor and was well-marinated / cooked. The pita didn't taste super authentic, but I don't mind much. \n\nWhen we opened the kebab platter box, our reaction was a bit different. It had the same sides (pita, salad, grilled tomato which I had skipped on) but there were only two small kebabs. It was definitely a much much smaller portion of meat even though it cost slightly more. So my tip would be to avoid the kebab platter and stick to the chicken or lamb platters to get more bang for your buck. Similarly here, we felt the tiny container of tahini sauce could have been a bit larger - its things like this that will go a long way and elevate Zaytoon to a 4/5-star rating.

The Niman Ranch lamb was robust with spices, and the sumac seasoned onions with sweet broiled tomatoes created a wrap that was jam packed with layers of flavor. I requested it \"spicy\" and the hot sauce had a good, lingering heat (medium spicy). The wrap was tightly wrapped so there was no leaks.

Pretty basic, and they don't have any corn/clam combo pies on offer, but what they do have is tasty. I got a falafel hand-pie and absolutely devoured it. The veggies are fresh, the falafel not too greasy, and the hummus not insanely garlicky (hate that). The sizes are pretty good too, which is necessary when you're paying $7 for a fucking falafel hand-pie.\n\nThey have a nice little section offering pre-made hummus and other goodies as well if you're into that sort of thing. Service is fast, friendly, and they take cards, which is great because the last thing I want to do when I'm craving an Arabic hand-pie is walk all the way from 22nd and Guerrero to Mission and 23rd to take out cash at BOFA. And don't tell me to use the ATM across the street at Pride Suprette (ROFL!) because it charges you like $4 fucking dollars and that just isn't coo.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan, and I'm glad a spot offering a new spin on the traditional hand-pie is right around the corner.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-07-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Zaytoon is a great solution when you are starving and want something filling and fast but still relatively healthy.

It's taste brings back memories of my mother's cooking when I was a kid. \n\nFirst, chicken shawerma. Chicken is soft, juicy, and tender. The combination of chicken and shatta (hot sauce) is like a match made in heaven. Don't worry, for those of you who don't like spicy Zaytoon caters to you too. The sandwich was juicy and the taste was phenomenal. Think I'm exaggerating? Try it yourself. \n\nLamb shawerma. The quality of lamb is top notch. They use Niman Ranch meat, the best quality meats around. Like the chicken, the lamb is juicy, tender, and delicious. That with all the dressings that the chef puts on makes for a great meal that will leave you satisfied for hours. \n\nFalafel. So good. Fresh, fresh fresh. The tahini sauce is great. I usually don't like it but I eat it here. I don't know how else to describe it. Tasty and fresh. \n\nCustomer service. One of the guys behind the counter all the time, his name is Chris, is a very very nice guy. If you aren't sure what you would like because its your first time he will describe the different items and suggest something that would fit your liking. He is friendly, nice, and very efficient. The other people that work are also very nice, but most of my countless trips to Zaytoon have been with Chris behind the register. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend it. Try the other restaurants in the area if you'd like, but this is where the quality is.

"], "author": "Kimberly C.", "review": "I was skeptical of another middle eastern wrap place, but Zaytoon is a solid addition to the 'hood. \nBright, clean atmosphere, fast and convenient. I had the mazza platter, which hit the spot: \nGreat falafel -- it was fresh and warm, good and crispy on the outside but still light and flavorful on the inside.\nTabbouleh and dolma -- these are the real wins. Tabbouleh is often mushy and old, or overly lemony. This is fresh and zingy without being overbearing. The dolma are as good as Haig's, which are my favorite! \nThe platter also includes a yummy selection of olives and chunks of good quality feta. \nThe babbaganoush is deliciously roasty-flavored. \nTwo things I look forward to?
