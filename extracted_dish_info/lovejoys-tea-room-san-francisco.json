Very tasty and pretty filling. Nice as a sharing platter. \n\nSavory tea ($14.95) - 2 sandwhich options w/ choice of tea. Had the smoked salmon with cream cheese, which was a bit much for me.

A bit pricey for the amount of fruits served.\n\nTea choices:\n\nDarjeeling - A good complement with the food. Not a too heavy tea.

It's strange because I don't think Lovejoy's is superior to its competitors in any of the areas I judge a British tea room on, and usually that has to be the case to warrant 5 stars from me. However, sometimes things are greater than the sum of their parts and my overall experience at Lovejoy's was five-star.\n\nDecor and Ambience: Like many British tea rooms, Lovejoy's is dotted throughout with fancy, antique teaware. The quaint setting is accented with old photos and Christmas lights. There's ample seating, although reservations are a must and the seating can accomodate parties large and small. Expect a pleasant buzz of chatter at all hours of operation\n\nTeaware: The saucers, cups and strainers have lovely Victorian designs with Mid-Century modern materials. The tea trays were a little disappointing--dull and metal\n\nTea selection: Lovejoy's offers some unique options like vanilla rooibos along with classics like English Breakfast. I didn't find the former very good, but I'd definitely recommend the \"house\" tea, the Tea Room Blend. Overall, I think the menu offers a good selection of British/Western favorites, but those hoping for good Asian options might be disappointed\n\nFood: I found the prices a little high, considering the portion size, but the quality is definitely above average. I got the \"Me Tea\". The smoked salmon and cream cheese tea sandwich came on fluffy white bread and the salmon was moist and delicious. The scone was a little dry, but the accompanying Devonshire cream was plentiful and rich. I saw that Lovejoy's offered pasties and I just had to order a beef one. When I lived in London, I had the most delicious beef pasties and it's been extremely hard for me to find good ones in the US.

I also tried two petit fours: the strawberry shortcake and the raspberry Victorian wedding cake. We were told the insides were marzipan (which I'm not really a fan of), but they were more like cake. Both were very sweet and delicious, but I think I preferred the strawberry shortcake\n\nService: Fantastic. Friendly, warm, attentive and efficient. All servers knew their menus inside and out, and were clearly passionate about afternoon tea\n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful afternoon chatting with my two Boston girlfriends who had just moved to San Francisco.

There is no skimping on that sandwich menu, believe me.  They serve Taylor's tea, among other choices, so that's pretty cool....but it'd be even cooler if they carried Sainsbury's Red Label!\n\nAnd then there's the scones.  And the chestnut tea.

"], "author": "Miriam W.", "review": "OK, I'm going to split this into a two-pronged attack!\n\n1) TEA WHORES\n\nIf you are a true tea connoisseur and lover and you have at least 5 loose-leaf teas at home in proper temperature controlled and vacuum-sealed containers that did not come to you as a gift in a gift basket, you are a true tea lover. Being a generic tea lover, however, is separate from being a Western-tradition high tea lover, in that, there's East and West. Dimsum-style East, high tea-style West. If you have participated and explored the tea rituals of the west frequently -- you will not see this as five-star place, but you will enjoy it. \n\n2) GENERAL PUBLIC\n\nIt is quaint, it is charming like all the reviews say. The teas are good. Not amazing, but good. The service is ... good enough. It's San Francisco, the place isn't huge. The prices ... are as expected. The ambiance is your dotty grandma's house, stuffed to the gills with tea paraphernalia and family photos, doilies and crochet-work cuddling up the dusty old lampshades. The bathroom is clean and spacious (a rarity in the city). It is filled with many groups of women at various stages of life, from celebrating engagements to graduations to gossiping to catch up. The petit fours are freshly made and moist (I was surprised and impressed by this). The scones are freshly made, as they should be. They do provide proper clotted / Devonshire cream, and luxurious preserves to smear on your scone. They have a good-sized savoury menu aside from tea service.\n\nIf you're not a tea whore and don't really take your high tea very seriously, and you rarely do this sort of thing, you'll be satisfied with the environment and you will have fun, and one tea service will generally make you stuffed and happy.\n\nIf you ARE a tea whore, you will notice some thangs. They aren't major, but cost the fifth star:\n\n- Service: This place has been around a while and is extremely busy and popular, and it's in the city, so I get the \"French maitre'd\" vibe that has happened. Let's just say that the vibe I expect when I go to High Tea is generally about ensuring you are calm, comfortable, looked after, and delighted. We had touch points with multiple staff members and only one staff member was happy and pleasant toward us; the rest treated us like they were busy lor annoyed and that worrying about how busy they were was more important than worrying about the experience for the customers they had. They basically expect that making the food, putting the tea in front of you, the decor, and checking on you once suffices. It does not. I highly recommend that if it's possible all the staff members attend a proper tea (I have yet to find one in SF actually, even at highly rated hotels) and once they have their mind blown they'll get it. It's hard to explain. It's about the experience, the ritual, and being catered to, tea time is sacred in England. Originally, it went on for hours. If you are really trying to recreate that experience, you're not there yet. If you're making your own Cali version ... it's good enough.\n\n- Pricing: A quality tea service doesn't charge you extra for a \"bottomless pot of tea.\" It's included in the price of the service. Also it's SF, so I wasn't surprised by how much you pay for what you get, but it's a little on the stingy side (I was letting it go for the foodstuffs but I got offended that you're paying extra for the tea, since that's the whole point of being there).\n\n- Food: For 3 people, they don't give you particularly generous portions of clotted cream or preserves. We are all trying to watch our weight so we didn't ask for more and made do. Salad is generous. The caraway seed (I think that's the spice) is FAR too overused in their coleslaw salad and I'd frankly they not include that salad and expend that on a free petit four for everybody by default. Quiche looked good; we didn't get to try the crumpets. Scones were good. Sandwiches were on the small side so if you order a tea service with 2 included per person I recommend you order one more for the table to share. Cream cheese is nothing special / has nothing in it (no herbs or seasoning) but the salmon tasted fresh. Basically the sandwiches are super simple and more like tea at home that auntie made versus tea at a fine tea house. Tomato and cheese is straight up tomato and cheese - you could make it at home.\n\n- Tea: As mentioned, good, not amazing. If they spent money on real high quality tea they'd be broke of course, or prices would have to go up significantly. They have a pretty broad selection. I just went with the House Blend, which was okay. Friends ordered other types and were pleased with theirs. The staff made note of how long we should steep the tea, which was great to see.\n\nIf you ever want to have a tea experience that blows your mind -- Brown Hotel in London.

A sign reading \"Reserved for the Queens\" was sitting on the table when we arrived. *Does the Queen of England Wave.*\n\nTheir menu features ala carte items (including pasties ($9.95), shepherd's pie ($10.95), and quiche ($10.95)) and an assortment of combinations, ranging from the \"Cream Tea\" ($14.95) which comes with scones, fruit, and a bottomless pot o' tea to the \"Queen's Tea\" ($26.95) which comes with two types of finger sandwiches, a coleslaw type salad, a green salad, scones, crumpets, fruit, petit fours, shortbread tea biscuits, and, of course, a bottomless pot o' tea.\n\nMy friends and I split 5 High Tea's ($19.95) among the 7 of us (see picture for the tower o' treats!). This came with 10 different types of finger sandwiches, 5 different pots of tea, a green salad, coleslaw, scones, and shortbread cookies. They have many different finger sandwiches to choose from. My favorites were the smoked salmon and cream cheese, the special chicken and pesto, and the pear and stilton (blue cheese). They also have an assortment of teas. We tried the vanilla lavender, a green tea, the spiced citrus, and the teahouse blend. Our favorite was the Vanilla Lavender so definitely try that one when you go :).\n\nThank you so much Lovejoy's for such an adorable, fun, and laidback way to spend my special day with friends!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-02-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We all ordered the Queen's Tea, sausage rolls & a quiche.

I don't eat beef, and there have been some times where I can't substitute items without changing my entire order.  I got the turkey with dijon mustard and artichoke hummus for my Queen's tea.  They were both very good.  The Queen's tea also came with a salad and coleslaw.  I wasn't a fan of the salad because it has arugula.  I'm not an fan of it, but it did go well with the coleslaw, which had the right amount of dressing.

After having my first official afternoon tea in London during our honeymoon, I was dying for another opportunity to enjoy such an experience. My husband is the greatest and made reservations at this spot. What a sport - he was the only guy in the joint and didn't complain, just let me enjoy my tea. \n\nI had the Me Tea - a bottomless pot (although I could only handle one pot) of brown rice and popcorn green tea, a scone with butter and jam, and a tomato and cheddar sandwich. The presentation was adorable although a bit more rustic than our fancy London experience. I love the character of all mismatched serve ware but was a little bummed about the cleanliness (a stained ring around the rim of my husband's tea cup prior to pouring tea, sediment buildup at the bottom of my tea pot) but it is fine. We are talking about tea in San Francisco, not a high end spot in London. My tea was delicious and the scone was probably one of the best I've had. \n\nMidway through, I started to get a mild allergic reaction (light swelling of my lips but nothing crazy). I have a nut allergy and didn't think to mention it before ordering since what I ordered should have been nut free - totally my fault and not at all theirs - but when I asked if anything had nuts, the server quickly responded \"no\" and carried on. I popped a benedryl and continued on enjoying my tea. It would have been nice to know so that I can let you guys know and be aware for myself next time that maybe the butter had ground walnuts (sounds crazy but I've experienced this elsewhere before), or the scones were made with almond flour, but got no such explanation. If you have an allergy, I would be sure to ask first and clearly state so if you have a severe allergy but also be prepared just in case. \n\nThe worst part, the thing that warrants a 3-star review, was the service in my opinion. It felt VERY rushed even though they weren't busy. We had reservations and were immediately seated - awesome. We ordered shortly thereafter and our food arrived within a few minutes - okay great. But then, as I was finishing my food and sipping my tea, the check arrived. I didn't even have time to order another pot if I wanted to, it just felt so rushed. We still sat there for another 10 minutes after paying because I wanted to finish the pot I was currently on (afterall, at $10 a pot, you should be able to enjoy more than a cup or two). I think we were there for a total of 40 minutes. That combined with the nonchalance of the allergy mention above made me a little bummed about the customer service.\n\nNonetheless it is a cute place and I'd hope you'd have a better experience than we did. I'd say we'd give it another shot, but there are other tea places that I will likely want to try instead to get an experience worthy of the price tag that comes with an afternoon tea.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-11-19"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered cream tea, which came with two scones, about a scant tablespoon of clotted cream, a little bit of jam, and some fresh fruit.

We walked in on a weekday afternoon and were immediately seated. It wasn't busy at all. As everyone says it's quite another matter on weekends. The service was perfectly fine. The food and the tea were sub-par.\n\nI feel I must explain what Cream Tea is before I review what I was served.  A cream tea doesn't mean tea which is creamy. A cream tea is a scone served with clotted cream, optionally (though usually) also jam, and a pot of tea. It is a kind of set piece. Clotted cream is a kind of delicious creamy thing about halfway between the most delicate butter you've ever had and whipped cream. It is, not too put too fine a point on it, the very heart of cream tea. You want a generous amount of it. I know all this from having had a great deal of cream tea in England in a variety of tea places. \n\nI ordered cream tea, which came with two scones, about a scant tablespoon of clotted cream, a little bit of jam, and some fresh fruit. A tablespoon of clotted cream is not enough for one scone, never mind for two. There should have been at least three times that much clotted cream. I am not exaggerating or being facetious. You want to be able to spread a thick amount of clotted cream and then have enough left to lick out of the container like a barbarian, if you can get away with it. I understand that they are importing clotted cream in tiny jars from the UK at great expense, but considering how much the whole cream tea costs, I think they could afford to be more generous with the stuff. It's also possible to make your own clotted cream from scratch, and the only problem is you have to make rather a lot of it at once which shouldn't be such an issue for a shop that specializes in tea. \n\nInexplicably, the scones were heated up. I realize it says that on the menu and perhaps I ought not to have been surprised. But I was surprised because scones should not be warmed up. They should be fresh, but not warm and certainly not re-warmed. Rewarming scones is just not done. I don't know how else to put that. It's incorrect. Aside from it being not done, it's also a bad idea because it will melt your delicious clotted cream and ruin its texture and coolness. It also can't be good for the texture of the scones. \n\nThese were raisin scones, which in my experience are sometimes a bit more solid rather than crumbly, and maybe if they had not been re-heated they would have been on the far end of the acceptable range of scone textures. They were not the right texture. They utterly lacked any crumbliness. Sure, if you're used to Starbucks scones, you might be impressed. But if you are expecting an English style scone, these are not that. They are incorrect.\n\nThe jam was fine, though still a little bit less than I would really expect.\n\nTo summarize, there was not enough clotted cream and the scones were wrong.\n\nNow let us move on to the tea. I ordered the house blend black tea, and it was a very good full-bodied tea. Milk was provided, as it should be. It was loose-leaf and came in a teapot. You had to strain it with a little strainer when pouring because the leaves are put directly in the teapot. Which is OK and I can't say it's not correct, lots of English people do it that way.\n\nThe tea was good for the first cup. Because there was no way to take out the tea leaves, it inevitably became over-brewed for subsequent cups. When I got very close to the bottom of the teapot, the waitress came by to \"warm up\" the pot to make good on the promise of bottomless tea. I can't be 100% sure about what happened next. Based on the flavor of the tea it seems like the old tea leaves were not replaced and either more hot water was added or more hot water with some more leaves. Anyway it was bitter and not very good a that point. The whole tea part of the experience could be improved by putting the looseleaf tea in a brewing basket (which is not heretical in any way and lots of English tea houses do it, and it's not like authenticity appears to be a concern at this teahouse). \n\nEverything that went wrong could be fixed with a little bit of effort and care. That's part of why I'm writing this review. I'd love for nothing more than to be able to pay slightly too much money for a very good cream tea without flying all the way to England.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure lots of people will continue to have a nice time playing dress-up and doing England cosplay at this highly atmospheric cute little joint.

No recognition at all that something has changed in their service or that there's something amiss. \n\nShe then tells me that we are supposed to flag down the server if we want more hot water for our tea. Since when? Like many of you I have been to tea rooms in many places, in many places, including England. And nowhere does the customer have to flag the server down for hot water. It is their job to come by and do a refill.\n\nThe Correct attitude of the new owner would be to say, yes I understand that we haven't done enough, our service has not been up to standards. The fact is, since the new ownership, the service has actually been fine. Why it was different this time I don't know. I have been here before Christmas with the new owners, so it can't be that. It's the attitude that I don't appreciate. After years of enjoying this place under the former owners tutelage, this new situation is sad.\n\nFood: They seem to have gotten the food right now with Sandwiches, scones, and salads. They seem to have ironed out the kinks in the food since they took over from the original owner. I'm sad to say that the service is driving me and others away from this business.\n\nEarlier--\nSeptember 2016: \nScones much improved. Perhaps it's an entirely different purveyor that they are acquiring them from? Service good as always. \nThe main problem: the scented products in the bathroom. The first of our party to go in there came back and warned us. I went and asked someone about it for going in. Finally I had to talk to the owner and she removed the products. Honestly, it's a tiny space and I have a medical issue. But even my friend-- she couldn't breathe, her head aching afterwards. I could see having the usual scented soap in there has a lingering effect, but please consider people who can't abide by scented products let alone blasting it in a small space. \n\nAugust 2016:\nNew owners have taken charge. No more Muna! Please give them feedback so that they can maintain this wonderful business. \nAlong with the two scones which were undercooked, we received the usual raspberry jam, watery whipping cream which did not barely fill the thimble size container, and no lemon curd. They have added a few sandwiches to the menu, which is fine. I would not make any more changes at the moment, and instead concentrate on maintaining quality. Service was good as usual, attentive, lovely, personable. Sandwiches were good.

I live a few blocks from here and after begging A for MONTHS to go on a tea date with me, he finally gave in and we were able to make a reservation. I will say that I think we may have gotten in earlier had we been able to walk in but Lovejoy's is too popular. I think the reservation process is a bit opaque, however, since you have to request a reservation without knowing which times are available. I wish they were on OpenTable or Resy or at least had a more detailed calendar but I guess there is some charm in having to go through a bit of effort.\n\nAnyways, we requested any available time but noted that we preferred earlier in the day on Saturday rather than later. To our luck, we got a reservation at 11AM right when they opened. When we got there, the place was already pretty full and there was a wedding shower going on at one of the long communal tables. Lovejoy's is SUPER cute on the inside and they have all of these adorable hats you can wear during your tea party. A was not about that AT ALL and felt a bit self-conscious in the admittedly feminine space.\n\nAnyways, we had a difficult time ordering because we didn't want to over-order. We settled on getting one Queen's Tea ($28) and split the bottomless tea pot (+$2) since we both wanted a black tea and it didn't make sense to spend an additional $10 when we would have ordered something similar if not the same thing. We also split the Tea Sandwich Plate ($12.95). The 4 tea sandwich choices we chose between the Queen's Tea and the Plate were the Roast Beef & Horseradish, Chicken-Apple-Walnut Salad, Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese and the Pear and Stilton. We liked them all with the exception of the Pear and Stilton which had a weird taste. Both sandwich plates also came with a mixed green salad and cabbage slaw both of which were okay if not standard. The Queen's Tea also came with a scone, a crumpet and a petit four. The scones at Lovejoy's are AMAZING. It was served warm and was flaky but not dry. We devoured the one that came with our tea so we ordered another one for $2.95 and did not regret it at all. The crumpet was satisfying and the petit four was cute and the perfect end to our meal.

"], "author": "Miriam W.", "review": "OK, I'm going to split this into a two-pronged attack!\n\n1) TEA WHORES\n\nIf you are a true tea connoisseur and lover and you have at least 5 loose-leaf teas at home in proper temperature controlled and vacuum-sealed containers that did not come to you as a gift in a gift basket, you are a true tea lover. Being a generic tea lover, however, is separate from being a Western-tradition high tea lover, in that, there's East and West. Dimsum-style East, high tea-style West. If you have participated and explored the tea rituals of the west frequently -- you will not see this as five-star place, but you will enjoy it. \n\n2) GENERAL PUBLIC\n\nIt is quaint, it is charming like all the reviews say. The teas are good. Not amazing, but good. The service is ... good enough. It's San Francisco, the place isn't huge. The prices ... are as expected. The ambiance is your dotty grandma's house, stuffed to the gills with tea paraphernalia and family photos, doilies and crochet-work cuddling up the dusty old lampshades. The bathroom is clean and spacious (a rarity in the city). It is filled with many groups of women at various stages of life, from celebrating engagements to graduations to gossiping to catch up. The petit fours are freshly made and moist (I was surprised and impressed by this). The scones are freshly made, as they should be. They do provide proper clotted / Devonshire cream, and luxurious preserves to smear on your scone. They have a good-sized savoury menu aside from tea service.\n\nIf you're not a tea whore and don't really take your high tea very seriously, and you rarely do this sort of thing, you'll be satisfied with the environment and you will have fun, and one tea service will generally make you stuffed and happy.\n\nIf you ARE a tea whore, you will notice some thangs. They aren't major, but cost the fifth star:\n\n- Service: This place has been around a while and is extremely busy and popular, and it's in the city, so I get the \"French maitre'd\" vibe that has happened. Let's just say that the vibe I expect when I go to High Tea is generally about ensuring you are calm, comfortable, looked after, and delighted. We had touch points with multiple staff members and only one staff member was happy and pleasant toward us; the rest treated us like they were busy lor annoyed and that worrying about how busy they were was more important than worrying about the experience for the customers they had. They basically expect that making the food, putting the tea in front of you, the decor, and checking on you once suffices. It does not. I highly recommend that if it's possible all the staff members attend a proper tea (I have yet to find one in SF actually, even at highly rated hotels) and once they have their mind blown they'll get it. It's hard to explain. It's about the experience, the ritual, and being catered to, tea time is sacred in England. Originally, it went on for hours. If you are really trying to recreate that experience, you're not there yet. If you're making your own Cali version ... it's good enough.\n\n- Pricing: A quality tea service doesn't charge you extra for a \"bottomless pot of tea.\" It's included in the price of the service. Also it's SF, so I wasn't surprised by how much you pay for what you get, but it's a little on the stingy side (I was letting it go for the foodstuffs but I got offended that you're paying extra for the tea, since that's the whole point of being there).\n\n- Food: For 3 people, they don't give you particularly generous portions of clotted cream or preserves. We are all trying to watch our weight so we didn't ask for more and made do. Salad is generous. The caraway seed (I think that's the spice) is FAR too overused in their coleslaw salad and I'd frankly they not include that salad and expend that on a free petit four for everybody by default. Quiche looked good; we didn't get to try the crumpets. Scones were good. Sandwiches were on the small side so if you order a tea service with 2 included per person I recommend you order one more for the table to share. Cream cheese is nothing special / has nothing in it (no herbs or seasoning) but the salmon tasted fresh. Basically the sandwiches are super simple and more like tea at home that auntie made versus tea at a fine tea house. Tomato and cheese is straight up tomato and cheese - you could make it at home.\n\n- Tea: As mentioned, good, not amazing. If they spent money on real high quality tea they'd be broke of course, or prices would have to go up significantly. They have a pretty broad selection. I just went with the House Blend, which was okay. Friends ordered other types and were pleased with theirs. The staff made note of how long we should steep the tea, which was great to see.\n\nIf you ever want to have a tea experience that blows your mind -- Brown Hotel in London.

The intense blue cheese paired incredibly well with the sweet pear.\n\nEverything else was quote bland and \"safe\":\nMediocre: Daily Special (roast beef & mustard), Chicken Apple Walnut Salad (though \nToo plain for me: Cucumber & Cream Cheese, Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese, Salmon Mousse\n\n* Organic Spring Greens, Cabbage Salad in a Caraway Cream Dressing - 3 stars\nPretty simple, the only accent flavor being little mandarin orange slices, and there wasn't quite enough of that. The dressing seemed like a balsamic vinaigrette and the sharpness of that complemented the greens and the orange pretty well. I did wish the salad was colder; it seemed room temp, even warm later on.\n\n* Fresh Fruit - 3 stars\nPretty, but not much beyond that. The winter melon was not ripe and a bit hard. Strawberries, blackberries, and kiwi were nice. \n\n* Petit Four - 4 stars\nfull platter: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#JSpHOzIStSs32UFby1oYIw\ncross-section of our choices: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#k3_KeW_0tv5f41UvRFRtJw\nWe got a dark chocolate/lemon, as well as a rosewater. The chocolate one wasn't great, the jelly-like lemon filling not as sharp as I'd hoped. The rose-water soaked bread-like filling of the other one was great, and we all liked that one much more.\n\n* Tea Biscuit - 3 stars\nNot much here, like those generic hard, buttery Italian cookies. \n\n* Crumpet with Lemon Curd - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#Fj33P7RuOhTOwxyb5OtVJQ\nLIke an English Muffin, but a little more dense, not so airy/fluffy. The outside is a little more crisped as well. Great with combinations of the lemon curd, butter, and blackberry preserves!\n\n* Warm Scone with Preserves & Devon Cream - 3.5 stars\nNot quite warm.

The ambiance at Lovejoy's is just lovely and inviting-it's no surprise that reservations are hard to come by so I feel quite lucky to have this tea service as soon as I walk in today. \n\nAs for the tea, the Royal Blend is pleasantly smooth, with a hint of orange and vanilla-but I may want to try other tea options on our next visit. There is quite a selection on their tea, tea sammies, and the petit fours. For our tea service this afternoon, we opt for the bay shrimp and mayonnaise, and turkey and dijon mustard-what dainty little tasty sandwiches these are... The scone, lemon curd, clotted cream and the raspberry jam were also nice and adequate. \n\nOverall, for a tea service, I would grade Lovejoy's Ambiance and friendly and attentive service to be 5 stars, taste of food at 3.5. I find their pricing to be quite affordable and would likely try to come back if the gods of tea service would kindly bless me with another spontaneous seating again since reservations are so difficult to get.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-01-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Also, the scones were some of the best I've had!\n\n"], "author": "Joyce E.", "review": "I was seriously envisioning giving Lovejoy's Tea Room a glowing 5 star review because I love all the cutesy quirky decor, but my best friend and I got the serious runs after visiting this place! I made a reservation for 2 at 2pm on a Thursday afternoon and my best friend and I arrived 15 minutes before our reservation. We were seated right away, but I was a bit disappointed that we were sitting so close to the party next to us because we could hear every single detail of their conversation. We were going to ask if we could move, but the place was packed and we didn't want to seem like snobs!\n\nAs per the suggestion of the server, we ordered the High Tea for one and added an extra scone and 2 extra sandwiches with the Yorkshire Gold Tea. The sandwiches we chose were Smoked Turkey and Dijon Mustard, Bay Shrimp and Mayo, Chicken and Asparagus, and Lovejoy's Daily Special, which was probably a ham with some sort of mustard. My BFF and I looked at each other thinking \"this is just an appetizer\" because the portions were very tiny. Yes, I do understand that tea is supposed to be light, but seriously, the portions were way to small! The Yorkshire Gold Tea was fantastic and definitely enough to share between 2 people. Also, the scones were some of the best I've had!\n\nAs we were eating and chatting about life, I noticed that I felt a tad bit hot halfway through. Thinking it was the tea and lack of ventilation on our side, I ignored it and started to feel this way throughout the remaining portion of our tea time. We paid, left, and my stomach started making odd noises. I ignored it until an hour passed and my BFF and I ran to the shiny porcelain throne and girl, let me tell you, it definitely felt like we were reenacting the scene from White Chicks when Brittany or Tiffany Wilson was holding on for her life when she had the quiche. Definitely NOT  a pretty look!

I wish i could have it daily. THe clotted cream and jam is the best touch to it. We were also given an awesome selection of sandwiches with the crusts cut off - tomato cheddar, smoked salmon, cucumber, asparagus and turkey, pesto and procutto - really great selection with different flavors. There were also a couple of side salads which were a nice addition. Very happy with it. There were also little tea biscuits on top of our tower.

Afternoon Darjeeling tastes like assam tea and oolong tea mixed together, but it is a thin-bodied, hence the smooth sailing down the piehole... It tastes like a vacation!

Your will arrive at your table \"reserved for rotalty\" with a pretty plate of hot crumpets and butter during the middle of your meal. This is when you drop whatever you have in your hand, pick up your butter knife, thereupon smearing your butter over your nice hot crumpet and enjoy while it's fresh and hot. Oh, believe me, it's worth getting enthusiastic about. It's like if Lana del Ray arrived at your door at night offering to sing you some lullabies. That exciting!!!! Notice she's my current and always and forever crush. Anyway, you can of course devour that wonderous duo of crumpet and butter alone or savor it with a bit of lemon curd or strawberry jam. You're royalty when you're here, so you can do as you well damn please ;) You will also get a petite four at the end of you're meal.

I live in SF, but they live in and around Washington, D.C.  I thought it would be much easier if I planned it, and I am SO HAPPY I found Lovejoy's on Yelp!  I knew nothing about tea parties and had actually never been to a tea before, but I liked the vibe and style of Lovejoy's: playful, mismatched cups and plates (I didn't know this was a \"thing\":), and very true to a British tea experience.  I would have been hesitant to do a tea like one that is done at a more expensive, stiffer place like the Ritz, for example. \nThis was right up my alley and everything from the communication to the planning, pricing, setup, event itself and returning the dishware went very smoothly.  \nCommunication:  When I inquired about a month prior to the shower (I was lucky they were available, I'd recommend planning sooner), Gillian followed up in a timely manner and gave me her email so we could more easily communicate specific items my mom and I wanted. We had several questions and Gillian answered each one thoughtfully and thoroughly.  When the date got closer, she had Nicola, the onsite staff who would set up our tea and food, contact us about logistics.  \nPlanning: It was slightly tricky because I was the main point of contact until my mom was able to join in on the email communication, and she wanted quite a bit more food than I thought we needed, and she had the foresight to ask more questions about dishware, setup, cleanup than I did!  That was fine and Gillian adjusted quotes as we went and had no problem with the multiple changes we made.\nPricing:  Everything was VERY reasonable, and  though I did not look into other places, I'd have a hard time imagining that other catered tea lunches providing the same level of service and quality of food and tea would be this inexpensive.

They usually have two walk-in tables for people without reservations so whoever gets to the door first before they open will get those tables...and possibly any tables where the reservation party didn't show up.  Since my group got there forty minutes before they opened, we were lucky to get the first walk-in table.\n\nSince it is a small room, the higher volume of ambient noise does make it difficult to talk and seating around your table could be a bit snug.  But after a few minutes, these small issues will pass through your conscious mind after pouring your first cup of tea and enjoying the first few bites of a tasty roast beef and horseradish sandwich.\n\nI definitely won't mind coming back to Lovejoy's because this English style tea house was my first introduction to the tea experience.  I can't imagine going to any other tea house unless they could surpass what Lovejoy's brings to the table...and I highly doubt that any locale in SF can do that.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Typically, each guest chooses a service which comes with a personal pot of tea (unlimited refills included) and a range of tea snacks from biscuits and scones to salad and sandwiches.

If your afternoon tea is also your lunch, I recommend the High Tea which comes with 2 sandwiches, salad, a scone, and a shortbread tea biscuit. My favorite sandwich selections are the cucumber & cream cheese (a tea time classic) and the chicken apple walnut salad. Since I gravitate toward floral tea flavors, I always order the China Rose Petal black tea and add some milk.\n\nFor those with a sweet tooth, the tray of petit fours can be irresistible if you still have room after your service. I have only tried the Victorian Wedding Cake which tasted very much like a standard vanilla cake pop but was a slightly bigger portion.\n\nThe lovely ladies who run the place are ever the gracious hosts--checking in for questions, constantly refilling tea pots, and never rushing the party.

I do prefer somewhere that has some finesse, while still keeping the Grandma and girly vibe like Lisa's Tea Treasures,  but this is more a matter of taste preference, so it didn't impact my rating. What did MATTER was the tables were cramped and quite close to each other, making it difficult to go to the bathroom. We could also hear a lot of different conversations. I would prefer more private tables with wider spacing, so I could just relax, but that's just not feasible in a small and popular place. I saw a bridal shower and I felt as if I would want a private room or alcove with less tables if I were them, which is offered in some tea places. The mismatched teapots/cups/strainers resulted in my friend getting a tea strainer that was not wide enough to place on her huge cup, so she had to do a switch-a-roo.\n\nService: The ladies offered to take a picture for us and were quite prolific in topping off our tea with more water.

The tanginess of the mayonnaise definitely enhanced the fresh taste of the shrimp and hid the oceany taste. \n\nSmoked Salmon and Cream Cheese. This was pretty good as well, just like my favorite lox and cream cheese sans bagel!\n\nChicken Apple Walnut Salad. My least favorite sandwich, mostly because I'm not really a fan of mushy salady sandwiches unless it's amazing and amazing this was not. It was just okay, nothing to write home about really. \n\n(Upper Level)\n\nScones with Strawberry Jam. These were alright, I think the scones at The Rotunda were better. These weren't buttery enough and were more dry. \n\nShortbread Cookies. Didn't taste these because my friend ended up bringing them home. \n\n(Not Shown)\n\nPetit Fours. Didn't actually try these unfortunately because we were THAT full. We couldn't stuff anymore in our stomachs!\n\nOverall, I thought it was a good amount of food for my money.

Their service was pretty good, they were very busy yet very attentive. \n\nFYI: My friend tried to make reservations the day before and they didn't have any left. So make your reservations early!

I'd stick with the Queen's tea platter.\n\nBottomless tea: we had the house blend (very strong and aromatic), mango decaf (didn't get to try), and Dragon Well green (lacked robustness, but probably because we didn't let it steep long enough).\n\nI'll definitely be back for more scones and tea.

The Queen's Tea comes with your choice of tea with unlimited refills, choice of 2 sandwiches, cole slaw, green salad, platter of fresh fruit, a scone with preserves and double devon cream, tea biscuit, crumpet with lemon curd and a petite four. The High Tea is just the same sans the fresh fruit, crumpet and petite four http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=9qzUBqc5axqMSGw-DIrsPQ. We opted for the Genmai Tea and Black Current Tea. For our sandwich selection, we had the smoked salmon and cream cheese, salmon mousse, mandarin orange and cream cheese, and bay shrimp and mayonnaise.\n\n[W] I thought the tea was pretty good here. I originally chose the Afternoon Darjeeling tea and saw the Genmai Tea written on a blackboard in the back of the restaurant. The hostess was nice enough to help me switch out the tea even though they made a point that they normally don't after they have brewed it. The Genmai http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=pOcaHOwOkJQRQSUJVsx19A was light and ricey. Kinda like the ones from Japanese and Korean restaurants. The sandwiches were pretty good. I especially liked the salmon and cream cheese sandwich as well as the mandarin orange and cream cheese was really refreshing. The crumpet http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=9KKmlGQB8rVk3Sc3ypRWOg looked like a sponge to me but was also good. The scones were really filling.\n\n[M] The Black Current black tea has a nice fruity aroma but doesn't taste as it smells. It was a bit strong and bitter and needed some water to tone down the flavor. My favorite tea selection at Lovejoy's is the China Rose Petal Black Tea and Strawberry Green Tea. The hostess recommended us the Chestnut tea. Perhaps we will try that next time. \n\n[W] Overall experience was nice.

Something about sitting around a wooden table with a lace tablecloth, or antique-style sofa with a few friends and a nice pot of tea really resonates within me. One would think I feel like a pretentious bourgeois snob, and I am not hypocritical enough to deny it; however, just let it be known that being San Franciscan automatically ingrained a bit of elitism in me. That being said, Lovejoy's Tea Room was not the first time I've taken afternoon tea, and it certainly won't be my last.\n\nWe came to Lovejoy's for my friend's birthday and hoped that we did not miss our stop while riding the J-line. The exterior did not impress me, but the moment we stepped inside, it was as if we were transported into another world. In contrast to the brightness and cuteness of Crown & Crumpet, Lovejoy's interior looked antique and mismatched and absolutely lovely. The cups and plates were all unique and pretty. Of the three tea rooms I've been to thus far, the interior design of Lovejoy's is my favorite by far. \n\nLuckily for us, it was a slow Friday afternoon and we were immediately seated, despite our lack of a reservation.

I got the smoked salmon with cream cheese, and Lovejoy's special, which was chicken and pesto. Both were unimpressive and was much too creamy. The Devon Cream made me feel as if I were eating butter. I've had better scones elsewhere. The strawberry preserves they gave us was definitely not homemade, and reminded me of smuckers (didn't even spring for Bonne Maman!), and the lemon curd was not tart enough.\n\nBut the tea was fantastic!

I made a reservation, and as soon as she landed, we took the J-church down here without incident, and the place was pretty easy to find.\n\nThey reserved us a seat on the couch, which was a cute place to sit (albeit a little bad for sitting up straight to eat), so that was nice of them. The menu is a little overwhelming with a bajillion choices, but I ended up ordering the Savory Tea, which included bottomless tea (I picked Vanilla Rooibos) and two sandwiches (I picked shrimp and mayo and smoked turkey and dijon mustard). My friend got the Cream Tea with Apricot Tea. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the sandwiches were tasty. I just didn't get very many of them, which, admittedly, is the point of tea.

So I walked into the back, and caught a glimpse of the kitchen where I saw a loaf of bread sitting on the counter. And that was when everything was shattered. It wasn't like, nice white bread. It was Safeway white bread. The kind you can pick up at any Safeway for about $2 a loaf. And then when I thought about it, it wasn't worth it. The sandwiches were good, but they weren't $15 for 8 small triangles good (including unlimited tea). I could have gone to Safeway and made my own delicious shrimp/mayo, turkey/mustard sandwiches. And the ambiance was good, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being made very well aware that I was out of place, that I didn't belong here. The servers were nice enough, but I felt like unless you were pretty acquainted with ordering tea, you would feel kind of uncomfortable ordering and asking questions.\n\nAnd after that, nothing was the same.

Parking is such a bother, but again, it's San Francisco.  I better mention now that the more horrid flaw regarding money (which I checked out just recently) is that each person must spend a little under $10 meaning that for example, if you're just by yourself, you can't just get a crumpet and milk and be good to go because you just spent $7.37 only before the tip.  Even if you add the tip, you're still under the minimum, as that's only $8.48.\n\nI need to get a couple of notes out of the way.

From the moment we walked in, every aspect of the tea service did not disappoint.  Considering there were 13 of us, the service was prompt and definitely on point and we never had to ask for a HOT pot of tea as they were constantly topping off our pots.  What a concept!\n\nSince that first experience, I've been here numerous times and I never get tired of it.  The mismatched furniture, dishes, tea cups and teapots... the lace and doilies... the variety of sandwiches... the salad... the coleslaw... the SCONES with double devon cream and jam... the shortbread cookies... and of course, the bottomless pots of hot tea.  Heavenly!\n\nMy favorite is the High Tea, which comes with all that I mentioned above.  I've had the Queen's Tea but frankly, I don't care for the fruit or the crumpets and if you change your mind and want a petit four, it can be added on for an additional $2.50.  I highly recommend the Vanilla Rooibos tea - my absolute favorite and I actually don't even ask for anything else anymore.  \n\nAlthough it may not sound like it, you will get full off of what appears to be a petite meal.

My party had a little corner of the tea room to ourselves, where they set up a cute little row of sofas and chairs for us to sit at and enjoy our tea. The tea room was decorated shabby chic, and all the tea ware you are served with are mismatched yet adorable; but that adds to the shabby chic vibe!  The teas were phenomenal, I've never had such delicious and fragrant tasting teas in my life! My favorite teas that we sampled that day were the Ginseng tea and Vanilla Rooibos. The food was good, I REALLY recommend everyone order at least one scone for themselves, you might end up ordering more because they are the best things I have ever put in my mouth! They are ridiculously buttery and delicious, I tried to savor my scone as much as I could since it was so good. The sandwiches were pretty good, but not as good as I thought from reading other previous reviews. We ordered the horseradish sandwich with beef (?), I wasn't able to sample it since I don't eat red meat but it was a no go for all of my friends. The curry sandwich was a little overpowering for us. The standouts among the sandwiches were the chicken artichoke & LoveJoy's special. The citrus salad was refreshing and tasty.  What really made my time at LoveJoy's special was at the end of our tea session, the staff came out with a petit four with a little candle on it, which was like a mini personal cake to me!

Yes this 6 foot tall, 200 lbs, one time varsity athlete (now just a weekend warrior) loves his lemon curd and warm scones.  Mmm...cry havoc and set free the drool!\n\nHigh tea here is unpretentious and delicious.  More important to the last vestiges of my masculinity, it is filling and plate lickingly delicious.  Ok, so Lovejoys has far more doilies than a man should volunteer to be around, but the Queen's tea is outstanding enough to get me to turn in my man-card for an afternoon of finger sandwiches every time.  \n\nMen this is how it works when you get the Queen's tea (my recommendation).  First, you get an endless pot of tea (which means I drink several pots without realizing it and spend the rest of the day peeing) and choice of a pair of finger sandwich flavors.   I like egg and onion and pear and gorgonzola the best, but I've had almost every flavor and they are great (although the shrimp one is a bit cat-foody).  The sandwiches come cut in little triangles, but you get a bunch of them so it's satisfying and delicious.  This is all served on a three tiered silver platter/tower, in which the top tier is covered in fruits and the second tier is where the real goodness hides.  Tier two has the warm scones (soft, hot and with raisins) on which you have the option of spreading clotted cream (think super-thick whipped cream), lemon curd (FANTASTIC), and/or fresh berry preserves (highly recommended to combine with the clotted cream).  There are also shortbread cookies in case your heart needed more butter and sugar.  The sandwiches are on their three, along with salad greens and some dressing.  \n\nWhile you scarf up this bounty, over extend your bladder, and whittle away at your manhood, the waitstaff will come by to give you warm crumpets.  Crumpets serve as another vessel for the toppings on tier two.  At this point in your meal when you should be wrestling with, \"I'm a man, I had high tea, I'm full, I think like being fancy... this is so confusing,\" the waitstaff will come out with petit-fours as a knockout blow.  Think bite sized cake.\n\nTo survive Lovejoys use my trick to maintaining the illusion of masculinity: take the women in your life here to celebrate their live events / hollidays.  They will love it, you get to eat the goodness and you can tell your buddies you were forced to go because it was your wife's birthday, because your sister had a wedding shower, etc.  Little will they know that you've turned into a fancy boy just like me.  \n\np.s.

We found a parking spot immediately (perhaps it being 4PM helped) and were seated at once. A minute later, another woman asked us if we were ready to order. Of course we weren't because we were so busy taking pictures of the cute sign on our table that said Reserved for Royalty and were also settling into our lovely seats by the window! The room was packed with mismatched couches, chairs, tables, teacups, teapots and decor but this made it so much more comfortable. I felt I could talk as loud as I wanted, spill tea, whatever, and no one would notice. We finally decided on Queen's Tea (for two) and from the lengthy sandwich list, chose the chicken apple walnut, cucumber and cream cheese, pear and stilton cheese, and bayshrimp and mayonnaise sandwiches. They were all deliciously different in their own ways, however, my favorite was the bayshrimp and mayonnaise sandwich. With the help of our patient server, we picked Taylor's Tea Room Blend and Yorkshire Gold and both were perfectly flavorful. We shared both teas and ironically ended up preferring the one the other picked. To every cup we added cream and sugar and seriously, I couldn't stop drinking. It didn't help that our tea pots were refilled every 10 minutes! Our sandwiches came on a bed of \"spring greens\" which had dressing on the side, and Queen's Tea also came with coleslaw (my mother said it was quite good), scones that had raisins, double devon cream, lemon curd and preserves, fresh fruit, crumpets, shortbread cookies and a petit four for each of us.

"], "author": "Carrie A.", "review": "I went to Lovejoy's for the first time after reading the rave reviews here on Yelp. I usually go to Tranquitea in Pacifica and have experienced a NZ teatime. My thoughts:\n\nPros:\n-TEA SANDWICHES & SCONES. Lovejoy's has an excellent assortment of tea sandwiches. You get to choose from 16 delectable little sandwiches, of which I enjoyed the Chicken-Apple-Walnut and the Chicken & Asparagus. High Tea for Two is an awesome deal.\n\nCons:\n-LACK OF GENUINE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My mom went in to get a table while I found parking. Even though they had four women working, I wasn't greeted at the door and we were only asked how our meal was right at the beginning (when we barely took bites of our food). They topped of my tea without asking if I wanted it topped off (my idea of being wasteful). When the woman served us Petits Fours at the end of our meal, she picked the dessert up w/ the tongs and put it on my dirty lunch plate. Oh, and the Petits Fours were warm.\n-PASTRIES. I've had meatpies overseas, and I really did not enjoy the meatpie here. I ordered the Curried Chicken, and it was definitely too spicy to be enjoying with tea. The pastry shell was not flaky and was quite soggy. It reminded me of one of those microwave pastry deals, but worse.\n-AMBIENCE. The set-up was very cute; however, it did need some tidying up. Our tablecloth was stained with food and the place seemed like it needed some dusting. The area that had tea cups, teas, and collectibles for sale was a bit disorganized. This area drastically needed some cleaning up. Although some might appreciated the mismatched tea sets, I did not.\n\nAlthough Lovejoy's has a nice assortment of teas, it wasn't anything that you wouldn't find at any other tea room.\n\nOverall, Lovejoy's was not the pleasant little tea room that I envisioned it to be. I didn't feel like I was truly having High Tea and felt more like I was eating in a San Francisco diner.\n\nDON'T BOTHER GOING HERE.\n\nMy recommendation: Tranquilitea in Pacifica.

The idea that you are not only able but encouraged to linger over endless pots of tea and nibbles is great.  I was a bit surprised at the rowdiness of the crowd and, consequently, the loudness of the place.  This isn't a deal-breaker for me at all, just something worth noting since it's been mentioned before.  In our case it wasn't screaming children, but it was a large group of excitable women for a wedding shower, I'm guessing.  So, if you're looking for a very upscale, quiet, formal place for tea, this isn't quite it.

They definitely have their aesthetic down.  The atmosphere is very English grandma.  There's cute knick knacks everywhere, and they even have hats available for you to wear while you dine!\n\nWhat I like about their menu is that you can choose your sandwiches.  I don't eat beef, and there have been some times where I can't substitute items without changing my entire order.  I got the turkey with dijon mustard and artichoke hummus for my Queen's tea.  They were both very good.  The Queen's tea also came with a salad and coleslaw.  I wasn't a fan of the salad because it has arugula.  I'm not an fan of it, but it did go well with the coleslaw, which had the right amount of dressing.  I'm glad there was salad, though, because I needed some greens with this meal.\n\nLike most high teas, the Queen's tea came with scones, crumpets, lemon curd, fruit preserves/jam, and Devon cream.

Perfect if you want something lighter or if you're not into the usual scones, crumpets and sandwiches.\n\nFor my tea, I got the Black Vanilla with Lavender, which was recommended by our waitress. Couldn't really taste the lavender but it had a subtle sweetness reminiscent of vanilla. They're very good about refilling your tea pot so it's really bottomless.\n\nNote that they do have a 2 hour limit on the tables!

"], "author": "Miriam W.", "review": "OK, I'm going to split this into a two-pronged attack!\n\n1) TEA WHORES\n\nIf you are a true tea connoisseur and lover and you have at least 5 loose-leaf teas at home in proper temperature controlled and vacuum-sealed containers that did not come to you as a gift in a gift basket, you are a true tea lover. Being a generic tea lover, however, is separate from being a Western-tradition high tea lover, in that, there's East and West. Dimsum-style East, high tea-style West. If you have participated and explored the tea rituals of the west frequently -- you will not see this as five-star place, but you will enjoy it. \n\n2) GENERAL PUBLIC\n\nIt is quaint, it is charming like all the reviews say. The teas are good. Not amazing, but good. The service is ... good enough. It's San Francisco, the place isn't huge. The prices ... are as expected. The ambiance is your dotty grandma's house, stuffed to the gills with tea paraphernalia and family photos, doilies and crochet-work cuddling up the dusty old lampshades. The bathroom is clean and spacious (a rarity in the city). It is filled with many groups of women at various stages of life, from celebrating engagements to graduations to gossiping to catch up. The petit fours are freshly made and moist (I was surprised and impressed by this). The scones are freshly made, as they should be. They do provide proper clotted / Devonshire cream, and luxurious preserves to smear on your scone. They have a good-sized savoury menu aside from tea service.\n\nIf you're not a tea whore and don't really take your high tea very seriously, and you rarely do this sort of thing, you'll be satisfied with the environment and you will have fun, and one tea service will generally make you stuffed and happy.\n\nIf you ARE a tea whore, you will notice some thangs. They aren't major, but cost the fifth star:\n\n- Service: This place has been around a while and is extremely busy and popular, and it's in the city, so I get the \"French maitre'd\" vibe that has happened. Let's just say that the vibe I expect when I go to High Tea is generally about ensuring you are calm, comfortable, looked after, and delighted. We had touch points with multiple staff members and only one staff member was happy and pleasant toward us; the rest treated us like they were busy lor annoyed and that worrying about how busy they were was more important than worrying about the experience for the customers they had. They basically expect that making the food, putting the tea in front of you, the decor, and checking on you once suffices. It does not. I highly recommend that if it's possible all the staff members attend a proper tea (I have yet to find one in SF actually, even at highly rated hotels) and once they have their mind blown they'll get it. It's hard to explain. It's about the experience, the ritual, and being catered to, tea time is sacred in England. Originally, it went on for hours. If you are really trying to recreate that experience, you're not there yet. If you're making your own Cali version ... it's good enough.\n\n- Pricing: A quality tea service doesn't charge you extra for a \"bottomless pot of tea.\" It's included in the price of the service. Also it's SF, so I wasn't surprised by how much you pay for what you get, but it's a little on the stingy side (I was letting it go for the foodstuffs but I got offended that you're paying extra for the tea, since that's the whole point of being there).\n\n- Food: For 3 people, they don't give you particularly generous portions of clotted cream or preserves. We are all trying to watch our weight so we didn't ask for more and made do. Salad is generous. The caraway seed (I think that's the spice) is FAR too overused in their coleslaw salad and I'd frankly they not include that salad and expend that on a free petit four for everybody by default. Quiche looked good; we didn't get to try the crumpets. Scones were good. Sandwiches were on the small side so if you order a tea service with 2 included per person I recommend you order one more for the table to share. Cream cheese is nothing special / has nothing in it (no herbs or seasoning) but the salmon tasted fresh. Basically the sandwiches are super simple and more like tea at home that auntie made versus tea at a fine tea house. Tomato and cheese is straight up tomato and cheese - you could make it at home.\n\n- Tea: As mentioned, good, not amazing. If they spent money on real high quality tea they'd be broke of course, or prices would have to go up significantly. They have a pretty broad selection. I just went with the House Blend, which was okay. Friends ordered other types and were pleased with theirs. The staff made note of how long we should steep the tea, which was great to see.\n\nIf you ever want to have a tea experience that blows your mind -- Brown Hotel in London.

He also had a side of large coffee.\n\nOur total came about to $70-ish (pretty hefty, if you asked me).\n\nMy faves were the crumpet and the lemon curd spread.. yum!!! (i love anything lemony). At the end we were asked to choose 2 Petit four, which is basically a dessert. It's very small, but packed with sweetness.

Really, this is the only tea you'll ever need)\n- Apricot Tea (paled in comparison to the Yorkshire tea)\n\n- Chicken walnut salad sandwiches were delicious! Half white and half whole wheat bread, which is a nod to both tradition and current standards. Also had Branston Pickle Chutney and Cheese, which sounds strange, but is absolutely delicious! Would highly recommend those two sandwiches\n- The salad and coleslaw was okay -- they were skimpy on the mandarins, and the Caraway Cream Dressing was oddly bitter? Mayonaisse-y? Not my favorite part of the meal.\n\n- I learned, finally, how to eat scones properly. And have a proper scone. Which aren't the scones from Starbucks, or wherever you get them. These scones are large and studded with blueberries and are warm, not flaky, like you'd think a biscuit sort of thing should be, but are meant to be cut down the middle, like a bagel, and spread with Devon cream (which isn't normal butter -- it's thicker and whipped and DELICIOUS) and then preserves. Amazing! Absolutely delightful. I'll never have a Starbucks scone again. \n\n- Crumpets. Oh my god. I don't even know what to say about these. There aren't American corollaries, but think of a biscuit, but not flakey. In fact, holey. And warm. And delicious. And should be slathered with the butter and the lemon curd, while the crumpet is still warm. The butter will soak through the crumpet. And so will the lemon curd. It's worth upgrading from High Tea to Queen's Tea to try this sucker out. \n\n- Fruit was good, pretty fresh and ripe, well cut\n- The tea biscuit (which is just a lil tea cookie) was a bit disappointing\n- You get to choose a Petit Four from a platter of many, and they were quite delicious! \n\nDon't forget to make reservations, at least a week or two in advance!

In my opinion, it is one of the more sophisticated teas that exist, and it is amazingly smooth, and just feels good going down (get your mind out the gutter lil' nasty). Afternoon Darjeeling tastes like assam tea and oolong tea mixed together, but it is a thin-bodied, hence the smooth sailing down the piehole... It tastes like a vacation!

I knew nothing about tea parties and had actually never been to a tea before, but I liked the vibe and style of Lovejoy's: playful, mismatched cups and plates (I didn't know this was a \"thing\":), and very true to a British tea experience.

We had several questions and Gillian answered each one thoughtfully and thoroughly.  When the date got closer, she had Nicola, the onsite staff who would set up our tea and food, contact us about logistics.  \nPlanning: It was slightly tricky because I was the main point of contact until my mom was able to join in on the email communication, and she wanted quite a bit more food than I thought we needed, and she had the foresight to ask more questions about dishware, setup, cleanup than I did!  That was fine and Gillian adjusted quotes as we went and had no problem with the multiple changes we made.\nPricing:  Everything was VERY reasonable, and  though I did not look into other places, I'd have a hard time imagining that other catered tea lunches providing the same level of service and quality of food and tea would be this inexpensive.

The catering menu is available online and Samantha helped us square away the details via email in the weeks leading up to it.

You can include a server and a tea leaf reader for your party too, if you're so inclined!\n\nWe didn't lift a finger the day of. Our wonderful server, Carrie, was warm and kind. She arrived on time and set everything up for us. She brought mix matched plates and cups and saucers and tiers for serving the tea sandwiches, scones, crumpets and petit fours we'd ordered. The egg and onion sandwiches were the best, the scones were incredible with the cream and preserves and the White Tangerine tea was a definite favorite. Carrie warmed the scones, toasted the crumpets, poured drinks, continually restocked the food and tea and otherwise  welcomed our guests at every turn. She left the kitchen in great shape and the leftovers in the fridge. All in all, it was a perfectly adorable and shabby chic little ladies tea and our guest of honor loved it.

They were both amazing and satisfaying, and perfectly balance. \nthe second time i went i got the hummus and artichoke sandwich and the chutney and cheese sandwich. the hummus was okay, it was nothing special but it hit the spot, and the chutney was perfect. \n\ntheir scones were amazing, perfectly flaky, just the right amount of sweetness, and the perfect amount of raisins and currants. they were warm, and fresh, and amazing. the creme, jam, and lemon curd were also amazing and complimented the scones and eachother perfectly. \n\nthe shortbread cookies were sooo good, they were thin and cruncy, and so perfectly sweet. \n\nthe coleslaw is ridiculously delicious. I have never liked coleslaw and i am in love with their coleslaw. their sauce is amazing, and they put just the right amount of sauce on their coleslaw, and the rye seeds they add just make the coleslaw so much better than you would ever think coleslaw could be. \n\nthe fresh fruit they serve is also really delicious, although i wish they gave you more\n\nthe crumpets were really good. they were warm and fresh, and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. they were amazing with the lemon curd and the butter. I'm normally not a big crumpet fan, so the second time i went i just got them to give me an extra scone instead of the crumpet, but  you must try the crumpets at least once. \n\nthe petit fours are also amazing. the chocolate truffle with apricot was amazing, the walnut brownie was amazing, and the rose-water was amazing as well. they have a large and delicious petit four selection, and i have loved every single petit four that i have tried. \n\nfinally, their tea selection is amazing. I love their darjeeling, and they always keep your tea hot, and make sure that it's hot. they have a really wide selection of non-caffein teas as well, and they are all delicious. \n\nlovejoy's just has the greatest atmosphere and service and it is seriously the best tea room I have ever been to out of los angeles and san francisco.\n\ni made my friend who hates tea and pastries go to lovejoy's and she is now in love with tea time. that's how good lovejoy's is, it converted my pastry and tea hating friend to a tea time fanatic.\n\nlovejoy's is a must try if you are ever in the bay area, it is an amazing experience!\n\n\njust a side note, on the weekends, and even fridays, you should try to make reservations if you can, although they do also take walk-ins.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-04-25"}, {"excerpts": ["The scones and crumpets were made even more tastey by the lemon curd.

After much searching and disappointment that The Four Seasons Hotels and the Ritz-Carlton Hotels have discontinued their tea service, we found this place on Yelp.\n\nWe were half an hour late (boyfriends are slow) but lucky one person in our party was only 5 minutes late and saved the table for us.  She said they were very nice and didn't harass her about the rest of her party not showing up.\n\nI had the Queen's Tea with English Breakfast tea and cucumber and turkey sandwiches.  The tea arrived first and after waiting anxiously for it to seep, I poured myself a cup.  It was delicious, but I am not a tea connoisseur.  Then arrived the food, on a three tiered platter.  The top tier was the fresh fruit, next the scone, biscuit, jam, lemon stuff, and the devon cream, the bottom tier had the sandwiches, cole slaw, and greens.\n\nTo be frank, when I first looked at it I thought they kind of skimped out on the fruit, but I was stuffed by the end of my meal, so really they are smarter than me!\n\nAfter having some fruit, I decided to try the scone.  I first tried the devon cream...and that is when I realized that I loved this place!  If I had a lover, forget the whipped cream or chocolate sauce, this is what I'd cover his body with and lick off!!!  I could not get enough of it and I think this was my favorite item here.  Of course the jam and lemon stuff was good too, but I cannot describe my devotion to devon cream now.\n\nThe sandwiches were of course delicious and...dainty, delicate?  FUN!  I am not a super girlie girl.  My friend and I decided to put dresses on for the special occasion and I felt like a streetwalker even though my dress is conservative, but that is how rarely I wear things that don't have legs.  But this place played into my feminine side without me feeling awkward about it.  So yes, it's frilly and kitsch, but it works for this place.\n\nA little while later came my fresh crumpet.  We decided crumpets are a pancake-english muffin hybrid, a puffin. Delicious, but I just wanted to get back to my scone and devon cream to be honest.\n\nLastly when we were done, we had our petite fours.  Which apparently I didn't really experience because I got the dark chocolate truffle with dried apricot.  But it was so cute and I love dark chocolate.  Petite fours are candy-sized, individually glazed pieces of cake. (My friend went to culinary school)\n\nI completely want to return, but will probably only get the High Tea or even just the Light Tea next time.  The Queen's Tea was fantastic for the first time, so you get the entire experience and learn what you like.  But I personally didn't really like the cole slaw (I'm too American and eating it made me want ribs or something) and I was too full to even consider wasting space on a salad!\n\nSo if you go, invite me?", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["The crumpets were also quite tasty but the lemon curd really made the crumpet amazing.

It's a lot smaller and cozier than I thought it would be, but if you are with your best friends then it allows for a more intimate tea party!  \n\nWe opted against ordering a tea sets since there were so many of us, and just ordered a bottomless pot of Earl Grey ($8) with each additional person being $1 more.  Then we ordered a lot of food a la carte.  There is a 9.95 minimum per person so we were forced to order more food than we could actually finish, believe it or not.  We came here starving and left incredibly sated.\n\nThe scones are amazing.  Warm and soft, combined with the clotted cream and strawberry jam... mmm... Surprisingly easy to break up into pieces so you shouldn't eat an entire one by yourself or you'll have no room for other food.  I was really heartbroken to see jars and jars of Smuckers jam in their storage pantry while waiting in line for the bathroom.  \n\nThe crumpets are so-so, save for the lemon curd.  \n\nOrdered a large plate of sandwiches, which allowed us to get 3 sandwiches, quartered.  We ordered 1. bay shrimp and mayo, 2. salmon mousse, 3. pear and stilton.  I only tried the last two, but they were both yummy.  The pear and stilton was very unique, as was the salmon mousse.  Sandwiches are served on a bed of greens, cool.  Also came with coleslaw which was surprisingly good.\n\nWe got a chicken curry pasti (pronounced the A as in PASTA not PASTE) which was AMAZING!  Didn't even need the dipping sauce.  The shell was flaky and hot, the inside was flavorful and fragrant.  So great.  \n\nTo get to our 9.95 minimum we ordered the Beef Pasti which was definitely not as good as the chicken one.  \n\nWe also got an order of the sausage rolls, which are ridiculously hard to cut in halves.  Interesting taste, but would not recommend it.  \n\nSince it was my birthday I got a petite four that was banana-flavored.  It was really cute and thoughtful but less tasty.  They come around with a platter of petite fours for $2.50 each.  We thought they were just giving us all petite fours for free -_- \n\nAll in all, Lovejoy's was everything I wanted it to be.

Now, food-wise I'm as manly as they come, but even I can't say 'no' to a tower of food along with an accompanying pinch of civilization.\n\nBeing from L.A., I know about the horrible, nearly nonexistent street parking of S.F. and this place didn't disappoint. However, persistence paid off and I found a space across from their storefront.\n\nLocated in Noe Valley, along MUNI's J Line on Church Street (alas, there's no station nearby) Lovejoy's fits right in; quaint, old-world charm with a healthy dose of Victorian kitzch. It's sort of like being transported back in time; a doily-friendly lunching space with curtains, lamps, and other knick-knacks compelling you to sit down on a couch or table and have a cup of tea. \n\nAnd a scone. \n\nWith clotted cream.\n\nAnd some finger sandwiches. \n\nOr two...\n\nAnd a petit four. \n\nAnd... and...\n\nWe opted for sharing a Queen's Tea, the name of which felt like a challenge to my masculinity, but I gotta say that both of us were stuffed afterwards.

Our friend mentioned a shepherd's pie, which thankfully, we didn't order.  \n\nThe thing I like about afternoon tea is the sense of civilization it imparts to the senses, similar to a kaiseki meal or a cocktail hour with aperitifs, clinking ice, and tony cocktail glasses. I might also mention that the prices are also on the civilized side. I've never found afternoon tea to be a bargain outing and Lovejoy's is no exception, yet I've never come across a place as charmingly quaint as Lovejoy's. \n\nIt's most definitely a place to relax and take your time; savoring the experience in a cozy atmosphere.

Side note: one of my sisters brought my siblings and I over to this place for her birthday, my only visit to this place.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last paragraph, this is a British tea place.  Obviously, the place has the British look when you go inside.  Oh and of course, this is definitely a place ladies generally should feel at ease.\n\nWhat was good about the place?  I like the surroundings.  The server we had was wonderful.  The staff members as a whole were wonderful I should say.  Of course, the tea would be good. (This is a tea place after all.) You are given your milk and sugar.  Oh and it is awesome that they carry jade tea, but even if your not much of a tea person, there are other drinks to choose from like coffee and hot chocolate. (Side note: for tea and coffee, I need milk and sugar, but I never put either in jade tea.)\n\nNow, I bring out the flaws.  The place is pricey, but it's San Francisco, and adding on, I'll mention a more horrid flaw regarding money in a bit.  I know that this a tea place, but the food was lackluster.  Outside of the scones, a good amount of the food was mediocre at best.  The place is so small, I wonder how someone like Mr. Corey Maggette would manage to feel comfortable without a chair.  Parking is such a bother, but again, it's San Francisco.  I better mention now that the more horrid flaw regarding money (which I checked out just recently) is that each person must spend a little under $10 meaning that for example, if you're just by yourself, you can't just get a crumpet and milk and be good to go because you just spent $7.37 only before the tip.  Even if you add the tip, you're still under the minimum, as that's only $8.48.\n\nI need to get a couple of notes out of the way.  Obviously, if you plan on coming here, make a reservation ahead of time.  Also, you can purchase the cups and other items.  Just go to the store across the street.\n\nI love the atmosphere.  I love the service we received.  I don't love the lackluster food and the money issues.  Lovejoy's is a place I don't mind going to again for tea with crumpets and biscuits.

Yes this 6 foot tall, 200 lbs, one time varsity athlete (now just a weekend warrior) loves his lemon curd and warm scones.  Mmm...cry havoc and set free the drool!\n\nHigh tea here is unpretentious and delicious.  More important to the last vestiges of my masculinity, it is filling and plate lickingly delicious.  Ok, so Lovejoys has far more doilies than a man should volunteer to be around, but the Queen's tea is outstanding enough to get me to turn in my man-card for an afternoon of finger sandwiches every time.  \n\nMen this is how it works when you get the Queen's tea (my recommendation).  First, you get an endless pot of tea (which means I drink several pots without realizing it and spend the rest of the day peeing) and choice of a pair of finger sandwich flavors.   I like egg and onion and pear and gorgonzola the best, but I've had almost every flavor and they are great (although the shrimp one is a bit cat-foody).  The sandwiches come cut in little triangles, but you get a bunch of them so it's satisfying and delicious.  This is all served on a three tiered silver platter/tower, in which the top tier is covered in fruits and the second tier is where the real goodness hides.  Tier two has the warm scones (soft, hot and with raisins) on which you have the option of spreading clotted cream (think super-thick whipped cream), lemon curd (FANTASTIC), and/or fresh berry preserves (highly recommended to combine with the clotted cream).  There are also shortbread cookies in case your heart needed more butter and sugar.  The sandwiches are on their three, along with salad greens and some dressing.  \n\nWhile you scarf up this bounty, over extend your bladder, and whittle away at your manhood, the waitstaff will come by to give you warm crumpets.  Crumpets serve as another vessel for the toppings on tier two.  At this point in your meal when you should be wrestling with, \"I'm a man, I had high tea, I'm full, I think like being fancy... this is so confusing,\" the waitstaff will come out with petit-fours as a knockout blow.  Think bite sized cake.\n\nTo survive Lovejoys use my trick to maintaining the illusion of masculinity: take the women in your life here to celebrate their live events / hollidays.  They will love it, you get to eat the goodness and you can tell your buddies you were forced to go because it was your wife's birthday, because your sister had a wedding shower, etc.  Little will they know that you've turned into a fancy boy just like me.  \n\np.s.

We found a parking spot immediately (perhaps it being 4PM helped) and were seated at once. A minute later, another woman asked us if we were ready to order. Of course we weren't because we were so busy taking pictures of the cute sign on our table that said Reserved for Royalty and were also settling into our lovely seats by the window! The room was packed with mismatched couches, chairs, tables, teacups, teapots and decor but this made it so much more comfortable. I felt I could talk as loud as I wanted, spill tea, whatever, and no one would notice. We finally decided on Queen's Tea (for two) and from the lengthy sandwich list, chose the chicken apple walnut, cucumber and cream cheese, pear and stilton cheese, and bayshrimp and mayonnaise sandwiches. They were all deliciously different in their own ways, however, my favorite was the bayshrimp and mayonnaise sandwich. With the help of our patient server, we picked Taylor's Tea Room Blend and Yorkshire Gold and both were perfectly flavorful. We shared both teas and ironically ended up preferring the one the other picked. To every cup we added cream and sugar and seriously, I couldn't stop drinking.

I may be in the wrong situation to appreciate this place properly, since I was the only solo customer there, and an endless pot of tea might be good for a group, and pooling your money for a large platter of goodies might pay off. And as for atmosphere, granted I may have more slow digestive system than average, but it's hard to fully relax and appreciate the atmosphere as much as you might when the server asks you if you're all done because other parties need your table.

With Lovejoy's you can choose which tea sandwiches you want with your tea service, and they have plenty of meat, seafood, and vegetarian options.

A bit pricey for the amount of fruits served.\n\nTea choices:\n\nDarjeeling - A good complement with the food. Not a too heavy tea. Quite enjoyed it.\n\nTea House Blend - A nice blend w a slight bitter aftertaste. Not one of my favorites but adding milk and sugar still made it pretty tasty. Slightly heavier tea flavor. \n\nService: \n\nFantastic service. Servers were warm and attentive. Food arrival was fast.

If you're in a hurry to go somewhere, I suggest you to give yourself a 3 hour time frame to relax. \n\nMy friend and I got the Queen's Tea ($28 pp). This comes with your choice of two sandwiches, served with cabbage salad in a caraway cream dressing, organic spring greens, a scone with preserves and Devon cream, a crumpet with Meyer Lemon Curd, fresh fruit, a petit four and a tea biscuit. \n\nThe Petit four will be served at the end and you get  your choice of ONE dessert; if you pick two, there will be an additional $2.50 charge on your bill (my mistake). Their petit fours were adorable as it had a Christmas theme to it :) I think my favorite of the two sandwiches - smoked salmon & cream cheese and one of their daily specials, was probably the smoked salmon & cream cheese - you can never go wrong with that! It was delish, though I can't describe in detail, since it's been awhile since I last went.\n\nI'd love to come back again, when I can find a lady-friend to come with!

Even though my fondest memories were in England, drinking tea is a global phenomenon that many people from all the different parts of the world partake in. When I was in college, I studied abroad in England and one thing I miss most is the amazing tasting teas & the tearooms! Pinkies up! \n\nOf course, tearooms are more widespread in the land of the monarchy, but it's nice to know one of them is a 10-minute drive from my place in SF. Parking is very easy to find even on the weekends. We were able to find street parking a block away. Beware of street signs if you park in the afternoon on weekdays. The tea room is only open Wednesdays to Sundays until 6PM. Last feeding (their words not mine) is at 4:30PM. I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially on the weekends just so you secure yourself a spot in this quaint and cozy little tearoom. You can reserve up to 2 hours in advanced if you're not quite sure of your schedule until the day of. They usually don't pick up, so make sure you leave a message & they'll return your call right away. \n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at this cute little table by the window and on the table, there was a sign that said \"reserved for royalty\". I know at one point I wanted to marry Prince William, but that hardly makes me royal. Regardless, that made me feel very special. The tearoom is small, probably fitting only about 7-10 tables tops. But I think this creates a very intimate experience. Our waitress was very attentive and I felt like she was able to get us everything we needed, which was probably because the space accommodated a handful of people (a plus!). Our waitress was also very knowledgeable about the teas and didn't mind waiting until we perused through the extensive menu that included over 20 different teas! \n\nWe ended up ordering the high tea and \"me\" tea with black vanilla lavender tea and darjeeling tea-- both of my new favorites. What I loved about the tea was that it was loose leaf, which is definitely the healthier type of tea (tea bags contain added chemicals that aren't good for you). With the tea, we were able to order sandwiches and a side pastry. I ordered the darjeeling with the chicken and asparagus & salmon and cream cheese sandwiches. My brother ordered his vanilla lavender tea with the daily special sandwich-- which was cranberry and turkey (reminded me of Thanksgiving). Along with my sandwiches came a delicious scone with a side of strawberry jam and butter; while my brother chose a crumpet, his personal favorite, with a side of lemon spread. The sandwiches also came with a salad and vinaigrette. I think the food was excellent and it paired very well with the tea. \n\nThe tea is a bit pricey (bill was $40 for 2), but I think it was worth it given the wonderful experience that my brother and I had. I definitely want to come back another time with family and friends.

You can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices. All of their daintily cut sandwiches are packed with massive flavors. We also loved the blueberry scones, which were soft and light. Spread some of their tantalizing strawberry jam and you are in sweet pastry heaven. The crumpet was the only thing that we weren't crazy about. It's a waffle-cake hybrid: part waffle in texture but tastes like pancake. It was also very fluffy and hard to cut. We were presented with an assortment of Petit Fours after our meal.

We were smitten with the perfectly mismatched china and eclectic setting. This place is essentially an antique shop that serves tea. I'm pretty sure if my grandmas were British, they would be sitting in a place like Lovejoy's sipping on some tea and petting their furry kitties.\n\nQuick tips:\n- Make reservations because seating is limited and due to its popularity, Lovejoy's accommodates very few walk-ins. \n- There is a two hour maximum seating time and they will kindly inform you that your time is up and you need to bounce (not in those exact words).\n- Use the restroom before you leave!

The service flowed seamlessly.\n\nThe gluten free scone was warm and soft. It had a nice flavor and the lemon curd, preserves and clotted cream complimented it well. \n\nThe gluten free bread was seriously THE BEST gluten free bread I have ever eaten. In fact, I'm not even sure if it was gluten free (okay, I am...the bread was brown in color and still had the crusts on; my dining partner had wheat flour based bread and the crusts were removed). But seriously, THE BEST gluten free bread I have ever eaten. I had the cucumber cream cheese and one of their daily specials...I think it was a turkey and chutney. I'd skip the turkey and chutney concoction and head for the salmon mousse to go along with cucumber cream cheese next time. \n\nThe cabbage salad with caraway is a favorite of mine. I've always enjoyed it. I've tried to replicate it at home...but I can never make it the same. \n\nI always enjoy the delicate green salad with the vinaigrette. \n\nThe fruit was fresh.\n\nThe tea biscuit was tasty. \n\nThe crumpet...well...the crumpet was actually an english muffin from Kinnikinnick.

I love all things lemon, so this was perfect. It was moist and lovely. It was actually the first cake pop I ever had. They weren't popular back in the days when I was eating gluten and now that they've made their way into many markets, I hadn't had a chance to try one until I had the Queen's Tea at Lovejoy's. \n\nIn short, a lovely tea experience.

These scones are large and studded with blueberries and are warm, not flaky, like you'd think a biscuit sort of thing should be, but are meant to be cut down the middle, like a bagel, and spread with Devon cream (which isn't normal butter -- it's thicker and whipped and DELICIOUS) and then preserves. Amazing! Absolutely delightful. I'll never have a Starbucks scone again. \n\n- Crumpets. Oh my god. I don't even know what to say about these. There aren't American corollaries, but think of a biscuit, but not flakey. In fact, holey. And warm. And delicious.

But the rose black tea is also awesome.\n\nService: the servers are always very nice, not extra nice, but they serve you right. Sometimes it is very busy, and they don't have time to charm you because, well, the tearoom itself can entertain you and the company of your choice should entertain you. They do get 5 stars for service. They keep everything short and sweet! Your will arrive at your table \"reserved for rotalty\" with a pretty plate of hot crumpets and butter during the middle of your meal. This is when you drop whatever you have in your hand, pick up your butter knife, thereupon smearing your butter over your nice hot crumpet and enjoy while it's fresh and hot. Oh, believe me, it's worth getting enthusiastic about. It's like if Lana del Ray arrived at your door at night offering to sing you some lullabies. That exciting!!!! Notice she's my current and always and forever crush. Anyway, you can of course devour that wonderous duo of crumpet and butter alone or savor it with a bit of lemon curd or strawberry jam. You're royalty when you're here, so you can do as you well damn please ;) You will also get a petite four at the end of you're meal. They usually have the option of strawberry, white wedding cake (my fav), esspresso, rice crispy treat, chocolate and apricot, among others I forget at the moment. \n\nCome to this lovely little tea room, you'll notice your pinky will automatically go up as you drink your cup of tea. It's not a mystery, it will just happen. Don't question it.

But it wasn't. And I hate people on cell phones pretty much everywhere, so I understood, but it happened to be my birthday and I was sitting alone, so a friend called to take pity on me. I told the waitress, and she gave me a free dessert with a candle. *And* they took off from my bill the dessert they hocked. So, good on them for trying to right the situation.\n\nThis place tends to book reservations a week in advance, so call early.

I had so many vanilla type teas I rolled my eyes when I saw the menu.  But when I tried my friends cup, I was blown away.  The vanilla flavor wasn't anything I have tasted before.  I hate it when I have vanilla tea or flavored anything because it just reminds me of extract.

I love that the waitress comes from time to time to check if the tea is still hot otherwise they bring you a fresh hot pot back. \n\nWithin the Queen's tea you get a choice of 2 sandwich selections.  My friend got the savory tea so we got to taste a total of 4 types of sandwiches.  They quarter the sandwiches into adorable bite size triangles. \nWe selected the following:\n1) Chicken-Apple-Walnut- You could taste the crispness of the apple still. The ratio of the 3 items were good and the mayo wasn't overly lathered to mask the individual flavors. \n\n2) Pear Stilton- With my recent discovery that I actually like blue cheese I got this one. The stilton was so creamy and gave such a great nutty taste and the pear was thinly sliced and retained the crunchiness still. It's a perfect combo! \n\n3)Cream Cheese and Mandarin Orange- this one was just ok, cream cheese and canned oranges. \n\n4) Love joy's daily special ( that day it was a smoked trout w/ capers). I loved smoked fish!!! The capers weren't too salty and the smoked trout definitely had the spotlight and wasn't masked. \n\nalong with the sandwiches I also had a wonderful warm scone that was flaky and crumbly enough. I liked the strawberry preserve that came with it and used the lemon curd on it as well. The double devon cream was ok used in moderation but a thick slab of it on the scone was too rich for me. \n\nThe queens tea also comes with fresh fruit , spring greens salad and coleslaw. Their coleslaw is interesting as its the first time i had fennel seed in one. It was pretty good. \n\nI wasn't too fond of the crumpet that was served. It was too big and hard to chew. Icouldn't cut it apart.\n\nThe sugar cookie /shortbread  was made perfectly and lightly dusted with sugar.\n\nLast was the selection of a petit fours. I chose the orange creme one that had a ribbon of dark chocolate in it. It was a bit too sweet for me so when I come back next time I'll probably get the triple dark chocolate one which was the runner-up. \n\nThe morning passed quickly into afternoon spent here chatting with my friend and we both enjoyed the service and hospitality. I would definitely bring my friends back here for a Girls day out. \n\nP.S: they give you a 10% off coupon if you visit Love Joy's attic found across the street if you like to bring back a souvenir of the tea you had or various tea cups pots etc.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-04-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I'm normally not a big crumpet fan, so the second time i went ", "i just got them to give me an extra scone instead of the crumpet, but  "], "author": "Rebecca A.", "review": "Oh my god, this place is the best tea room I have ever been to. \nlet me just preface this by saying that I am part British, and i have been going to tea rooms since i could remember, and i daresay that this is the best tea room i have ever been to. \n\nThe decor is soooo cute, and comfy, and this tea room has a great atmosphere and ambiance.

I got the smoked salmon with cream cheese, and Lovejoy's special, which was chicken and pesto. Both were unimpressive and was much too creamy. The Devon Cream made me feel as if I were eating butter. I've had better scones elsewhere. The strawberry preserves they gave us was definitely not homemade, and reminded me of smuckers (didn't even spring for Bonne Maman!), and the lemon curd was not tart enough.\n\nBut the tea was fantastic!

After much searching and disappointment that The Four Seasons Hotels and the Ritz-Carlton Hotels have discontinued their tea service, we found this place on Yelp.\n\nWe were half an hour late (boyfriends are slow) but lucky one person in our party was only 5 minutes late and saved the table for us.  She said they were very nice and didn't harass her about the rest of her party not showing up.\n\nI had the Queen's Tea with English Breakfast tea and cucumber and turkey sandwiches.  The tea arrived first and after waiting anxiously for it to seep, I poured myself a cup.  It was delicious, but I am not a tea connoisseur.  Then arrived the food, on a three tiered platter.  The top tier was the fresh fruit, next the scone, biscuit, jam, lemon stuff, and the devon cream, the bottom tier had the sandwiches, cole slaw, and greens.\n\nTo be frank, when I first looked at it I thought they kind of skimped out on the fruit, but I was stuffed by the end of my meal, so really they are smarter than me!\n\nAfter having some fruit, I decided to try the scone.  I first tried the devon cream...and that is when I realized that I loved this place!  If I had a lover, forget the whipped cream or chocolate sauce, this is what I'd cover his body with and lick off!!!  I could not get enough of it and I think this was my favorite item here.  Of course the jam and lemon stuff was good too, but I cannot describe my devotion to devon cream now.\n\nThe sandwiches were of course delicious and...dainty, delicate?  FUN!  I am not a super girlie girl.  My friend and I decided to put dresses on for the special occasion and I felt like a streetwalker even though my dress is conservative, but that is how rarely I wear things that don't have legs.  But this place played into my feminine side without me feeling awkward about it.  So yes, it's frilly and kitsch, but it works for this place.\n\nA little while later came my fresh crumpet.  We decided crumpets are a pancake-english muffin hybrid, a puffin. Delicious, but I just wanted to get back to my scone and devon cream to be honest.\n\nLastly when we were done, we had our petite fours.  Which apparently I didn't really experience because I got the dark chocolate truffle with dried apricot.  But it was so cute and I love dark chocolate.  Petite fours are candy-sized, individually glazed pieces of cake. (My friend went to culinary school)\n\nI completely want to return, but will probably only get the High Tea or even just the Light Tea next time.  The Queen's Tea was fantastic for the first time, so you get the entire experience and learn what you like.

I like the surroundings.  The server we had was wonderful.  The staff members as a whole were wonderful I should say.  Of course, the tea would be good. (This is a tea place after all.) You are given your milk and sugar.  Oh and it is awesome that they carry jade tea, but even if your not much of a tea person, there are other drinks to choose from like coffee and hot chocolate. (Side note: for tea and coffee, I need milk and sugar, but I never put either in jade tea.)\n\nNow, I bring out the flaws.  The place is pricey, but it's San Francisco, and adding on, I'll mention a more horrid flaw regarding money in a bit.  I know that this a tea place, but the food was lackluster.  Outside of the scones, a good amount of the food was mediocre at best.  The place is so small, I wonder how someone like Mr. Corey Maggette would manage to feel comfortable without a chair.  Parking is such a bother, but again, it's San Francisco.  I better mention now that the more horrid flaw regarding money (which I checked out just recently) is that each person must spend a little under $10 meaning that for example, if you're just by yourself, you can't just get a crumpet and milk and be good to go because you just spent $7.37 only before the tip.

We walked in on a weekday afternoon and were immediately seated. It wasn't busy at all. As everyone says it's quite another matter on weekends. The service was perfectly fine. The food and the tea were sub-par.\n\nI feel I must explain what Cream Tea is before I review what I was served.  A cream tea doesn't mean tea which is creamy. A cream tea is a scone served with clotted cream, optionally (though usually) also jam, and a pot of tea. It is a kind of set piece. Clotted cream is a kind of delicious creamy thing about halfway between the most delicate butter you've ever had and whipped cream. It is, not too put too fine a point on it, the very heart of cream tea. You want a generous amount of it. I know all this from having had a great deal of cream tea in England in a variety of tea places. \n\nI ordered cream tea, which came with two scones, about a scant tablespoon of clotted cream, a little bit of jam, and some fresh fruit. A tablespoon of clotted cream is not enough for one scone, never mind for two. There should have been at least three times that much clotted cream. I am not exaggerating or being facetious. You want to be able to spread a thick amount of clotted cream and then have enough left to lick out of the container like a barbarian, if you can get away with it. I understand that they are importing clotted cream in tiny jars from the UK at great expense, but considering how much the whole cream tea costs, I think they could afford to be more generous with the stuff. It's also possible to make your own clotted cream from scratch, and the only problem is you have to make rather a lot of it at once which shouldn't be such an issue for a shop that specializes in tea. \n\nInexplicably, the scones were heated up. I realize it says that on the menu and perhaps I ought not to have been surprised. But I was surprised because scones should not be warmed up. They should be fresh, but not warm and certainly not re-warmed. Rewarming scones is just not done. I don't know how else to put that. It's incorrect. Aside from it being not done, it's also a bad idea because it will melt your delicious clotted cream and ruin its texture and coolness. It also can't be good for the texture of the scones. \n\nThese were raisin scones, which in my experience are sometimes a bit more solid rather than crumbly, and maybe if they had not been re-heated they would have been on the far end of the acceptable range of scone textures. They were not the right texture. They utterly lacked any crumbliness. Sure, if you're used to Starbucks scones, you might be impressed. But if you are expecting an English style scone, these are not that. They are incorrect.\n\nThe jam was fine, though still a little bit less than I would really expect.\n\nTo summarize, there was not enough clotted cream and the scones were wrong.\n\nNow let us move on to the tea. I ordered the house blend black tea, and it was a very good full-bodied tea. Milk was provided, as it should be. It was loose-leaf and came in a teapot. You had to strain it with a little strainer when pouring because the leaves are put directly in the teapot. Which is OK and I can't say it's not correct, lots of English people do it that way.\n\nThe tea was good for the first cup. Because there was no way to take out the tea leaves, it inevitably became over-brewed for subsequent cups. When I got very close to the bottom of the teapot, the waitress came by to \"warm up\" the pot to make good on the promise of bottomless tea. I can't be 100% sure about what happened next. Based on the flavor of the tea it seems like the old tea leaves were not replaced and either more hot water was added or more hot water with some more leaves. Anyway it was bitter and not very good a that point. The whole tea part of the experience could be improved by putting the looseleaf tea in a brewing basket (which is not heretical in any way and lots of English tea houses do it, and it's not like authenticity appears to be a concern at this teahouse). \n\nEverything that went wrong could be fixed with a little bit of effort and care. That's part of why I'm writing this review. I'd love for nothing more than to be able to pay slightly too much money for a very good cream tea without flying all the way to England.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure lots of people will continue to have a nice time playing dress-up and doing England cosplay at this highly atmospheric cute little joint.

My friend got the pom green so it was a win/win. They allow you to have a whiff of the dry tea leaves first to help with the tea selection but trust me the dry tea leaves do not do the black mango tea justice.\n\n Dry tea leaves are a bit musky but when it was steeped and poured out you can smell and definitely taste the mango scent and presence.

They quarter the sandwiches into adorable bite size triangles. \nWe selected the following:\n1) Chicken-Apple-Walnut- You could taste the crispness of the apple still. The ratio of the 3 items were good and the mayo wasn't overly lathered to mask the individual flavors. \n\n2) Pear Stilton- With my recent discovery that I actually like blue cheese I got this one. The stilton was so creamy and gave such a great nutty taste and the pear was thinly sliced and retained the crunchiness still. It's a perfect combo! \n\n3)Cream Cheese and Mandarin Orange- this one was just ok, cream cheese and canned oranges. \n\n4) Love joy's daily special ( that day it was a smoked trout w/ capers). I loved smoked fish!!! The capers weren't too salty and the smoked trout definitely had the spotlight and wasn't masked. \n\nalong with the sandwiches I also had a wonderful warm scone that was flaky and crumbly enough. I liked the strawberry preserve that came with it and used the lemon curd on it as well. The double devon cream was ok used in moderation but a thick slab of it on the scone was too rich for me. \n\nThe queens tea also comes with fresh fruit , spring greens salad and coleslaw. Their coleslaw is interesting as its the first time i had fennel seed in one. It was pretty good. \n\nI wasn't too fond of the crumpet that was served. It was too big and hard to chew. Icouldn't cut it apart.\n\nThe sugar cookie /shortbread  was made perfectly and lightly dusted with sugar.\n\nLast was the selection of a petit fours.

She said they were very nice and didn't harass her about the rest of her party not showing up.\n\nI had the Queen's Tea with English Breakfast tea and cucumber and turkey sandwiches.  The tea arrived first and after waiting anxiously for it to seep, I poured myself a cup.  It was delicious, but I am not a tea connoisseur.  Then arrived the food, on a three tiered platter.  The top tier was the fresh fruit, next the scone, biscuit, jam, lemon stuff, and the devon cream, the bottom tier had the sandwiches, cole slaw, and greens.\n\nTo be frank, when I first looked at it I thought they kind of skimped out on the fruit, but I was stuffed by the end of my meal, so really they are smarter than me!\n\nAfter having some fruit, I decided to try the scone.  I first tried the devon cream...and that is when I realized that I loved this place!  If I had a lover, forget the whipped cream or chocolate sauce, this is what I'd cover his body with and lick off!!!  I could not get enough of it and I think this was my favorite item here.  Of course the jam and lemon stuff was good too, but I cannot describe my devotion to devon cream now.\n\nThe sandwiches were of course delicious and...dainty, delicate?  FUN!  I am not a super girlie girl.  My friend and I decided to put dresses on for the special occasion and I felt like a streetwalker even though my dress is conservative, but that is how rarely I wear things that don't have legs.  But this place played into my feminine side without me feeling awkward about it.  So yes, it's frilly and kitsch, but it works for this place.\n\nA little while later came my fresh crumpet.  We decided crumpets are a pancake-english muffin hybrid, a puffin. Delicious, but I just wanted to get back to my scone and devon cream to be honest.\n\nLastly when we were done, we had our petite fours.

Being a generic tea lover, however, is separate from being a Western-tradition high tea lover, in that, there's East and West. Dimsum-style East, high tea-style West. If you have participated and explored the tea rituals of the west frequently -- you will not see this as five-star place, but you will enjoy it. \n\n2) GENERAL PUBLIC\n\nIt is quaint, it is charming like all the reviews say. The teas are good. Not amazing, but good. The service is ... good enough. It's San Francisco, the place isn't huge. The prices ... are as expected. The ambiance is your dotty grandma's house, stuffed to the gills with tea paraphernalia and family photos, doilies and crochet-work cuddling up the dusty old lampshades. The bathroom is clean and spacious (a rarity in the city). It is filled with many groups of women at various stages of life, from celebrating engagements to graduations to gossiping to catch up. The petit fours are freshly made and moist (I was surprised and impressed by this). The scones are freshly made, as they should be. They do provide proper clotted / Devonshire cream, and luxurious preserves to smear on your scone. They have a good-sized savoury menu aside from tea service.\n\nIf you're not a tea whore and don't really take your high tea very seriously, and you rarely do this sort of thing, you'll be satisfied with the environment and you will have fun, and one tea service will generally make you stuffed and happy.\n\nIf you ARE a tea whore, you will notice some thangs. They aren't major, but cost the fifth star:\n\n- Service: This place has been around a while and is extremely busy and popular, and it's in the city, so I get the \"French maitre'd\" vibe that has happened. Let's just say that the vibe I expect when I go to High Tea is generally about ensuring you are calm, comfortable, looked after, and delighted. We had touch points with multiple staff members and only one staff member was happy and pleasant toward us; the rest treated us like they were busy lor annoyed and that worrying about how busy they were was more important than worrying about the experience for the customers they had. They basically expect that making the food, putting the tea in front of you, the decor, and checking on you once suffices. It does not. I highly recommend that if it's possible all the staff members attend a proper tea (I have yet to find one in SF actually, even at highly rated hotels) and once they have their mind blown they'll get it. It's hard to explain. It's about the experience, the ritual, and being catered to, tea time is sacred in England. Originally, it went on for hours. If you are really trying to recreate that experience, you're not there yet. If you're making your own Cali version ... it's good enough.\n\n- Pricing: A quality tea service doesn't charge you extra for a \"bottomless pot of tea.\" It's included in the price of the service. Also it's SF, so I wasn't surprised by how much you pay for what you get, but it's a little on the stingy side (I was letting it go for the foodstuffs but I got offended that you're paying extra for the tea, since that's the whole point of being there).\n\n- Food: For 3 people, they don't give you particularly generous portions of clotted cream or preserves. We are all trying to watch our weight so we didn't ask for more and made do. Salad is generous. The caraway seed (I think that's the spice) is FAR too overused in their coleslaw salad and I'd frankly they not include that salad and expend that on a free petit four for everybody by default. Quiche looked good; we didn't get to try the crumpets. Scones were good. Sandwiches were on the small side so if you order a tea service with 2 included per person I recommend you order one more for the table to share. Cream cheese is nothing special / has nothing in it (no herbs or seasoning) but the salmon tasted fresh. Basically the sandwiches are super simple and more like tea at home that auntie made versus tea at a fine tea house. Tomato and cheese is straight up tomato and cheese - you could make it at home.\n\n- Tea: As mentioned, good, not amazing. If they spent money on real high quality tea they'd be broke of course, or prices would have to go up significantly. They have a pretty broad selection. I just went with the House Blend, which was okay. Friends ordered other types and were pleased with theirs. The staff made note of how long we should steep the tea, which was great to see.\n\nIf you ever want to have a tea experience that blows your mind -- Brown Hotel in London.

After doing some reading some reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I knew that Lovejoy's would be the perfect place to enjoy a pot of tea in the city for the very first time. My friend got a reservation for Thursday afternoon at 4pm, which turns out we didn't even need it as it wasn't packed at all at this time of day.\n\nThere are a lot of great options at Lovejoy's for tea and sandwich lovers alike. Since we were newcomers to all of this, we asked our server what she would recommend for two tea lovers who also wanted to try a lot of traditional British goodies and who also wanted to just sit back and take it all in. She suggested we get the High Tea which consisted for our choice of two tea sandwiches served with organic spring greens, cabbage salad in a caraway cream dressing, a warm scone served with preserves and Devon cream and a tea biscuit to boot. At $21.95 for all of that, we felt that that was a very affordable deal. Since she knew we were going to stay a while she suggested we get one more sandwich (at an additional $3.95) to go with this combination to satisfy our taste buds. We agreed and although all of the sandwich options looked plenty good but we knew we had to get the traditional sandwich that pairs perfectly with English tea, cucumber and cream cheese, in addition to the roast beef and horseradish and ham and English mustard options.\n\nServed on a two tiered cake stand, with the scone on top and the sandwiches and salads on the larger bottom tier, everything tasted amazing. I loved the scone especially when spread with the Devon cream and preserves. The sandwiches were so tasty, I especially loved the traditional cucumber sandwich made with real English cucumbers. The horseradish gave the roast beef a real kick, so be wary when biting into them. The sandwiches and salads paired very well with our tea, which was also selected with our server's advice, when we asked what went well with milk, we went with the Yorkshire Gold Black Tea which was a high quality blend of teas from Africa, Assam and Ceylon, it was a bold and brisk, full bodied tea with a smooth and even flavor. My only issue since Lovejoy's prides itself on using a wide array of porcelain serving ware, my cup was way too large for a traditional tea steeper and promptly kept falling into the cup! Oh well I guess the tea leaves just made my drink stronger and therefore only taste better!\n\nWe were so enthralled by the food we wanted to try a couple more items after we feasted on our high tea meal. So we went with a chicken apple walnut sandwich and since our day was not all about cold mini sandwiches a my friend really wanted to sample some of Lovejoy's pub fare, so we went with the sausage rolls which were puff pastries with a sausage filling. The rolls were decent tasting, nothing truly spectacular here, as once again the sandwich was a highlight when sampled with tea. And what a wonderful tea it was, perfect with milk and sugar, they kept our tea pot filled with plenty of water as we drank all afternoon long. Just be forewarned they charge two extra dollars to split a pot.\n\nI really love Lovejoy's with its interior filled with British inspired kitsch and wide variety of traditional teas and sandwiches. When the place isn't packed with customers, it is the perfect place to sit down and relax and contemplate life in a comfortable environment. You can check your cell phone from time to time, but this is a place to enjoy the tranquil beauty of stillness or actually converse with your drinking mate so to speak, so what people tend to do in a traditional coffee shop is a no-no, as well it should be. In the end, our bill literally came out to twenty dollars for each of us which when you come to think of how much food we ate and how much tea we drank is a pretty good deal.

I had imagined it to be two stories for some reason, and it's a little smaller than I expected, but the decor is so beautiful, charming, and quirky, like straight out of a Victorian storybook with a modern touch (mismatched tea cups, saucers, teapots, and plates).\n\nMy friend and I had Queen's Tea. I didn't see it offered on their Yelp menu, but on their menu at the table, it was listed. It's an awesome deal and can certainly be split between two people, along with add-ons (extra scones or petit fours) without it being too pricey. (I looked at the High Tea option. If we had chosen that, and then had extras, it would have costed more than the Queen's Tea with extra). Scones, fruits, salads, crumpet, YUM!\n\nFor tea, we got China Rose Petal. It's as delicious and beautiful as it sounds. The staff and waiters were so friendly and courteous, and were very kind to help me and my friend get photos of us even though they were closing up at 6:00 (my friend and I had a 4:30 reservation).\n\nI really recommend everyone who has appreciation for tea and Victorian aesthetics/culture to visit this place. What a gem! You just have to drive over a bunch of crazy narrow streets and scary steep San Francisco hills.\n\nMy sole critique would be reservation. At the time of this review, only phone reservations are accepted, and I booked between a month to 2 weeks in advance, with the option of 11:00 AM or 4:30 PM on the day my friend and I wanted to come here. I would have liked to reserve online for simplicity's sake, and also not to have to play phone tag with staff (nothing wrong on their end. I left a message, and they called back when I was luckily not busy).\n\nI'll be back here!

This was a filling afternoon snack shared amongst 5 of us. They bring out sandwiches, salads, scones, tea biscuits, and fruits first. The crumpets come next so they're warm and fresh. Last they bring around the tray of petit fours. \n\nTHE SERVICE: Great. Even though the staff all look very hipster (read: tattoos, funky hair colors, piercings) and maybe could've fit in better in a coffee shop on Valencia, they all embraced their floral aprons and seemed to enjoy every minute of their jobs as much as the customers.

A light sweetness that still mixed well with the herbal flavors of a tea.\nVanilla Rooibos - more sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.\nWhite Peach - fruity and light.\n\nTEA SANDWICHES\nBest: Pear & Stilton by far! The intense blue cheese paired incredibly well with the sweet pear.\n\nEverything else was quote bland and \"safe\":\nMediocre: Daily Special (roast beef & mustard), Chicken Apple Walnut Salad (though \nToo plain for me: Cucumber & Cream Cheese, Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese, Salmon Mousse\n\n* Organic Spring Greens, Cabbage Salad in a Caraway Cream Dressing - 3 stars\nPretty simple, the only accent flavor being little mandarin orange slices, and there wasn't quite enough of that. The dressing seemed like a balsamic vinaigrette and the sharpness of that complemented the greens and the orange pretty well. I did wish the salad was colder; it seemed room temp, even warm later on.\n\n* Fresh Fruit - 3 stars\nPretty, but not much beyond that. The winter melon was not ripe and a bit hard. Strawberries, blackberries, and kiwi were nice. \n\n* Petit Four - 4 stars\nfull platter: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#JSpHOzIStSs32UFby1oYIw\ncross-section of our choices: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#k3_KeW_0tv5f41UvRFRtJw\nWe got a dark chocolate/lemon, as well as a rosewater. The chocolate one wasn't great, the jelly-like lemon filling not as sharp as I'd hoped. The rose-water soaked bread-like filling of the other one was great, and we all liked that one much more.\n\n* Tea Biscuit - 3 stars\nNot much here, like those generic hard, buttery Italian cookies. \n\n* Crumpet with Lemon Curd - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#Fj33P7RuOhTOwxyb5OtVJQ\nLIke an English Muffin, but a little more dense, not so airy/fluffy.

Samouvar is not really the same type of place, so no comparison.  I have not been to Crumpet.\n\nSo really, Dartealing and LoveJoy are my top 2 recommended afternoon tea in SF.

My favorites were the buttery, delicate scones, crumpets, and the smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwiches. They were heavenly when paired with the tea.

The tea room is only open Wednesdays to Sundays until 6PM. Last feeding (their words not mine) is at 4:30PM. I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially on the weekends just so you secure yourself a spot in this quaint and cozy little tearoom. You can reserve up to 2 hours in advanced if you're not quite sure of your schedule until the day of. They usually don't pick up, so make sure you leave a message & they'll return your call right away. \n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at this cute little table by the window and on the table, there was a sign that said \"reserved for royalty\". I know at one point I wanted to marry Prince William, but that hardly makes me royal. Regardless, that made me feel very special. The tearoom is small, probably fitting only about 7-10 tables tops. But I think this creates a very intimate experience. Our waitress was very attentive and I felt like she was able to get us everything we needed, which was probably because the space accommodated a handful of people (a plus!).

Not my favorite part of the meal.\n\n- I learned, finally, how to eat scones properly. And have a proper scone. Which aren't the scones from Starbucks, or wherever you get them. These scones are large and studded with blueberries and are warm, not flaky, like you'd think a biscuit sort of thing should be, but are meant to be cut down the middle, like a bagel, and spread with Devon cream (which isn't normal butter -- it's thicker and whipped and DELICIOUS) and then preserves. Amazing! Absolutely delightful. I'll never have a Starbucks scone again. \n\n- Crumpets. Oh my god. I don't even know what to say about these. There aren't American corollaries, but think of a biscuit, but not flakey. In fact, holey. And warm. And delicious.

We were crammed into pretty tight quarters, with very little room for our seats, as well as on the table -- we had to constantly move things around to find places to put everything, and it was almost impossible to do anything without elbowing people from my group on either side. They even had to basically rush us and kick us out at the end, which I suppose is necessary -- at least they were very nice about it.

They slice it into quarters, so there were 16 quarters in total.\n\nSavory:\n-roast beef and horseradish: This had a nice zing to it provided by the horseradish, \n-chicken apple walnut: This probably had the most filling-to-bread ratio and it tasted like the chicken apple salad that they sell at Costco, which I actually liked\n-smoked salmon and cream: Salmon tasted fresh and this was our favorite\n-pear and stilton: your standard sharp tasting stilton\n\nSweets:\nThe scones were more like biscuits with raisins and I prefer more buttery scones, but props to them for still being somewhat warm when they came out even if they were a little dry. It was served with Devonshire cream and preserves and those were definitely done right!\n\nThe shortbread tea biscuits were surprisingly decent tasting. \nWe got the Italian wedding cake and a chocolate apricot petit four a la carte.

I do prefer somewhere that has some finesse, while still keeping the Grandma and girly vibe like Lisa's Tea Treasures,  but this is more a matter of taste preference, so it didn't impact my rating. What did MATTER was the tables were cramped and quite close to each other, making it difficult to go to the bathroom. We could also hear a lot of different conversations. I would prefer more private tables with wider spacing, so I could just relax, but that's just not feasible in a small and popular place. I saw a bridal shower and I felt as if I would want a private room or alcove with less tables if I were them, which is offered in some tea places. The mismatched teapots/cups/strainers resulted in my friend getting a tea strainer that was not wide enough to place on her huge cup, so she had to do a switch-a-roo.\n\nService: The ladies offered to take a picture for us and were quite prolific in topping off our tea with more water. After some time, it seemed like they were a little too hasty in trying to take our food away before we finished, but nothing super offensive.

This was pretty good. They gave us a light vinaigrette dressing for it. NOMS. \n\nColeslaw. It was alright, I'm usually not too big of a fan of coleslaw but this was pretty good, though I'd prefer it drenched in dressing. \n\nOur Choice of Sandwiches:\n\nRoast Beef and Horseradish. This was pretty good, I liked how they offered horseradish instead of typical dijon mustard. The horseradish gave it more spice and brought out the flavors of the beef better.\n\nBay Shrimp and Mayonnaise. This was my favorite by far, it tasted really fresh and delish. The tanginess of the mayonnaise definitely enhanced the fresh taste of the shrimp and hid the oceany taste. \n\nSmoked Salmon and Cream Cheese. This was pretty good as well, just like my favorite lox and cream cheese sans bagel!\n\nChicken Apple Walnut Salad. My least favorite sandwich, mostly because I'm not really a fan of mushy salady sandwiches unless it's amazing and amazing this was not. It was just okay, nothing to write home about really. \n\n(Upper Level)\n\nScones with Strawberry Jam. These were alright, I think the scones at The Rotunda were better. These weren't buttery enough and were more dry. \n\nShortbread Cookies. Didn't taste these because my friend ended up bringing them home. \n\n(Not Shown)\n\nPetit Fours. Didn't actually try these unfortunately because we were THAT full. We couldn't stuff anymore in our stomachs!\n\nOverall, I thought it was a good amount of food for my money.

I normally dump ridiculous amounts of sugar in any tea I encounter but found myself enjoying both the Chinese Rose Petal and Vanilla Rooibos straight on their flavor alone.

We wondered what they did with all the cut-off crusts at the end of the day. \n\nOf the vegetarian options, the egg and onion sandwiches were quite good. Cream cheese is pretty much good in anything (wontons, sushi, frosting); paired with Mandarin oranges or sliced cucumber is no exception. The pear and Stilton (English blue cheese) combination, though interesting, did not taste particularly good. Our sandwiches were served with a delicious spring green salad in addition to large warm scones, preserves, and Double Devon Cream (which I thought was whipped butter).

The ambiance lent itself well to feeling cheerful and relaxed and the tea itself was exceptional. It seemed a bit pricey for such dainty fare...

The hostess was nice enough to help me switch out the tea even though they made a point that they normally don't after they have brewed it. The Genmai http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=pOcaHOwOkJQRQSUJVsx19A was light and ricey. Kinda like the ones from Japanese and Korean restaurants. The sandwiches were pretty good. I especially liked the salmon and cream cheese sandwich as well as the mandarin orange and cream cheese was really refreshing. The crumpet http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=9KKmlGQB8rVk3Sc3ypRWOg looked like a sponge to me but was also good. The scones were really filling.\n\n[M] The Black Current black tea has a nice fruity aroma but doesn't taste as it smells. It was a bit strong and bitter and needed some water to tone down the flavor. My favorite tea selection at Lovejoy's is the China Rose Petal Black Tea and Strawberry Green Tea. The hostess recommended us the Chestnut tea. Perhaps we will try that next time. \n\n[W] Overall experience was nice. I didn't feel out of place since to my surprise, there were quite a lot of men in there. I always imagined tea parties were for \"girly-girls\" but Mona totally proved me wrong.

Something about sitting around a wooden table with a lace tablecloth, or antique-style sofa with a few friends and a nice pot of tea really resonates within me. One would think I feel like a pretentious bourgeois snob, and I am not hypocritical enough to deny it; however, just let it be known that being San Franciscan automatically ingrained a bit of elitism in me. That being said, Lovejoy's Tea Room was not the first time I've taken afternoon tea, and it certainly won't be my last.\n\nWe came to Lovejoy's for my friend's birthday and hoped that we did not miss our stop while riding the J-line. The exterior did not impress me, but the moment we stepped inside, it was as if we were transported into another world. In contrast to the brightness and cuteness of Crown & Crumpet, Lovejoy's interior looked antique and mismatched and absolutely lovely. The cups and plates were all unique and pretty. Of the three tea rooms I've been to thus far, the interior design of Lovejoy's is my favorite by far. \n\nLuckily for us, it was a slow Friday afternoon and we were immediately seated, despite our lack of a reservation. Score! In preparation for documenting my friend's birthday, I brought my camera so I ended up obnoxiously taking pictures of the interior. We made our order, of High Tea for four and the Queen's Tea for the birthday girl.\n\nFood was mediocre. Honestly, the best thing about the food they gave us was the dressing for the salad. I got the smoked salmon with cream cheese, and Lovejoy's special, which was chicken and pesto. Both were unimpressive and was much too creamy. The Devon Cream made me feel as if I were eating butter. I've had better scones elsewhere. The strawberry preserves they gave us was definitely not homemade, and reminded me of smuckers (didn't even spring for Bonne Maman!), and the lemon curd was not tart enough.\n\nBut the tea was fantastic! I loved the pomegranate green, and the China Rose Petal tea was a perfect sweetness (this is from someone who does not like herbal teas). Those were my favorites of the five we order. The waitress was also really nice.\n\nUsually, I'd give three stars for mediocre food, but the decorum, service, and company made the entire experience much more enjoyable than the food.

My girlfriend from high school was visiting from out of town and we had been talking about having high tea.  After much searching and disappointment that The Four Seasons Hotels and the Ritz-Carlton Hotels have discontinued their tea service, we found this place on Yelp.\n\nWe were half an hour late (boyfriends are slow) but lucky one person in our party was only 5 minutes late and saved the table for us.  She said they were very nice and didn't harass her about the rest of her party not showing up.\n\nI had the Queen's Tea with English Breakfast tea and cucumber and turkey sandwiches.  The tea arrived first and after waiting anxiously for it to seep, I poured myself a cup.  It was delicious, but I am not a tea connoisseur.  Then arrived the food, on a three tiered platter.  The top tier was the fresh fruit, next the scone, biscuit, jam, lemon stuff, and the devon cream, the bottom tier had the sandwiches, cole slaw, and greens.\n\nTo be frank, when I first looked at it I thought they kind of skimped out on the fruit, but I was stuffed by the end of my meal, so really they are smarter than me!\n\nAfter having some fruit, I decided to try the scone.  I first tried the devon cream...and that is when I realized that I loved this place!  If I had a lover, forget the whipped cream or chocolate sauce, this is what I'd cover his body with and lick off!!!  I could not get enough of it and I think this was my favorite item here.  Of course the jam and lemon stuff was good too, but I cannot describe my devotion to devon cream now.\n\nThe sandwiches were of course delicious and...dainty, delicate?  FUN!  I am not a super girlie girl.  My friend and I decided to put dresses on for the special occasion and I felt like a streetwalker even though my dress is conservative, but that is how rarely I wear things that don't have legs.  But this place played into my feminine side without me feeling awkward about it.  So yes, it's frilly and kitsch, but it works for this place.\n\nA little while later came my fresh crumpet.  We decided crumpets are a pancake-english muffin hybrid, a puffin. Delicious, but I just wanted to get back to my scone and devon cream to be honest.\n\nLastly when we were done, we had our petite fours.  Which apparently I didn't really experience because I got the dark chocolate truffle with dried apricot.  But it was so cute and I love dark chocolate.  Petite fours are candy-sized, individually glazed pieces of cake.

Ok, so Lovejoys has far more doilies than a man should volunteer to be around, but the Queen's tea is outstanding enough to get me to turn in my man-card for an afternoon of finger sandwiches every time.  \n\nMen this is how it works when you get the Queen's tea (my recommendation).  First, you get an endless pot of tea (which means I drink several pots without realizing it and spend the rest of the day peeing) and choice of a pair of finger sandwich flavors.   I like egg and onion and pear and gorgonzola the best, but I've had almost every flavor and they are great (although the shrimp one is a bit cat-foody).  The sandwiches come cut in little triangles, but you get a bunch of them so it's satisfying and delicious.  This is all served on a three tiered silver platter/tower, in which the top tier is covered in fruits and the second tier is where the real goodness hides.  Tier two has the warm scones (soft, hot and with raisins) on which you have the option of spreading clotted cream (think super-thick whipped cream), lemon curd (FANTASTIC), and/or fresh berry preserves (highly recommended to combine with the clotted cream).  There are also shortbread cookies in case your heart needed more butter and sugar.  The sandwiches are on their three, along with salad greens and some dressing.  \n\nWhile you scarf up this bounty, over extend your bladder, and whittle away at your manhood, the waitstaff will come by to give you warm crumpets.  Crumpets serve as another vessel for the toppings on tier two.  At this point in your meal when you should be wrestling with, \"I'm a man, I had high tea, I'm full, I think like being fancy... this is so confusing,\" the waitstaff will come out with petit-fours as a knockout blow.  Think bite sized cake.\n\nTo survive Lovejoys use my trick to maintaining the illusion of masculinity: take the women in your life here to celebrate their live events / hollidays.

I usually go to Tranquitea in Pacifica and have experienced a NZ teatime. My thoughts:\n\nPros:\n-TEA SANDWICHES & SCONES. Lovejoy's has an excellent assortment of tea sandwiches. You get to choose from 16 delectable little sandwiches, of which I enjoyed the Chicken-Apple-Walnut and the Chicken & Asparagus. High Tea for Two is an awesome deal.\n\nCons:\n-LACK OF GENUINE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My mom went in to get a table while I found parking. Even though they had four women working, I wasn't greeted at the door and we were only asked how our meal was right at the beginning (when we barely took bites of our food). They topped of my tea without asking if I wanted it topped off (my idea of being wasteful). When the woman served us Petits Fours at the end of our meal, she picked the dessert up w/ the tongs and put it on my dirty lunch plate. Oh, and the Petits Fours were warm.\n-PASTRIES. I've had meatpies overseas, and I really did not enjoy the meatpie here. I ordered the Curried Chicken, and it was definitely too spicy to be enjoying with tea. The pastry shell was not flaky and was quite soggy. It reminded me of one of those microwave pastry deals, but worse.\n-AMBIENCE. The set-up was very cute; however, it did need some tidying up. Our tablecloth was stained with food and the place seemed like it needed some dusting. The area that had tea cups, teas, and collectibles for sale was a bit disorganized. This area drastically needed some cleaning up. Although some might appreciated the mismatched tea sets, I did not.\n\nAlthough Lovejoy's has a nice assortment of teas, it wasn't anything that you wouldn't find at any other tea room.\n\nOverall, Lovejoy's was not the pleasant little tea room that I envisioned it to be. I didn't feel like I was truly having High Tea and felt more like I was eating in a San Francisco diner.\n\nDON'T BOTHER GOING HERE.\n\nMy recommendation: Tranquilitea in Pacifica.

It's strange because I don't think Lovejoy's is superior to its competitors in any of the areas I judge a British tea room on, and usually that has to be the case to warrant 5 stars from me. However, sometimes things are greater than the sum of their parts and my overall experience at Lovejoy's was five-star.\n\nDecor and Ambience: Like many British tea rooms, Lovejoy's is dotted throughout with fancy, antique teaware. The quaint setting is accented with old photos and Christmas lights. There's ample seating, although reservations are a must and the seating can accomodate parties large and small. Expect a pleasant buzz of chatter at all hours of operation\n\nTeaware: The saucers, cups and strainers have lovely Victorian designs with Mid-Century modern materials. The tea trays were a little disappointing--dull and metal\n\nTea selection: Lovejoy's offers some unique options like vanilla rooibos along with classics like English Breakfast. I didn't find the former very good, but I'd definitely recommend the \"house\" tea, the Tea Room Blend. Overall, I think the menu offers a good selection of British/Western favorites, but those hoping for good Asian options might be disappointed\n\nFood: I found the prices a little high, considering the portion size, but the quality is definitely above average. I got the \"Me Tea\". The smoked salmon and cream cheese tea sandwich came on fluffy white bread and the salmon was moist and delicious. The scone was a little dry, but the accompanying Devonshire cream was plentiful and rich. I saw that Lovejoy's offered pasties and I just had to order a beef one. When I lived in London, I had the most delicious beef pasties and it's been extremely hard for me to find good ones in the US. Lovejoy's had a fantastic filling of flavorful beef and diced carrots with just the right amount of seasoning. The pastry shell was flaky, but the ones I had in England were thicker and crisper. I also tried two petit fours: the strawberry shortcake and the raspberry Victorian wedding cake. We were told the insides were marzipan (which I'm not really a fan of), but they were more like cake. Both were very sweet and delicious, but I think I preferred the strawberry shortcake\n\nService: Fantastic. Friendly, warm, attentive and efficient. All servers knew their menus inside and out, and were clearly passionate about afternoon tea\n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful afternoon chatting with my two Boston girlfriends who had just moved to San Francisco.

Fortunately, I didn't have to worry about that at all, mainly because of their scones, which were really filling. The raisin topped scones came out warm, and while they were flaky and a little dry, adding the devon cream and jam more than made up for that. It was really delicious and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a scone that much before. The salad was fresh. I got the smoked salmon and cheese and the bay shrimp and mayo sandwiches. Both were nice, but I preferred the smoked salmon and cheese. The salmon and cheese really went well together. Ended with the shortbread cookies, which were nothing special, but good enough.

"], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "A great place in a tony San Francisco neighborhood to act as if you are a citizen of Great Britain, thanks to the many options they have here, as you can enjoy a spot of tea as well as the traditional British-inspired dining options that accompanies them, Lovejoy's Tea is great place to kick back and hang out with friends or have a calming moment to one's self. \n\nA friend had been dying to enjoy a traditional tea room in San Francisco and I had sent him a list complied by the website SF.eater.com of the best places to enjoy afternoon or high tea in the city and Lovejoy's was one of their top picks for their unique yet homey ambience with a wide variety of traditional English teas and sandwiches. After doing some reading some reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I knew that Lovejoy's would be the perfect place to enjoy a pot of tea in the city for the very first time. My friend got a reservation for Thursday afternoon at 4pm, which turns out we didn't even need it as it wasn't packed at all at this time of day.\n\nThere are a lot of great options at Lovejoy's for tea and sandwich lovers alike. Since we were newcomers to all of this, we asked our server what she would recommend for two tea lovers who also wanted to try a lot of traditional British goodies and who also wanted to just sit back and take it all in. She suggested we get the High Tea which consisted for our choice of two tea sandwiches served with organic spring greens, cabbage salad in a caraway cream dressing, a warm scone served with preserves and Devon cream and a tea biscuit to boot. At $21.95 for all of that, we felt that that was a very affordable deal. Since she knew we were going to stay a while she suggested we get one more sandwich (at an additional $3.95) to go with this combination to satisfy our taste buds. We agreed and although all of the sandwich options looked plenty good but we knew we had to get the traditional sandwich that pairs perfectly with English tea, cucumber and cream cheese, in addition to the roast beef and horseradish and ham and English mustard options.\n\nServed on a two tiered cake stand, with the scone on top and the sandwiches and salads on the larger bottom tier, everything tasted amazing. I loved the scone especially when spread with the Devon cream and preserves. The sandwiches were so tasty, I especially loved the traditional cucumber sandwich made with real English cucumbers. The horseradish gave the roast beef a real kick, so be wary when biting into them. The sandwiches and salads paired very well with our tea, which was also selected with our server's advice, when we asked what went well with milk, we went with the Yorkshire Gold Black Tea which was a high quality blend of teas from Africa, Assam and Ceylon, it was a bold and brisk, full bodied tea with a smooth and even flavor. My only issue since Lovejoy's prides itself on using a wide array of porcelain serving ware, my cup was way too large for a traditional tea steeper and promptly kept falling into the cup! Oh well I guess the tea leaves just made my drink stronger and therefore only taste better!\n\nWe were so enthralled by the food we wanted to try a couple more items after we feasted on our high tea meal. So we went with a chicken apple walnut sandwich and since our day was not all about cold mini sandwiches a my friend really wanted to sample some of Lovejoy's pub fare, so we went with the sausage rolls which were puff pastries with a sausage filling. The rolls were decent tasting, nothing truly spectacular here, as once again the sandwich was a highlight when sampled with tea. And what a wonderful tea it was, perfect with milk and sugar, they kept our tea pot filled with plenty of water as we drank all afternoon long. Just be forewarned they charge two extra dollars to split a pot.\n\nI really love Lovejoy's with its interior filled with British inspired kitsch and wide variety of traditional teas and sandwiches. When the place isn't packed with customers, it is the perfect place to sit down and relax and contemplate life in a comfortable environment. You can check your cell phone from time to time, but this is a place to enjoy the tranquil beauty of stillness or actually converse with your drinking mate so to speak, so what people tend to do in a traditional coffee shop is a no-no, as well it should be. In the end, our bill literally came out to twenty dollars for each of us which when you come to think of how much food we ate and how much tea we drank is a pretty good deal. I think it actually cost me more to take public transportation to get to the Noe Valley location of Lovejoy's and I can't think of anything more quintessential San Francisco than that!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-10-19"}, {"excerpts": ["As per the suggestion of the server, we ordered the High Tea for one and added an extra scone and 2 extra sandwiches with the Yorkshire Gold Tea.

It's strange because I don't think Lovejoy's is superior to its competitors in any of the areas I judge a British tea room on, and usually that has to be the case to warrant 5 stars from me. However, sometimes things are greater than the sum of their parts and my overall experience at Lovejoy's was five-star.\n\nDecor and Ambience: Like many British tea rooms, Lovejoy's is dotted throughout with fancy, antique teaware. The quaint setting is accented with old photos and Christmas lights. There's ample seating, although reservations are a must and the seating can accomodate parties large and small. Expect a pleasant buzz of chatter at all hours of operation\n\nTeaware: The saucers, cups and strainers have lovely Victorian designs with Mid-Century modern materials. The tea trays were a little disappointing--dull and metal\n\nTea selection: Lovejoy's offers some unique options like vanilla rooibos along with classics like English Breakfast. I didn't find the former very good, but I'd definitely recommend the \"house\" tea, the Tea Room Blend. Overall, I think the menu offers a good selection of British/Western favorites, but those hoping for good Asian options might be disappointed\n\nFood: I found the prices a little high, considering the portion size, but the quality is definitely above average. I got the \"Me Tea\". The smoked salmon and cream cheese tea sandwich came on fluffy white bread and the salmon was moist and delicious. The scone was a little dry, but the accompanying Devonshire cream was plentiful and rich. I saw that Lovejoy's offered pasties and I just had to order a beef one. When I lived in London, I had the most delicious beef pasties and it's been extremely hard for me to find good ones in the US. Lovejoy's had a fantastic filling of flavorful beef and diced carrots with just the right amount of seasoning. The pastry shell was flaky, but the ones I had in England were thicker and crisper. I also tried two petit fours: the strawberry shortcake and the raspberry Victorian wedding cake. We were told the insides were marzipan (which I'm not really a fan of), but they were more like cake. Both were very sweet and delicious, but I think I preferred the strawberry shortcake\n\nService: Fantastic. Friendly, warm, attentive and efficient.

Thank you, Lovejoy's for a very enjoyable Saturday afternoon!", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-06-14"}, {"excerpts": ["And the black currant tea is to die for.\n\n"], "author": "Anna T.", "review": "Lovejoy's Tea Room has really delicious scones.

Hodgepodge furniture squished together, no room to even stick out your pinky finger to drink tea like a snob!  \n\nI understand that they are super busy, so I appreciate them fitting us in the 1 hour opening they had.  But the waitress was kind of strange and didn't provide us with attentive, fast service given that she wanted us to leave ASAP.  \n\nMy friend came in 3 minutes after we placed our initial order so the waitress said she would be right back to take her order.

You can get them in different assortments (Queen's Tea or Ploughman's Lunch, for example), or a la carte, depending on how hungry you are.  \n\nThe staff is extremely nice - I have been there both for a group event, and for an intimate lunch, and both times we were treated very well.

There were groups with mommies and their little girls bouncing around the room, hyped up from all the caffeine and the sweets.  There were tables with mixed genders...and honestly, the guys looked a little awkward and out of place, no matter how much they profess love the yummy little finger sandwiches and warm scones.  It was definitely loud with chatter and laughter, but Michele and I were able to reminisce about old times and catch up each other on new gossip from our lives.  I was just at her wedding in La Jolla a few weeks ago and of course she was so preoccupied then, we hardly had a few moments to talk then.\n\nA perfectly \"delightful\" afternoon!

This time I chose the salmon and cream cheese and chicken and asparagus sandwiches.  Both were pretty tasty, but the asparagus was mushy for me, but otherwise edible.  I probably wouldn't order it again though.  I did try my friend's shrimp and mayo sandwich and that was tasty also.
