Convenient!!\n\nWe ordered a crispy tofu sandwich (for him, of course), a lemongrass pork sandwich + a $1 pate add on (a must try), and fries to share.  This came out to almost $20, which I thought was pretty expensive to begin with.  When these sandwiches were brought to our table, I remember thinking that this better be the BEST Vietnamese sandwich I've ever had in my life because it was TINY.  As a Vietnamese girl from San Jose, I didn't have very high hopes for this place, but it ended up really surprising me.  Don't get me wrong, it was unexpectedly delicious.

Served on a crusty baguette, the chicken thighs were a little dry and the carrot and daikon, the most important part of a bahn mi, were barely pickled. Juicy and delicious, the \"juicy steak bun\" ($8.49) is topped with lotus root relish, shaved onion, pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and crispy shallots and slathered with lime pepper mayonnaise. Unfortunately not sloppy at all, the \"sloppy bun\" ($6.95) with red curry ground beef, garlic mayonnaise, shaved onion, thai basil, and jalape\u00f1os was rather dry.

I arrived at 12:45 PM and the line was 10 people deep, I waited 5 minutes to get to the register and ordered the combo sandwich and salt n' peppa garlic fries.  Then waited another 10 minutes for my order to come out.  It was a quick process, which is something I really appreciate since I usually grab lunch and run back to the office to chow down.\n\n:) Combo Sandwich - it's main ingredients were grilled kurobuta pork and p\u00e2t\u00e9.  First off, the french roll was warm, crunchy and perfect.  I was able to taste the pork with the pate along with all the other ingredients.  And I must say, it was a tasty treat to be able to eat one of these.  5 STARS\n\n:) Salt and Pepper Garlic fries with Jalapenos - It wasn't the salt and pepper that I was expecting because usually there's a batter coating to go with salt and pepper fried food.  So, I wasn't impressed, perhaps the garlic and jalapenos made the fries soggy, I don't like soggy.  I still chomped all of them up but left all the jalapenos behind, those peppers gave it HEAT.  2.5 STARS\n\nThe decor definitely has that designers thoughtful touches that mimic's what a true B\u00e1nh m\u00ec street vendor may look like in the streets of Vietnam.  The shop looks modern and trendy with their gutted out high ceilings.  You can't help but notice the chaotic web of wires that floats on their ceilings and dangles with industrial lighting.  The red poster art on the wall bounces off a modernized vintage propaganda image but at the same time feels friendly communistic and playful.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\n\nOverall, I'm over the top infatuated by Bun Mee.  And I have plans to eat EVERYTHING that's listed on their menu.  Next up on the line-up...five spice chicken sandwich and ice coffee...  If these 2 items hit my palate the same way as the combo sandwich, I'll be theirs forever!\n\nNOTES: Sandwiches are typical FiDi prices of $6.50 and above .

I had just finished drinks with my mom and her friend up the street at Rickhouse when I ran into my friend and we went to grab a quick dinner. We started walking toward the Westfield to check out the vast food court, but then I spotted Bun Mee and remembered I'd been wanting to try it.\n\nOff the bat, it gave me the generic up-and-coming vibe that I have been getting from other Financial Dist eateries (360 Burrito Express, Mixt Greens, Verde, etc) so I was a little turned off.

They were alright, nothing spesh, and odd that there was no garlic to be found.\n\nA large red beam behind the cash register claims that every sandwich is served with jalepenos and if you don't eat them you're sissy (good one) but I asked for extra jalepenos, and was given maybe four slices on my whole sandwich. It's become customary for me to just ask no less than three times for extra jalepenos, which makes me feel like a dick, but whatevs. I will say I appreciate that they have a big bottle of Sriracha on every table so you don't have to run all over the place trying to obtain the spicy sauce.\n\nWill I be back?
