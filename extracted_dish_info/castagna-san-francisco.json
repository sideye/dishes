I am in quest of the perfect Salade Nicoise, (Right now I have to say that The Left Bank in Larkspur has it.) But this one was a little different, and very good. The center  had Arugula heaped up, surounded by the usual Nicoise additions including perfectly cooked green beans, olives, perfect hard-boiled egg, anchovies (the latter two better than Left Bank's), and sliced rounds of rare Ahi.
