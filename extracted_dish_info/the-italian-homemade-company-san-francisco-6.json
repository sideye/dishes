Like 5 PM early.  Grandma status.  I always argue that when you go early, 1) you never have to wait, 2) you get better service, 3) your food doesn't have to sit in your stomach, trying to digest when it's bedtime.\n\nAfter an afternoon of volunteering at the SPCA, Husband and I walked from Pac Heights to The Italian Homemade Company to have a nice hearty pasta dinner.  Though we'd passed by and knew this was open (used to be the American Cupcake Kitchen), we just never had the chance to actually go in.\n\nIt was just before 6 when we walked in, and all the tables were actually full already, but the bar seating (not really a bar, but it overlooks their refrigerator where they store fresh pasta for sale) was empty.  There were a few people ahead of us in line, so that gave us time to peruse the menu.\n\nThe choices are simple: pick a type of pasta (all homemade, including fettucine, tagliatelle, pappardelle, lasagna), then pick a sauce (marinara, bolognese, cream-based etc).  Then if you're sitting there to eat, you pick a spot, and they bring your food out to you.  You can also buy the fresh pasta and pre-packaged sauce to go to cook at home.\n\nAs soon as we ordered and sat at the bar, the line developed, and by the time we were done eating, the line was almost to the door, and it wasn't even 6:30 yet.\n\nWe both went for meatballs (2 + bolognese sauce), and I had the fettucine while Husband got the tagliatelle.  Both plates were piping hot, the noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce was DELICIOUS.. but my meatballs were super tough, dense, hard and dry.\n\nHusband thought his meatballs were fine, so maybe he got a different batch?  I ended up giving mine to him, and he ate it without complaints.  Maybe I'm just used to meatballs that are super tender and fall apart easily (Dobbs Ferry's, for example).\n\nThis place is no doubt one of the best places to get fresh pasta for a decent price in the Marina, if not the city in general.

Unfortunately, they loaded it with pine nuts (yuck) instead of the promised walnuts, but I was able to pick around them, (3) definitely do not miss the burrata salad- mixed green salad topped with a good size chunk of creamy fresh goodness. I asked for dressing on the side since I find places typically put too much for my taste, but the small dishes of oil and vinegar provided were tough to stir into a dressing. No matter, the greens were fresh and though a splash of vinegar would have been great, the salad was actually fine without. I didn't love the flat triangles of bread that came with the salads- we ended up leaving most all of it behind.
