KitTea is a very structured system.  The price of admission ($20 on weekdays, $25 on weekends plus a $1 booking fee if you book online which does not apply if you book over phone or walk in) gets you a 1 hour time slot in the cat lounge with unlimited green tea.  They have an impressive selection probably because they are influenced by the Japanese style cat cafes including Kukicha, Hojichasun, Sencha, and Genmaicha green teas.  They even have ceremonial matcha tea which is extra.   They serve food and other drinks as well.  1 hour for the price seems like a lot but it can get tiring after a while playing with cats non- stop so I think it's worth it.\n\nThere is a 'cat wrangler' in the lounge who make sure everything is in order as well as taking food and drink orders however they cannot technically serve the food since it's goes against health codes because they are working with animals so you pick it up outside the cat lounge.  \nThere are cushions for the cats, shelfs for them to jump on, books about cats, and some toys for guests to engage and play with the cats.  Outside the cat lounge is a little caf\u00e9 where you can go without paying the entrance fee if you just wanted to observe some furry felines.  \n\nOne of the things I randomly loved the best was the warm Japanese style Japanese toilet seats!   I haven't seen one since I was in Japan years ago and that was one of the best things I remembered about being in Japan.\n\nFor me this is 5 stars because I love cats so much!

Two words: Hello Kitty. Besides, they all live in tubes over there or something not much bigger, so the idea of sipping tea and fondling a cat is most appealing to the workaholic and spaceaholic Japanese professional. Now San Francisco has one in Hayes Valley on the ground floor of a modern condo building. I came in on a Saturday at 3PM and found out they were fully booked until 8PM when they close. Hey, no whiskers off my nose since I'm allergic anyway. Did I mention it costs $25 for an hour of heavy petting?\n\nIt's five dollars less on weekdays, and they offer a Happy Meow'r (get it?) for $15 per hour on Thursdays 3-6PM. There are ten to fifteen cats, most less than a year old, who prance around indifferently in a large room with a long wooden bench, pillows, and all sorts of cat toys (photo: http://bit.ly/2nzjDC7). Ain't that precious? I could see them through the window quite easily, though the most entertaining part of the show are the humans who go to great lengths to cajole the cats into purring submission (photo: http://bit.ly/2nKIcwo). I was watching them through a large window on the tea house side where they serve paninis, waffles, soups and salads, and pastries.\n\nMe?
