I enjoyed with soy and extra wasabi on every bite. Very fresh and delicious. Fair pricing for the city as well. I'll definitely drop back in for lunch. Minus one star because they don't offer miso soup during their day hours. To me, sushi just isn't the same without a warm miso.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-10-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The hand roll was to die for!"], "author": "Ayo S.", "review": "Great restaurant.

I particularly love sitting upstairs at the sushi bar where you can see the bar downstairs fill up and come to life. They also have a huge projector downstairs where they showcase calming beach scene videos, which I think is a really fun touch. Overall, the atmosphere is awesome for a casual drink to catch up with friends or to mingle with new people. The music is never too loud so you can actually hold a conversation during HH. \n\nIn terms of drinks, they offer a nice cocktail menu, my personal favorite is the John Colins cocktail. I've also sampled a few of their red wines and have been very pleased. The bar and wait staff are are friendly and super helpful while the prices are affordable. \n\nI go mostly for their sushi, they just opened up the sushi bar upstairs a few months ago and they are always refining the menu. If you like sushi, they have a roll for you. I've gone and had a hand roll as a snack if I was planning on going to dinner later and I've also spent a few hours upstairs to try several rolls on the menu for a full dinner.
