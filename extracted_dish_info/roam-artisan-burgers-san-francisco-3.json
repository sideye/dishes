Tons of people didn't have seats and we had to wait about 20 minutes after ordering before we were able to steal a chair from family who had just finished their meal. I seriously felt horrible, like those creepy guys at clubs eyeing girls to creep on. Except I was a hungry girl eyeing a family hoping to steal a chair from them. Sorry, maybe too weird of an analogy.\n\nI ended up getting the Allegash beer and the beet and quinoa burger (GREAT FOR VEGETARIANS!) with the \"Sunny Side\" style with the fried egg.

Anyway, it was well worth it. Boy is that the best homemade veggie burger I've ever had. The beets add the perfect sweet taste and the quinoa adds your healthy carbs. The egg was perfectly cooked and they have this amazing sauce in which God knows WHAT they put inside but WHO CARES IT WAS SO GOOD. \n\nOur fries were perfectly cooked and delicious (though I could have done without the regular fries and the zucchini and onion strings which just kind of tasted like fried.....something). My favorite was the sweet potato fries.\n\nLastly, the beer. What is a burger without beer?! The Allegash was their most popular beer apparently and is a lighter beer perfect to go along with a lighter burger! Great!\n\nPros: AWESOME BURGERS! They have grass-fed meat everything including BISON! They have turkey instead of chicken which comes from the Dietsel Farms. Great way to get a healthy-ish burger that still tastes great! \n\nCons: Can be crowded so you should be willing to wait. Very VERY dim lighting.

They're very accommodating to large groups, helping to seat around twenty people on my friend's birthday, but I wouldn't recommend doing that on the regular. The tables are more suited to fit smaller groups of four or less. \n\nAll the burgers are solid with my favorites being the french and fries and the sunny side. The fry-fecta is good, but I suggest sharing it among friends. The burgers are filling so you might not be able to finish everything yourself.\n\nThe shakes are pricey considering the size but so delicious.
