Let me start by saying I'm a bit of a dumpling snob. I can be quite particular when it comes to these delicate little savory balls of dough. That said, I was incredibly pleased with this batch of NumNum! \n\nFirst up were the go-to\u00a0Xiao Long Bao... For all you non-dumpling eating peasants, these are more commonly called Soup Dumplings. Why? Because they are dumplings that literally have soup inside of them. Duh. These were delicious! Perfect ratio of soup to skin (STS as I like to call it), perfect balance of flavor, and they came with a \"soy-based with a bit of spicy\" sauce that I poured over top (after piercing each with the chopstick to ensure perfect penetration of flavor). I have to say, they could have been hotter, but considering I ordered delivery I'm not mad. At all.\u00a0\nNext up were the Seafood Gyoza with Spiced Chili Butter. These little gems of the sea must be what Ariel would get on special occasions, because they were fu**ing DELICIOUS. The green spinach wrappers did the job of making me feel like I was still being healthy... The inside was a harmonious and delectable mix of crab, shrimp, scallop, and cilantro. Once again the STS was perfect (in this case, stuffing, not soup). They came with two sauces, one of which was a basic gyoza sauce but the other was this amazing slightly spicy creamy butter sauce. These things were so good that even non seafood eaters would love them! Ok, I'm not sure about that because I wouldn't share with anyone who asked to try them... But I would bet so!\n\nLast sample of the evening were the Maine Lobster Siu Mai. Holy S**t. Have you ever traveled to Portland? (Maine, not Oregon). Well, if you have, you know that near the wharf there are several little amazing lobster shacks, and as soon as you step anywhere near them, you can practically taste the deliciousness of the fresh crustacean in the air. Now, imagine being able to bottle up that intensity and compact it into a bite sized gem of steamed dough with chives, butter, and white truffle oil. That's exactly what these bad boys tasted like. Amazing. They did not require any sauce, but myself being a Saucy Sam, tried at least one with each of the previously mentioned sauces, and I would be lying if I said it did not make them even better. \n\nAll in all, I ate 15 dumplings. 6 soup dumplings, 4 lobster sui may, and 5 gyoza. I could have EASILY eaten double that. Partly because I'm fat and eat too much, partly because when something is so delicious I just want to keep eating it far after I am full, but also because these bad boys are a little bit on the small side as far as dumplings go... My suggestion? Order quite a bit more than you would normally think you want, you will NOT be disappointed. And I forgot to mention... They also gave me this side of pickled Lotus and Carrot. Never had Lotus before, it was delicious.   \n\nI cannot wait to go to this place and literally order everything off the menu. Oh damn!

Good music, neon lights, and Kpop MV play on the projector giving the place a karaoke/lounge nightlife feel.\n\nPork Xiao Long Bao - different from the traditionally made XLB that's served on top of napa cabbage in a steam basket, these are individually placed in aluminum cups.

Love the contrast of the soft, fluffy bao to the slightly crisp and roasted flavor from the searing. The chicken mixture is juicy, tender and delicious! You get 3 baos per order.\n\nTrio of Buns - a happy ending to any meal here, a trio of sweet steamed buns. Green Tea with Milk filling, Beet and Taro filling and Egg Yolk Bun. The buns are light, fluffy and come out steaming hot. Fillings are lightly sweetened and the perfect texture, a bit gelled and custard-like. Didn't know which one I liked more, but I can't stray from a good classic ... so the Egg Yolk did me in.

There's 3 different colored buns with either custard or milk filling inside. The green one has a green tea flavored bun. We were too full to try the red one to see how the bun tasted.

We scored parking in one of the few spots directly in front of the door. The restaurant has a nice outdoor patio that's covered. The restaurant  had someone with a clipboard come out at 11:02 to take our names and party size and went back inside. I didn't really see the point of taking down our names and party size if the restaurant wasn't even open?? And there were only 2 parties in line at that moment hahaha. Well, whatever. We were seated once my name was called. I've recently dined at Din Tai Fung, so I'm apologizing in advance because my comparisons seemed to be automatic.\n\nAs first timers we ordered\nStarters:\n-garlicky green beans: garlicky green beans are always a good idea. but they weren't perfectly blanched\n-shrimp toast: not sure what they use as the \"toast\" part but i really enjoyed this item\n\nSmall Bites:\n-cucumber salad: the cucumbers didn't have any peel and were sliced lengthwise. I prefer the cucumbers not sliced lengthwise and prefer the peel\n\nHar Gow (steamed dumplings):\n-shrimp : this has cream cheese but I could barely taste it\n-shrimp & cilantro: i'm not big on cilantro and will only eat it when necessary. the combo of shrimp and cilantro with the paired cilantro dipping sauce was complementing\n\nNoodles: \n-beijing noodles: a tad bit bland but my son loves noodles and still loved it\n\nGyoza (pan crisped dumplings):\n-chicken: filled with a lot of meat and the dumpling wrapped itself wasn't so thick. i think it maybe drizzled with a little spice (orange flakes on the picture) just fyi if you have kids. my son grabbed it so fast and licked the flakes and said \"spicy\" \n\nXLB (soup dumplings):\n-king dum: instagram worthy for $8 \n-pork xlb\n-tom yum goong: red colored because of the beet wrapper\nI LOVE XLB and these actually tasted good. BUT.... what I didn't like at all was that the XLB was lined with an aluminum liner. So actually, the bottom of the dumplings stuck to the liner! This made eating it soooo messy. We tried so many ways to remove the liner and even if you try to peel the liner off first instead of making a hole at the top , pulling the liner can create a hole and the soup spills from the bottom! I like eating XLB by putting it directly into the spoon. Isn't it supposed to be that way?? This was a big no no for me especially since XLB was my favorite and we ordered a lot of it. We got tired of making such a mess we just got over it and took it home. The left over XLB (we took home) didn't stick to the liners I guess because it was cold already.\n\nAnd why is their plates soo small? It was literally just a little bigger than a teacup saucer but it was square shaped. The green beans barely fit the length of the plate. Fyi soda is served by the can. \n\nI wish they had chocolate XLB like DTF. That probably would've made me give them another star.\n\nI enjoyed the food here and would dine here again only when they get rid of the aluminum liners for the XLB but I noticed that the staff serving you here aren't as knowledgeable as the staff as DTF. Example, as we were packing our food, we asked the waitress to get \"extra of this sauce\" (& was holding up the actual sauce to show her) and her response was \"Which one is that?\" Uhhh. YOU tell me which one that is. It's not even like there was barely any sauce left to tell what it was!\n\nOh and on this note I have to mention something about the bust boy or whatever their title is -- the ones who just clean up your dirty dishes!! He comes to our table to remove some dishes & I politely ask for napkins. I don't have an accent either. He nods his head and says \"Ok.\" But then the waitress comes over and says \"He said you needed something?\" Uhh. Why can't he get me the napkin. Or why can't he tell her it is a \"napkin\"? Later on,  I asked him for \"a FORK for my son please\". He again nods his head and says \"Ok.\" I was watching him and AGAIN, he tells our waitress to come to our table. With my own eyes I see that he doesn't tell her I need a \"fork\". That's weird to me. Unless it's a rule that he can't get the table anything and it must be a Waitress to do it???

The shrimp toast was essentially shrimp on top of a chinese doughnut served with a spicy mayo sauce. It was good, but I don't think I will order it again. The pork gyoza was the biggest disappointment of the night. There was nothing special about it and the sauce it came with was extremely salty. You will regret ordering it. I don't really like char-siu baos, but lef bf wanted it. He said it was really, really good. He is a bbq pork bun connoisseur. The shrimp har gow would make my ancestors roll in their graves as it had cream cheese in it. It tasted good, and I really like how there were large chunks of shrimp in it. I also really liked the shrimp and cilantro ones. The sauce it came with was quite good, but at the end of the day, I still like it served with the dim sum red vinegar (which you can request). The pork XLB were better than I expected. For the price, and the amount of soup and flavor you get, we will definitely be back for these. Le bf liked these better than Din Tai Fung. He said that he could go to Dumpling Time versus having to drive all the way down to the South Bay for Din Tai Fung. \n\nPro tip: Ask to keep the lid for the XLB steamer box. That way, you can keep your XLB nice and warm and you aren't in this huge rush to eat them before they get cold. Cold XLB = a no no. \n\nFrom the point we ordered to the point we asked for the check, we ate a full meal in under 35 minutes. WOW! And this isn't even considered fast food.

While both were filled with savory soups, we preferred the pork XLB over the tom yum goong XLB since it had less of a vinegry taste to it. The tom yum XLB wasn't spicy or sour like the soup usually is. Topped with meat and some ginger, the Beijing noodles were also pretty delicious, but it was definitely not enough to share for the 3 of us. We ended with the trio of happy ending buns- matcha and milk, egg yolk, and beet and taro bun. Of the 3 type of buns, the matcha and milk was our favorite, having a familiar custard-y, milky taste to it. \n\n- THE WAIT\nDO NOT go on a weekend unless you know that are first in line. We arrived on a Saturday around 12:30 PM and we waited until 1:58 PM to be seated (it closes at 2:00 PM). Our food took a while to get out since there was still a lot of people waiting for their food.  We were starving and cranky, making us feel that this trip to Dumpling Time wasn't worth it. \n\n- THE PRICES\nThe prices here are pretty steep, considering typical Chinese food isn't very expensive. However, this is more of an Americanized Chinese place and every plate is nearly $10 for just a few pieces. Although the food is pretty good, I felt that the wait and the prices weren't all worth it.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-07-11"}], "chicken bao": [{"excerpts": ["Chicken Bao (Seared) ", "- ", "Steamed bao filled with chicken, green onion, mushroom and ginger mixture and seared.

Beautifully presented and equally delicious!\n\nDecently sized restaurant with a fun vibe and entertaining where you can watch the kitchen staff prepare dumplings from a window- just like Din Tai Fung. Good music, neon lights, and Kpop MV play on the projector giving the place a karaoke/lounge nightlife feel.\n\nPork Xiao Long Bao - different from the traditionally made XLB that's served on top of napa cabbage in a steam basket, these are individually placed in aluminum cups. A bit small, but still soupy with a good morsel of minced pork mixture on the inside. Delicious with ginger, black vinegar and soy dipping sauce. An order comes with 6 dumplings.\n \nSiu Mai (Shrimp & Pork) - Ground pork with shrimp encased in a wonton, fatty pork was nice and tender. Big chunks of shrimp, sweet and not fishy and the exterior of the wrapper was soft and thin. Often found Siu Mai to be rubbery and chewy at most places, but it's just right here!\n\nGarlicky Green Beans - Sauteed green beans in garlic and garnished with edible flowers. Perfectly cooked beans with just enough bite, yummy garlic, and sesame flavor. Good veggie dish to share.\n\nHar Gow - shrimp encased in a rice flour wrapper and steamed, nice chunks of shrimp but found the wrapper on this dumpling too tasteless and left more to be desired.\n\nChicken Bao (Seared) - Steamed bao filled with chicken, green onion, mushroom and ginger mixture and seared. Love the contrast of the soft, fluffy bao to the slightly crisp and roasted flavor from the searing. The chicken mixture is juicy, tender and delicious! You get 3 baos per order.\n\nTrio of Buns - a happy ending to any meal here, a trio of sweet steamed buns. Green Tea with Milk filling, Beet and Taro filling and Egg Yolk Bun. The buns are light, fluffy and come out steaming hot. Fillings are lightly sweetened and the perfect texture, a bit gelled and custard-like. Didn't know which one I liked more, but I can't stray from a good classic ... so the Egg Yolk did me in. It wasn't the best sweet steamed buns I've had but they were good!\n\nService is always on point here. Food always comes out quickly and piping hot.

Still-crisp Garlicky Green Beans were on par with others restaurants & not overly sauced. \n\nI liked the Cilantro & Shrimp Har Gow a little less than the Shrimp version; the twist is there is cream cheese & pork in these steamed dumplings. Shrimp Toast, a Chinese donut with minced shrimp & spicy aioli, was addictive. Steamed Chicken Bao were amongst the best tasting I've had.

Not the most amazing, best dumplings I've ever had in my life, but it's pretty good.  Came 11:30am on a Sunday and got seats 10 min after signing in.\n\nVenue / Service: clean and bright on the inside, though it does feel cramped.  We sat nearby the kitchen and the servers were moving so quickly past each other that some glassware fell and broke. The kitchen is open so you get to see them making the dumplings which is cool to watch!  \n\nFood: it's pretty much all about the dumplings, so be prepared to carb-load a bit!  Would probably limit the number of baos if you don't wanna get full too quickly.\n-- CHICKEN BAO seared (Chicken, green onion, mushroom, ginger)(3pcs/$6) - decent amount of filling inside vs. wrapper, and it was quite tasty!  Love the green onion and ginger to brighten up the otherwise heavy filling.  \n\n-- PORK XLB (pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine)(6pcs/$8.50) - hard to go wrong with XLBs but these were quite good.  The wrapper is super thin, so be careful of breaking them when you are trying to take them out of the container.  Soup was nice and light yet savory, and the pork had a nice texture.  \n\n-- KING-DUM (1pc/$9) - pretty much is the equivalent of 6 of the smaller XLBs.  The wrapper is quite thick, unlike the regular XLBs and you have to poke a hole in it with your straw so that the filling / soup inside will cool (which took quite a while).  There's a LOT of filling so keep this in mind if you are ordering other dishes.  Overall, I think I preferred the smaller XLBs in terms of easiness to eat, but it's a fun dish to try.  \n\n-- Three-sum dessert buns (green tea / milk, beet / taro, and egg yolk)(3pcs/$6) - our favorite was the egg yolk flavor-wise, though the beet taro combo was an interesting one.  The green-tea / milk one was slightly on the sweeter side for us, but appreciated how these had a decent amount of filling vs. the wrapper.  \n\nAll in all, this isn't the absolute best dumplings I've had, but they are higher on my list.  Would recommend for first timers with XLBs and those who want a photo op with a huge dumpling.

I have been wanting to try something new and came across Dumpling Time during one of my yelp searches. Come early! We arrived at Dumping Time around 1030am and there was already two groups ahead of us. When you arrive, you can see that the workers at Dumpling Time are busy getting the restaurant ready for opening. You can see the chefs working nonstop making the dim sum items. They already have the list out for you to write your names on, which is great. \n\nDumpling Time started seating people promptly at 1100am.

They didn't seem super busy on a Saturday morning. They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. You will be able to to choose as long as there is both options available for you. They will also ask you if your whole party is present. \n\nWe got a few things to try! We got their shrimp toast, char-sui bao, chicken bao, xiao long bao, tom yum goong, pork xian dumpling, and their trio of buns. \n\nTheir shrimp toast was really delicious! It's pretty much a Chinese donut with shrimp paste on top. I thought they did this dish really well. I couldn't really taste the shrimp but the Chinese donut part is very savory. It had just the right amount of crunch and the aroma of it was so yummy. \n\nTheir char-sui bao and chicken baos have the option of them steaming it or pan searing it. We got both with a pan sear and it gave it a nice crispy textured to the sides. The dough that they used for their bao was very good -- very soft. It was probably my favorite part of the baos. As for the inside, they're pretty normal to me. They should just have a dish of just plain pan seared baos .. I would totally order that! \n\nTheir xiao long bao and tom yum goong were pretty similar in taste. The only difference was that the tom yum goong had a little bit of spice to them. But other than that, they're about the same. I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if their wrappings weren't different. Both were pretty good. All of them were really juicy and none of our dumplings popped prior to reaching us! \n\nTheir pork xian dumplings weren't that great. To me, they were quite bland even with the sauce that they provided. I had to use chili oil to give it some flavor haha! \n\nTheir trio of buns were our dessert! It consisted of green tea and milk bun, egg yolk bun, and beet and taro bun. The egg yolk bun had an egg custard like filling inside and was the sweetest of the three. The green tea and milk bun had a very delicious aroma and was not too sweet at all. The beet and taro bun was yummy as well -- also not as sweet. I think my favorite was the green tea one. The egg yolk bun was too sweet. And the beet and taro bun was so so. \n\nThe price seems average but it does seem pricier than regular, traditional dim sum. I was super stuffed after lunch.

As with all their other stuff, the wrapping is self-made in-house. 2/5 rating\n\nKing-Dum Xiao Long Bao (1pc/$8) - Soup dumpling large enough that you'll need a straw\nPork XLB (6pc/$8) - Pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine\nTom Yum Goong XLB (6pc/$9) - Pork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in a beet skin\n\nThe Pork XLB and Tom Yum Goong XLB came out at the same time. Served in an aluminum cup like most places do nowadays since people cant pick up XLB without breaking it, even if their lives depended on it. Flavor wise, they both were fairly similar. You can taste a slight more tartness to the Tom Yum Goong version (maybe it was just me) but flavor wise, really similar. \n\nPersonally, i didn't order the King-Dum but my friend did. It was served with a boba straw (Ow..?) Huge meat ball inside with some meat. The steamer is served on a small dish/bowl, which was a great idea and saving grace because his King-Dum popped on the bottom and all the soup went. The soup was fairly light, not too fatty. He said the normal XLBs were better in comparison in terms of skin thickness, flavor, etc. \n\nTrio of Buns (3pc/$5.5) consisting of Green Tea & Milk Bun, Beet & Taro Bun, and Egg Yolk Bun\n\nWhen this was served, the same friend who ordered the King-Dum and I heard Egg Yolk Bun. Our hopes were peaked when we had imagined it to be like the runny yolk inside like some dim sum places offer. We saved this for last, but unfortunately 2 other friends tried this first and killed our hopes.. The egg yolk bun was like a custard. The Green Tea & Milk bun was very fragrant and smelled amazing. Probably the best of the 3 IMO. Beet and Taro bun was nice with the taro filling as well. Good way to try all 3 \"Happy Endings\". \n\n----------------\n\nOverall, the place is nice to try, but im unsure if i would return again. Unique offerings but nothing too great in comparison to ones ive had in the past. Its all personal preference. Its great they make their wrapping/skins all themselves as its not really something a lot of places do anymore. Kind of pricey for the things offered but we were decently satisfied.

Same for the regular har gow, I did not bother to try the cream cheese har gow. The shrimp toast was tasty and unique, but on my way out I was disappointed to see that they were using store bought bread and just adding the shrimp paste. I guess this is no different from restaurants that buy their pasta instead of making it fresh, and it won't stop me from getting the shrimp toast again, I just hope they change that in the future.\n\nOverall, this place is off to a good start and as long as they don't keep bumping up their prices (seems some items have gone up from opening day) and maintain the consistency, it will be a SOMA go-to spot.\n\nLarge groups beware, lines form quickly.

There aren't really any seats around for people waiting, and most people wait outside, so expect to stand for a bit, and don't leave yet -- the food is worth it and it doesn't take too long for the food to get to you once your seated. \n\nSERVICE:\nWe ended up sitting outside, and despite it being a bit windy, it wasn't bad at all since they have 4 (i think) overhead heaters. I was scared that the tables were placed too closely and you could hear each other's conversations, but it actually wasn't, so cheers to that!\n\nNow, onto the delicious BAOSSS: \n**I love that all the dumplings come with their own specialized sauces**\n1) Vegetarian Dumpling (2/5) - Of all of food I got, this was the most beautiful dish. Funny story actually - the dumpling wrap is a deep green spinach wrap, and it was topped with all these beautiful vegetables that the spinach wrap camouflaged with it so I thought I ordered a salad ---until I dug in and realized they were dumplings. Most of the filling were chives, and the skin is on the thicker side, but it was appropriate for this dish. However, I'm personally not too big of a fan of chives, and this dish didn't super stand out for me. The halved cherry tomatoes and slices of radish (?) also didn't really add to the flavor of the dish, only the aesthetics. The sauce was a must to improve the taste of a rather blander tasting dumpling. \n2) Chicken Gyoza (5/5) - I loveeee this dish! There wasn't really any extra dumpling skin like you see with most dumplings, and the skin is a bit more glutinous, though not thaat thick. The filling itself had a lot of texture and wholesomeness with the wood ear mushroom (crunch) and the shiitake mushroom and chicken. The sauce also complimented the dumplings very well, though I probably could have eaten it without it. Only thing I would say is that it wasn't that crispy on the exterior, if that's what really matters to you. \n3) Chicken Bao (4/5) - Their baos are very soft, and the filling was delicious, chicken and wood ear mushroom. However, I wouldn't say it's super wow or anything. \n4) Pork XLB (5/5) - Its not easy to find places that make perfect XLB and this place is no exception - I have a bit of a higher standard for XLB. What I loveee about it is that the skin is thin, filled with plenty of delicious soup with a slight note of ginger, and the flavor of the whole thing is delicious. My only drawbacks are 1) most XLB I've had at traditional places aren't cooked in individualized foil trays, which easily causes the thin skin to rip and precious soup to spill out and 2) the meat was a little too soft for my taste - it kind of broke apart in my mouth rather than for me to chew it down - I like my texture! However, these two drawbacks couldn't bring down my impression of these wonderful juicy XLB. \n5) Trio Bun (4/5) - Again, super soft baos and though very delicious, it didn't have a \"WOW\" factor. The egg custard bun was very similar to what'd you find at dim sum restaurants, the filling being more on the pasty side than the liquidy yolk. The matcha bun had a white filling, with the texture similar to the egg custard bun, but having a great matcha taste. The taro bun was filled with reaaaal taro, mashed to a smoother consistency with a little bit of chunkiness.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the pork soup buns, the seafood gyoza (each one was filled with tons of huge shrimp and scallops), the chicken bao, and the pork dumplings.

We came here on a Saturday night, and the place was bustling. There was an indoor waiting area, which is basically their outdoor eating area, but it was nice because it was heated, and absolutely freezing outside. However we ended up waiting for a table for almost 40 minutes, and it was cool to walk in and see people making dumplings. The atmosphere was really hip with vibrant neon signs. \n\nWe got the:\n\n- Crispy Sesame Tofu Squares ($5): i was not too crazy about this. It tasted incredibly salty and the sauce was way to sweet for my taste. The texture on the outside is perfectly crispy, while the inside is so soft that it almost melts into your mouth, which I thought was really interesting, but I am not sure I loved. \n\n- Chicken Bao ($6) : This was probably my favorite dish we got there. It was perfectly stuffed with the right ratio of meat to bao, and the filling was really good. \n\n- Chicken Gyoza ($7.50) : The Gyoza was really interesting it was really crispy almost fried at the bottom and I enjoyed the stuffing, and overall it was average. It was a little saltier than I expected, but it seemed like a lot of other gyozas I have had before. \n\n-Vegetable Dumplings ($8) : I really enjoyed the vegetable dumpling filling. However be careful because the dish comes in a really aesthetic bowl topped with several different toppings, and my friend thought one of those toppings were tomatoes, and there were halves of cherry tomatoes, but she accidentally picked up straight up red chili and burnt her tongue. When the chili seeds touch the edge of the dumpling and you accidentally eat it I am not sure how I feel about this. I really liked the filling for the dumpling as it was very flavorful, but I was not a fan of the exterior. It was rather watery and kept breaking quickly. \n\n-Three Sum ($6) : This was really good! I really especially enjoyed the Egg Yolk Bun, then the Green Tea & Milk Bun, and finally the Beet & Taro Bun. The Egg Yolk Bun was so good, and I kind of wish we had just got three of those. The Beet & Taro was not too flavorful, but was still good. \n\nOverall I think the service is amazing, but it kind of felt like they wanted us to leave because right when we finished a dish, someone would take it away, which maybe I am just not used to, but my friend mentioned feeling this way as well.

There was 2 groups of 2 infront and I wrote my name down on the waiting list. The hostess 2as already seating the first party and checked the list after. So the second party didn't wrote their name down but I let them get seated first. There was more tables open and it wouldn't of made a difference. We got seated at the patio but there was no settings ready so the hostess went to grab them and then she forgot the menus. We sat for about 5 mins before the server came with water then I asked for the menu and he quickly went to get it and apologized. (He was very aplogoectic even though it was not his fault) another 5mins passed and we were ready to order but the waitress asked if we could move to another table and so she can seat a party of 5. I didn't mind so we agreed. The first what! The party didn't want to sit in the patio! Then she and her group decided the patio was ok. So we moved and they sat... Haha and next! They moved the 2 tables that were set up for them to connect with another! OMG! (Super irritated at these 5). Then after they sat for about 5 minutes and drank their water, they requested to move inside instead! Holy cow! This has nothing to do with the restaurant but I just wanted to say that the hostess handled herself very well handling this group!\n\nWe ordered everything we wanted and they had everything plus added new items since they opened (or the last I was here.)\n\nSeared chicken bao, pork xlb, 2 king dum, xi An Pork duMplings and clinatro har gow.\n\nFirst was the XiAn Pork Dumpling: Plating is nicely done but the garnishes didn't help add flavor to the Dumpling.

I had one that was super thick then 2 that were not. I wish there was more Juice in them (doesn't everyone ). The meat flavor was ok. One of them was super ginger-y.\n\nThird clinatro Har Gow: I expected the skin to be thinner but I have seen thicker. The taste is ok but it does come with a clinatro sauce which I good BUT if your food is flavored right... Why would I need to use the clinatro sauce? Just my thoughts !\n\nForth was the seared chicken bao: I like the bao. A lot and I don't eat bao. The meat is not juicy and I think there a way too much mushroom inside . Also for a seared bao, they outside of the bun is overly moist. Which makes it stick to your fingers.\n\nFifth : king Dum (king xlb) literally ordered it for the gram. Takes the longest... We ate everything and it still wasn't here....And tun tun tun... After 40mins it's sold out! Wtf! Waiter said it was system miscount. Haha sold out right before we ordered ...

There were 13 parties ahead of us when we first put our name on the list but 40-50% of them left so we didn't have to wait as long. \n\nI should preface by saying I am a snob when it comes to asian food. I only like authentic asian cuisines and this restaurant should be classified as asian fusion. \n\nFirst of all - This is not a Dim Sum restaurant. Dim Sum is cantonese and XLB are shanghainese. Jiao Zi and XLB is not Dim Sum. (XLB is commonly eaten at dimsum but it is not dim sum. It's Shanghainese) They do serve a weird version of \"har gow\" and a very americanized cha siu bao but those are the only items that can be considered dim sum. \n\nWe shared a number of items between the 4 of us. \n\nShrimp Toast - my friends like this one but I couldn't have it because it contained butter. What chinese restaurant uses butter? -- eek! definitely asian fusion. \nActually all of their dishes are asian fusion. Nothing that authentic. \nPork XLB - this one tasted okay, but they all came with diapers. I know they did this because americans can't pick up a xiao long bao properly with chopsticks, but just no. They also give you red vinegar to go with this dish. No. Pork XLB should be served with black vinegar. -__-\nTom Yum XLB - My friends liked this one too, but I'm born and raised in shanghai and this dish is terrible. \nGiant Bao - this one is the giant XLB that everyone sees in pictures. Ours did not come out looking pretty or tasting great. it was okay. \nXian Jiao Zi (Dumplings) - this was probably my favorite. They serve this like a little floral salad. It's pretty but I like my dumplings without extra olive oil. \nBeijing Noodles - comes with ground pork. It's pretty good, but very oily. \nPork Bao & Cha Siu Bao - both very small compared to other restaurants and nothing special. \n\nPortion sizes for everything were very small. Tasted above average for an americanized dumpling shop, but way way overpriced. Presentation is a novelty and really didn't add much -- sometimes it added negatively like in the case of XLB diapers. \n\nIf you don't eat asian food often and you want pay extra, waiters/waitresses that speak perfect english, plenty of inefficiencies just like a typical american restaurant then come to dumpling time! \nIf you actually want to experience real authentic chinese dumplings at a real chinese restaurant, do yourself a favor and head over to sunset, inner richmond (within SF) or millbrae, Cupertino.

After waiting for so long, my friends and I were excited to try their large XLB (the one that's so big you need a straw), but they were sold out!! We started with the shrimp toast, which is like a youtiao topped with a shrimp paste. I'm not sure if it was because we were starving, but we really enjoyed it. It was perfectly savory and the two different textures worked really well together. We also had their garlicky green beans which was very typical Chinese styled green beans, not all that special. Next came our pork bao that we requested to be pan fried. This was just a typical Chinese pork bun with lettuce and other vegetables. It wasn't all that special. We moved onto the two types of XLB- pork XLB and tom yum goong XLB. While both were filled with savory soups, we preferred the pork XLB over the tom yum goong XLB since it had less of a vinegry taste to it. The tom yum XLB wasn't spicy or sour like the soup usually is. Topped with meat and some ginger, the Beijing noodles were also pretty delicious, but it was definitely not enough to share for the 3 of us. We ended with the trio of happy ending buns- matcha and milk, egg yolk, and beet and taro bun. Of the 3 type of buns, the matcha and milk was our favorite, having a familiar custard-y, milky taste to it. \n\n- THE WAIT\nDO NOT go on a weekend unless you know that are first in line. We arrived on a Saturday around 12:30 PM and we waited until 1:58 PM to be seated (it closes at 2:00 PM). Our food took a while to get out since there was still a lot of people waiting for their food.  We were starving and cranky, making us feel that this trip to Dumpling Time wasn't worth it. \n\n- THE PRICES\nThe prices here are pretty steep, considering typical Chinese food isn't very expensive. However, this is more of an Americanized Chinese place and every plate is nearly $10 for just a few pieces.

This was the winning factor.\n\nTrendy dumpling place that is surprisingly delicious.\nI've had a lot of different types of dumplings in my life. XLB, regular dumplings, wontons, bao zi, you name it. I lived in Beijing for 7 years, home of dumpling makers. Which pretty much makes me a dumpling connoisseur :-) \n\n* Pork XLB ($8.50 for 6) - This was what made me respect the place. I cannot emphasize enough how many places I've been to that put XLB on their menu, that end up in disappointment. This is because the skin is too thick, there is NO soup, the soup LEAKS (bad craftsmanship), the skin sticks to the plating (bad execution). NOT HERE! It is very difficult to make XLB, clearly, given my multiple attempts to find places that make them well. The meat inside was tender and soft, as it should be. Not as a ball of meat that has been separated from the skin - because there was fat and it was not overcooked! A++\n\n* Shrimp toast ($8) - I love Chinese donut or \"you tiao\" and I've never considered it as a toast. This is what I mean by trendy / hip haha. I've only had it with congee or soymilk. It was indeed very delicious with shrimp on top. Very crispy!\n\n* Pork dumplings ($9 for 8) - Standard. Good.\n\n* King Dum ($9 for a big ol' thang) - This is the what people come here for, and the pics. Of course garnished with flower petals.... who would've thunk to use a boba straw for dumpling? -snaps pics- I've actually had a large XLB with a straw before in Shanghai so it was cool to see it being offered at a restaurant in the States. Personally, not for me because the skin was too thick. But the meat inside was nice and juicy.\n\n* Chicken / pork gyoza ($7.5 / $8 for 5) - Standard. Liked that the chicken gyoza had mushrooms in it. But 5 pieces for $8?! \n\n* Gan ban noodles ($9.50) - I LOVE cold noodles. This was delish! \n\n* Three sum (dessert) ($6) - Sums out, buns out. This threesum included 1) green tea & milk, 2) beet & taro, and 3) egg yolk. All were freaking delicious. Highly recommend if you are sharing. \n\nOVERALL, I would come back. There are places in Chinatown that have these prices & the quality of food / vibes are not to this standard.

I sent it 29 seconds ago!\" And, then they stand there and stare at you until you respond over email. \n\nGranted, emergencies come up that require your urgent response. But, when they're asking for bakery recommendations and what color fondant they should get for their bf's birthday cake that's 2 months and 11 days away...GTFOH! (Ok, I would never say that but c'mon now).\n\nAs you walk in, Dumpling Time has a dumpling exhibition area like Din Tai Fung. Here, you even enjoy your meal in front of the dumpling makers and watch the magic happen. Much props to them for having to deal with people watching their every move, snapping pics, and videotaping them (I was one of them). Imagine if someone watched us 24/7 at our cubicle/office. Yeaaa, PornHub will just have to wait. \n\nDumpling Time softly opened yesterday (thanks, Ann S. for the heads up) in the former Source and Dusty Buns space. It's walk-in only and no reservations. \n\nThe menu is comprised of Chinese and Japanese dumplings with a CA twist, baos, noodles, and small veggie side dishes. Everything is super reasonably priced with nothing over $9. Beer and wine only. \n\nMr. Diva likes to order a sh*t ton of food which I'm always down for. How else are you going to get a good sampling of the menu? We ordered the following:\n\n*Cucumber Salad ($3)\n*Pickled Lotus ($3)\n*Shrimp Toast ($6): http://bit.ly/2rslRT3\n*Shrimp Har Gow (4 pc - $6): http://bit.ly/2qxNaMu\n*Seafood Gyoza w/ spinach skin, spiced chili butter aioli (5 pc - $7.50): http://bit.ly/2r25QXw\n*Pork Gyoza (5 pc - $6.25): http://bit.ly/2rs2NEu\n*Pork XLB: Heritage pork, savory soup, shao-sing wine (6 pc - $6): http://bit.ly/2qSUN34\n*Tom Yum Goong: Heritage pork, black tiger shrimp, coconut milk, beet skin (6 pc - $7): http://bit.ly/2qtVX3U\n*Cha Siu Bao (BBQ Pork), pan seared (3 pc - $5): http://bit.ly/2pMi46l\n*Beijing Noodles w/ pork, green onion, ginger, soybean paste ($9): http://bit.ly/2rgk46Y\n*Bao Trio: Green Tea & Milk, Egg Yolk, Beet & Taro ($5): http://bit.ly/2rslFUj\n\nMy favorites...\nThe Shrimp Toast was a halved youtiao (Chinese cruller) that's topped with shrimp paste and a dollop of spicy aioli. Crunchy and chewy with a good amount of fresh shrimp paste. Carby goodness. \n\nThe Pork XLBs are the best in SF next to Yank Sing and Crystal Jade (better than DTF which is overrated IMO). The skin is thin and these bad boys are hella juicy. When you pick it up with your chopstick, the XLB sags like big 'ol tatas which is a good sign. I like to switch it up by biting a hole at the top and sucking the broth out, and popping a whole one in my mouth. If you do the latter, be prepared for a wonderful broth EXPLOSION in your mouth! It's served with red wine vinegar and ginger. Personally, I like black vinegar more (smoky) so I hope they have that option in the future. \n\nThe Cha Siu Bao (pan seared) had nicely browned, crisp bottoms and fluffy tops with a savory pork filling. The filling is slightly creamier than the traditional filling since they add peanut butter. \n\nI love har gow and these were a good fusion rendition with a cream cheese filling and a chimichurri-like dipping sauce. The barely translucent skin had a good stretchy chew and was generously filled with plump shrimp. I know it sounds a little odd but the combo of cheese, shrimp, and the herby green sauce had delicious layers of flavors. \n\nThe Green Tea & Milk Bao was the perfect ending to our meal. Didn't taste much green tea but the bao was soft and the filling was like a creamy milky custard. Very yummy. \n\nMy least favorite was the Beijing Noodles (Zhajiangmian). The handmade noodles were overcooked and soggy. \n\nThe staff was friendly but a little on the green side. It wasn't clear who are server was was so ended up flagging down various servers when we didn't receive certain orders. Totally understandable given it was day one and I'm sure they'll ramp up soon. \n\nThe owner did a great job revamping the former Source and Dusty Bun space into a hip and chic yet casual space with a hand drawn mural, a beautifully statuesque floral arrangement in the center of the dining room, and Chinese movies playing on the wall. There's ample seating so it's great for a casual date or for a small group dinner. Can't wait until they open their front patio so I can bring TT along. \n\nParking can be tough on the weekdays because of nearby offices but it's super easy on the weekends. \n\nSolid food and properly made dumplings that will appease both Chinese traditionalists and modernists, and most importantly, at non-gentrification prices (please don't compare this to your fav hole-in-the-wall on Clement), Dumpling Time is going to be the new hot spot in SF!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-05-18"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Pork Bao, Pork Xiao Long Bao, Pork Gyoza, Siu Mai, and Har Gao.

We ordered: \n+ Tom Yum XLB $9/6: My friends weren't the biggest fan of the flavor, but I actually thought it tasted pretty good with a kick of spiciness\n+ XL XLB $8: Apparently they only have a limited number of these per day. The concept is definitely unique and originated from Shanghai. The bun itself is really pretty, but the content on the inside is lacking meat and mostly contains pork juice. Not sure it's worth $8. \n+ Trio of yolk buns $5.50: matcha bun, regular yolk bun and beet and taro bun. The matcha bun has very subtle flavor, taro and beet was voted least favored in our group and yolk bun was most favored. \n+ Pork Gyoza $5: tasted like any other gyoza with added decoration that makes the dish look more appealing. \n+ Sui Mai $5: this was their special of the day. It tasted like any other sui mai at typical dim sum places, but I did appreciate that it didn't have chucks of fat in it like some lower quality places. \n\nSERVICE: \nFriendly waiters, although it does take awhile to flag someone down when it gets super busy. The food came out somewhat promptly considering how busy it was. We came here 10min before they opened and there was already a crowd - we ended up waiting about 1 hr to be seated. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThere is plenty of parking nearby so that's a big bonus. There is seating inside and outside, but not very big compared to typical dum sum restaurant. Very clean and brightly lit.

This was the winning factor.\n\nTrendy dumpling place that is surprisingly delicious.\nI've had a lot of different types of dumplings in my life. XLB, regular dumplings, wontons, bao zi, you name it. I lived in Beijing for 7 years, home of dumpling makers. Which pretty much makes me a dumpling connoisseur :-) \n\n* Pork XLB ($8.50 for 6) - This was what made me respect the place. I cannot emphasize enough how many places I've been to that put XLB on their menu, that end up in disappointment. This is because the skin is too thick, there is NO soup, the soup LEAKS (bad craftsmanship), the skin sticks to the plating (bad execution). NOT HERE! It is very difficult to make XLB, clearly, given my multiple attempts to find places that make them well. The meat inside was tender and soft, as it should be. Not as a ball of meat that has been separated from the skin - because there was fat and it was not overcooked! A++\n\n* Shrimp toast ($8) - I love Chinese donut or \"you tiao\" and I've never considered it as a toast. This is what I mean by trendy / hip haha. I've only had it with congee or soymilk. It was indeed very delicious with shrimp on top. Very crispy!\n\n* Pork dumplings ($9 for 8) - Standard. Good.\n\n* King Dum ($9 for a big ol' thang) - This is the what people come here for, and the pics. Of course garnished with flower petals.... who would've thunk to use a boba straw for dumpling? -snaps pics- I've actually had a large XLB with a straw before in Shanghai so it was cool to see it being offered at a restaurant in the States. Personally, not for me because the skin was too thick. But the meat inside was nice and juicy.\n\n* Chicken / pork gyoza ($7.5 / $8 for 5) - Standard. Liked that the chicken gyoza had mushrooms in it. But 5 pieces for $8?! \n\n* Gan ban noodles ($9.50) - I LOVE cold noodles. This was delish! \n\n* Three sum (dessert) ($6) - Sums out, buns out. This threesum included 1) green tea & milk, 2) beet & taro, and 3) egg yolk. All were freaking delicious. Highly recommend if you are sharing. \n\nOVERALL, I would come back. There are places in Chinatown that have these prices & the quality of food / vibes are not to this standard.

This is the prettiest dim sum you'll ever eat.\n\nFor the full-review, I'll be going over all the dishes (in order) my girlfriend and I ordered on very empty stomachs after a BART ride: \n\n~ THE FOOD ~\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Pickled Lotus, $5 - it's basically a lighter version of a classic lotus dish.  It had more of a vinegar taste and not long marinated, but if you like lotus and that satisfying crunch, it was a really refreshing take and fantastic palate cleanser between later dishes.\n\nThe first main item that arrived was the Seafood Gyoza, $9.5 for 5pc.  Holy crap.  This was an instant 10/10, beyond amazing with the paired sauces.  Everything about it tasted amazing, the seafood mixture, sauces, and crispiness of the pan-fried bottom was paired perfectly.  Definitely order this if you like anything seafood related or a texture/flavor bomb.\n\nWe later ordered Chicken Gyoza, $7 got 5pc, btw.  It was still great (like a 8/10 relative to the seafood gyoza) but didn't have that euphoric food wars-esque feeling when we ate it.\n\nMoving onto bao's, we got the Char-Siu Bao, $6 for 3pc.  We weren't unanimous on our love for it, but overall it was really good.  The char-siu flavor wasn't super strong or candied tasting, but the peanut butter worked really well actually - it was more like a peanut satay sauce.  The actual dough was super light, fluffy, and mildly sweet with a perfect proportion of filling to bun.  I wish I tried the pan-seared option though, heads up that you can take advantage of that.\n\nNow for the real reason we came here initially: the xiao long bao, specically the KING DUM, $8 for 1 ~massive~ piece.  The King Dum is by far, the prettiest, largest, soupiest xiaolongbao I've ever had.  It was literally a massive XLB, everything else was the same, except it came with a bunch of pretty flowers and stuff on top too.  It definitely had a ton of soup, and the novelty to drink soup out of a boba straw is worth it the first time.  Otherwise, it's clearly not a go-to dish to share with friends or order beyond the initial holyfriggincrapsnapchat factor.\n\nPork Xiao long bao, $8 for 6pcs.  Now I would get this on a daily basis if I could.  This is just a traditional, perfectly executed rendition of the nostalgic XLB we all crave.  The price is pretty fair imo - for comparison, Berkeley's cheapest is around $6-7 for 6pcs.\n\nOnto dessert, the Happy Endings (lmao).  We ordered the Trio of Buns, $5.50 for 3pcs.  It's pretty much what you would expect.  The egg yolk was definitely the best, had a fantastic rich flavor with that filling.  The green tea and milk was mainly milky tasting, and the beet and taro was essentially a colorful taro bun with minimal flavor.  They were all good and light tasting, but the egg custard bun would be my sole order next time.\n\n~ PRICE, AMBIANCE ~\n\nGrand total was about $35/person after everything, and it was definitely worth it (especially considering SF food prices).  My girlfriend and I were both stuffed with dim-sum beyond the grade of a traditional restaurant.  Even though it didn't have the entertaining push-cart system where you point, over-order, and get a wide plethora of dishes, I still loved the experience.  Dishes came really fast, though you could hear them preparing it fresh in the kitchen after you ordered.\n\nOn that note, tips: If you seat near the kitchen, the sizzling is super, super loud.  You have the option of sitting outside, though it could also get some street noise or wind.  Otherwise the restaurant is bright, nicely decorated, and casual.\n\n10/10 would seafood gyoza again", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["The chicken gyoza, steamed pork buns, and egg yolk dessert buns are must haves!\n\n"], "author": "Elena K.", "review": "I almost let the low stars keep me from going to this restaurant, and I'm so glad I didn't!

There aren't really any seats around for people waiting, and most people wait outside, so expect to stand for a bit, and don't leave yet -- the food is worth it and it doesn't take too long for the food to get to you once your seated. \n\nSERVICE:\nWe ended up sitting outside, and despite it being a bit windy, it wasn't bad at all since they have 4 (i think) overhead heaters. I was scared that the tables were placed too closely and you could hear each other's conversations, but it actually wasn't, so cheers to that!\n\nNow, onto the delicious BAOSSS: \n**I love that all the dumplings come with their own specialized sauces**\n1) Vegetarian Dumpling (2/5) - Of all of food I got, this was the most beautiful dish. Funny story actually - the dumpling wrap is a deep green spinach wrap, and it was topped with all these beautiful vegetables that the spinach wrap camouflaged with it so I thought I ordered a salad ---until I dug in and realized they were dumplings. Most of the filling were chives, and the skin is on the thicker side, but it was appropriate for this dish. However, I'm personally not too big of a fan of chives, and this dish didn't super stand out for me. The halved cherry tomatoes and slices of radish (?) also didn't really add to the flavor of the dish, only the aesthetics. The sauce was a must to improve the taste of a rather blander tasting dumpling. \n2) Chicken Gyoza (5/5) - I loveeee this dish! There wasn't really any extra dumpling skin like you see with most dumplings, and the skin is a bit more glutinous, though not thaat thick. The filling itself had a lot of texture and wholesomeness with the wood ear mushroom (crunch) and the shiitake mushroom and chicken. The sauce also complimented the dumplings very well, though I probably could have eaten it without it. Only thing I would say is that it wasn't that crispy on the exterior, if that's what really matters to you. \n3) Chicken Bao (4/5) - Their baos are very soft, and the filling was delicious, chicken and wood ear mushroom. However, I wouldn't say it's super wow or anything. \n4) Pork XLB (5/5) - Its not easy to find places that make perfect XLB and this place is no exception - I have a bit of a higher standard for XLB. What I loveee about it is that the skin is thin, filled with plenty of delicious soup with a slight note of ginger, and the flavor of the whole thing is delicious. My only drawbacks are 1) most XLB I've had at traditional places aren't cooked in individualized foil trays, which easily causes the thin skin to rip and precious soup to spill out and 2) the meat was a little too soft for my taste - it kind of broke apart in my mouth rather than for me to chew it down - I like my texture! However, these two drawbacks couldn't bring down my impression of these wonderful juicy XLB. \n5) Trio Bun (4/5) - Again, super soft baos and though very delicious, it didn't have a \"WOW\" factor. The egg custard bun was very similar to what'd you find at dim sum restaurants, the filling being more on the pasty side than the liquidy yolk. The matcha bun had a white filling, with the texture similar to the egg custard bun, but having a great matcha taste. The taro bun was filled with reaaaal taro, mashed to a smoother consistency with a little bit of chunkiness.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-23"}, {"excerpts": [":\n- Beijing Noodles: 4/5\n- Gan Ban Noodles: 3/5\n- Chicken Gyoza: 4/5\n"], "author": "Yuliana Z.", "review": "So this is definitely more like an asian fusion place instead of Cantonese dim sum place.

The restaurant was hip and new, and I overall enjoyed the setting and service. If you're looking for legit authentic dumplings though, I'd recommend going to another dumpling place (dumpling kitchen in taraval is amaaaaazing!).\n\nThe baos were just aiight. We got them panfried but they still seemed pretty doughy/fluffy (I was expecting something like shen jian bao but they weren't quite like that). The BBQ pork was pretty good (but I have to say, I just had the baked BBQ pork buns at Dragon Beaux and nothing compares to those!). Chicken/mushroom were fine too.\n\nI found the xi'an dumplings kinda strange. They were presented with this super fancy/new American-esque fresh salad and cherry tomatoes but the dumplings themselves were still warm and tasted pretty similar to the gyoza meat we had so I wasn't really sure why it was presented in a salad. Not bad at all, just a little odd, lol.\n\nDessert buns (we got the trio) weren't that great, I'd pass. Usually lava buns are oozing with super soft almost liquid egg yolk but these weren't oozy at all! Flavor was okay but not as rich and luscious as the ones I'm used to (omg they are so amazing at dragon beaux - sorry I keep comparing the food to dragon beaux but it's hard because I was just there :p).

We came here on a Saturday night, and the place was bustling. There was an indoor waiting area, which is basically their outdoor eating area, but it was nice because it was heated, and absolutely freezing outside. However we ended up waiting for a table for almost 40 minutes, and it was cool to walk in and see people making dumplings. The atmosphere was really hip with vibrant neon signs. \n\nWe got the:\n\n- Crispy Sesame Tofu Squares ($5): i was not too crazy about this. It tasted incredibly salty and the sauce was way to sweet for my taste. The texture on the outside is perfectly crispy, while the inside is so soft that it almost melts into your mouth, which I thought was really interesting, but I am not sure I loved. \n\n- Chicken Bao ($6) : This was probably my favorite dish we got there. It was perfectly stuffed with the right ratio of meat to bao, and the filling was really good. \n\n- Chicken Gyoza ($7.50) : The Gyoza was really interesting it was really crispy almost fried at the bottom and I enjoyed the stuffing, and overall it was average. It was a little saltier than I expected, but it seemed like a lot of other gyozas I have had before. \n\n-Vegetable Dumplings ($8) : I really enjoyed the vegetable dumpling filling. However be careful because the dish comes in a really aesthetic bowl topped with several different toppings, and my friend thought one of those toppings were tomatoes, and there were halves of cherry tomatoes, but she accidentally picked up straight up red chili and burnt her tongue. When the chili seeds touch the edge of the dumpling and you accidentally eat it I am not sure how I feel about this. I really liked the filling for the dumpling as it was very flavorful, but I was not a fan of the exterior. It was rather watery and kept breaking quickly. \n\n-Three Sum ($6) : This was really good! I really especially enjoyed the Egg Yolk Bun, then the Green Tea & Milk Bun, and finally the Beet & Taro Bun. The Egg Yolk Bun was so good, and I kind of wish we had just got three of those. The Beet & Taro was not too flavorful, but was still good. \n\nOverall I think the service is amazing, but it kind of felt like they wanted us to leave because right when we finished a dish, someone would take it away, which maybe I am just not used to, but my friend mentioned feeling this way as well. I am not too sure if I would come here again because although it was incredibly good it seemed so overpriced and I feel like I have definetly had better food at other places.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["I don't eat pork or beef but we tried the chicken bao and chicken gyoza (spelling?)

Lets eat....\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes before opening and there were a few people before my party. This place is so cute! Perfect for SoMa. It IS dog friendly but furry friends must sit in the outdoor patio area (i know it's cold, don't worry there's heater lamps and they can zip up the walls). Ambiance + Service + Food were amazing!!! \n\nHOT TEAS.\nBI LAO CHUN GREEN TEA ($3.5) - Gentle, mild sweet, fruity aroma. Presentation of my tea was absolutely beautiful served in a clear glass individual pot with full bodied fresh herbs at the bottom. The first sip was very light and definitely gentle - probably the most gentle tea I have ever had. Impressive. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nFOODS. \nYou've been warned: they don't serve rice!\n\nGARLICY GREEN BEANS ($8) -  Perfectly sauteed garlic green beans garnished with edible baby flowers. The presentation was beautiful and inviting. The green beans weren't soggy or too crispy and the garlic flavor wasn't overpowering yet present. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nSEAFOOD GYOZA (5pc/$10) - Spinach skin, crab, scallop, shrimp, with spiced chili butter. I do love seafood but not too much seafood where it's overkill. We ordered this because the server had recommended it and I was hesitant it was going to be to seafoody but it wasn't. The spinach skin helped break the seafood taste. I tasted shrimp and scallops the most of the three seafoods. I would prefer the skin to be a little bit more cooked and crisped but afraid doing so would look the bright green color of the wrapper. RECOMMEND.\n\nPORK XLB (6pc/$8.50) - Pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine. If you know me, I am a XLB snob. Their XLB was executed perfectly!!! OMG!!! Perfect thickness of the skin (not too thick and not too thin), very soft, and fragile. The meat filling was rich in flavor and there was plenty of broth. I had a foodgasm pricking a hole and sipping it's juice and then putting it wholesomely in my mouth. Yah, get that mind out the gutter.  I wish they had steamed the dumplings not in mini cupcake wrappers and found a different method, they tend to tear easily when trying to separate them. This was my favorite item at the restaurant. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nHAR GOW SHRIMP (4pc/$6.50) - shrimp, cream cheese, juicy pork. I thought this was going to be the typical Har Gow dumpling because it looked typical. But the cream cheese adds a little more creaminess to the filling. We were planning to order the Shrimp and Cilantro but this comes with a unique green cilantro dipping sauce. The cilantro flavor isn't strong in the dipping sauce but it adds that nice veggie/herb taste with the shrimp. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nBEIJING NOODLES ($9.50) - Pork, green onion, ginger, soybean paste. I've had this before and there wasn't anything too special with their take on the noodles. I did notice pork sauce was rich and hearty that we didn't need too much of this. RECOMMEND.\n\nHAPPY ENDINGS.\nGREEN TEA & MILK BUN 3 pcs/$6.50 - Such a sweet treat at the end of a delicious meal. Three steamed milk buns (green, white, red) filled with flavored custard. I think my favorite one was the white one, it had a milky vanilla filling. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nYup, I do love this place and if I ever move back I will be a regular.\n\nJABA APPROVED.

Can see why this place is quite popular- decent vibe and food!  Not the most amazing, best dumplings I've ever had in my life, but it's pretty good.  Came 11:30am on a Sunday and got seats 10 min after signing in.\n\nVenue / Service: clean and bright on the inside, though it does feel cramped.  We sat nearby the kitchen and the servers were moving so quickly past each other that some glassware fell and broke. The kitchen is open so you get to see them making the dumplings which is cool to watch!  \n\nFood: it's pretty much all about the dumplings, so be prepared to carb-load a bit!  Would probably limit the number of baos if you don't wanna get full too quickly.\n-- CHICKEN BAO seared (Chicken, green onion, mushroom, ginger)(3pcs/$6) - decent amount of filling inside vs. wrapper, and it was quite tasty!  Love the green onion and ginger to brighten up the otherwise heavy filling.  \n\n-- PORK XLB (pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine)(6pcs/$8.50) - hard to go wrong with XLBs but these were quite good.  The wrapper is super thin, so be careful of breaking them when you are trying to take them out of the container.  Soup was nice and light yet savory, and the pork had a nice texture.  \n\n-- KING-DUM (1pc/$9) - pretty much is the equivalent of 6 of the smaller XLBs.  The wrapper is quite thick, unlike the regular XLBs and you have to poke a hole in it with your straw so that the filling / soup inside will cool (which took quite a while).  There's a LOT of filling so keep this in mind if you are ordering other dishes.  Overall, I think I preferred the smaller XLBs in terms of easiness to eat, but it's a fun dish to try.  \n\n-- Three-sum dessert buns (green tea / milk, beet / taro, and egg yolk)(3pcs/$6) - our favorite was the egg yolk flavor-wise, though the beet taro combo was an interesting one.  The green-tea / milk one was slightly on the sweeter side for us, but appreciated how these had a decent amount of filling vs. the wrapper.  \n\nAll in all, this isn't the absolute best dumplings I've had, but they are higher on my list.

This place is located in like the \"arts district\" or according to google maps, \"Design District\". Depending on which way you are coming from, you may not see it so easily. Their sign is blocked in one way by their exterior seating. The restaurant opens at 11AM but people will start signing up on the list at probably 1030AM or so. Parking is fairly ample but you see a lot of people arriving by Uber/Lyft. We were like the 2nd or 3rd group to arrive. They started seating people promptly at 11AM.\n\nAfter being seated, of course we referred to Yelp for some suggestions. Shrimp toast and Trio of Buns were one of the top recommendations so thats what we got and a few other things \n\nShrimp Toast ($8)\n\nUnlike the typical \"toast\", this shrimp toast uses \"you tiao/yao tiu\", a traditional chinese breakfast favorite which is like a chinese donut. The shrimp is a paste of chopped shrimp lined inbetween the groove you'd typically see in you tiao. The shrimp had a pretty good texture and flavor. Unfortunately the you tiao was cold and not that crispy. If they were able to keep it crispy and warm, it would be great ! 4/5 rating \n\nChicken Bao (3pc/$5.5) - Chicken ,green onion, wood ear mushroom, ginger\nChar-Siu Bao (3pc/$6) - Char-siu roast pork belly, touch of peanut butter\nBao may also be ordered crispy (pan seared)\n\nThe baos were pretty tasty. The char-siu pork was actually fairly light in flavor. The chicken reminded me of the \"big buns\" i get with meat filled. Both were pretty nice in flavor. The bao itself was soft. Not as chewy i had hoped for in a well made bun. Doesn't give that \"bounce\". 4/5 rating ! \n\nPork Xi'An Dumpling (8pc/$9) - Pork, cabbage, green onion decorated with thinly sliced radish, micro greens \n\nThe xi'an dumpling, despite the pretty presentation in a bowl, was probably the most disappointing of them all. Dumpling was a bit plain in flavor and the xi'an sauce was a bit plain in flavor as well. As with all their other stuff, the wrapping is self-made in-house. 2/5 rating\n\nKing-Dum Xiao Long Bao (1pc/$8) - Soup dumpling large enough that you'll need a straw\nPork XLB (6pc/$8) - Pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine\nTom Yum Goong XLB (6pc/$9) - Pork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in a beet skin\n\nThe Pork XLB and Tom Yum Goong XLB came out at the same time. Served in an aluminum cup like most places do nowadays since people cant pick up XLB without breaking it, even if their lives depended on it. Flavor wise, they both were fairly similar. You can taste a slight more tartness to the Tom Yum Goong version (maybe it was just me) but flavor wise, really similar. \n\nPersonally, i didn't order the King-Dum but my friend did. It was served with a boba straw (Ow..?) Huge meat ball inside with some meat. The steamer is served on a small dish/bowl, which was a great idea and saving grace because his King-Dum popped on the bottom and all the soup went. The soup was fairly light, not too fatty. He said the normal XLBs were better in comparison in terms of skin thickness, flavor, etc. \n\nTrio of Buns (3pc/$5.5) consisting of Green Tea & Milk Bun, Beet & Taro Bun, and Egg Yolk Bun\n\nWhen this was served, the same friend who ordered the King-Dum and I heard Egg Yolk Bun. Our hopes were peaked when we had imagined it to be like the runny yolk inside like some dim sum places offer. We saved this for last, but unfortunately 2 other friends tried this first and killed our hopes.. The egg yolk bun was like a custard. The Green Tea & Milk bun was very fragrant and smelled amazing. Probably the best of the 3 IMO. Beet and Taro bun was nice with the taro filling as well. Good way to try all 3 \"Happy Endings\". \n\n----------------\n\nOverall, the place is nice to try, but im unsure if i would return again. Unique offerings but nothing too great in comparison to ones ive had in the past. Its all personal preference. Its great they make their wrapping/skins all themselves as its not really something a lot of places do anymore. Kind of pricey for the things offered but we were decently satisfied.

Likely fat, but it leads to a distinct dumpling flavor that is more fatty than I liked.  The dumpling skin is on the thicker side as well.

Another slight variation with green Gyoza skin and lots of high quality seafood and Pork.  Cooked very nicely and juicy with a crispy exterior.  The butter dipping sauce and traditional soy dipping sauce were nice additions. \n\nBeijing Noodles - $9. Basic dish with delicious house made noodles and a simple but tasty stir fried Tan Tan sauce.

"], "author": "Miranda T.", "review": "I really wanted to like this place, but I'd say it's just a pricier hipster dumpling spot. I'm a HUGE dumplings fan, and I've been to many in San Francisco, but this doesn't make the top dumplings place on my list. The presentation was good, especially for the king xlb and pork dumplings, but see below for my comments on each dish we ordered. \n\nWait time: We arrived around 5:10 pm on a Friday and added ourselves to the waitlist. There were already a few groups hanging around also waiting outside. (It opens at 5:30 pm). \n\nDesign: \n- There's a big window at the entrance that shows the chefs preparing the handmade dumplings. \n- Indoor and outdoor seating \n- Modern & hipster \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\n1. First to come out was the pork xian ($9 for 8 pieces). The presentation was nice - it was loaded with garlic and chives on top. The skin was very smooth and soft!! You can tell it was freshly made. But in my opinion, the skin was just the best part of this dish. \n\n2. Second to arrive was the seafood gyoza ($9.50 for 5 pieces). I only ordered this because other Yelp reviews claimed it was good. To be honest, it wasn't anything great. The buttery sauce that came with it was awkward and didn't mix well, but the other soy sauce with it mixed better. It was more like a green skinned ha gaw. Pricey for just 5 pieces of mediocre gyoza :/ \n\n3. Third to arrive was the pork XLB ($8 for 8 pieces). Again, the skin was good, but it wasn't anything better than I've had before. :( \n\n4. Last to arrive was the King XLB. ($8 for one piece). This dish apparently takes 25 minutes to cook, so it'd be best to order this immediately upon sitting/ordering. This was the only reason why we wanted to come. I've been wanting to go to a dumpling place with a straw to drink the soup (I've only seen this in la). I believe Dumpling Time is the first place in NorCal to have this. It's definitely the biggest soup dumplings I've had, and the first I've drank with a straw! This was the best dish we've ordered all night. It was large, juicy, soft, and flavorful. The soup was fresh, and so were the tender pork and skin. Yes, it can get messy and the soup eventually seeps through the bottom. \n\nWe ordered 2 king xlb's but the second one took FOREVER to come out. We waited so long, and saw so many other people's King xlb's come out that we eventually got frustrated and asked our waiter to check up on it. She said \"it's coming\" 2 times, but we still waited and waited. She then came back and said it would take another 3 minutes. At that point; we didn't want to wait anymore. She gave us the option to wait or cancel the order, so we did cancel it. After we canceled it, her whole demeanor changed. She wasn't nice or friendly, and the way she grabbed our bill and gave it back was with attitude. Hello...it's not our fault the food took forever to come out. There's no reason to give us attitude when we're the paying customers that waited and didn't ask to cancel until she gave us that option. \n\nAll in all, this was definitely a one time experience. I understand why this would be a \"hit spot\" in SoMa because there's not many in that area. But from my experience, there's a lot more better priced dumplings and flavorful tastes in other parts of SF.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-07-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered the Tom yum soup XLB, pork XLB, Beijing noodles, and the trio of buns.

Much props to them for having to deal with people watching their every move, snapping pics, and videotaping them (I was one of them). Imagine if someone watched us 24/7 at our cubicle/office. Yeaaa, PornHub will just have to wait. \n\nDumpling Time softly opened yesterday (thanks, Ann S. for the heads up) in the former Source and Dusty Buns space. It's walk-in only and no reservations. \n\nThe menu is comprised of Chinese and Japanese dumplings with a CA twist, baos, noodles, and small veggie side dishes. Everything is super reasonably priced with nothing over $9. Beer and wine only. \n\nMr. Diva likes to order a sh*t ton of food which I'm always down for.

Crunchy and chewy with a good amount of fresh shrimp paste. Carby goodness. \n\nThe Pork XLBs are the best in SF next to Yank Sing and Crystal Jade (better than DTF which is overrated IMO). The skin is thin and these bad boys are hella juicy. When you pick it up with your chopstick, the XLB sags like big 'ol tatas which is a good sign. I like to switch it up by biting a hole at the top and sucking the broth out, and popping a whole one in my mouth. If you do the latter, be prepared for a wonderful broth EXPLOSION in your mouth! It's served with red wine vinegar and ginger. Personally, I like black vinegar more (smoky) so I hope they have that option in the future. \n\nThe Cha Siu Bao (pan seared) had nicely browned, crisp bottoms and fluffy tops with a savory pork filling. The filling is slightly creamier than the traditional filling since they add peanut butter. \n\nI love har gow and these were a good fusion rendition with a cream cheese filling and a chimichurri-like dipping sauce. The barely translucent skin had a good stretchy chew and was generously filled with plump shrimp. I know it sounds a little odd but the combo of cheese, shrimp, and the herby green sauce had delicious layers of flavors. \n\nThe Green Tea & Milk Bao was the perfect ending to our meal. Didn't taste much green tea but the bao was soft and the filling was like a creamy milky custard. Very yummy. \n\nMy least favorite was the Beijing Noodles (Zhajiangmian). The handmade noodles were overcooked and soggy. \n\nThe staff was friendly but a little on the green side. It wasn't clear who are server was was so ended up flagging down various servers when we didn't receive certain orders. Totally understandable given it was day one and I'm sure they'll ramp up soon. \n\nThe owner did a great job revamping the former Source and Dusty Bun space into a hip and chic yet casual space with a hand drawn mural, a beautifully statuesque floral arrangement in the center of the dining room, and Chinese movies playing on the wall. There's ample seating so it's great for a casual date or for a small group dinner.

Your entire party needs to be present in order for them to seat you. We witnessed a group that was not complete and were not seated until their whole party was there even though the restaurant was practically empty so be sure to come together! The restaurant is pretty big with at least 20+ tables.\n\nThe waiters and chefs were so nice! The service is great and our water carafes were always refilled before it was empty and we had a tiny table with a ton of food and our dishes were cleared fairly quickly.\n\nWe had the chance to try sooo much food between two people so don't judge :p\n\nGarlicky Green Beans - $8 (Rating: 3.25/5)\nI've had better at Kingdom of Dumplings. They were ok but not great and they weren't hot when they came out. The sauce wasn't too flavorful but if you are someone who doesn't need much flavor, you'll like it!\n\nShrimp Toast - $8 (Rating: 3.5/5)\nAfter reading all the reviews prior to coming here, I was expecting this dish to be the bombb! It's literally a chinese donut (which was cooked well and crispy) with a bit of shrimp mixture placed in a hole on top. There was some sort of chinese mustard/mayo lined under the bottom for extra taste which complemented it well. I think this dish is all hype but definitely something you should try yourself. You'll like it if you're a fan of chinese donut/have never tried.\n\nSeafood Gyoza - $9.50 for 5 pieces (Rating: 4/5)\nThe gyoza (potsticker) came out with a green skin made of spinach! The filling had crab, scallop and shrimp and was so flavorful! We almost didn't order gyoza since we didn't think it would be anything special but I'm glad we tried it! There was a semi-crispy layer under the gyoza which is a plus but my friend was hoping it would have been a little crispier. However, I recommend this dish!\n\nBeijing Noodles - $9 (Rating: 4/5)\nReviews raved about this dish so I had to get it! It was good, but it wasn't as amazing as everyone made it sound. I do recommend ordering this dish though because it was flavorful. The noodles were a bit too soft for me but still good. The portion wasn't too big and was easily split into two small bowls but it was perfect for us since there were only two of us. I would order this again!\n\nShrimp & Cilantro Har Gow - $6 for 4 pieces (Rating: 3.75/5)\nShrimp, cilantro, juicy pork goodness?! I didn't expect to like this dish but I did! The skin was made well and the flavors were good. If you like har gow, I recommend this since their regular one comes with cream cheese and I'm not sure how I would like that.. but it sounds different?\n\nKing-Dum Xiao Long Bao - $8 for 1 large one! (Rating: 4/5)\nSuch a cute name! To my surprise, it was pretty good. It's large enough you get a straw to drink the soup out of it! It was kind of hard to eat but you definitely have to order it if you like taking pictures of your food. It was cool to drink my soup through a straw out of the top of my dumpling.\n\nPork XLB - $8 for 6 pieces (Rating: 4/5)\nThe smaller version of the large XLB ^ and it was good. The skin isn't as thin as Din Tai Fung's but it's still pretty good!\n\nTom Yum Goong XLB - $9 for 6 pieces (Rating: 4/5)\nPork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in a beet skin which made the skin a bright wine color! To my surprise, I liked this dish a lot because it's different. The flavors were good because I do love Tom Yum soup! I recommend trying this dish.\n\nTrio of Buns \"Happy Endings\" - $5.50 for 3 pieces (Rating: 3.5/5)\nHave you ever tried a bun with custard or milk filling inside? It's pretty good here! There's 3 different colored buns with either custard or milk filling inside. The green one has a green tea flavored bun. We were too full to try the red one to see how the bun tasted. The filling inside isn't the liquidy texture but it's still good. I've had better but the bun flavor is a really cool concept. I'd recommend trying it if you've never tried it.\n\nOverall, this restaurant surprised us! We didn't expect to walk out liking it and eat as much as we did. Of course we had a lot of leftovers but we got to try almost everything! It was easy to find parking in this area so that was a huge plus. I'll definitely be back to try more!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-09-28"}, {"excerpts": ["BUT was pleasantly surprised and everything was very yummy\n+ Pork XLB (4/5) ", "6 pieces -- good and very tasty\n+ Tom Yum BLX (4/5) 6 pieces -- unique flavor, soupy, and satisfying\n+ Beijing noodles (4/5) -- would have loved this more if they had more noodles instead of beef, and it wasn't saucy enough, but overall I was very satisfied with this!\n", "+ Seafood gyoza with spiced chili butter (5/5) 5 pieces -- THIS was my favorite, and pretty unique cause it was def a fusion type of dish.

And go in a group to try the most!\n\nBeijing Noodles: This is one of my favorite things to order! The noodles are perfectly cooked, but the winner is the ground pork in this dish. It just lends SO much incredible flavor with the ginger and soybean paste! Highly recommend!\n\nGan Ban Noodles: If you're vegetarian or not, I think this dish is solid and differs a lot from the Beijing Noodles to give variety. They are generous with the veggies and it comes in this tasty light peanut flavored sauce. Super good!\n\nShrimp + Cilantro Har Gow: My group wasn't big into cream cheese so we got this one and boy is it yummy! The cilantro just goes so well with the shrimp and the har gow wrapper is perfectly sticky - great texture and flavor combined!\n\nPork Xi'an Dumpling: These were the dumplings with the most subtle flavor in my opinion, but I also think they tasted the freshest. So don't expect outrageous flavor, but it's done well if you appreciate the subtlety :).\n\nPork XLB: I think Dumpling Time did these well, but I don't think it's the best you can find in SF.

That being said, this is still a great place to go when you need your soup dumpling fix and I'd argue it's better than the Din Tai Fung in San Jose.\n\nSeafood Gyoza: These might have been my favorite from the dumplings. The gyoza comes out nice and crispy and I just loved the spinach skin, holding a sizeable amount of flavorful seafood inside. I'd recommend these for gyoza fans :). \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this trendy spot!

I only like authentic asian cuisines and this restaurant should be classified as asian fusion. \n\nFirst of all - This is not a Dim Sum restaurant. Dim Sum is cantonese and XLB are shanghainese. Jiao Zi and XLB is not Dim Sum. (XLB is commonly eaten at dimsum but it is not dim sum. It's Shanghainese) They do serve a weird version of \"har gow\" and a very americanized cha siu bao but those are the only items that can be considered dim sum. \n\nWe shared a number of items between the 4 of us. \n\nShrimp Toast - my friends like this one but I couldn't have it because it contained butter. What chinese restaurant uses butter? -- eek! definitely asian fusion. \nActually all of their dishes are asian fusion. Nothing that authentic. \nPork XLB - this one tasted okay, but they all came with diapers. I know they did this because americans can't pick up a xiao long bao properly with chopsticks, but just no. They also give you red vinegar to go with this dish. No. Pork XLB should be served with black vinegar. -__-\nTom Yum XLB - My friends liked this one too, but I'm born and raised in shanghai and this dish is terrible. \nGiant Bao - this one is the giant XLB that everyone sees in pictures. Ours did not come out looking pretty or tasting great. it was okay. \nXian Jiao Zi (Dumplings) - this was probably my favorite. They serve this like a little floral salad. It's pretty but I like my dumplings without extra olive oil. \nBeijing Noodles - comes with ground pork. It's pretty good, but very oily. \nPork Bao & Cha Siu Bao - both very small compared to other restaurants and nothing special. \n\nPortion sizes for everything were very small. Tasted above average for an americanized dumpling shop, but way way overpriced. Presentation is a novelty and really didn't add much -- sometimes it added negatively like in the case of XLB diapers. \n\nIf you don't eat asian food often and you want pay extra, waiters/waitresses that speak perfect english, plenty of inefficiencies just like a typical american restaurant then come to dumpling time! \nIf you actually want to experience real authentic chinese dumplings at a real chinese restaurant, do yourself a favor and head over to sunset, inner richmond (within SF) or millbrae, Cupertino.

Would I recommend it to someone? Yes. BUT, with disclaimers. It is one of the better dumpling places in the Bay Area, but compared to the other titans. This place would be at the bottom of the list. Koi Palace Shanghai dumpings, in my opinion, are better (and their Siu Mai, plus you have a plethora of choices.) Also, it doesn't come close to Din Tai Fung.

There aren't really any seats around for people waiting, and most people wait outside, so expect to stand for a bit, and don't leave yet -- the food is worth it and it doesn't take too long for the food to get to you once your seated. \n\nSERVICE:\nWe ended up sitting outside, and despite it being a bit windy, it wasn't bad at all since they have 4 (i think) overhead heaters. I was scared that the tables were placed too closely and you could hear each other's conversations, but it actually wasn't, so cheers to that!\n\nNow, onto the delicious BAOSSS: \n**I love that all the dumplings come with their own specialized sauces**\n1) Vegetarian Dumpling (2/5) - Of all of food I got, this was the most beautiful dish. Funny story actually - the dumpling wrap is a deep green spinach wrap, and it was topped with all these beautiful vegetables that the spinach wrap camouflaged with it so I thought I ordered a salad ---until I dug in and realized they were dumplings. Most of the filling were chives, and the skin is on the thicker side, but it was appropriate for this dish. However, I'm personally not too big of a fan of chives, and this dish didn't super stand out for me. The halved cherry tomatoes and slices of radish (?) also didn't really add to the flavor of the dish, only the aesthetics. The sauce was a must to improve the taste of a rather blander tasting dumpling. \n2) Chicken Gyoza (5/5) - I loveeee this dish! There wasn't really any extra dumpling skin like you see with most dumplings, and the skin is a bit more glutinous, though not thaat thick. The filling itself had a lot of texture and wholesomeness with the wood ear mushroom (crunch) and the shiitake mushroom and chicken. The sauce also complimented the dumplings very well, though I probably could have eaten it without it. Only thing I would say is that it wasn't that crispy on the exterior, if that's what really matters to you. \n3) Chicken Bao (4/5) - Their baos are very soft, and the filling was delicious, chicken and wood ear mushroom. However, I wouldn't say it's super wow or anything. \n4) Pork XLB (5/5) - Its not easy to find places that make perfect XLB and this place is no exception - I have a bit of a higher standard for XLB. What I loveee about it is that the skin is thin, filled with plenty of delicious soup with a slight note of ginger, and the flavor of the whole thing is delicious. My only drawbacks are 1) most XLB I've had at traditional places aren't cooked in individualized foil trays, which easily causes the thin skin to rip and precious soup to spill out and 2) the meat was a little too soft for my taste - it kind of broke apart in my mouth rather than for me to chew it down - I like my texture! However, these two drawbacks couldn't bring down my impression of these wonderful juicy XLB. \n5) Trio Bun (4/5) - Again, super soft baos and though very delicious, it didn't have a \"WOW\" factor. The egg custard bun was very similar to what'd you find at dim sum restaurants, the filling being more on the pasty side than the liquidy yolk. The matcha bun had a white filling, with the texture similar to the egg custard bun, but having a great matcha taste.

Most of the tables before us were parties of 2 and the list moved fairly fast. We were seated at 12:45am and were asked what we wanted to order fairly quickly. Left the restaurant at 1:55pm, but could have left at 1:45pm if it wasn't for waiting for the bill. \n\nFOOD\nWanted to order the super big xlb (that you drink with straw) but they ran out already!! Darn.\n-Celery, yuba, peanut salad $5- fresh ingredients and good flavor. Only wished there was more\nShrimp toast $8- most yelpers like and recommend this one. I thought it was good, but I was not wowed.\n-Tom yum goong xlb 6 pc/$9- cool reddish colored xlb. Skin was thin (some parts too thin and it broke!), juicy. Doesn't taste like Tom yum that much, was still worth it to try \n-Pork xlb 6 pc/$9- super juicy and the pork had good flavor, not mushy like other places!! Skin is thin and didn't break as much as Tom yum one. Delicious and the favorite item I had here\n-Seafood gyoza 5pc/$9.5- wow super 'crunchy' but not very flavorful. Reminds me of 'ha gao (shrimp dumpling)' but less flavor. That's why it came with two different sauces, a spicy soy sauce-ish and a butter mayo-ish dipping sauce. \n-Trio of buns- one of each type of dessert bun: beet/taro, green tea/milk, egg/milk 3 pc/$5.5- better than I expected. At first I thought it tasted raw, but maybe it's just the flour taste. The texture is super fluffy and soft. Not too sweet. Good to share.\n\nSERVICE\nService was alright. Most staff are young. We were seated quickly, had to share a table for four with another couple, but that was fine. Waiter came by to take order very fast, even before we were ready. No mistakes with our orders, but there was a long wait until we got our last dish- seafood gyoza. They bring whichever item is ready (regardless of savory or dessert item). Bus boys seem to not have very steady or quick hands. Husband accidentally spilled water on the table and nobody wiped it up for us. So even though the decor is super cute, this place is a spot that's super casual and quick where they try to quickly get as many people in and out. However, it took a while to get our bill and even longer for the waiter to come back to get our credit card. The table next to us saw that it was taking a while so he gave his credit card to the waiter when the waiter picked up our bill and credit card. When about to sign, husband saw that the credit card was not his... it was the other table's. So we gave it to them. When husband got his card, we realized we had the other table's bill. So they charged the card on the wrong bill. It was a $10 difference so I gave the other table a $10 bill. Aiyaaaaa...\n\nDECOR/AMBIANCE\nNot a huge space but brightly lit and comfortable. Larger communal tables in the center. There is a waiting area outside with heaters where you could wait outside and a window from where you can see xlb being made by hand. Noise level is fairly loud but not uncomfortable. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, especially the pork xlb and would come back to try other items like the savory buns, noodles, and the super large xlb. Not recommended for big parties, 4 is max in my opinion. Service could be better, but perhaps that will come with time.

The shrimp toast was essentially shrimp on top of a chinese doughnut served with a spicy mayo sauce. It was good, but I don't think I will order it again. The pork gyoza was the biggest disappointment of the night. There was nothing special about it and the sauce it came with was extremely salty. You will regret ordering it. I don't really like char-siu baos, but lef bf wanted it. He said it was really, really good. He is a bbq pork bun connoisseur. The shrimp har gow would make my ancestors roll in their graves as it had cream cheese in it. It tasted good, and I really like how there were large chunks of shrimp in it.

I was pleasantly surprised by its lack of grease (still more greasy than homemade though) with no sacrifice in flavor. I appreciated that the \"pan fried\" element was a quick sear to the bottom rather than a deeply brown and crunchy affair, allowing you to really taste the dumpling for what it is (rather than just the base deliciousness of thoroughly fried food).\n- Pork Char-Siu Bao: Peanut butter... I had my doubts. But it was excellent! The bun was nice and fluffy, the pork was flavorful and not too fatty. I am still not a huge fan of peanut intruding in my BBQ goodness, but I appreciate the effort to innovate \n- Shrimp & Cilantro Har Gow: Would just go regular shrimp next time. This is another oldie but goodie for a reason. As a cilantro lover (not a soap taster), I found the cilantro too overpowering for the shrimp. It has a strong foreflavor, blocking out all the fragrant foreflavor of the shrimp and leaving that oceanic aftertaste I tolerate when eating shrimp.\n- Xi 'An Vegetarian Dumpling: Tested this for vegetarian friends, and it is go!

And by executed, it looked like they received a death sentence. \n\nOverall this place has promise, but the chefs need to tighten up on some of the cooking times and food presentations. \n\nWERKIN'\n+ Pleasant hostess and waitstaff\n+ Food delivered quickly\n+ Nice big tables for groups\n+  Garlicky green bean flavor was great, but see below...\n+ Char-Siu Bao was yummy with the peanut butter\n+ Beijing noodles were tasty and fairly chewy (though could be a bit chewier)\n+ Pork XLB was very good\n+ Tom Yum Goong was incredibly delicious, and the reason I'd return. Soup was a great temperature, and had a nice spicy kick. Lots of flavor. \n+ Pork Gyoza was decent. Nothing to write home about.\n+ Seafood Gyoza was really good. Lots of flavors and a great dipping sauce. \n\nNEEDS WORK\n- Garlicky green beans were cooked a bit too long. I like them snappy. Great flavor though!\n- Expensive, but yeah... SOMA\n- The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are served in a tin cup, and as other reviewers have pointed out, chances are that the tin cup will tear the skin when trying to extract the dumpling. This happened to 2/3 of my dumplings. PLEASE don't serve them in these tins.\n- Egg yolk bun was overcooked resulting in a fully cooked yolk. I mentioned this to the server as I ordered a second serving. The second egg yolk bun was just as overcooked as the first.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["We also had the pork xlb, they were nice and juicy.

There was 2 groups of 2 infront and I wrote my name down on the waiting list. The hostess 2as already seating the first party and checked the list after. So the second party didn't wrote their name down but I let them get seated first. There was more tables open and it wouldn't of made a difference. We got seated at the patio but there was no settings ready so the hostess went to grab them and then she forgot the menus. We sat for about 5 mins before the server came with water then I asked for the menu and he quickly went to get it and apologized. (He was very aplogoectic even though it was not his fault) another 5mins passed and we were ready to order but the waitress asked if we could move to another table and so she can seat a party of 5. I didn't mind so we agreed. The first what! The party didn't want to sit in the patio! Then she and her group decided the patio was ok. So we moved and they sat... Haha and next! They moved the 2 tables that were set up for them to connect with another! OMG! (Super irritated at these 5). Then after they sat for about 5 minutes and drank their water, they requested to move inside instead! Holy cow! This has nothing to do with the restaurant but I just wanted to say that the hostess handled herself very well handling this group!\n\nWe ordered everything we wanted and they had everything plus added new items since they opened (or the last I was here.)\n\nSeared chicken bao, pork xlb, 2 king dum, xi An Pork duMplings and clinatro har gow.\n\nFirst was the XiAn Pork Dumpling: Plating is nicely done but the garnishes didn't help add flavor to the Dumpling. I tried it without sauces first and it did lack flavor. \n\nSecond pork xlb : none of them broke! (Thank you !!!) The thickness of the skin was inconsistent. I had one that was super thick then 2 that were not. I wish there was more Juice in them (doesn't everyone ). The meat flavor was ok. One of them was super ginger-y.\n\nThird clinatro Har Gow: I expected the skin to be thinner but I have seen thicker. The taste is ok but it does come with a clinatro sauce which I good BUT if your food is flavored right... Why would I need to use the clinatro sauce? Just my thoughts !\n\nForth was the seared chicken bao: I like the bao. A lot and I don't eat bao. The meat is not juicy and I think there a way too much mushroom inside . Also for a seared bao, they outside of the bun is overly moist. Which makes it stick to your fingers.\n\nFifth : king Dum (king xlb) literally ordered it for the gram. Takes the longest... We ate everything and it still wasn't here....And tun tun tun... After 40mins it's sold out! Wtf! Waiter said it was system miscount. Haha sold out right before we ordered ... I don't think so buddy!\n\nReview stays the same 3 stars.\n\n\n**********************************************************\ncame here when they first open about 8pm and they were basically sold out of most items already.

After waiting for so long, my friends and I were excited to try their large XLB (the one that's so big you need a straw), but they were sold out!! We started with the shrimp toast, which is like a youtiao topped with a shrimp paste. I'm not sure if it was because we were starving, but we really enjoyed it. It was perfectly savory and the two different textures worked really well together. We also had their garlicky green beans which was very typical Chinese styled green beans, not all that special. Next came our pork bao that we requested to be pan fried. This was just a typical Chinese pork bun with lettuce and other vegetables. It wasn't all that special. We moved onto the two types of XLB- pork XLB and tom yum goong XLB. While both were filled with savory soups, we preferred the pork XLB over the tom yum goong XLB since it had less of a vinegry taste to it. The tom yum XLB wasn't spicy or sour like the soup usually is. Topped with meat and some ginger, the Beijing noodles were also pretty delicious, but it was definitely not enough to share for the 3 of us.
