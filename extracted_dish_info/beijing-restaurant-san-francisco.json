Presentation wise, it was good. The bowl of al dente noodles was separate from the bowl of sauce and steamed bean sprouts, and cucumbers. She mixed it for us, dumping all of it in. Honestly, I didn't like the bean sauce. At least not this version. I've had other Zha Jiang Mian and Beijing style is not to my fancy. This was more fermented bean taste and savory with no sweetness.

We ordered the following-\n\nLarge hot and sour soup\nPot stickers\nBeef pancakes\nChicken chow fun\nMongolian beef\nSteamed rice\n\nTotal was $37, but could have easily served 4 or or 5 people. Katie H. and I got three meals out of it. The large hot and sour soup was about double the quantity I was expecting. Definitely a good value. And we were pleasantly surprised by the quality. The stand-out dishes for me were pot stickers and pancakes but everything hit the spot. Definitely at least on par with Yummy House, with a much bigger menu and an actual restaurant if you feel like dining in. They also have lunch specials for $5.50 which looked pretty good. (The lunch specials at Yummy House have always been a disappointment).\n\nI definitely look forward to eating here again and exploring the rest of the menu. Welcome to the neighborhood, Beijing Restaurant!\n\nUpdate 12/11/09:\n\nWent back for seconds and ordered the following for delivery:\n\nLg. Hot and Sour Soup\nBeijing Beef Pancake\nMu Shu Chicken\nBeijing Noodles in Special Sauce\nBeef with Green Onion\nNapa w/ Pork Dumpling\nCrab Cheese Puffs\nSteamed Rice\n\nTotal was $56 + change. Nothing particularly wowed us this time. The napa/pork dumpling is basically a pot sticker, maybe slightly smaller, but more to an order. Crab cheese puffs were pretty standard. Beef w/ green onion was basically mongolian beef without white onions.\n\nThe only truly \"new\" dishes that we ordered were therefore the mu shu chicken and the beijing noodles in special sauce. The former was pretty good, although a little light on chicken and heavy on cabbage and other filler. I did not enjoy the beijing noodles- the noodles themselves were OK but the sauce was overly salty. Basically, the dish consists of thick, udon-like noodles in salty brown sauce with bean sprouts, celery and eggplant. Seemed like kind of a rip for $7.25, the most expensive noodle dish on the menu. Not nearly as good as the chow fun.\n\nDelivery was pretty prompt at prime time  on Friday night but the delivery man claimed not to have change. Not a big deal but something to keep in mind in the future.\n\nEverything was pretty good except for the beijing noodles, which I wouldn't order again.

This is the first time I've seen such a highly rated place occupy this very location. All of the others seemed to be American fare Chinese food places.\n\nI was surprised when my brother showed me the to go menu the other day and said the place was actually good. He'd been trying their lunch menu and had nothing but good things to say about it. And of course he tried the 2 things I would have liked to have tried: the Mongolian Beef and the Double Mushroom Chicken. The two things he said that made me want to try this place is that they used fresh veggies. THere were NO canned straw mushrooms inthe double mushroom chicken and they make their own noodles. Okay let's give it a shot.\n\nHe wanted to actually just do pick up and order in but he misplaced his to go menu so we drove over for an early Friday night dinner. He had actually driven by the night before with his friend in the hopes of having some soup but there were no parking spaces to be found within a 2 block radius and when they drove past they noticed every table occupied as well as the waiting area quite full.\n\nOn our early Friday night dinner, there were 2 tables occupied and a few people waiting for pick up. Very small dining room. I was curious to see how they set up the dining room in the first place, remember this used to be HS Salt. Lol.\n\nAnd YES there are a plethora of random photos adorning their walls. What did we order? The beef chow fun, the general tso's chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and the Beijing beef pancake. \n\nThe chow fun was great. Great flavor. Very fresh. And piping hot. The mistake we made was ordering 2 dishes that were very similar but we weren't sure how hot the GT chicken was going to be and we had my kids with us. Well both chicken dishes were very similar and really uneventful. The pancake was just okay to me, I think it needed some sort of sauce or something? Soy and vinegar? \n\nMy brother and I both agreed that maybe we needed to order something else b/c this visit was just ok.

Even Yao Ming (the Houston Rockets basketball legend) loved this place and has been on record as saying \"it's one of his favorite places to eat when he comes to San Francisco.\"\n\nEach dish is packed with big flavors and the menu itself, offers so many options to choose from. In fact the current menu has about eight pages worth of delicious food. I personally loved the: long beans, a curry style chow mein, the crispy onion pancake and of course the steamed pork dumplings. The long beans were fried just right and the pepper sauce that's coated on those beans takes the dish to new heights.

Add eggs and cuts of sausage, that's married together in spices. \n\nThe onion cake was cooked to perfection. Unlike most places that keep it drenched in cooking oil. It was the best combination of airy and crispy and cooked to perfection. Although it was good it missed a salty element like hoisin sauce to compliment it. Instead of getting it, Thats when the frustration began to set in. Our table had continuously asked for hoisin sauce or something to use as a dipping sauce. We were told numerous times they were getting it for us. But fifteen minutes later and after asking the staff members numerous times. we were finally told they don't carry any. That kinda served was the theme throughout the meal. Plates of food were slammed down on our dining table. When we were giving our order, the waiter was real short and seemed annoyed. Like we did something wrong by wanting to eat there. Asking for things like hoisin and water was a chore and became frustrating. \n\nNow I will say it could've been because it was busy. Because when I asked why was it like that. it was made clear the main focus should always be on the foods an not the service. So the service is just secondary I guess. Anyhow I say that as a warning so people aren't turned off by it. So once again the Restuarant is very small so you will feel like people are sitting and eating right on top of you.

The texture of the noodle is actually very interesting because it looks like \"Ho Fun\" (Thick rice noodle) but when you bite it the texture tastes kind of like jello. I think it tastes okay, but I'm not a fan. Even though they mix it in the sauce it seems that the flavor of the sauce can't really seep into the food therefore you can't really taste it.\n\nFor me I think the food here was all lacking in flavor which was disappointing because in the Chinese culture the flavors are suppose to be very bold and strong.

The BeiJing food is very authentic.

They need the customer base from the people work and live near by, which are mostly American and Mexican. These items tend to be a little salty, not as authentic, but still good. So, when you are there, try things on the main menu, and ask for suggestions.\nTip: For those who expect Cantonese food, don't go there.

Apparently it's a Beijing favorite\n\nThe menu has lots of other interesting dishes on it, including flour ball dishes (meaning dishes with dumplings), and lots of Beijing specialties as well as many more traditional Chinese restaurant dishes.  They do a very inexpensive lunch as well.\n\nI hope Yelpers will check it out and help these guys get off the ground.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-01-24"}], "steam house special baozi": [{"excerpts": ["The steam house special baozi is like small sized steam buns.

My wife and I ordered four items:\n\n1) Beijing noodles with special sauce (Beijing zha jiang mian). I've had this in Beijing (where there are places that specialize in this one dish) and this is identical in style and pretty competitive in quality. As others have noted, the Beijing version of this is not quite the same flavor as Korean za zang noodles; the sauce is a bit saltier and has meat, and there are veggies to mix in as well. The noodles are freshly handmade and it's obvious from the texture.\n\n2) Beijing vegetable pie (jiu cai su hezi). Paper-thin pancakes wrapped around a filling of green onions, tofu, and some other vegetables. Beware: this contains dried shrimp, so if you're allergic, best to avoid it. But if you're not, you'll appreciate the rich savory flavor and the fact that, although it's obviously fried, it doesn't come out at all oily.\n\n3) Steam house special baozi (xiao long zheng bao). This was nothing too exceptional: it's a bun with a pork and vegetable meatball inside. They will warn you ahead of time not to expect a Shanghai-style xiao long bao (the kind with the paper-thin skin) -- this is a full-fledged bun. I may not sound super-enthusiastic but I'd probably order it again; it's a simple dish executed well.\n\n4) Spicy bean curd beef (lazi xiang gan niu rou). If you've had Hunan xiao chao, this is similar, strips of bean curd and slices of beef stir-fried together. But it also has strips of crunchy bell pepper and other vegetables that provide a more varied mouth feel. Despite the name it's not particularly spicy.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely go back next time I was in that part of San Francisco with a hankering for Chinese food.

The texture of the noodle is actually very interesting because it looks like \"Ho Fun\" (Thick rice noodle) but when you bite it the texture tastes kind of like jello. I think it tastes okay, but I'm not a fan. Even though they mix it in the sauce it seems that the flavor of the sauce can't really seep into the food therefore you can't really taste it.\n\nFor me I think the food here was all lacking in flavor which was disappointing because in the Chinese culture the flavors are suppose to be very bold and strong.

The pork was tender and flavorful and the bean sprouts added a nice fresh crisp to the dish.\n\n*House Special Steamed Meatball ($9.95): GOOD!

They do have traditional American style grub but you can get that anywhere.\n\nThe meatballs are high in starch, chewy, and very subtle in flavor.  The balls get a quick fry then are \"re-hydrated\" in sauce (ie tossed in a wok w/sauce).  The result is a savory, chewy meatball that is not like anything you will find at an Italian restaurant.  I love them and think it is worth a shot for anyone with an adventurous palate.\n\nStir fried flour balls are the Han version of gnocchi.  They're smaller chewier and bathed in Chinese flavors.\n\nThe dumplings are made fresh and available all day.  I go in at 11pm and there are still dumplings to be had and they always taste delicious.  I have tried them all and I love every single one of them.  Very subtle fresh flavor.\n\nI have to reiterate that this food is subtle in flavor.  It is not over the top like \"American\" style or Sichuan  cuisine.  There are many styles of food on the menu so there is something for everyone but if you want an authentic taste of Northern/Beijing cuisine stick to the house specialties.  \n\nThe cumin lamb is good: chewy, dry fried lamb with bell peppers stir fried together.\nThe noodles with brown sauce are glutinous, savory, and mild.  The cornstarch thickened broth has a viscous character to it but the mild, savory flavor paired with the chewy noodles really attracted my attention.  \nThe Beijing noodles have cold crunchy vegetables with black bean paste and hot noodles.  The ingredients are tossed table side and give you and cold/warm, crunchy/chewy sensation when you're eating it.\nThe garlicky pea shoots are always tasty and a good way to inject some vegetables into your meal.\nThe liver and vegetables is good if you like a strong irony, metallic, liver flavor and crunchy savory bell pepper.  Offal fans may like this dish.\nThe pancakes are awesome and the scallion/green onion will appeal to authentic/American style fans alike.  The cake is thick, flufy, doughy and packed with subtle oniony flavor.\nThe vegetable pancake is so tasty and chewy it should not be missed.\nThe stirred fried beef and tofu is also tasty.\n\nNever had anything from here I did not like.  Please try the Chinese lager they have here it pairs well with the food and is pretty reasonable in price (for the large 24oz bottle).\n\nI love this restaurant.  The food comes out as it is prepared so if you have a problem with that tell you server (ie mains before apps).  The younger guys that work at night (when I go in) may not be polished servers but they are friendly and willing to help you understand what you are eating.  Did I mention they cook until 1:30a and stay open till 2a!

The noodles are freshly handmade and it's obvious from the texture.\n\n2) Beijing vegetable pie (jiu cai su hezi). Paper-thin pancakes wrapped around a filling of green onions, tofu, and some other vegetables. Beware: this contains dried shrimp, so if you're allergic, best to avoid it. But if you're not, you'll appreciate the rich savory flavor and the fact that, although it's obviously fried, it doesn't come out at all oily.\n\n3) Steam house special baozi (xiao long zheng bao). This was nothing too exceptional: it's a bun with a pork and vegetable meatball inside. They will warn you ahead of time not to expect a Shanghai-style xiao long bao (the kind with the paper-thin skin) -- this is a full-fledged bun. I may not sound super-enthusiastic but I'd probably order it again; it's a simple dish executed well.\n\n4) Spicy bean curd beef (lazi xiang gan niu rou). If you've had Hunan xiao chao, this is similar, strips of bean curd and slices of beef stir-fried together. But it also has strips of crunchy bell pepper and other vegetables that provide a more varied mouth feel. Despite the name it's not particularly spicy.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely go back next time I was in that part of San Francisco with a hankering for Chinese food. Definitely reminds me of the food at the mom-and-pop places I like to frequent when I'm in China.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-05-02"}], "house special hot chicken wings": [{"excerpts": ["House Special Hot Chicken Wings (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/EU38hA8fVl4pLn1yXJ2IgQ/l) - These crispy fried chicken wings are very good with a nice outer crust and juicy meat on the inside.

I first tried some menu items from this restaurant back in June, and I've become a regular customer since, but only recently have I actually sat inside the restaurant to eat.\n\nThe restaurant space is fairly small.  Hundreds of photographs adorn the walls and if you've read some of the other reviews you'll probably already know that basketball star Yao Ming is featured on several of them.  The service is excellent, and honestly, when was the last time you heard that about a casual, inexpensive Chinese restaurant in the City?  They have their own parking lot too, and they deliver to the neighborhood.  They even deliver for free if your food total hits the $15 minimum.\n\nI've stuck to the House Specials, the hand pulled noodles and the Beijing dim sum for the most part.  I think the only dish I've ordered not listed under those three categories was a beef chow fun, and I've had that at least three times.  Here are some of the items I've tried when I've dined at the restaurant.\n\nHouse Special Steamed Baozi (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/OagR2JyL-nSm1oBYQ1O1hw/l) and (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ljnVUENOs0WR-U4YELdChw/l) - These are little steamed buns with a lean pork and chopped Chinese greens filling.  They're not soupy like xiao lung baos, and the outer bun is quite thin.  These are quite good but only when they're hot.\n\nThree Flavor Dumplings (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/_lbwwg7dJWwJl_UEmiHz2A/l) and (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/5LgcTqh7dnz3525Tk5cuuw/l) - These are my favorite steamed dumplings here.  They're packed with a juicy mixture of ground pork, ground chicken, shrimp and chopped chives.\n\nBeef Stew Noodle Soup (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a-IzRHuhtOzz4FRrEUV1Pg/l) - I love their hand pulled noodles which are less doughy than some and always seems to have the exact same chewy consistency and texture.  The beef stew has a good mix of meaty pieces, pieces with tendons and tender Shanghai bok choy.  I'm not a big fan of the dark brown broth though because I think it lacks depth.\n\nPreserved Vegetable Shredded Pork Noodle Soup (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/qkiy-6GpgCJEX8LXLgOB-w/l) - This is easily my favorite of the soup noodles here.  I often have the spicy preserved vegetables with pork over rice at home, so this selection is very homey to me.  The vegetables and pork are stir fried then served on top of the handmade noodles and chicken broth.  I love the little splash of sesame oil to finish the stir fry.  It just taste so good!  The broth in this dish is usually perfectly seasoned for me.\n\nBeef Chow Fun (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/GLnj-MVDPlzLzfgO1q5tTw/l) - I learned about good wok hay at a very young age.  Wok hay in Cantonese often refers to foods cooked perfectly in a wok with a nice seared flavor locked into the ingredients.  The fried beef in Beijing's beef chow fun has a beautiful crust on nearly each piece of meat sizzled to near perfection.  They go really easy on the bean sprouts and the onions too meaning I get more chewy rice noodles than I do inexpensive fillers.\n\nHouse Special Hot Chicken Wings (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/EU38hA8fVl4pLn1yXJ2IgQ/l) - These crispy fried chicken wings are very good with a nice outer crust and juicy meat on the inside.  Mixed in a saute of green onion, white onion, cilantro and dry red chiles the flavor had absolutely no spicyness to it however.  Perhaps had they broken the meat of the chiles that would have helped.  If you want good chicken wings these are very good.  If you want good, spicy chicken wings then these are definitely disappointing.\n\nOverall I'd give a 4.5, but for hand-pulled noodles and flavorful dumplings delivered to my front door I've got nothing but 5 star love for Beijing Restaurant.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-09-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Jing dong meat pancake \nEgg plant with spicy garlic sauce\nBeijing noodles with special sauce \nBBQ pork fried rice \nHouse special hot chicken wings 2 \nCumin beef\n\n", "The only two dishes I would recommend ordering out of the above, is the eggplant dish and the cumin beef. \n\n", "The only two dishes I would recommend ordering out of the above, is the eggplant dish and the cumin beef. \n\n"], "author": "Chanel L.", "review": "Ordered takeout for 4.

But, if it's good enough for Yao Ming, it's good enough for me!\n\nMy friend and I came here for dinner on Sunday, August 29th at 5:15ish. As you can tell, I'm a bit behind on my reviews. :X\n\nBeijing is quite small with several tables to accommodate a party of four, and then a large rectangular table in the back to accommodate 16. Since we came early enough, we were promptly seated. \n\nFOOD:\nBR serves up Northern Chinese Cuisine meaning you will find dishes with Szechuan and Shanghai influences that many other Chinese restaurants in the city won't have.  \n\nIf you're on a diet, make sure to ask how the dishes are cooked b/c some of the dishes are fried when I thought it would be braised or steamed.\n\n*Sizzling Seafood Rice Soup ($5.95): YUM! The soup was very comforting; the broth was rich and flavorful as opposed to being salty. The scallops, calamari, and shrimp were fresh, sweet, and tender. The sizzling rice is like rice crispies that are placed on the soup upon serving which give it a nice texture contrast.\n\n*Cumin Lamb ($9.95): VERY GOOD! The lamb was stir fried to a perfect tenderness and wasn't too gamey. The cumin flavor was very prominent which was slightly bitter and nutty, while the peppercorns added a strong kick.\n\n*Ground Bean Sheet w/ Pork ($7.95):YUM! This is basically a rendition of chow fun (wet). The bean sheets are like clear chow fun noodles which were tender w/ a bite. The pork was tender and flavorful and the bean sprouts added a nice fresh crisp to the dish.\n\n*House Special Steamed Meatball ($9.95): GOOD! These meatballs are basically lion head meatballs which is a hearty comfort food for me. The fist-sized meatballs were soft, tender, full of flavor; salty, savory, and sweet from the white/black pepper, soy, ginger, and scallions.\n \n*Egg Surface Tofu ($8.95): OK. I thought the tofu would be steamed or braised since it would be topped w/ an egg white sauce. However, it was fried. Aside from the misunderstanding, the tofu was soft, tender and the runny egg white sauce added creaminess to the tofu.\n\nSERVICE:\nEfficient and prompt, however, there was a slight language barrier. My friend can't eat fish and the Sizzling Rice Soup came w/ fish, so it took some explaining and hand gestures to the waiters. \n\nOverall Beijing is the real deal when it comes to Northern Chinese Cuisine.

Beware if you have seafood allergies - fish, imitation crab, squid, clams and shrimp are included in the broth.  I'm allergic to fish and they were extremely nice to redo the soup for me without fish in the broth since I didn't know fish would be in the soup.\n\n*Cumin Lamb ($9.95) - YUM!  Thin slices of lamb are cooked with a variety of spices, bell peppers, and onions.  Be careful, the spices add a good kick to the dish.\n\n*House Special Steam Meat Ball ($9.95, 4 pieces) - It was okay.  We figured this was similar to lionhead meatballs, which it sort of is.  Medium size pan fried meatballs are served on lettuce leaves with a thick sauce and green onions on top.  \n\n*Egg Surface Tofu ($8.95) - Good.  We didn't know what the dish was and asked the waiter who told us an egg sauce was placed on top of the tofu.  When the dish came out, it was deep fried tofu pieces with a thick light brown sauce.  Although I don't know where the egg was in this dish, it was still good where the tofu was perfectly deep fried and the sauce gave it a bit more flavor.\n\n*Pork with Ground Bean Sheet ($7.95) - YUMMY!!

While it wasn't overly spicy, the tender morsels of Lamb came coated in both cumin and crushed red peppers, which provided an explosive counterpart to the slightly gamey flavor of the exceptionally juicy, not overly greasy lamb, shocking my palate with an intense burst of flavors after every bite. When combined with the crunchy onions and green peppers that garnish the dish, what results is a unique flavor and textural profile miles away from the over-sauced, saccharine sweet examples of Chinese Cuisine I grew up on.\n\nFor appetizers, we shared some excellent Crab and Cream Cheese Puffs (5.25), which featured excellent fillo dough and remarkably delicate crab.

I ordered the Yelp recommendations but also asked the waitress/co-owner for recommendations. She said a soup or warm clay pot would complement our selections.  She recommended the Sliced Fish with preserved vegetables warm pot.  It was an excellent recommendation as it turned out to be my favorite dish here. To the food:\n\n* Sliced Fish with Preserved Vegetables Warm Pot:  This was the best dish, tasty and contained generous slices of rock cod, homemade preserved vegetables, clear noodles, and topped with fresh cilantro.  Nicely served on a stand with small sterno-type chafing fuel to keep the pot warm. (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/8n4gMrljNwpFd6j3-dehOQ/l)\n\n* Cumin Lamb:  This dish was very tasty, generous amount of cumin seeds and lamb which were stir fried with green peppers and onions.  Very flavorful and surprisingly minimal amount of oil.

I've had this in Beijing (where there are places that specialize in this one dish) and this is identical in style and pretty competitive in quality.

Paper-thin pancakes wrapped around a filling of green onions, tofu, and some other vegetables. Beware: this contains dried shrimp, so if you're allergic, best to avoid it. But if you're not, you'll appreciate the rich savory flavor and the fact that, although it's obviously fried, it doesn't come out at all oily.\n\n3) Steam house special baozi (xiao long zheng bao). This was nothing too exceptional: it's a bun with a pork and vegetable meatball inside. They will warn you ahead of time not to expect a Shanghai-style xiao long bao (the kind with the paper-thin skin) -- this is a full-fledged bun. I may not sound super-enthusiastic but I'd probably order it again; it's a simple dish executed well.\n\n4) Spicy bean curd beef (lazi xiang gan niu rou). If you've had Hunan xiao chao, this is similar, strips of bean curd and slices of beef stir-fried together. But it also has strips of crunchy bell pepper and other vegetables that provide a more varied mouth feel.

Some hardcore culinary kung fuud indeed.\n\nRE$PECT\n\nSF may have the legendary Old Mandarin Islamic on Vicente, but that's a niche of Northern Islamic Chinese (no pork) and you really only should go there for the hot pots and chin dribbling greasy beef pancake. \n\nBeijing Restaurant offers something that's more down home, less flashy (similar to Everyday Beijing in San Mateo) but truly hits da $pot.\n\nGet the \"warm pots\" (sa guo), which are actually super piping hot contrary to the translation. Think of them as lesser refined Northern Chinese \"nabemono\", but will surely do wonders. \n\nThe star of the warm pots is the key ingredient, sour/preserved/pickled napa cabbage (suan bai tsai). When paired with the right meats, it is an unbeatable combination that is perfect for cold weather. In NE China (dongbei), suan tsai bai rou (last 2 words = white meat = belly bacon = belly good) is probably the definitive comfort food. \n\nAt Beijing Restaurant, the highly recommended item from the warm pots selection is #27 \"Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot\" or really \"Suan Tsai Yu Pien Sa Guo\" which is an easy 5 stars (provided you are not put off by sour cabbage, it is as strong as the kind at Old Islamic Mandarin). The sour cabbage has the positive effect of cutting down the fat and oils from the fatty meats (especially the belly bacon) so you don't feel so dirty, yet it nurtures and soothes (and lubes) going down, while working its way through your convoluted inner pipes. The fish used in #27 is a type of cod, and is super delicious, poached to the right texture, retaining flavor and bite. These guys have it down. In addition to the sour green goodness and scrumptious fish, the application of mung bean wide noodles (fen pi) worked out way better than their thinner bean thread vermicelli counterparts (fen si) served in other sour cabbage pots, an excellent detail. Worthy of applause.\n\nIncredible in house hand made noodles, and an extremely well executed #91 beef noodle soup (the clear broth rendition), Tsing Tang Niu Rou Mien, where they actually properly stewed slices of beef shank with the criss cross cut tendon, and not using brisket cuts like other Northern or non-Canto joints in town. Even the clear broth was great. The beef stew noodles soup did look REALLY good, although that will be on the to-try next time.\n\nPork and cabbage dumplings.....sadly this is not their forte. The texture was good, but the content was overly marinated and seasoned, which no amount of white pepper or black vinegar could do much to help. This is where San Tung and Kingdom of Dumpling holds an edge.

The menu's quite extensive, but we followed recommendations and tried to keep towards the Beijing dishes. The food:\n\n#26 Slice Fish with Preserved Vegetable in Warm Pot: Delicious. Normally I'm not particularly inclined towards fish soup or preserved vegetables, but I'd love to have this again, especially during cold weather. The mild white fish contrasts very well to the sharp taste of preserved vegetables, and the broth is tasty without being too heavy. The noodles were hard for me to eat, but that's my problem.\n\n#54 Beijing Beef Pancake - my favorite, 'cause how could it not be? There's a pretty thin layer of delicious beef between wonderful layers of soft, but crispy on the outside, \"pancake.\" I can't offer the most accurate comparison of what other culture's bread-like, meat-stuffed thing this is, but it's pretty much perfect.\n\n#66 Stired Flour Ball with Pork - probably my least favorite, although still pretty tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect with the flour balls, but they had the texture of slightly undercooked pasta, which is not bad in and of itself, but I kind of associate it negatively with the pasta. The flavors were good though.\n\n#91 Beijing Style Noodles with Brown Paste - We asked for a recommendation between this and the Beijing Noodles with Special Sauce. We were told the \"special sauce\" one was \"dry,\" while the brown paste was wet. I was a bit wary of the special sauce after hearing it was salty, so we went with brown paste - which definitely was \"wet,\" somewhere in between a soup and heavy sauce consistency. I liked the noodles, and the sauce was tasty, but a little bland. We had tons of leftovers, and I think I'll add a lot of vegetables to absorb some of the sauce. \n\nThe meal came to $33 without tip and would have very easily been enough food for 4 people. We were told the delivery radius is 2 miles.

Disappointment :-(   (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=C1zRokrBTWC8pxxBQbMuMw)\n- Egg rolls: These were crisp and tasty. But their sweet and sour dipping sauce was too watery and had too much vinegar in it, which ruined it a bit for me. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=yCh7hIXx3ZptHL3R7fJnLw)\n- Prawns in spicy garlic sauce: Served on a bed of steamed brocolli. Unfortunately there was mostly brocolli and not many prawns, and there were too many onions slathered on top. And the sauce wasn't even spicy garlic, it was vinegary-tasting and watery, much like the sweet and sour sauce. Disappointment again. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=1t7t8bdluQNwcEG_SV1Bvw)\n- Shrimp fried rice: Okay, it's getting a bit better. The carrot, green onion and peas were fresh and the egg was fluffy. Too bad they only put like 9 shrimp in it. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=c3vLke1FlZlijMNZLW4AKw)\n- Beef chow mein: Finally, a winner! Flavorful, not overly salty, not overfried, the beef was tender, and they had the right amount of onions/green onions without overtaking the dish. Loved this. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8sTqr9ehaZuqORQCddYeUg?select=7A6s7ZpcTTQzjeM1f4eAWA)\n- Also, my water was served at room temperature with no ice in it. I feel like I'm complaining alot, but if you look at my reviews, I usually don't. So when I do, I think it's justified.\n\nFood: 3.5 stars. \nHit-or-miss, but mostly miss on my visit. On a positive note, the food is much less greasy than at other Chinese restaurants.\n\nService: 2 stars. \nOur server disappeared after he took our order. He also didn't pack our leftovers like other Chinese restaurants do - he just dropped off the boxes and walked off. So I packed the food myself and made a mental note: \"Service is two stars.\"\n\nValue: 4 stars. \nPortions are much smaller than at other Chinese restaurants, but the food is also less greasy. So that's a pretty good tradeoff.\n\nOverall: 3 stars.\nMy quest to find a great Chinese restaurant in SF continues.

The soup was very comforting; the broth was rich and flavorful as opposed to being salty. The scallops, calamari, and shrimp were fresh, sweet, and tender. The sizzling rice is like rice crispies that are placed on the soup upon serving which give it a nice texture contrast.\n\n*Cumin Lamb ($9.95): VERY GOOD!

The cumin flavor was very prominent which was slightly bitter and nutty, while the peppercorns added a strong kick.\n\n*Ground Bean Sheet w/ Pork ($7.95):YUM! This is basically a rendition of chow fun (wet). The bean sheets are like clear chow fun noodles which were tender w/ a bite. The pork was tender and flavorful and the bean sprouts added a nice fresh crisp to the dish.\n\n*House Special Steamed Meatball ($9.95): GOOD!

I thought the tofu would be steamed or braised since it would be topped w/ an egg white sauce. However, it was fried. Aside from the misunderstanding, the tofu was soft, tender and the runny egg white sauce added creaminess to the tofu.\n\nSERVICE:\nEfficient and prompt, however, there was a slight language barrier.
