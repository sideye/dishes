Excellent food, pleasant ambiance and solid attentive service.  In their new location, the food is just as delicious but the service and decor need work.  The decor is more suited to a casual diner or cafe.  Our table was too small to hold the various dishes we ordered without shuffling glasses and plates around.

Our waiter, while he was nice and made very good food and wine recommendations, clearly needs more training.  \n\nDespite these hiccups, the food was absolutely terrific.

We got our grilled eggplant quickly and it was great with the bread. \n\nFood was BOMB. BF got the Paglia e Fieno Alfredo and it was FRESH as F. The server explained that it's fresh pasta but they don't make it in house. I got the spinach gnocchi because it was the only one with a red creamy sauce. I later overheard the server telling another table that you can do a lot of mixing and matching with sauces and pasta - good to know. The gnocchi is made fresh from scratch in house and it tasted like it. Creamy tomato sauce had the right amount of creaminess and tang. But I'm not gonna lie, the bf's pasta was waaaayy better. That's what I'm getting next time :) \n\nHad Tiramisu for dessert. Yummy but nothing to write home about. We were in and out in an hour or so.
