Entrees: chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, tandoori chicken with boti, side of rice and naan. Dessert: kheer\" for $42. \n\nWe got four meals out of it! The entrees didn't have very much protein in them, but to be fair it was supposed to be for two meals. The naan came a little tough but I bet if we had it fresh at the restaurant it would have been better. It also came with a variety of dipping sauces which were fun to try and all tasty.\n\nThis was a fun way to try out multiple dishes from a new restaurant at a great price.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["I loved the kheer for desert.

That is when we decided to try out this little gem.\n\nInteriors were nice and clean. We got the vegetarian thali which was basically a three course meal for two. It consisted of samosas for starter, followed by Saag paneer and Dal makhani served with butter naan and rice. I loved the kheer for desert. Would recommend. Also got sweet lassi which was ok.\n\nOverall good service and solid food at a decent price point (under $50 for 2)", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-05-07"}], "kulfi": [{"excerpts": ["Mango kulfi.\n"], "author": "Phani C.", "review": "First thing that attracted me is the name then the ambience while coming to the main stream of any particular restaurant is \"FOOD\" because,with out great flavour or the special essence the ambience or the name doesn't make any magic....\nAmazed by their hospitality and the food tastes beyond awesome,small place with great taste love it.\n\n1.
