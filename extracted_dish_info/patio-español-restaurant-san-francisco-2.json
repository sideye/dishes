"], "author": "Gourmet Princessa L.", "review": "THE WORST TAPAS I'VE EVER HAD!! - is how I would describe this Basque restaurant in Outer Mission. Before I go on to tell you my nightmare experience at this restaurant, you should know that I've been to Spain and had plenty of amazing tapas. \n\nOn a quest to search for a backup venue for an event in 2013 as the Basque Cultural Center in SSF wasn't available, a friend told us about the banquet space at El Patio Espanor. So tonight my family and I went there to check out the space and also taste some food. Little did we know, it was the worst meal we've ever eaten. \n\nWe wanted to taste several tapas so we ordered 4 standard tapas dishes that we had both in Spain and also in other tapas restaurants in town so we can have a benchmark to go with:  \n\nTapas Del Dia - Scallop cooked in garlic, white wine sauce and Serrano jam. Mediocre dish. \n\nGambas Al Ajillo - Shrimps cooked in garlic and tomato sauce. This was ok, the shrimps were good size, but nothing exciting to write home about. \n\nWild Mushrooms with Garlic and wine sauce - this was by far the WORST dish we had. First, the mushroom was wrong. The cook used fresh shitake mushrooms that they probably bought from the Chinese grocery store Pacific Super right next door. It wasn't porcini or even regular boring white button mushroom would have been better. All the mushrooms were drenched in the same garlic white wine sauce, same taste as the scallops and shrimp dishes. Completely weird tasting as shitake mushrooms have a more woody flavor and the texture when cooked in the white, gummy, starchy sauce just gave it a terrible texture. It was disgusting. \n\nTortilla Espanola - when this dish arrived, the server told us is American omelet. Um...hello, was the name this dish Tortilla Espanola? Shouldn't he say is Spanish Omelet instead? Or was he just being snooty and trying to insult our intelligent by telling us is American? \n\nAn entree - Ribeye Steak. This was the only decent dish we had and we had. \n\nNow on to the service - where do I begin? There are no praises for the server. I would have tolerated the bad food in exchanged for superb, friendly service. But in this case, our server was an old, snobbish, unfriendly man whom we caught him on a night when he didn't feel like working so he decided to ruin our evening by giving us lip and attitude. I was the last to arrive to join my dining party. I was never offer water and even after I've placed the food order, he didn't bother to ask me if I would like a glass of wine or something to drink. Obviously he didn't want to do extra work. He didn't bother asking how my dining companion like his steak either. He never once come back to check on us during the meal nor did he offered coffee and desserts. \n\nThe place was dead on a Wednesday night. Only our table of 3 and another table of 2. I should not have ignore my instinct of never eating at a place where food comes to die! I have a strong suspicion that the cook must be Chinese as all the dishes are all covered in starchy sauce just like bad Chinese food in lousy Chinese restaurant. Plus he used shitake mushrooms in a Spanish dish. What do you think? \n\nTo have eaten here was a total waste of my time and money, the food left a bad taste in my mouth and insulted my intelligence and appreciation for gourmet food. I was actually skeptical to write this review for fear of tarnishing my Gourmet Princessa reputation of eating a terrible meal.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-10-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Thankfully, they still had calamari frito y gambas al ajillo."], "author": "Anthony D.", "review": "Still no croquetas.

It's got a good vibe to it - as it's the cultural center for San Francisco's more-substantial-than-you-think Spanish community, it's been decorated with care and attention to detail (and it's pretty cool that Juan Carlos inaugurated it). The dining room itself is rather breathtaking. Likewise because it's a meeting place for the Spanish community, it's affordable since they need to cater to people with diverse incomes. Also, because it's in an out of the way neighborhood (though not all that seedy - the area around has low crime) it's refreshingly free of any of the poisons that can annoy the average, cranky native San Franciscan - out-of-towners, yuppies, or hipsters.

Now, to the most important part..\n\nThe food is not outstanding, but very good - a B/B+. What gets it a little extra are two things:\n\n1) They've usually got a regionally diverse group of tapas.

Patio Espanola popped up on my Yelp list at the first search for \"paella\".  Minimum paella order is 2 but because we wanted to explore the tapas menu and didn't want to wind up with leftovers we paid an extra $6 charge to order 1. Not a problem because the paella valenciana was so worth it. It was flavorful and packed with seafood and chicken. Cooked perfectly. We devoured it and actually found the 1 order to be just enough. The order came with a bowl of sopa de ajo (garlic soup) that was delicious as well with it's rustic flavor and perfect temperature. We had 3 tapas. Our fave was the chorizo manchego so flavorful we started to clean up the bottom of the serving dish with bread so as not to waste the flavors of the chorizo oil and onions/peppers combined. Also had the variety of olives and the pan de Jamon Serrano. Sounds like a lot of food but I thought the tapas servings were perfectly sized for 2 (maybe even 3 but we are big eaters) and we had just enough room to squeeze in a tangy, tasty passionfruit mousse cake. I'd like to add that the restaurant had a nice charming ambience. High ceiling with exposed beams, lots of pictures and wrought-iron displays. Yes it is part of the Spanish cultural center.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I thy paella valenciana  ", "the was good.

As for the food...\n\nSopa de Ajo Aragonesa - Their very garlic-y soup really lived up to its namesake so don't expect to be making out with anyone afterwards, but YUM!\n\nSetas Silvestres al Ajillo - Mushrooms in some type of wine/garlic sauce. The sauce was out of this world. Try dipping your bread in it once you've cleaned the plate of mushrooms.\n\nCalamares Fritos - The calamari didn't really stand out, but it was good nontheless.\n\nDaily Special! Catfish croquettas - OMG soooo good. Orgasmically so quite frankly. The catfish was very fresh and the croquetta came out nice and light. Not overfried like other places tend to do.\n\nPaella Valenciana - The portions were huge so bring along an empty stomach; they also give you a LOT of seafood. [Note: You have to order at least 2 portions of the same paella so it comes to roughly 44USD minimum, but between 6 of us, there was just the right amount of food]\n\nSolomillo a la Andaluza - You can't really go wrong with Filet Mignon, but it was a tad more medium than rare for my personal taste.\n\nDaily Special! Leg of Lamb - They have specific family dinner options for every night of the week. We happened to drop by on a Thursday and got to try their lamb. Fabulous and tender. The meat fell right off the bones!\n\nThe service was great, very friendly and they honestly wanted to make you enjoy your food.
