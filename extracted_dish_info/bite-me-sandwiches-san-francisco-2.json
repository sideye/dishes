There was only one person in the place.\n\nMe - Yes! No waiting in line! Sweet.\n\nThere were two dudes behind the counter. One did obviously not want to help me at all. I couldn't tell if he was actually working there or not. The other guy finally came over and was friendly.\n\nI ordered the Danny Zuko as recommended on Sour Dough. (I'm sorry people, I just don't like Dutch Crunch. Hate on haters.) I asked for it with mustard and he said it comes with everything, question mark. Me - yes, everything. Then he listed everything off which I found reassuring and made me more convinced I wanted it all.\n\nspoiler - I want it all.\n\nI took the sandwich to go. It was nice and warm in my hands. Ate it at the office, all of it. Every last bite. The turkey was nice and fresh, not sliced. It was juicy but not overly so. It dripped on the wax paper, but not on my desk. Always appreciated. After finishing the first half I went for the second. Very full, but not in an uncomfortable way. It was spicy, but with just enough kick to be spicy and no lingering pain. Really good all around. I'd go back and try something else for sure.\n\nNot a five though. Really solid sandwich. Nice service once the right guy came over, good menu, nice ingredients, but I didn't moan out loud or embarrass myself or anything which means it was excellent, but not orgasmic.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Danny Zuko.

If you live in the Mission and love great sandwiches (definitely on par with Ike's for SURE), try out Bite Me Sandwiches. In particular, there are 3 sandwiches that really stand out (I get lunch there about once a week). In no particular order: \n\n1. Avogobble. (off-menu) Simple avocado, sprouts, and turkey. Get it with everything. The turkey is made onsite same-day, none of that lunch meat crap. Delish. For an extra kick, add honey mustard. \n\n2. Ike Who? (off-menu) Decadent, delicious. An obvious stab at Ike's, but whatever. This sandwich is da bomb.\n\n3. Danny Zuko. Turkey, bacon, avocado, jalapenos, and swiss cheese. It's awesome.\n\nGet your sandwiches on Dutch Crunch, and you won't be disappointed. Great sandwich for a great price - they impress me every time.

When picking a spot for our weekly office lunch, I decided to try Bite Me Sandwiches. Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, July 28th around 12 noon.\n\nI got the San Fran: Chicken breast, bacon, avocado, jack cheese, mayo, mustard, Mojo (special garlic sauce, contains mayo) lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, banana peppers, and pepperoncini on Sliced Sourdough ($13.35) and Chips: Zesty Jalapeno ($2.45). I loved all the ingredients in the sandwich, but I wanted more filling. I love giant sandwiches since I'm not the biggest bread person. Also, I felt like the sandwich was a little dry. The chicken was actually pieces of chicken breast, so it needed more sauce or something for added moisture. The chips were your standard kettle cooked chips. Nice and crunchy. A coworker of mine also ordered the Macaroni Salad ($4.05 small). I had a bite and enjoyed it with some hot sauce. She loved it and finished the whole thing.\n\nGlad I was able to try Bite Me. Plus, who doesn't love the name of this place?! But do I want to bite into them again? Probably not.
