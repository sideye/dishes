The chicken itself honestly isn't the most tender or juiciest chicken in my life, but the dish as a whole, with the delicious bread salad, makes the dish a must get for me. The bread soaks up all the delicious juices of the chicken; I'm sure you'll be wishing you had more bread.

I do wish my water was attended to as much as my plates were.\n\nWe started with the Crustone with burrata alla panna, cherry tomatoes, anise hyssop, and bee pollen.

I am a big fan of okra, so this was a real treat. For those who hate okra's sliminess, Zuni eliminates the slime and leaves behind only the flavor. Nicely breaded onions, okra and eggplant without leaving one feeling like a fatass.\n\nFollowing those two were the Pio Tosini prosciutto with pea shoots, grilled orange tapenade, and pecorino sardo and the Zuni Caesar Salad.

I wish I could just have ordered the warm bread salad.\n\nAccompanying the chicken were the shoestring potatoes with housemade ketchup. These are so fun and tasty, and the ketchup was tangy and marinara-ish. A small part of me wishes the presentation was better and that they served these in bowls instead.

"], "author": "Cathy N.", "review": "So I work for this company that has this Founder who is a regular at Zuni. Every time he takes a client, staff to lunch or dinner in the city (San Francisco), he almost always recommend/take them to Zuni. After observing his consistency of his attendance at Zuni, I remember asking him a few months ago, \"is Zuni that good?\" A gracious man he is, \"yes! Have you been there? We will go there one day for lunch or dinner!\" And here we are, months later I finally got the opportunity to try this place out. And what better of a person to try it out than Dr. Garcia (Doc -as we like to call him) the regular.\n\nPARKING:\nSo, if you follow my reviews, you know how much I dread looking for parking in San Francisco. I mean, that is the reason why people sell their cars and invest in bikes after moving to the city. Luckily, it only took me minutes to find a parking spot on the street. Then again, it was a Tuesday (yesterday) night. So far, the evening is looking good!\n\nLOCATION:\nThis restaurant is located on a street corner with tall glass windows and warmly lit. And when I say, \"warmly\" I meant the ambiance is very cozy and pleasant. When the Boyfriend and I walked by, we saw people completely packed the place. I thought we might not have a place to sit. Not bad for a Tuesday night eh?\n\nUPON ENTRY:\nWe saw our Founder at the front podium talking to the hostesses. Very pretty might I say. They smiled at us as we entered and approached Doc. He immediately lead us to the bar. As we make our way through the cozy space to the bar, we were greeted with smiles by every staff member there. Amazing.\n\nINTERIOR:\nIt's pretty small and narrow. The tables and seatings are pretty close together, but the layout works for this unique place. Tables are close together, but enough room for people to walk through. Pass these tables, you arrive at the beautiful bar (very welcoming). Here you have a little standing room, but it is probably beacause they kitchen is located right behind you so foot space is necessary. There is an upstairs area which I have yet to check out. Pass the bar and kitchen entrance, you walk into another area with booths. Neat! This is where we were seated.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nOnce we were told our table was ready, we were escorted by the hostess with a tray for our drinks. She placed our drinks on it and lead us to our table (reminded me of that 'As Good As It Gets' movies when Helen Hunt was about to get seated and a guy offered his tray for her drink so that she doesn't have to hold her drink to her table. Pretty awesome). Everyone smiled, presented a professional mannerism, even the bus boys were nice and polite. They're on top of their game, after every dish we finished, they were there in a minute to clear it out for us. We were always given clean utensils after every usage (that's crazy).\n\nFOOD:\nWow. Doc ordered a lot of dishes for us so let me see if I can remember them all. We started with 6 different flavors of oysters. I can't remember all of them, but I do remember my favorite: Drake's Bay. However, they were all freaking delish! I didn't know you can make oysters taste different flavors! \n\nThen, we began our dinner with the Zuni Caesar Salad. I never seen it served a whole leave of lettuce before. And it was perfectly dressed with caesar dressing with a nice large crouton(s). Normally caesar dressing packs too much of a punch so I often request it on the side, but I have to say, best caesar salad ever. So simple but definitely hit the spot.\n\nOur came the Bellwether Farms Ricotta Gnocchi, and honestly when I heard Doc order it, I had no idea what he said nor did I know how it was going to look like. But, just the fact that I've seen him cook at work, I trust his choices in the foods. There was enough for each person to have three Ricotta Gnocchi. Wow, the most tastiest, softest little things ever! (uhm, excuse me, can I order a bucket full of this?) I even asked for the boyfriend's share (I was kidding of course, but he ended up giving me the last one anyways -yep! I'm spoiled!).\n\nNext our chicken for Two Roasted in The Brick Oven came out. This I have heard Doc kept on repeating to our waiter. I was curious, what this was. Anyways, finally our chicken came out and it the presentation was gorgeous. Doc served us each a piece. I even grabbed some of the dandelion greens and stuffing. So tender, juicy, full of flavor and to top it off -I didn't even know pine nuts can be so good with chicken! This must've been their signature dish because our table wasn't the only one that ordered it.\n\nDoc ordered us some short ribs as well, and the meat was soft and juicy. Not touch like I would expect it to be. I'm not usually a fan of short ribs but these were to die for.\n\nVERDICT:\nI have tasted many great foods before, but the thing here that won my attention was the costumer service.

I like to come here for the roast chicken - it's the best chicken I've ever had - it's juicy, tender and infused with flavor - well worth the one hour preparation time.  The dish is actually prepared for two people, which had me worried because I went with four other people who were somewhat opposed to the dish:  two of my friends are seafood-vegetarians, one friend is allergic to gluten (the chicken comes with a Tuscan-style bread salad) and another friend gave meat up for lent (how selfish of her).  I finally convinced the gluten friend to do the chicken with me, only because the restaurant accommodated us by putting the bread salad on the side.  The majority of the appetizers and entrees we had were excellent:  the crisp Zuni Caesar salad, vegetable soup, beautiful bite-sized seared scallops, sea bream in a delicious broth with shellfish, and scrumptious \"blue nose\" bass.  The only dish I was not fond of was the risotto, which seemed undercooked, bland and runny.  For dessert, we had the espresso granita, chocolate pot de crme, and chocolate cake.  All were slightly above average.\n\nService:  4 stars.  This place could easily be pretentious, but fortunately the staff is not.  Our server seemed friendly and down-to-earth, although he did not appear amused by the gag gift that my friends had brought with them, which we placed on the table.  Otherwise, service was smooth and consistent throughout the night.  The front of the house was also accommodating, especially when one of my really good friends notified me at the last minute to add another person to the table AND made us late for our reservation.  \n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.  The restaurant's design is fascinating.  Tables are nipped and tucked in various spaces throughout.  There is a maze of rooms on the second floor, with the prime dining spots overlooking the bustling activity in the standing-room only bar or the beautiful main dining area.  The kitchen is also open for all to see.   The single-use restrooms are mislabeled \"Men\" and \"Women.\"  The patrons (both sexes) don't seem to care what's on the door.

Both dishes were so good, I used the bread to sop up the plate so I wouldn't miss/waste any of the flavors!\n\nBut there was something else we really came for.

Big enough for 2 and a few bites the next day, it was roasted with toasted bread stuffing, pine nuts, mustard greens, currants, garlic, pepper, wine vinegar - and small slices of heaven.

"], "author": "Roxmarie M.", "review": "Well, after the fandango around making our late night reservations last week, it seemed everything was in place for us to dine at Zuni at 10pm. I did have one more guest and called them the day before feeling great trepidation because of my previous experience with a reservationist. This time they just said \"no problem at all; you just might need to wait 10 or 15 minutes.\" Which was fine.\n\nSo we arrived (late) and they were able to sit six of us with no problems. I'm not sure why they said they could only seat four when I called last week, but winging it at the last minute seemed to go just fine.\n\nI have lived in in SF for the past 25 years, but until this point I had only actually been to Zuni twice; once, to try their margarita and another time to try their roast chicken. So I had never really had a dining adventure with their menu or seen their full service in action.\n\nIt was fun getting there so late and I'm so glad they could accomodate us. We had been to the theatre so had lots to talk about with one of the actors at the table with us. They let us take it slow even at that hour which is also much appreciated. \n\nEverything on the menu except for just a few items was available. \n\nWe started with the Fettunta. I am sure many have heard of that, but the way the Waiter explained it was, \"Well it's a vehicle really... see in Italy they cold press this green green olive oil and in less than two days it's flown here and we serve it at the table. It's like the beaujolais nouveaux of olive oil.\" That last part really got our San Francisco Muppie hearts pounding. Then he said, \"So well actually it's toast.\"\n\nAnyway, the Fettunta arrived in the form of a nice toasted slab of tuscan-style bread soaked with this Olio Verde, which we cut up into many small bits. Also some raw raddicchio leaves, carrot curls, and tender baby celery stalks. We all took a bite of the fettunta and simultaneously our eyes got wide and that's when our heads exploded and the waiters had to tell the bus boys to mop the ceilings.\n\nI have since looked up the word Fettunta online, and despite the fact that it sounds kind of like a lewd name for a body part in Italian, it's really basically the purest form of garlic bread, heavy on the Olio. My theory is that some of the spiciness may have been a garlic kick although perhaps there was no garlic included - there was just a very grassy, then spicy, then nutty progression over about 15 seconds; I'm going to get a bottle of that Olio Verde at Zuni this week for the holidays, and I plan to ask them if there is garlic in their Fettunta (not a euphemism).\n\nWe also enjoyed their frites by the handful. Worth stopping by for the frites and I'd love to try their other fried veggie appetizer.\n\nI had the grouper with capers and shallots alongside another toast which had chard, meyer lemon, and boiled egg on top of it. It was all really soulful and delicious, and maybe I was dreaming but it tasted like it had yet more of the wonderful Olio Verde on it. My immediate dining companion enjoyed a bowl of polenta, which was another dimension in comfort food. Others had the whole wheat spaghetti with veggies and the conigio appetizer. Their wine selection was nice and the cocktails were good, and we shared a floating island at the end - a delicate white creme anglaise dotted with pistachios and pomegranate seeds, with a sweet little white meringue in the center.\n\nI also appreciated the hot toddy the waiter brought when I said I had a cold. It was like theraflu only much better :-)\n\nWe stayed til after 12:30 and there were still guests in the place. The restaurant business can be hard on the body and mind, and I'm impressed that a place like Zuni can maintain such great comfort and decorum after such an intensely long day. I wish I had the means to make it a point to go there a lot more often. Actually I may stop in tomorrow for a couple of bottles of that Olive Oil as Christmas gifts.

I asked my cousin to book a place since I didn't care where I was eating - as long as we got to catch up. We came to Zuni Cafe one lovely evening for dinner. We had made reservations for our meal here about two nights prior and they were easily made. Our party of four was easily seated once we came in.\n\n[decor]\nZuni's ambiance doesn't really have anything going for them. It's not really pretty-looking. It seems a bit run-down, but maybe because the building is old. There's a lot of light from the windows. Weird seating area for the diners. There's a second level for dining as well, but looks a bit as cramped as the rest of the resto. A bar is available and has shelves of liquor. I'm surprised that the hobo's hanging outside haven't broken the windows for some booze =X\n\n[devour]\n*OYSTERS ($2.50-3.75/each, ***4 STARS***) - Zuni has a laundry list of oysters! Out of all the ones we tried (~3/person), we were quite fond of the DRAKE'S BAY OYSTERS (from Point Bay). This was recommended by our waiter and I totally agree with his recommendation! I don't recall the names of the other oysters we tried, but they weren't as memorable as the Drake's Bay! =) \n\n*CEASAR SALAD ($10, ***2 STARS***) - The \"infamous\" Caesar salad didn't really seem to amuse me. I thought the dressing on the romaine lettuce was lacking some \"oomph\". Sorry I wasn't getting the hype. BUT!!!!! I did LOVE THE CROUTONS, which were very garlicky, buttery, and crispy - just the way it should be. I just wanted to eat all of the croutons instead of the greens =X ...... and I hate to say it, but I've had better Caesar salad in Portland (Yes, I'm talking about 23 Hoyt and Apizza Scholls).\n\n*SHOESTRING POTATOES ($6, ***3 STARS***) - was your typical run-of-the-mill fries. They are skinny in size, so you can devour more of them. You get a good pile of the shoestring fries, that it's good to share with about 4-5 people. Fries were decently cooked. It came with a side of ketchup. The dish was just a wallflower in my book. Also, it can easily get cold and after a few minutes, it won't be as appetizing after 20 minutes. \n\n*PORK CHOP ($28, ***3 STARS***) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zuni-cafe-san-francisco?select=3Q4JjgM9Cb_TLGgZjKvAUA) - the pork chop was sadly dry on one end, but tender and succulent on the other side of the bone. Although, most of the chop was well-done and was kinda difficult to manipulate, it did come with flavorful sides - greens and some-what-lookin-mash-potato-dish (can't recall names). I would have rather gobbled up the sides and call it a day. The au jus by the chop was very savory! Everything on the dish was excellently prepared, minus the pork chop..... kinda torn if I would eat this again.  \n\n*ROASTED CHICKEN FOR TWO ($48, ***4.5 STARS***) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zuni-cafe-san-francisco?start=300#y9HIlZT_CvbiXwHzsqS_RA) - I think this is more like roasted chicken for 4 or 5 people! (unless you want leftovers, then it's good for two). If you're thinking about ordering this dish (ORDER IT ONCE YOU SIT DOWN) since it will take 1 hour (yes that's 60 minutes) for them to roast the thing! \n\nThe chicken is roasted in their brick oven for one hour. It came out very moist and succulent. You would think that the breast of the chicken would turn out dry, but I was AMAZED it wasn't! This dish is served fam bam style and comes with a warm bread salad that has chopped scallions, greens, embedded with dried currants and pine nuts. I must say that I loved that bread salad WAYYYY more than the Caesar. I wish they had the bread salad alone as an appetizer. So if I loved everything about this dish, why wasn't it 5 Stars? Well I wish the skin of the chicken was a bit more crispy. Then again, nothing is perfect! It was a good piece of chicken! Way better than your Costco rotisserie my friends! \n\n[drank]\nA glass of their red wine (ranges $8-11) was nice and paired well with the roasted chicken. \n\nFYI =\n-They charge 4% to your bill to support the \"SF employer mandates\" (so glad PDX doesn't do that!)\n-Party of 6+ will have an automatic 18% gratuity\n-Complimentary bread & butter: expect LOTS of bread crumbs (mess alert!)\n-Great service (water glasses attentively filled)\n-Full bar available\n-BYOW? Cork fee $20/bottle\n-Parking on the street (metered)\n-CC's accepted (Visa, MC, Amex)\n\nAlthough there are mixed reviews about Zuni Cafe, my dining experience was also mixed.

Since I believe in the City and its food,  I made a reservation to meet up with a friend and her son for lunch at Zuni Cafe.\n\nWe started with a Caesar salad and the broccoli di ciccio and Manila clams a la plancha with Rancho Gordo white beans, lemon zest, and garlic.  The Caesar was tasty with a fantastic garlicky, anchovy dressing.  And those beans were just off the hook.  Smooth and delicious.  Both dishes were so good, I used the bread to sop up the plate so I wouldn't miss/waste any of the flavors!\n\nBut there was something else we really came for.  For years I'd heard of and wondered about this dish.  I even felt inferior as a native San Franciscan for never having tried it.  Even 7x7 Magazine seemed to remind me of this inferiority by listing it high on the Big Eat every year.  Unfortunately, on previous visits to Zuni, it just didn't feel like the thing to order.

The presentation was beautiful before we started in on it.  And I don't care what they say.  The dish is not for two.  There were 2.5 people working on it at the table and we almost finished half of it.  My friend and I split the leftovers so technically it fed 4.5 people.  \n\nAnd I no longer feel inferior because I have eaten what every native San Franciscan should at least once in their lifetime.\n\nWe also ordered the bowl of polenta with mascarpone that went very well with the chicken.\n\nAll in all, a great meal and a delicious way to renew my belief in this City and its food.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-07"}, {"excerpts": ["We started with drinks, fries and olives to tide us over while waiting for the roasted chicken for two (takes aprox an hour).

"], "author": "Nathan B.", "review": "Zuni has a reputation for good, consistent and rustic food in a beautiful setting on Market street.  I have sampled quite a bit, and there are some good things, some poor choices, and perhaps a few unsupervised cooks.\n\nThe oyster selection is wonderful.  The people shucking them however, aren't always.  It's pretty common to get a really sad looking oyster, or one that's even spawning, but after observing the kitchen, the chef de cuisine or sous chef does not appear to be checking them before they go out.  \n\nWhat's curious to me is why they only offer a basic mignonette.  Black pepper and shallots in vinegar is so boring.  There's no inventiveness there, and even the very popular choice of cocktail sauce is not available, as well as prepared horseradish.  I understand not offering horseradish out of season, but there's not much harm in having prepared or pickled horseradish for your customers.  \n\nZuni's caesar salad has quite the reputation.  Even though they for some reason decide to use a broken aioli dressing for this salad, it's delicious.  What doesn't stack up are the croutons.  They look like they came from a salad buffet bar, and they don't taste like much.  I would love to see long crostinis with baked parmesan and garlic on top, or even rustically torn and dressed toasted bread served with the chicken.  \n\nThe plate of fries are crispy and delicious, but I cannot understand the choice to only offer an unusually large amount of fries for $6.  Even for two people, it can be too many fries.  For 3 or 4, it works out great.  I'd happily pay a couple bucks less for a much smaller plate.  But, if you can eat them all or share them, I recommend getting them!  Just make sure to ask for extra condiments, cause they'll give you a tiny morsel of ketchup (I mean literally an ounce).\n\nThe $15 Zuni burger that comes without fries is praised as one of the cities best, but a burger can only be as well as it's cooked.  I can never get a properly cooked burger here.  Even before I eat the burger, I can tell just by touching it what the temp is.  How come no one else is checking this? I've had a burger here a few times within the last year, and every time I ask for medium rare, I get something between medium and mid well, and they are always dry.  If I send them back, I get the exact same thing.\n\nThe burger itself is round, but served on square foccacia bread that is lathered in aioli.  Round burger on square bread?  Okay, well as conceptually flawed as that is, the foccacia is very delicious and a great vessel.  Another one of the problems you'll find is the garnishes.  If you get sliced tomato, they're narrow and too thick.  Same issue with the onions.  They also choose a lettuce that wilts far too easily resting underneath the burger.  Because of this, it makes it flat out impossible to eat your burger without deconstructing it.  The burgers most redeeming qualities are the pickles on the side, which are very excellent.\n\nThe roasted chicken for two is definitely a wait, but a good thing to wait for if you fancy paying way too much money for chicken.  The skin is crispy, the chicken is moist and well seasoned, and the bread salad with mustard greens is delicious.  I really wish the bread salad was larger, considering it's a $48 plate.  If you're a chicken lover, you will really enjoy this, but your wallet will not, especially when you can recreate this dish at home for less money.  \n\nThe cocktails here are just okay, very pricy, and very small.  Take special note if you get a martini, for they serve you unpitted olives on a toothpick that sink into the glass.  Good (over priced) wine selection, and really bad beer selection.  \n\nOverall, I have found the food very inconsistent, and for the very high prices they charge along with really bad service, I'm not terribly eager to return.

A veritable bargain at $6 for two large bowls I would recommend this without hesitation.\n\nWith the table next to us thankfully clearing out and the service stepping up a notch to keep water and coffee full the arrival of our main course, a dish considered by some to be the #1 \"must try\" dish in San Francisco, was announced by the hostess first rearranging our silverware to accommodate the plate and then by an aroma somewhere between sweet and savory, vinegar and rosemary, garlic and onion...and utterly enticing.\n\nDescribed in the menu as \"Roasted chicken for two with warm bread salad with scallions, currants, and pine nuts\" but invariably more than the sum of its parts enough has been written about Zuni Caf\u00e9's chicken to fill a book, but carrying such a hefty price tag I can only say it is worth the price largely because it redefines any preconceived notions you may have about chicken being boring.

Moving on to the bread salad-at times crispy and others soaked with chicken drippings and olive oil-I absolutely loved the manner in which it augmented the chicken's taste with the sweetness of currants poking through with one bite and then the bitter mustard greens with another all under the veil of occasionally spicy notes of black pepper bringing the marjoram, garlic, and onion to full attention.\n\nEating slowly as we chatted I first enjoyed a breast, then a leg, and then a thigh plus a substantial amount of the salad before I realized just how big the bird was and taking into consideration my plans for the evening I decided the better part of valor was to stop here-a gesture that provided Jeff with at least lunch and possibly dinner for the following day-and commending us on our effort the hostess collected our plate and returned it to the kitchen for packaging before returning and offering us dessert which we considered but declined and subsequently presenting the bill-a tab that really did not seem all that out of line given the quality and quantity of the food.\n\nHaving heard some people complain that Zuni is expensive for what it is; essentially food you could just as easily prepare at home I will note that while this may be true the fact of the matter is that I don't often cook like this at home and when I do it rarely is this good.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-09-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Roasted chicken for two (of course)\n\n"], "author": "Taylor S.", "review": "Zuni was my birthday dinner spot. \n\nA daily-based menu, semi-industrial atmosphere - sounds charming.

It's obvious they've succeeded in maintain this careful equilibrium just by looking around at the diverse patrons (a group of  boisterous 20-somethings celebrating a birthday, a culinary destination for out-of-town guests, a couple on a romantic intimate date, a pair of foodie friends out for a late-night bite, older companions having a quiet, intimate meal).\n\nIt's no wonder it's been at the top of its game for over 30 years.

So when my hubby surprised me with dinner at Zuni Caf\u00e9 and tickets to Wicked, I made sure to have their roasted chicken this time. We had a tight schedule (5:30pm reservations and 7:30pm show time) but thanks to their efficient staff, we were able to enjoy our meal (including dessert!) without feeling too rushed or stressed about time. Since they don't take orders for the chicken in advance, we asked the host to place our order as soon as we were seated.  \n\nKusshi Oysters from British Columbia - What an impressive oyster selection! They had an extensive list of oysters, including kumamotos (my favorite) from 3 different regions. Our waiter suggested that I try the kusshi oysters since they are similar to the kumamotos but slightly larger and creamier...I fell in love! The kusshis were sweet and refreshing with a luscious creaminess.\n\nHouse-cured Anchovies with Celery, Parmesan, and Ni\u00e7oise Olives - simple, yet sublime. A perfectly balanced dish with really high quality ingredients. The anchovies were rich and oily, but not too overpowering or fishy. The parmesan provided a sharp flavor contrast, while the crunchy celery provided texture contrast. Not liking the taste of celery, I appreciated how the paper thin slices kept the flavor subtle enough for me to enjoy it.\n\nBellwether Farms Ricotta Gnocchi with Leeks - Heavenly pillows! The gnocchi had such an extraordinarily light and fluffy consistency - it was almost like they dissolved in my mouth. The leeks added a delicate, sweet onion flavor. The dish was buttery and rich yet also surprisingly light - needless to say, it was gobbled up in mere seconds! \n\nBrick Oven Roasted Chicken for Two with Tuscan Warm Bread Salad - very tasty chicken...the skin was deliciously seasoned and the meat was extremely moist and tender. The warm bread salad added to the rustic and hearty feel of the dish, while the mustard greens, currants, and pine nuts rounded out the flavors and textures. I only wish the chicken had been served at a warmer temperature - not sure why it wasn't since it was made to order\n\nCr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Panna Cotta with Wild Huckleberry Sauce - a great way to end a delicious meal. I was originally worried that the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche would give the panna cotta a sour tone, but instead it actually added a creamy complexity while keeping the panna cotta remarkably light. The sweet huckleberry sauce was a perfect complement. \n\nI would definitely go back to Zuni Caf\u00e9 again. This experience more than made up for my last one - this is why I believe you really have to dine at a restaurant more than once to get a true sense of a place. Although I thought the chicken was very good, I wouldn't wait an hour for it again nor do I think it's worth $48 (hubby disagrees) - I'd rather order some of the other entrees next time...or just feast on their incredible oysters!\n\nFor pics of each course, go to my personal blog (link under my profile).", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-04-07"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the roasted chicken for two, preceded by the Caesar Salad.

So you sometimes end up eating a veggie you may not particularly like.\n\nShoestring potatoes - A nice mound of freshly fried potatoes. Served with a little side of ketchup.\n\nChicken - The reason I came here! I had a piece of the thigh which was nice and juicy. But looking at the breast pieces that came out, I could tell they were dry. I asked my friend who ate a breast piece and he confirmed that it was indeed dry. The bread salad underneath was a little inconsistent. There were portions that had good chicken and vinaigrette flavor. And other portions that were dry and tasted like a moist crouton. I tried to avoid those pieces.\n\nIf the chicken didn't take about an hour to prepare, I probably would have skipped some of the apps and went straight for the chicken since I wasn't very excited about the rest of the menu.

Instead, I ordered the $10 Zuni Caesar Salad, which probably was a trendsetter at the time it was concocted but was honestly just a good, hearty Caesar with fresh spears of Romaine lettuce (see photo). Jamie W. finally got out of his neighborhood meeting and was able to come join me at that point.

I asked my cousin to book a place since I didn't care where I was eating - as long as we got to catch up. We came to Zuni Cafe one lovely evening for dinner. We had made reservations for our meal here about two nights prior and they were easily made. Our party of four was easily seated once we came in.\n\n[decor]\nZuni's ambiance doesn't really have anything going for them. It's not really pretty-looking. It seems a bit run-down, but maybe because the building is old. There's a lot of light from the windows. Weird seating area for the diners. There's a second level for dining as well, but looks a bit as cramped as the rest of the resto. A bar is available and has shelves of liquor. I'm surprised that the hobo's hanging outside haven't broken the windows for some booze =X\n\n[devour]\n*OYSTERS ($2.50-3.75/each, ***4 STARS***) - Zuni has a laundry list of oysters! Out of all the ones we tried (~3/person), we were quite fond of the DRAKE'S BAY OYSTERS (from Point Bay). This was recommended by our waiter and I totally agree with his recommendation! I don't recall the names of the other oysters we tried, but they weren't as memorable as the Drake's Bay! =) \n\n*CEASAR SALAD ($10, ***2 STARS***) - The \"infamous\" Caesar salad didn't really seem to amuse me. I thought the dressing on the romaine lettuce was lacking some \"oomph\". Sorry I wasn't getting the hype. BUT!!!!! I did LOVE THE CROUTONS, which were very garlicky, buttery, and crispy - just the way it should be. I just wanted to eat all of the croutons instead of the greens =X ...... and I hate to say it, but I've had better Caesar salad in Portland (Yes, I'm talking about 23 Hoyt and Apizza Scholls).\n\n*SHOESTRING POTATOES ($6, ***3 STARS***) - was your typical run-of-the-mill fries. They are skinny in size, so you can devour more of them. You get a good pile of the shoestring fries, that it's good to share with about 4-5 people. Fries were decently cooked. It came with a side of ketchup. The dish was just a wallflower in my book. Also, it can easily get cold and after a few minutes, it won't be as appetizing after 20 minutes. \n\n*PORK CHOP ($28, ***3 STARS***) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zuni-cafe-san-francisco?select=3Q4JjgM9Cb_TLGgZjKvAUA) - the pork chop was sadly dry on one end, but tender and succulent on the other side of the bone. Although, most of the chop was well-done and was kinda difficult to manipulate, it did come with flavorful sides - greens and some-what-lookin-mash-potato-dish (can't recall names). I would have rather gobbled up the sides and call it a day. The au jus by the chop was very savory! Everything on the dish was excellently prepared, minus the pork chop..... kinda torn if I would eat this again.  \n\n*ROASTED CHICKEN FOR TWO ($48, ***4.5 STARS***) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zuni-cafe-san-francisco?start=300#y9HIlZT_CvbiXwHzsqS_RA) - I think this is more like roasted chicken for 4 or 5 people! (unless you want leftovers, then it's good for two). If you're thinking about ordering this dish (ORDER IT ONCE YOU SIT DOWN) since it will take 1 hour (yes that's 60 minutes) for them to roast the thing! \n\nThe chicken is roasted in their brick oven for one hour. It came out very moist and succulent. You would think that the breast of the chicken would turn out dry, but I was AMAZED it wasn't! This dish is served fam bam style and comes with a warm bread salad that has chopped scallions, greens, embedded with dried currants and pine nuts. I must say that I loved that bread salad WAYYYY more than the Caesar. I wish they had the bread salad alone as an appetizer. So if I loved everything about this dish, why wasn't it 5 Stars? Well I wish the skin of the chicken was a bit more crispy. Then again, nothing is perfect! It was a good piece of chicken! Way better than your Costco rotisserie my friends! \n\n[drank]\nA glass of their red wine (ranges $8-11) was nice and paired well with the roasted chicken. \n\nFYI =\n-They charge 4% to your bill to support the \"SF employer mandates\" (so glad PDX doesn't do that!)\n-Party of 6+ will have an automatic 18% gratuity\n-Complimentary bread & butter: expect LOTS of bread crumbs (mess alert!)\n-Great service (water glasses attentively filled)\n-Full bar available\n-BYOW? Cork fee $20/bottle\n-Parking on the street (metered)\n-CC's accepted (Visa, MC, Amex)\n\nAlthough there are mixed reviews about Zuni Cafe, my dining experience was also mixed.

"], "author": "Steph C.", "review": "I have to confess that my much-anticipated dinner at Zuni was a bit fuzzy thanks to a few too many Moscow Mules in the afternoon.  I recall running downstairs to stick my head in a toilet before ordering - which is all to say, take my review with a grain of salt.\n\nConsidering I was a bit sick at dinner, I had a great time at Zuni.  I came with a party of ten, which was the maximum party size, and we were seated upstairs among white walls and light wood at a long table set with white tablecloth.  We had a six o'clock reservation and with the sun still out, the space felt cheerful and welcoming.  Service was helpful.  We were a large party and I can't think of a single goof on Zuni's end.\n\nThe food was pretty fantastic.  I was able to enjoy it despite my debilitated state, and I remember everything I ate.  We started with some crusty rustic brown bread, then ordered a bunch of dishes more or less family style.\n\nBelieve everything you hear about Zuni's roast chicken.  It is an absolute must.  It serves two people, and I would recommend it even if ordering it means you don't try anything else.  It was probably the best roast chicken I've ever had, moist and juicy and utterly dripping with pure chicken flavor.  It came on a bed of warm bread salad with scallions, dried currants, red mustard greens, and pine nuts, and this hearty salad would have been worth ordering on its own.  It was excellent under the chicken, as it soaked up the bird's flavorful juices.\n\nEverything else was solid as well.  Zuni uses simple ingredients and precise cooking to deliver some pretty impressive food.  Shoestring potatoes were great, salty and crispy, as was a bowl of gritty, corny polenta with mascarpone.  The burrata alla panna with grilled squash blossom, green beans, and Marash pepper was a superb little dish, with oozy cheese and earthy, piquant flavors.  The orecchiette was another winner, with greens, garlic, lemon zest, red onions, fresh ricotta, and black pepper.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were clear and bright.  The Liberty duck breast may not have wowed as much as the chicken, but it was another fabulous entree, served with baby carrots, wild nettles, fresh shelling beans, and chanterelle mushroom relish.\n\nDessert was less strong than the savory portion of the meal, but still worth getting.  The Maywood Farm fig tart with wildflower honey ice cream was nice, but a little flat.  The figginess was good, but I could have used a little more sugar, even if just from the fruit.  The Gateau Victoire with whipped cream was the better dessert.  I tend to find many chocolate desserts too rich, but this one had a light, almost whipped texture that made it easy to swallow.\n\nWithout the chicken, Zuni Cafe would be a strong four star restaurant in my book.  The other dishes were wonderful, but none of them had the same wow factor as that chicken.  That said, the food was consistently delicious and the succulent roasted chicken alone would have been worth going out of our way for.  Maybe I dined in a drunken rapture, but I thought the chicken was perfect, and certainly good enough to merit a full five stars.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-09-18"}, {"excerpts": ["For four of us, we shared one order of the chicken (I know they say it feeds two, but there is no way I could eat half of a chicken!) and shoestring potatoes.

I came here with my family for a final dinner before heading back out of town.  For four of us, we shared one order of the chicken (I know they say it feeds two, but there is no way I could eat half of a chicken!) and shoestring potatoes.  We all got a starter - two caesar salads, a spanish pepper with wax beans dish, and a clam dish.  The chicken took the expected hour.  Our starters also took probably about 40 minutes, which felt long for starters, but maybe was intentional to align with the chicken.  \n\nI was impressed with the starters - all were really good.  The croutons on the caesar were the awesome, flavorful, garlicky homemade kind.  The pepper and bean appetizer was different, flavorful, and interesting.  The clams were well cooked with a flavorful sauce.  So, no complaints on the actual starter dishes.  The disappointment was in the chicken.  The chicken is good, but so is Costco chicken.  It's a whole procession with the one hour wait for the chicken and I'm not convinced it's worth it.  The chicken comes on a (pretty small serving of) bread salad and is covered with mustard greens.  There's a ton of mustard greens, which are pretty bitter, so it seems as if they are there for decoration but there is a ton fo them!  The bread salad is good, especially the part that is moist from the chicken (some of the outside pieces were just bread...).  The chicken is good, but I definitely don't need to come back for it.  Maybe I just don't like chicken enough!\n\nAlso, as a side note, we accidentally came on the Sunday of gay pride parade.  The bar downstairs, and really the whole street corner, were insane.  We were seated upstairs to the back, which we thought would be pretty quiet, but were next to a super noisy and inappropriate table.  Not exactly what we had in mind for family dinner before heading out of town.  Also, the bathroom wait was insane - like about 20-30 minutes, literally.

They are supposedly known for their gnocchi and cesar salad and they did not disappoint.  The oysters were fresh and delicious.  The fig dish was slices of fig, onions and thin slices of lemon that were lightly breaded, lightly fried and then seasoned.  The dish was an amazing sensory experience.  My wife and I are not normally big chicken eaters.  However, this was a recommended \"can't miss\" item.  You need about a one hour prep time for the chicken.  It is a fire cooked dish.

Turns out we got amazing seats for such a last-minute booking - they sat us at a table on the 2nd floor right next to the window, so we had the street view and could people watch during our meal. \n\nTo squander some time/zap hunger pangs during the 1 hour chicken wait, we had:\n\n--DRINKS--\n1. The MOJITO was good. Solid, nothing special.\n\n2. The ELDERFLOWER COCKTAIL was delicious. Slightly bubbly. Comes in a champagne glass. Not too sweet, just right. \n\n--APPETIZERS--\n1. HOUSE CURED ANCHOVIES - comes w/ crescents (stalk cut the short way) of celery, squares of parmigiano-reggiano slices, & coquillo olives. I didn't find this dish to be a particularly glamorous or fancy dish. The anchovies were briny and tasty but I didn't care much for the celery. The cheese and olives were just okay. \n\n2. DEVIL'S GULCH RANCH RABBIT SALAD - comes with a few big leaves of red leaf lettuce, Pixie tangerines, and creme fraiche. The rabbit was mighty tasty and not gamey at all. I especially liked the bacon-textured pieces - chewy and flavorful. \n\n--MAIN--\nOf course we got the ROAST CHICKEN FOR 2. I'm not easily impressed by roast/rotisserie chickens as many places in the city serve them (e.g. Morning Due Cafe, La Fusion, etc). Unfortunately I was not wowed by the chicken here. It is definitely not $48-worthy chicken. Yes, it was tasty and the bread salad was decadent with all the roasting juices. For $48 I expect even the chicken breasts to be tender and juicy. The chicken breasts here are not - I found them quite dry. The thighs were good as were the drumsticks, but for $48...... I would probably not get this again. The red mustard greens are similar to arugula in taste, but with the heat and fats from the chicken, they quickly wilted. \n\nWe also had the SHOESTRING POTATOES alongside the chicken. It comes as a huge mound of shoestring fries on a dinner-size plate. Huuuuge portion! We could barely make a dent in it. They're really too stringy and crispy to qualify as fries - they're more like crunchy strands meant more for texture than for substance. \n\n\nVerdict?\nI'd be willing to come back to try their brunch menu and some of the other highly-reviewed dinner items, e.g. the pork chop.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-06-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Order:\nBurger w/ white cheddar & Shoestring potatoes: ", "Manfriend enjoyed his burger but felt it was over-priced.

It was well worth the wait, for this was the exact moment that I fell in love with bread salad.

The bar and the restaurant was in full effect, but luckily we were taken to one of the smaller little alcoves upstairs where it wasnt too loud. \n\nOur server was very nice, and was always on top of our beverage refilling and bread (mmmmm) replacing. We had a reasonably priced bottle of prosecco (not that we needed it after our post martini fest at Olive) and proceeded to order our dishes:\n\nSince it was a romantic evening, we decided to get in the mood and order some oysters! We selected 2 oysters each off the extensive oyster list: 2 baby skookums and 2 Humboldt kumamotos. The skookums were so-so, but the Humboldt kumomotos were so delicious that we ended up ordering one more each! \n\nWe also shared another Zuni classic, the Caesar salad. My sweet baby loooves Caesars, and having had this dish several times in the past, it was a logical choice. It was just as good as I remember, with the beautiful uncut leaves of romaine tossed with that infamous dressing, house-made croutons, and shaved parmesan. YUUUUM, and it is the perfect size to share for 2 people, and very reasonably priced at $10.\n\nFor the main dish, we had to order the Roast Chicken for 2. My sweet baby loves chicken, and I needed to see for myself what all the hype was about. Well my friends, there's no hype here. This chicken is unbelievable. It comes with the warm bread salad, greens, and topped with pine nuts and currants. The little currants add a unique and delicious sweetness to the unbelievably moist chicken. The crackly skin....sorry...started drooling.....what was I saying again? Oh right. The chicken definitely lived up to its reputation. We even had some left to bring home, which my sweet baby was disappointed to learn that I had generously shared our wealth and given it to her roomates! That just mean another trip back!\n\nThe desserts sounded delish, but we just couldn't fit any more it our happy tummies. \n\nAll in all, our Zuni experience was fantastic on every level, and I highly recommend all their signature dishes...even though we didn't get to order their yummerific shoestring potatoes.

Coming from Modesto Farm (as our server told me), as my friend who took me there said \"it's the most beautiful chicken I have ever seen and eaten.\" The chicken is simple and perfectly seasoned. Juicy, tender, and even the breast is moist. The bed of warm flatbread soaked up some of the juices and the dressing of the salad it came with.

Awesome, as I'd never been there before. \n\nWe get there slightly tardy for our reservation, but it's ok because there aren't very many people there. Nice for a Sunday night.

Our cocktails were fabulous (I got D to try a Sazerac despite the fact he doesn't normally like whiskey) and I had the Elderflower/Champagne cocktail. It was more than delightful.

Holy Hens Batman!!!  It is simply the best roast chicken I have ever had.

The caesar is just fab, with super-fresh speers of romaine, flecks of anchovies, shaved cheese and a light dressing.

We decided to bring in our own wines and pay the $20 corkage.  My sis and her hubby brought in a Robert Hunter sparkling wine they got in Sonoma, and my hubby and I brought a Merry Edwards Pinot, also from Sonoma.  The server didn't even bat an eye at us bringing two wines, which was good (some places tend to not like it if you bring your own).  At least we brought really good wines that were not on their list, and cannot be bought at retail...it gave us a chance to sample some of the nicer bottles in our cellars with a professionally cooked meal.  Don't think we could find a $50 retail bottle for $70 or less on their list (probably would be over $100) so I thought it was a great deal to bring in our own.  The bubbly went perfectly with the oysters and other appetizers, and the Pinot, which had the big russian river style, went perfectly with the chicken and duck (and even held up to the steak).\n\nFor dessert, we split an order of the blue cheese (came with some honey and walnuts) and the gateau victoire, a flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream.  Both were really good....I loved the blue cheese but I have to admit I have a weakness for flourless chocolate cake...it was very well made and the soft whipped cream went perfectly.  To go with it, I got some madeira, my sis got some tawny port, and the hubbies got some brandy.  \n\nWith all this, we managed to get out of the restaurant a little past 7...the servers were very conscious of the fact that we were going to a show, and made sure we made it out on time.

The shoestrings were very yummy but the chicken, I wasn't really that impressed.  it was just alright. It was a little on the salty side.  Everyone around was oohing and ahhing over their chicken and we were excited to do the same thing but  no luck.  It didn't happen.  I think my mom makes better chicken in her turbo cooker.\n\nFor dessert we had the espresso granita (took a few of your recommendations) and that was just alright too! It tasted like those coffee candies that are in the shape of a coffee bean and comes in a circular tin.  I was really said that my meal ended with this.  \n\nI don't know if I'll ever come back.
