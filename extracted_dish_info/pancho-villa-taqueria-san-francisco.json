Pancho Villa Taqueria is Exhibit 553 in support of this contention.  Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I have previously bitched and moaned about, I've been working hellacious hours lately.  Basically, 10-12 hours days, at least 6 days a week, for two months straight.  But, whatever, it's not like I have a lot of other things going on in my life, so work is a fine way to pass the time.  But, there's a limit on exactly how much of myself I can carve up and give away without repercussions.  On Monday, I woke up, didn't feel all that awesome.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 11 hours.  Little Afrin kept the pipes clean.  Tuesday, woke up, felt kinda bad.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 12 hours.  Little more Afrin kept the pipes sorta clean.  Sneezed on and off all day.  Wednesday, woke up, felt totally like crap.  Really didn't matter, absolutely had to work.  For 11 hours.  Afrin didn't do a damn thing.  Sneezed constantly, used up half a box of Kleenex.  Thursday, woke up, felt like I'd been beaten with a baseball bat.  Didn't matter, had to work.  At 11:00, I turned away from the document I was reading for 2 minutes to read an email, turned back, and couldn't find the place on the page where I stopped reading.  Because none of it was familiar.  Okay, no biggie, started reading from the top.  Halfway through, turned away for another minute to answer another email, turned back, couldn't find my place again.  Realized that my continued presence at work could constitute malpractice, went home.  Where I still worked for another 3 hours, but mostly from the prone position.  Friday, woke up, felt like a bag of smashed assholes, looked even worse than usual (if you can believe it), stayed home.  Took 2 DayQuil and a variety of other stuff.  Worked maybe 4 hours.  Seriously contemplated flushing Blackberry down the toilet so people would stop calling me.\n\nBy supper, I was actually feeling pretty decent.  Not all the way healthy, but better than I had for days.  And my sister-in-law and her fiance were visiting.  So, after a dinner of leftover Chinese food at our place (not my choice, long story), we head out to meet two of sis-in-laws friends.  They also live close to the Mission, so we pick a nearby place I like.  And by place, I mean bar.  And I'm feeling pretty decent, so I drink:\n\n1 mint julep;\n1 Crown & Coke;\n1 12 oz. Watermelon Wheat Beer with a whiskey chaser; and\n1.5 liters of some German beer beloved by the guy in the group from Munich.\n\nNow, just so we're all on the same page, those bottles of Pepsi that sit in your refrigerator door, those are 2 liters.  So I basically drank 75% of one of those, in beer.  Now, at this point, between the massive quantities of pharmaceuticals that are coursing through my veins, and the alcohol, I'm easily not in my right mind.  But I'm not an idiot, and I know that the half-serving of Kang Shao shredded beef I ate 5 hours ago is absolutely not up to the task of fighting off this quantity of alcohol.  Reinforcements are needed.\n\nEnter Pancho Villa Taqueria.  It's basically between the bar and my place, so it's the natural choice.  I split an enchilada dinner with my soon-to-be brother-in-law, wifey and sis split some nachos, and friend and German guy split a burrito.  I also have a watermelon agua fresca, because I think it'll go great with the watermelon wheat beer I had an hour ago.  Plus, I smother the enchiladas with hot sauce and a healthy helping of extra jalapeno slices, because how would that ever come back to haunt me?\n\nFast forward to 5:15 a.m.  I wake up to find that a small army of industrious dwarfs are building a mid-rise, mixed-use building inside my skull.  And it's a problem.  They're violating all sorts of building codes, they don't have the proper permits, and it's not even an approved use for that particular plot of my frontal lobes.  I sit up to have a word with them, and the bed turns 8 or 9 complete circles and dips up and down a few times like a log ride.  I burp 4 or 5 times in rapid succession, and its....watermelon and jalapenos?  Not 2 great tastes that taste great together.  I quickly lay back down and manage to organize a brief union picket that temporarily brings the dwarfs' construction project to a halt.  I am faced with three choices, in descending order of what would actually be a good idea: 1. go to the bathroom and prematurely reintroduce my midnight Mexican meal and accompanying alcoholic pickling juice to the world; 2. go get a drink of water; 3. roll over and go back to sleep and pray things turn out okay.  I try 3, but can't get it to happen, so I compromise on 2.\n\nBottom line: I would probably be in worse shape, but for my trip to Pancho Villa.  That being said, it's now 12 hours later, and I can still taste my meal.  And not in a completely good way.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Wash it all down with a large agua fresca sandia- straight watermelon delight.  ", "Priceless.

At the recommendations of some locals I had inquired from, Pancho Villa was tossed out there, in response to the inquiry \"where can I get some ridiculous, baby-sized burritos from?\"\n\nPancho Villa is conveniently located within a easy brisk walk off of the Market/16th BART stop, and even a tourist like myself was able to find it with ease, and not look so much like an obvious tourist doing such.  Upon arrival during a weekday lunch period, PV apparently has its own security guard up front who doubles as a polite and courteous doorman to hold the door open for guests.\n\nThe interior was bright and festive, and whether he worked at the restaurant, or just wandered around the Mission, singing wherever allows him to do such, there was a guy with a guitar trying to croon some Latin tunes.  Ordering is fairly simple, I ordered the biggest burrito I could think of, with steak in it.  Add the horchata, and lunch was  hair over $10 for me.\n\nServers bring the food to you, and my first impression upon seeing my burrito was that it looked too, well, neat.  It was like a perfect tubular shape, and looked perfectly parallel.  And it wasn't as large as I thought it was going to be; my first burrito in the Bay was from La Tapatia in SSF, and it was a big messy delicious monster.  Pancho Villa's burrito, wrapped in its wrinkle-free foil almost looked like a slice of a pipe.\n\nRegardless, burritos are burritos, and I tore into it and began eating.  The flavors were definitely good, and you could tell the ingredients were fairly fresh.  I killed the rest of the burrito in less time than I thought it would take; whether I was just hungry, or it wasn't as large as I thought it would be is really unmemorable.  The chips were nothing special at all, and I opted to not waste any space in the stomach for future tourist eating.\n\nIt's a convenient location, easily accessible by BART, the staff was friendly, and the service was good.  The food itself was good, but I think it was built up to be more than what I had experienced myself.  With about 3-4 other taquerias within a 2-3 block radius from Pancho Villa, it's hard to say that I would go back so soon, if I ever go back out there again, but for what it's worth, it was a positive experience, and a solid business to get some good food from.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-05-30"}, {"excerpts": ["I also had the horchata, it was not the best I've had - it was grainy."], "author": "Carole R.", "review": "Reportedly one of the best taqueritas in the Mission area by my local friend, and by the throngs of people waiting in line and dining, this is a favorite hot spot.

The RICE, oh my, I will go back and just order that dang rice. I'm used to the orange tinted rice that I normally find in Stockton but this had something else going on that I cannot pin point.

They also have a great ratio of ingredients usually and they come wrapped in two layers of foil. There is a three taco deal for 7$ with your choice of meat. The carne asada wasn't too flavorful, but it was moist and meaty. It wasn't chewy or stringy or anything like that at all. Just missing a little kick is all. They come in double layered flour taco shells, which is pretty much soft and drenched by the time you pick it up if you ordered a meat on it. Orders come with a side of chips whether you are dining in or out. If you order for here, then you'll get extra chips. The salsa bar is so, so, so, so good. Be sure to lap up these award-winning salsas. They're not so chunky or thick sometimes, but boy, what flavor. My favorite is this fresh, bright, thick salsa verde that they have. It's really spicy too. It's seriously one of the best salsas I've had. Also, they have like all the flavors of agua frescas in the world it seems like. While some places will l only have a couple per day, this place has at least six or eight flavors every day and in all range of sizes other than small. Well, they have a small, but it is a regular 8oz. cup. The horchata was super sweet and a little powdery, but definitely taste housemade and just really rich. You can even see litlte bits of coursely ground spices in it.\n\nThis is certainly not a hole in the wall. You can't really miss it and the lines can go through the door. And it's right next to the 16th Street Mission BART Station too. There is almost always a crowd, but there is a lot of seating and the turnover is quick, so don't worry.

I stopped going there.\n\nThis week I found myself in the Mission trying to grab a late night burrito with my honey only to discover that one of my favorite places, El Toro, on the corner of Valencia and 17th (yes, I know it's owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa but it is WORLDS better) is under construction and closed! The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty. The guacamole tasted like someone had literally dumped a whole shaker of salt in there. The saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even finish my burrito half. Past that, the carne asada was so completely bland and tasteless. \n\nIn their defense the service is great, fast, the place is clean and they do have a decent little salsa bar, they still fry their own chips (unlike other taquerias in the Mission), the Horchata is okay, and the musicos playing mariachi is always nice, too.  If only it were as good as it looks. Sigh. But, a good burrito is a good burrito, and alas, Pancho Villa does not a good burrito make.", "rating": 2, "date": "2007-10-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Major burritos, good nachos and pretty tasty horchata most of the time.

"], "author": "Ben P.", "review": "So, here's the thing: I'm a rock star, but I'm also a complete, raving moron, and frequently a danger to myself and others.  Pancho Villa Taqueria is Exhibit 553 in support of this contention.  Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I have previously bitched and moaned about, I've been working hellacious hours lately.  Basically, 10-12 hours days, at least 6 days a week, for two months straight.  But, whatever, it's not like I have a lot of other things going on in my life, so work is a fine way to pass the time.  But, there's a limit on exactly how much of myself I can carve up and give away without repercussions.  On Monday, I woke up, didn't feel all that awesome.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 11 hours.  Little Afrin kept the pipes clean.  Tuesday, woke up, felt kinda bad.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 12 hours.  Little more Afrin kept the pipes sorta clean.  Sneezed on and off all day.  Wednesday, woke up, felt totally like crap.  Really didn't matter, absolutely had to work.  For 11 hours.  Afrin didn't do a damn thing.  Sneezed constantly, used up half a box of Kleenex.  Thursday, woke up, felt like I'd been beaten with a baseball bat.  Didn't matter, had to work.  At 11:00, I turned away from the document I was reading for 2 minutes to read an email, turned back, and couldn't find the place on the page where I stopped reading.  Because none of it was familiar.  Okay, no biggie, started reading from the top.  Halfway through, turned away for another minute to answer another email, turned back, couldn't find my place again.  Realized that my continued presence at work could constitute malpractice, went home.  Where I still worked for another 3 hours, but mostly from the prone position.  Friday, woke up, felt like a bag of smashed assholes, looked even worse than usual (if you can believe it), stayed home.  Took 2 DayQuil and a variety of other stuff.  Worked maybe 4 hours.  Seriously contemplated flushing Blackberry down the toilet so people would stop calling me.\n\nBy supper, I was actually feeling pretty decent.  Not all the way healthy, but better than I had for days.  And my sister-in-law and her fiance were visiting.  So, after a dinner of leftover Chinese food at our place (not my choice, long story), we head out to meet two of sis-in-laws friends.  They also live close to the Mission, so we pick a nearby place I like.  And by place, I mean bar.  And I'm feeling pretty decent, so I drink:\n\n1 mint julep;\n1 Crown & Coke;\n1 12 oz. Watermelon Wheat Beer with a whiskey chaser; and\n1.5 liters of some German beer beloved by the guy in the group from Munich.\n\nNow, just so we're all on the same page, those bottles of Pepsi that sit in your refrigerator door, those are 2 liters.  So I basically drank 75% of one of those, in beer.  Now, at this point, between the massive quantities of pharmaceuticals that are coursing through my veins, and the alcohol, I'm easily not in my right mind.  But I'm not an idiot, and I know that the half-serving of Kang Shao shredded beef I ate 5 hours ago is absolutely not up to the task of fighting off this quantity of alcohol.  Reinforcements are needed.\n\nEnter Pancho Villa Taqueria.  It's basically between the bar and my place, so it's the natural choice.  I split an enchilada dinner with my soon-to-be brother-in-law, wifey and sis split some nachos, and friend and German guy split a burrito.  I also have a watermelon agua fresca, because I think it'll go great with the watermelon wheat beer I had an hour ago.  Plus, I smother the enchiladas with hot sauce and a healthy helping of extra jalapeno slices, because how would that ever come back to haunt me?\n\nFast forward to 5:15 a.m.  I wake up to find that a small army of industrious dwarfs are building a mid-rise, mixed-use building inside my skull.  And it's a problem.  They're violating all sorts of building codes, they don't have the proper permits, and it's not even an approved use for that particular plot of my frontal lobes.  I sit up to have a word with them, and the bed turns 8 or 9 complete circles and dips up and down a few times like a log ride.  I burp 4 or 5 times in rapid succession, and its....watermelon and jalapenos?  Not 2 great tastes that taste great together.  I quickly lay back down and manage to organize a brief union picket that temporarily brings the dwarfs' construction project to a halt.  I am faced with three choices, in descending order of what would actually be a good idea: 1. go to the bathroom and prematurely reintroduce my midnight Mexican meal and accompanying alcoholic pickling juice to the world; 2. go get a drink of water; 3. roll over and go back to sleep and pray things turn out okay.  I try 3, but can't get it to happen, so I compromise on 2.\n\nBottom line: I would probably be in worse shape, but for my trip to Pancho Villa.  That being said, it's now 12 hours later, and I can still taste my meal.

While I do say do your homework and trust the people who have walked the path and know the good places, I'm guessing you likely can't be steered wrong in this awesome neighborhood.  \n\nThe line never dwindled, and the employees have their customer service running like a well oiled machine  - I was very impressed!  As you wait in line, you can see all the beautiful marinated meats grilling and check out various fillings and salsas for whatever meal you choose.  I decided to play it safe and went with the super burrito with carnitas and black beans.  It comes crammed full of all the goodies like sour cream and guac, and is grilled on the outside for an awesome crunch.  A Mexican Coke in a glass bottle (real sugar! YES!) and chips and salsa from the nearby bar completed my meal, all for less than $10.   Despite being busy, we did score a table in their bustling seating area and absolutely chowed down.  Up there with the best burritos I have ever had. \n\nI cannot wait to return to Pancho Villa and the Mission - so much delicious fun!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-12-28"}, {"excerpts": ["This past visit I ordered; my go to Mexican coke, 2 tacos with black beans, one chicken one Al Pastor, I think they were under $2 each!\n\n"], "author": "James S.", "review": "I know, I know.

There I would find Pancho Villa. And so I did, and I was happy...for a while. The demise of their quality began about 4 years ago when I bit into a chile relleno burrito I'd ordered there and it was DISGUSTING! The egg batter-fried shell the chile relleno had was hard, crunchy and too greasy (it's supposed to be supple and smooth with the texture of an omelette), the green chile was hard as well, the seeds hadn't been removed, and the cheese in the chile was chunked inside, not fully melted. Ick. Never again. I stopped going there.\n\nThis week I found myself in the Mission trying to grab a late night burrito with my honey only to discover that one of my favorite places, El Toro, on the corner of Valencia and 17th (yes, I know it's owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa but it is WORLDS better) is under construction and closed! The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty. The guacamole tasted like someone had literally dumped a whole shaker of salt in there. The saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even finish my burrito half. Past that, the carne asada was so completely bland and tasteless. \n\nIn their defense the service is great, fast, the place is clean and they do have a decent little salsa bar, they still fry their own chips (unlike other taquerias in the Mission), the Horchata is okay, and the musicos playing mariachi is always nice, too.

It took me a while to learn how to order a burrito at PV, but now that I've learned all the tricks, I find it really hard to top their burritos. Other places may hypothetically have better burritos, but unless you know how to order it, you're likely to make a wrong choice somewhere and end up with something less than the theoretical best.\n\nSo here are my tips for ordering a burrito at Pancho Villa:\n1. For fillings, go for carnitas, chorizo, grilled veggies, or chile relleno. Although the grilled chicken and carne asada are tempting, because that's what you smell cooking on the grill, I think they're too dry.\n2. When they ask if you want \"mild or hot\" salsa, choose option (c) Molcajete [roasted tomato & chile] or (d) chile verde [tomatillo & avocado]. They're way better than the out-of-season pico de gallo-type \"mild\" and \"hot\" salsas.\n3. All the beans are good. Whether you go for whole (black or pinto) or refried (also black or pinto) is a matter of how moist you want your burrito on a given night.\n4. Unless you can really pack it away, go for a baby burrito. It's still too much burrito for all but the most ravenous appetites, and it'll put your total under $5.\n5. Add cilantro and green onions.

My grandpa was just a boy at the time, but my great grandpa would bring him along when he went boozing. Now that's what I call responsible parenting!\n\nBut what you REALLY care about is the food, so here goes. I've had almost everything on the menu over the years:\n\n- Fish tacos are surprisingly good. The batter is crisp and well seasoned. They top it with shredded cabbage and their house salsa.\n- They have an awesome deal for tacos: 3 tacos for $6. You must pick three of the same taco, but no matter what meat you choose you can't go wrong\n- The enchiladas aren't great. That's because real enchiladas take a long time to make, so they cut corners here.\n- Their Camarones al Diablo platter is hot as a MOFO \n- They have every kind of agua fresca known to man: horchata (cinnamon rice), agua de jamaica (hibiscus), melon, strawberry, pineapple - you name it. \n-  Their churros are good. They have regular 12-inch churros and 6-inch churros filled with custard. Get both! Go nuts!\n- Sometimes guitar players come in and perform. I don't think they're hired by Pancho Villa,  though. They just come in off the street.\n- Lines can get long in the evenings, but you can usually nab a seat without waiting.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't take your kids to bars.

Nevertheless I'm always open to try them every once in a while to see if they've improved.

Once back at my desk, I unwrapped the torta and it looked a little sad and beat up. Although it wasn't the most visually appealing torta, it still had a chance. After a few bites, my conclusion was that it was okay but not great. The bread was toasted nicely and had plenty of melted cheese and the pollo asado was surprisingly great. The lettuce and tomato didn't do much, but luckily I had plenty of salsas to try and add flavor.\n\nThe pinto beans and rice were fine and completed the meal.

There is a security guard at the entrance, which sets the precedent for the type of area you are in. This guard was actually really nice and did his job superbly, escorting a vagabond heckler out of the restaurant without causing a scene and also helping the staff out by cleaning the tables here and there. Back to the food though. The pricing here is super friendly to your wallet and it helps that the food is super delicious too. We were here for dinner on a Friday night and the place was very busy. Initially we had tried to order delivery through Eat24 and Grubhub, but both of these apps were not allowing us to order from here. We think that Pancho Villa ceases app orders during peak dining hours since they are already too occupied with the crowds. They were sporadically taking direct phone orders, so it can be hit or miss for that. I am glad we came in to dine here though because the smells in the air of the restaurant make the food taste even better. I shared the chicken fajita dinner plate, then we also ordered the vegetarian nachos, and carne asada dinner plate, as well as an XL fresa juice (strawberry juice). I did not try the juice, but heard that it was delicious. Getting the food to the table is a bit tricky since the place is so noisy and the ladies working here don't have loud enough voices to shout the order number over the roar of the diners. Even though there are 15 people working the shift, it is wise to stand near the end of the ordering line and wait for the food. It took about 15 minutes for them to get it ready, and we definitely got skipped over in line by the easier orders. It was all worth it in the end. They did give chips while we waited and the salsa bar they have is pretty legitimate. The green salsa had a kick to it, so be careful if you aren't one for spicy food. The meal itself was very tasty! I really liked the chicken because it was the right texture and seasoning. The Mexican rice was also very tasty and I ended up eating it all. Other stuff that came on the dinner plate was beans and a small salad. All of this ended up being plenty of food for two people. We did have to purchase one extra tortilla to finish up the fajitas though. Overall, an absolutely worth it taqueria to eat at in SF.

I guess averaging the good with the bad, I can only give a solid \"A-OK\" three star.  Maybe there's a reason why the only Mexican people there were the ones behind the counter...\n\nTaco: The basic taco is a corn tortilla from a bag (don't get me started about how freshly griddled tortillas are superior) with your choice of bean (black, refried, pinto) and salsa (if they remember to add it).  Pretty basic and boring so the true success or failure falls solely on the meat filling.\n\nCarnitas: Probably the best thing going at this joint.  There were wisps of pulled pork: some crispy and some succulent.  I devoured this is no time. \n\nPastor: Good seasoning, but the texture was too soft.  I prefer when pastor has really crispy outsides to add a super BBQed experience.\n\nPollo Asado: I ordered the carne asada (which they were preparing fresh), but the tacotress decided to give me chicken instead.  It was way too dry and had no flavor.  Major boo!\n\nCorn Quesadilla: This really sucked.  They used the corn tortillas from a bag and just melted bland white cheese in between.  The tortilla wasn't even brown and the salsa mentioned on the menu was no where to be found.\n\nNachos & Salsa: The nachos were a bit too thick which caused them to house too much oil.  The salsa bar was pretty amazing though.  So many choices, I think I only got through half.

I noticed that they  had a security guard at the door starting at 5. That definitely makes sure that there's a certain level of safety that you can't always guarantee at other places in the mission.

Pancho Villa Taqueria is Exhibit 553 in support of this contention.  Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I have previously bitched and moaned about, I've been working hellacious hours lately.  Basically, 10-12 hours days, at least 6 days a week, for two months straight.  But, whatever, it's not like I have a lot of other things going on in my life, so work is a fine way to pass the time.  But, there's a limit on exactly how much of myself I can carve up and give away without repercussions.  On Monday, I woke up, didn't feel all that awesome.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 11 hours.  Little Afrin kept the pipes clean.  Tuesday, woke up, felt kinda bad.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 12 hours.  Little more Afrin kept the pipes sorta clean.  Sneezed on and off all day.  Wednesday, woke up, felt totally like crap.  Really didn't matter, absolutely had to work.  For 11 hours.  Afrin didn't do a damn thing.  Sneezed constantly, used up half a box of Kleenex.  Thursday, woke up, felt like I'd been beaten with a baseball bat.  Didn't matter, had to work.  At 11:00, I turned away from the document I was reading for 2 minutes to read an email, turned back, and couldn't find the place on the page where I stopped reading.  Because none of it was familiar.  Okay, no biggie, started reading from the top.  Halfway through, turned away for another minute to answer another email, turned back, couldn't find my place again.  Realized that my continued presence at work could constitute malpractice, went home.  Where I still worked for another 3 hours, but mostly from the prone position.  Friday, woke up, felt like a bag of smashed assholes, looked even worse than usual (if you can believe it), stayed home.  Took 2 DayQuil and a variety of other stuff.  Worked maybe 4 hours.  Seriously contemplated flushing Blackberry down the toilet so people would stop calling me.\n\nBy supper, I was actually feeling pretty decent.  Not all the way healthy, but better than I had for days.  And my sister-in-law and her fiance were visiting.  So, after a dinner of leftover Chinese food at our place (not my choice, long story), we head out to meet two of sis-in-laws friends.  They also live close to the Mission, so we pick a nearby place I like.  And by place, I mean bar.  And I'm feeling pretty decent, so I drink:\n\n1 mint julep;\n1 Crown & Coke;\n1 12 oz. Watermelon Wheat Beer with a whiskey chaser; and\n1.5 liters of some German beer beloved by the guy in the group from Munich.\n\nNow, just so we're all on the same page, those bottles of Pepsi that sit in your refrigerator door, those are 2 liters.  So I basically drank 75% of one of those, in beer.  Now, at this point, between the massive quantities of pharmaceuticals that are coursing through my veins, and the alcohol, I'm easily not in my right mind.  But I'm not an idiot, and I know that the half-serving of Kang Shao shredded beef I ate 5 hours ago is absolutely not up to the task of fighting off this quantity of alcohol.  Reinforcements are needed.\n\nEnter Pancho Villa Taqueria.  It's basically between the bar and my place, so it's the natural choice.  I split an enchilada dinner with my soon-to-be brother-in-law, wifey and sis split some nachos, and friend and German guy split a burrito.  I also have a watermelon agua fresca, because I think it'll go great with the watermelon wheat beer I had an hour ago.  Plus, I smother the enchiladas with hot sauce and a healthy helping of extra jalapeno slices, because how would that ever come back to haunt me?\n\nFast forward to 5:15 a.m.  I wake up to find that a small army of industrious dwarfs are building a mid-rise, mixed-use building inside my skull.  And it's a problem.  They're violating all sorts of building codes, they don't have the proper permits, and it's not even an approved use for that particular plot of my frontal lobes.  I sit up to have a word with them, and the bed turns 8 or 9 complete circles and dips up and down a few times like a log ride.  I burp 4 or 5 times in rapid succession, and its....watermelon and jalapenos?  Not 2 great tastes that taste great together.  I quickly lay back down and manage to organize a brief union picket that temporarily brings the dwarfs' construction project to a halt.  I am faced with three choices, in descending order of what would actually be a good idea: 1. go to the bathroom and prematurely reintroduce my midnight Mexican meal and accompanying alcoholic pickling juice to the world; 2. go get a drink of water; 3. roll over and go back to sleep and pray things turn out okay.  I try 3, but can't get it to happen, so I compromise on 2.\n\nBottom line: I would probably be in worse shape, but for my trip to Pancho Villa.  That being said, it's now 12 hours later, and I can still taste my meal.  And not in a completely good way.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Their dry, stale nachos, though not quite prison food, are lowly.

It is actually one of the weakest, if not the actual weakest of the bunch, though they do a couple of things very well.\n\nWhy, then, does it have lines out the door and constant crowds? \n\nLaziness and herd mentality. Think about it:  where is Pancho Villa located? Exactly between BART and the Valencia area bars where it is presently fashionable to get drunk. And people love to rationalize, they won't say \"We're settling for this because it's convenient, and we settle for it every weekend.\" No--- That would be admitting to second best. So they say \"You have to come with us to this exceptional Taqueria we discovered while exploring. It is the best that this edgy new neighborhood we found called 'the Mission' has to offer...\" And there is no reasoning with the intoxicated. \n\nPancho Villa over-salts everything. I feel closer to a stroke every time I eat one of their soggy, inconsistent, assembly-line burritos while sitting on their broken, uncomfortable seats. A lot of salt is one thing. A whole god-damn salt-lick is another. Their dry, stale nachos, though not quite prison food, are lowly. (In the indignant words of the late Matt \"Uncle Matty\" Oreto, \"How do you fuck up nachos!?\")\n\nAs alternatives, Mariachi's has a much wider selection of much better-crafted Burritos for about the same price, with accompanying novelties like mango salsa. And if it's basic Mission-authentic you want, go around the corner to El Castillito, next to the porno store on Mission--- solid, cheap, real.\n\nNow, that said, Pancho Villa makes a very, very good quesadilla. The prawn quesadilla is great, while the juicy garlic-mushroom quesadilla verges on excellent. So it's not like there isn't a reason to go there every now and again. \n\nTheir much-touted salsa bar is pretty damn good, too, though it is inconsistent, and they seem to change salsa recipies at random.\n\nAs a parting shot, though, back about a year and a half ago, when the city's living wage measure passed, Pancho Villa was the first restaurant that I observed in San Francisco to take it out of their customer's hides by jacking their prices.

Initially we had tried to order delivery through Eat24 and Grubhub, but both of these apps were not allowing us to order from here. We think that Pancho Villa ceases app orders during peak dining hours since they are already too occupied with the crowds.

For this review, we will concentrate on the gold standard of measuring taquerias, the carne asada burrito. \n\nOf all the top Mission burrito joints, Pancho Villa Taqueria offers the most burrito customization options by far. Diners have choices of meat (carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, al pastor, spicy pollo, pollo chile verde, pork chile verde, tofu ranchero, lengua, steak fajitas, and pollo fajitas), beans (refried pinto, whole pinto, black whole, and black refried), tortilla (flour, whole wheat, red chile, and spinach), and salsa (mild or hot pico, molcajete stone ground, fire roasted arbol chile, and pastor roasted). \n\nA regular burrito ($7.00) sports your choice of meat, rice, beans, and salsa. The deluxe ($7.50) adds cheese. The especial ($8.00) will get you guacamole. The super ($9.00) scores you sour cream, lettuce, and tomato. \n\nWith a steamed tortilla, the carne asada burrito was sizable, but not overwhelming. Ordered spicy, it was quite piquant, but slightly dry, needing some salsa to give it the right consistency. Good sized chunks of steak were plentiful and there was a good mix of ingredients in each bite. \n\nA small portion of chips is complimentary with your burrito, perfect to sample the award-winning selections on the large salsa bar.\n\nPancho Villa Taqueria also offers a myriad of drink choices, including sodas ($1.00), Mexicoke ($2.50), and Aguas frescas ($2.00, $2.50, $3.00, and $3.50) as well as domestic ($3.50) and Mexican ($4.00) beers. \n\nThe line can sometimes be long, but it moves quickly.

I have no complaints about the quality of the food, and for a burrito joint I'd normally give them 4 stars.\n\nProblem is, a few months ago they changed to a different order system. It used to be the standard \"order from the girl who's making you the food\", and thus it was easy to specifiy \"I want this much rice, beans, salsa etc\" as she made it. Now it's \"order from the order-taker who has to enter your order into the computer which prints out the order for the girls to prepare\" and it's NEVER right.\n\nI've eaten there at least 2 dozen times since they've instituted this new system and literally, EVERY single time there is something WRONG with my order, something that never happened before when I interacted with the girl actually preparing my food.\n\nSmall example of how the new system sucks: occasionally I like prawn burritos. Previously, when I ordered one, the girl would tell the cook to start the prawns, and he would, and in the meantime she'd prepare the burrito. She'd always be done before him, so my burrito would be filled with hot and perfectly cooked prawns. Under the new system, I order the same burrito, but it gets queued. The order goes to the cook who starts the prawns, but the girls don't start preparing the burrito until AFTER the prawns are done, but they still sit there on the grille while they prepare the other ingredients. This means the prawns cook for an additional few minutes, and prawns cook so quickly that I now get hard rubbery prawns.\n\nAnother example: I like to go light on the rice and beans so as not to load up on carbs. In person, it's easy to say \"a bit less please\" but it's difficult to convey \"light rice/beans\" to the order taker, because although the computer system might allow it, each girl has their own idea of what \"light\" means, and thus my order ranges from way too much to slightly too much. Never happened under the old system.\n\nUpdate 6-2015: I've been eating off and on at PV since the last review, and that review still stands, but I'm downgrading the rating because the problem I described has just gotten worse and worse.

When the burrito arrived, the first thing I did was to pat it with my hands because it was hefty and made me excited. It passed the \"can it stand upright on its own?\" test too. The initial bite was great, but was soon met with the slightly soggy crunch of lettuce. NO burrito should EVER have lettuce. It becomes a soggy mess with the heat of the meat. And if it doesn't become soggy it means your burrito is COLD. Throw extra onions and cilantro in there instead if you must add \"filler\". \nFor this reason (the lettuce) and the fact that the meat was a bit dry, I had to knock some stars off. I think if I ordered it with no lettuce I'd have a different experience. Oh, also their Spanish rice has peas in it. \n\nAnyways. If you upgrade something to \"super\" make sure to leave out the lettuce (this includes quesadillas as well). The salsa verde with avocado is great though!! \n\nService here exceeds a typical Mexican joint.

The chips were made fresh and was really good.\n\nBecause I did not grow up on Mexican food, I thought it was good, not spectacular, but good.  My husband and sister could only finish half of their super burrito.

Although, I wish the pieces of meat were chopped into smaller pieces since it was a little difficult to take small bites and it was a mouthful every time. There is a perfect amount of everything that balances the flavors out. There is a huge selection of sauces and you should definitely try all of it. Most of the sauces are spicy, so if you can't handle spicy, watch out!\n\nAtmosphere: Seating might be difficult and there is a security guarding the door as it gets later. Seating might be a little hard to find even though the place is big, but the tables clear fast since the bussers are working quickly to clean the tables for the next customers. This place could get so packed, there is even a line to leave the restaurant! \n\nService: When you go to a casual place like this for a quick bite and casual place, you wouldn't expect much service. Even on a busy Friday night, the workers here seem energetic and were friendly even though some might have language barrier. The guy packaging up to-go orders asked me what my number was even though I only waited for a few minutes. He told my my order would be out quickly and told me where my number on the receipt was since I was unsure where it was stated. We asked the busser lady collecting our dirty dishes if the chips were free and she told us it was and encouraged us to go to the counter to ask for more.\n\nFor a beer and a super burrito, my meal came out to be less than $12!

Had no idea this place was so popular, a group of seven of us came for a quick dinner before bowling on Friday and we were so lucky to miss the long line!\n\nFOOD- friend raved about the shrimp taco so of course I had to try it! The taco was nicely wrapped (to my surprise!) and filed with coleslaw, the few shrimps inside were crispy and bouncy, flavor was pretty good, but I was not wow'ed. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised by the fish taco. The large pieces of fish was cooked just right, moist, and delicious with some salsa added on top. I can imagine that both tacos would taste better if I got it 'super' with avocado etc. I liked the fact that your order comes with free chips and you go to retrieve whatever/however much salsa from the back counter. Other friends ordered burritos and shrimp super tacos, which they enjoyed.\n\nSPACE- large brightly-lit space with lots of seating. The small stools make for a casual atmosphere but good luck if you have a large jacket that you took off because it was so hot/stuffy inside and hope for more luck if you also have a purse to carry and did not want to place it on the not so clean floor. :( Bathroom was not that clean and appeared to have flooded all over. We later found out that it was 'just cleaned'. Maybe someone just decided to pour water over everything- the toilet, toilet seat, toilet tank, and floors to 'clean it'. I would avoid using the bathroom if possible.\n\nSERVICE/PRICE- friendly staff and the ordering process was quick and easy. Line may get long, but it moves pretty fast. They take your order, you pay, they they prepare your food per your receipt/order. Shrimp taco was $3.50 and fish taco was $3. They are of decent size, but not quite enough to fill me up.

Yes, I've been to La Taqueria many times and know they were voted best burrito in America, but I think Pancho Villa wins on several fronts: price, meat, moistness of burrito, salsa, and they take credit cards. All pluses in my book.\n\nFirst, the burritos are totally reasonably priced. You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias. I also love the salsa bar, with around 10 options of salsa to pick from. They seem to have won a ton of awards on their salsa. La Taq doesn't give you salsas with your food, and it even sucks more when you get takeout there because there are no to-go containers for salsa.\n\nAnd lastly, seating is fairly abundant so you don't have to fight for tables.

I recognized the name immediately because they have another location in San Mateo, where I ate several times last summer. I already knew the San Mateo Pancho Villa had amazing burritos, so I decided to check out this place.\n\nThe first time I went to the San Mateo location, I ordered a chicken mole super burrito to go. I picked up the burrito and chips after they called something that sounded like my order number. I walked for about 10 minutes to get back to the place where I was staying, and as soon as I bit into the burrito, I realized it contained shrimp, not chicken. Whoops.

I also ordered a mango agua fresca, which was great.\n\nBut of course, there was a mix-up with my order. I was order #336, and the entire thing should have cost about $10. When I paid, they gave me a receipt saying that mine was order #326, and it cost only about $8. I pointed out the discrepancy to them, and the cashier said something along the lines of, \"What? I gave you a burrito...it's not like you ordered a quesadilla, \u00bfverdad?\". Whoops.

I would have preferred the fish to be a little bit more crispy - it felt more like a steamed or broiled fish rather than a grilled fish...I'd say fry it and you'd have a perfect dish. Also, would have liked a little more heat, but the salsa bar does a fine job of adding that.\n\nThe burrito, to me, was one of the top burritos in the bay area. The carne asada is mixed with green bell peppers and seasoned to the point where the burrito became a melting pot of ingredients where everything had the succulent flavor of the meat. From the rice to the lettuce to the cheese, the sour cream, the salsa...everything oozed carne asada. I couldn't stop eating it.

The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing.

I was left in a brief state of wonder. How to approach eating this masterpiece with ingredient proportionate mouthfuls and limited spillage? I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50.

I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35).

Yes, I've been to La Taqueria many times and know they were voted best burrito in America, but I think Pancho Villa wins on several fronts: price, meat, moistness of burrito, salsa, and they take credit cards. All pluses in my book.\n\nFirst, the burritos are totally reasonably priced. You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias. I also love the salsa bar, with around 10 options of salsa to pick from. They seem to have won a ton of awards on their salsa. La Taq doesn't give you salsas with your food, and it even sucks more when you get takeout there because there are no to-go containers for salsa.\n\nAnd lastly, seating is fairly abundant so you don't have to fight for tables.

They're accepting WAY too many online orders.  There were bags and bags of orders getting stacked up on the shelves meanwhile in-store customers and stressed out employees were getting the shaft.  \n\n***Edit: One thing I forgot to include in my original review is that when you use online apps to order your food for pick up and choose to leave a tip, that tip doesn't necessarily go to the workers!  I used the Eat24 app to order food from another restaurant.  When I picked up the food I asked the employee if they get the tips and they said NO.   I was really angry when I learned this because I had left so many tips before thinking it would go directly to the employees and not the owners. So, if you do use an online app, always leave your tip in cash in the tip jar onsite or hand it to the employee who hands you your food if there's no tip jar there!***\n\nThere was a huge crowd of customers waiting for food for what seemed like forever.  Right after I finally got my food, another customer starting yelling at the poor guy behind the counter that he wanted his money back because he was tired of waiting so long.  Shame on you owners for being so greedy.  Pancho Villa was so much better in the old days when the person you ordered your food from was the person who prepared it.  This always guaranteed that once you ordered, you'd always have your food within 5 minutes. Things really went downhill when they started their new system of taking orders from just one person and then the army of people behind prepares it.   The online ordering system has made things even worse. I recommend that if they want to keep accepting online orders, they return to their old method of taking in-store orders where the person you order from makes your food.

It took me a while to learn how to order a burrito at PV, but now that I've learned all the tricks, I find it really hard to top their burritos. Other places may hypothetically have better burritos, but unless you know how to order it, you're likely to make a wrong choice somewhere and end up with something less than the theoretical best.\n\nSo here are my tips for ordering a burrito at Pancho Villa:\n1. For fillings, go for carnitas, chorizo, grilled veggies, or chile relleno. Although the grilled chicken and carne asada are tempting, because that's what you smell cooking on the grill, I think they're too dry.\n2. When they ask if you want \"mild or hot\" salsa, choose option (c) Molcajete [roasted tomato & chile] or (d) chile verde [tomatillo & avocado]. They're way better than the out-of-season pico de gallo-type \"mild\" and \"hot\" salsas.\n3. All the beans are good. Whether you go for whole (black or pinto) or refried (also black or pinto) is a matter of how moist you want your burrito on a given night.\n4. Unless you can really pack it away, go for a baby burrito. It's still too much burrito for all but the most ravenous appetites, and it'll put your total under $5.\n5. Add cilantro and green onions.

Because it was Father's Day and my brother-in-laws favorite meal is Mexican food, I was hoping he would have taken us to a taco truck. But no such luck.  Instead, the last 1-hour, for dinner, before heading to the airport, was spent at his favorite Mexican restaurant, Pancho Villa Taqueria.\n\nPancho's is in the Mission district.  Back in 2002, I had a somewhat of a frightening experience in the Mission.  So I was dreading going into that part of the city.  No matter how much gentrification and rehabilitation this part of town is going through, I the incident is so clear to me that it felt like it just happened a few hours ago.\n\nSunday, wasn't to bad in the city.  Although we had to park 3 short blocks away, we were able to find parking rather quickly.  And I wasn't too fearful walking to the restaurant because my husband was with me.  But he made damn sure that I wore my purse as a crossbody instead of my usual left shoulder.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant and this place is busy.  Most tables were full.  Many families were there enjoying dinner.  Plenty of people waiting for their orders to be completed.  So that means, we are at the tail end of the rush.  \n\nI chose the chicken flautas plate, while my brother-in-law got his usual three tacos with prawns, my husband and sister got the super burrito. So although my husband checked in on Yelp to use the $2 off deal on the super burrito, they didn't apply it.  A negative but not enough to ruin our family time together.  My brother-in-law asked my sister how much his tacos were. I can't remember how much it was, but they charged $1 more for the prawns for each of his tacos.  When we told him the price, he was shocked.  Later he says, during the weekdays, they have \"happy hour\" where those same tacos are cheaper.  \n\nWhat was free you ask? Chips and salsa bar.  The chips were made fresh and was really good.\n\nBecause I did not grow up on Mexican food, I thought it was good, not spectacular, but good.  My husband and sister could only finish half of their super burrito. And because we were flying home, we gave all of our leftovers to the sister, even if she kept trying to push it on me to take it home.\n\nAnd although I don't believe we did anything wrong, one of the cooks was mad dogging our table.  I chalk that up to being a cultural difference thing, but lucky my husband's back was facing towards them and of course I didn't tell him.  It would have been a bad situation and I didn't want to ruin a beautiful day.

(listed at the bottom) is my least favorite. \n\nWhen I look at reviews sometimes just want to know where to go or how a user compares one venue against another to see if we have similar tastes. If you're curious, I have rankings for Boba, Bakeries and Ramen , Chicken and Waffles as well (random right?)  Follow my profile to see my most recent reviews.

Borrowing from each other's experience and artistry, they created the resounding culture that is the Mission District today.\n\nThe murals are still around, and so are remnants of the sound and music that defined the Mission. But you look around and see that they are sandwiched by $4 lattes, Kale smoothies, and gluten-free breakfast. Holy smokes! Has the Mission gentrified into a new playground for those sweater-wearing, software-programming hipsters?!?\n\nToday I'm sitting down with Holden Caulfield at Pancho Villa Tacqueria. You may remember Holden from your high school literature class as a judgmental teenager upset with the world. Well, he hasn't changed much. Holden handpicked Pancho Villa for our meeting place because he claims it is part of a group of diminishing authentic eateries in the Mission. The appetizing smell of meat that hangs over the air convinces me that this is a good choice regardless.\n\n(So Holden, what makes Pancho Villa authentic? What is authenticity anyway?)\n\nHe pour a healthy dose of green salsa onto his Chicken Quesadilla as he answers.\n\n\"The most superficial, yet undoubtedly reliable indicator of authenticity is the lack of hipsters working in this establishment.\"\n\nI look over to the counter and realize at once that there are no hipsters to be found. Not one fedora. Holden smirks and continues.\n\n\"Authenticity cannot really be replicated, right? Or else it wouldn't be authentic. And I'm sure you've had better Mexican food than that delicious Al Pastor burrito you're holding because the Chef probably went on a Mexico pilgrimage to find out all there is to know about Tacos. I mean he knows exactly the right temperature to cook the meat and the exact amount of toppings to bring out the most flavor. Golly, he knows more about tacos than a majority of Mexicans probably.\"\n\nHe bites into the Quesadilla and lets the string of melted cheese linger from the tip of his mouth as he goes on.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, authenticity to a Mexican person is what grandma makes. Forget all the taco bullet points on the Chef's Macbook Pro because authenticity is whatever grandma decides that day. She might not even know half the stuff the Chef knows. And to me, anyone trying that hard to replicate something is well, kinda phony.\"\n\nAnd there it is, Holden's favorite word. Phony. I can't help but smile.\n\n(Okay Holden, but what's wrong with phony? This authentic burrito from Pancho Villa is unbelievably juicy and amazingly delicious, and so is that \"phony\" pork belly taco I had a couple of weeks ago. What is the problem?)\n\n\"The problem is that phony pork belly taco costs $10 a pop. Look, I am all about borrowing from other cultures and transforming it into something new, and maybe even something better. It's what makes America great.\"\n\nHolden pauses and opens up his receipt to show me his whole Quesadilla only costs $10. He resumes.\n \n\"But people have to realize that the community they are borrowing from do not have a strong presence in the 6-figure Silicon Valley circle. And if you have an ethnic restaurant with prices that are generally economically unrealistic for that particular ethnic group, then what the hell is that? It certainly IS NOT embracing that culture.\" \n\n(It sounds like we are getting into the topic of gentrification. The Mission was a rough place to be at 10 years ago. It is now a thriving and bustling neighborhood, and I'm sure even Pancho Villa is benefiting. Can't we give the hipster some credit?)\n\nHolden shrugs as if forced to agree.\n\n\"Yes, they deserve a lot of credit. And yes, I do love the Rebel Within and I may very well be addicted to Earl Grey ice cream and all, but for Chrissake they're driving out the community that makes the Mission the Mission!\"\n\n(But the increased rent prices is just Supply and Demand.)\n\n\"And I love it when economics come into play.

What makes them special is they butterfly the shrimps which make the shrimp chunkier in the taco. The prawns had a buttery taste to them. The salmon taco is what I also recommend as they are tender and juicy. The other items where ok. If they have lengua as one of the meat choices then they should have tripitas and cabeza.

All the other reviewers are right who say it was great before, but the quality dropped years ago.\n\nI think the proximity to BART is getting this place positive reviews that it just doesn't deserve -- neither on quality, ambience, or service (they have easily enough staff to roll your burrito off the line around the time you're ready to pay, like so many other counter-style taquerias, but instead they give you a number and your food takes five minutes longer for no apparent reason other than backup that exists only because they made the poor decision to use a number system).\n\nWalk 3 blocks to better goods and you'll be glad you did.\n\nLet me explain what I really mean just so you don't think I'm being negative for no reason. Pancho Villa puts all the right things in their burritos, it all looks good behind the counter, but when you get down to eating, their cooking just isn't that good after all. If Mission burrito and taco reviews were actually well balanced and not thrown off by BART locations and other factors, Pancho Villa would get two stars.

We were pressed for time, so I didn't get a good look to see what all consisted of the taco- I had to devour it quickly.  I do know there were beans, salsa, guac, sour cream, and a shining beam of light from heaven.  Oh, and some raw onions I picked off.\n\nIs everything legitimately vegetarian?  I'm not sure and they were too busy to play 101 Veggie Questions with me.

Pretty basic and boring so the true success or failure falls solely on the meat filling.\n\nCarnitas: Probably the best thing going at this joint.  There were wisps of pulled pork: some crispy and some succulent.  I devoured this is no time. \n\nPastor: Good seasoning, but the texture was too soft.  I prefer when pastor has really crispy outsides to add a super BBQed experience.\n\nPollo Asado: I ordered the carne asada (which they were preparing fresh), but the tacotress decided to give me chicken instead.  It was way too dry and had no flavor.  Major boo!\n\nCorn Quesadilla: This really sucked.  They used the corn tortillas from a bag and just melted bland white cheese in between.  The tortilla wasn't even brown and the salsa mentioned on the menu was no where to be found.\n\nNachos & Salsa: The nachos were a bit too thick which caused them to house too much oil.  The salsa bar was pretty amazing though.  So many choices, I think I only got through half.  Too many to review individually, but each one tasty and uniquely different from the rest.\n\nJamaica Agua Refresca: Wish they had said this was tea explicitly.  I was expecting a fruit punch.

In my experience, the ingredients are consistent and quality.  I have had no issues, quite to the contrary in fact.  This is still some of the better tasting Mexican American food I've ever had.

She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention.

I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention.

Think about it:  where is Pancho Villa located? Exactly between BART and the Valencia area bars where it is presently fashionable to get drunk. And people love to rationalize, they won't say \"We're settling for this because it's convenient, and we settle for it every weekend.\" No--- That would be admitting to second best.

I feel closer to a stroke every time I eat one of their soggy, inconsistent, assembly-line burritos while sitting on their broken, uncomfortable seats. A lot of salt is one thing. A whole god-damn salt-lick is another. Their dry, stale nachos, though not quite prison food, are lowly.

And if it's basic Mission-authentic you want, go around the corner to El Castillito, next to the porno store on Mission--- solid, cheap, real.\n\nNow, that said, Pancho Villa makes a very, very good quesadilla. The prawn quesadilla is great, while the juicy garlic-mushroom quesadilla verges on excellent. So it's not like there isn't a reason to go there every now and again. \n\nTheir much-touted salsa bar is pretty damn good, too, though it is inconsistent, and they seem to change salsa recipies at random.\n\nAs a parting shot, though, back about a year and a half ago, when the city's living wage measure passed, Pancho Villa was the first restaurant that I observed in San Francisco to take it out of their customer's hides by jacking their prices.

It has an open kitchen so you can have a look for yourself. \n\nI ordered the super burrito with carne asada. When the burrito arrived, the first thing I did was to pat it with my hands because it was hefty and made me excited. It passed the \"can it stand upright on its own?\" test too. The initial bite was great, but was soon met with the slightly soggy crunch of lettuce. NO burrito should EVER have lettuce. It becomes a soggy mess with the heat of the meat. And if it doesn't become soggy it means your burrito is COLD. Throw extra onions and cilantro in there instead if you must add \"filler\". \nFor this reason (the lettuce) and the fact that the meat was a bit dry, I had to knock some stars off. I think if I ordered it with no lettuce I'd have a different experience. Oh, also their Spanish rice has peas in it. \n\nAnyways. If you upgrade something to \"super\" make sure to leave out the lettuce (this includes quesadillas as well).

Yes, I've been to La Taqueria many times and know they were voted best burrito in America, but I think Pancho Villa wins on several fronts: price, meat, moistness of burrito, salsa, and they take credit cards. All pluses in my book.\n\nFirst, the burritos are totally reasonably priced. You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias.

La Taq doesn't give you salsas with your food, and it even sucks more when you get takeout there because there are no to-go containers for salsa.\n\nAnd lastly, seating is fairly abundant so you don't have to fight for tables.

When I crave for it, I just take off one order from my freezer, reheat it in the microwave and it's good to go! Never liked this menu elsewhere than here.

There is a security guard at the entrance, which sets the precedent for the type of area you are in. This guard was actually really nice and did his job superbly, escorting a vagabond heckler out of the restaurant without causing a scene and also helping the staff out by cleaning the tables here and there. Back to the food though. The pricing here is super friendly to your wallet and it helps that the food is super delicious too. We were here for dinner on a Friday night and the place was very busy. Initially we had tried to order delivery through Eat24 and Grubhub, but both of these apps were not allowing us to order from here. We think that Pancho Villa ceases app orders during peak dining hours since they are already too occupied with the crowds. They were sporadically taking direct phone orders, so it can be hit or miss for that. I am glad we came in to dine here though because the smells in the air of the restaurant make the food taste even better. I shared the chicken fajita dinner plate, then we also ordered the vegetarian nachos, and carne asada dinner plate, as well as an XL fresa juice (strawberry juice). I did not try the juice, but heard that it was delicious. Getting the food to the table is a bit tricky since the place is so noisy and the ladies working here don't have loud enough voices to shout the order number over the roar of the diners. Even though there are 15 people working the shift, it is wise to stand near the end of the ordering line and wait for the food. It took about 15 minutes for them to get it ready, and we definitely got skipped over in line by the easier orders. It was all worth it in the end. They did give chips while we waited and the salsa bar they have is pretty legitimate. The green salsa had a kick to it, so be careful if you aren't one for spicy food. The meal itself was very tasty! I really liked the chicken because it was the right texture and seasoning. The Mexican rice was also very tasty and I ended up eating it all. Other stuff that came on the dinner plate was beans and a small salad. All of this ended up being plenty of food for two people. We did have to purchase one extra tortilla to finish up the fajitas though. Overall, an absolutely worth it taqueria to eat at in SF.

It used to be the standard \"order from the girl who's making you the food\", and thus it was easy to specifiy \"I want this much rice, beans, salsa etc\" as she made it. Now it's \"order from the order-taker who has to enter your order into the computer which prints out the order for the girls to prepare\" and it's NEVER right.\n\nI've eaten there at least 2 dozen times since they've instituted this new system and literally, EVERY single time there is something WRONG with my order, something that never happened before when I interacted with the girl actually preparing my food.\n\nSmall example of how the new system sucks: occasionally I like prawn burritos. Previously, when I ordered one, the girl would tell the cook to start the prawns, and he would, and in the meantime she'd prepare the burrito. She'd always be done before him, so my burrito would be filled with hot and perfectly cooked prawns. Under the new system, I order the same burrito, but it gets queued. The order goes to the cook who starts the prawns, but the girls don't start preparing the burrito until AFTER the prawns are done, but they still sit there on the grille while they prepare the other ingredients. This means the prawns cook for an additional few minutes, and prawns cook so quickly that I now get hard rubbery prawns.\n\nAnother example: I like to go light on the rice and beans so as not to load up on carbs. In person, it's easy to say \"a bit less please\" but it's difficult to convey \"light rice/beans\" to the order taker, because although the computer system might allow it, each girl has their own idea of what \"light\" means, and thus my order ranges from way too much to slightly too much.

Do you know what it's like to live in the Bay Area for 7 years and then not have a good burrito for what seems like an eternity...I didn't think so.\n\nBecause of it's location near 16th and Mission BART and late hours, I have always thought of Pancho Villa as being the more \"main stream\" taqueria in the neighborhood. Everyone knows where it is and goes there now and again, but I am pretty positive most folks don't live in the Mission that go there. Ok, Mission local snobbery apparently has not left me. Part of its popularity may be it's larger, more well lit and less \"grimy\" than other taqurias in the area so non-locals are more comfortable. \n\nThat being said, the chile relleno burrito I had last night was AWESOME! The chile relleno itself was perfectly cooked, the cheese melted in my mouth and the rest of the burrito ingredients were top notch (oh, how I love the rice in a mission burrito!). Maybe at the end of my trip after many other burritos I will think differently, but I had a great experience last night. The salsa bar has always been one of the highlights of this place. They have 8-12 different award winning salsas available and the free chips we perfectly crispy. Not only that but I ran into a friend, which generally happens around 10PM at Pancho Villa. It can get busy in there (due to the many bars in the area and post-buzz/mid-drinking session munchies), but it's not as crazy as El Faralito where insane stuff happens around 1 AM. Everyone should check that out once or twice. I heard once that El Toro was owned by the same people as Pancho Villa and is basically the same business, just in a smaller location a couple blocks away, but I'm not sure if that was true. I will be visiting El Buen Sabor (fav), El Faralito (second fav), and even Cancun (hated it for a while but the quesadilla's are great) on this trip so we'll see how I feel when I get back to NYC, but I would recommend Pancho Villa to anyone who wants a solid late night dinner (and doesn't want to take the time to see what else is open).", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-08-13"}, {"excerpts": ["The meats are average, rice powdery and beans too watery to merit the $9 price tag for a super burrito.

Though it's not part of a global conglomeration that is contributing heftily to American obesity and monopolizing nourishment on an international scale, the product is similarly bland, less-than-extraordinary and yet still wildly popular. Even worse for the San Francisco institution is that it's shockingly overpriced. The meats are average, rice powdery and beans too watery to merit the $9 price tag for a super burrito. Moreover, I'm not entirely comfortable eating my expensive burri in front of an armed security guard.\n\nSo Pancho Villa doesn't compare to the negative impact Chipotle has on our global economy, our stomach, and some would say our underwears, but it's still vastly overrated and just not good enough.

The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing. Salmon, soon to be in someone's seafood burrito, is grilled before my eyes. I usually like to go through the meats first and then expand whence my proposed essentials are covered.\n\nChar-broiled steak, black refried beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, lettuce and bits of radish are piled high on a small doubly layered tortilla foundation to make my carne asada super taco ($4).

I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers. He also holds a slightly beat up pink teddy bear with an early Valentine's Day premise to be sure. The mother of the family sitting next to us bought her self a rose. Her husband looked on while a broad smile spread across her face. \n\nNow lets talk about what put a smile on my face. I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention. The Aguas Frescas are served in Greenware cups. Upon finishing a meal, the most prominent options are to recycle and compost leftovers. I revel in the taqueria's proactive eco attitude, unlike such unnamed businesses who \"urge\" one to recycle but do not even supply a recycling bin on premises.\n\nPerched on the back wall, a statue of Pancho Villa happily surveys the crowd with gun in hand.

There I would find Pancho Villa. And so I did, and I was happy...for a while. The demise of their quality began about 4 years ago when I bit into a chile relleno burrito I'd ordered there and it was DISGUSTING! The egg batter-fried shell the chile relleno had was hard, crunchy and too greasy (it's supposed to be supple and smooth with the texture of an omelette), the green chile was hard as well, the seeds hadn't been removed, and the cheese in the chile was chunked inside, not fully melted. Ick. Never again. I stopped going there.\n\nThis week I found myself in the Mission trying to grab a late night burrito with my honey only to discover that one of my favorite places, El Toro, on the corner of Valencia and 17th (yes, I know it's owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa but it is WORLDS better) is under construction and closed! The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty. The guacamole tasted like someone had literally dumped a whole shaker of salt in there. The saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even finish my burrito half. Past that, the carne asada was so completely bland and tasteless. \n\nIn their defense the service is great, fast, the place is clean and they do have a decent little salsa bar, they still fry their own chips (unlike other taquerias in the Mission), the Horchata is okay, and the musicos playing mariachi is always nice, too.  If only it were as good as it looks. Sigh.

You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal.

The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias.

The pico de gallo was super fresh and the black beans and rice had nice flavor, and the portions were perfect. I wouldn't change anything about the food.\n\nThe layout was weird because the salsas are in the very back, so it gets jammed up easily. I also don't get why you have to tell one lady, who is standing at a computer/register, your order and then get a receipt to pay at the next register. I guess it's so you can get your drinks and chips there, but it's weird and didn't flow well from what I saw. It's not a huge deal though and the food more than makes up for it.

Among the closest to my work happen to be Pancho Villa and Los Coyotes. In all honesty, I try and avoid both because I've been disappointed the few times I've visited either taqueria. Nevertheless I'm always open to try them every once in a while to see if they've improved. My most recent visit was this past Monday during the lunch rush.\n\nI was surprised at just how busy Pancho Villa was, but given the assembly line infrastructure in place, you can expect the wait to be minimal. I do wish they would have paper menus near the entrance because the menu board is obstructed from the door giving you little time to decide on your order once its your turn. \n\nI typically always go with tacos but this week I decided on trying their torta. The Mexican sandwich consists of your choice of protein along with cheese, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I added a side order of rice and beans at $1.50 each for a half pint. The total came out to $9 and some change after taxes with no soft drink.\n\n10 minutes later my order number was up and I was handed my order and filled up at their salsa bar. Once back at my desk, I unwrapped the torta and it looked a little sad and beat up. Although it wasn't the most visually appealing torta, it still had a chance. After a few bites, my conclusion was that it was okay but not great. The bread was toasted nicely and had plenty of melted cheese and the pollo asado was surprisingly great. The lettuce and tomato didn't do much, but luckily I had plenty of salsas to try and add flavor.\n\nThe pinto beans and rice were fine and completed the meal.

Back to the food though. The pricing here is super friendly to your wallet and it helps that the food is super delicious too. We were here for dinner on a Friday night and the place was very busy. Initially we had tried to order delivery through Eat24 and Grubhub, but both of these apps were not allowing us to order from here. We think that Pancho Villa ceases app orders during peak dining hours since they are already too occupied with the crowds. They were sporadically taking direct phone orders, so it can be hit or miss for that. I am glad we came in to dine here though because the smells in the air of the restaurant make the food taste even better. I shared the chicken fajita dinner plate, then we also ordered the vegetarian nachos, and carne asada dinner plate, as well as an XL fresa juice (strawberry juice). I did not try the juice, but heard that it was delicious. Getting the food to the table is a bit tricky since the place is so noisy and the ladies working here don't have loud enough voices to shout the order number over the roar of the diners. Even though there are 15 people working the shift, it is wise to stand near the end of the ordering line and wait for the food. It took about 15 minutes for them to get it ready, and we definitely got skipped over in line by the easier orders. It was all worth it in the end. They did give chips while we waited and the salsa bar they have is pretty legitimate. The green salsa had a kick to it, so be careful if you aren't one for spicy food. The meal itself was very tasty!

The bar is quite impressive, but I wish there were signs noting what the different salsas were and their heat level. The agua fresca was good too, but I prefer mine more tart.\n\nWhen my burrito came, it was a tight little foil tube; not much bigger than a paper towel tube. I was very excited to sink my teeth into a tasty burrito, but that excitement was extinguished very quickly when I realized how bland my burrito was. The taste of rice and jalapenos was so overwhelming that it's all I could taste. I muscled through most of the burrito, eventually throwing in the towel because it was boring and I was full.

Good sized chunks of steak were plentiful and there was a good mix of ingredients in each bite. \n\nA small portion of chips is complimentary with your burrito, perfect to sample the award-winning selections on the large salsa bar.\n\nPancho Villa Taqueria also offers a myriad of drink choices, including sodas ($1.00), Mexicoke ($2.50), and Aguas frescas ($2.00, $2.50, $3.00, and $3.50) as well as domestic ($3.50) and Mexican ($4.00) beers. \n\nThe line can sometimes be long, but it moves quickly.

Parking around the area sucks so take BART if you plan on going. Pancho Villa is always rather clean and the prices are reasonable. They serve over-sized plates and one dinner plate can easily satisfy two people. I'd recommend the steak and shrimp dinner plate. Their homemade  watermelon and cantaloupe drink are always on point and their salsa's are always in stock. They serve fresh tortillas with every plate along with fresh rice and beans so you can easily make your own tacos with your plate since it's big enough. \n\nCan't really say anything negative about Pancho Villa and that is always a good thing!", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-08-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The plate comes filled with sizzling garlic shrimp, chicken and beef with plenty of veggies black beans and rice- "], "author": "Sarah M.", "review": "Walking through the mission...walk...walk...walk.

It used to be the standard \"order from the girl who's making you the food\", and thus it was easy to specifiy \"I want this much rice, beans, salsa etc\" as she made it. Now it's \"order from the order-taker who has to enter your order into the computer which prints out the order for the girls to prepare\" and it's NEVER right.\n\nI've eaten there at least 2 dozen times since they've instituted this new system and literally, EVERY single time there is something WRONG with my order, something that never happened before when I interacted with the girl actually preparing my food.\n\nSmall example of how the new system sucks: occasionally I like prawn burritos. Previously, when I ordered one, the girl would tell the cook to start the prawns, and he would, and in the meantime she'd prepare the burrito. She'd always be done before him, so my burrito would be filled with hot and perfectly cooked prawns. Under the new system, I order the same burrito, but it gets queued. The order goes to the cook who starts the prawns, but the girls don't start preparing the burrito until AFTER the prawns are done, but they still sit there on the grille while they prepare the other ingredients. This means the prawns cook for an additional few minutes, and prawns cook so quickly that I now get hard rubbery prawns.\n\nAnother example: I like to go light on the rice and beans so as not to load up on carbs. In person, it's easy to say \"a bit less please\" but it's difficult to convey \"light rice/beans\" to the order taker, because although the computer system might allow it, each girl has their own idea of what \"light\" means, and thus my order ranges from way too much to slightly too much.

The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention.

There I would find Pancho Villa. And so I did, and I was happy...for a while. The demise of their quality began about 4 years ago when I bit into a chile relleno burrito I'd ordered there and it was DISGUSTING! The egg batter-fried shell the chile relleno had was hard, crunchy and too greasy (it's supposed to be supple and smooth with the texture of an omelette), the green chile was hard as well, the seeds hadn't been removed, and the cheese in the chile was chunked inside, not fully melted. Ick. Never again. I stopped going there.\n\nThis week I found myself in the Mission trying to grab a late night burrito with my honey only to discover that one of my favorite places, El Toro, on the corner of Valencia and 17th (yes, I know it's owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa but it is WORLDS better) is under construction and closed! The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty. The guacamole tasted like someone had literally dumped a whole shaker of salt in there. The saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even finish my burrito half.

When they ask if you want \"mild or hot\" salsa, choose option (c) Molcajete [roasted tomato & chile] or (d) chile verde [tomatillo & avocado].

The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias.

What is authenticity anyway?)\n\nHe pour a healthy dose of green salsa onto his Chicken Quesadilla as he answers.\n\n\"The most superficial, yet undoubtedly reliable indicator of authenticity is the lack of hipsters working in this establishment.\"\n\nI look over to the counter and realize at once that there are no hipsters to be found. Not one fedora. Holden smirks and continues.\n\n\"Authenticity cannot really be replicated, right? Or else it wouldn't be authentic. And I'm sure you've had better Mexican food than that delicious Al Pastor burrito you're holding because the Chef probably went on a Mexico pilgrimage to find out all there is to know about Tacos. I mean he knows exactly the right temperature to cook the meat and the exact amount of toppings to bring out the most flavor. Golly, he knows more about tacos than a majority of Mexicans probably.\"\n\nHe bites into the Quesadilla and lets the string of melted cheese linger from the tip of his mouth as he goes on.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, authenticity to a Mexican person is what grandma makes. Forget all the taco bullet points on the Chef's Macbook Pro because authenticity is whatever grandma decides that day. She might not even know half the stuff the Chef knows. And to me, anyone trying that hard to replicate something is well, kinda phony.\"\n\nAnd there it is, Holden's favorite word. Phony. I can't help but smile.\n\n(Okay Holden, but what's wrong with phony? This authentic burrito from Pancho Villa is unbelievably juicy and amazingly delicious, and so is that \"phony\" pork belly taco I had a couple of weeks ago. What is the problem?)\n\n\"The problem is that phony pork belly taco costs $10 a pop. Look, I am all about borrowing from other cultures and transforming it into something new, and maybe even something better. It's what makes America great.\"\n\nHolden pauses and opens up his receipt to show me his whole Quesadilla only costs $10. He resumes.\n \n\"But people have to realize that the community they are borrowing from do not have a strong presence in the 6-figure Silicon Valley circle. And if you have an ethnic restaurant with prices that are generally economically unrealistic for that particular ethnic group, then what the hell is that? It certainly IS NOT embracing that culture.\" \n\n(It sounds like we are getting into the topic of gentrification. The Mission was a rough place to be at 10 years ago. It is now a thriving and bustling neighborhood, and I'm sure even Pancho Villa is benefiting. Can't we give the hipster some credit?)\n\nHolden shrugs as if forced to agree.\n\n\"Yes, they deserve a lot of credit. And yes, I do love the Rebel Within and I may very well be addicted to Earl Grey ice cream and all, but for Chrissake they're driving out the community that makes the Mission the Mission!\"\n\n(But the increased rent prices is just Supply and Demand.)\n\n\"And I love it when economics come into play. I got axed from more prep schools than you'd like to know but I still remember what Externalities are. The people who are using Supply and Demand to justify evictions are neglecting costs that may not be measured right away. I mean, how the hell can you measure the cost of stripping an entire neighborhood of its essence? How would you measure your sadness if Pancho Villa's deliciousness got gentrified away?\"\n\nHe pauses, letting his argument linger with me like the taste of the fresh guacamole in my burrito. \n\n\"I think it's great that the hipsters are economically revitalizing the Mission and all. But instead of just living IN the community, it'll be great to see them live WITH them community.\"\n\n(And what do you propose they should do to accomplish this?)\n\n\"I don't know. But if these guys can figure out how to preserve all my net activities to data-mine me, they can figure out a way to preserve the culture in their neighborhood.\"\n\nWe laugh in agreement.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-01"}, {"excerpts": ["guacamole was watery (strange).

For this review, we will concentrate on the gold standard of measuring taquerias, the carne asada burrito. \n\nOf all the top Mission burrito joints, Pancho Villa Taqueria offers the most burrito customization options by far. Diners have choices of meat (carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, al pastor, spicy pollo, pollo chile verde, pork chile verde, tofu ranchero, lengua, steak fajitas, and pollo fajitas), beans (refried pinto, whole pinto, black whole, and black refried), tortilla (flour, whole wheat, red chile, and spinach), and salsa (mild or hot pico, molcajete stone ground, fire roasted arbol chile, and pastor roasted). \n\nA regular burrito ($7.00) sports your choice of meat, rice, beans, and salsa. The deluxe ($7.50) adds cheese. The especial ($8.00) will get you guacamole. The super ($9.00) scores you sour cream, lettuce, and tomato. \n\nWith a steamed tortilla, the carne asada burrito was sizable, but not overwhelming. Ordered spicy, it was quite piquant, but slightly dry, needing some salsa to give it the right consistency. Good sized chunks of steak were plentiful and there was a good mix of ingredients in each bite. \n\nA small portion of chips is complimentary with your burrito, perfect to sample the award-winning selections on the large salsa bar.\n\nPancho Villa Taqueria also offers a myriad of drink choices, including sodas ($1.00), Mexicoke ($2.50), and Aguas frescas ($2.00, $2.50, $3.00, and $3.50) as well as domestic ($3.50) and Mexican ($4.00) beers. \n\nThe line can sometimes be long, but it moves quickly.

The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing. Salmon, soon to be in someone's seafood burrito, is grilled before my eyes. I usually like to go through the meats first and then expand whence my proposed essentials are covered.\n\nChar-broiled steak, black refried beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, lettuce and bits of radish are piled high on a small doubly layered tortilla foundation to make my carne asada super taco ($4). I was left in a brief state of wonder. How to approach eating this masterpiece with ingredient proportionate mouthfuls and limited spillage? I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers. He also holds a slightly beat up pink teddy bear with an early Valentine's Day premise to be sure. The mother of the family sitting next to us bought her self a rose. Her husband looked on while a broad smile spread across her face. \n\nNow lets talk about what put a smile on my face. I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention. The Aguas Frescas are served in Greenware cups. Upon finishing a meal, the most prominent options are to recycle and compost leftovers. I revel in the taqueria's proactive eco attitude, unlike such unnamed businesses who \"urge\" one to recycle but do not even supply a recycling bin on premises.\n\nPerched on the back wall, a statue of Pancho Villa happily surveys the crowd with gun in hand.

There I would find Pancho Villa. And so I did, and I was happy...for a while. The demise of their quality began about 4 years ago when I bit into a chile relleno burrito I'd ordered there and it was DISGUSTING! The egg batter-fried shell the chile relleno had was hard, crunchy and too greasy (it's supposed to be supple and smooth with the texture of an omelette), the green chile was hard as well, the seeds hadn't been removed, and the cheese in the chile was chunked inside, not fully melted. Ick. Never again. I stopped going there.\n\nThis week I found myself in the Mission trying to grab a late night burrito with my honey only to discover that one of my favorite places, El Toro, on the corner of Valencia and 17th (yes, I know it's owned by the same people who own Pancho Villa but it is WORLDS better) is under construction and closed! The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty. The guacamole tasted like someone had literally dumped a whole shaker of salt in there. The saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even finish my burrito half. Past that, the carne asada was so completely bland and tasteless. \n\nIn their defense the service is great, fast, the place is clean and they do have a decent little salsa bar, they still fry their own chips (unlike other taquerias in the Mission), the Horchata is okay, and the musicos playing mariachi is always nice, too.

For this review, we will concentrate on the gold standard of measuring taquerias, the carne asada burrito. \n\nOf all the top Mission burrito joints, Pancho Villa Taqueria offers the most burrito customization options by far. Diners have choices of meat (carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, al pastor, spicy pollo, pollo chile verde, pork chile verde, tofu ranchero, lengua, steak fajitas, and pollo fajitas), beans (refried pinto, whole pinto, black whole, and black refried), tortilla (flour, whole wheat, red chile, and spinach), and salsa (mild or hot pico, molcajete stone ground, fire roasted arbol chile, and pastor roasted). \n\nA regular burrito ($7.00) sports your choice of meat, rice, beans, and salsa. The deluxe ($7.50) adds cheese. The especial ($8.00) will get you guacamole. The super ($9.00) scores you sour cream, lettuce, and tomato. \n\nWith a steamed tortilla, the carne asada burrito was sizable, but not overwhelming. Ordered spicy, it was quite piquant, but slightly dry, needing some salsa to give it the right consistency. Good sized chunks of steak were plentiful and there was a good mix of ingredients in each bite. \n\nA small portion of chips is complimentary with your burrito, perfect to sample the award-winning selections on the large salsa bar.\n\nPancho Villa Taqueria also offers a myriad of drink choices, including sodas ($1.00), Mexicoke ($2.50), and Aguas frescas ($2.00, $2.50, $3.00, and $3.50) as well as domestic ($3.50) and Mexican ($4.00) beers. \n\nThe line can sometimes be long, but it moves quickly. Service is fast, efficient, and polite. \n\nWhile not in the same league as El Farolito, La Taqueria, or Taqueria Cancun, Pancho Villa Taqueria puts out some seriously good burritos.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Sour cream looked weird,but tasted okay "], "author": "Isabella A.", "review": "This is my review of my order from September 5th,2015.\n\nI never had Mexican delivered before so I decided to try this place out based on the reviews.\n\nI ordered:\n\n3 Can Soda  $ 3.00  \n1 Jarrito  $ 2.35  \n1 Nachos  $ 5.45  \n1 Flan  $ 3.75  \n1 Alfajor  $ 1.50  \n1 Deluxe Burrito  $ 8.00  \n\nOkay first off the delivery  man was very nice.

You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias. I also love the salsa bar, with around 10 options of salsa to pick from. They seem to have won a ton of awards on their salsa. La Taq doesn't give you salsas with your food, and it even sucks more when you get takeout there because there are no to-go containers for salsa.\n\nAnd lastly, seating is fairly abundant so you don't have to fight for tables.

Borrowing from each other's experience and artistry, they created the resounding culture that is the Mission District today.\n\nThe murals are still around, and so are remnants of the sound and music that defined the Mission. But you look around and see that they are sandwiched by $4 lattes, Kale smoothies, and gluten-free breakfast. Holy smokes! Has the Mission gentrified into a new playground for those sweater-wearing, software-programming hipsters?!?\n\nToday I'm sitting down with Holden Caulfield at Pancho Villa Tacqueria. You may remember Holden from your high school literature class as a judgmental teenager upset with the world. Well, he hasn't changed much. Holden handpicked Pancho Villa for our meeting place because he claims it is part of a group of diminishing authentic eateries in the Mission. The appetizing smell of meat that hangs over the air convinces me that this is a good choice regardless.\n\n(So Holden, what makes Pancho Villa authentic? What is authenticity anyway?)\n\nHe pour a healthy dose of green salsa onto his Chicken Quesadilla as he answers.\n\n\"The most superficial, yet undoubtedly reliable indicator of authenticity is the lack of hipsters working in this establishment.\"\n\nI look over to the counter and realize at once that there are no hipsters to be found. Not one fedora. Holden smirks and continues.\n\n\"Authenticity cannot really be replicated, right? Or else it wouldn't be authentic. And I'm sure you've had better Mexican food than that delicious Al Pastor burrito you're holding because the Chef probably went on a Mexico pilgrimage to find out all there is to know about Tacos. I mean he knows exactly the right temperature to cook the meat and the exact amount of toppings to bring out the most flavor. Golly, he knows more about tacos than a majority of Mexicans probably.\"\n\nHe bites into the Quesadilla and lets the string of melted cheese linger from the tip of his mouth as he goes on.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, authenticity to a Mexican person is what grandma makes. Forget all the taco bullet points on the Chef's Macbook Pro because authenticity is whatever grandma decides that day. She might not even know half the stuff the Chef knows. And to me, anyone trying that hard to replicate something is well, kinda phony.\"\n\nAnd there it is, Holden's favorite word. Phony. I can't help but smile.\n\n(Okay Holden, but what's wrong with phony? This authentic burrito from Pancho Villa is unbelievably juicy and amazingly delicious, and so is that \"phony\" pork belly taco I had a couple of weeks ago. What is the problem?)\n\n\"The problem is that phony pork belly taco costs $10 a pop. Look, I am all about borrowing from other cultures and transforming it into something new, and maybe even something better. It's what makes America great.\"\n\nHolden pauses and opens up his receipt to show me his whole Quesadilla only costs $10. He resumes.\n \n\"But people have to realize that the community they are borrowing from do not have a strong presence in the 6-figure Silicon Valley circle. And if you have an ethnic restaurant with prices that are generally economically unrealistic for that particular ethnic group, then what the hell is that? It certainly IS NOT embracing that culture.\" \n\n(It sounds like we are getting into the topic of gentrification. The Mission was a rough place to be at 10 years ago. It is now a thriving and bustling neighborhood, and I'm sure even Pancho Villa is benefiting. Can't we give the hipster some credit?)\n\nHolden shrugs as if forced to agree.\n\n\"Yes, they deserve a lot of credit. And yes, I do love the Rebel Within and I may very well be addicted to Earl Grey ice cream and all, but for Chrissake they're driving out the community that makes the Mission the Mission!\"\n\n(But the increased rent prices is just Supply and Demand.)\n\n\"And I love it when economics come into play. I got axed from more prep schools than you'd like to know but I still remember what Externalities are. The people who are using Supply and Demand to justify evictions are neglecting costs that may not be measured right away. I mean, how the hell can you measure the cost of stripping an entire neighborhood of its essence? How would you measure your sadness if Pancho Villa's deliciousness got gentrified away?\"\n\nHe pauses, letting his argument linger with me like the taste of the fresh guacamole in my burrito. \n\n\"I think it's great that the hipsters are economically revitalizing the Mission and all. But instead of just living IN the community, it'll be great to see them live WITH them community.\"\n\n(And what do you propose they should do to accomplish this?)\n\n\"I don't know. But if these guys can figure out how to preserve all my net activities to data-mine me, they can figure out a way to preserve the culture in their neighborhood.\"\n\nWe laugh in agreement.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-06-01"}, {"excerpts": ["The tacos were really fantastic, even though they were made of just meat, beans, and salsa.

Among the closest to my work happen to be Pancho Villa and Los Coyotes. In all honesty, I try and avoid both because I've been disappointed the few times I've visited either taqueria. Nevertheless I'm always open to try them every once in a while to see if they've improved. My most recent visit was this past Monday during the lunch rush.\n\nI was surprised at just how busy Pancho Villa was, but given the assembly line infrastructure in place, you can expect the wait to be minimal. I do wish they would have paper menus near the entrance because the menu board is obstructed from the door giving you little time to decide on your order once its your turn. \n\nI typically always go with tacos but this week I decided on trying their torta. The Mexican sandwich consists of your choice of protein along with cheese, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I added a side order of rice and beans at $1.50 each for a half pint. The total came out to $9 and some change after taxes with no soft drink.\n\n10 minutes later my order number was up and I was handed my order and filled up at their salsa bar. Once back at my desk, I unwrapped the torta and it looked a little sad and beat up. Although it wasn't the most visually appealing torta, it still had a chance. After a few bites, my conclusion was that it was okay but not great. The bread was toasted nicely and had plenty of melted cheese and the pollo asado was surprisingly great.

Yes, I've been to La Taqueria many times and know they were voted best burrito in America, but I think Pancho Villa wins on several fronts: price, meat, moistness of burrito, salsa, and they take credit cards.

You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias.

It was so bad she went back and returned her burrito for her money back.\n\nIn general all the items and weird proportions of ingredients, mostly veggies and beans.\n\nThis is not to say this place is disgusting or it didn't use to be good.

For this review, we will concentrate on the gold standard of measuring taquerias, the carne asada burrito. \n\nOf all the top Mission burrito joints, Pancho Villa Taqueria offers the most burrito customization options by far. Diners have choices of meat (carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, al pastor, spicy pollo, pollo chile verde, pork chile verde, tofu ranchero, lengua, steak fajitas, and pollo fajitas), beans (refried pinto, whole pinto, black whole, and black refried), tortilla (flour, whole wheat, red chile, and spinach), and salsa (mild or hot pico, molcajete stone ground, fire roasted arbol chile, and pastor roasted). \n\nA regular burrito ($7.00) sports your choice of meat, rice, beans, and salsa. The deluxe ($7.50) adds cheese. The especial ($8.00) will get you guacamole. The super ($9.00) scores you sour cream, lettuce, and tomato. \n\nWith a steamed tortilla, the carne asada burrito was sizable, but not overwhelming. Ordered spicy, it was quite piquant, but slightly dry, needing some salsa to give it the right consistency. Good sized chunks of steak were plentiful and there was a good mix of ingredients in each bite. \n\nA small portion of chips is complimentary with your burrito, perfect to sample the award-winning selections on the large salsa bar.\n\nPancho Villa Taqueria also offers a myriad of drink choices, including sodas ($1.00), Mexicoke ($2.50), and Aguas frescas ($2.00, $2.50, $3.00, and $3.50) as well as domestic ($3.50) and Mexican ($4.00) beers. \n\nThe line can sometimes be long, but it moves quickly.

The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing.

When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers.

I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention. The Aguas Frescas are served in Greenware cups. Upon finishing a meal, the most prominent options are to recycle and compost leftovers. I revel in the taqueria's proactive eco attitude, unlike such unnamed businesses who \"urge\" one to recycle but do not even supply a recycling bin on premises.\n\nPerched on the back wall, a statue of Pancho Villa happily surveys the crowd with gun in hand.

Nevertheless I'm always open to try them every once in a while to see if they've improved. My most recent visit was this past Monday during the lunch rush.\n\nI was surprised at just how busy Pancho Villa was, but given the assembly line infrastructure in place, you can expect the wait to be minimal. I do wish they would have paper menus near the entrance because the menu board is obstructed from the door giving you little time to decide on your order once its your turn. \n\nI typically always go with tacos but this week I decided on trying their torta. The Mexican sandwich consists of your choice of protein along with cheese, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I added a side order of rice and beans at $1.50 each for a half pint. The total came out to $9 and some change after taxes with no soft drink.\n\n10 minutes later my order number was up and I was handed my order and filled up at their salsa bar. Once back at my desk, I unwrapped the torta and it looked a little sad and beat up. Although it wasn't the most visually appealing torta, it still had a chance. After a few bites, my conclusion was that it was okay but not great. The bread was toasted nicely and had plenty of melted cheese and the pollo asado was surprisingly great. The lettuce and tomato didn't do much, but luckily I had plenty of salsas to try and add flavor.\n\nThe pinto beans and rice were fine and completed the meal.

The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing. Salmon, soon to be in someone's seafood burrito, is grilled before my eyes. I usually like to go through the meats first and then expand whence my proposed essentials are covered.\n\nChar-broiled steak, black refried beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, lettuce and bits of radish are piled high on a small doubly layered tortilla foundation to make my carne asada super taco ($4). I was left in a brief state of wonder. How to approach eating this masterpiece with ingredient proportionate mouthfuls and limited spillage? I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers. He also holds a slightly beat up pink teddy bear with an early Valentine's Day premise to be sure. The mother of the family sitting next to us bought her self a rose. Her husband looked on while a broad smile spread across her face. \n\nNow lets talk about what put a smile on my face. I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention. The Aguas Frescas are served in Greenware cups. Upon finishing a meal, the most prominent options are to recycle and compost leftovers. I revel in the taqueria's proactive eco attitude, unlike such unnamed businesses who \"urge\" one to recycle but do not even supply a recycling bin on premises.\n\nPerched on the back wall, a statue of Pancho Villa happily surveys the crowd with gun in hand.

They're way better than the out-of-season pico de gallo-type \"mild\" and \"hot\" salsas.\n3. All the beans are good. Whether you go for whole (black or pinto) or refried (also black or pinto) is a matter of how moist you want your burrito on a given night.\n4.

Of course there was a line, but this gave me a chance to study the extensive colorful menu posted above the food preparation area.  The prices have inched up over the years so take note they are more expensive than other taquerias in the Mission.  The menu is huge and there are so many choices, everything from all meat burritos to tequila prawns.  Also, there are a lot of vegetarian options.\n\nPrawn Fajitas\nI decided on the prawn fajitas.  The prawns (the exoskeleton was missing so I couldn't tell if they were shrimp or prawns) were cooked on the grill with mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions.  Spanish rice, whole beans, corn tortillas, and sliced avocados rounded out the dish.  I stopped by the salsa bar before I sat down.  This is a serious salsa bar!  I counted over six homemade salsas, roasted jalapenos, pickled jalapenos, chopped onions, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges.  I tried three of the salsas and they were fantastic.\n\nI could not finish all of my entr\u00e9e so I asked for a to-go container.

The real deal is two small tortillas, slightly oily from being heated on the grill with oil, your meat of choice topped with diced onions and chopped cilantro with a dash of salsa.\n\nWhile I've been here before, I've usually been so drunk that I didn't really have my connoisseur hat on...i just wanted food in my belly like NOW ;-) So, last nite was different, although I was a bit buzzed from riding my bike for 2hrs and then eating only a few chips with 3 beers ;-) \n\nAny who, the first thing that struck me was that the tacos were $2.25, in my old hood, Redwood City,  the tacos were $1.19 and prepared as I described above. What I got at PV was two small steamed tortillas(ya need the oil man!) and a mountain of meat with some pico de gallo salsa on top. Well with the amount of meat they piled on there I would've just had two tacos. I understand that American like a lot of food, thus the obesity rates being on the rise, but I think they should make the tacos the traditional way and if some overweight Americano wants more food, then he can order more tacos. OK, OK, enough soapboxing. Sorry. But this is the food of my peeps and I don't like to see it bastardized.\n\nSo I order 4 tacos: al pastor, lengua, pollo asado, chile verde. The Chicken and al pastor were too dried out, but OMFG the lengua and chile Verde were off the hook! The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. I even got my non-Mexican friend to try lengua tacos and he loved'em!\n\nI do have to give PV major kudos for their salsas...good selection, tasty and spicy! Another nice touch is the fresh radishes, lemons, grilled jalapenos and chilies del arbol. Now that's authentic Mexican.\n\nI also like the fact that their import beers are only $2.75...that's cheaper than the bars.\n\nLast thing I dig about the place is that they always have local artists works up on the wall. The food is good-great, but the traditional-ness is a bit in question, but since the lengua and chile verde tacos wooed me, PV still gets 4.5 stars!

I had a Quesadilla Suiza with Spicy Chicken.  I asked them to make it spicy, and I guess that meant one or two jalapenos stuffed inside - I was complaining to my dining companion that it wasn't spicy like I'd asked when I got a mouthful of fire.\n\nThe salsa bar is certainly a plus, but it would be helpful if there was some signage telling you what the hell everything is.  Maybe there was and I just didn't see it, so dazed was I by the bright lights and diverse crowd.  But I had no idea what I was sampling.\n\nAlso, the quesadilla ended up swimming in its own \"juices,\" for lack of a better word.  When I had half of it the next day, reheated, it was much better because it wasn't all soggy, and the heat from the cooking didn't take away from the flavors.  So my advice would be to get it takeout.\n\nTo sum: takeout, if you like spicy use salsas instead of asking them to do it, and get a veggie burrito, cause my friend swears they're god's gift to man.

Pancho Villa Taqueria is Exhibit 553 in support of this contention.  Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I have previously bitched and moaned about, I've been working hellacious hours lately.  Basically, 10-12 hours days, at least 6 days a week, for two months straight.  But, whatever, it's not like I have a lot of other things going on in my life, so work is a fine way to pass the time.  But, there's a limit on exactly how much of myself I can carve up and give away without repercussions.  On Monday, I woke up, didn't feel all that awesome.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 11 hours.  Little Afrin kept the pipes clean.  Tuesday, woke up, felt kinda bad.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 12 hours.  Little more Afrin kept the pipes sorta clean.  Sneezed on and off all day.  Wednesday, woke up, felt totally like crap.  Really didn't matter, absolutely had to work.  For 11 hours.  Afrin didn't do a damn thing.  Sneezed constantly, used up half a box of Kleenex.  Thursday, woke up, felt like I'd been beaten with a baseball bat.  Didn't matter, had to work.  At 11:00, I turned away from the document I was reading for 2 minutes to read an email, turned back, and couldn't find the place on the page where I stopped reading.  Because none of it was familiar.  Okay, no biggie, started reading from the top.  Halfway through, turned away for another minute to answer another email, turned back, couldn't find my place again.  Realized that my continued presence at work could constitute malpractice, went home.  Where I still worked for another 3 hours, but mostly from the prone position.  Friday, woke up, felt like a bag of smashed assholes, looked even worse than usual (if you can believe it), stayed home.  Took 2 DayQuil and a variety of other stuff.  Worked maybe 4 hours.  Seriously contemplated flushing Blackberry down the toilet so people would stop calling me.\n\nBy supper, I was actually feeling pretty decent.  Not all the way healthy, but better than I had for days.  And my sister-in-law and her fiance were visiting.  So, after a dinner of leftover Chinese food at our place (not my choice, long story), we head out to meet two of sis-in-laws friends.  They also live close to the Mission, so we pick a nearby place I like.  And by place, I mean bar.  And I'm feeling pretty decent, so I drink:\n\n1 mint julep;\n1 Crown & Coke;\n1 12 oz. Watermelon Wheat Beer with a whiskey chaser; and\n1.5 liters of some German beer beloved by the guy in the group from Munich.\n\nNow, just so we're all on the same page, those bottles of Pepsi that sit in your refrigerator door, those are 2 liters.  So I basically drank 75% of one of those, in beer.  Now, at this point, between the massive quantities of pharmaceuticals that are coursing through my veins, and the alcohol, I'm easily not in my right mind.  But I'm not an idiot, and I know that the half-serving of Kang Shao shredded beef I ate 5 hours ago is absolutely not up to the task of fighting off this quantity of alcohol.  Reinforcements are needed.\n\nEnter Pancho Villa Taqueria.  It's basically between the bar and my place, so it's the natural choice.  I split an enchilada dinner with my soon-to-be brother-in-law, wifey and sis split some nachos, and friend and German guy split a burrito.  I also have a watermelon agua fresca, because I think it'll go great with the watermelon wheat beer I had an hour ago.  Plus, I smother the enchiladas with hot sauce and a healthy helping of extra jalapeno slices, because how would that ever come back to haunt me?\n\nFast forward to 5:15 a.m.  I wake up to find that a small army of industrious dwarfs are building a mid-rise, mixed-use building inside my skull.  And it's a problem.  They're violating all sorts of building codes, they don't have the proper permits, and it's not even an approved use for that particular plot of my frontal lobes.  I sit up to have a word with them, and the bed turns 8 or 9 complete circles and dips up and down a few times like a log ride.  I burp 4 or 5 times in rapid succession, and its....watermelon and jalapenos?  Not 2 great tastes that taste great together.  I quickly lay back down and manage to organize a brief union picket that temporarily brings the dwarfs' construction project to a halt.

Pancho Villa Taqueria is Exhibit 553 in support of this contention.  Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I have previously bitched and moaned about, I've been working hellacious hours lately.  Basically, 10-12 hours days, at least 6 days a week, for two months straight.  But, whatever, it's not like I have a lot of other things going on in my life, so work is a fine way to pass the time.  But, there's a limit on exactly how much of myself I can carve up and give away without repercussions.  On Monday, I woke up, didn't feel all that awesome.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 11 hours.  Little Afrin kept the pipes clean.  Tuesday, woke up, felt kinda bad.  Doesn't matter, had to work.  For 12 hours.  Little more Afrin kept the pipes sorta clean.  Sneezed on and off all day.  Wednesday, woke up, felt totally like crap.  Really didn't matter, absolutely had to work.  For 11 hours.  Afrin didn't do a damn thing.  Sneezed constantly, used up half a box of Kleenex.  Thursday, woke up, felt like I'd been beaten with a baseball bat.  Didn't matter, had to work.  At 11:00, I turned away from the document I was reading for 2 minutes to read an email, turned back, and couldn't find the place on the page where I stopped reading.  Because none of it was familiar.  Okay, no biggie, started reading from the top.  Halfway through, turned away for another minute to answer another email, turned back, couldn't find my place again.  Realized that my continued presence at work could constitute malpractice, went home.  Where I still worked for another 3 hours, but mostly from the prone position.  Friday, woke up, felt like a bag of smashed assholes, looked even worse than usual (if you can believe it), stayed home.  Took 2 DayQuil and a variety of other stuff.  Worked maybe 4 hours.  Seriously contemplated flushing Blackberry down the toilet so people would stop calling me.\n\nBy supper, I was actually feeling pretty decent.  Not all the way healthy, but better than I had for days.  And my sister-in-law and her fiance were visiting.  So, after a dinner of leftover Chinese food at our place (not my choice, long story), we head out to meet two of sis-in-laws friends.

Watermelon Wheat Beer with a whiskey chaser; and\n1.5 liters of some German beer beloved by the guy in the group from Munich.\n\nNow, just so we're all on the same page, those bottles of Pepsi that sit in your refrigerator door, those are 2 liters.  So I basically drank 75% of one of those, in beer.  Now, at this point, between the massive quantities of pharmaceuticals that are coursing through my veins, and the alcohol, I'm easily not in my right mind.  But I'm not an idiot, and I know that the half-serving of Kang Shao shredded beef I ate 5 hours ago is absolutely not up to the task of fighting off this quantity of alcohol.  Reinforcements are needed.\n\nEnter Pancho Villa Taqueria.  It's basically between the bar and my place, so it's the natural choice.  I split an enchilada dinner with my soon-to-be brother-in-law, wifey and sis split some nachos, and friend and German guy split a burrito.  I also have a watermelon agua fresca, because I think it'll go great with the watermelon wheat beer I had an hour ago.  Plus, I smother the enchiladas with hot sauce and a healthy helping of extra jalapeno slices, because how would that ever come back to haunt me?\n\nFast forward to 5:15 a.m.  I wake up to find that a small army of industrious dwarfs are building a mid-rise, mixed-use building inside my skull.  And it's a problem.  They're violating all sorts of building codes, they don't have the proper permits, and it's not even an approved use for that particular plot of my frontal lobes.  I sit up to have a word with them, and the bed turns 8 or 9 complete circles and dips up and down a few times like a log ride.  I burp 4 or 5 times in rapid succession, and its....watermelon and jalapenos?  Not 2 great tastes that taste great together.  I quickly lay back down and manage to organize a brief union picket that temporarily brings the dwarfs' construction project to a halt.  I am faced with three choices, in descending order of what would actually be a good idea: 1. go to the bathroom and prematurely reintroduce my midnight Mexican meal and accompanying alcoholic pickling juice to the world; 2. go get a drink of water; 3. roll over and go back to sleep and pray things turn out okay.  I try 3, but can't get it to happen, so I compromise on 2.\n\nBottom line: I would probably be in worse shape, but for my trip to Pancho Villa.  That being said, it's now 12 hours later, and I can still taste my meal.  And not in a completely good way.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Not a fan yet... maybe I had the wrong meal (taco and enchilada)... ", "the Quesadilla looked yummy.

Because it was Father's Day and my brother-in-laws favorite meal is Mexican food, I was hoping he would have taken us to a taco truck. But no such luck.  Instead, the last 1-hour, for dinner, before heading to the airport, was spent at his favorite Mexican restaurant, Pancho Villa Taqueria.\n\nPancho's is in the Mission district.  Back in 2002, I had a somewhat of a frightening experience in the Mission.  So I was dreading going into that part of the city.  No matter how much gentrification and rehabilitation this part of town is going through, I the incident is so clear to me that it felt like it just happened a few hours ago.\n\nSunday, wasn't to bad in the city.  Although we had to park 3 short blocks away, we were able to find parking rather quickly.  And I wasn't too fearful walking to the restaurant because my husband was with me.  But he made damn sure that I wore my purse as a crossbody instead of my usual left shoulder.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant and this place is busy.  Most tables were full.  Many families were there enjoying dinner.  Plenty of people waiting for their orders to be completed.  So that means, we are at the tail end of the rush.  \n\nI chose the chicken flautas plate, while my brother-in-law got his usual three tacos with prawns, my husband and sister got the super burrito. So although my husband checked in on Yelp to use the $2 off deal on the super burrito, they didn't apply it.  A negative but not enough to ruin our family time together.  My brother-in-law asked my sister how much his tacos were. I can't remember how much it was, but they charged $1 more for the prawns for each of his tacos.  When we told him the price, he was shocked.  Later he says, during the weekdays, they have \"happy hour\" where those same tacos are cheaper.  \n\nWhat was free you ask? Chips and salsa bar.  The chips were made fresh and was really good.\n\nBecause I did not grow up on Mexican food, I thought it was good, not spectacular, but good.  My husband and sister could only finish half of their super burrito. And because we were flying home, we gave all of our leftovers to the sister, even if she kept trying to push it on me to take it home.\n\nAnd although I don't believe we did anything wrong, one of the cooks was mad dogging our table.  I chalk that up to being a cultural difference thing, but lucky my husband's back was facing towards them and of course I didn't tell him.  It would have been a bad situation and I didn't want to ruin a beautiful day.

I paid & was given a number. \n\nI was given some corn chips & found a seat luckily as it gets crazy busy here during the lunch hour. I went to the stellar salsa bar to get some salsa, hot peppers, radishes, & pickled carrots w/ jalape\u00f1o. I enjoyed my chips & salsa. After a short while my tofu ranchero burrito was delivered to my table. It was filling & flavorful. \n\nThe ambience here is hectic & busy which could be a plus or minus depending on what you are in the mood for. One room for improvement is on the salsa bar it would be great if the salsas were labeled mild, medium, or spicy etc as the aren't labeled.

"], "author": "Elizabeth M.", "review": "After a long day of exploring not only the Mission, but all of San Francisco with a friend, I was longing for a Mission burrito. Having already checked out El Farolito and La Taqueria on previous occasions, I decided to go where the person which I was with at the moment wanted to go to, and this happened to be Pancho Villa.\n\nAs soon as you walk in to Pancho Villa, the first smell that will hit you is that of their carne asada. This, along with the recommendation of the friend I was with, solidified that I would be ordering a carne asada burrito. The line can seem daunting at first, and it can be quite annoying when you are starving in line waiting with what seems to be hundreds of workers in the kitchen yet there you are, still in the same spot fifteen minutes later...\n\nDespite the mess that is their ordering system, I eventually got to the front of the line and ordered for my friend and I- it turned out to be $25 for two carne asada burritos, two horchatas, and tip. Pancho Villa definitely gets one star for free chips and their extensive self-serve salsa bar. Try the orange salsa, you will not be disappointed!\n\nAs my experience with Pancho Villa was mixed up to this point, all depended on the burrito. After only having had one meal all day, I was more than excited to unwrap this burrito and eat it.\n\nHowever, I ended up being largely disappointed when it came to actually eating the burrito. Coming from a small town in which there is an abundance of Mexican food, I was confused when I noticed that the rice in Pancho Villa's burritos includes peas and carrots, ya know those peas and carrots that come with frozen rice? Yeah, doesn't seem very appetizing, right? This caught me off guard and honestly ruined the burrito for me. Pancho Villa's- if the rice in your burrito is going to include peas and carrots, please note so somewhere, anywhere, this is not custom in literally any Mexican establishment that sells food.\n\nI sadly will not be returning due to this.

Had no idea this place was so popular, a group of seven of us came for a quick dinner before bowling on Friday and we were so lucky to miss the long line!\n\nFOOD- friend raved about the shrimp taco so of course I had to try it! The taco was nicely wrapped (to my surprise!) and filed with coleslaw, the few shrimps inside were crispy and bouncy, flavor was pretty good, but I was not wow'ed. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised by the fish taco. The large pieces of fish was cooked just right, moist, and delicious with some salsa added on top. I can imagine that both tacos would taste better if I got it 'super' with avocado etc. I liked the fact that your order comes with free chips and you go to retrieve whatever/however much salsa from the back counter. Other friends ordered burritos and shrimp super tacos, which they enjoyed.\n\nSPACE- large brightly-lit space with lots of seating. The small stools make for a casual atmosphere but good luck if you have a large jacket that you took off because it was so hot/stuffy inside and hope for more luck if you also have a purse to carry and did not want to place it on the not so clean floor. :( Bathroom was not that clean and appeared to have flooded all over. We later found out that it was 'just cleaned'. Maybe someone just decided to pour water over everything- the toilet, toilet seat, toilet tank, and floors to 'clean it'. I would avoid using the bathroom if possible.\n\nSERVICE/PRICE- friendly staff and the ordering process was quick and easy. Line may get long, but it moves pretty fast. They take your order, you pay, they they prepare your food per your receipt/order. Shrimp taco was $3.50 and fish taco was $3. They are of decent size, but not quite enough to fill me up.

Yes, I've been to La Taqueria many times and know they were voted best burrito in America, but I think Pancho Villa wins on several fronts: price, meat, moistness of burrito, salsa, and they take credit cards. All pluses in my book.\n\nFirst, the burritos are totally reasonably priced. You can even get a baby burrito for $5.50 which is smaller, and then burritos will run $7 to $8.50 depending on if it has guacamole, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. They even have occasional coupons on Yelp for $2 off a Super Burrito (normally $8.50), which is a great deal. The size of the burritos are enormous. I eat a lot and couldn't finish an entire Super burrito. The difference between the burritos here and La Taq are that they have rice inside (which is flavored and has a little bit of veggies inside), and a wider selection of beans black and pinto refried beans, and whole beans. The La Taq burrito has more meat and no rice but I find the meat to be blander and the burrito is also dry. I really like the chicken here as it's flavorful and grilled.\n\nThey also give you chips with your order which is always nice, vs. having to buy chips at other taquerias. I also love the salsa bar, with around 10 options of salsa to pick from. They seem to have won a ton of awards on their salsa. La Taq doesn't give you salsas with your food, and it even sucks more when you get takeout there because there are no to-go containers for salsa.\n\nAnd lastly, seating is fairly abundant so you don't have to fight for tables.

Nevertheless I'm always open to try them every once in a while to see if they've improved. My most recent visit was this past Monday during the lunch rush.\n\nI was surprised at just how busy Pancho Villa was, but given the assembly line infrastructure in place, you can expect the wait to be minimal.

There is a security guard at the entrance, which sets the precedent for the type of area you are in. This guard was actually really nice and did his job superbly, escorting a vagabond heckler out of the restaurant without causing a scene and also helping the staff out by cleaning the tables here and there. Back to the food though. The pricing here is super friendly to your wallet and it helps that the food is super delicious too. We were here for dinner on a Friday night and the place was very busy. Initially we had tried to order delivery through Eat24 and Grubhub, but both of these apps were not allowing us to order from here. We think that Pancho Villa ceases app orders during peak dining hours since they are already too occupied with the crowds. They were sporadically taking direct phone orders, so it can be hit or miss for that. I am glad we came in to dine here though because the smells in the air of the restaurant make the food taste even better. I shared the chicken fajita dinner plate, then we also ordered the vegetarian nachos, and carne asada dinner plate, as well as an XL fresa juice (strawberry juice). I did not try the juice, but heard that it was delicious. Getting the food to the table is a bit tricky since the place is so noisy and the ladies working here don't have loud enough voices to shout the order number over the roar of the diners. Even though there are 15 people working the shift, it is wise to stand near the end of the ordering line and wait for the food. It took about 15 minutes for them to get it ready, and we definitely got skipped over in line by the easier orders. It was all worth it in the end. They did give chips while we waited and the salsa bar they have is pretty legitimate. The green salsa had a kick to it, so be careful if you aren't one for spicy food. The meal itself was very tasty! I really liked the chicken because it was the right texture and seasoning. The Mexican rice was also very tasty and I ended up eating it all. Other stuff that came on the dinner plate was beans and a small salad. All of this ended up being plenty of food for two people.

Add the horchata, and lunch was  hair over $10 for me.\n\nServers bring the food to you, and my first impression upon seeing my burrito was that it looked too, well, neat.  It was like a perfect tubular shape, and looked perfectly parallel.  And it wasn't as large as I thought it was going to be; my first burrito in the Bay was from La Tapatia in SSF, and it was a big messy delicious monster.  Pancho Villa's burrito, wrapped in its wrinkle-free foil almost looked like a slice of a pipe.\n\nRegardless, burritos are burritos, and I tore into it and began eating.  The flavors were definitely good, and you could tell the ingredients were fairly fresh.  I killed the rest of the burrito in less time than I thought it would take; whether I was just hungry, or it wasn't as large as I thought it would be is really unmemorable.

Perhaps I'd fare better during happy hour =P\n\nThe nachos were also pretty good, but what was even better was that we had a bunch of left over nacho fixings left on our plate, as most nachos have a low chip to topping ratio.  But the employees at Pancho Villa Taqueria were happy to give us more, and more chips.  I don't see why people are complaining about the little amounts of chips that you get, just ask for more!\n\nAnd as everyone else said, the salsa bar is pretty good.  Don't know how to describe it, but the salsas are thicker and has more substance than what you usually see in salsa bars.  The fact that you pretty much have an endless amount of good salsa and chips is just awesome :)\n\nOne more note, my roommate from San Diego who is super super picky about his Mexican food gave the thumbs up for this place, that means alot!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-06-27"}, {"excerpts": ["and you just want chips."], "author": "Rohan D.", "review": "Let's ignore the long lines here because any good burrito place is going to have a long line near the BART station and near bars. \n\nI decided to go with the quesadilla with the spicy salsa.

Everyone knows where it is and goes there now and again, but I am pretty positive most folks don't live in the Mission that go there. Ok, Mission local snobbery apparently has not left me.

The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing. Salmon, soon to be in someone's seafood burrito, is grilled before my eyes. I usually like to go through the meats first and then expand whence my proposed essentials are covered.\n\nChar-broiled steak, black refried beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, lettuce and bits of radish are piled high on a small doubly layered tortilla foundation to make my carne asada super taco ($4). I was left in a brief state of wonder. How to approach eating this masterpiece with ingredient proportionate mouthfuls and limited spillage? I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers.

I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive. The otherwise promised rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and salsa were almost indiscernible. \n\nPancho Villa Taqueria's penchant for eco friendly practices instantly caught my attention. The Aguas Frescas are served in Greenware cups. Upon finishing a meal, the most prominent options are to recycle and compost leftovers. I revel in the taqueria's proactive eco attitude, unlike such unnamed businesses who \"urge\" one to recycle but do not even supply a recycling bin on premises.\n\nPerched on the back wall, a statue of Pancho Villa happily surveys the crowd with gun in hand.

There I would find Pancho Villa. And so I did, and I was happy...for a while.

The egg batter-fried shell the chile relleno had was hard, crunchy and too greasy (it's supposed to be supple and smooth with the texture of an omelette), the green chile was hard as well, the seeds hadn't been removed, and the cheese in the chile was chunked inside, not fully melted.

The wait was too long at Puerto Allegre, also another favorite of mine and we didn't want to go all the way over to El Farolito on 24th and Mission (my absolute favorite for tacos de carne asada) as it was getting late. So, we decided to give Pancho Villa another try. Big mistake. We shared a carne asada \"especial\" burrito with guacamole, cheese, rice and refried beans. The burrito was soooooooooooo salty.

The procession toward the two registers is fairly efficient and not too laborious for bodies opposed to idle behavior. I enjoy this on-the-spot ordering, paying, and receiving. The self-serve format leaves one to relax with the meal without being doted upon or in anxious waiting for a water refill.\n\nThe menu is extensive and appealing. Salmon, soon to be in someone's seafood burrito, is grilled before my eyes. I usually like to go through the meats first and then expand whence my proposed essentials are covered.\n\nChar-broiled steak, black refried beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, lettuce and bits of radish are piled high on a small doubly layered tortilla foundation to make my carne asada super taco ($4). I was left in a brief state of wonder. How to approach eating this masterpiece with ingredient proportionate mouthfuls and limited spillage? I picked up the super taco and opened my mouth as wide as feasibly possible, seeing this as my only option in a hunger induced immediacy. When ordering I was wondering if one taco would do me justice. Wonder no more, one ingredient packed super taco satisfies. \n\nThe taqueria's salsa bar seems a decisive novelty factor, seeing as how the restaurant was recommended to me something along the lines of, \"the place with the salsa bar\" by several friends who take residence in the Mission. And of course I had to try all five salsas with the complementary chips, for research purposes.\n\nThe chile verde chicken super burrito, isn't particularly super for $8.50. Yes, it has all the components desirable in a burrito yet I can't help but fixate on a noticeable saltiness. I countered this with a flirtatious sprinkling of the fire-roasted pastor and pickled carrots from the salsa bar.\n\nA hawker streamlines his way through the tables offering small bouquets of roses intermixed with other flowers. He also holds a slightly beat up pink teddy bear with an early Valentine's Day premise to be sure. The mother of the family sitting next to us bought her self a rose. Her husband looked on while a broad smile spread across her face. \n\nNow lets talk about what put a smile on my face. I am a churro novice so when I saw the custardy cream filled variety ($1.50 for a small) I had to satiate my excited curiosity. Let me tell you, I am not disappointed. The crunchy flaky cinnamon sugar coated pastry encases a perfect tasting rich creamy inside. But this is lunch. I go back for a late night session and the churro of the non cream filled variety is a bit dry. \n\nJacky is a friend of mine from LA and she was disappointed by the taqueria's Tamarindo Aguas Frescas ($2.35). She felt it didn't capture the distinctive Tamarind taste of the traditional fresh fruit drink. To me, it posed as an above average version of iced tea with lemon. \n\nThere is a super vegetable burrito ($6.50) and it was mostly sour cream, which wouldn't bother me normally since I am a sour cream fiend, but this seemed a bit excessive.
