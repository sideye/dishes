It was a big freshroll though. I did wish they made the additional fillings less in price as you pay the same thing when you add toppings to their three roll orders. If getting one roll, it should be less, right? Taste wise, the roll was great! I liked the vietnamese vinaigrette as I like nuoc cham. Especially if I add sambal to it. The other sauce was little too thick and creamy for me. My only complaint about the roll is that they put noodles in there when I noted no noodles. I figured they just don't do rolls without noodles, but a coworker noted the same thing and she didn't have noodles in her roll.\n\nI also ordered a Side of Pho Broth: A side of our all-natural chicken pho broth, with white onions, cilantro, and scallions ($2.49) as I adore soup. This was tasty. Clean with a meaty flavor. There wasn't a lot of cilantro, scallion, etc, but I keep chopped green onions in the fridge at work, so I added some for texture.\n\nBased on my enjoyment of the roll, I want to give them four stars.

"], "author": "Ed U.", "review": "Just in time for the much anticipated opening of the spanking new Target Express, Freshroll decided to open a second outlet right across the street. I do ask myself what my life has become when I get excited about the imminent opening of a mini-Target, but then I see Jamie W.'s palpable excitement and realize I am not alone in my cloistered suburban sensibilities. After all, the big breakthrough was when Target opened at the Metreon revitalizing a retail space that previously looked like a prime candidate for the wrecking ball. Perhaps following the same path, Freshroll looks like it's trying to duplicate its own success at the Metreon by arriving on Bush where ironically another like-minded chain, Freshii, previously failed.\n\nJudging from the opening week queues, the reality is that there is a built-in appetite among FiDi workers for their Chipotle-style operation. One marginal disappointment with this specific location is that they weren't able to secure a permit to allow them to make the pho bowls. They can sell you the chicken pho broth for what it's worth at $1.99 but not the whole shebang. So I had time to ponder my alternate strategy while in line with the overhead menu front and center (photo: http://bit.ly/1Aa0i73). I decided to go for the $8.49 Specialty Rolls, a trio where I could sample the Lemongrass Pork, Roasted Chicken and Baked Tofu at the same time (photo: http://bit.ly/1MkcOGX). The \"standard\" packaging would suit me fine - lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, cucumber, crispy shallots, pickled veggies and jalape\u00f1os.\n\nI threw caution to the wind and paid the $0.99 surcharge for avocado, and to top it off, among the four sauces they offered, I went with the richest one, Grandma's Peanut Sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1E0GioO). Wait, there's more. I also ordered a $1.99 bag of their Homemade Taro Chips to add a little sweet crunch to my lunch (photo: http://bit.ly/18u6Nd7). When I got back to my office to gorge on it, I have to admit I was surprised I enjoyed it, especially the roast chicken selection, since my memories of their Metreon operation are less than charitable when I tried the salad bowl on a couple of occasions there. I have yet to try those here or the sandwiches, but I probably will and hopefully won't be disappointed. Meanwhile, the three roasted chicken rolls will do me just fine.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the rolls rock for a lunchtime option amid the salads and sammies in the immediate vicinity\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...tight quarters for dining in but just fine for a take-out spot\nSERVICE - 3 stars...new, enthusiastic and predictably programmed\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a chain that appears to be improving over time by following Chipotle's success formula", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-03-09"}]}
