We ordered the duck, the chicken, the flat iron steak and the pork sugo pasta.  They were all super delicious but the two that stand out were the roasted chicken (which was SO tender and flavorful) and the pasta, which I asked for HOT (and was pleasantly surprised to find it so).  The pork sugo was just as tender and plentiful as the half chicken dish and was complemented with fresh pasta ribbons.  The fresh pasta was nice, but I'd have eaten the pork on toast.  haha!\n\nWe brought our own dessert (as it was my birthday) so I can't say anything about their sweets.  I'm sure they're just as mouthwatering as the rest of their menu, though.\n\nI DID NOT GIVE THEM 5 STARS because they sat us in the loft, directly above the kitchen/stove.

We took our time with our food and were probably there for 3 hours (maybe 3.5 hrs).

Mustard greens are served with this dish, which I was a little hesitant about, but the chef prepared a nice proportion.  Not too much, and not too little.

This was one of the best salads I've had.\n\nMaple Leaf Duck Breast with Herb Spaetzle, Hearts of Palm Salad, Wild Arugula, Scallions and Huckleberry Sauce - the duck was a bit overcooked, but the herb spaetzle was to die for.  Terrific sauce and combination of flavors.  If the duck were cooked better, it would have been outstanding.\n\nI also ordered the halibut, but I can't remember everything in the dish and it wasn't listed on their website.  I remember it was supposed to have parsnip puree.  This dish was definitely lacking and bland.  I cook halibut at home and there's a lot of potential with this fish - unfortunately, they didn't deliver.  Hopefully they'll mix up this recipe and swap it for something else.\n\nWe ordered the chocolate bread pudding b/c we heard so much fuss about it.  It was just ok and we didn't flip over it.  Maybe it was b/c there was coconut in it and neither of us are coconut fans.  It was well prepared, though, and the hazelnut ice-cream was a nice touch.\n\nOverall great experience and very happy we tried it.

Zagat rates their food as a 26 (quite high) but I'd honestly have to say they're more around the 24 range. Honestly it was a monday night so there were no 'specials' and some of the food may have been less then fresh. For example, I had the rack of lamb dish that they were currently serving and the spinach tasted as if it was a little over the hill (it was rather tough and chewy). The lamb itself was excellent but a bit gamey for my taste (they did not trim it too well). Granted I can sometimes be a bit picky with lamb... The appetizer was quite good (had the russet potato gnocchi). They did a rather good job not over doing the truffle oil as many places often over-do it. The dessert was nothing special but still quite good. The service was very attentive and polite.

I was pleased, but not particularly impressed. Nothing really stood out despite the fact that the food was very solid in regards to its quality overall. This is certainly a place worth stopping in if you enjoy food with a Mediterranean influence. It seems as if things may have gone a little downhill since the first or second time I've been there, but I would still certainly recommend them. The atmosphere is great as is the food. \n\nIt's important to note that when I review I do it far more subjectively in regards to the particular cuisine/restaurant. I may give a hole in the wall sushi restaurant 5 stars and give a location such as this 4.

Both were cooked to perfection and the Octopus was more tender than any I have had before.  The bread pudding was also amazing.\n\nThe OK:\n\nThe porkchop was very good and tender.  The potatoes and bacon pieces on the side were delicious but the sauce it was served with was a little too sweet.  Luckily It was covering the plate and not poured over the pork chop so I just avoided.  Still it would have been nice not to have something as strong.\n\nThe service was a little rude at first but once they calmed down and realized I was a foodie they were amiable.  I just hate the discriminating service I get because I am young, it makes me want to stiff them on tips but then I am just feeding into the cycle.\n\nThe Salmon Bruschetta was OK, it was tasty but did nothing to really wow me.\n\nI will definitely be back here sometime.

As an entree, the papardelle with sugo was just perfect, and to finish it off, the bread pudding was as good as all the reviews say it is.\n\nThis was an excellent choice for a night out in the big city.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-12-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Skip the octopus salad and order another duck confit salad.

So moist and juicy inside, with a nice crispy, well seasoned skin outside.  Skip the halibut which was lukewarm maybe due to the temperature of the beets that were beneath the fish.

And I had an enjoyable meal.  While it got off to a stiff and awkward, it slowly got better and ended on a nice note. \n\nFrascati is a cute little neighborhood restaurant in Nob Hill.  And on a nice evening, they offer the option of sitting curb side.  It was chilly this past Saturday evening, so we sat inside.  Being such a small restaurant, spacing can be a bit cramped throughout the restaurant.  \n\nBut there is also a very nice upstairs \"loft\" dining area overlooking the main dining room.  We had a table upstairs overlooking the sidewalk next to a double-window. \n\nOur dinner reservation was made for 9:15pm, and even being a bit later, the place was still quite packed.  Service definitely got off to a very slow start, with our server took a long time take our order.  Furthermore, he wasn't very friendly and definitely rushed us throughout ordering.  \n\nHowever, when we did have questions about various items, he was quite knowledgeable.  Another small annoying side note about our server was the fact that he also had some bad-ass breath!  I was hoping he wouldn't bend down or lean in as it spoke to us.  Luckily, it only happened twice throughout the night. Haha.  \n\nAppetizers: We started off with the Artisanial Cheese Plate which consisted of 4 Cheeses ($14.00)  However, after ordering our server informed us that they were out of one of the cheeses and only had 3, so they were going to charge us $10.00 instead.  I was quite disappointed about this because of the fact that the Cheese plate was definitely quite highlighted at the top of the menu.  But we made due with the 3 cheeses instead.  \n\nThe cheeses were a great way to start dinner. bit quite small portions.  I would've liked them to compensate with larger pieces of cheese to make up for the 4 type of cheese.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=o02hEw0e299JQ9AU4THxuw\n\nWe also ordered the Roasted Eggplant-Tomato Soup with Creme Fraiche, and the Duck Confit Salad with Baby Spinach, Red Onions, Dried Cherries, Gorgonzola Cheese with a Balsamic dressing.  \n\nThe Eggplant Tomato Soup was bland and boring, I couldn't make out much of the tomato flavor in combination with the eggplant, and it also had a bad \"burnt\" taste to it.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=2gFO8g2k427P71HRvv8YoA\n\nA favorite of mine, and definitely something I'd order again is the Duck Confit Salad.

The overall feel of the dish didn't knock my socks off, as the demi glace sauce had a bit too much wine flavor. A side of Potato Cauliflower Gratin, and Baby Root Veggies were also provided. \n\nThe Duck Breast was was cooked to perfection and the sauce was sweet and flavorful.  Presentation-wise, but the Filet and the Duck had the same plating.  \n\nAs for dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with Almond Roca and Caramelized Bananas.  The Panna Cotta had great Vanilla Bean flavor, but texture was way too pudding-ish in my opinion.  I loved the almond roca on top and the few caramelized banana's were cooked perfectly.  \n\nWhile our server started off unfriendly and rushy, he never failed to be very attentive to our needs...i.e refilling waters and complimentary bread, and he even attempted to sing Happy Birthday to me when my dessert came out.  Very sweet of him.  Overall, I will give him the benefit of the doubt in that, after the crowds died down, he became much better and calmer.  \n\nFrascati is cute neighborhood spot with a cozy dining room.  I would recommend sitting in the loft seating area as it was a bit quieter and intimate with smaller 2 person tables, as opposed to the main dining area.  \n\nOverall of the 3 appetizers we started off with the Duck Confit Salad was my favorite.

There are several other restaurants in the area.  Parking is very difficult and we were lucky to find parking a couple of blocks away.  The cable car runs right by the restaurant.\n\nWe got there at 5:30 and had a nice table by the wall.  It is a small place serving Mediterranean style meals.  Apparently the menus change every week.  We started off with some salads -  a roasted pear salad with acorn squash, butter lettuce, goat cheese, spiced pecans and creamy tarragon vinaigrette ($10).  It was well presented and very tasty.  The dressing was flavorful without being overpowering.  The other salad was a duck confit salad with baby spinach, red onions, dried cherries, gorgonzola cheese and a light balsamic dressing ($11).  It was also very well presented, tasty, and not overpowering.  \n\nFrench bread was provided along with a glassware of olive oil for dipping the bread.  The olive oil had a pleasant flavor and it might have been lemon. \n\nFor our entree, we chose a side of spaghetti squash, seafood fettucine, and a seabass plate.  The prices of the entrees were in the mid $20s.  I can't remember what the items were officially called as I don't have a copy of their menu that week.  My fettucine had mussels, clams, shrimp, drenched in a creamy chopped basil sauce similar to a pesto sauce.  The only downside might be that it was too salty and may have been due to the mussels and clams.  Other than that it was delicious.\n\nThe seabass plate was a fillet that was browned and laying on a bed of assorted mushrooms.  The plate was very well presented and was scrumptous.

One steak dish, one venison, one chicken, one duck, one sea bass, one halibut, one vegetarian (sorry, folks), etc. Sure I missed a couple of 'animals.'

Mustard greens are served with this dish, which I was a little hesitant about, but the chef prepared a nice proportion.  Not too much, and not too little.

And I had an enjoyable meal.  While it got off to a stiff and awkward, it slowly got better and ended on a nice note. \n\nFrascati is a cute little neighborhood restaurant in Nob Hill.  And on a nice evening, they offer the option of sitting curb side.  It was chilly this past Saturday evening, so we sat inside.  Being such a small restaurant, spacing can be a bit cramped throughout the restaurant.  \n\nBut there is also a very nice upstairs \"loft\" dining area overlooking the main dining room.  We had a table upstairs overlooking the sidewalk next to a double-window. \n\nOur dinner reservation was made for 9:15pm, and even being a bit later, the place was still quite packed.  Service definitely got off to a very slow start, with our server took a long time take our order.  Furthermore, he wasn't very friendly and definitely rushed us throughout ordering.  \n\nHowever, when we did have questions about various items, he was quite knowledgeable.  Another small annoying side note about our server was the fact that he also had some bad-ass breath!  I was hoping he wouldn't bend down or lean in as it spoke to us.  Luckily, it only happened twice throughout the night. Haha.  \n\nAppetizers: We started off with the Artisanial Cheese Plate which consisted of 4 Cheeses ($14.00)  However, after ordering our server informed us that they were out of one of the cheeses and only had 3, so they were going to charge us $10.00 instead.  I was quite disappointed about this because of the fact that the Cheese plate was definitely quite highlighted at the top of the menu.  But we made due with the 3 cheeses instead.  \n\nThe cheeses were a great way to start dinner. bit quite small portions.  I would've liked them to compensate with larger pieces of cheese to make up for the 4 type of cheese.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=o02hEw0e299JQ9AU4THxuw\n\nWe also ordered the Roasted Eggplant-Tomato Soup with Creme Fraiche, and the Duck Confit Salad with Baby Spinach, Red Onions, Dried Cherries, Gorgonzola Cheese with a Balsamic dressing.  \n\nThe Eggplant Tomato Soup was bland and boring, I couldn't make out much of the tomato flavor in combination with the eggplant, and it also had a bad \"burnt\" taste to it.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=2gFO8g2k427P71HRvv8YoA\n\nA favorite of mine, and definitely something I'd order again is the Duck Confit Salad.  What an awesome salad to start off with, and quite unlike anything I've ever had before.  The salad wasn't chilled like normal salads, but instead, the spinach was lightly cooked and flavorful.  The duck was also perfectly cooked and crispy in certain parts.  I also love the combination of the sweet dried cherries and the gorgonzola cheese.  Everything in the salad paired together perfectly.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=ovMLhmGuyEoRygfJGoniRQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=Tlgg-eDwy_KX4mx09CwQIw \n\nFor entree's, mom ordered the Maple Leaf Duck Breast and I ordered the Pan Seared Filet Mignon.\n\nMy Filet Mignon was a bit undercooked for my preference as I ordered it Medium, but came out a bit more rare.  The overall feel of the dish didn't knock my socks off, as the demi glace sauce had a bit too much wine flavor. A side of Potato Cauliflower Gratin, and Baby Root Veggies were also provided. \n\nThe Duck Breast was was cooked to perfection and the sauce was sweet and flavorful.  Presentation-wise, but the Filet and the Duck had the same plating.  \n\nAs for dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with Almond Roca and Caramelized Bananas.  The Panna Cotta had great Vanilla Bean flavor, but texture was way too pudding-ish in my opinion.  I loved the almond roca on top and the few caramelized banana's were cooked perfectly.  \n\nWhile our server started off unfriendly and rushy, he never failed to be very attentive to our needs...i.e refilling waters and complimentary bread, and he even attempted to sing Happy Birthday to me when my dessert came out.  Very sweet of him.  Overall, I will give him the benefit of the doubt in that, after the crowds died down, he became much better and calmer.  \n\nFrascati is cute neighborhood spot with a cozy dining room.

However, Frascati fell a bit shy of my expectations.  Our reservations were rather late for a Saturday night so we were seated promptly amidst a bustling restaurant.  Our server was slow to greet us, didn't introduce himself, and was mildly attentive.  Disappointing.  I thought the busboy did a better job at being attentive!  \n\nOnto the food.  Appetizers: The foie gras torchon was quite tasty.  It arrived with two pieces of toasted brioche.  The brioche was TDF. I asked for a few more.  After eating five of them, I discovered they were battered in butter.  No wonder those little devils were so good.  :X  The apple currant compote paired nicely with the foie gras.  I had a nibble of the gnocchi however was not impressed.  It was different and packed a lot of flavor although I am not a fan of gnocchi.  The main entrees were good.  My pork chop was seasoned, succulent, and served with all the right ingredients - eggplant puree, cipollini jus, and red onion marmalade.  Good portion.  Not overly small nor overly large.  The fresh seafood fettuccine was just that...fresh!  I could tell the noodle was made in house because it was fine and \"eggy\".  The seafood in the fettuccine was plentiful and also very fresh.  The pesto was quite inviting.  Of course having a cheese plate on the menu, I had to complete my meal with an order of that.  I love trying new cheeses, they're always so delightful.  My cheese plate included a p'tit basque (sheeps milk), buenalba (goats milk cheese infused with red wine), tallegio (washed cows milk), and maytag bleu cheese.  I enjoyed all of them however my favorites would have ben the p'tit basque and the maytag bleu.  Both very acerbic however the flavors were eased up by the nuts they were served with.\n\nI'm torn.  I would rate this place a 4 for the food, yet 3 for their service.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and round up.  Guess our server was having an off-night.

The corn was incredibly sweet, even though it is not full blown corn season just yet. The morels were earthy and intense, and the rice was not completely mushy, so a slight crunchy texture was evident. The gnocci was also a treat- fava beans are a definite springtime favorite, and they definitely starred in this particular dish. The potato dumplings were the perfect consistency, slightly chewy and melt-in-your mouth delicious. The roasted chicken was seasoned well with rosemary and lemon, the skin crisp, and the meat tender. The artichokes and fingerling potatoes were a great accompaniment. As you may know, I don't eat fish, so I cannot comment on the halibut, but my dad did lick his plate clean, if that counts for anything. Portions here are not huge, so we had room for dessert, a definite must if you find yourself at Frascati. We ordered the black and white chocolate bread pudding, which our waitress assured would be enough for the three of us to share. Maybe she didn't know how much we love chocolate. Or bread pudding. Oh my god, this pudding was amazing. Not as custardy as some, but intensely chocolatey  with crisp bits on the outside and gooey chocolate seeping from the inside. Chunks of white chocolate were interspersed throughout the concoction. A huge scoop of home made vanilla bean ice cream garnished the dish, which was subsequently drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauces. Pure heaven. We wolfed down the entire dessert in under a minute, all of us wishing we had ordered two. But enough is enough, and since I at least, hadn't done my ritual 6 mile morning run, figured it was best to stop. In summary, Frascati is a charming upscale restaurant with delicious five star food and a five star neighborhood. However because the service was so slow, I must remove on of the stars...but don't let that stop you from checking this place out, I am sure you'll enjoy it as much as we did.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-06-15"}], "fresh pappardelle": [{"excerpts": ["For dinner I ordered the  fresh pappardelle with pork sugo.

Great little neighborhood.  The only negative was that the restaurant was pretty empty at 7pm and we don't love to eat in empty restaurants...who does?  But by the time we left at maybe 9 there were more people, although still many tables open.  The service was excellent.  Friendly, able to banter a bit (I have a husband who likes to banter!) and was good with our slow pace.

We started with the beef tartare and I thought it was fine-to-good.  I liked the toasts it came with and maybe it needed a touch of something, not sure what.

Russet Potato Gnocchi w/ Butternut Squash\n2.  Octopus Salad\n3.  Fresh Pappardelle\n4. Maple Leaf Duck Breast.\n\n---\n\n1.  Gnocchi was cooked to perfection.  It was served with Mushrooms and Sage, though they are cut so fine that you won't get a spoonful of just mushrooms.  I myself am not a big fan of mushrooms, but the way the chef prepared this dish made it tasteful, without getting a huge portion of mushroom per bite.  \n\n2.  My favorite was the Octopus Salad.  The Champagne vinaigrette that is served with this salad is very sharp, yet is a great compliment to the Feta, white beans, and cucumbers.  If you are looking to go w/ just one starter, I'd recommend this.  The portion is good sized for two, and a very tasteful starter.  I would have liked to have a little more octopus in the salad (As I am a big octopus fan), but the salad overall was great.\n\n3.  My least favorite of our choices.  While still tasteful, the pappardelle stuck together over time, but came apart without pulling up other pieces.  The pork ragout that is served with is has a very strong flavor but really paired well.  Overall, the flavor I was impressed.\n\n4.  They serve the duck medium rare so you'll have to tell the waiter/waitress how you want it cook, if you want it cooked differently.  I normally each meat medium rare so this was perfect.  Not a single big of duck remained, as it was a great dish.  The duck breast is lean, with little to no fat, and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Mustard greens are served with this dish, which I was a little hesitant about, but the chef prepared a nice proportion.  Not too much, and not too little.  There are enough on the side to taste, but it's not overdone so it drowns out the natural taste of the duck.

The SO wasn't blown away by this halibut either.\n\nMy panna cotta dessert was meh. I was excited for the caramelized bananas but they could have taken the dessert to new heights had they given me a whole banana flambe. The other dessert, warm black and white chocolate bread pudding, was amazing! Yes, you heard right, a CHOCOLATE bread pudding with HAZELNUT ice cream to boot! The pudding had bits of nuts and other ingredients I couldn't quite pin point that added well to its texture. \n\nThey were nice enough to stick a candle in Randy's dessert which was a good excuse for me to sing him the \"Happy Birthday\" song AGAIN (yes, I spoil him).  I couldn't help but wonder if we didn't order dessert, would they have still offered us a birthday treat? Nonetheless, Randy was irked that his dessert wasn't complimentary.

While it got off to a stiff and awkward, it slowly got better and ended on a nice note. \n\nFrascati is a cute little neighborhood restaurant in Nob Hill.  And on a nice evening, they offer the option of sitting curb side.  It was chilly this past Saturday evening, so we sat inside.  Being such a small restaurant, spacing can be a bit cramped throughout the restaurant.  \n\nBut there is also a very nice upstairs \"loft\" dining area overlooking the main dining room.  We had a table upstairs overlooking the sidewalk next to a double-window. \n\nOur dinner reservation was made for 9:15pm, and even being a bit later, the place was still quite packed.  Service definitely got off to a very slow start, with our server took a long time take our order.  Furthermore, he wasn't very friendly and definitely rushed us throughout ordering.  \n\nHowever, when we did have questions about various items, he was quite knowledgeable.  Another small annoying side note about our server was the fact that he also had some bad-ass breath!  I was hoping he wouldn't bend down or lean in as it spoke to us.  Luckily, it only happened twice throughout the night. Haha.  \n\nAppetizers: We started off with the Artisanial Cheese Plate which consisted of 4 Cheeses ($14.00)  However, after ordering our server informed us that they were out of one of the cheeses and only had 3, so they were going to charge us $10.00 instead.  I was quite disappointed about this because of the fact that the Cheese plate was definitely quite highlighted at the top of the menu.  But we made due with the 3 cheeses instead.  \n\nThe cheeses were a great way to start dinner. bit quite small portions.  I would've liked them to compensate with larger pieces of cheese to make up for the 4 type of cheese.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=o02hEw0e299JQ9AU4THxuw\n\nWe also ordered the Roasted Eggplant-Tomato Soup with Creme Fraiche, and the Duck Confit Salad with Baby Spinach, Red Onions, Dried Cherries, Gorgonzola Cheese with a Balsamic dressing.  \n\nThe Eggplant Tomato Soup was bland and boring, I couldn't make out much of the tomato flavor in combination with the eggplant, and it also had a bad \"burnt\" taste to it.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=2gFO8g2k427P71HRvv8YoA\n\nA favorite of mine, and definitely something I'd order again is the Duck Confit Salad.  What an awesome salad to start off with, and quite unlike anything I've ever had before.  The salad wasn't chilled like normal salads, but instead, the spinach was lightly cooked and flavorful.  The duck was also perfectly cooked and crispy in certain parts.  I also love the combination of the sweet dried cherries and the gorgonzola cheese.  Everything in the salad paired together perfectly.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=ovMLhmGuyEoRygfJGoniRQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=Tlgg-eDwy_KX4mx09CwQIw \n\nFor entree's, mom ordered the Maple Leaf Duck Breast and I ordered the Pan Seared Filet Mignon.\n\nMy Filet Mignon was a bit undercooked for my preference as I ordered it Medium, but came out a bit more rare.  The overall feel of the dish didn't knock my socks off, as the demi glace sauce had a bit too much wine flavor. A side of Potato Cauliflower Gratin, and Baby Root Veggies were also provided. \n\nThe Duck Breast was was cooked to perfection and the sauce was sweet and flavorful.  Presentation-wise, but the Filet and the Duck had the same plating.  \n\nAs for dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with Almond Roca and Caramelized Bananas.  The Panna Cotta had great Vanilla Bean flavor, but texture was way too pudding-ish in my opinion.  I loved the almond roca on top and the few caramelized banana's were cooked perfectly.  \n\nWhile our server started off unfriendly and rushy, he never failed to be very attentive to our needs...i.e refilling waters and complimentary bread, and he even attempted to sing Happy Birthday to me when my dessert came out.  Very sweet of him.  Overall, I will give him the benefit of the doubt in that, after the crowds died down, he became much better and calmer.  \n\nFrascati is cute neighborhood spot with a cozy dining room.  I would recommend sitting in the loft seating area as it was a bit quieter and intimate with smaller 2 person tables, as opposed to the main dining area.  \n\nOverall of the 3 appetizers we started off with the Duck Confit Salad was my favorite.

There are several other restaurants in the area.  Parking is very difficult and we were lucky to find parking a couple of blocks away.  The cable car runs right by the restaurant.\n\nWe got there at 5:30 and had a nice table by the wall.  It is a small place serving Mediterranean style meals.  Apparently the menus change every week.  We started off with some salads -  a roasted pear salad with acorn squash, butter lettuce, goat cheese, spiced pecans and creamy tarragon vinaigrette ($10).  It was well presented and very tasty.  The dressing was flavorful without being overpowering.  The other salad was a duck confit salad with baby spinach, red onions, dried cherries, gorgonzola cheese and a light balsamic dressing ($11).  It was also very well presented, tasty, and not overpowering.  \n\nFrench bread was provided along with a glassware of olive oil for dipping the bread.  The olive oil had a pleasant flavor and it might have been lemon. \n\nFor our entree, we chose a side of spaghetti squash, seafood fettucine, and a seabass plate.  The prices of the entrees were in the mid $20s.  I can't remember what the items were officially called as I don't have a copy of their menu that week.  My fettucine had mussels, clams, shrimp, drenched in a creamy chopped basil sauce similar to a pesto sauce.  The only downside might be that it was too salty and may have been due to the mussels and clams.  Other than that it was delicious.\n\nThe seabass plate was a fillet that was browned and laying on a bed of assorted mushrooms.  The plate was very well presented and was scrumptous. The spaghetti squash looked liked spaghetti and it was my first time eating it.  I liked it. \n\nAfterwards they brought out a scoop of their homemade coconut sorbet with a little candle on it.  Like everything else in the place, the dessert was excellent.\n\nFor special occasions, this is a great place to go and we plan on coming back again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend had the sorbet and it was also very excellent.

We had:\n\nAppetizer:\nFoie Gras w/ apple currant compote- delicious!!! Good portion with two pieces of toasted bread (brioche).  The texture is mousse like and I love how the sweetness of the compote compliments the flavor of the foie gras.  The waiter also suggested sweet wine with our foie gras and that definitely added to the party in the mouth.  After we polished off the Brioche I just started spreading it on my table bread.  Yum!\n\nPan Seared Quail Risotto - Portion is huge! The quail was delicious. Very juciy and had quite a bit of meat on it.  The risotto was interesting. Definitely way too much food for me.  I finished about half of it before I was completely stuffed. The risotto rice is larger than i'm use to.  I also thought it was a bit on the saltier side. Other than that great flavors all around.\n\nMaple Leaf Duck Breast - Two large pieces of duck! Super yummy and I love how tender the meat is.  My friend enjoyed it very much.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the chocolate mint ice cream. OMG it was really good. Tasted exactly like eating a mint leaf.
