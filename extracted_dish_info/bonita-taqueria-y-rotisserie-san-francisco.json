The interior is very simple with tables in the front but you must order before you sit down. The menu is simple, not many option but definitely enough options to make a choice. Me and my friend decided to order the NorCal burrito which is beans, choice of meat, gauc, pico de gallo, and instead of rice, it's makes with potatoes. We also got a street side and chips salsa, & gauc for $7.95. This is definitely overpriced because it comes with way too much dip and not enough chips. The burrito came and I split it in half with my friend. The meat is very tender and juicy which I really liked. On the other hand, the potatoes replacing the rice in the burritos is something different. Other than that, it's not really special.

What was eaten was already digesting so we didn't make a big fuss about it but I was pretty shocked.\n\nBetween the 5 of us we ordered:\n\n- 2 burrito bowls\n- 1 veg classic burrito\n- carne asada bonita burrito\n- pascarcito grilled pork taco\n- baja style fried fish taco\n\nThe bowls were huge and they looked like a jungle with way too many things in it so needless to say our friends didn't finish it.\n\nPork taco was good but the fried fish taco stole the show. \n\nBonita carne asada burrito was a good size, tasty but very little pieces of meat inside. It felt really heavy. Two people shared the 2 tacos and the burrito and it felt quite a bit of food and sat heavy on our stomachs later on that I had to skip dinner.\n\nI'd probably try other places around the area if i'm in the neighbourhood again.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-05-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I got guacamole and chips and a carne asade bonita burrito.

Tacko is my usual spot, but since Bonita is new in the neighborhood I wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Bonita burrito with rotisserie chicken. The idea of the juicy flavorful rotisserie chicken as the meat made me so excited. But truly, this burrito was a letdown. Granted, I ordered it without cheese or sour cream because I have a lactose allergy. But still, I've had great burritos that lacked those ingredients. This one just seemed to lack flavor. I wouldn't recommend the black beans in a burrito - how about an option for whole pinto beans?? Also, the chicken. Sadly, it lacked the flavor, and it also had a giant piece of gristle in it which grossed me out.\n\nBased on this burrito, I'd give Bonita a 2-star rating.\n\nBUT, they did redeem themselves somewhat. \n\nIf were up to me, I probably would NOT have given them a second chance. But a friend in town wanted a burrito bowl, chipotle style. Since there are no Chipotles in the Marina, the closest thing I could think of were the burrito bowls at Bonita. So I begrudgingly gave them another try. \n\nThis time I ordered the salad and topped it with carne asada (and warned my friend against the chicken - he ended up ordering the bonita burrito bowl with carne asada). Both the burrito bowl and the salad were very generous portions and both very tasty. I'd recommend the carne asada, much more flavorful.\n\nSo based on the salad and burrito bowl, I'd give Bonita a solid 4-star rating. \n\nGiven the two vastly different experiences, I'm gonna average the two and call this place a 3-star. But they could sway me with more good food to up in to a 4 in the future, so stay tuned for a possibly update.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-12-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Clasico Nachos and an asada Bonita burrito.\n\n"], "author": "Carl W.", "review": "I ordered the Clasico Nachos and an asada Bonita burrito.\n\nNachos were very soggy. Every single chip was wet and disintegrating on the box. Either they were very cheap on the cheese or didn't put any, not quite sure. The pico de gallo was good, probably the only \"good\" thing I ate.\n\nThe burrito is made with box rice and canned beans that had no flavor. The guac was plain, I'm not even sure it was guac, maybe just mashed avocado. The asada was pretty flavorless but had some decent chunks of meat. The tortilla was crisped nicely.\n\nThere were 3 salsas, all pretty weak. One was very spicy, but as with the rest of the meal, was flavorless. The other 2 salsas aren't even worth eating. No flavor, no spice. I don't even know how it's possible to make flavorless salsa but they managed to do it, twice.\n\nOverall I was dissatisfied.

Tacko is my usual spot, but since Bonita is new in the neighborhood I wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Bonita burrito with rotisserie chicken. The idea of the juicy flavorful rotisserie chicken as the meat made me so excited. But truly, this burrito was a letdown. Granted, I ordered it without cheese or sour cream because I have a lactose allergy. But still, I've had great burritos that lacked those ingredients. This one just seemed to lack flavor. I wouldn't recommend the black beans in a burrito - how about an option for whole pinto beans?? Also, the chicken. Sadly, it lacked the flavor, and it also had a giant piece of gristle in it which grossed me out.\n\nBased on this burrito, I'd give Bonita a 2-star rating.\n\nBUT, they did redeem themselves somewhat. \n\nIf were up to me, I probably would NOT have given them a second chance. But a friend in town wanted a burrito bowl, chipotle style. Since there are no Chipotles in the Marina, the closest thing I could think of were the burrito bowls at Bonita. So I begrudgingly gave them another try. \n\nThis time I ordered the salad and topped it with carne asada (and warned my friend against the chicken - he ended up ordering the bonita burrito bowl with carne asada). Both the burrito bowl and the salad were very generous portions and both very tasty. I'd recommend the carne asada, much more flavorful.\n\nSo based on the salad and burrito bowl, I'd give Bonita a solid 4-star rating. \n\nGiven the two vastly different experiences, I'm gonna average the two and call this place a 3-star.

Enter Bonita Taqueria Y Rotisserie, an overwrought name for a tiny Chestnut Street storefront in San Francisco's Marina district.  \n\nBTYR's meal-sized salad, La Campesina Ensalada comes close to perfection.  The salad is big, fresh, and filled with fork-finds like pumpkin seeds, avocado, roasted corn, black beans, and cotija cheese.  The addition of excellent carne asada, for a few dollars extra, puts the salad into the category of things I'd gladly return to on a weekly basis.  \n \nWith its Marina location and a crowd straight out of Marina District Central Casting it's obvious that this isn't an authentic Mexican taqueria.  It's a busy little hive packed with bar-height counters, backless stools, and lots of young beer/margarita drinking patrons who you'll eye-plead with to please vacate their stools before your food is served.  \n\nDespite the salad, not all menu items are created equal.  BTYR was the first place I ever had an ear of Mexican corn (elote) which I disliked.  I'm also not fond of the fact that chips and salsa (pico de gallo) are not provided gratis.  A spicy margarita was delicious, with significant chunks of colorful peppers but no evidence of actual tequila.  These seem like mere quibbles however; as the La Campesina Ensalada with carne asada was that good.\n\nWith Tacolicious on one end of Chestnut, Mamacita on the other, and BTYR sitting in between there's some serious competition here for your Mexican-ish dining dollar.
