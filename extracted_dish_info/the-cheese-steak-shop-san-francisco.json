The boyfriend randomly thought about this place and craved it, so we went for a late Sunday lunch.\n\nOn our first trip to the register, we ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, Hoagie Cheese Steak, Zesty Veggie Sandwich, Steak Fries, and Onion Rings. When we received our order, we got an Italian Hoagie, Zesty Veggie, Fries, and Rings. So the first thing my bf noticed was that they made the wrong Hoagie - he wanted a Hoagie Cheese Steak, but got the Italian Hoagie instead. Then as we waited longer, there was no Philly Cheese Steak - went to the pickup counter, and they never placed the order.\n\nBF gets back in line for the second time - orders Philly Cheese Steak and Hoagie Cheese Steak cause he still wants to get what he planned to order in the first place. This time, he gets the order and gets the Philly Cheese Steak only. He checks the receipt again, the cashier never placed the order for the Hoagie. Granted, we should have checked the receipt before, but we gave the cashier the benefit of the doubt.\n\nNow, mistakes are okay - we all make them, but the cashier was rude about it. She started lecturing him on how he should have made it clear he wanted two separate sandwiches, cause all she kept hearing was cheese steak and assumed one. \n\nAlready the first time around, when they didnt get the order, I feel like the guys cooking or the cashier should have done something to speed up the process for us to get back in line. My bf had to get back in line, which was long, to re order. We pretty much spent the most of our time there waiting for the food to be right.\n\nOn top of it all, our onion rings were completely burnt and all the rings were stuck together and hard, couldn't even take them apart to eat them - why would you serve it out to your customers like that!\n\nOkay, so the food is pretty good, but after this experience, we're pretty scarred. Usually I'm not one to complain on Yelp, but we spent our entire time here pretty pissed. We noticed that the cashier took a few other customers' orders incorrectly too... Get it together woman! And don't be rude to your customers, PERIOD. \n\nSince I don't review solely on one thing, I'll give them 3 stars. Food is good, but the staff working at the time of our visit just didn't give a sh*t.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-12-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Melted cheese, grilled steak, hot peppers, whole roasted garlic cloves, on a buttery toasted hoagie roll...
