I feel like their pulled pork texture doesn't jive well w/ the rest of the burrito. \n\nFinal nail that keeps me from hitting Bacon Bacon breakfast more often is that they put crushed ice in their coffee instead of cubed --\u00a0watery iced coffee really gets my goat (or pig)!", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-05-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Ended up getting the breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint!

Instead the bacon was thin, flavorless, barely there and tasted like the cheap Kirkland (aka Costco) brand. Sad face. If they had used Applewood smoked bacon, you'd be able to taste it.

I didn't consider myself a fan of bacon before coming here, but I have since realized, I just wasn't a fan of the crappy thin, chewy, garbage that surely the pig making it would be ashamed of.
