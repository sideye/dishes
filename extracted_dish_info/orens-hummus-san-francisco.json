I did eat some with the bourekas which wasn't too bad. Out of the two pastries, I liked the mushroom one more. It had more flavor with the earthiness of the mushrooms. The cheese one was bland. Not much cheese and too much dough. I kinda ate the inside and discarded the rest.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong things, but this just wasn't up my alley. Everything was rather tasteless.

We then ordered a couple things to share family style. \n\nWe ordered 6 bourekas: 3 mushroom and 3 potatoes. These were small pastries with some filling inside. The pastry itself was perfect -- quite flaky and buttery. The mushroom filling was quite unique and interesting, and the potato one provided a good hearty taste.\n\nNext for the hummus, we ordered a side of babaganoush eggplant hummus, as well as the lamb hummus bowl. This came with some pita bread for the table. The pita was incredibly fresh, warm, and huge, so you can just dip whatever you want on it.

The lamb hummus was OK, though I wish there was a bit more meat for the dish.\n\nWe also got the shakshuka, which was quite underwhelming and not worth it for the price, as it was basically tomato sauce and eggs.
