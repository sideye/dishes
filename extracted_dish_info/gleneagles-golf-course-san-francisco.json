It is a public 9 hole course that is, frankly, downright hard.  We had boasted about the course to the non-initiated many times and a few weeks ago took one of our buddies who had never played there, expecting he would be impressed.\n\nSURPRISE: the course was absolutely a hole; tees with two foot high weeds growing on them, fairways with huge brown spots.  Unbelievably bad; surprisingly, the greens were in great shape, which made no sense given the extreme state of disrepair on the rest of the course.\n\nI will miss it, but until I hear that they have done something to assuage the deterioration, I will not go back there, it was so painful", "rating": 1, "date": "2011-07-09"}, {"excerpts": ["What I liked the most about the course were the trees.

Sure you have to drive through the low income housing area, but I experienced no problems there during the day.  We were playing golf and the tenants there were doing their own thing.

This course plays like the \"Western--the Good, the Bad and The Ugly\". It is a strange juxtaposition of epic with horrendous.\n\nThe Good. It's cheap. C'mon--green fees of $25 for 9 holes ($28 for another go-around for a total of 18 butt-spankin' holes), even less with a resident card/senior discount?!! The guests who come here are more laid back and not persnickety about course rules--Phhfftsheah! The course manager, Brandon, is cool--he told us as we walked off to \"do our part and water the trees frequently!\" \n\nThe bar is REALLY cool with inexpensive drinks. The manager has allocated resources to maintaining the highest priority areas of the course--greens, parts of fairways you are supposed to reach with each stroke (think green islands) and Tee Offs.\n\nThe Bad. The course is really is a booger at places! The fairways are narrow and break steeply so that your ball will roll to one side. The rough is ball ingesting and nigh impossible to search through. There are parts that are muddy that will soil your buggy, shoes, and club (and pants if you send a shot into the rough). The Tee-offs are inconsistently marked and sometimes located in counter-intuitive places. We tee'd off one hole, walked 20 yards and discovered the real tee off for it... Weird.\n\nThe Ugly. The aeration holes and patching mesh on the green kicks and skews the putt like a pinball machine flapper. The brown patches of fairway (which I visited often in my noobness) are brutal because there is.no.green.grass for your next shot. My kind uncle kept reminding me I could move the ball in a one foot radius 'for improvement'... Let's review my options: how about that glob of mud, or sundried weed, maybe that rock perch...? And, just when you thought you made it home on the 9th, the green there is a wicked ski-slope--positioned strategically as entertainment for those who have gone before to heckle you as the ball is putted haplessly from one end of the green to the other.\n\nAll said, it is a low-key place for me to bash the ball around without too much recourse :) For that, I am a fan--4 stars!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Clubhouse is nice and the green fees are cheap"], "author": "Theodore N.", "review": "Three stars is just about right for this place. \n\nCons- Fairways and tee-boxes are some of the worst I have ever seen. \n\nPros-Greens are very good.

You have to have the right attitude about your golf there.  It's really about survival, as opposed to making a good score.  The course is sort of tricked up with some extreme slopes on the greens, and depending on how the greens-keeper's meds were going that week, there can be some truly evil hole locations which make for 4 putting.\n\nRumor has it that a famous PGA player once stormed off this course saying it was set up unfairly.
