I was fully expecting to find nothing open at 9pm at night, but sure enough, Burger Joint's \"Open\" sign was lit.  \n\nInside, the store was extremely clean - the floors shiny and tabletops sans scraps, crumbs, or other detritus that might make you think twice.  There were only 2 people working - one at the register and another on the grill.  Both were friendly when I asked advice for parking outside, and when I came back to order, service was prompt and with a smile.  Bonus.  \n\nOn to the food...  I ordered a \"Mini Cheeseburger and Fries,\" $6.95.  Okay, you might think that's a little pricey for a \"Mini\" (tack on another $1.50 for a Standard size Chee'burger), but these aren't frozen Costco patties they're serving.  The Niman Ranch beef was tender, flavorful, and cooked-to-order on the plainly visible (from the counter) grill.  The toppings were as fresh as could be - green leaf lettuce (no iceberg here!), dill pickle chips, red onion, fresh tomato, and mayonnaise applied without excess...a definite plus.  The french fries were thick, steak fries and were nice and crispy.  Not too salty, not bland, either.  \n\nMusic soundtrack seemed pretty diverse, but the important thing is that the volume was not cranked up to ear-bleeding levels.  All in all, the Burger Joint really hit the spot.

Small, diner like decor.  Typical diner setting, bunch of tables and a few booths.  They are simple, they offer, burgers, hot dogs and fries.  The burgers offered are the following: cheeseburger, hamburger, chicken burger, veggie burger.  In addition there are hot dogs and french fries.  The cheeseburger comes in a mini size also ( equivalent to a McDonalds Cheeseburger size) which is good if you aren't willing to up your cholesterol too many points in one day.  \n\nThe burgers and dogs are made with Niman Ranch meat.  With that knowledge you then expect a higher quality burger and taste.  To be honest, my first bite was delicious, but then the following bites started to get salty for me.  Too salty for my taste.
