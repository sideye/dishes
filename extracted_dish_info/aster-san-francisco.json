The sourdough was warm and fluffy- definitely might be the best sourdough I've ever had.\n\nThe appetizers at Aster were the star of the show, while we found the entrees good, but uninspired. So that we could maximize our tasting potential, my husband and I ordered different things and split every course.\n\nCourse 1: dry aged beef tartare with rice puffs and a market salad.  Both were freaking amazing. The tartare was in tiny cubes topped with aioli and it just melted in your mouth. The rice puffs provided a nice crunchy contrast. When I first saw the market salad, my first thoughts were meh, salad, how boring. This salad, however, was super unique and unlike any other salad I've had. The fruits provided a sweet crispness, but there was also a strong umami flavor and sesame seeds. Who knew salads could be so fancy???\n\nCourse 2: slow cooked egg and rye spaetzle - you really can't go wrong with a slow cooked egg, honestly.  As expected it was deliciously creamy and well balanced with the things it was served with.  The spaetzle was the pleasant surprise.  My only encounters with spaetzle has been with a typically German preparation. The spaetzle was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside- it really gives a whole new meaning to spaetzle for me. Highly recommend \n\nCourse 3: lamb 3 ways and the trout - this is where our dinner became a little more normal. The lamb 3 ways was definitely the winner. The lamb was juicy and moist, but not a revelation like our other courses. The trout, unfortunately, is the reason for the drop in the star. The flavors were nice and rich, but unevenly distributed over the trout, and it was slightly over cooked.  Nothing makes me sadder than overcooked fish :(\n\nCourse 4: an amuse-bouche if you will... since it was our anniversary, they brought us out a rice gelato with umeboshi. It's a really interesting combination of super salty and sour with the umeboshi balanced with the sweetness of the gelato. I'm not sure I crave it, but it sure did take my taste buds on an interesting trip.\n\nCourse 5: dessert!!!! Strawberry 3 ways and chocolate custard - the strawberry was super light and refreshing, with lots of floral hints. On the other end, the chocolate custard was creamy and rich.

I enjoy salads, but don't necessarily think they're worth ordering at an upscale restaurant. BUT THIS SALAD WAS GOOOOOOD. Tons of flavors and depth. BF is anti-salad and he agreed that this was tasty! \n\nSquid: tender, cooked perfectly. Just wish there was more!! \n\nRye and morel spaetzle: we loveee spaetzle. My family lives in Germany so we're no stranger to the dish, but this was a pleasant twist!! The morels make it meaty and savory. This dish is a must get!! \n\n\nTrout: the trout was cooked medium rare, which is fine for us. Skin was crispy! And the miso dashi was delicious. Overall, a light dish but still was flavorful. \n\n\nDuck: NOMMMM. Another standout dish. BF usually isn't a fan of duck breast, but really enjoyed this one. Skin was crispy and the meat was tender, not chewy. Then you get a bit of the duck confit on the side which was DELICIOUSSSS. \n\nCocoa nib financier: interesting dish. More savory due to the goat cheese foam, so order this if you're not a fan of sweets. \n\nChocolate custard: this dish isn't the prettiest lol, just a lot of brown and not a fan of the shape.

This dish was just spectacular! From the dry aged beef, brown rice crisp to the uni - everything was in harmony. The pickled plum gave the dish a nice touch of brightness. The uni was a very good addition, creamy and salty to round out all the flavors.\n\nSecond Course - SOFT-COOKED EGG\n\nMuch like the first course, this one was an awesome dish as well.

Even with the bacon and salmon roe combination, the dish was not overly salty but instead worked in tandem.\n\nThird Course - PORK\n\nThat pork dish was just delish!

You can order anything Ala carte, or if your entire table chooses to do so, you can get a tasting menu - with one item from each four sections - for $65. Each person gets to choose the dish they want from each section, so if you have a group of four and want to try a lot of things, you actually could try everything for $65 per person.

I was impressed by this because they actually pair a wine with every dish. And like I said, we got a lot of different dishes and each one came with a different wine, and they kept them straight and remembered which was which. Also, they were unique wines. A few from grapes I had never heard of! So that was fun to just try some new wines. It seemed like they had really put time and effort into their wine selection.\n\nBest dish of the night in my opinion was the duck. It was just really really perfectly cooked, and the sauce that came with it was light enough to not over power, but still flavorful. I also thought that the Halibut was extremely good. Not over cooked at all and the miso dashi complemented it very well. \n\nThe soft cooked egg was also very flavorful.

We started off with their sourdough bread which is something Aster is known for. The fuyu persimmon appetizer was a unique but delicious bite. The potato dumplings were warm and paired nicely with the crunchy black trumpet mushrooms. My main dish was the pork with miso potatoes, Brussels sprouts and grapes - everything juicy and flavorful. Then we were treated to a special sorbet dish compliments of the chef for our anniversary. That might have been my favorite part! My poached pear dessert was so good, something I wish I could mimic in my own kitchen! \n\nAster was yet another amazing Michelin experience. We were stuffed by the end, and it was half the price of most Michelin restaurants.

"], "author": "Lexi W.", "review": "I flew into San Francisco on Monday morning and bee-lined for Aster that same night. It is my first Michelin restaurant in California, though it certainly won't be my last, and I was really excited to give it a try. \n\nI made a reservation via OpenTable and received a call from the hostess the day before confirming it. She also checked to make sure that there were no food allergies or religious preferences, and whether it was a special occasion. (It wasn't officially but for the record, eating is always a special occasion in my book!)\n\nAster has a clean, contemporary California feel. It's dimly lit but not romantic per se. It's more of a cool edginess. We absolutely loved the ambiance. While the mirrored panels at the ceiling made the restaurant seem like it goes on forever, it's smaller than I expected. It probably only seats 40(ish?) people, and about a third of that is made up of just one large elevated table that runs the length of the restaurant. The open kitchen runs the length of the far end wall. \n\nService was just OK, which disappointed me a bit. I wanted a little more assistance with the dishes as some of the ingredients were foreign (or just plain hidden). Two of the plates came directly from the kitchen and the server explained the best way to eat them, but for all the rest we were left to our own devices. (Is that even a complaint?)\n\nIt was both of our first visit to Aster so we both elected to do the four course menu and selected different items for each course so that we could try more of the menu. (Re: the tasting menu, it's $65 per person and the whole table must participate. The menu is split into four courses with four choices in each.) We had the following:\n\nCourse 1: \n- PINK LADY APPLES, yuzu preserve, brown butter-squash, yogurt, arugula ($16): just OK\n- DRY AGED BEEF, pickled plum, brown rice crispy, kimchi furikake ($18): really tasty. The ageing process enhanced the beef's natural flavors. \n\nCourse 2:\n- THUMBELINA CARROTS, sunchoke, coconut, black lime ($16): unbelievable! Sunchokes are trending hard right now and this was honestly my favorite dish of the night. \n- SOFT-COOKED EGG, nori, puffed rice, salmon roe, bacon vinaigrette ($15): a little more on the Japanese spectrum. The salmon roe added some of that bonita flake flavor you find in a good ramen shop, and the puffed rice changed the consistency of the entire dish (in a good way).\n\nCourse 3:\n- PORK, miso potatoes, brussels, grapes, verjus ($28): perfectly cooked and beautifully plated. I would eat this EVERY DAMN DAY.\n- DUCK, celeriac, quince, maitake, grains of paradise ($29): again, perfectly cooked. I didn't think the plating of this dish was particularly great but I had one bite and none of that mattered. Really excellent. \n\nCourse 4:\n- POACHED PEAR, pistachio, vanilla ($12): YUM. This dessert was delicate and oh-so-tasty! \n- COCONUT COFFEE TART, futsu squash, lime ($12): I liked the tart but the crust was a bit tough. I almost flipped the whole tart off the plate trying to cut it with my dessert spoon. Flavor was great, though, and I loved the savory coffee flavor in contrast to the sharp lime sorbet. \n\nWe also ordered the SOURDOUGH ($5). As expected in SF, the bread was on point! The portion was only four slices served with a whipped and salted butter, but they were BIG slices. I took most of it home and enjoyed it with that excellent salty butter and a strong black coffee the next morning - very European, right?\n\nOverall, at $65pp (not including the $42 wine pairing), the pricing felt fair for the quality of the meal.

For starters, we had the aged beef tartare, which was particularly beefy and raw tasting (thanks to the dry aging). We also had the brassicas, a light dish of root vegetables.

The wild mushrooms with farro was a tasty dish as well, but my favorite was the duck breast, which was tender and had such a distinctive flavor--it also came with shreds of salty duck confit, which really brought the flavors of the dish over the edge!\n\nDessert here was definitely a highlight--the poached pear was served in a light syrup and filled with ice cream--so tender and not overly sweet. The frozen chocolate was unbelievable--the chocolate mousse was thick and creamy without being too heavy, and it was topped with a crunchy meringue, slightly tart huckleberry jam, and surrounded with cacao nibs, which added the perfect crunchy texture to the soft, delicate mousse. \n\nOverall, this was a great place for dinner--every dish was good, but some particularly stood out--the potato dumplings and frozen chocolate were probably the highlights for me!

I really do. I thought the food was good, but wasn't blown away despite its Michelin star status. The restaurant is really cute (perfect for date night!), the host was really friendly, but the meal was overall a little disorganized and overpriced...\n\nI was a little disgruntled to start because the restaurant raised their prices AFTER I booked my reservation on May 1 for June 10; well over a month in advance. This was when the prix fixe menu was priced at $65 pp, which I consider a good deal for a nice restaurant San Francisco. However, less than 24 hours before my reservation, I received a lovely voice message from the restaurant saying they have increased the price to $75 pp. Really.... I would expect them to either to 1) have notified me when they increased the price on June 1 as a courtesy; 2) honor the price made for guests who made reservations prior to June 1; or 3) list on their website their expected price change. I just think they have communicated/handled this poorly. \n\nI expressed my disappointment to the host, who said he'd ask, but never got back to me, so I had to reach out to him again at the end of my meal when we got the bill. I was referred to the restaurant manager who wouldn't budge about her decision and was not accommodating whatsoever. I'm also a little peeved that they didn't notify me until after the meal... At $75, I probably would have reconsidered dining here had I known about this price increase. $75 is a good threshold for price point. And they have a list of upcoming reservations, shouldn't they be transparent and let us know earlier? \n\nAnyway, onto the food:\nLike I said, it's a 4 course prix fixe menu. 1 cold app, 1 warm app, main, and dessert. I really appreciate that the dishes were all on the more light and refreshing side. I loved the egg bowl bacon dish because duh, bacon. The crispy rice added a nice texture to the dish. The granita dessert was awesome as well and perfect for a hot summer day. All dishes were plated so beautifully and totally instagram-worthy, so keep your phone in your pocket to take pictures. FYI, they charge $5 for the bread, which I personally did not think was worth it. However, my fiance liked it because the bread was soft and not crunchy like most sourdough breads.\n\nAs for service... We felt we were ignored for quite awhile and two different servers asked what drinks we'd like to order. They also forgot to bring packed leftovers when we paid the bill. My Lyft driver was outside when I realized this and scrambled back into the restaurant to pick up m boxed food.\n\nOverall, Aster was just an average meal, with some improvements to be made. I have gained a huge appreciation for chefs ever since watching Chef's Table on Netflix (haha). Chef Brett Cooper's has such a cool culinary experience such as developing the fire cooking program at Saison, cooking with now chef of State Bird Provisions, etc... so I was a little disappointed.\n\nAlso, note that this restaurant is pretty small and you may end up sitting at the communal table.

I don't think that the cracker is the best way to serve this cheese.

Having heard a lot about Aster, and its recent inclusion on SF's Michelin List for 2016, I wanted to make sure that I gave it a fair shake before writing it off as a place to try but not in a hurry to get to.  In coming here with my in-laws, and knowing how hard it can be to sometimes come to a consensus on what to eat, Aster's four course menu option at $59/person seemed like the best way to go so that everyone could be satisfied with their meal.  That being said, it was pretty amusing that we all generally gravitated towards the same menu items save dessert. Since full participation is required by all parties at the table for the four course menu, we did our best to cover as much ground as possible. In any case, here's what went down that evening among the four of us:\n\nAppetizers (I):\nChicories, Olive, Early Girl Tomato & Buttermilk\nChilled Golden Beet Soup with Mussels, Pistachio Crumble, Dill\n\nI had the chicories salad and was a little hesitant about the inclusion of olives (not a huge fan) but actually this was really delicious and light! The tomatoes break up the saltiness of the salad, so it actually turned out to being a very well-balanced dish!\n\nAppetizers (II):\nPotato-Caraway Dumplings, Maitake, Brussels, Yogurt\nSweetbreads with Pickled Summer Squash, Charred Peppers, Thyme\nSourdough bread\n\nI absolutely loved the dumplings! I tried a half of the sweetbreads dish, and to be totally honest, I was annoyed that I had forfeited half of the dumplings dish for the sweetbreads.

The sourdough bread that came was also incredible, and the presentation of the softened butter on the plate was genius since we were sharing. \n\nMains:\nTrout with Tokyo Turnip, Grapes, Charred Scallion, Brown Butter\nPork Shoulder with Sweet Potato, Umeboshi, Grilled Bok Choy\n\nI didn't get around to trying the trout, but the pork shoulder was good! It was a little on the small side for a main, so if you're looking for a hefty entree, be prepared. The pork was presented in little cubes/bite-sized, and was definitely pretty to look at.\n\nDessert:\nPink Lady Apple with Brioche, Sunflower Seed, Shiso\nFrozen Yogurt with Concord Grape, Sourdough\nChocolate Ganache with Black Caramel and Cocoa Nib\n\nI had the frozen yogurt, and I couldn't be more surprised when the dish came out and it was totally not what I was expecting!

I personally like the fat, but for those looking for a healthier option, I thought I should note it.  The squash was kind of mushy, and the mandarin oranges didn't make sense to me.  I did not taste any sort of furikake.  Though the pork was cut in large bite size pieces, I would have liked a steak knife to cut it with.

We had:\n\nSourdough Bread (5 stars) - Just get it.\n\n1st Course:\nHalibut (I'm preggo so taking the hubby's word - 5 stars) - Light and refreshing, paired excellently with the cool cucumber\nBeets (2.5 stars) - I was disappointed with this one. The beets were fantastic, but only because they were fresh. I thought the pistachio topping was overwhelmingly salty. \n\n2nd Course:\nChilled Garlic Soup (4 stars) - Although my husband wasn't a huge fan, I loved. It was light and refreshing. Not garlicky as one would think. I thought the fresh herbs, nuts, and peas added texture and complexity without taking away from the base.\nCarrots (4 stars) - Simple yet divine. The toasted coconut added a great crunch to the dish. The black lime puree was also delightful. TBH I could have licked the plate.\n\n3rd Course:\nPork (3 stars) - Although the meat was expertly cooked, I felt that the pairing with the grits and smokey turnips was a bit off. Polenta would have been a much better choice. \nTrout (5 stars) - Trout is a tough customer and well this was just perfect: skin had that crunch and a soft, flaky interior. It paired well with the soured greens. One comment, the pureed nettle didn't add to the palate of the dish.\n\n4th Course:\nVacherin (5 stars) - Wow! Now this is where the Michelin star came from. A very delicate dessert with great citrus and floral notes. \nCheese (Tomme dolce) (4 stars) - I loved this cheese! But I would have liked a better cracker. The salted rye crisp didn't agree with the preserve.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-07-19"}, {"excerpts": ["- The sourdough and cultured butter were 100% worth the cost.

The seasoning on it is really nice, though, with the red espelette powder.  What made the dish was the charred avocado dip, which was smooth and like a more refined version of guacamole (minus onions, tomato)\n\nSmall plates: \n- Pig head croquettes: definitely eat these warm. As you would expect, they're quite tender and soft on the inside, crisped outside, but I don't love head meat); the sliced kumquats help to cut some of the heaviness\n- Young lettuces: good dressing but a little too heavily dressed for me. The leaves were tender, but the highlights were the pickled beets and the shaved and crisped carrots on top\n- Delta asparagus: I can't resist anything that has an egg on it, but it ended up being a dish sitting in a pool of egg yolk, which did the job for richness. The asparagus was ridiculously tender, and it still stood up well to the ham hock (I was scooping up every last bit of that). I could have used another of this dish\n\nLarger plates: \n- Potato black pepper dumplings: I had read about the nettle ones, but I know nettles are fleeting in their season. These dumplings were the favorite of the larger plates and possibly an overall favorite.  They are nicely seared outside with a softer texture inside, but it still had bite. The accompaniments made the dish: roasted tender turnips, spring peas (not as sweet I would expect for this time of year?), maitake mushrooms (love these!). This is definitely a must-get and doesn't feel like a vegetarian dish at all\n- Black cod: a close contender for the second favorite. The cod is super tender, but the highlight is this smoked bone broth underneath and the crouton that soaks up all the juice. The chard leaf it's wrapped in makes it a little harder to cut, but the stems were really nice in the broth below. Definitely eat this one with a spoon and don't miss this dish\n- Pork shoulder: a little richer and a little more standard in flavors, but the smooth new potato, rhubarb, and grilled broccoli were nice\n- Dry age beef: medium rare and sliced, so it's easy to share. The beef texture was good, but flavor wasn't amazing. What was amazing, though, was the green farro and pioppini mushroom porridge underneath that had amazingly rich flavors and good texture (I usually do NOT like farro)\n\nDesserts:\n- Poached rhubarb: we debated over this but were curious. The rhubarb was diced up, cooked down a little, and tart in flavor. It sat on a white creamier thing underneath (forgot what it was) and was unique, but not sure I would order it again\n- Beet and cara cara orange cremeux: not everyone loves beets, but I actually really like the subtle beet flavor and smooth texture. Some people thought the beet was a little too strong, but the cara caras really help balance it out\n- Frozen chocolate: probably the favorite dessert. The center is like a frozen rectangle of chocolate ice cream or semifreddo, but the mandarin oranges, cocoa nib, and mostly, the basil, really make the dish. I loved the basil with chocolate and have never thought to pair the two since you usually just see mint with chocolate\n\nFood came out at a reasonable pace, and they never rushed us even though we definitely took our time getting started.

Cod wing was interesting, prepared with spicy yuzu and plum vinegar. It was soft, light, and a bit tangy. Young kale was like a salad that came with delicious carrot chips. Green garlic soup was tasty, not very garlic and Aster split the portion into two bowls without me or my husband asking. Each portion was the size of one full portion! Potato dumplings were pretty delicious, a bit peppery, but that added some good heat, tasted like gnocchi, served maitake mushrooms, peas and charred scallions. I was so full already, but dessert did not disappoint! The frozen chocolate was yummy. Husband ordered the green elixir which tasted good.\n\nDecor/ambiance- good use of the space and sleek design/decor. Dimly lit so each table had additional candlelight. If you want brighter lighting, dine here earlier. We had 7:30pm reservations and they dimmed the restaurant even more during our meal.\n\nService- staff are friendly and took our order accurately. However, our waiter came by and told us he will get us water when another staff member already poured us water. Another instance (I forget the details) suggested he didn't remember something.

From $7 beer in a plastic pee pee cup, $15 sammies, to a $49 million condo (yes, it exists: http://bit.ly/1CsQQ1V).

For date night, I picked Aster, the new restaurant that opened last week in the old Beast And The Hare space from the Daniel Patterson Group (Coi, Plum, Alta CA). The New American menu is small and focused with 3 small bites ($4-$6), 4 apps ($14-$17), 4 entrees ($27-$34), and 3 desserts ($12). Wines by the glass was about $12-$42. Prices included tip but not tax. \n\nOur waiter recommended that each person order one dish from each category but $200 for a regular date night was too spendy so we ordered 1 small bite, 1 app, and 1 dessert to share, and we each ordered our own entr\u00e9e. Portions are tiny for the high prices but we didn't leave hungry. If you have large appetite, I would plan for a second dinner: 20 piece McD nuggets for $5. FTW!\n\nWe started with the Pig Croquettes ($6) had an uber soft gelatinous center with a nice, crunchy crust: http://bit.ly/1CsQQ1V. Good amuse bouche-type starter. \n\nEverything we had after that was underwhelming. Nothing was remotely bad but when compared to all the other brand new restaurants we visited this year (BDK, Sous Beurre Kitchen, Dragon Beaux, Liholiho, Al's Place, Cockscomb, Californios, and The Progress) nothing stood out. \n\nThe Cold Smoked Trout ($17) was ok but I wish there was more smoke essence: http://bit.ly/1DbLCJp.

The latter was wonderful and highly recommended. \n\nService was polite but there were some kinks as to be expected with any new restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly but went MIA after we received our order that we had to request a knife from the manager (?), and ordered dessert from the hostess. \n\nContemporary rustic space with track lighting. Good for small groups only but there is a large communal table (fits 12) which I believe are for walk-ins. \n\nParking is horrible in the area but there's a parking lot 2.5 blocks away on 21st and Bartlett. \n\nI feel bad for just giving 3 stars but the prices were too high for underwhelming food.

There is just something so odd about that to anyone who has lived in SF for more than a decade. Aster is the kind of restuarant that would have been in another neighborhood a decade ago or even five years ago. While the decor and service were casual enough, the prices and food was far more Fidi or Marina.\n\nTip is included in the price but surprisingly not tax and you would be hard pressed to leave here without spending at least 50 a person. Even with just one entree per person it would be 30 a person. The server recommended we EACH do one plate from each of the four courses which would have been around 100 a person which puts this out of the daily dinner rotation. The New American menu is small and focused with 3 small bites ($4-$6), 4 apps ($14-$17), 4 entrees ($27-$34), and 3 desserts ($12). Wines by the glass was about $12-$42. \n\nWe did end up getting 2 small bites, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert as well as a dish they accidentally prepared for us and we didn't pay for. We also had two bottle of sparkling water at 7 dollar a bottle. Total came to $140 including tax.\n\nIt's still 4 stars because the food was good, really good. The flavours were all there in every dish. The bread that was present in so many dishes was just as good as I remembered it at Outerlands. The food was interesting without being flavourless or too precious. \n\nWe started with\n\n1. bread ($4) which is considered a small bite which is just odd and a practice I despise. But it's delicious bread that we kept and used throughout our meal.\n\n2. Pig Croquettes $6 which are very soft with gelatinous pig cheeks inside a crisp shell. If you are expecting more a fritter texture avoid these. I enjoyed them and 4 is the right amount for this rich meat bonbon.\n\n3.The cold smoked trout ($17) was very light on the smoke and a rather small dish for the price. I couldn't help but compare it unfavourably to the smoked trout at Al's Place that was cheaper and better tasting. The dish was enjoyable with all the flavours you'd expect in a Scandinavian inspired dish.\n\n4. Green Garlic soup, olive oil crouton, pickled fennel, lemon  ($14) as good as any we've eaten in the spring in the south of France this dish was a hit with the French Spouse who felt strongly it needed a poached egg on top.\n\n5. Black Pepper-Potato Dumpling entr\u00e9e ($27) had a nice combination of flavours for me but I felt there wasn't the right portion of starch to vegetables. The French Spouse loved the dish and the gnocchi like tiny dumplings. \n\n6.Black cod. chard leaves and pickled stems, miso levain, smoked cod broth (34) This was beautiful dish with amazing vibrant flavours, delicate fish and a broth I would have loved to drink by the cup. It was also a rather small piece of fish for $34.\n\n7.Strawberry vanilla, cultured cream, chamomile ($12) This was simply a deconstructed strawberry sponge cake. It tasted good but was in no way at the same level as the savory dishes and 12 for dessert needs to be something more than that.\n\nWe also were given delta asparagus ham hock, alliums, egg yolk ($16) which we did not order and were not charged for. It was tasty but not memorable.\n\nI get a little sick of restaurants that spend more on the decor than they do on the food but I loved the decor here. No freaking wood on the walls and they actually soundproofed the entire ceiling. They had a very simple to make but highly creative lighting system on custom metal channels and with the use of mirrors and a black ceiling really expanded the space while keep the sound baffling. They used soft fabrics on the long banquets and burlap on the walls. The huge problem with the decor is having a door that doesn't close and clientele that are so clueless or entitled that they can't seem to close the door. Do not sit near the door or you will be cold from the door constantly being open. The reception person was oblivious to it with other servers and patrons having to close it as she just stood there. I am not sure how a wheelchair can access the space with narrow double door unless the second door is unlocked and the aisles are narrow. Walk-ins were seated at the huge communal table which is not wheelchair accessible. The tables are very close together and we got to hear all about how the table next to us was evicting people from the Mission building they just bought and how hard it is to find good contractors in the city. That kind of sums up the patrons here.  \n\nWith the influx of tech money in the Mission who also go out for every meal and the national level attention Brent Cooper already has this place will be popular. For a DPG restaurant this is far better than Alta CA but targeting the exact same demographic and it succeeds at that.\n\nI would love to come and try more of the menu but with delicious and cheaper places like Al's Place so close by, it will be a while before I return.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-04-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Cold smoked trout was the best I have tasted and I tasted many , it is one of my favorite dishes and here it was done to perfection.

I actually used the bread to soak up the remaining miso from the radish dish, which I thought was a better use for it\n- Miso marinated pickled radish: everyone at the table wanted to skip this one (except me!), and it ended up being well liked - it's slightly pickled with a hint of miso richness\n- Chicharrones: not as light as I expected and slightly stale in texture. The seasoning on it is really nice, though, with the red espelette powder.  What made the dish was the charred avocado dip, which was smooth and like a more refined version of guacamole (minus onions, tomato)\n\nSmall plates: \n- Pig head croquettes: definitely eat these warm. As you would expect, they're quite tender and soft on the inside, crisped outside, but I don't love head meat); the sliced kumquats help to cut some of the heaviness\n- Young lettuces: good dressing but a little too heavily dressed for me. The leaves were tender, but the highlights were the pickled beets and the shaved and crisped carrots on top\n- Delta asparagus: I can't resist anything that has an egg on it, but it ended up being a dish sitting in a pool of egg yolk, which did the job for richness. The asparagus was ridiculously tender, and it still stood up well to the ham hock (I was scooping up every last bit of that). I could have used another of this dish\n\nLarger plates: \n- Potato black pepper dumplings: I had read about the nettle ones, but I know nettles are fleeting in their season. These dumplings were the favorite of the larger plates and possibly an overall favorite.  They are nicely seared outside with a softer texture inside, but it still had bite. The accompaniments made the dish: roasted tender turnips, spring peas (not as sweet I would expect for this time of year?), maitake mushrooms (love these!). This is definitely a must-get and doesn't feel like a vegetarian dish at all\n- Black cod: a close contender for the second favorite. The cod is super tender, but the highlight is this smoked bone broth underneath and the crouton that soaks up all the juice. The chard leaf it's wrapped in makes it a little harder to cut, but the stems were really nice in the broth below. Definitely eat this one with a spoon and don't miss this dish\n- Pork shoulder: a little richer and a little more standard in flavors, but the smooth new potato, rhubarb, and grilled broccoli were nice\n- Dry age beef: medium rare and sliced, so it's easy to share. The beef texture was good, but flavor wasn't amazing. What was amazing, though, was the green farro and pioppini mushroom porridge underneath that had amazingly rich flavors and good texture (I usually do NOT like farro)\n\nDesserts:\n- Poached rhubarb: we debated over this but were curious. The rhubarb was diced up, cooked down a little, and tart in flavor. It sat on a white creamier thing underneath (forgot what it was) and was unique, but not sure I would order it again\n- Beet and cara cara orange cremeux: not everyone loves beets, but I actually really like the subtle beet flavor and smooth texture. Some people thought the beet was a little too strong, but the cara caras really help balance it out\n- Frozen chocolate: probably the favorite dessert. The center is like a frozen rectangle of chocolate ice cream or semifreddo, but the mandarin oranges, cocoa nib, and mostly, the basil, really make the dish.

I actually used the bread to soak up the remaining miso from the radish dish, which I thought was a better use for it\n- Miso marinated pickled radish: everyone at the table wanted to skip this one (except me!), and it ended up being well liked - it's slightly pickled with a hint of miso richness\n- Chicharrones: not as light as I expected and slightly stale in texture. The seasoning on it is really nice, though, with the red espelette powder.  What made the dish was the charred avocado dip, which was smooth and like a more refined version of guacamole (minus onions, tomato)\n\nSmall plates: \n- Pig head croquettes: definitely eat these warm. As you would expect, they're quite tender and soft on the inside, crisped outside, but I don't love head meat); the sliced kumquats help to cut some of the heaviness\n- Young lettuces: good dressing but a little too heavily dressed for me. The leaves were tender, but the highlights were the pickled beets and the shaved and crisped carrots on top\n- Delta asparagus: I can't resist anything that has an egg on it, but it ended up being a dish sitting in a pool of egg yolk, which did the job for richness. The asparagus was ridiculously tender, and it still stood up well to the ham hock (I was scooping up every last bit of that). I could have used another of this dish\n\nLarger plates: \n- Potato black pepper dumplings: I had read about the nettle ones, but I know nettles are fleeting in their season. These dumplings were the favorite of the larger plates and possibly an overall favorite.  They are nicely seared outside with a softer texture inside, but it still had bite. The accompaniments made the dish: roasted tender turnips, spring peas (not as sweet I would expect for this time of year?), maitake mushrooms (love these!). This is definitely a must-get and doesn't feel like a vegetarian dish at all\n- Black cod: a close contender for the second favorite. The cod is super tender, but the highlight is this smoked bone broth underneath and the crouton that soaks up all the juice. The chard leaf it's wrapped in makes it a little harder to cut, but the stems were really nice in the broth below. Definitely eat this one with a spoon and don't miss this dish\n- Pork shoulder: a little richer and a little more standard in flavors, but the smooth new potato, rhubarb, and grilled broccoli were nice\n- Dry age beef: medium rare and sliced, so it's easy to share. The beef texture was good, but flavor wasn't amazing. What was amazing, though, was the green farro and pioppini mushroom porridge underneath that had amazingly rich flavors and good texture (I usually do NOT like farro)\n\nDesserts:\n- Poached rhubarb: we debated over this but were curious. The rhubarb was diced up, cooked down a little, and tart in flavor. It sat on a white creamier thing underneath (forgot what it was) and was unique, but not sure I would order it again\n- Beet and cara cara orange cremeux: not everyone loves beets, but I actually really like the subtle beet flavor and smooth texture. Some people thought the beet was a little too strong, but the cara caras really help balance it out\n- Frozen chocolate: probably the favorite dessert. The center is like a frozen rectangle of chocolate ice cream or semifreddo, but the mandarin oranges, cocoa nib, and mostly, the basil, really make the dish.

Broccoli and pork belly was amazing. Hats off to the chef of Pigs Head Croquettes, as its mix of flavors will tickle your taste buds until the cows come home!\n\nFor dessert, I think we had a split opinion about it. I know I enjoyed trying something new, but we weren't sure if there were curry influences on that dish, not my partner's preference. By golly, I still liked it!\n\nIt was an enjoyable early-evening dinner for sure. Great service.
