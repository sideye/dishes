It's reputation clearly precedes it and after careful scrutiny on Yelp, a visit was clearly warranted. Also, it is a Michelin-star restaurant! Looking back, it was decent. It was good dim sum, stellar service, and a hefty price tag.\n\nThe menu showcases the same dim sum that you would expect. The steamed char siu bau was good with a very well-steamed, but not gummy bun with seasoned char siu pork that was well done. The fried wontons were still warm, but not excessively hot and had that crisp exterior that one desires. The taro dumplings were quite good, but could have used just another hit of salt, while the shrimp dumpling might have had just a tad too much.\n\nWho doesn't like Peking duck? Well, Yank Sing didn't disappoint with a very well executed duck set between the steamed bun and green onions and sauce. Their Shanghai dumpling were fantastic, however be careful with the hot soup! The balance of flavors with the broth and bits of meat were fantastic. Definitely a must-have when you go.\n\nService is stellar and the wait for items were never long. It was quite a different experience form the neighborhood spots where yelling becomes more common then service with a smile. It was quite refreshing to not have the teapot or water glasses go empty and have food arrive in a nice orchestration to fill our stomachs.\n\nPrice is on the tad higher side, however isn't insanely pricey.

Two little words that conjure up so many memories and emotions.  I've had dim sum at countless places since childhood.  I would like to think that I have a good handle on what good dim sum should taste like, but honestly, I don't think I've visited enough of the world to cast an 'expert' judgment.  My experiences have only been all over California.  Should be good enough though.  Seriously.  I've eaten a lot of dim sum.  A lot.\n\nI've had dim sum all over the SF Bay and the one thing I can be certain of is that I've never really had good dim sum in SF itself.  Not that I haven't tried to find a place--of the numerous places I've been in the city, I just haven't found one worth praising.  Well, it took me a while to get around to Yank Sing and I'm glad I was finally able to give it a go.\n\nYank Sing, looking past some of its peculiarities, delivers on some pretty tasty dim sum dishes.  The staples were all certainly there.  The flavor was mostly there.  Note that the restaurant definitely caters more toward a Western palate.  That shouldn't bother you unless you're a diehard traditionalist.  There are some subtle hints and also some not-so-subtle, brazen applications in their dish preparation.  One look across the dining room and adjoining atrium and I knew why--there's a great diversity of well-to-do patrons.  As such, the service was far better and friendlier than your average Chinese restaurant that only gets frequented by Chinese folks.\n\nI won't get into all of the dishes that we had, but know that they were pretty decent and  properly cooked. Some oddities: The Peking duck buns were abominable.  Too much fatty duck meat on the cut, skin nowhere near crispy enough. Shanghai dumplings, while tasty, certainly not worth writing home about.  While every other bay area Shanghai Dumpling place is certainly a D- or F, Yank Sing hits a good enough dough thickness to juice to meaty flavor ratio to earn a C. \n\nWhoa, I had a few double takes: there was a lot of stuff that I really wouldn't normally associate with dimsum: honey walnut prawns during dimsum?  Not seen before in my lifetime!  Grilled sea bass steaks?  Cabbage salad? Hmm.  I guess if it sells, it sells.  Being that I'm not exactly an authentic Asian guy myself, I can't be too hypocritical.\n\nAt the end of the day after all of the tea was consumed and all of the mile-high piles of steamer baskets and empty plates were taken away, we were stuffed and left with the bill.  The price was definitely high for dim sum.  Probably the most expensive dim sum I've had anywhere.  Was it worth it?  Sure.  For now it reigns as the top spot in the city for 'deem sum'.

So to honor this comeback I'd like to take this time to write about one of my fav. foods: dim sum at Yank Sing in SF.\n\nI came here just before lunch on Sat. I was initially thrown off by the huge banquet space of the Rincon Center but immediately found my way to toward the sights and sounds of the bustling restaurant. It was much bigger than I thought. This place was no hole-in-the-wall, which I'm typically accustomed to. Servers pushing their carts like NYC cab drivers, not caring who's in their way, and the smell of fresh dim sum in the air. This was no dim sum restaurant at all. No, no. This was heaven.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I don't remember half the names of the items. There was hella dim sum that before I knew it, I lost track of what it was I devoured. But thank God to online menus. Here's what I liked: the Shanghai dumpling with its contents of pork and savory broth. The Mandarin dumplings were alright, just needed some soy sauce to moisten it up. The soft shell crab, seasoned with salt and pepper then deep fried, was a nice touch. For my fellow San Franciscans, ever heard of bacon wrapped hot dogs? Well then try the bacon wrapped shrimp. The stuff's so good it would make Bubba cry. Other things worth trying were the Sea Bass and the walnut shrimp. But the one item worth savoring (and ordering to go) was the Steamed pork bun. Seriously, take a moment to truly enjoy this mouth-watering, honey-glazed, warm and fluffy bun, stuffed with sweet bits of pork. It's amazing! \n\nDrooling yet?\n\nI bet you are. This place very much accommodates small-large parties. Great for families. It's clean. Though it is a big restaurant, it's still seems like tight quarters. So get to know your neighbors. You'll be there for a while if you're satisfied with the food.\n\nOther things to note: the service is good but I can see how busy it can get. And what's cool is they also validate parking (You're welcome). And if you're in a rush, you can order-to-go just outside the restaurant. \n\nSo if you're craving dim sum, hit this place up.

You would think the Rincon Center would be the sole bastion of the white collar drone, but somehow the anti-contraceptive-using families of tourists find it and take control of the bigger tables.

The emphasis on \"weekend\" is important because weekday dim sum here involves more or less the same high quality, well crafted dim sum dishes but it is served at a frenetic Financial District pace and service sometimes suffers.  To beat the perennial line here, it's best to arrive by 11 am, otherwise you may face an hour-long wait.  \n\nYank Sing provides excellent renditions of the dim sum classics and largely avoids sacrificing authenticity of these dishes for the unfamiliar palate, though it also serves a few spotty dim sum dishes (e.g., the gailan, Chinese broccoli is too chilled for my liking, and is cooked in such that it minimizes the vegetable's natural bitterness).  Of course, there are plenty of highlights.\n\nFor starters, we enjoy pairing a combination of Pu-erh/Chrysanthemum tea with the meal.  Yank Sing's version is authentically smooth and slightly sweet.  \n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings are also generally good, though a little too dry (lacking in the eponymous soup) on a recent weekday visit.  \n\nThe Mandarin dumplings with chives -- fresh chives, cilantro, and shrimp stuffed in translucent rice flour wrappers -- are delicious and not commonly found in the triangle shape that Yank Sing has adopted.  \n\nThe shrimp dumpling (\"ha gau\"), a classic dim sum item, is quite good here.  These bite size dumplings have chopped shrimp embedded with crunchy bamboo shoot in a bite-size.\n\nThe pork siu mye, another classic dim sum dish, is also generally very good.  It features chopped shrimp with pork, shiitake mushrooms filling wrapped formed into a fluted \"basket\" with wonton wrappers.\n\nThe house-roasted Peking duck, served as an appetizer, is also good, but those who love Peking duck will be disappointed by the high cost to portion ratio.  This dish features crispy honey-coated duck skin and tender slices of duck stuffed in a steamed seashell bun, and served with slivered scallions and tangy hoisin sauce.\n\nThe steamed pork buns, another classic dim sum item, is also tasty, though not the best I've ever had.  These fluffy steamed buns are stuffed with honey-glazed BBQ pork.  These are often a hit with little ones.  \n\nTo finish off a dim sum lunch here, we like to get Yank Sing's bite size egg custard tarts, which combine flaky crust with a delicate egg custard interior.

I love dim sum but sometimes it is one of the more stressful of dining experiences.

Sometimes said server gets annoyed and rudely leaves after you just end up saying no the cart offerings. All that being said I had a hella good time at Yank Sing!\n\nThis was recommended by a cousin as one of her favorite places and considering she is an SF local we said sure despite the average star rating on Yelp. I think one of the major reasons people complain is that it's \"lack of authenticity.\" It's not located in Chinatown but in the Financial District. As such it caters to the business crowds. You won't get the \"Chinatown\" feel with a lot of power suits around you and the lack of Chinese families waiting for a table.

Total bill for a party of 6 was $280. However this was basically our breakfast and lunch having flown in that morning at 9:00 and doing some touristy stuff to almost 1:30. In other words we were starving. \n\nHighlight dish was the honey grilled sea bass. I loved it. Tender flesh with a slightly sweet sauce with just enough char from the grill. Now I need to mention. Neither of my kids like cooked fish. I've tried frying, grilling, baking. At other restaurants they totally turn a blind eye to fish unless oddly enough if it is raw. But my bold one decided to take a bite of the sea bass dish. We ended up ordering two more plates which for sure pushed the bill but was worth every cent to see her enjoying a new discovery. There was also a second preparation of the sea bass as, wait for it, salt and f-ing pepper sea bass. We just flat out ordered two of those without hesitation. Both sea bass were so good I'm tearing up. \n\nDeep fried claw crabs were a hit. My sister's one request in this trip was crab. Her exact words were \"I'm in heaven.\" \n\nPan fried Turnip cake was superb. Moist yet not too soggy with ample amounts of Chinese sausage mixed in giving an almost bacon taste. \n\nXLB were done right.

Even if you told a server no thanks, they graciously thanked you with a smile. I also noticed the English spoken was pretty clear, again a by-product if location. They were also very efficient, if you asked a server for a dish they weren't responsible for they had little microphones that they spoke into to direct the correct server your way!

She then went on herself for a minute or two and finally admitted herself that she was just forgotten to bring it out from the kitchen.  So she said she had to go get it from the kitchen (in a pissed-off tone).  I was like okay.  I'd just do without the sauce then.  But then she asked me if that meant I would want her to get it from the kitchen.  Ok, wait a minute.  Is this a trick question? Does that mean I should get up to go the kitchen to get it myself?  Hey but I don't work here.  How could one simply ordering a dish became so complicated?\nOkay.  No big deal.  People could have off-days on job.  So I decided to move on without THE sauce.  She came back with the sauce herself a while later eventually, remarking \"here is your sauce!\"  loudly.  The whole scene made me feel very uncomfortable as if I was being an as***le to her, which I didn't.  \n\nOther stuff.\nParking was confusing and tough.  People were fighting for parking downstairs.  There were cussing and f-bombs.  Valet or no valet parking was the question. Then, waiting and seeing no one to go to for picking up your car afterwards.  \nPrice wise, the whole experience was pricey like I remembered, but it's not worthy to come here anymore.  Our bill with tips was about $100 for seven items for 2 people.  I am very sensitive to MSG.  This meal made me very sleepy afterwards because of the MSG.  \n\nConclusion: \nMy memory for this place is now full of disappointments, confusion, complication, and lies (about a sauce).  And I don't like being lied to. \n\nSeems like this place caters to Saleforce people and tourists only.  Enjoy your meal here if you're either.  If you're neither, stay away.\n\nOne star for the clean environment.

They have carts here so you can do it the right way and order from those, or if you're more comfortable ordering from a menu and waiter, that's an option too.\n\nMost of the dishes were pretty standard, but there were a few that I especially enjoyed more:\n* Baked BBQ Pork Bun ($7.35 for 3) - delicious bbq pork filling and super fluffy, slightly sweet bun\n* Shanghai Kurobuta Pork Dumpling / Xiao Long Bao ($14 for 6) - relatively thin skin that holds the dumpling well, lots of soup\n* Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai ($7.35 for 4) - very tender and flavorful\n* Egg Custard Tart ($12.05 for 4) - incredibly silky custard; flaky tart\n\nWe also ordered:\n* Steamed Rice Noodle Rolls ($9.15 for 3)\n* Steamed Spareribs ($5.65)\n* Shrimp & Chive Dumplings ($6.15 for 3)\n* Shrimp Dumplings ($7.35 for 4)\n* Peking Duck ($6.75 for 1 piece) - ridiculously expensive for 1 piece of duck and 1 bao, but at least the duck was good\n* Turnip Cake ($5.65 for 3)\n* Snap Peas in Chili Sauce ($7.35)\n* Sauteed String Beans ($9.15)\n* Honey Walnut Prawn ($13.55 for 6)\n* Honey Glazed Walnut Salad ($12.05) - not something I've seen at dim sum before.

In recent years, they've received a lot of notable press, especially regarding their \"xiao long bao\" or soup dumplings that Patricia Unterman raved about.\n\nTheir Rincon Center location (off Spear Street) is definitely their flagship and very popular with tourists.  The glass open-aired building with the indoor waterfall is impressive and Yank Sing is the epicenter of activity here.\n\nWe put down our name and only had to wait for about 15 minutes.  With plentiful tables both in the atrium and inside the main restaurant, the turnover appears quick.\n\nMultiple food carts soon passed by and I was thrilled when the first food cart was their famed soup dumplings.  Truth be told, they are well aware of the positive press as that cart would pass by our table at least five more times throughout our meal.  Our dim sum: \n\nHar Gow \nChives dumpling \nDumpling #3 (tasted similar to first 2)\nFried taro \nDeep Fried Crab Claw \nFried shrimp \nBacon wrapped shrimp with green onion  \nXiao long bao\nPeking Duck\n\nOverall, we found the items at Yank Sing to be solid, with an occasional one that was excellent.  The xiao long bao, in particular,  deserves the rave reviews.  It was close to perfect and the thin skin is extremely hard to find in the Bay Area.  As well, it had a soup quantity that puts most dumpling places to shame.  \n\nThe crab claw was excellent as well.  Lots of fresh crab meat and a nice crispy fried exterior.  \n\nOther than those two items, I thought everything was similar to what I'd find at other recommended dim sum places: Cityview (SF), Koi Palace (Daly City), Hong Kong Saigon (Sunnyvale), ABC Seafood (Foster City) or Joy Luck (Cupertino).\n\nThe real shocker of the meal came when I decided to ask how much an order of Peking Duck would cost.  The server comes to your table and asks how many slices you would like.  Little did I know, each SLICE of peking duck costs $5.40.  Are you kidding me????  How much is the entire duck?????  $100!?!  \n\nOnce I realized how pricey this item was, I perused the menu for other prices of dim sum items: \n\nA slice of honey glazed seabass (dim sum portion) -  $18!  Are you serious!?!?  How much does the entire fish cost?  $300?!?!?  \n\nThe famed xiao long bao -  ~$12 for 6 dumplings!  For reference, the more famous Din Tai Fung averages $7-9/order and they sell a truffle xiao long bao (available only overseas) that costs about $14/order.  Yank Sing may be among the better xiao long bao I've had in the Bay Area, but the price premium definitely changes my rating.  \n\nThe final sticker shock, of course, came with the total bill.  For 3 people, our bill was easily north of $100.  For lunch and simple dim sum.  We didn't have lobster.  We didn't have abalone or high end seafood.  Heck, the xiao long bao isn't even the crab meat versions many restaurants have.  With so many other options in SF and beyond, I can't justify those prices for dim sum. \n\nThe service for such a pricey establishment isn't particularly stellar either.  We had to flag down waiters to remove our empty plates and bamboo steamers and after we asked for the bill and gave our credit card, the whole transaction seemed like it took 15+ minutes, even though the lunch crowds had clearly died down with the late hour.  \n\nTake home message: Yank Sing is pretty good, but those prices are ludicrous.  Call it the tourist tax; foreigner fee; hype pricing; marketing premium.....just please don't call it a fair value.

As expected of an authentic dim sum restaurant, the food was prepared very well across the board. My favorites were their home-made Shanghai dumplings and the cheong fun (rice noodles, shrimp, and soy sauce). For dessert, the sesame balls and mango pudding rounded out my meal perfectly.\n\nService:\nAgain, relatively good. Since we came in on the 4th of July, there was certainly a large population of customers in the restaurant; however, the food was still promptly served to each table, and it doesn't take long to try all the dishes that you want. One of the most impressive points of notice was how coordinated the servers were. When one member of my party ordered something that the cart was out of, the server immediately phoned a different cart and smoothly presented the missing dish. Although most of the servers don't speak fluent English, they genuinely try to be attentive and helpful in any way they can.\n\nPricing:\nAs you would expect in San Francisco, the food is extremely expensive. Dishes run between an understandable $5 and a ludicrous $21 (for the sea bass). Most of the dishes are also relatively small, further compounding the costliness of the restaurant. We spent $30+ for 5 thin pieces of Peking duck, whereas a whole duck would be cheaper at other places. As good as the food is, I am still unsure as to whether or not it warrants the price. This is by far the main flaw of the restaurant and keeps it from attaining higher marks.\n\nOverall Experience:\nAll in all, Yank Sing is truly a great dim sum restaurant for the Bay Area that offers an authentic taste of Asian appetizer style dishes.

My experiences have only been all over California.  Should be good enough though.  Seriously.  I've eaten a lot of dim sum.  A lot.\n\nI've had dim sum all over the SF Bay and the one thing I can be certain of is that I've never really had good dim sum in SF itself.

Well, it took me a while to get around to Yank Sing and I'm glad I was finally able to give it a go.\n\nYank Sing, looking past some of its peculiarities, delivers on some pretty tasty dim sum dishes.  The staples were all certainly there.  The flavor was mostly there.  Note that the restaurant definitely caters more toward a Western palate.  That shouldn't bother you unless you're a diehard traditionalist.  There are some subtle hints and also some not-so-subtle, brazen applications in their dish preparation.  One look across the dining room and adjoining atrium and I knew why--there's a great diversity of well-to-do patrons.

Some oddities: The Peking duck buns were abominable.  Too much fatty duck meat on the cut, skin nowhere near crispy enough. Shanghai dumplings, while tasty, certainly not worth writing home about.

Not seen before in my lifetime!  Grilled sea bass steaks?  Cabbage salad? Hmm.  I guess if it sells, it sells.  Being that I'm not exactly an authentic Asian guy myself, I can't be too hypocritical.\n\nAt the end of the day after all of the tea was consumed and all of the mile-high piles of steamer baskets and empty plates were taken away, we were stuffed and left with the bill.

"], "author": "Chris T.", "review": "Yank Sing is a great spot for traditional weekend dim sum for seasoned and rookie dim sum (or \"deem sum\") diners alike.  The emphasis on \"weekend\" is important because weekday dim sum here involves more or less the same high quality, well crafted dim sum dishes but it is served at a frenetic Financial District pace and service sometimes suffers.  To beat the perennial line here, it's best to arrive by 11 am, otherwise you may face an hour-long wait.  \n\nYank Sing provides excellent renditions of the dim sum classics and largely avoids sacrificing authenticity of these dishes for the unfamiliar palate, though it also serves a few spotty dim sum dishes (e.g., the gailan, Chinese broccoli is too chilled for my liking, and is cooked in such that it minimizes the vegetable's natural bitterness).  Of course, there are plenty of highlights.\n\nFor starters, we enjoy pairing a combination of Pu-erh/Chrysanthemum tea with the meal.  Yank Sing's version is authentically smooth and slightly sweet.  \n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings are also generally good, though a little too dry (lacking in the eponymous soup) on a recent weekday visit.  \n\nThe Mandarin dumplings with chives -- fresh chives, cilantro, and shrimp stuffed in translucent rice flour wrappers -- are delicious and not commonly found in the triangle shape that Yank Sing has adopted.  \n\nThe shrimp dumpling (\"ha gau\"), a classic dim sum item, is quite good here.  These bite size dumplings have chopped shrimp embedded with crunchy bamboo shoot in a bite-size.\n\nThe pork siu mye, another classic dim sum dish, is also generally very good.  It features chopped shrimp with pork, shiitake mushrooms filling wrapped formed into a fluted \"basket\" with wonton wrappers.\n\nThe house-roasted Peking duck, served as an appetizer, is also good, but those who love Peking duck will be disappointed by the high cost to portion ratio.  This dish features crispy honey-coated duck skin and tender slices of duck stuffed in a steamed seashell bun, and served with slivered scallions and tangy hoisin sauce.\n\nThe steamed pork buns, another classic dim sum item, is also tasty, though not the best I've ever had.  These fluffy steamed buns are stuffed with honey-glazed BBQ pork.  These are often a hit with little ones.  \n\nTo finish off a dim sum lunch here, we like to get Yank Sing's bite size egg custard tarts, which combine flaky crust with a delicate egg custard interior.  Yank Sing's egg tarts are up there with Golden Gate Bakery's.    \n\nService is generally responsive and friendly, and the venue is spotless.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Honey walnut shrimp, potstickers, XLB, Peking duck, chow fun, and Don-taut- ", "all excellent.

Most other dimsum places don't serve expensive fish, they serve lots of fried stuff or stuff wrapped in rice based products, so is it that hard to figure out why they are cheaper?\n\nc) They place no value on service or quality of dining experience - yes I can get food that is almost as good for half as much, but do I enjoy chasing carts, waiting 20 minutes for tea and water, and having to grovel to get the bill? This is more food double standard going on here, if you were treated like that at a French/Italian restaurant you'd be pissed to pay even $15 for it.\n\nd) They have never been to a real Chinese dimsum place - waiting is normal - if there's no wait, it's usually bad.

Yang Sing version was the Chinese version of piggy in a blanket, except the blanket is for the harsh Siberia winter! The poor piggy is most probably suffocating in the blankie. If I wanted to eat dough, I will just go buy some SF Sourdough bread and be happier eating that. A hallmark for this Shanghai delicacy is that the dumpling form a pear shape when pick up with the chopsticks, when is the laying flat in the steam basket, the centre of the dumpling is surrounded by a brothy perimeter within the dough, and as you pick it up, the broth moved to the bottom, if it breaks, it's bad craftsmanship, My late father would have tossed it away and send it back. Also you can count the folds, which should be about 18. I will have no problem if this is just one of Yank sing regular item for $8 pr $9, for this to be a signature item, it failed miserably!

Or have you been lately?  This is the best Dimsum we have had in the US. Yes I have had Dimsum in Kong Kong. My issue with those comparing it to Kong Kong is that there is not just one style of restaurant or even just one style of Dimsum in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has every type of restaurant ad every type of Dimsum the states has and more. Having said all of that Yank Sing was far better on every level in every way than any Dimsum I have had in NYC. I actually do not review them (NYC Dimsum restaurants)  they are so bad. Their menus are limited and they are all pretty filthy and with a life threatening shell fish allergy I have found that NYC Dimsum puts me in danger every time! I ask if there is shell fish and they always say no in NYC. My husband even asks in Chinese so it is not a language barrier. And no I am not allergic to all sea food. I got nasty message from some weirdo here at Yelp saying if you are allergic to seafood blah blah blah... I am not allergic to sea food and eat Seafood more than any other cuisine. I am just allergic to shrimp. And I wasn't always. It is a relatively new allergy. But I digress...\nYank Sing was clean, the service was good, and the food was good. But what I liked about it the most is the menu was very extensive. I have been to all of the top Dimsum in NYC and we have NOTHING like Yank Sing in the 5 boroughs. The closest I have had to Yank Sing was in Hong Kong which is why I am mentioning Hong Kong. I do not think most of those who are mentioning Hong Kong have actually been there. Hong Kong has some cutting edge restaurants. Some are dirty like here in NYC and some are very stylish and clean which we do not have here in NY not for Dimsum. Some are like Yank Sing in Hong Kong   and some are very Americanized for tourists and some are old school. There isn't one style of Dimsum in Hong Kong. So having said all of that it is the closest to what I have had in Hong Kong. We had Dimsum at several restaurants in Hong Kong.\nYank Sing got the James Beard award and is also in the Michelin guide. It was also voted one of the top Chinese restaurants in the US. http://top100.chinesemenu.com/event/2010/en/winner.asp\nMy Chinese husband liked it a lot! He is hard to please as far as Chinese food goes because he cooks it better than any restaurant we have been to in the US. He said the thing he liked about it the most was that it seemed more like an authentic Dimsum \"experience\" than any Dimsum restaurant in NYC,  he explained that in NYC they rush you and most restaurants here are rude and dirty. He said the presentation at Yank Sing  is more professional and more like what we had in Hong Kong.\nAt Yank Sing the experience itself seemed to be more like what we have experienced in Hong Kong. If and when we go to San Fransisco again we would love to go back and try it again. Some say it has changed. It is worth a visit to find out.\nThe thing about having Dimsum in San Fransisco that is different than NYC is it seems everyone has Dimsum. It seems to be a part of the culture there. \nAlso all of the servers spoke Cantonese unlike  Ton Kiang where they did not speak Cantonese. http://www.yelp.com/biz/ton-kiang-san-francisco#hrid:-ZcurFux6rQdaxisRB_Pug/src:self\nMy favorite part of the meal was the Peking Duck. \nThe only real down side was the price.

However, $10.90 for 6 pieces of xiao long bao??? (Shanghai steamed dumplings) $8.70 for an order of cong you bing??? (scallion pancakes) My mom and I ordered 10 items and the bill was over $100!!!

I've given up on finding amazing xiaolongbao...I've long come to the (jaded) conclusion that only Joe's Shanghai could make amazing xiaolongbao.

"], "author": "Heathcliff D.", "review": "In an area of the US where there is an abundance of Chinese from Hong Kong and Guangzhou, one would think that there are a lot of great choices for dim sum.  This unfortunately is not the case.  In a lengthy discussion with one of the best Chinese chefs in the US, Joe Ng (Chinatown Brasserie, Red Farm), most of the dim sum tea houses have people working for them that are too tired to prepare the dough the way it needs to be done.  It takes strength and vigor to make dim sum skin paper thin and the stuffing either nice and tight or juicy and flavorful.\n\nYank Sing is among the best in Northern California but still falls a little short of what the ideal should be.  This is one reason for just four starts.  While time tested for many years (10+), refreshing the menu would be helpful.  It is by far better than the Chinatown tea houses and better than the over rated Koi Palace.  Once the name James Beard rolls around or Michelin, then things must be absolutely divine, which this is not.  It's good dim sum, maybe arguably very good dim sum.  But it is not great dim sum.  Have it once, and perhaps to the less traveled dim sum hobbyist, it is great.  But have it the 4th or 5th time, and things get a little tiring.  Don't get me wrong...we went their at 10am and bought some extra to take home.  Sometimes, we even travel across the bridge just to get a bite to-go or even catch some to-go before having to catch a cross country flight.  But 5 stars this is not.  It's a solid four stars.\n\nAlmost everything steamed is very good.  For health reasons, we seldom eat anything fried unless it is a must have (like Hana's tempura or age dashi tofu); however, in the past, the deep fried crab and prawn dish has been very nice to have.  The XLB is probably the best that one can get in Northern California (look out for the upcoming review on the best XLB in the country).  What's an honorable mention for Yank Sing are the other, non-traditional dim sum items available (sea bass, Peking duck, lettuce wrap chicken).  Some of these items are nice to have.  Another very nice offering is the selection of teas.\n\nOne thought for some of the other posts:  quit complaining about the cost.  You pay for what you get for.  If you're looking for high quality dim sum, it isn't going to come at a cheap price.  If you're looking for cheap and large in quantity, go to Chinatown and eat that garbage.  Remember, high quality dim sum will have translucent skin with a) lots of juice inside (like xlb), b) firm texture (like shrimp dumplings...aka ha gow), or c) lots of flavor without an msg aftertaste (like Yank Sing's pea sprout dumplings).  \n\nMy suggestion to the readers, go early and grab a table.  One of my favorite times has been to take an early morning hike and then heading over for a 10am brunch.  Good times.  Good restaurant.  Good eats.\n\nH", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-11-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Some of my favourite must-have here are shrimp dumpling (allergy, the hell with ya), scallop dumpling, sticky rice, chicken porridge, peking duck and of course their Shanghai dumpling..which you can't really order it to go unless you order extra on the side then decide that you can't finish it....long story, but I had to do this trick when I wanted to take some to go.

"], "author": "MICHAEL AND VERNA M.", "review": "We have enjoyed the dim sum here for lunch a few times and this week we were in the mood for something different than our usual lunch spots.\nLet me start with 2 notes:\nFor those that say the restaurant is pricey, you know that before you go if you look at the reviews/menus online. And you are in SF...this isn't Panda Express.\nService being aggressive....the dim sum service ( or service in any traditional Chinese restaurant)..can be aggressive...there are millions of mouths to feed in that country.  But service can be aggressive anywhere. You have a mouth, speak up and politely slow down the service if you want to relax and dine at a leisurely pace.\n\nWe enjoyed the ha gau (shrimp dumplings....2 orders) as we always do. Huge, suculent portions of shrimp lightly seasoned in a paper thin wrapper served steaming hot. The seafood basil dumplings not quite as good a bit bland.  The sea bass in honey soy sauce was outstanding..a huge, flakey, moist chuck of pure white sea bass in a very light honey soy sauce. Nothing masked the delicious flavor of the fish. Our favorite dish of the afternoon. My husband enjoyed the Peking duck....me not. Hence, 1 star off for the duck....my opinion and taste buds. The only Peking duck on earth I have ever loved and devoured was in Beijing. I felt this was gamey and a bit greasy, yet overcooked and the buns were dry and flavorless. However, eggplant being one of my very favorite veggies...the eggplant with hunan sauce was excellent. Not sweet or cloying, not processed blood red sauce, light, nicely dressed and steaming hot, fresh made and brought to the table. Definitely enough food for a satisfying lunch. Agreement on the tea pot.....puddles are formed on the table at each pouring, but the tea is very tasty. The table cloth and napkins also concur with regard to the tea.\n\nParking is not easy anywhere in SF, a part of the dining adventure. A cheap eat, not, but how often do you wake up and say....let's have good dim sum....not every day or even every week. So when you have the craving, need your dim sum fix, this is an excellent place to satisfy the palate in a nice room with efficient and pleasant service.  And it is still cheaper than a ticket to China.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-02-26"}, {"excerpts": ["They serve Peking Duck by the slice, which is a nice way to try it.

The only problem is that I don't eat seafood or fish of any kind (I'm not allergic, but I just don't like it) and at most dim sum places I've been to that makes it hard to enjoy my meal. I've been to several dim sum places around the bay area and Yank Sing is by far my favorite. With other dim sum places I've tried, there would only be 2 or 3 non-dessert items that I could even eat, and while I could see that my seafood-loving dining companions were enjoying themselves, the quality of the dishes I got was mediocre.\n\nYank Sing is the only dim sum place I've found (in the bay area) that has a terrific selection of creative dishes that don't have seafood (there are good vegetarian options also). For this I am happy to pay more, and I usually do, because Yank Sing can get expensive: For a full dim sum lunch we usually pay about $20 a person and sometimes more. The bill is in Chinese so unless you can read Chinese you won't be able to figure out which items cost what, which can be confusing. Most of the regular items cost between $2.50 and $4 but some specials (xiao long bao for example) can cost $6-7. Also, sometimes you will ask for an item from a cart and they'll hand you the plate but what they don't tell you is that what they've given you is actually a \"double order\" (this almost always happens with spring rolls) so you're actually charged twice as much as a regular item. If you like Yank Sing but think it's too expensive the best thing to do is decide in advance what you want to get  and stick to it - avoid impulse shopping! Another way to enjoy Yank Sing food on the cheap is the Yank Sing 2 Go lunch specials on weekdays.\n\nMy absolute favorite here are the chicken mushroom dumplings - they have perfect translucent wrappers and a delicious filling (water chestnuts and snow peas giving it a slight crunch). Other favorites include green onion cakes with peanut sauce, xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings, which i think of as 'the ship in a bottle of chinese cooking'), sweet rice dumplings, shitake mushroom dumplings, spring rolls and pork buns. They serve Peking Duck by the slice, which is a nice way to try it. They have a lot of dessert choices - the coconut rolls are great. I've also enjoyed the custard tarts and sesame balls.

Worst of the bunch were the crab cakes, which had a slightly hard exterior and just no oomph in the flavor.  \n\nService:  4 stars.  The servers are really attentive here and call out the dim sum in English (the majority of the clientele is non-Asian).  They're also helpful in getting you items that you're not seeing on the carts passing by.  We had to do that for our dessert (sesame balls and custard tarts), which was cool because our server gave us the option of ordering just 2 pieces of each.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.

The restaurant even proudly displays their health code score of 100 because it's probably the only Chinese restaurant in the country that did so well.  I just love the dim sum carts  (I've been trying to get one of my friends to push a cart and dress like a dim sum wench for Halloween for years).  So many of the smaller places don't have them.  It's nice to see what you're getting before you order.  Also, the waitstaff here isn't as aggressive as at many other places.  Honestly, how many times do I have to say no to chicken feet!  They also have a huge variety, including some higher-end non-traditional dishes like the deep-fried soft-shell crab.  I also really like the deep-fried crab claw.  I typically focus on the seafood stuff, like various shrimp dumplings but pretty much everything I've had has been good.  It's also nice that they offer peking duck by the slice.

When I read that Yank Sing had the best dim sum in town I decided that was where I'd get my indoctrination.  I'm nowhere close to being an aficionado that can declare Yank Sing the best, but it was pretty darn good and a memorable experience.

I had to repeat that to my server to make sure I'd heard it correctly.  Soup in a dumpling?  I gingerly loaded one onto a spoon, drizzled it with red sauce and slurped it into my mouth.  Wow, what an intoxicatingly delicious treat.  Despite eating alone I had no trouble enjoying all six dumplings by myself!  It was one of the highlights of my meal.  \n\nAnother highlight was the honey glazed Sea Bass, at $28 the most expensive item on the menu.  Don't let that scare you away.  It's tender and delicious and it's large enough to provide an entr\u00e9e size portion for three people.  So worth it.    \n\nI also sampled chicken satay.  Mine were tender and tasty, but a familiar item that didn't deliver the excitement of my dumplings.  Steamed pork buns were fluffy and stuffed with steaming honey glazed bbq pork, an appealing item to a Southern boy.

To beat the perennial line here, it's best to arrive by 11 am, otherwise you may face an hour-long wait.  \n\nYank Sing provides excellent renditions of the dim sum classics and largely avoids sacrificing authenticity of these dishes for the unfamiliar palate, though it also serves a few spotty dim sum dishes (e.g., the gailan, Chinese broccoli is too chilled for my liking, and is cooked in such that it minimizes the vegetable's natural bitterness).  Of course, there are plenty of highlights.\n\nFor starters, we enjoy pairing a combination of Pu-erh/Chrysanthemum tea with the meal.  Yank Sing's version is authentically smooth and slightly sweet.  \n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings are also generally good, though a little too dry (lacking in the eponymous soup) on a recent weekday visit.  \n\nThe Mandarin dumplings with chives -- fresh chives, cilantro, and shrimp stuffed in translucent rice flour wrappers -- are delicious and not commonly found in the triangle shape that Yank Sing has adopted.  \n\nThe shrimp dumpling (\"ha gau\"), a classic dim sum item, is quite good here.

It features chopped shrimp with pork, shiitake mushrooms filling wrapped formed into a fluted \"basket\" with wonton wrappers.\n\nThe house-roasted Peking duck, served as an appetizer, is also good, but those who love Peking duck will be disappointed by the high cost to portion ratio.  This dish features crispy honey-coated duck skin and tender slices of duck stuffed in a steamed seashell bun, and served with slivered scallions and tangy hoisin sauce.\n\nThe steamed pork buns, another classic dim sum item, is also tasty, though not the best I've ever had.  These fluffy steamed buns are stuffed with honey-glazed BBQ pork.  These are often a hit with little ones.  \n\nTo finish off a dim sum lunch here, we like to get Yank Sing's bite size egg custard tarts, which combine flaky crust with a delicate egg custard interior.

One of our dining companions only eats gluten-free foods, so there were a few items that she ordered that I didn't get a chance to taste. \n\nThe two of us non-gluten free people started with an order of pork pot-stickers and chicken egg rolls. They weren't bad, but they were probably my two least favorite things that we had. These were the only two non-steamed items that we had, and I'm thinking it's because of this they didn't taste as fresh as some of the other items we ordered (they were a little greasy). \n\nThe first two steamed items that we tried were the shrimp dumplings, which were awesome (they were basically all shrimp) and the Sui Mai? (I think that's what those pork dumplings are called?), and they were delicious! We also had two orders of the the steamed pork buns, which were highly recommended by one of our dining companions, and they did not disappoint. We also has the Shanghai dumplings (those soup dumpling things), which were great (these seem to be a popular item here). \n\nOur gluten free companion had some sort of leaf-wrapped rice patty thing that actually looked really good as well as the mushroom/chicken dumplings (I guess whatever they use as the \"dumpling\" with this item is gluten free). \n\nFor dessert we had mango pudding as well these sesame apricot ball things, which were both delicious! I'm not sure what kind of tea we had (it wasn't the jasmine), but it was good as well. \n\nSince I was a dim sum virgin, it's kind of hard for me rate the service since dim sum service works a little differently than a restaurant where you would order off a menu. However, the carts came around often and all the servers seemed to know the dishes pretty well. At times they can be a little pushy (they'll start to put plates down on your table before you say whether or not you want it) and it did take us a few tries to get the mushroom/chicken dumplings (this was the only item we specifically requested). \n\nI see where a lot of people say this place is expensive, and it definitely is a little pricey, but I thought it was worth the price for everything we ate. With tax and tip each of us in our group paid about $30 and we ate a LOT of food!!! \n\nI would definitely come back here for dim sum, especially with a large group for brunch or birthday.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Baked Pork Buns & Steamed Pork Buns.

Let's get right down to it, as here is sincerely is ALL about the food, glorious food. \n\nBroccoli. Plain, fresh and perfectly palette cleansing between more savory dishes.

Pork Buns as we all know them, are the steamed with the lovely chewy outer, the succulent, pork and sweet/sour inner. These, of course are the best you will ever have of a pork bun. Not at ALL skimpy on the filling and, like everything here, a clean, good flavor. Baked Buns are something I have never seen anywhere else, and having seen them on The Food Network's Best Pork Thing I Ever Ate, I had to try this Brother to the Steamed Bun. A little honey outside, and the same great inside. The baking dries the dough a little more and you miss that chewy perfect texture, so I am going to say - if you only get ONE bun, make it the steamed. \n\nRoast Duck with Pancake. This is SUCH an unassuming dish, but truly wonderful. The same pork bun dough in a tiny little pancake form that you stuff with your slice of duck, top with shaved onion and gorgeous hoisin. This was simple as could be, but excellent all around. \n\nHoney Walnut Prawns. Delectable, sweet and fresh fresh prawns in the slightest lobster sauce with toasty, crunchy, beautiful walnuts. So, so very good. \n\nRed Cabbage Salad. This is the first thing they will ask you if you would like. It doesn't at all look like much, but this was one unassuming dish I could NOT get enough of. So crunchy, a bit citrusy, a bit sweet and a LOT great with cilantro and fennel and more of those lovely walnuts. Yum. \n\nNow, don't think we forgot about those famous Soup Dumplings. Us newcomers were instant fans and Brat I, Miss Knower of All Things Wonderful, sat and nodded knowingly. These are not to be missed, and 2 orders right away are not frowned upon. \n\nBUT, the BEST thing - of all these honestly perfect dishes is the Sesame Balls. Coated in toasted sesames, delightfully crunchy outside and so so wickedly chewy inside and then a little dollop of sweet paste, these are definitely one of the best things I have ever had the joy of eating. Forget the damn Lucky Charms- THESE are Magically Delicious.\n\nYes, Yank Sing is pricey. But paying for great food that you know is clean, fresh, nothing funny going on with the ingredients and leaves you feeling uplifted and not greasy gross - done. \n\nYes, I dare say, Yank Sing will inspire you to...Sing!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-03-31"}, {"excerpts": ["We also tried the steamed pork buns, my second favorite item, and baked bbq pork buns.

I spent a significant portion of my life consuming soup dumplings, I can assure you. These were so excellent -- so much soup, and wonderfully tender meat filling inside. I only wish they served black vinegar instead of that red stuff. \n\nThe Peking duck was very disappointing, unfortunately. I was excited to have the opportunity to order an individual portion of Peking duck, as I rarely have reason to order an entire duck. But god....the duck was awful! The meat was gray, and there was none of the crispy skin that is really the absolute essence of Peking duck. I did, however, appreciate the very fluffy steamed buns. \n\nThe steamed pork buns were good, but oversized.

The toast was pleasantly crunchy and greasy, but the huge balled up shrimp was a bit overwhelming after awhile. \n\nThe next time I'm here (and I will be, for the soup dumplings if nothing else), I want to try the snow pea shoot dumplings, the curry chicken turnovers, and fish (forget what kind it is, but looked beautiful). I really do like the variety of dim sum offered at Yank Sing. \n\nUltimately, I truly could not get over the prices. I suppose it is unfair to think it's ridiculous to pay so much for dim sum...not all ethnic food should automatically be considered as cheap food and I think higher prices for high quality food could really do a lot to improve the reputation of Chinese food.

Wow, what an intoxicatingly delicious treat.  Despite eating alone I had no trouble enjoying all six dumplings by myself!  It was one of the highlights of my meal.  \n\nAnother highlight was the honey glazed Sea Bass, at $28 the most expensive item on the menu.  Don't let that scare you away.

All the dumplings are great and have great texture, but the savory vegetable one stands above all. It is full of flavor, but not too spicy. I'd recommend not dipping it with any soy sauce or mustard that they give on the side because then you might miss the flavor. I also really enjoyed the mushroom dumplings - they are not as flavorful but the mushrooms are extremely juicy and still taste great. The spinach and pea dumplings are good too, but not as tasty (although they are a bit healthier). I would recommend dipping them in a little soy sauce or mustard. We also ordered the silken tofu and although I'm not a huge fan of eating tofu straight up, this tofu was extremely good. It was very soft and went down smoothly. The sauce that the tofu was in was extremely delicious - very savory, but not too spicy. It also didn't feel too oily.

I thought I was getting a plate of duck but instead received a single bao bun which I don't care for.  It was very mainstream and came with the traditional sauce and veggies.  \n\nMushroom Dumpling - $6.35, 3-pieces.  The server said they were shrimp and mushrooms but neither could be detected.  It had the taste and consistency of fish cake and needed shoyu for flavor. \n\nChinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - $7.60.  AKA choy sum.  They were served chilled, a first for me.  Good portion, fresh and steamed perfectly but could've used more oyster sauce drizzled on top.  \n\nPotstickers - $11.70, 6-pieces.  Pricey but they are of the larger variety and stuffed full with a savory pork mixture.  No sauce was available sans for shoyu, vinegar and chili oil.  \n\nHoney Baked Seabass - $21.75, one tiny piece.  Holy pricey for the portion size!?  The small, boneless filet was insanely tender like butterfish and finished with a slightly sweet-savory honey sauce.  Very tasty but not worth the price.  \n\nMinced Chicken in Lettuce Cup - $6.35 per cup.  That's right, just one leaf of an iceberg lettuce will set you back that much.  The chicken mixture was generous in portion size, tasty and included pine nuts, shiitake mushrooms and bacon. \n\nShanghai Kurobuta Pork Dumplings - $14, 6-pieces.  Sold as their house specialty, be careful when consuming them as they squirt out juice.  It's best to pop the whole dumpling in your mouth.  Inside is a small helping of pork mixture surrounded by its steamed juices which were light in flavor. \n\nChicken Feet - $5.85.  I got about four feet, chopped in halves and finished in a non-spicy chili oil sauce.  Tender and tasty but I've had better at Legend Restaurant in Honolulu.  \n\nPork & Shrimp Siu Mye - $7.60, 4-pieces.  We couldn't detect the pork, but the shrimp was visible.  Moist but bland.  Pass the shoyu, please.  \n\nEgg Custard Tart - $12.70, 4-pieces.  My favorite Chinese dessert!  The crust was light, flaky and buttery.  The custard was filling was very good.  \n\nOrange Jello - $6.35, 4-pieces.  I have no idea how they make these, but orange-flavored Jello was cleverly molded onto actual orange skins.  The Jello consistency was thicker and more gritty than traditional Jello.  The flavor was refreshing, almost like actual orange juice.  \n\nSERVICE:\nEveryone was so professional and patient, unlike your typical Chinese joints.

They have carts here so you can do it the right way and order from those, or if you're more comfortable ordering from a menu and waiter, that's an option too.\n\nMost of the dishes were pretty standard, but there were a few that I especially enjoyed more:\n* Baked BBQ Pork Bun ($7.35 for 3) - delicious bbq pork filling and super fluffy, slightly sweet bun\n* Shanghai Kurobuta Pork Dumpling / Xiao Long Bao ($14 for 6) - relatively thin skin that holds the dumpling well, lots of soup\n* Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai ($7.35 for 4) - very tender and flavorful\n* Egg Custard Tart ($12.05 for 4) - incredibly silky custard; flaky tart\n\nWe also ordered:\n* Steamed Rice Noodle Rolls ($9.15 for 3)\n* Steamed Spareribs ($5.65)\n* Shrimp & Chive Dumplings ($6.15 for 3)\n* Shrimp Dumplings ($7.35 for 4)\n* Peking Duck ($6.75 for 1 piece) - ridiculously expensive for 1 piece of duck and 1 bao, but at least the duck was good\n* Turnip Cake ($5.65 for 3)\n* Snap Peas in Chili Sauce ($7.35)\n* Sauteed String Beans ($9.15)\n* Honey Walnut Prawn ($13.55 for 6)\n* Honey Glazed Walnut Salad ($12.05) - not something I've seen at dim sum before. It was basically a pile of purple cabbage in some sort of dressing with honey glazed walnuts. Nice and refreshing if you're looking for something lighter\n* Szechuan Chicken ($9.70) - I feel like this isn't something normally offered at dim sum either\n* Phoenix Tailed Shrimp ($13.55 for 4) - nicely fried/crispy and very meaty\n* Sesame Ball ($12.05 for 4) - filled with yellow bean puree instead of the usual red bean but just as good\n\nFor 14 people, we ended up spending about $750 ($53/person). Honestly, the only reason I can think of for people coming here is to show that they have money to spend.

World famous Din Tai Fung only charge $9.5 for 10 pcs, and they are more professional too.\nSecond, Pork & Shrimp Siu Mye, it's nothing special than other dim-sum places, but you have that $7.15 for 4 pcs.\nNext, fried \"Sweet rice dumpling\"... bro you over-fried it, and it was $10.70 for 4 pcs.\nAnd peking duck rolled through, looks delicious, ordered 2 (funny it was priced by buns), $6.55 each bun. ($13.10 for 2 buns w/ little meats, and it wasn't really crispy). With same price, I could get a half duck with 6+ buns.\nMost ridiculous one, Egg custard Tart 4 pcs for $11.70, FXXX these are only 3 for $1.60 at Chinatown.\nI stopped ordering after I was aware of their pricing... total came up about $85 before tips for 2 people, and we were not full.\nOther things to be mentioned, they have 4 Spring Rolls for $10.70, and Wonton soup for $14, lol.\n\nThey have the old fashion style food carts and the dim-sum card stamping, but each food have their individual ridiculous pricing.\nCOME ON PLEASE, YOU CAN GET ALL THESE FOODS IN MULTIPLE DIM-SUM RESTAURANTS OVER CHINATOWN THAT ARE FEW BLOCKS AWAY THAT ARE WAY CHEAPER WITH EQUAL QUALITY OR EVEN BETTER.\n\nI'm a college student, their price didn't seem right to me. If you are not rich like me, you better avoid this place.\nIf you are rich, I still suggest you to go over Chinatown's Dim-Sum restaurants for a different experience with wayyyyyyyy reasonable price point.\nI'm Chinese, and Dim-sum has never been that expensive before...

Dishes run between an understandable $5 and a ludicrous $21 (for the sea bass). Most of the dishes are also relatively small, further compounding the costliness of the restaurant. We spent $30+ for 5 thin pieces of Peking duck, whereas a whole duck would be cheaper at other places. As good as the food is, I am still unsure as to whether or not it warrants the price.

I was a little skeptical about the egg custard because the name kind of put me off, but it was very yummy - tasted kind of like a caramel custard to me.

"], "author": "Stella M.", "review": "I'm torn between giving this place between 2 and 3 stars, but because it does have redeeming qualities (i.e. good food), I will be generous and give Yank Sing 3 stars. Fiance said he would give this place 2 stars.\n\nThis review is based on three experiences.\n\n1. Inquiry/meeting as potential wedding reception site:\n\nI'm getting married and because I'm Chinese there was no way I was going to serve my family American food. God forbid I make my grandma eat a salad!\nHowever, I also wanted to host my reception at a \"nice\" venue. I looked high and low for a Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area that did not have tacky decor (you know what I mean - flying dragons). The choices are limited and the other \"high-end\" Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area just didn't work out for with some of our priorities. \n\nYank Sing seemed to meet all of our needs:\n-Aesthetically-pleasing Chinese food \n- We could book the entire restaurant to accommodate our 100 guests and thus, did not have to share the space with other restaurant patrons (not possible with HK East Ocean unless we wanted to fork over $20,000).\n-Beautiful decor and ambience\n-Great reviews on service\n-Validated parking for guests\n\nWe met with Daisy Hung who was very professional, prompt, and answered all of our questions in great detail. We were considering our menu combinations and Daisy worked with us to reprice out all of our menu substitutions.\n\nSince we did not want to spent close to $1000 on a tasting, we decided to try their dim sum.\n\n2. Dim sum experience: \n\nSo my fiance and I made a reservation for dim sum on a weekend. I don't know about weekdays, but if you don't make reservations you will probably not eat. The place was completely packed.\n\nInitially the cart pushers were very prompt and attentive. We ordered several traditional dim sum items as well as some food that's more likely served at banquets  and dinners such as the honey walnut shrimp, fried crab claws, and Chilean sea bass. Everything was very good. Not overly greasy.\n\nTowards the end, the carts didn't seem to stop by as often. I wanted to try their mango pudding since that was to be served at the wedding. It took about 10 minutes for someone to get this to me.\n\nWhen it was time to get the check it seemed like they were not concerned about all the people waiting for a table. We told them that we were ready to get the check. Waited for about 5 minutes and then my fiance goes to the restroom. When he is done, the check is still not ready. I went to the restroom, came back, and still no check. We had to flag several waitstaff for the check and after waiting about a total of 20 minutes we finally got it.\n\nI knew this was not going to be a cheap meal especially because we got the sea bass. However, $90 on dim sum for 2 people is just insane. Seriously, you can get dim sum on par to this place for half the price. The food was really good, but not THAT good.\n\n3. Booking Yank Sing for wedding venue: NOT POSSIBLE for 2014\n\nDespite the slow service towards the end of our meal, we still wanted to book Yank Sing for our reception site. \n\nWe were emailing Daisy back and forth and wanted to see about the pricing for a few menu substitutions. We didn't hear from her for a few days and she said that she's been busy with wedding banquets and will get back to us the following week. No word from her that week so we send a follow-up email. For another week, still no word from her. Finally after about 2 and a half weeks, we get this email from her: \n\n\"Thank you for your email, my sincere apologies for the delay. \n\nUnfortunately, after much thought and consideration, our company has made a decision to restructure our business model and therefore will not be taking events from 2014 onwards. We sincerely thank you for considering Yank Sing for your special day, and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. \n\nWith kind regards,\nDaisy\"\n\nAt this point, I was really upset. We had been communicating for about 2 months and was looking forward to checking this item off my list. Now back to square one.\n\nIn the end, I think things will all work out! We found a reception site and booked Ginger Cafe for our catering. So far, they've been so amazing. I'll write an official review after our wedding.\n\nFinal words: Try Yank Sing if you want to impress your date and have the funds to overspend on dim sum. I'm glad that I got to try this place, but I will not be returning.\n\nGlad to get this off my chest!!!\n\ntl;dr -  Good food, but too expensive for dim sum. Long wait time to receive check.

Therefore, I really don't have anything to compare this place to. \n\nI thought this place was fantastic though! I came here with two other people who eat here about once every month or two and I let them do most of the ordering (I'll eat just about anything). One of our dining companions only eats gluten-free foods, so there were a few items that she ordered that I didn't get a chance to taste. \n\nThe two of us non-gluten free people started with an order of pork pot-stickers and chicken egg rolls. They weren't bad, but they were probably my two least favorite things that we had. These were the only two non-steamed items that we had, and I'm thinking it's because of this they didn't taste as fresh as some of the other items we ordered (they were a little greasy). \n\nThe first two steamed items that we tried were the shrimp dumplings, which were awesome (they were basically all shrimp) and the Sui Mai? (I think that's what those pork dumplings are called?), and they were delicious! We also had two orders of the the steamed pork buns, which were highly recommended by one of our dining companions, and they did not disappoint. We also has the Shanghai dumplings (those soup dumpling things), which were great (these seem to be a popular item here). \n\nOur gluten free companion had some sort of leaf-wrapped rice patty thing that actually looked really good as well as the mushroom/chicken dumplings (I guess whatever they use as the \"dumpling\" with this item is gluten free). \n\nFor dessert we had mango pudding as well these sesame apricot ball things, which were both delicious! I'm not sure what kind of tea we had (it wasn't the jasmine), but it was good as well. \n\nSince I was a dim sum virgin, it's kind of hard for me rate the service since dim sum service works a little differently than a restaurant where you would order off a menu. However, the carts came around often and all the servers seemed to know the dishes pretty well.

Actually I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to Chinese food in general...after all, coming from Flushing, NY, I feel like I've definitely been spoiled. There is a certain level of quality that I expect and anything that doesn't match that standard is \"meh\" or just \"ok.\" So with that said, Yank Sing would have probably earned 3 stars because that's how I felt about the food - good but not great; executed well but doesn't really have an impact. However, $10.90 for 6 pieces of xiao long bao??? (Shanghai steamed dumplings) $8.70 for an order of cong you bing??? (scallion pancakes) My mom and I ordered 10 items and the bill was over $100!!! For dim sum...that was pretty crazy...and we didn't even order a lot of the \"high end\" food except for Peking duck. Honestly...unless the food is extremely amazing, there should be no way that dim sum should end up to be this expensive. And even then, most dim sum items are fried or street-food/ish...so this is the reasoning for the 2 star rating.\n\nMy goal is to find a place with good Shanghai steamed dumplings. I've given up on finding amazing xiaolongbao...I've long come to the (jaded) conclusion that only Joe's Shanghai could make amazing xiaolongbao. While these dumplings were soupy and tasty, the soup doesn't lack the thickness or viscosity that makes really great xiaolongbao great. These were merely good...but honestly...for the price...I was very disappointed. Especially when I knew Joe's Shanghai's xiaolongbao would be twice as good and half the price with 8 pieces instead of 6. Peking duck was dry unfortunately and at ~$5 for 1 piece, kind of expensive. There were two standouts, however. The curry pork bun was really good, but again, I could get just as good for less elsewhere. The cong you bing, despite the ridiculous price, was my favorite...flaky, light, and full of flavor, it was the best dimsum item we had.\n\nYank Sing also excels at desserts (which at normal dim sum places I never get to try since I'm usually too stuffed for dessert). The mango pudding was really yummy and refreshing. And the real stand out is the mango ice cream pie...cold ice cream (that somehow sticks together and doesn't melt!), delicious crust, a cheesecake bottom...this is probably the wierdest item I've enjoyed at a dimsum place, but it was definitely the best thing on the menu!\n\nWhile I've heard good things about Yank Sing, I felt like it didn't live up to the expectations that I had and the felt was simply just ok. Most of the diners were white and a lot of the menu items definitely seemed catered to non-Asian audiences (probably that mango ice cream pie!) and the menu doesn't have any Chinese on it (besides the name of the restaurant).

Then the trolleys start coming and coming and coming.....Whoa Nellie! \nMy daughter was totally overwhelmed, and after she had about 6 plates already on the table, I told her maybe that was enough to start.\n( I mean her BF hadn't even showed up yet) \nI see you'd never starve at YS but it's almost too much, they are at your table every couple of minutes offering dishes. After we had consumed the food on the plates (BF showed up in the middle of the Dim Sum eating frenzy) we carefully picked a couple more of the favorites. And I ordered one dish of duck in a bun (very delish). \nAll our Dim Sum was very good, even the shrimp toast that someone had complained about on another post.\nAnd to top off our meal, a mango pudding with a little condensed sweetened milk....mmmmmmmmm\nSo my final view of the meal: Great service, Great Food, Classy high end ambiance, but double what I'd pay if eating in Chinatown. \nGlad I got to experience it, but I'm happy spending less and getting the same elsewhere...just my preference.

The soup was tasty, although honestly, I sometimes can't tell the difference between shark's fin and vermicilli.\n\n4) Duck with bun - I've always loved duck... add hoisin sauce and those buns with some scallions and it's heaven in my mouth! The duck skin was nice and crispy and you couldn't taste on the fat going down your throat.\n\n5) Fook Yin Rice - I'm honestly not a fan of this, the sauce is just a bit much for me.

Service is maybe above the typical dim sum restaurant, but the ambiance here was more or less the same, so I'm not really sure what warrants a price tag of 2x the normal dim sum prices. The dim sum is good, but it's also not anything mindblowingly better than your average-priced dim sum spot. If it weren't for a work lunch, I honestly would probably never come to Yank Sing.\n\nI came with a large group so we got to order a LOT of items. They have carts here so you can do it the right way and order from those, or if you're more comfortable ordering from a menu and waiter, that's an option too.\n\nMost of the dishes were pretty standard, but there were a few that I especially enjoyed more:\n* Baked BBQ Pork Bun ($7.35 for 3) - delicious bbq pork filling and super fluffy, slightly sweet bun\n* Shanghai Kurobuta Pork Dumpling / Xiao Long Bao ($14 for 6) - relatively thin skin that holds the dumpling well, lots of soup\n* Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai ($7.35 for 4) - very tender and flavorful\n* Egg Custard Tart ($12.05 for 4) - incredibly silky custard; flaky tart\n\nWe also ordered:\n* Steamed Rice Noodle Rolls ($9.15 for 3)\n* Steamed Spareribs ($5.65)\n* Shrimp & Chive Dumplings ($6.15 for 3)\n* Shrimp Dumplings ($7.35 for 4)\n* Peking Duck ($6.75 for 1 piece) - ridiculously expensive for 1 piece of duck and 1 bao, but at least the duck was good\n* Turnip Cake ($5.65 for 3)\n* Snap Peas in Chili Sauce ($7.35)\n* Sauteed String Beans ($9.15)\n* Honey Walnut Prawn ($13.55 for 6)\n* Honey Glazed Walnut Salad ($12.05) - not something I've seen at dim sum before. It was basically a pile of purple cabbage in some sort of dressing with honey glazed walnuts. Nice and refreshing if you're looking for something lighter\n* Szechuan Chicken ($9.70) - I feel like this isn't something normally offered at dim sum either\n* Phoenix Tailed Shrimp ($13.55 for 4) - nicely fried/crispy and very meaty\n* Sesame Ball ($12.05 for 4) - filled with yellow bean puree instead of the usual red bean but just as good\n\nFor 14 people, we ended up spending about $750 ($53/person). Honestly, the only reason I can think of for people coming here is to show that they have money to spend. The food was good but not spectacular or special, and the ambiance doesn't match up to the prices. Business lunches don't even really make sense for me here since the ambiance is the same as big dim sum restaurants in Chinatown. I guess if you're craving dim sum specifically in the Embarcadero area..\n\nDo yourself a favor and go somewhere else for dim sum.

I had only been to Yank Sing for dim sum 2 other times, and never really got exactly what I wanted since I went with my Caucasian co-workers. I didn't want to scare them with the traditional Chinese dishes. \n\nThe scene:\n\nYank Sing is very fancy so be prepared to shell out $20-$30 per person on dim sum.\n\nThe food:\n\nWhat sets Yank Sing apart from other dim sum restaurants are their original dishes such as the succulent sea bass and the red cabbage salad. The sea bass is definitely my favorite, but it's $18 a plate! Their house made chili sauce is bomb too. It's similar to XO sauce minus the seafood. I believe they also sell it at 99 Ranch Market.\n\nShu-mai (meat balls) - I'm not a big shu-mai fan, even though it is a traditional dim sum item. I always found it too meaty, nothing special. However, Yank Sing's version of the shu-mai is so flavorful and juicy! It's almost like the meat in a xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup dumpling).\n\nHar-gow (shrimp dumpling) - This har-gow really wasn't any different than any other har-gow.\n\nBeef cherng-fun (noodle roll filled with ground beef) - By far, my favorite dish at any dim sum restaurant. They put way too much cilantro in their cherng fun though. I am not a fan.\n\nFried tofu - Again, nothing mind blowing. This was just cold, lightly fried tofu with soy sauce. I love tofu, so I usually get this at any Chinese restaurant that serves it.\n\nJin Dui (sesame ball filled with lotus paste) - This is THE BEST jin dui ever. I could just get an order of this and be satisfied. The doughy skin was thin, chewy and crispy. The inside dough is orange in color, which makes me assume the dough is made from yams. I could be wrong. The inside filling is a sweet lotus paste rather than the red bean.\n\nWe ended up spending $25 a person for only 6 dishes.

The Ha Gow was one of the worst I've had. Its like  an imitation shrimp ball inside a rice skin. Not yummy. TC Pastry on Irving tastes much fresher and much more natural (natural pieces of shrimp and some waterchestnut in a thin, moist rice skin? delish!) The green beans with dried shrimp and ginger was my favorite here. Very flavorful! My second favorite was the spinach dumpling (I hope it didn't have cilantro and that my reaction was only to the curry dumpling). The rice roll w/shrimp was good after i ordered it without cilantro and the walnut shrimp was pretty good, but just like any other dim sum place. The sesame ball was good.

The dim sum is great and they have a full bar.  I would've given them 5 stars but service can be slow at times and they need more bathrooms to handle their capacity (2 stalls for 200+ people is kind of weak).   On the plus side the bathroom and the restaurant are both very clean.  It's best to call ahead to make a reservation since even with a reservation you're looking at a 5-10 minute wait.  There's generally a 20-25 minute wait without a reservation.\n\nBBQ Pork Buns - tasty and filling.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps - Yummy and refreshing.\n\nGinger pork Shanghai dumplings  - one of their best dishes.
