The fougasse was OMG, warm bread with bacon (or ham??) baked into the bread. It reminded me of chinese bakeries that sell/serve ham & scallion buns except this is way better because the pieces of bacon were bigger & just heavenly (5 pieces in an order, make sure u order 2 if more than 3 ppl in your group).\n\nI had the must try arugula salad w/poached egg. As suggested, mix it all up together..you get this fantastic creamy yolk wrapped with the peppery arugula & cured ham, fava bean puree w/the fried spring onion. I swear, poached egg in a salad takes things to a whole other spectrum..silky goodness.\n\nWe tried the english pea soup- a creamy, hammy based soup with some small potato chunks that was piping HOT (a good thing!!). We liked the soup as it wasn't just creamy but with the ham & potato, it gave texture. OOHH, fougasse dipped in soup..ahhh, tasty..\n\nEntrees-we ordered the Lamb loin, medium rare & the stuffed chicken. Both entrees were delicious. The lamb loin was good but next time, i personally might order it Medium (medium rare was just a bit too rare IMO but it wasn't my own entree this time around). I loved the haricot verts & summer squash salad that the lamb loin sat on..perfect summer veggies for the weird warm day SF experienced. Now, I rarely order chicken at a restaurant w/the fear of DRY chicken but the chef recommended it & i went with it. Finally, a chicken that wasn't dry & it was perfectly seasoned, paired well with the poached(?) half peach. It also came w/brussel sprouts cream which I thought was creamed spinach until i looked at the menu again..who knew? it was a nice take on that little cabbage! \n\nWe also tried the polenta & comte side dish--yum, I can eat this all the time. The polenta texture & creaminess was perfect with the slight cheddary nutty comte cheese mixed in. \nChef also sent out a complimentary dish of the wild mushrooms medley which I was eyeing on the menu but I thought spicy apple sauce would be weird. The spicy apple sauce definitely toned the woody-ness of the mushrooms. These really were wild mushrooms & definitely had the strong funghi, woody, umami flavor but with the apple sauce (which i thought was odd at first), i can see why it goes together. It had that interesting sweet/savory balance, not really spicy at all as noted. \n\nWe shared the creme fraiche custard w/sea salt & the caramel creme(was it creme? it definitely was caramel flavored) dessert. That was really good too, a creamy, not overly sweet dessert but at this point we were stuffed beyond belief. Of course, we still finished every bite of the dessert. \n\nPortions are not big by american standards but I prefer it that way. You can order different dishes to share, taste, eat & still be stuffed. All the food had such different tastes, flavor profiles, textures that it's just amazing to think it came from that small kitchen. I cannot wait to try the smoked salmon next time w/fougasse!!!\n\nAlso, they had a great selection of french wines by the glass or bottle & interesting microbrews. We enjoyed our glasses of Neri Rose wine, it was slightly dry & refreshingly chilled\nSuper close walking distance to Sutter Stockton garage (a huge plus in my book).

I like the concept of mixing the creaminess of uni with oyster though.\n\n1st: Truffle Poached Quail Egg, Chicory Salad - nice warm salad with fresh ingredients. quail egg added a good creaminess to the refreshing and subtle dressing.\n\n1st; Lobster and prawn creamy bisque, crab salad - very creamy lobster bisque, but the flavor was much heavier on the smoky prawn side. Prawn is cooked to perfection. Crispy shell and tender tail.\n\n2nd: Smoked duck Carpaccio - nicely smoked. I liked the slightly chewy texture and the just right amount of savoriness cured in.\n\n2nd: Avocado and Crab Napoleon - This one was alright. the crab was very nicely flavored and the portion was generous. However avocado over powered the rest of the flavors. Avocado is hard to control though.\n\n3rd: Seared Scallop, parnip puree and tarragon sauce - Best dish of the night. You can't beat a good scallop seared to perfection with the right green herbal sauce. Crispy outside and tender and moist inside.\n\n3rd: Venison Loin, black truffle, wild cherry jus - Venison wasn't too gamy and the cherry sauce was well done, deglazing the jus of venison into a hearty sauce that is not overly sweet nor bitter.\n\nDessert: Chai tiramisu - I love tiramisu, but this one was not the best. Still it was nice.\n\nDessert: Foundant au chocolat - I'm not a dessert person, but the warm foundant was good.

The waiter is a tad imposing, large and a bit frequent in trying to force an order, but pleasantly rare after.  I made reservations (though I needn't have for this rainy Sunday morning), and even parking proved not too challenging, quiet feat on its own.  But in any case the menu was small enough to be a right-of-passage, us eventually settling on three items while mentally nothing that we'd probably, like any good hobbit, require a second breakfast.  Translation: expected tiny portions.\n\nFresh Fruit Bellini 10\nCharming, simple, light.  It would take fifty of these for me to feel a buzz, though I would sadly grow tired of it long before then.

Sweet and supple, water on the side much appreciated.\n\nRoasted Banana and Peanut Butter Beignets, Preserved Straberries 12\nThe first plate to arrive, the beignets, were visually obviously handmade and pleasantly light, too.  They're a bit like donuts, the peanut butter not too strong at all much to my pleasure, while the banana flavor proved subtle but more notable.  Despite its lightness, it's a tad strong as a sole opener, though probably too subtle as a dessert.\n\nScallop Crudo, Pomelo and Grapefruit, Prawns, Apple Slaw 15\nIndeed the scallops are fresh though thinly sliced, the rest of the dish dwarfing it in comparison; this doesn't say much as the portioning itself is on the small side, but it is overall good and balanced to some degree, lighter in taste than the others presented, as would be hoped for in a seafood dish.\n\nHand Cut Beef Tenderloin Tartar, Basil and Parmesan Pesto, Fingerling Chips 15\nThere's always a bit of an odd feeling when green is combined with a meat of any kind, especially one that leans more to the rare side than well done.  Unless of course it's dragon.  But moving past that major aesthetic flaw, this dish proved to be my favorite in taste, perhaps the most balanced in flavor profile altogether.  The chips are housemade and remind of me Zanzibar Cafe in San Diego; the basil and parmesan make an excellent accompaniment to the finger food.\n\nThe soft conversation, helped by there being only three or four occupied tables throughout, provides a nice atmosphere of peace.  There isn't much space in the restaurant or on the tables, or to be honest much on the plates anyway, but we managed to walk out of the restaurant full enough not to get that second breakfast, as marginal as the first was.

Restaurant after restaurant, it just seemed like the same old dishes -- roasted chicken (or quail), braised short ribs, or grilled pork chop with some kind of tart fruit glaze. It got to the point where I started to never crave anything that was \"Contemporary-American-French.\" In fact, without foie gras, I feel like French food (at least in SF) has become boring in general. Tasty, perhaps, but boring. That is until I came to Bouche. \n\nNow, there were some small misses here and there, but honestly, the food at Bouche breathes so much new creative life into the SF food scene that it's worth those small flaws to enjoy a meal that actually makes Contemporary French exciting again.\n\n--------------\nFOOD:\n\nScallops:\nI loved the intricate and subtly sweet flavor to this dish. The dish is a cold dish, which kind of caught me off guard, but the scallops were insanely tender. \n\nMarinated Salmon:\nThis was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The salmon meshed perfectly with the crunchy (equivalent of a) bird's nest and the creme fraiche. I've never had anything like this before and it was an incredible first.\n\nLamb Shoulder:\nI normally don't like lamb due to its sour gaminess, but the lamb shoulder is cooked to absolute perfection. It tastes like a very tender braised beef short rib, which is awesome for those who normally hate lamb. What really makes this dish, though, is the sauce -- a sweet marmalade with crunchy almonds-- that really brings out the flavor of the lamb shoulder. I could've done without the tangy sorbet-like carrot coriander puree, since there was so much sweetness in the marmalade already. Perhaps a more subtle puree, like turnip or potato, would complement the marmalade better.\n\nVeal:\nThe veal had an amazing flavor, but it was a bit too well-done. Whatever flavors they used though, worked very well.\n\nCreme Fraiche Panna Cotta:\nThis dessert was a bit too boring and tasteless for me, except those moments when all you have in your mouth is salt (not enjoyable either).

We made a 5:30 reservation using opentable.  They called us earlier in the day to make sure we were coming and of course, I said yes!\n\nPARKING:\nWe parked in a parking structure right by Union Square.  Don't remember what it's called [Sutter Stockton Garage] but  Bouche was literally a block away from the structure.  So it worked out quite nicely!  I don't remember the rates but depending on which hour of the day you park, you pay a different amount for each hour you're there.  It ranges from $1-$4.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nThis place is TINY! No wonder they made sure we were going to be on time for our reservations.  There's probably 25 seats total.  The main dining area is upstairs with 2-3 person tables.  And several seats downstairs by the kitchen.  I loved the feel of it. Very cozy, homey.  I loved all the decor, a nice antique look.  And the kitchen/line where they prep the food is pretty small and you can see everything going on.  It looked like all they had in the back was a dish pit.\n\nSERVICE:\nHeh, felt sorry for the servers who had to climb up and down the stairs, but they were very attentive and refilled our glasses when needed.  No complaints.\n\nFOOD:\nI'm guessing due to their small size and extremely tiny kitchen {if you can even call it that], it explains why their menu has very little selection.  But hey, I love it that way! Quality over quantity!\n\nSauteed Sweetbread, Porcini Cream, Chanterelles and Black Trumpet Mushroom Persillade\n\nIt looks like their dishes vary slightly than what's on their website.  It's small things though like the variety of mushroom they have on hand.  I believe online it says \"Lobster Mushroom Persillade\" but on the menu it was \"Black Trumpet\".  Just FYI.\n\nIt was my first time having sweetbreads WHICH is not actually bread.  If I tell you what it actually is you probably won't want to eat it [and now you're going to look it up if you don't know].  But it was delicious! The texture was lovely, crispy and soft on the inside.  Flavor was great and all the earthiness of the mushrooms complimented it well.  The only slightly negative thing I have to say was it was a bit too salty for me.  But overall, a great first try at sweetbreads and would love to eat it again!\n\nWild Greens, Caramelized Pear, Roquefort, Walnut and Endive Vinaigrette, Pepper Crust Bacon And Pickled Poached Egg\n\nDespite it being a salad, it was amazing!  The greens were mostly arugula.  The pear added sweetness and the bacon added crunch and saltiness.  We were told to break the egg, mix it with the vinaigrette and eat it with the salad. The roquefort was actually in the sauce as well. It was a delicious amazing salad.  The richness of the egg yolk and cheese balanced out the spicy bite of the arugula.  The acidity of the vinaigrette cut through the richness.  It was well balanced and really delicious.  It was probably my favorite dish of the night. [A salad?? No way! Yeah I know, thought it wouldn't happen either]\n\nPan Seared Petrale Sole, Crispy Porcini Risotto, Espelette and Carrot Puree, Lobster Cream Sauce\n\nThe sole was lovely.  Cooked well,, nice and tender.  The risotto {more like an arancini in this case) was delicious as well, added some texture.  The puree was amazing.  Smooth and sweet bursting with lovely carrot flavor.  And the cream sauce tying it all together.  This was definitely my parents favorite dish.\n\nCitrus and Honey Confit Lamb Shank, Ratatouille, Roasted Almonds and Pomegrante Couscous\n\nI was a little disappointed with this dish.  The lamb shank was tasty as was the rataoutille.  But everything was SO HEAVY, it need some kind of acid to cut through the richness.  The pomegranates and the citrus in the couscous helped a tiny bit, but after finishing the dish, I just wanted to drink some lemon juice, straight.  It was also a touch too salty, though I guess the lack of salt in the couscous made up for that.\n\nTomahawk Pork Chop, Butter Beans, Walnut and Quince Marmalade Grape and Cognac Sauce\n\nI didn't get to try everything on this plate together, but none of us REALLY liked this dish much.  The pork was a bit overcooked which of course meant dry.  The butter beans were alright.  I don't know, nothing really impressed me about this dish or left me wanting more.  \n\nOverall, a great experience.

The dish is a cold dish, which kind of caught me off guard, but the scallops were insanely tender. \n\nMarinated Salmon:\nThis was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The salmon meshed perfectly with the crunchy (equivalent of a) bird's nest and the creme fraiche. I've never had anything like this before and it was an incredible first.\n\nLamb Shoulder:\nI normally don't like lamb due to its sour gaminess, but the lamb shoulder is cooked to absolute perfection. It tastes like a very tender braised beef short rib, which is awesome for those who normally hate lamb. What really makes this dish, though, is the sauce -- a sweet marmalade with crunchy almonds-- that really brings out the flavor of the lamb shoulder. I could've done without the tangy sorbet-like carrot coriander puree, since there was so much sweetness in the marmalade already. Perhaps a more subtle puree, like turnip or potato, would complement the marmalade better.\n\nVeal:\nThe veal had an amazing flavor, but it was a bit too well-done. Whatever flavors they used though, worked very well.\n\nCreme Fraiche Panna Cotta:\nThis dessert was a bit too boring and tasteless for me, except those moments when all you have in your mouth is salt (not enjoyable either). The caramel sauce was a nice touch, but it just needed something else to really make this panna cotta memorable.\n\n--------------\n\nBouche has an intimate, hidden atmosphere that really brings out a rustic, underground Paris ambiance. It's actually pretty cool. Kind of reminds me of the upstairs section of Gitane. \n\nShane, our server, was on point. Our water was always filled, our wine glasses were never empty. \n\nAll in all, what I love most about Bouche is that it really pushes the envelope when it comes to discovering wildly inventive flavors. Most of what I ate tonight brought flavors and textures that I've never had before, and it was incredible to experience. I'm impatiently looking forward to a return visit.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Pork chop was mediocre (at best), for the price, I prefer NOPA.
