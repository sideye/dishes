So we ended up at Burger Bar - wait, correction... we ended up at Burger Bar after finding out there's at least a 2 hour wait time at the Cheesecake Factory (I know, not that much better...).\n\nThe wait time at the Burger Bar will almost always be better than the alternative (50 minutes versus 2 hours).  \n\nOnce you take the elevator upstairs, you immediately arrive at the Burger Bar - which is nice.  And the hostess is already there to write your name down.  Immediately after seeing this, I thought that it was a bit inefficient.  Granted, not all restaurants have the pager system that hand out, but I felt that with the long list that they have - they should seriously consider in implementing it.  This way, their hallway will not be crowded with guests waiting for their names to be called.  Moreover, that they don't butcher people's name when they call them out. Also, since it's inside Macy's people will be able to move around and shop to their heart's content and not have to return every 5 minutes to ask if they've been called yet or what their status on their list is (which I've done 3 times and another person has done... even more frequently than myself).\n\nMoving on, once called the waitress shows you to your table and the place is crowded with not much room to move around (my mom is legally blind and it was a bit of a challenge to help move her around all the standing people, waiters, and chairs in the way).  I felt that this place needs more space or a better controlled environment.\n\nOnce seated, it took a long time before the waters were handed out (it would have been nice to have straws to accompany the water, but I suppose you have to request for them around here).  \n\nIt took even longer before our waiter (it changed from the waitress that we initially had, I wonder where she went...) came to take our order.\n\nThe prices on the menu is a bit higher than I anticipated, but considering that this is a tourist area and inside Macy's it shouldn't be too surprising.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nKobe Burger with Sweet Potato Fries (19.85)\nBurger Sliders with Skinny Fries (12.75)\nKobe Burger with Pepper Jack (17.45)\nCaramel Latte Shake (8.75)\nBlack & White Milkshake (8.75)\nLarge Pellegrino (8)\n\nIn short, I repeat that a lot of things on this list is too overpriced (note the milkshake, the latte, and the sparkling water.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the milkshake is almost worth it.  The sweet potato fries is recommended, but the kobe burger is a bit bland for my taste.  It needs more seasoning or something but it was still decent.\n\nIn short, this place needs a vast improvement in terms of service and the way the position the tables and handling crowd control.  The food is decent, but needs more work.  A part of me wonders if the food would taste better if their cooks had more time to prepare them.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-01-02"}], "burger bar chicken wings": [{"excerpts": ["I always buy the burger bar chicken wings or salmon steak.

While being in Macy's at Union Square I remembered Burger Bar was on top of the Macy's building (not literally as in rooftop but 6th floor). So, off we go.\n\nFrom the lobby floor at Macy's to Burger Bar the transition was quite simple. Not too confusing. Although alot of hussle and bussle. The combination of tourists stopping snapping away and sightseeing, to the locals, to the employees the area can get pretty hectic. Being that Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf are the tourist mecca of San Francisco the prices can be somewhat inflated. Just an fyi.\n\nOnce at Burger Bar we were seated immediately by the hostess and that's when I realized I should have requested a window table overlooking Union Square....Next time. Looking at the menu the first thing that stood out to me was that $60.00 dollar burger. I said to myself how in the world can a burger be worth $60.00 bucks? I found out soon enough when I saw what was included in this burger.\n \nIt's called the \"Remixed Rossini Burger\" (Kobe beef stuffed with braised short ribs, topped with a lobster tail, shaved black truffles, truffle sauce on an onion bun. \"SOLD\". Not only was this a unique combination but the shaved truffles and lobster tail was my deciding factor. Burger was great, worth $60.00? I think so. Nice flavor, Kobe beef with the stuffed short ribs was delicious, lobster tail was fresh and the truffle sauce went hand in hand. I'd definitely order this giant burger again.  Towards the end the onion bun could not support all the ingredients and the experience started to get sloppy and I refused to use a knife and fork on a burger. I had to put my pride to the side and use that knife and fork or I would have had to resort to eating like a caveman. Extra napkins please!\n\nIn summary, I thought the Remixed Rossini Burger was great. Expensive but nonetheless worth it in my opinion. Service could have been better. Had to wait a while on the menu out of all things. Besides the $60.00 Rossini burger Burger Bar offers a wide variety of burgers. Vegan, Vegetarian to the \"World's hottest hamburger\".

The only area that was first-come, first-serve was the actual bar which could seat 15 peeps, 20 peeps at the most. Nothing opened up during our entire wait.

Was it the best burger i've ever had? No.\n2. Was it a good burger? Sure.\n3. Is the price/potential wait worth this good, but not perfect burger? No.\n\nFor those who are satisfied with my quick statements, ciao and thanks for visiting my review! For those who crave the whys and whats, here are the details entailed in the style of my usual reviews:\n\nI came in to Burger Bar at SF with mild expectations. I say mild because I have heard through word-of-mouth that this burger joint has long lines, overpriced food, and food that is \"eh.\" Nonetheless, on a beautiful day in SF where I couldn't think of where to eat in Union Square for an early dinner (5pm), my gf and I decided to try Burger Bar, considering we don't have to fight a crowd at the this early bird time. \n\nFood:\n\nEntree(s): note about their entrees - most of the regular burgers (black angus, kobe, etc) do not come with fries. They must be ordered on the side. However, certain \"signature chef burgers,\" such as the Hubert Keller Burger, Rossini Burger, etc. come with fries. All burgers, however, come with the basics: lettuce, tomatoes, pickle. You also have a choice of buns, including plain, sesame, onion, ciabatta, sourdough, and wholewheat. \n\nAmerican Kobe Beef Burger: I decided to forego the fancy ingredient burgers and get the simple Kobe Beef burger so I can get a true, uninterrupted sampling of Chef  Keller's creations. I opted for the ciabatta bun and added avocado and an order of zucchini fries on the side. \n\nBurgers at upscale establishments such as this tend to shape their meat patties in a similar fashion: a smaller in circumference, but thicker patty. My American Kobe was just like that. Cooked exactly as I wanted it (medium well). I decided to skip the condiments to first get a real taste of the burger. I must say i was not that impressed with the flavor. The patty, though cooked perfectly, could not differentiate itself from  the flavor of any other meat patty i've had in the past, from backyard bbqs to other restaurants. I suppose the only difference I could taste was that the meat was moist and not dry. Given that, flavor was lacking and preferred the patty to be more seasoned. Could I tell it was Kobe? No.\n\nMy gf opted to treat herself to one of Hubert's more extravagant creations: Surf & Turf Burger. Black angus beef, grilled half lobster, asparagus, on a plain bun. Sounds to die for right? I almost wanted to get it myself but thought the combination of flavors would make it hard for me to appreciate just the meat patty. Fortunately for myself, I still got a hearty sampling of my gf's burger.\n\nTo my utter surprise, there was the same lack of flavor in the Surf/Turf burger. The lobster, though cooked perfectly (moist, but not undercooked) was also unseasoned. The black angus beef and lobster combination did not really blend for me. There was two separate ingredients put into a burger, but the combination just didn't add up. Same story: cooked well, but not flavorful enough. \n\nService:\n\nHard to review as it was a casual dining experience, but I can say our waitress did what was expected of her, gave us our food promptly, refilled our drinks, and was polite and friendly. No complaints. I also wanted to note that this establishment is notorious for the wait on a normal night and that I cannot attest to that since, as mentioned earlier, I came here at a very early time (5pm). \n\nOverall, unimpressed. Good food, but not great. Not worth the bill (our check was around 75 total for two people). I guess it was an experience to try, but I wish the flavor was there. I came away physically full, but my taste buds were still hungry and begging for something more satisfying.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-04-11"}, {"excerpts": ["No offense to the Rossini burger here, which I'm sure is amazing, but if any place decided to put shaved truffles, foie gras, and a wine reduction sauce on top of their burger I can't imagine those flavors not being superior to the rest of the menu, which is why I don't use that as my yardstick. \n\n"], "author": "Justin C.", "review": "Oh Hubert, you're a victim of your own success. Because we're used to such amazingly high standards from Fleur de Lys, we have equal expectations when dining at any of your other restaurants, including a place which at the basic premise is nothing more than a fancy McDonald's. I realize that's not a completely fair assessment, but let's be realistic, when you think of burgers fine dining is one of the last things that typically comes to mind. I could even accept the high-end burger concept, were it done to perfection, and felt like something grandiose rather than just a burger with some expensive topping(s) on it.\n\nWe initially came here hoping to see Hubert himself, after dining at FDL a few nights prior (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fleur-de-lys-san-francisco#hrid:2qTi2qd_ur5A6JDSrHACmA) and being told he's spending almost all his time here now. We've been huge fans of his long before the Top Chef Masters show took him into a new level of chef stardom, and we mainly wanted to thank him for inspiring some fantastic dishes at home, as well as for the fabulous dinner at FDL, but no luck, he wasn't in Burger Bar that night either. This fact became quite evident once we actually received our burgers.\n\nWe decided to go with one of the premade selection, the peppercorn burger, which is coated with peppercorn and dijon mustard and comes with a side of peppercorn. This was ok, I think the judge of a burger place is how well they perform with their basic burger concepts rather than how much fancy stuff you can add on at exorbitant amounts. No offense to the Rossini burger here, which I'm sure is amazing, but if any place decided to put shaved truffles, foie gras, and a wine reduction sauce on top of their burger I can't imagine those flavors not being superior to the rest of the menu, which is why I don't use that as my yardstick. \n\nThe sliders were miniscule (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=_pypfetOujQo-zkiJl60EA), probably the smallest I've ever seen. I barely got much of a taste of any of the 3 different types, and as a result they all tasted pretty much the same. The fries here are also forgettable, another shock at a place with this pedigree.\n\nProbably the biggest upside for me about Burger Bar was the custom milkshake options, because you can get essentially anything you've ever wanted in a milkshake added in, at least in the way of unhealthy chocolate-based products. I decided to go all dark with a mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake with chunks of skor bar, hazelnut mousse and homemade chocolate whipped cream. The consistency was perfect, and all the ingredients harmonious, a truly great milkshake.\n\nThe beef float paddle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=jUMkja8RKqLkuci_WD6BXw) was much less impressive, providing a subpar offering of beer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=cWPFhwGF7wEas3Lgcmpk9A) with ice cream floats which could barely handle their opposing flavors. The only one I really like was the Lindemans and vanilla ice cream combo, mainly because if you add Framboise to just about anything it tastes great. Other than that the Beamish and the Eel River were both ok, but the others were entirely too sour.\n\nA final little annoying thing about Burger Bar, the bathrooms were just rancid when I went in. I'm talking like gas station bad, soaked in urine smell. If you're going to try to pull of fine dining with a burger spin, then I expect to be all of your restaurant to be fine dining, not just your menu.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-02-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the Rossini burger.

When I first moved out here, Fleur De Lys was all the rage and after years now, Hubert Keller's brand is as strong as ever if not more so. Going on opening day knowing things are going to be crazy is a good way to set your expectations. Chef TV exposure? Grand Opening? The middle of touristville? Check, Check and Check.

Should I do it now? $60 is an awful lot and on opening day it's a risky proposition. So I decided for the peppercorn burger with some additions. Lo and behold the waiter said he couldn't do that. I guess some of the signature burgers have their own mise en place and you really mess with the line cooks if you add stuff. Ok, no big deal. So I went with a kobe buger, pepper bacon, pepper jack cheese, Fleur De Lys peppercorn sauce and then a half lobster for good measure. Damn that thing was yummy even though they went slightly over on my medium rare. Not enough blood (hmm that didn't sound right). Decent sweet potato fries and ok pickled jalapenos. The drinks were solid and the service was definitely on the tattered side as the tourist patron crush was non stop. \n\nTowards midnight Chef Keller popped in all dressed up (more like DJ Hubert Keller) and made his way directly to us and chatted  for a bit. We talked about the stress of opening something brand new and how things weren't going to calm down till about 1:30am for him. It's good to see that he values his customers experience and proceeded to say hi to a number of tables in the main room. \n\nI'd say if you really want to try this place and haven't already, wait. Let things get a but less hectic or eat late as they plan to hold 2am hours (thats awesome). Also keep in mind to the fact that the fame of the owner, the area it's and what they're striving for image wise, you're going to be paying a premium.

However, as a Georgia girl raised on a cattle farm, I can really appreciate a well-crafted burger and I do not find comfort in (for example) the ground shrimp concoctions that are taking the place of an all-beef patty on certain trendy menus. This being said, I was excited to visit Chef Hubert Keller's Burger Bar while I was staying in San Francisco this past month; it certainly did not hurt that my hotel was in eye-sight of the Macy's in which Burger Bar is located. My classmate, who works as a Chef in her own state, is just as much of a burger freak as I am and was thrilled at the idea of stopping in on our way back to the hotel from our romp around the Ferry Building. Upon checking-in with the hostess we were told to expect a 15 minute wait and were satisfied that we only had to stall for about 7 or 8 minutes. Even better, we were seated next to a window overlooking Union Square so that we could enjoy the beautiful day outside from our comfortable perch 6 stories up.\n\nWalking the hills again had re-whetted my appetite and thirst so I started my order with a Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen while Robin went for a flight of sampler pours including the Pyramid Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Pyramid Outburst Imperial IPA and the privately-labeled Burger Bar Brew. Robin seemed to enjoy getting to taste so many options and I thoroughly enjoyed my wheat beer; it was the perfect weather for this light, slightly yeasty wheat beer. Before we could make up our minds on burgers (there are SO many options to either pick a composed burger or to create your own from endless choices) we picked out an appetizer to split. The Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles were something to behold and provided the perfect combination of slightly pickled, flavorful heat and substantial batter to absorb the spicy juices and create a rich, yet slightly crisp, exterior. The chipotle aioli that accompanied the jalapeno fries provided just enough creaminess to balance the heat; I cannot see ordering these gems with any other sauce offered on the menu. Finally, as if the fun flavors were not enough, the battered peppers were served in a cute miniature fry-basket; this was a first in presentation for me!\n\nMulling over the menu while I munched on jalapenos helped to inspire my customized burger and Robin and I agreed that we were ready to place our next order just as our waitress approached. I was allowed to order first and chose a toasted onion bun as my base, the sustainable Country Natural burger (cooked mid-rare), caramelized onion and pan-seared foie gras for my add-ons and the rich red wine and shallot reduction as my sauce. After placing my order I guess Robin decided to simplify things and just asked for one of the same, right down to the skinny fries with a classic aioli. Despite my longing for the $60 Rossini Burger (a Kobe creation oozing black truffles and foie gras) I was thrilled with my own composition and I am comfortable to say that this ranked in my top five favorite burgers and is kept company by the Black Tie Burger of Minetta Tavern in Manhattan and the 10 O'clock Burger of Holeman & Finch in Atlanta (In-N-Out holds a spot near the top as well, but for totally different reasons). The burger was perfectly cooked and rich without being fatty and the foie gras added a beautiful element of creamy caramelization and decadence (gotta get your fix of California foie gras before July 1st!). The shallot reduction was the perfect finish to the structure and the fries were an excellent accompaniment without being too starchy, yet still satisfying.\n\nI will go back to Burger Bar again next time that I am on the west coast and would definitely check out Chef Keller's Las Vegas Burger Bar location next time I am in Sin City.

I did not expect a Fleur-de-Lys experience at Burger Bar SF in terms of service or atmosphere.  If I wanted a fancy Hubert Keller experience I would have booked a table at Fleur de Lys but that's for another time.\n\nI went back to Burger Bar SF and had the much-discussed Rossini burger.  Yes, it comes with Kobe beef, foie gras, and shaved truffles.  Yes, it is $60.  More than anything  I loved the concept of pushing the limits of flavor profiles of burgers. \n\nThe Rossini burger came out on a big plate with a side of  au jus, sea salt, black pepper, and skinny fries.  The truffle aroma was instantly released when I poured what I assumed was a truffle au jus.  I love that earthy smell.  Foie gras  added decadent richness, and the Kobe beef was perfectly cooked to medium doneness and had more of a \"chopped\" texture than the average ground meat texture and it tasted fantastic.   \n\nWas it better than the sum of its parts?  This is what made me think about this experience for two days and a visit to another one of my favorite burger places over the weekend, to mull it over.  In the end I felt  that the three kings of flavors were competing for attention and they did not necessarily come together as well as I had hoped.  \n\nBecause it is a burger I have to put the meat first.  And I realized they had to go with Kobe beef for it to stand against the truffle and foie gras.  The truffle and au jus were great flavor enhancers for the meat, but that left the poor foie gras out in the cold.  I like the classic pairing of foie gras with something sweet and fruity to offset its richness, but in this case the contrast was lacking.  Structurally it fell a little short, too,  because while the onion bun was a good choice for this ensemble, I don't think it was toasted, and it became soggy after the  au jus.  I ate my burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nNonetheless, I was happy with the experience.  Why?  Because it made me think for TWO whole days!  \n\nIncidentally you could get the truffle as a side with their other burgers at $30.  they have some interesting alcoholic and nonalcoholic milk shake options in addition to other beverage options.  I also had a dessert chocolate burger in which chocolate mousse serves as a 'meat' in a donut pastry 'bun'.  Cute. \n\nI am still a fan.

We really wanted to like the food., especially since we saw the very imposing-looking Hubert Keller wandering round the restaurant. Surely with The Man himself at the helm, the food would be superlative? Sadly, we found the food sub-standard. There were many tough pieces of gristle and fat in our burgers. Isn't Kobe beef, supposed top be tender and of a superior quality? This wasn't. This was far inferior to premium burgers we had eaten at Orson, Slow Club, Zuni, or our favorites Bix and Mission Beach Cafe. Mo's Grille or even humble In-n-Out would not have the kind of unacceptably poor burger grinding exhibited here, and the fact hubby and I both had 4-5 pieces of gristle each makes it hard to dismiss as a fluke. Also the fries were sub-standard - not crisp,  not fresh-tasting, not evenly cooked - neither of us finished our fries and I didn't finish my burger (hubby felt obliged to finish his burger after spending $60 on it!).\n\nThe milkshake was lovely, though a bit on the sweet side (the mention of Nutella gives the game away) - we really enjoyed it!\n\nWe did complain to a manager about the burgers and were comped the milkshake, but were not offered any explanation for the unpleasant burgers.\n\nUnless the standard really improves or unless I can be persuaded otherwise, I will go to one of my regular burger places for my burger fix in future.

This fact became quite evident once we actually received our burgers.\n\nWe decided to go with one of the premade selection, the peppercorn burger, which is coated with peppercorn and dijon mustard and comes with a side of peppercorn. This was ok, I think the judge of a burger place is how well they perform with their basic burger concepts rather than how much fancy stuff you can add on at exorbitant amounts. No offense to the Rossini burger here, which I'm sure is amazing, but if any place decided to put shaved truffles, foie gras, and a wine reduction sauce on top of their burger I can't imagine those flavors not being superior to the rest of the menu, which is why I don't use that as my yardstick. \n\nThe sliders were miniscule (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=_pypfetOujQo-zkiJl60EA), probably the smallest I've ever seen. I barely got much of a taste of any of the 3 different types, and as a result they all tasted pretty much the same. The fries here are also forgettable, another shock at a place with this pedigree.\n\nProbably the biggest upside for me about Burger Bar was the custom milkshake options, because you can get essentially anything you've ever wanted in a milkshake added in, at least in the way of unhealthy chocolate-based products. I decided to go all dark with a mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake with chunks of skor bar, hazelnut mousse and homemade chocolate whipped cream. The consistency was perfect, and all the ingredients harmonious, a truly great milkshake.\n\nThe beef float paddle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=jUMkja8RKqLkuci_WD6BXw) was much less impressive, providing a subpar offering of beer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=cWPFhwGF7wEas3Lgcmpk9A) with ice cream floats which could barely handle their opposing flavors. The only one I really like was the Lindemans and vanilla ice cream combo, mainly because if you add Framboise to just about anything it tastes great. Other than that the Beamish and the Eel River were both ok, but the others were entirely too sour.\n\nA final little annoying thing about Burger Bar, the bathrooms were just rancid when I went in. I'm talking like gas station bad, soaked in urine smell.

I love trying out new places to eat and revisiting old places to eat good food. (see Swan Oyster Depot)\n\nHow we ended up at the Burger Bar on the 6th floor of Macy's is still a mystery but it could have been a combination of eating breakfast at the Daily Grill (don't) but we needed Bloody Mary's and beers stat and then the subsequent walking around the city until the Levi's store opened at 11am on Sundays. (c'mon! people need to shop before 11am!)\n\nWhatever the case, we sat at the bar. I think the other reviews refer to the great view--I guess it's cool if you like overlooking the square--we were watching PX90 commercials and old hockey footage at the bar. The beer selection seemed good. I had the lambic, which I get wherever I find it on draught and there were a full side of the menu that listed all the beers they have.\n\nThe service was slow, we weren't asked if we wanted anything until we were there for about 15 minutes...at the bar...on a slow rainy afternoon...\nWe ordered wings, the American Classic for me and Peppercorn Burger for HungryD. \n\n1. The wings were good. I asked for them dry. I know. I know. HungryD likes his smothered in the sauce too but I personally like them cooked and then dipped, by me, in accompanying sauces. I just do. I think it makes for a better wing experience. This way the wing stays crispy and the sauce stays kinda cold and gives it a nice dippy taste. Shrug. The wings came out steaming (yum!) and the hot sauce was tangy and good.\n\n2. Subsequently about 2 seconds after our appetizers came out. (Yes, I said 2 SECONDS), they brought us our burgers. I saw the bartender give the runner a look that said, \"OH HECK, but i JUST brought out their appies...what should..I...uh...\" Well, the runner made the executive decision to bring us our burgers anyways. Eh, I didn't really mind, although it would have been nice to at least have a moment or two alone with the wings so I could give them the mouth time they deserved.\n\n3. Fries were cold. gross. It came out in mini-fry baskets...they were the thin kind and they were cold. UGH. that's all I can say. \n\n4. The burger was okay. There was lots of meat that tasted good. The bacon that came with it was kinda crispish and the lettuce/tomato looked the way they were supposed to and you get a pickle spear. Not bad but not worth the $15 it cost for me to eat it. HungryD's burger? $17ish or so and he didn't look so impressed either. I guess we could have just shared the kobe/foie gras burger they have for $80 and at least had bragging rights or some sort of cool story to tell. Nope, just some cold fries and a pretty mediocre experience.\n\nSo...overall?\n\nI guess if you're there for the view and you like the novelty of eating in a department store, this might be the place for you.

Was it the best burger i've ever had? No.\n2. Was it a good burger? Sure.\n3. Is the price/potential wait worth this good, but not perfect burger? No.\n\nFor those who are satisfied with my quick statements, ciao and thanks for visiting my review! For those who crave the whys and whats, here are the details entailed in the style of my usual reviews:\n\nI came in to Burger Bar at SF with mild expectations. I say mild because I have heard through word-of-mouth that this burger joint has long lines, overpriced food, and food that is \"eh.\" Nonetheless, on a beautiful day in SF where I couldn't think of where to eat in Union Square for an early dinner (5pm), my gf and I decided to try Burger Bar, considering we don't have to fight a crowd at the this early bird time. \n\nFood:\n\nEntree(s): note about their entrees - most of the regular burgers (black angus, kobe, etc) do not come with fries. They must be ordered on the side. However, certain \"signature chef burgers,\" such as the Hubert Keller Burger, Rossini Burger, etc. come with fries. All burgers, however, come with the basics: lettuce, tomatoes, pickle. You also have a choice of buns, including plain, sesame, onion, ciabatta, sourdough, and wholewheat. \n\nAmerican Kobe Beef Burger: I decided to forego the fancy ingredient burgers and get the simple Kobe Beef burger so I can get a true, uninterrupted sampling of Chef  Keller's creations. I opted for the ciabatta bun and added avocado and an order of zucchini fries on the side. \n\nBurgers at upscale establishments such as this tend to shape their meat patties in a similar fashion: a smaller in circumference, but thicker patty. My American Kobe was just like that. Cooked exactly as I wanted it (medium well). I decided to skip the condiments to first get a real taste of the burger. I must say i was not that impressed with the flavor. The patty, though cooked perfectly, could not differentiate itself from  the flavor of any other meat patty i've had in the past, from backyard bbqs to other restaurants. I suppose the only difference I could taste was that the meat was moist and not dry. Given that, flavor was lacking and preferred the patty to be more seasoned. Could I tell it was Kobe? No.\n\nMy gf opted to treat herself to one of Hubert's more extravagant creations: Surf & Turf Burger. Black angus beef, grilled half lobster, asparagus, on a plain bun. Sounds to die for right? I almost wanted to get it myself but thought the combination of flavors would make it hard for me to appreciate just the meat patty. Fortunately for myself, I still got a hearty sampling of my gf's burger.\n\nTo my utter surprise, there was the same lack of flavor in the Surf/Turf burger. The lobster, though cooked perfectly (moist, but not undercooked) was also unseasoned. The black angus beef and lobster combination did not really blend for me. There was two separate ingredients put into a burger, but the combination just didn't add up. Same story: cooked well, but not flavorful enough. \n\nService:\n\nHard to review as it was a casual dining experience, but I can say our waitress did what was expected of her, gave us our food promptly, refilled our drinks, and was polite and friendly. No complaints. I also wanted to note that this establishment is notorious for the wait on a normal night and that I cannot attest to that since, as mentioned earlier, I came here at a very early time (5pm). \n\nOverall, unimpressed. Good food, but not great. Not worth the bill (our check was around 75 total for two people). I guess it was an experience to try, but I wish the flavor was there.

This burger was really made out of a cold donut bun, strawberry tomatoes, mint leaf lettuce, passion fruit jelly cheese and a chocolate ganache patty. It tasted interesting.

The juiciness of the burger was just awesome! The caramelized onions were just falling out of the ciabatta buns! The blue cheese was so pungent, yet so delicious. The Hubert Keller burger was so flavorful- it was down right amazing.\n\nMy Girlfriend purchased a Buffalo Burger- which tasted great as well! I had a few bites, each seemingly more tender than the last. You can really taste the difference between the Angus beef and the Buffalo beef.\n\nOn top of this- they serve really unique milkshakes such as Nutella and Twinkie flavors. Plus, they have a really huge selection of beer and wine. My jaw dropped when i saw their beer list! I ended up picking some random pilsener from Germany I'd never heard of- that's always fun lol.\n\nI really do plan on coming back to Burger Bar soon. I might not drop $20 on a burger again since i'm sure the quality of their lower priced burger is just as great! Who knows, i might get crazy and throw some black truffles or some foie gras- or heck, even lobster on my burger.

But, as I was warned by my sister, the burger was severely over cooked.  There was hardly a shade of pink anywhere to be found in the meat; it was medium-well at best.  I'll grant that I really prefer a really rare steak, but medium rare is the standard doneness for steaks and only slightly less the norm for burgers.  I've had buffalo several times before, both in burger and steak form, the latter being one of my favorite things to cook, so I know what to expect.  It's kind of a delicate meat that requires attentive care during preparation that this piece was not afforded. The flavors were okay, but were obviously marred by being woefully over cooked.  \n\nHad this been a less expensive burger without the staff touting about how wonderful everything was going to be, and the care they take, I would not feel the need to be as critical.

"], "author": "Tudor J.", "review": "I don't think Mr. Keller cares at all about Burger Bar... to wit, he has not acknowledged or responded to the following:\n\n\nMr. Keller-\n\nI just left a review of Burger Bar SF on Yelp... in it, I promised you a letter to be delivered at Fleur de Lys on Sutter.  This is that letter.  I feel compelled to let you know that I had the WORST experience of my dining life the other day at Burger Bar.\n\nMy friend and I walked in at around 4:00pm and after being promptly seated, my friend left for the restroom.  Shortly after he left, the server approached the table and asked if I had decided on my drink.  I pointed out that my friend was returning shortly and that I would wait for him to place my own order, but that water would be welcome.  My friend returned.  Five minutes later the water arrived.  A few minutes after that the waiter arrived with a blank look on his face and simply stood next to the table, saying nothing.  I picked up on his passive approach and said that not only did we know our drink order, but that the time we were left alone had afforded us time to decide on our burger choices.  I don't know why, but his silence was accompanied by a rather sour look upon his face.  My friend ordered the daily special (Union Square Burger), cooked medium-well, and a root beer.  I ordered the daily special, cooked medium, with fat fries, and a root beer; two exceedingly straightforward, easy orders.  Presumably a burger with a slice of cheese on it is no sweat for the kitchen.  Presumably a kitchen that cooks burgers all day long knows the difference between medium and medium-well... I would presume to believe this, especially in a restaurant bearing your name, Mr. Keller.  \n\nWhen the burgers arrived, my friend and I eagerly got started.  Neither of us had ever tried Burger Bar before, but both are fans of Fleur de Lys, and of you as a chef, Mr. Keller.  Clearly, our expectations were running high.\n\nMy burger was WAY PAST well-done.  It was grey as concrete in the middle and hard as a hockey puck.  My friend's burger was as I had pictured mine, on the pink side of medium, but certainly not as he had ordered, medium-well.\n\nWhen the waiter arrived at the table after a few bites to check on the burgers, it was with some hesitation that I asked him to look at both burgers and then told him that I believed that my friend had been served my burger and that the burger on my bun had been left on the grill for far too long.  How could he explain it?  At first, the young man was extremely defensive; this was followed (and made worse) by him arguing that my friend's burger was a perfect medium-well (despite the fact that it was a nice pink inside and had juices flowing out onto the plate) and that mine was well-done, as I had requested.  With his bad attitude, he failed to understand that your name would be dragged into the experience.  How could a Hubert Keller burger be so far from edible?  In any case, he plaintively looked at my friend, then at me, and slithered away from the table meekly, with a barely audible apology escaping his lips as he left.\n\nHe next showed up a good five minutes after we had stopped eating.  All the while, I was amazed that my burger was so grey, and so hard, but I ate it all the same.  I am not a huge fan of waste, so I would not have asked him to throw the burger away and build me a new one.  He should have at least offered to do so; he should have at least comped one of the burgers, if not both, or comped a free dessert, or offered a manager, or offered a gift certificate to come back again, or done SOMETHING other than sheepishly ignoring us the minute he realized we were not happy.  When he arrived at the table and looked at my plate, which I had emptied mindlessly because I was both starving and seething, he asked how the burger was.  I said to him, quite bluntly, \"This was the worst burger I have ever eaten.\"  He looked at my empty plate, then back at me, and said, \"Oh, I can see that... you must have hated it.\"  I replied, \"I don't find this funny.  I ate the whole thing fast because it was terrible and I was starving and you didn't offer to make it right, and you ignored our table.  All I want to do now is leave!\"  He was floored.  He obviously was not prepared for this.  \"What can I do?\" he stammered.  \"Now?  Not a whole lot.  That was by far the worst burger I have ever eaten, and now I want nothing more than to get out of here.\"  I was repeating myself to this obviously untrained kid, and he was making me repeat myself again, and again, and again.  I told him pointblank that I wanted him to do SOMETHING to rectify the situation.  He had no idea what to do.  He fumbled with something in his hands and finally said, \"I'll get a manager.\"  Did he not hear me say I wanted to leave, in a hurry?  I wanted to see the manager, so that was correct, but I would expect a manager to come over quickly.

I opted for the Hubert Keller burger (his favorite apparently) and was a bit disappointed. I guess I had high expectations since it was his favorite. The buffalo patty was nice and tender, but it being buffalo, medium meant it was a little pinker than medium for beef. This isn't a big deal, but just bear it in mind if you order medium for buffalo. I've read some of the other reviews down below and people were complaining that they're burger came out too pink, ahem, this might be why so just take it into consideration. I was expecting this burger to be just as wonderful as I remembered when I tried it for the first time with the Burger Bar Sliders, however the caramelized onions didn't play a major role in the Hubert Keller Burger like it did in the sliders. Also, the blue cheese was over powering. Many have pointed out the playfulness in Hubert Keller and one of my favorite things here is the milkshake paddle. For $20 bucks you get six small milkshake glasses (three flavors: Strawberry, Caramel latte, and Nutella) on a paddle. A very good deal if you ask me considering that one regular milkshake already costs $8.75.

It's also priced that way, meaning it's a bit expensive for burger and fries, but what do you expect.  There's nothing SF-unique about it and it's almost got an upscale-city-version of Chilis feel.

Horrible service (this is a deal breaker for me most of the time). Our first waiter didn't want anything to do with us (maybe it was because he was ending his shift; still not an excuse). It was hard to flag him down and when we did; he got our order wrong (could've been his \"walk and listen\" method that didn't work. yes. he didn't even stop to listen to our order. the d-bag kept walking). After we couldn't find him for a good ten minutes; we asked someone for something simple -  a straw - but never got it. Then we got pleasantly surprised with a new waitress. Definitely better than our first - bubbly, attentive, and willing. Things were smooth until the place got busier. After a while we never saw our waitress so it took forever to get anything. When we tried to flag her down she gave us the index finger. So we tried to ask someone to pass on the message that we wanted some tea... when that didn't come after 15 minutes we were able to finally get her attention and she said she never got the message and that she'd make sure the tea would make its way to our table - never happened. Finally, she came back after another ten minutes, after we had to flag her down of course, and told us they had no more of the tea we wanted.. went to the fourth floor for some tea instead.

We arrived at approximately 6pm and were told the wait would take about 10 minutes since they weren't seating anyone yet.  After waiting about 10 minutes, another group showed up and was told the wait would take about an hour.  Frustrated, I asked the hostess about our wait and she looked on her small white note sheet and said we're number 14 in line and it will take an hour.  We noticed a small group arriving way after us and asking for a table for two and were seated right away.  The lady in that group was chatting with hostess and telling her what a great job she's doing and to just ignore all the negative comments from the impatient people waiting to her right.  If I knew I had to kiss up to hostess for a faster table, I would have done the same.  A group next to us saw what happened and left very upset over how unprofessional the hostess was acting.\n\nWhen we finally got seated after an hour and 10 minutes wait, we only saw our waitress three times during the entire evening.  I never got her name since she never introduced herself.  We first saw her when she dropped off our waters and took our order.  We never saw her again until my boyfriend noticed her walking by and asked for the check.  I did mention to her that the service was really slow and she replied by saying \"it's opening night\".  Her final visit was dropping off the receipt and we promptly paid our bill in cash so we wouldn't have to wait any longer for her to return.  \n\nIn terms of the food, my boyfriend was satisfied with his Hubert Keller Burger, but my burger was anything but desirable.  I ordered the Angus beef and the patty was falling apart as I bit into it.  The pesto sauce had a very rusty oily taste to it which made the burger very hard to eat.  Additionally, my fries were very over salted and my pepsi was flat. \n  \nI completely understand that opening nights are a bit tricky, but our complete dining experience was horrible.  I wouldn't have mind the wait if the service or food was better.  I have been to the Burger Bar in Las Vegas and very impressed with the food and service.  I even made reservations for Fleur De Lys for my boyfriend's birthday dinner because he is such a big fan of Hubert Keller.  We were both very disappointed with our dining experience.

They did assure me that there will be plenty of tables to accommodate our party and true to their word, we were seated promptly upon our arrival.\n\nThe infinite number of burger combinations was too overwhelming for me so I ended up ordering the Burger Bar Sliders.  The buffalo with caramelized onions was definitely my favorite.  I've never had buffalo meat before until today and knowing how lean it is, I half-expected it to be dry but contrarily, it was was moist and juicy.  The Angus beef with bacon was pretty good too but the Country Natural beef was nothing special at all.  I subbed the skinny fries with sweet potato fries and those were pretty yummy ~ not greasy at all.\n\nMost of the people in my party seemed to enjoy their burgers as well, with the exception of one person who ordered the Chef's Veggie Burger (with lentils, peas, brown and white rice, etc...doesn't sound appetizing at all).  But then again, who would expect that to be good?  If you are a vegetarian/vegan, then you are probably better off with the Vegas Vegan (with grilled zucchini, eggplant, tomato and peppers sandwiched between two portabella mushrooms), as another coworker who ordered it said it was delish.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Milkshake Sampler Paddle, which consisted of two chocolate, two coffee and two strawberry shakes.  I had the coffee one, which was really yummy.  I tried it before mixing in the caramel on the side and the chocolate syrup in the bottom of the glass and liked it better without them as it made the shake too thick.\n\nOverall, pretty good meal.  Service was okay...nothing spectacular.  Expect to pay around $15 or so for a burger.  For those who have the money to splurge, you can try the Rossini for $60 which has Kobe beef with foie gras and shaved truffles.  I would love to come back for their buffalo burger and to try their chocolate burger as well.

It was conveniently located inside the huge Macy's at Union Square.  At 6:00 P.M., my friend and I only had to wait 5 minutes before being seated in the bar area.  We had a great view of the Christmas tree, ice skaters, and holiday lights outside, but it was dark, crowded, and noisy inside.  The music and and noise level was so high it gave me a headache.  As I walked to the restroom in the back of the restaurant, I noticed the booths had TVs on the enclosed end.  When we got to the restaurant, I was planning on having the $60 Kobe burger with foie gras, shaved truffles, and truffle sauce, but opted for a less extravagant meal.  There are several specialty burgers to choose from, but there is also the option of getting a plain burger and loading it up with a variety of toppings, including cheese, vegetables (both raw and cooked), other meats (bacon, foie, prosciutto), etc.  My friend chose the $12.75 Burger Bar Sliders with skinny fries.

And so sadly, and honestly, I've really had better burgers.\n\nWhere BB could have been better:\n- More preset combos: While custom designing your own burger can be cool, BB should offer more pre-set designs. Why? Because it guarantees a tasty combo. \n\nOur group opted to venture out on our own creation. American Kobe with Avocado ($16.50 + $1.55) on sesame bun. While the meat was cooked just right (medium - still pink in center) and the kobe was tender, it lacked flavor. You would have needed a couple of other toppings to make the burger taste more interesting. Otherwise, it's just ground meat.\n\nWe also tried the Salmon Steak ($8.50) on wheat. It was really boring. With no added toppings, it was doomed to dry failure. \n\n- Need softer buns: Ok, what's the point of choosing the type of buns, if they all are overly thick (out of proportion with the meat) and dry. I expected super fresh buns, toasted and soft. These were not. We ended up tossing the buns aside, and not for carb reasons.\n\n- Need Experienced Service: Maybe it was an off day, but we got a server who didn't seem to know how to take orders or remember what we ordered. Again, for an establishment with HK's name on it, we expected the best and it wasn't.\n\nWhat Made it Bearable:\n- Plenty of seating: We came just before 7p on a weeknight. Had no problems securing a table. No waiting is a plus.\n- Rockin milkshakes. We split the black and white shake and it was very tasty. Thick rich vanilla ice cream blended with oreos made this a delicious favorite.\n- Burger Bar Sliders ($12.75): You get a tasting of 3 meat - Buffalo with caramelized onions (good tasting meat complemented by the sweet onions), Angus w/ bacon (anything is better with bacon), and Natural beef w/ cheese (anything is better with cheese). It's a great way to taste the different meats and with a touch of paired topping. And the order comes with fries of your choice, while the a la carte burgers require additional ordering.\n- Cheese Cake Donut ($5.75): Thought this was a creative twist. They take a glazed donut, split in half and sandwich creamy whipped cream cheese in the center with thin slices of pineapple. The \"cheesecake\" center had a tangy note and made a nice contrast to the glazed sugar of the donut. The whipped cream mouse with almond ears and chocolate eyes was cute as it appeared he was chasing down the donut.\n\nOur total tab with additional orders of skinny fries ($3.35) and onion rings ($3.55), 1 milkshake, 1 dessert, 3 burgers, 1 soda came to $26 (with tip) per person.

I was afraid to drink an entire Nutella milkshake by myself, but I took a sip from someone in my party who ordered it, and I got transported to chocolate heaven!  Please find a way to lower the sugar and calorie content in that drink, so I can order it without feeling guilty, otherwise I will just have to content myself with devouring it with my eyes, and you wouldn't want to do that to me, would you?\n\nCan you also please tell me what in the hell your waitresses eat at your restaurant?  Do they even eat at all?  Because they're all pretty skinny, and I know they didn't get that way from your skinny fries.  Maybe they eat your fat fries?  Or only one fat fry?  But can you do me a favor and tell them to improve their customer service because it seems like it takes them a long time to come around and take your order, or check up on you.  Tell them to eat 2 fat fries if that's what it takes.  Oh, and maybe you can expand your restaurant in the near future, too?  When I come with a party of 3 people we're always seated right away, but any bigger than that and I end up waiting 30 minutes or more.  You don't want to keep me away from your burgers that long, now do you?\n\nKeep up the good work, Hubert.

The sliders looked super tiny, but they actually filled me up in the end.  I'd say their portion sizes are just right if you're hungry.\n\nOne of them also got the nutella shake which she let us try. It was really good.  Although, it was $9.00 and you don't get the extra silver cup to refill your glass when you've finished. Sad.  Again, though, if you have the money to spend and don't mind paying, then it's good.\n\nFor dessert, we decided to share two items: the dessert burger and the dessert cheeseburger?  Get the one that does not have chocolate ganache. The one with the cheesecake filling is really good, although the donut could've been less stale... hahha. It was $6.00 for each of the desserts.\n\nSomething cool was that they had a tv in each of the booths.  I see it as both a good and bad thing.. On the one hand, you get to watch exciting sports games, but if you want to have a conversation with someone, it might get too distracting.  I'm not sure if you can choose to turn the tv off... hehe.\nWould I come again? Probably not unless I magically happen to find $40 on the floor, but I would recommend it to my friends who are more financially fortunate than me.\n\nThe wait for a table was about 20-30 minutes for lunch on Friday (new years day 2010). But because you're at macy's, you can browse ...They didn't validate our parking of the Union Square garage... \n\nService was great.

Horrible service (this is a deal breaker for me most of the time). Our first waiter didn't want anything to do with us (maybe it was because he was ending his shift; still not an excuse). It was hard to flag him down and when we did; he got our order wrong (could've been his \"walk and listen\" method that didn't work. yes. he didn't even stop to listen to our order. the d-bag kept walking). After we couldn't find him for a good ten minutes; we asked someone for something simple -  a straw - but never got it. Then we got pleasantly surprised with a new waitress. Definitely better than our first - bubbly, attentive, and willing. Things were smooth until the place got busier. After a while we never saw our waitress so it took forever to get anything. When we tried to flag her down she gave us the index finger. So we tried to ask someone to pass on the message that we wanted some tea... when that didn't come after 15 minutes we were able to finally get her attention and she said she never got the message and that she'd make sure the tea would make its way to our table - never happened. Finally, she came back after another ten minutes, after we had to flag her down of course, and told us they had no more of the tea we wanted.. went to the fourth floor for some tea instead.

Some burgers said they came with them, but most did not. So we ordered a fry sampler and 3 burgers that didn't say it came with fries. Food came and 2 out of the 3 burgers ordered came with fries and additionally we got a fry sampler for $12. Why did the waitress not inform us when we asked about the fries and how many people could share them that 2 of the burgers come with fries? The burgers were pretty good. There's the second star. The waitress wasn't very good or attentive. She did ask if everything was ok but as she was staring at 3 empty drinks.

No fish sticks allowed on this night. \n\nThis was our first time dining here and we all very curious to finally sample and see what all the buzz was about. I had heard all about the $60 dollar burger and was expecting to see some steep pricing, but when opening the menu I found what I would consider some pretty reasonably priced offerings. Sure, there are a couple of burgers that are priced to the point one may consider taking out a home equity line to eat here, but that is the exception.\n\nWe walked in just after six and were immediately seated in the main bar area. Drink orders were taken and within a few minutes and I had a tequila gimlet sitting right in front of me. Alexandra had glass of pinot  which she never really took a liking to, my wife went with a Junipero martini which looked pretty refreshing and Alexandra's boyfriend had some fancy micro brew beer. \n\nAfter a few minutes of browsing the menu we were finally ready to order. Three of us went with the Country Natural which is farm raised beef, my wife however decided to try something a little different and boldly ordered the buffalo burger.

I got something a little more down to earth; something that would let me taste that meaty beefy flavor that I love so much.  I didn't ask, but I would guess that the meat is like an 80/20 mix.  Certainly not any leaner, otherwise you wouldn't have the taste.  \n\nThe Black Jack burger was good.  Done properly, though maybe a little over.  Still tasty and not dry at all.

I've tried 3 of your burgers at Burger Bar now (plus a bite of your $60 burger that my companion ordered), and I've been impressed all 3.5 times.  From the Buffalo Burger, to the American Kobe Beef Burger, to the Hubert Keller Burger, you knocked my socks off! And your skinny fries are excellent, too, but you tease me with the name because ain't no way those fries are going to keep me skinny.  I was afraid to drink an entire Nutella milkshake by myself, but I took a sip from someone in my party who ordered it, and I got transported to chocolate heaven!  Please find a way to lower the sugar and calorie content in that drink, so I can order it without feeling guilty, otherwise I will just have to content myself with devouring it with my eyes, and you wouldn't want to do that to me, would you?\n\nCan you also please tell me what in the hell your waitresses eat at your restaurant?  Do they even eat at all?  Because they're all pretty skinny, and I know they didn't get that way from your skinny fries.  Maybe they eat your fat fries?  Or only one fat fry?  But can you do me a favor and tell them to improve their customer service because it seems like it takes them a long time to come around and take your order, or check up on you.  Tell them to eat 2 fat fries if that's what it takes.  Oh, and maybe you can expand your restaurant in the near future, too?

I was tempted to go for bacon too but thought it would hide the taste of the meat.\n\nYUM - it was a damn good burger. I'm not sure if I've had better actually.

This is that letter.  I feel compelled to let you know that I had the WORST experience of my dining life the other day at Burger Bar.\n\nMy friend and I walked in at around 4:00pm and after being promptly seated, my friend left for the restroom.  Shortly after he left, the server approached the table and asked if I had decided on my drink.  I pointed out that my friend was returning shortly and that I would wait for him to place my own order, but that water would be welcome.  My friend returned.  Five minutes later the water arrived.  A few minutes after that the waiter arrived with a blank look on his face and simply stood next to the table, saying nothing.  I picked up on his passive approach and said that not only did we know our drink order, but that the time we were left alone had afforded us time to decide on our burger choices.

Neither of us had ever tried Burger Bar before, but both are fans of Fleur de Lys, and of you as a chef, Mr. Keller.  Clearly, our expectations were running high.\n\nMy burger was WAY PAST well-done.  It was grey as concrete in the middle and hard as a hockey puck.  My friend's burger was as I had pictured mine, on the pink side of medium, but certainly not as he had ordered, medium-well.\n\nWhen the waiter arrived at the table after a few bites to check on the burgers, it was with some hesitation that I asked him to look at both burgers and then told him that I believed that my friend had been served my burger and that the burger on my bun had been left on the grill for far too long.  How could he explain it?  At first, the young man was extremely defensive; this was followed (and made worse) by him arguing that my friend's burger was a perfect medium-well (despite the fact that it was a nice pink inside and had juices flowing out onto the plate) and that mine was well-done, as I had requested.  With his bad attitude, he failed to understand that your name would be dragged into the experience.  How could a Hubert Keller burger be so far from edible?  In any case, he plaintively looked at my friend, then at me, and slithered away from the table meekly, with a barely audible apology escaping his lips as he left.\n\nHe next showed up a good five minutes after we had stopped eating.  All the while, I was amazed that my burger was so grey, and so hard, but I ate it all the same.  I am not a huge fan of waste, so I would not have asked him to throw the burger away and build me a new one.  He should have at least offered to do so; he should have at least comped one of the burgers, if not both, or comped a free dessert, or offered a manager, or offered a gift certificate to come back again, or done SOMETHING other than sheepishly ignoring us the minute he realized we were not happy.  When he arrived at the table and looked at my plate, which I had emptied mindlessly because I was both starving and seething, he asked how the burger was.  I said to him, quite bluntly, \"This was the worst burger I have ever eaten.\"  He looked at my empty plate, then back at me, and said, \"Oh, I can see that... you must have hated it.\"  I replied, \"I don't find this funny.  I ate the whole thing fast because it was terrible and I was starving and you didn't offer to make it right, and you ignored our table.  All I want to do now is leave!\"  He was floored.  He obviously was not prepared for this.  \"What can I do?\" he stammered.  \"Now?  Not a whole lot.  That was by far the worst burger I have ever eaten, and now I want nothing more than to get out of here.\"  I was repeating myself to this obviously untrained kid, and he was making me repeat myself again, and again, and again.  I told him pointblank that I wanted him to do SOMETHING to rectify the situation.  He had no idea what to do.  He fumbled with something in his hands and finally said, \"I'll get a manager.\"  Did he not hear me say I wanted to leave, in a hurry?

There were a few vegan options, but they included some ingrediants that my friend didn't care for (like eggplant).

Mine was a marginally more daring choice, the $13.75 Black Jack Burger which came with melted jack and a spread of tapenade, all in a ciabatta roll (see photo). I threw caution to the wind and also threw in a $1.25 order of oyster mushrooms on top. Both were seriously delicious with the Black Angus beef fresh and cooked to order. We definitely didn't feel like they were skimping on the ingredients. \n\nThe $3.25 Diet Cokes came with free refills, a big plus, especially on Jamie's checklist (see photo).

Thanks again Simone for organizing!\n\nThe restaurant set up a super long table for us just beside the bar which made it easier for the beer drinkers to get their brew on.  I was anticipating a call to return to work so I decided to stay beer-free that night and just sipped on the glass of ice water that was provided shortly after I was seated.  I don't drink beer too often anyway, but I often do so in a social setting.\n\nThe name, Hubert Keller, does nothing for me.  Sorry Mr. Keller!  I work nights, I watch very little television and I rarely follow the culinary arts.  Simply put I had zero expectations for this restaurant knowing only that I had read many mediocre reviews judging this Keller dude and his new restaurant simply on expectations.\n\nThe menu is kind of busy and confusing.  Thank goodness I was sitting next to Fong L who had already been here before.  It helps to have someone to help navigate a confusing menu.  Basically one page had burgers all thought out by the kitchen and the opposite page gave you the chance to build your own burger item by item with a specific cost for each item.  I decided to take the easier route, but I was happy to learn that it was okay to add items to the \"pre-designed\" burgers.\n\nAfter a bit of waiting for folks to arrive and get settled in the round of ordering began.  Other people at the table had already ordered milkshakes with the drink orders, and those darn things looked good.  After checking my pocket to make sure I had a supply of my trusty Lactaid Fast Act tablets I went ahead and ordered the alcoholic version of the mint chocolate chip milkshake.  My burger of choice was the American Classic (Black Angus beef, American cheese, bacon, tomato, onion on a seeded bun).  I ordered the beef cooked medium and had a fried egg added onto it.\n\nI was too busy listening in on conversations when my big milkshake arrived, beautifully assembled with liquid already oozing down the side of the glass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=RMY1PNJ8Evaz_V1tqSURaQ).  My photo doesn't capture its awesome beauty well enough.  I hope Fong and Simone got better pics of it.  The shake consisted of mint chip ice cream, hot fudge, mint liqueur, chocolate whipped cream, big chocolate chips and an Oreo cookie.  Oh my!!  This was so good!  The chocolate whipped cream was nice and fluffy yet light as ever with very good chocolate flavor.  The shake itself was thick too.  I can honestly say that I could not taste the liqueur but no doubt this was one of the most incredible milkshakes I've ever enjoyed.\n\nThe food service coming out from the kitchen was a bit spotty.  I was among the first at our table to get my burger, but others at our table waited a long time after our food arrived to get theirs.  The burger came with a side of Skinny Fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=Xe7cyB5ko5EmFbsQYj8ATg).  The fries were very generic, but I liked the burger very much.  I forgot to take a photo of the inside of the burger, but my beef was more of a medium rare than it was medium.  The beef had good flavor and it was fresh tasting so I really didn't mind the rareness of the burger.  The quality definitely shows; although, I wished they used a sturdier bun.  The fried egg was one of perfection cooked just below over medium with the yolk just beginning to cook yet having a nice liquid center to ooze out onto the beef.  The bacon was thick and flavorful.\n\nThey brought us complimentary desserts too in the form of their chocolate burgers and cream cheese burgers which looked fun.  I only sampled a bit of the chocolate one which had a thick chocolate ganache burger, a glazed donut bun and some exciting passion fruit flavored gelle that acted as the cheese.\n\nWhen it came down to settling the bill the restaurant had everything already separated based on individual seat locations so determining who owed what was an absolute breeze.  I wish more restaurants would do that for large groups.  That alone helps me to boost my rating up to a 4.  \n\nI'd like to return to try the Kobe beef and more outrageous ice cream concoctions, but until then I'm very happy to have attended this Burger Bar outing.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Had an order of skinny fries which were also good.

"], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "So, as some of you who read my reviews already know, I recently went through a five month stretch of eating zero/almost zero beef (side note #1: even after all this time, I still find it weird that I might have \"regular\" readers.  Assuming I do though, you guys are great!).  Though it didn't end up to being as tortuous as I had feared (once I got past the initial withdrawals), there were still a few times that I had some serious burger cravings (side note #2: if you read the opening to my Serpentine review, you'll get how bad I wanted one at that point).  So, with my beef ban over, what better way to celebrate than to go out and get some BURGERS?\n\nWhen our party of three showed up on a Friday around 7:30, we were pleasantly surprised to get seated immediately.  No wait on a Friday night for dinner?  Score!  Table with a mini-TV airing the Giants game?  Double score!  After skimming through their menu, I decided to try my hand at creating my own concoction instead of getting one of their specialty burgers.  After all, with their wealth of ingredients, how could you not be tempted?  So, after some careful consideration, I opted to go with a Black Angus burger on an onion bun with slices of provolone and pepper jack cheese, jalapeno bacon, and, of course, a fried egg.  Along with a Brown Cow milkshake (vanilla ice cream and hot fudge topped with chocolate whipped cream) and baskets of Skinny Fries and Buttermilk Onion Rings we all decided to share, this certainly wasn't a healthy sort of meal.  Dieters beware.\n\nWhen our food was brought out, it looked quite appetizing.  Maybe my cravings had something to do with it, but not much time passed between when the plate met the table and when the burger met my mouth.  The verdict?  Solid, but not life altering.  I liked that the patty wasn't too thick, had some beefy flavor, and was cooked exactly to medium as ordered.  On the flip though, the bun didn't taste like onion to me, though that's probably because everything else in the burger blocked it out.  The combination of cheeses didn't work out too well as the tastes got muddled together, but that's more my fault for doubling up than theirs.  My favorite part was their jalapeno bacon - though it wasn't as spicy as I hoped, it was still flavorful.  And the egg?  Well, who doesn't love a fried egg?  Definitely added to the burger, but it also made it a lot messier to eat as well.\n\nAs for their fries and onion rings, I liked both - crispy, but not oily.  Neither are the best I've had (side note #3: the fries tasted great with the truffle sauce), but both are good companions for your burger.  As for the milkshake, I was a little conflicted.  Outside of it being a little too sweet, I thought it was good.  However, I was disappointed that it didn't come with the excess amount in the metal tin cup like at other places.  I understand that it might not be classy and that they probably measure out exact portions, but at $9.00, it'd be nice to have a little more than just that tall glass to sip on.\n\nDespite hearing only modest praise from friends and fellow Yelpers, Burger Bar was always a \"must try\" given Hubert Keller's reputation.  I could see why people haven't been overwhelmed by their experiences, but I wouldn't say it was a disappointment either.  It's certainly not the best burger in the city, but it's still pretty decent (side note #4: where else would you find a burger that's built around Kobe beef and foie gras?).  I'd say 3.5 stars is about right, but rounding up to four stars since I was in a good mood that night.

You kind of feel like you are in a sports bar yet you still have plenty of privacy to enjoy a laid back dinner amongst friends and family.

"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Being an avid Top Chef Fan, I was so excited to go to Burger Bar after hearing they serve Kobe beef and foie gras. After seeing mixed reviews on YELP, I wanted to wait a bit hoping they would iron out their wrinkles. After several weeks later, I just couldn't wait...was it worth the wait? ABOSULTELY NOT! I have to say I AGREE with all the negative reviews regarding Burger Bar's food quality, pricing, and service. \n\nMy friend and I came here on a Monday night around 6:10 p.m. We waited for about 5 minutes before we were seated. Upon walking to our booth, I was shockingly surprised about how mundane the d\u00e9cor was. More on d\u00e9cor later.\n\nFOOD:\n*Kobe Burger w/ Foie Gras and Swiss Cheese on an Onion Bun: The Kobe was very meh. I have had Kobe several times before and I have to say I agree with all the other YELPERS who say it tasted exactly like ground beef. The Kobe wasn't seasoned properly and therefore lacked flavor. I requested the Kobe be cooked MEDIUM, but it was WELL-DONE. \n\nOk, while the Foie Gras and Kobe sounds like a good combo in theory; it didn't pair well together. Because the patty was substantially larger as compared to the foie gras; it got lost in the patty. The only thing it did to the burger was add a salty oily flavor to it. \n\n*Skinny Fries w/ Chili Aioli Sauce: The fries were ok; I would say something to comparable to McD's fries minus the salt. They would have probably tasted better if they were hot versus lukewarm. There was NO kick or heat in the chili aioli sauce. It looked and tasted like colored mayo.\n\n*Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Nutella and homemade whip cream: They claim their ice cream to be homemade? I'm guessing that's why it took 33 minutes to get our ice cream! The ice cream was just average; there was nothing that really stood out about it. \n\nPRICING: Build your burger concept...pick your patty which ranges in prices. Then if you want to add cheese, grilled onions, veggies, condiments (i.e. Dijon mustard), etc, there's a separate charge. \n\nMy Kobe w/ Foie Gras and Swiss Cheese came out to be about $30. Fries were an additional $3.35. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was nice; however, once we first seated, she was anxious to get our orders. And, after we received our food, she was no where to be found. It took about 25-30 minutes to get our burgers. After eating out burgers, we decided to order dessert. After 20 minutes of waiting for our ice cream, we flagged down the waitress to cancel our order. She said they were running behind schedule, and that they were preparing it right now. Another 10 minutes passes, and nothing. We asked again to cancel the order and to just get the bill. She apologized and said the Manager will comp the ice cream and they were making it now. After waiting a total of 33 minutes, we finally got it. Unless you're churning the ice cream as we speak, it should NOT take that long to scoop ice cream and pour some nutella sauce on it. \n\nD\u00c9COR/AMBIANCE: Ummm, if you're going to serve burgers ranging from $15-$60, you better have a decor that's more extravagant than the typical Sports Bar and Grill which pretty much sums it up. Cheesecake's d\u00e9cor puts Burger Bar's d\u00e9cor to shame. Sad...And, what is up with the TVs in the booths? It was very distracting especially when trying to hold a conversation. So yah, fellas, not a good date place. \n\nCROWD: Tourists, tourists, and more tourists. I guess they should be thankful that they're located in a prime location. \n\nWe were able to see Chef Hubert Keller walking around the restaurant, hence the 2 stars. Would have been a nice touch if he made an effort to reach out to the patrons...\n\nTo sum it all up, I was disappointed with my experience at Burger Bar and highly doubt I would return, nor would I recommend it to anyone. There's far better places to get a burger that's more reasonable (e.g. Bullshead, Barney's, etc).

However, as a Georgia girl raised on a cattle farm, I can really appreciate a well-crafted burger and I do not find comfort in (for example) the ground shrimp concoctions that are taking the place of an all-beef patty on certain trendy menus. This being said, I was excited to visit Chef Hubert Keller's Burger Bar while I was staying in San Francisco this past month; it certainly did not hurt that my hotel was in eye-sight of the Macy's in which Burger Bar is located. My classmate, who works as a Chef in her own state, is just as much of a burger freak as I am and was thrilled at the idea of stopping in on our way back to the hotel from our romp around the Ferry Building. Upon checking-in with the hostess we were told to expect a 15 minute wait and were satisfied that we only had to stall for about 7 or 8 minutes. Even better, we were seated next to a window overlooking Union Square so that we could enjoy the beautiful day outside from our comfortable perch 6 stories up.\n\nWalking the hills again had re-whetted my appetite and thirst so I started my order with a Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen while Robin went for a flight of sampler pours including the Pyramid Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Pyramid Outburst Imperial IPA and the privately-labeled Burger Bar Brew. Robin seemed to enjoy getting to taste so many options and I thoroughly enjoyed my wheat beer; it was the perfect weather for this light, slightly yeasty wheat beer. Before we could make up our minds on burgers (there are SO many options to either pick a composed burger or to create your own from endless choices) we picked out an appetizer to split. The Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles were something to behold and provided the perfect combination of slightly pickled, flavorful heat and substantial batter to absorb the spicy juices and create a rich, yet slightly crisp, exterior. The chipotle aioli that accompanied the jalapeno fries provided just enough creaminess to balance the heat; I cannot see ordering these gems with any other sauce offered on the menu. Finally, as if the fun flavors were not enough, the battered peppers were served in a cute miniature fry-basket; this was a first in presentation for me!\n\nMulling over the menu while I munched on jalapenos helped to inspire my customized burger and Robin and I agreed that we were ready to place our next order just as our waitress approached. I was allowed to order first and chose a toasted onion bun as my base, the sustainable Country Natural burger (cooked mid-rare), caramelized onion and pan-seared foie gras for my add-ons and the rich red wine and shallot reduction as my sauce. After placing my order I guess Robin decided to simplify things and just asked for one of the same, right down to the skinny fries with a classic aioli. Despite my longing for the $60 Rossini Burger (a Kobe creation oozing black truffles and foie gras) I was thrilled with my own composition and I am comfortable to say that this ranked in my top five favorite burgers and is kept company by the Black Tie Burger of Minetta Tavern in Manhattan and the 10 O'clock Burger of Holeman & Finch in Atlanta (In-N-Out holds a spot near the top as well, but for totally different reasons). The burger was perfectly cooked and rich without being fatty and the foie gras added a beautiful element of creamy caramelization and decadence (gotta get your fix of California foie gras before July 1st!). The shallot reduction was the perfect finish to the structure and the fries were an excellent accompaniment without being too starchy, yet still satisfying.\n\nI will go back to Burger Bar again next time that I am on the west coast and would definitely check out Chef Keller's Las Vegas Burger Bar location next time I am in Sin City.

The Hubert Keller burger is supposedly the signature burger named after the founder and owner of Burger Bar. I stole a sweet potato fry from my friend's plate was amazed how sweet and crispy it was. My Hubert Keller burger was pretty interesting spinach and cheese topped  it came with a side of sauce that I topped onto my meat. I asked for a medium rare burger and it was perfectly done, the sauce actually did kind cooked parts of my meat through. The ciabatta bread is nicely toasted it got a lil soggy from the sauce I poured over my meat. The spinach was nicely cooked and it's a uniquely accompanied helping the to the burger.

With 5 beerfloats to sample, we were elated. I'm not a big beer drinker, but of course curiosity got the best of me.  My favorite of all of them was the Raspberry Velvet. It was sweeter and the ice cream and berry beer seem to mesh better rather than the strawberry ice cream and pale ale float (that one had a sweet/savory thing going on. Still good though!) There was one float you should stay away from. I'm not sure about the name, but it was the only minty one. So when you get to one that tastes like mint, set that one aside, or cover it with a napkin. Do what you can to forget about it. \n\nThe 1-star visit? Let's just say\nHorrible service, even though it was dead in there: Monday night, hour before closing. I and a few friends did a round of beer floats that were late and practically thrown at us. \n\nVeggie burger was very tasty, but again, slow service with not a smile. but with more of an irritated grimace. \n\nDessert? Why not a burger again!? The Dessert burger had a krispy kreme-esque donut bun, nutella & chopped hazelnut \"patty\", strawberries, kiwi, and a mango jelly \"cheese slice\". All together, the components of this dessert were good. If you're a fan of dessert mash-ups, like ice cream sandwiches you'll like this. Some of my friends disagreed, and would have opted for just the nutella patty, making it a protein style dessert burger.   \n\nOverall:\nPros - Go at an earlier hour, where the servers are at a better disposition. Sit by the window, if there are no window seats, leave, or get really drunk off beer floats.

Unless you order the Chef's Burgers, i.e. American Classic Burger ($14.50)  Black Angus Beef, American Cheese, Bacon, Tomato, Onions on Sesame Bun.\n\nI chose the Skinny Fries($3.35) to add with my Kobe Burger.  My order came as I had requested medium-rare.  Unlike, Sha M's review, my meat did not have any gristle and it was very tender and flavorable.  I was disappointed with the skinny fries though.  It wasn't even warm, I surmise it was sitting around for awhile.\n\nOn my next visit, I plan to order Surf & Turf Burger ($24.50) Black Angus, Grilled Half Lobster, Grilled Green Aparagus on a plain bun.

I was a little anxious because it was a) in Macys, which I hate going into for so many reasons, b) they don't take reservations (is it that hard to keep a reservation book?), and c) we were going to be there at 7:00 on a Saturday night during the holidays.  But the promise of good meat and milkshakes spurred me on in spite of it all.\n\nWhen we arrived we heeded a fellow yelper's advice to avoid the elevator...it takes forever and people really jam themselves in there!  So we scurried up the escalators without any problems.  We checked in and were told that the wait was 45 to 60 min.  So we wandered about the china and glassware department to make fun of the crap they sell at Macys...really, who buys a casarole dish with a lid shaped like a bunny?!?!  After a while we just loitered near the door and listened for our party of 6 to be called.  To our surprise, we were seated in about 30 minutes.  WOW!  Didn't see that coming.\n\nWe got a nice table right in front of the milkshake bar.  Our orders were taken promptly and our drinks came out before we knew it.  My caramel latte shake was fantastic.  Very smooth and creamy...not  a super thick consistency that requires vacuum suction to get up the straw.  My only complaint is that for an $8 shake, the portion could have been more generous.\n\nOur food came to us fairly quickly.  The food itself was good.  Not out of this world, but not bad either.  I mean, they're burgers!  I had the sliders and they were tasty, nicely presented and filling.  They came with skinny fries that were good, but I have had better.  My friends had a variety of burgers:  buffalo, angus, kobe.  Again, all very good.  One person thought her burger was a little over cooked, but the truffle sauce more than made up for it.  The sides were pretty good, too.  The sweet potato fries were great and so were the onion rings.  The fried zucchini were good and even better dipped in the aioli.  My friends reported that the fried pickles were a bit disappointing...I didn't try them myself because, well, they were fried pickles.  eeww.  \n\nI will definitely want to come back to try some other things on the menu.  The Peppercorn cream sauce was calling to me.  As was the Surf & Turf Burger (a burger with half a lobster on it...HALF A LOBSTER!!!)\n\nAs for price, yes, it's very spendy.  But when you go to a place like that, what do you expect?!  It's in Macy's for godssakes!  You're paying for the Hubert Keller name, the view and all the fluff.  But I think people have overlooked the fact that you are also paying for some quality ingredients that go into these burgers (even though they are just burgers).  Foie Gras and truffles ain't cheap (but they are oh, so good!).\n\nOur server was a very nice young woman who checked on us often and was not judging as we greedily slurped up our truffle sauce.  A small troop of servers helped her bring our food to us so it all hit the table at the same time:  one of my standards of excellent service.\n\nWill I go back to Burger Bar?  Yes (remember, half a lobster!).  Will I go there often, No.  It's a good place to go, but it's definitely a special occasion kind of thing.  I LOVE burgers and there lots of good places all over the Bay Area to get tasty \"everyday\"  burgers.  But when I get a craving for something fancy and special, I will bite the bullet and step into Macys to get to Burger Bar.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-01-05"}, {"excerpts": ["This is what we ordered:\n\nKobe Burger with Sweet Potato Fries (19.85)\nBurger Sliders with Skinny Fries (12.75)\nKobe Burger with Pepper Jack (17.45)\n"], "author": "Nina M.", "review": "When you have limited options at night in Union Square, there isn't many places to go to unless you are willing to walk through the rain and the cold during the winter time.  So we ended up at Burger Bar - wait, correction... we ended up at Burger Bar after finding out there's at least a 2 hour wait time at the Cheesecake Factory (I know, not that much better...).\n\nThe wait time at the Burger Bar will almost always be better than the alternative (50 minutes versus 2 hours).  \n\nOnce you take the elevator upstairs, you immediately arrive at the Burger Bar - which is nice.  And the hostess is already there to write your name down.  Immediately after seeing this, I thought that it was a bit inefficient.  Granted, not all restaurants have the pager system that hand out, but I felt that with the long list that they have - they should seriously consider in implementing it.  This way, their hallway will not be crowded with guests waiting for their names to be called.  Moreover, that they don't butcher people's name when they call them out. Also, since it's inside Macy's people will be able to move around and shop to their heart's content and not have to return every 5 minutes to ask if they've been called yet or what their status on their list is (which I've done 3 times and another person has done... even more frequently than myself).\n\nMoving on, once called the waitress shows you to your table and the place is crowded with not much room to move around (my mom is legally blind and it was a bit of a challenge to help move her around all the standing people, waiters, and chairs in the way).  I felt that this place needs more space or a better controlled environment.\n\nOnce seated, it took a long time before the waters were handed out (it would have been nice to have straws to accompany the water, but I suppose you have to request for them around here).  \n\nIt took even longer before our waiter (it changed from the waitress that we initially had, I wonder where she went...) came to take our order.\n\nThe prices on the menu is a bit higher than I anticipated, but considering that this is a tourist area and inside Macy's it shouldn't be too surprising.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nKobe Burger with Sweet Potato Fries (19.85)\nBurger Sliders with Skinny Fries (12.75)\nKobe Burger with Pepper Jack (17.45)\nCaramel Latte Shake (8.75)\nBlack & White Milkshake (8.75)\nLarge Pellegrino (8)\n\nIn short, I repeat that a lot of things on this list is too overpriced (note the milkshake, the latte, and the sparkling water.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the milkshake is almost worth it.  The sweet potato fries is recommended, but the kobe burger is a bit bland for my taste.  It needs more seasoning or something but it was still decent.\n\nIn short, this place needs a vast improvement in terms of service and the way the position the tables and handling crowd control.

I did not expect a Fleur-de-Lys experience at Burger Bar SF in terms of service or atmosphere.  If I wanted a fancy Hubert Keller experience I would have booked a table at Fleur de Lys but that's for another time.\n\nI went back to Burger Bar SF and had the much-discussed Rossini burger.  Yes, it comes with Kobe beef, foie gras, and shaved truffles.  Yes, it is $60.  More than anything  I loved the concept of pushing the limits of flavor profiles of burgers. \n\nThe Rossini burger came out on a big plate with a side of  au jus, sea salt, black pepper, and skinny fries.  The truffle aroma was instantly released when I poured what I assumed was a truffle au jus.  I love that earthy smell.  Foie gras  added decadent richness, and the Kobe beef was perfectly cooked to medium doneness and had more of a \"chopped\" texture than the average ground meat texture and it tasted fantastic.   \n\nWas it better than the sum of its parts?  This is what made me think about this experience for two days and a visit to another one of my favorite burger places over the weekend, to mull it over.  In the end I felt  that the three kings of flavors were competing for attention and they did not necessarily come together as well as I had hoped.  \n\nBecause it is a burger I have to put the meat first.  And I realized they had to go with Kobe beef for it to stand against the truffle and foie gras.  The truffle and au jus were great flavor enhancers for the meat, but that left the poor foie gras out in the cold.  I like the classic pairing of foie gras with something sweet and fruity to offset its richness, but in this case the contrast was lacking.  Structurally it fell a little short, too,  because while the onion bun was a good choice for this ensemble, I don't think it was toasted, and it became soggy after the  au jus.  I ate my burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nNonetheless, I was happy with the experience.  Why?  Because it made me think for TWO whole days!  \n\nIncidentally you could get the truffle as a side with their other burgers at $30.  they have some interesting alcoholic and nonalcoholic milk shake options in addition to other beverage options.  I also had a dessert chocolate burger in which chocolate mousse serves as a 'meat' in a donut pastry 'bun'.  Cute. \n\nI am still a fan.

So instead of ordering the $24 surf-and-turf, I got a $9 turkey burger (and added oyster mushrooms, cheese and avocado).\n\nStill, the food is damn good so I recommend trying it at least once.

The fries are a completely different story. Being in a restaurant purveyed by a renowned French chef I was anticipating yummy fries. What I was served were hot and salted perfectly but were dry and tough with only the flavor of the oil they were fried in. Simply put they were atrocious and disappointing.\n\nAll in all the 3 mini burgers were very tasty but not incredible and the fries were awful.

Reviewing the menu didn't take long, as they a build-your-own-burger option, and about half six or seven chef's creations.  I'm not trained in beef science, so I truly don't know the difference between black angus, kobe, or buffalo, but the choices are there for those who are beef divas.  I got a black angus burger, known as the Black Jack.  My choice was based more on the toppings accompanying, rather than the type of beef.  It was served on ciabatta (I do love ciabatta), with pesto, olive tapenade, jack cheese, and tomato.  But let me tell you, I should have ordered a pitcher of water with it.  That burger, which I had cooked medium-rare, was so dry, that a photo of it would be placed in the wikipedia entry under Mojave Desert.  So, they may not shine in the core product, however, the skinny fries, which come with each of the chef's burgers, are excellent!  They were crisp, and salted just right, yummo!

They did assure me that there will be plenty of tables to accommodate our party and true to their word, we were seated promptly upon our arrival.\n\nThe infinite number of burger combinations was too overwhelming for me so I ended up ordering the Burger Bar Sliders.  The buffalo with caramelized onions was definitely my favorite.  I've never had buffalo meat before until today and knowing how lean it is, I half-expected it to be dry but contrarily, it was was moist and juicy.  The Angus beef with bacon was pretty good too but the Country Natural beef was nothing special at all.  I subbed the skinny fries with sweet potato fries and those were pretty yummy ~ not greasy at all.\n\nMost of the people in my party seemed to enjoy their burgers as well, with the exception of one person who ordered the Chef's Veggie Burger (with lentils, peas, brown and white rice, etc...doesn't sound appetizing at all).  But then again, who would expect that to be good?  If you are a vegetarian/vegan, then you are probably better off with the Vegas Vegan (with grilled zucchini, eggplant, tomato and peppers sandwiched between two portabella mushrooms), as another coworker who ordered it said it was delish.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Milkshake Sampler Paddle, which consisted of two chocolate, two coffee and two strawberry shakes.  I had the coffee one, which was really yummy.  I tried it before mixing in the caramel on the side and the chocolate syrup in the bottom of the glass and liked it better without them as it made the shake too thick.\n\nOverall, pretty good meal.  Service was okay...nothing spectacular.  Expect to pay around $15 or so for a burger.  For those who have the money to splurge, you can try the Rossini for $60 which has Kobe beef with foie gras and shaved truffles.

The onion bun had a nice, sweet, buttery taste with good spongy texture. The accompanying dill pickle slice had a nice tart briny taste to it and was nice and crunchy. The tomato, red onion slices and lettuce were good quality and tasted nice and fresh.\n\nThe big letdown came in the form of the beef patty. It's probably better than what's in 90%+ of the burgers you encounter in the City, but it wasn't anything special. The patty itself was nice, juicy and thick, around 1/2 inch thick. Unfortunately, the patty was pretty bland. Perhaps chef Keller doesn't believe in over-seasoning the beef in the patty, but it really could have used something stupidly simple like salt to improve the taste.\n\nI suppose the \"flavor\" gets introduced in the $12+ signature burgers via the additional sauces and toppings.\n\nIn contrast, the grass fed burgers at Nopa (which currently costs $13, and includes fries) do not require ketchup or A1 steak sauce to taste good. Nor salt for that matter. Incidentally, Burger Bar provides those condiments along with good old yellow mustard. It's a bit of a shame that no attempt is made to serve up house versions of those condiments. Maybe it's cost control, but it would be nice to eat the gourmet burgers without using typical foodservice condiments from Heinz and Kraft.

Surprisingly so. In fact, I'd come back to this place just for the rings. The fat onion rings had an awesome panko breading batter that had a very nice crunch when you bit into them, the oniony innards releasing tendrils of steam.\n\nThe rings and fries were both expertly fried with good quality frying oil. Not a soggy fry or ring in sight. Kudos to the cook manning the fry station!\n\nI also tried the Caesar salad. Nicely executed. Good quality chilled romaine lettuce was tossed in a creamy dressing with a hint(?) of anchovies. The shaved parmesan added a nice kick to the salad. The wafer thin crouton slices added a nice crunchy contrast to the lettuce. I was surprised that the server didn't offer freshly ground pepper for the salad, but then again, it really didn't need it.\n\nI was eyeing a milkshakes and/or desert burger but the preceding burger, salad, and rings did me in. Perhaps next time.\n\nBoth bottled and draft beer lineup was decent, with a good selection of micro and macro brews. Wine list? Yeah, they have that too, but I couldn't be bothered. Their full bar is a nice feature for a place located in a prime location on Union Square. The Red Bull logo'd cooler in the bar kinda tells you who the targeted demographic is for the restaurant.\n\nService in general was efficient.

Oh wait...the burger I had at Burger Bar didn't consist of GOOD ground beef or TOASTED bread. Darn...\n\nAnyways, to begin with, this place doesn't take reservations. It took us THREE tries to finally get a seat, so I was super excited to actually be able to have my fat butt (THANK YOU THANKSGIVING DINNER!!!) firmly situated on one of their bar stools. The first two times we went, we were told the wait was around an hour (too long, if you ask me), so we finally got in on a Monday night, around 6PM (five minute wait). \n\nWe got a table right by the window, so had a great view of the Christmas tree, pathetic-looking fabric Menorah, and the ice-rink. The ambiance wasn't too bad, but it was quite loud, so I felt like I was yelling at the poor fellow burger-lover sitting across from me. \n\nOrdered the American Classic (black Angus beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun). When the burgers came, they looked quite impressive. It was cooked to perfection, medium, just as we had requested. The quality of the beef was OK - I've definitely had better tasting beef. The taste overall...hmm, I'm 100% sure I've had better, juicier burgers. Heck, a burger at Fuddruckers is much tastier, and it would have cost us half the price. The bun was probably toasted at some point in time, but they might have left it out in the cold, because it came to me...NOT WARM & TOASTY!!! The skinny fries are not worth mentioning...so I'm going to fast forward to my conclusion.\n\nWould I come back? Sure, but not for the burger. I'm really curious about their milkshakes. SF has too many burger joints to offer to really give me a reason to return to Burger Bar. A return trip would have to offer me a 5-star burger, not a 3-star poser. The only highlight of the evening was observing the Asian lady in front of me cautiously get onto the escalators as we ascended up to the sixth floor of Macys (where Burger Bar is located). She looked so hot from behind, with her perfectly tanned legs and smoking hot body. And once we got a look at her from the front, we perhaps lost a part of our appetite. Maybe that's why the whole burger-eating experience wasn't that good. Asian lady - you ruined it for us!!! You looked 21 from behind, and 45 from the front.

The hostess seated us at a table for four near the bar with a perfect view of Union Square.  We all ordered different burgers - the natural, the angus, the kobe. All different toppings, all different fries - and we enjoyed them all.  The sweet potato fries were just OK.  I like the skinny fries better.\n\nOverall, probably one of the best burgers I've had.  I do have my favorites, but if you're shopping in the Union Square area and want a good burger, this is the place to go.\n\nSeems like a great place to go for dessert.

They have a buffalo burger that costs 22.00 that my cousin raved about. She and her sister both ordered them.  I got the sliders (an angus, a country(?), and a buffalo) for 12.95.  The bf got the black jack which was angus with tepanade for about 13.00 also.  All of the burgers came with substitutable skinny fries. The bf & I got sweet potato fries (same price ), my cousins got the zucchini fries ($0.35extra) and the fat fries (same price i think).  They all liked their food.  The sliders looked super tiny, but they actually filled me up in the end.  I'd say their portion sizes are just right if you're hungry.\n\nOne of them also got the nutella shake which she let us try. It was really good.  Although, it was $9.00 and you don't get the extra silver cup to refill your glass when you've finished. Sad.  Again, though, if you have the money to spend and don't mind paying, then it's good.\n\nFor dessert, we decided to share two items: the dessert burger and the dessert cheeseburger?  Get the one that does not have chocolate ganache. The one with the cheesecake filling is really good, although the donut could've been less stale... hahha. It was $6.00 for each of the desserts.\n\nSomething cool was that they had a tv in each of the booths.  I see it as both a good and bad thing.. On the one hand, you get to watch exciting sports games, but if you want to have a conversation with someone, it might get too distracting.  I'm not sure if you can choose to turn the tv off... hehe.\nWould I come again? Probably not unless I magically happen to find $40 on the floor, but I would recommend it to my friends who are more financially fortunate than me.\n\nThe wait for a table was about 20-30 minutes for lunch on Friday (new years day 2010).

Was told it would be 30 minutes or I could grab a seat at the bar when they were free. The only place to wait is outside, so unless you hover (which I find annoying) the bar option is a melee. In fact, I kept checking back to the bar and the hostess pushed at least three other parties into seats at the bar ahead of me, despite the fact that I was there first. So, strike one - don't make people fight it out for the bar. Keep a list.\n\nFinally seated and waited a few minutes for waitress. When I asked her opinion she said \"we don't get to eat the food here, so I can't tell you. I'd have to come in on my free time\". Holy WTF? Hubert - really? It would take a pre-service meeting to cut up a few burgers to get your staff up to speed. Shame on you. Big big big strike two.\n\nDecor was disappointing too. Incredibly generic. Nothing about the place had any personality. It felt like an ill-placed sports bar that was completed in the 90s. Bleh.\n\nBurger took 20+ minutes to arrive. Bun was soggy on the bottom (I ordered the standard angus with \"crisp\" bacon and skinny fries). Bacon was equally soggy, so much for crispy. Fries weren't well salted. Just ok.

If Hubert is gonna put his name on something, I want an exceptional burger, well-seasoned and served with appropriate fixings.

And so sadly, and honestly, I've really had better burgers.\n\nWhere BB could have been better:\n- More preset combos: While custom designing your own burger can be cool, BB should offer more pre-set designs. Why? Because it guarantees a tasty combo. \n\nOur group opted to venture out on our own creation. American Kobe with Avocado ($16.50 + $1.55) on sesame bun. While the meat was cooked just right (medium - still pink in center) and the kobe was tender, it lacked flavor. You would have needed a couple of other toppings to make the burger taste more interesting. Otherwise, it's just ground meat.\n\nWe also tried the Salmon Steak ($8.50) on wheat. It was really boring. With no added toppings, it was doomed to dry failure. \n\n- Need softer buns: Ok, what's the point of choosing the type of buns, if they all are overly thick (out of proportion with the meat) and dry. I expected super fresh buns, toasted and soft. These were not. We ended up tossing the buns aside, and not for carb reasons.\n\n- Need Experienced Service: Maybe it was an off day, but we got a server who didn't seem to know how to take orders or remember what we ordered. Again, for an establishment with HK's name on it, we expected the best and it wasn't.\n\nWhat Made it Bearable:\n- Plenty of seating: We came just before 7p on a weeknight. Had no problems securing a table. No waiting is a plus.\n- Rockin milkshakes. We split the black and white shake and it was very tasty. Thick rich vanilla ice cream blended with oreos made this a delicious favorite.\n- Burger Bar Sliders ($12.75): You get a tasting of 3 meat - Buffalo with caramelized onions (good tasting meat complemented by the sweet onions), Angus w/ bacon (anything is better with bacon), and Natural beef w/ cheese (anything is better with cheese). It's a great way to taste the different meats and with a touch of paired topping. And the order comes with fries of your choice, while the a la carte burgers require additional ordering.\n- Cheese Cake Donut ($5.75): Thought this was a creative twist. They take a glazed donut, split in half and sandwich creamy whipped cream cheese in the center with thin slices of pineapple. The \"cheesecake\" center had a tangy note and made a nice contrast to the glazed sugar of the donut. The whipped cream mouse with almond ears and chocolate eyes was cute as it appeared he was chasing down the donut.\n\nOur total tab with additional orders of skinny fries ($3.35) and onion rings ($3.55), 1 milkshake, 1 dessert, 3 burgers, 1 soda came to $26 (with tip) per person.

We were completely unimpressed with Burger Bar this go round.\nFirst of all, I hate the decor. I hate the dark wood against the white walls, it's the epitome of Faux Pub. It's trying to be homey and loungey but only superficially. There's nothing genuine about the attempt to simulate a bar atmosphere. Just blah\nThe Kobe beef upgrade is totally not worth it. I couldn't taste the difference from the half-the-price Black Angus burger. Maybe it was a little juicier but not worth an extra 8 bucks. The flavor of the meat is kinda non-existent; a little salt and pepper would go a long way. The sourdough bun isn't sour at all; sourdough for people who don't like sourdough, and they could stand to toast it a little. The whole package was just so Blah. I really like the skinny fries though. It's really bad when I'm eating the fries more than the burger. If I ever have to go back I'll probably just order fries and a chocolate shake.\n\nI think a big factor in the \"meh-ness\" of this experience is that there are so many delicious, gourmet burgers to be had for much, much cheaper.

Definitely better than our first - bubbly, attentive, and willing. Things were smooth until the place got busier. After a while we never saw our waitress so it took forever to get anything. When we tried to flag her down she gave us the index finger. So we tried to ask someone to pass on the message that we wanted some tea... when that didn't come after 15 minutes we were able to finally get her attention and she said she never got the message and that she'd make sure the tea would make its way to our table - never happened.

There are booths with personal TVs and the restaurant has the feel of a classy diner.\n\nWe came here early to beat the lunch rush. We were immediately seated next to a window that had breathtaking views of Union Square (kudos to that!). The menu is not overly complicated, but PLEASE NOTE that when you order a \"create your own burger,\" fries do not come with your order, which warranted a major demerit in my opinion. However, the specials come with skinny fries. My friend ordered to Kobe beef burger and I ordered the Hawaiian Burger.

A little pricey but it is the leanest of the burgers offered. The downside is that it does not include fries so you have to fork up another USD 3-4 to get those.\n\nShakes are a big deal here but we could not really fit it in. There was just one guy doing those drinks so I guess they take them seriously. So it you are into them you might be in for a real treat.\n\nSERVICE: They told us the wait would be 45 mins but it ended up being only 30mins.

This was GREAT.\n\nThe big PLUS is seeing Hubert Keller just working away, giving away shakes and being cute with the kids. We did not meet him but he seemed really nice and just very normal.\n\nAMBIANCE: It is noisy and I wish they put some time in improving the lighting. Right now it's like being in a Safeway.\n\nTHE MINUS: The Burger Bar should get rid off the TVs in the booths in the back. In fact, the narrow corridor with booths close to kitchen and coffee station is a downer. We felt like we were being punished when we were sat there. Your view is either the kitchen doors or the coffee station.\n\nHUBERT TO DO LIST: Get rid of the 2 top booths--they are uncomfortable. You are too much of a nice guy to have a Siberia section in your restaurant! Also, the TV have to go. You can't control them and you can't hear them so what's the point. It's awkward on a 2 top.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIt was obviously the 2nd day after opening so you could tell with some of the staff but overall there was a real effort to ensure we had a good time and that is really commendable.

We were initially given $31 menus which consist of an appetizer course, meal course of your choice, and a dessert of your choice. The host requested $27 menus which only consist of the first two listed in the $31 menu minus the salmon sandwich.\n\nThe dessert looked good though...so I got it. The desserts were milkshakes so I got the Caramel Latte flavor. Really pretty presentation and delicious in every way (very generous with caramel) but DAMN. REALLY overpriced. $10! I didn't know how much it cost until I got my check!\n\nThe appetizer course consisted of beer battered jalape\u00f1o pickles, onion rings, and zucchini fries. Another table had yam fries in place of zucchini fries. All of the appetizers were delicious. The table favorite was the onion rings because they're irresistibly crispy. This appetizer course came with a trio of sauces: chipotle aioli, BBQ sauce, and house ranch. All three were good but the favorite was chipotle aioli.\n\nThe meal course consisted of a few choices in burgers and sandwiches but I chose the American Burger which was a classic cheeseburger with bacon. I chose to get Medium rare but medium rare here is WAY more rare than you would think....so I requested having the medium well which was perfectly pink and juicy.\n\nThe quality of the burger was good. It was very juicy and delicious but not totally memorable. The fries were pretty good. I appreciate good fries.\n\nService was also really nice and attentive. The only issue we had with the service was the communication between the cooks and the servers who gave us our food. Several of us ordered the same burger but with different variations of done-ness. I had to cut into everyone's burgers just to figure out which ones were which and in the end a lot of us had to have them recooked because they were less well-done than we were expecting...if that makes sense. \n\nTotal (for me) came out to be around $50.

BB has its own elevator that takes you directly to the restaurant, which is located on the 6th floor and boasts a beautiful view of downtown. BB is more like a Ruth Chris than a normal burger place like Red Robin or Islands. The staff wears fancy, all black outfits. The bar area and the dining room are both dimly lit and really fancy decorated. The one thing about BB that I really loved is that every booth has its own personal, small flat screen television that is hooked up with Direct TV. They actually let you watch what you want, which was cool for my group because we were able to watch some college football while we enjoyed our burgers. \n\nThe menu at BB is pretty impressive. Besides the build you own burger option they also offer many signature burgers, one of which that costs $60 and contains a Kobe beef patty, saut\u00e9ed foie gras, shaved truffles and maderia sauce (not sure what that sauce is but it sounds fancy). They also offer salads, chicken burgers, buffalo burgers and salmon burgers. After looking over the many options on the menu, this is what I created: \n\nCiabatta Bread- Kobe Beef Patty- Blue Cheese- Pepper Jack Cheese- Avocado- Caramelized Onions- Jalape\u00f1o Bacon- Prosciutto- Button Mushrooms- Lettuce- Tomatoes- Pickles- Pesto Sauce- Garlic Aioli \n\nMy burger was fantastic. This was defiantly one of the better burgers I have had from a build your own burger restaurant. The Kobe patty was big, juicy and flavorful. All the toppings were great, especially the jalapeno bacon, which was super crispy and had a nice spicy flavor. To go along with our burgers my friends and I shared an order of sweet potato fries and onion rings, both of which were wonderful. BB also has an incredible dessert menu. They have a build your our milkshake option that offers some of the coolest mix ins I have ever seen. You can mix in things like Nutella, Twinkies, Peanut Butter, and all different types of candies, etc. They also have dessert burgers that use donuts for buns and contain different fruits and other sweet condiments. \n\nSince BB is an upscale place I was expecting the service to be great, and it was. Our waitress was super friendly, even after we kept asking her to change our TV from one football game to another. The entire time we were there, she was very attentive and chit chatted with us whenever she stopped by our table and checked on us. \n\nThe reason I think BB has such a bad rep on Yelp is because of the high prices. Again, this place is an upscale restaurant so I knew ahead of time that I was going to have to drop at least forty dollars for a burger. The burger patty itself and all the toppings were of higher quality so I did not mind the high prices. To be honest it was not the best burger I have ever had but it was still amazing.

OVER HYPED & NOT WORTH THE WAIT!\n\nDespite Mr. Keller being at the restaurant there that night, service was horrible. We should have known the moment we found out that they gave our table away. We were a party of 10 and had been waiting for 1.5 hours. Cheesecake Factory was the original plan but the estimated time was 3 hours there.\n\nFlag #1: We were seated and they brought waters for 7/9 people. We ordered our food and asked for water, but it never came.\n\n#2: Food came out and we were missing 2 burgers and a side of fries. We thought they were going to bring it out. No one noticed for about 5-10 mins and we had to flag down multiple people to inquire about it. They kept saying, \"It's coming out.\" Then one guy goes, \"It's coming right out.....By the way, what did you order???\" You mean bullshit is coming right out?\n\n#3: They brought out one burger that was missing and we were wondering why he was scraping off the mushrooms. He said I didn't order that (btw, he's 10 years old). He ordered the plain basic burger, but they brought out a kobe burger with mushrooms. Since he was hungry, he ate it anyways.\n\n#4: About 25 mins after the manager got involved with our missing burgers, the chicken burger finally came out and the rest of the party was already done eating by then. They did not even comp this burger even though we had to ask 10 times about it before they took action. Also, the server said the chef would bring it out himself. We were kind of excited and got our cameras out, but that never happened even though we saw him walking around the restaurant. We noticed everyone started avoiding our table after that burger fiasco, especially the managers. They would avoid eye contact or turn around before they reached our section.\n\n#5: When the bill came, they charged us for the kobe burger even though we had ordered the plain burger, but was given the kobe. It was a $7 difference so we asked the server about it. He implied that since he ate the kobe burger that we should pay for it. Seriously? We have to pay for your mistake?? Then after realizing that NO we weren't doing that, he reluctantly got it taken care of. Needless to say, we didn't leave a good tip.\n\n#6: Bad Customer Service. My friends and I have been in the hospitality industry for years, so we understand issues/problems that come up, but the way they handled everything was appalling. They weren't sorry for making the mistake and even tried to make it sound like it was our fault. They could have simply comped the 2 burgers that came extremely late. ANY other restaurant would have done something for their mistake like comping the meal or providing a free dessert. How everyone handled the situation, including the managers, server, busboy, runners, was to \"cover their ass.\"\n\nFOOD:\n- Grilled Shrimp Salad: over drenched with dressing, shrimps & grilled vegges were okay\n- Kobe Beef Burger: nothing special, served with basic tomato, onion, lettuce side, bread good texture\n- Onion Rings: taste like any other place\n- Sweet Potato Fries: good, but a little surprised this gourmet restaurant didn't serve any type of aioli sauce to accompany the fries\n\nFrankly, I think the server messed up and simply forgot to put in the order for the last 2 burgers. He was busy with 2 large parties and had a few other tables. That's a lot of people to handle for one server. Either have a seasoned server or don't be short staffed like that on a busy Saturday night.\n\nEveryone knew about our table and how we were upset. We complained to the manager (Edward) again after paying for our meal. He was nice enough to listen but they didn't do much to make us want to come back. He simply said we could write to the GM on this card. It was a basic restaurant card with no email address and no name.\n\nYeah, Burger Bar is located in a prime location where the amount of tourists alone that visit will pay for the rent, but good luck surviving when it's off season. Also, it's logistically a nightmare to get in & out of the place, especially when Macy's closes. They only have ONE ELEVATOR. Be prepared to wait and panic if there's a fire or earthquake. The only good thing is they have a very extensive beer list and you can watch the game. The bartenders are efficient. \n\nI would rather wait 3 hours at Cheesecake Factory.

"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Being an avid Top Chef Fan, I was so excited to go to Burger Bar after hearing they serve Kobe beef and foie gras. After seeing mixed reviews on YELP, I wanted to wait a bit hoping they would iron out their wrinkles. After several weeks later, I just couldn't wait...was it worth the wait? ABOSULTELY NOT! I have to say I AGREE with all the negative reviews regarding Burger Bar's food quality, pricing, and service. \n\nMy friend and I came here on a Monday night around 6:10 p.m. We waited for about 5 minutes before we were seated. Upon walking to our booth, I was shockingly surprised about how mundane the d\u00e9cor was. More on d\u00e9cor later.\n\nFOOD:\n*Kobe Burger w/ Foie Gras and Swiss Cheese on an Onion Bun: The Kobe was very meh. I have had Kobe several times before and I have to say I agree with all the other YELPERS who say it tasted exactly like ground beef. The Kobe wasn't seasoned properly and therefore lacked flavor. I requested the Kobe be cooked MEDIUM, but it was WELL-DONE. \n\nOk, while the Foie Gras and Kobe sounds like a good combo in theory; it didn't pair well together. Because the patty was substantially larger as compared to the foie gras; it got lost in the patty. The only thing it did to the burger was add a salty oily flavor to it. \n\n*Skinny Fries w/ Chili Aioli Sauce: The fries were ok; I would say something to comparable to McD's fries minus the salt. They would have probably tasted better if they were hot versus lukewarm. There was NO kick or heat in the chili aioli sauce. It looked and tasted like colored mayo.\n\n*Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Nutella and homemade whip cream: They claim their ice cream to be homemade? I'm guessing that's why it took 33 minutes to get our ice cream! The ice cream was just average; there was nothing that really stood out about it. \n\nPRICING: Build your burger concept...pick your patty which ranges in prices. Then if you want to add cheese, grilled onions, veggies, condiments (i.e. Dijon mustard), etc, there's a separate charge. \n\nMy Kobe w/ Foie Gras and Swiss Cheese came out to be about $30. Fries were an additional $3.35. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was nice; however, once we first seated, she was anxious to get our orders. And, after we received our food, she was no where to be found. It took about 25-30 minutes to get our burgers. After eating out burgers, we decided to order dessert. After 20 minutes of waiting for our ice cream, we flagged down the waitress to cancel our order. She said they were running behind schedule, and that they were preparing it right now. Another 10 minutes passes, and nothing. We asked again to cancel the order and to just get the bill. She apologized and said the Manager will comp the ice cream and they were making it now. After waiting a total of 33 minutes, we finally got it. Unless you're churning the ice cream as we speak, it should NOT take that long to scoop ice cream and pour some nutella sauce on it. \n\nD\u00c9COR/AMBIANCE: Ummm, if you're going to serve burgers ranging from $15-$60, you better have a decor that's more extravagant than the typical Sports Bar and Grill which pretty much sums it up. Cheesecake's d\u00e9cor puts Burger Bar's d\u00e9cor to shame. Sad...And, what is up with the TVs in the booths? It was very distracting especially when trying to hold a conversation. So yah, fellas, not a good date place. \n\nCROWD: Tourists, tourists, and more tourists. I guess they should be thankful that they're located in a prime location. \n\nWe were able to see Chef Hubert Keller walking around the restaurant, hence the 2 stars. Would have been a nice touch if he made an effort to reach out to the patrons...\n\nTo sum it all up, I was disappointed with my experience at Burger Bar and highly doubt I would return, nor would I recommend it to anyone. There's far better places to get a burger that's more reasonable (e.g. Bullshead, Barney's, etc).

"], "author": "Abby M.", "review": "As a culinarian I enjoy seeing playfulness and creativity in classic creations that can oftentimes become trite and predictable. However, as a Georgia girl raised on a cattle farm, I can really appreciate a well-crafted burger and I do not find comfort in (for example) the ground shrimp concoctions that are taking the place of an all-beef patty on certain trendy menus. This being said, I was excited to visit Chef Hubert Keller's Burger Bar while I was staying in San Francisco this past month; it certainly did not hurt that my hotel was in eye-sight of the Macy's in which Burger Bar is located. My classmate, who works as a Chef in her own state, is just as much of a burger freak as I am and was thrilled at the idea of stopping in on our way back to the hotel from our romp around the Ferry Building. Upon checking-in with the hostess we were told to expect a 15 minute wait and were satisfied that we only had to stall for about 7 or 8 minutes. Even better, we were seated next to a window overlooking Union Square so that we could enjoy the beautiful day outside from our comfortable perch 6 stories up.\n\nWalking the hills again had re-whetted my appetite and thirst so I started my order with a Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen while Robin went for a flight of sampler pours including the Pyramid Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Pyramid Outburst Imperial IPA and the privately-labeled Burger Bar Brew. Robin seemed to enjoy getting to taste so many options and I thoroughly enjoyed my wheat beer; it was the perfect weather for this light, slightly yeasty wheat beer. Before we could make up our minds on burgers (there are SO many options to either pick a composed burger or to create your own from endless choices) we picked out an appetizer to split. The Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles were something to behold and provided the perfect combination of slightly pickled, flavorful heat and substantial batter to absorb the spicy juices and create a rich, yet slightly crisp, exterior. The chipotle aioli that accompanied the jalapeno fries provided just enough creaminess to balance the heat; I cannot see ordering these gems with any other sauce offered on the menu. Finally, as if the fun flavors were not enough, the battered peppers were served in a cute miniature fry-basket; this was a first in presentation for me!\n\nMulling over the menu while I munched on jalapenos helped to inspire my customized burger and Robin and I agreed that we were ready to place our next order just as our waitress approached. I was allowed to order first and chose a toasted onion bun as my base, the sustainable Country Natural burger (cooked mid-rare), caramelized onion and pan-seared foie gras for my add-ons and the rich red wine and shallot reduction as my sauce. After placing my order I guess Robin decided to simplify things and just asked for one of the same, right down to the skinny fries with a classic aioli. Despite my longing for the $60 Rossini Burger (a Kobe creation oozing black truffles and foie gras) I was thrilled with my own composition and I am comfortable to say that this ranked in my top five favorite burgers and is kept company by the Black Tie Burger of Minetta Tavern in Manhattan and the 10 O'clock Burger of Holeman & Finch in Atlanta (In-N-Out holds a spot near the top as well, but for totally different reasons). The burger was perfectly cooked and rich without being fatty and the foie gras added a beautiful element of creamy caramelization and decadence (gotta get your fix of California foie gras before July 1st!). The shallot reduction was the perfect finish to the structure and the fries were an excellent accompaniment without being too starchy, yet still satisfying.\n\nI will go back to Burger Bar again next time that I am on the west coast and would definitely check out Chef Keller's Las Vegas Burger Bar location next time I am in Sin City.

With a beautiful view of Union Square, you can sit right up against the floor to ceiling windows, without the threat gale-force winds.\n\nAt my 5 star visit, a friend and I went right before the dinner rush on a weekday. We started with a french fry duo. The sweet potato and the skinny fries were good, but what made them great was the chipotle aioli. Yes, it was an extra 40cents for the side, but our attentive waiter let us know it was worth it. What wasn't worth it? Paying extra for not only sauce but fries. \n\nEntree time: my friend had a standard beef burger, and I opted for Salmon. Our server was very helpful and even gave me the choice of ordering my salmon burger \"med\". So, with a side salad, I tried the \"med\" cooked salmon and found it actually pretty amazing. If you're not a fan of cooked fish (aka, a big fan of sushi or tare tartare) this would be the seafood burger for you. It was seasoned well, and most importantly, not dry.\n\nTo end an overall great meal we went for the gusto and had the beer float sampler. Say it again: B E E R  F L O A T. Ice cream and beer. With 5 beerfloats to sample, we were elated. I'm not a big beer drinker, but of course curiosity got the best of me.  My favorite of all of them was the Raspberry Velvet. It was sweeter and the ice cream and berry beer seem to mesh better rather than the strawberry ice cream and pale ale float (that one had a sweet/savory thing going on. Still good though!) There was one float you should stay away from. I'm not sure about the name, but it was the only minty one. So when you get to one that tastes like mint, set that one aside, or cover it with a napkin. Do what you can to forget about it. \n\nThe 1-star visit? Let's just say\nHorrible service, even though it was dead in there: Monday night, hour before closing. I and a few friends did a round of beer floats that were late and practically thrown at us. \n\nVeggie burger was very tasty, but again, slow service with not a smile. but with more of an irritated grimace. \n\nDessert? Why not a burger again!? The Dessert burger had a krispy kreme-esque donut bun, nutella & chopped hazelnut \"patty\", strawberries, kiwi, and a mango jelly \"cheese slice\". All together, the components of this dessert were good. If you're a fan of dessert mash-ups, like ice cream sandwiches you'll like this. Some of my friends disagreed, and would have opted for just the nutella patty, making it a protein style dessert burger.   \n\nOverall:\nPros - Go at an earlier hour, where the servers are at a better disposition. Sit by the window, if there are no window seats, leave, or get really drunk off beer floats. Try the non-beef items, ironically, but no matter, what, try the beer floats.\n\nCons - Bring 40 extra cents if you want to make your fries stand out, and avoid the surly servers.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The fried zucchini were good and even better dipped in the aioli.

But the promise of good meat and milkshakes spurred me on in spite of it all.\n\nWhen we arrived we heeded a fellow yelper's advice to avoid the elevator...it takes forever and people really jam themselves in there!  So we scurried up the escalators without any problems.  We checked in and were told that the wait was 45 to 60 min.  So we wandered about the china and glassware department to make fun of the crap they sell at Macys...really, who buys a casarole dish with a lid shaped like a bunny?!?!  After a while we just loitered near the door and listened for our party of 6 to be called.  To our surprise, we were seated in about 30 minutes.  WOW!  Didn't see that coming.\n\nWe got a nice table right in front of the milkshake bar.  Our orders were taken promptly and our drinks came out before we knew it.  My caramel latte shake was fantastic.  Very smooth and creamy...not  a super thick consistency that requires vacuum suction to get up the straw.  My only complaint is that for an $8 shake, the portion could have been more generous.\n\nOur food came to us fairly quickly.  The food itself was good.  Not out of this world, but not bad either.  I mean, they're burgers!  I had the sliders and they were tasty, nicely presented and filling.  They came with skinny fries that were good, but I have had better.  My friends had a variety of burgers:  buffalo, angus, kobe.  Again, all very good.  One person thought her burger was a little over cooked, but the truffle sauce more than made up for it.  The sides were pretty good, too.  The sweet potato fries were great and so were the onion rings.  The fried zucchini were good and even better dipped in the aioli.  My friends reported that the fried pickles were a bit disappointing...I didn't try them myself because, well, they were fried pickles.  eeww.  \n\nI will definitely want to come back to try some other things on the menu.  The Peppercorn cream sauce was calling to me.  As was the Surf & Turf Burger (a burger with half a lobster on it...HALF A LOBSTER!!!)\n\nAs for price, yes, it's very spendy.  But when you go to a place like that, what do you expect?!  It's in Macy's for godssakes!  You're paying for the Hubert Keller name, the view and all the fluff.  But I think people have overlooked the fact that you are also paying for some quality ingredients that go into these burgers (even though they are just burgers).  Foie Gras and truffles ain't cheap (but they are oh, so good!).\n\nOur server was a very nice young woman who checked on us often and was not judging as we greedily slurped up our truffle sauce.  A small troop of servers helped her bring our food to us so it all hit the table at the same time:  one of my standards of excellent service.\n\nWill I go back to Burger Bar?  Yes (remember, half a lobster!).  Will I go there often, No.  It's a good place to go, but it's definitely a special occasion kind of thing.

We showed up around 1 on a Sunday, and there was the Nike Women's marathon and everything going on so the wait was understandable. Plus this was the 3rd day it was open so everyone would be eager to try it. \n\nSo after we were seated, the waitress came and took our order. I had the Kobe Beef burger, with caramelized onions and portabello mushrooms on an onion bun. When it finally came, it was beautiful. I can't put into words how excited I was. I took a bite, and it just was heavenly. The burger was nicely rested, so the juices were in the burger instead of the bun or the plate. It had a great flavor, like almost having a King cut from House of Prime Rib, in burger form. Very fresh beef. And being that it was Kobe beef, it melted as soon as it reached the palette. The combination of that, with the Earthiness of the mushroom and the sweetness of the onions was just edible nirvana. There were condiments such as tabasco, ketchup, A1 steak sauce, and mustard available at the table, but believe me, those aren't needed. Those will just mask the true flavors of the burger. \n\nShe had an angus burger, with baby spinach, and portobello as well. I kind of preferred the angus over the kobe. The angus was more of a burger-burger. It was meaty and it had incredible meaty texture and flavor. I honestly have never had a burger that good. (Sorry Darla's but you've been dethroned). What kicked the most was the aioli. It comes separate, and costs an additional $.45, but it's worth it. It gives the burger such a great kick. Plus it's great to dip the sweet potato fries in. \n\nWhich brings me to the fries. I can kinda do without them. At $3.35 or so a plate, it was a pretty pathetic portion. Granted, one shouldn't eat too many sweet potatoes in general unless they're asking to become a foul smelling musical instrument for the next few hours, but hey seriously, why skimp out on the fries? It was almost a half portion it seemed to me, coming on a white plate with lots of gaps and holes, the presentation was just awful. \n\nAside from that, the experience was great. Service was a bit slow, but I'm forgiving since they just opened. Hubert Keller was walking around, greeting people and giving out mini milkshakes...which I noticed that he gave them mainly to parties of all women. I didn't get one =[.

I did not expect a Fleur-de-Lys experience at Burger Bar SF in terms of service or atmosphere.  If I wanted a fancy Hubert Keller experience I would have booked a table at Fleur de Lys but that's for another time.\n\nI went back to Burger Bar SF and had the much-discussed Rossini burger.  Yes, it comes with Kobe beef, foie gras, and shaved truffles.  Yes, it is $60.  More than anything  I loved the concept of pushing the limits of flavor profiles of burgers. \n\nThe Rossini burger came out on a big plate with a side of  au jus, sea salt, black pepper, and skinny fries.  The truffle aroma was instantly released when I poured what I assumed was a truffle au jus.  I love that earthy smell.  Foie gras  added decadent richness, and the Kobe beef was perfectly cooked to medium doneness and had more of a \"chopped\" texture than the average ground meat texture and it tasted fantastic.   \n\nWas it better than the sum of its parts?  This is what made me think about this experience for two days and a visit to another one of my favorite burger places over the weekend, to mull it over.  In the end I felt  that the three kings of flavors were competing for attention and they did not necessarily come together as well as I had hoped.  \n\nBecause it is a burger I have to put the meat first.  And I realized they had to go with Kobe beef for it to stand against the truffle and foie gras.  The truffle and au jus were great flavor enhancers for the meat, but that left the poor foie gras out in the cold.  I like the classic pairing of foie gras with something sweet and fruity to offset its richness, but in this case the contrast was lacking.  Structurally it fell a little short, too,  because while the onion bun was a good choice for this ensemble, I don't think it was toasted, and it became soggy after the  au jus.  I ate my burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nNonetheless, I was happy with the experience.  Why?  Because it made me think for TWO whole days!  \n\nIncidentally you could get the truffle as a side with their other burgers at $30.  they have some interesting alcoholic and nonalcoholic milk shake options in addition to other beverage options.  I also had a dessert chocolate burger in which chocolate mousse serves as a 'meat' in a donut pastry 'bun'.  Cute. \n\nI am still a fan.

Surprisingly so. In fact, I'd come back to this place just for the rings. The fat onion rings had an awesome panko breading batter that had a very nice crunch when you bit into them, the oniony innards releasing tendrils of steam.\n\nThe rings and fries were both expertly fried with good quality frying oil. Not a soggy fry or ring in sight. Kudos to the cook manning the fry station!\n\nI also tried the Caesar salad. Nicely executed. Good quality chilled romaine lettuce was tossed in a creamy dressing with a hint(?) of anchovies. The shaved parmesan added a nice kick to the salad. The wafer thin crouton slices added a nice crunchy contrast to the lettuce. I was surprised that the server didn't offer freshly ground pepper for the salad, but then again, it really didn't need it.\n\nI was eyeing a milkshakes and/or desert burger but the preceding burger, salad, and rings did me in. Perhaps next time.\n\nBoth bottled and draft beer lineup was decent, with a good selection of micro and macro brews. Wine list? Yeah, they have that too, but I couldn't be bothered. Their full bar is a nice feature for a place located in a prime location on Union Square. The Red Bull logo'd cooler in the bar kinda tells you who the targeted demographic is for the restaurant.\n\nService in general was efficient. The front of house hostesses were okay, going through the motions. They did their best to manage the quiet chaos in the front lobby. They could have been work release workers from Cheesecake Gulag Factory for all I knew.\n\nBurger Bar provides a decent dining alternative in Union Square to the madhouse cum tourist trap and formulaic corporate restaurant known as Cheesecake Factory. Oh hang on, Burger Bar is a formulaic corporate... At any rate, after a long day of shopping, you're probably going to get a table at Burger Bar in the time you manage to get one of those buzzer gizmos at Cheesecake Factory that starts your long-ass wait.\n\nOh, and I managed to get a dinner and a show on the night I went. Chef Keller was chatting up with guests and mugging for photos with starstruck diners. Bah. Gimme a break. I wished chef was in the kitchen checking on my burger before it was served to me.

So, we wandered Macy's for about 40 minutes and returned up to the hostess stand.

I interrupted her conversation with the other hostesses and asked why we were still waiting and she said she didn't realize they had to clean the table.  So, it takes 15 minutes to clean off a table.\n\nWe were brought to what may be the worst table in the place.  It was jammed up against a wall that jutted into the dining room and squished between other tables, but just a stone's throw from a window  seat overlooking Union Sq.

Ten minutes later, they seated a couple at my requested table.\n\nAlthough we immediately placed our drink and burger orders, it took a good 20 minutes to get our drinks and then almost 45 minutes to get our burgers.  When I stopped the waitress after half an hour and inquired about the state of my burger, she flippantly said, \"We're really busy.\"  She then yelled out something about checking the burger's status as she walked away.  She never checked and, finally, the food came to us.\n\nMy burger was fine, the meat was good and it was prepared medium rare as I had requested.  I got the Country Natural, which is the sustainably farmed burger, and cost $.75 more than the Angus burger.  I was a bit disappointed in Hubert here, if you can provide the sustainably farmed burger, why even bother serving something else?  The burger was thick and the ingredients were good, but it was definitely nothing special--and in no way worth $15.

The host requested $27 menus which only consist of the first two listed in the $31 menu minus the salmon sandwich.\n\nThe dessert looked good though...so I got it.

It was very juicy and delicious but not totally memorable. The fries were pretty good. I appreciate good fries.\n\nService was also really nice and attentive. The only issue we had with the service was the communication between the cooks and the servers who gave us our food. Several of us ordered the same burger but with different variations of done-ness. I had to cut into everyone's burgers just to figure out which ones were which and in the end a lot of us had to have them recooked because they were less well-done than we were expecting...if that makes sense. \n\nTotal (for me) came out to be around $50.

"], "author": "Abby M.", "review": "As a culinarian I enjoy seeing playfulness and creativity in classic creations that can oftentimes become trite and predictable. However, as a Georgia girl raised on a cattle farm, I can really appreciate a well-crafted burger and I do not find comfort in (for example) the ground shrimp concoctions that are taking the place of an all-beef patty on certain trendy menus. This being said, I was excited to visit Chef Hubert Keller's Burger Bar while I was staying in San Francisco this past month; it certainly did not hurt that my hotel was in eye-sight of the Macy's in which Burger Bar is located. My classmate, who works as a Chef in her own state, is just as much of a burger freak as I am and was thrilled at the idea of stopping in on our way back to the hotel from our romp around the Ferry Building. Upon checking-in with the hostess we were told to expect a 15 minute wait and were satisfied that we only had to stall for about 7 or 8 minutes. Even better, we were seated next to a window overlooking Union Square so that we could enjoy the beautiful day outside from our comfortable perch 6 stories up.\n\nWalking the hills again had re-whetted my appetite and thirst so I started my order with a Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen while Robin went for a flight of sampler pours including the Pyramid Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Pyramid Outburst Imperial IPA and the privately-labeled Burger Bar Brew. Robin seemed to enjoy getting to taste so many options and I thoroughly enjoyed my wheat beer; it was the perfect weather for this light, slightly yeasty wheat beer. Before we could make up our minds on burgers (there are SO many options to either pick a composed burger or to create your own from endless choices) we picked out an appetizer to split. The Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles were something to behold and provided the perfect combination of slightly pickled, flavorful heat and substantial batter to absorb the spicy juices and create a rich, yet slightly crisp, exterior. The chipotle aioli that accompanied the jalapeno fries provided just enough creaminess to balance the heat; I cannot see ordering these gems with any other sauce offered on the menu. Finally, as if the fun flavors were not enough, the battered peppers were served in a cute miniature fry-basket; this was a first in presentation for me!\n\nMulling over the menu while I munched on jalapenos helped to inspire my customized burger and Robin and I agreed that we were ready to place our next order just as our waitress approached. I was allowed to order first and chose a toasted onion bun as my base, the sustainable Country Natural burger (cooked mid-rare), caramelized onion and pan-seared foie gras for my add-ons and the rich red wine and shallot reduction as my sauce. After placing my order I guess Robin decided to simplify things and just asked for one of the same, right down to the skinny fries with a classic aioli. Despite my longing for the $60 Rossini Burger (a Kobe creation oozing black truffles and foie gras) I was thrilled with my own composition and I am comfortable to say that this ranked in my top five favorite burgers and is kept company by the Black Tie Burger of Minetta Tavern in Manhattan and the 10 O'clock Burger of Holeman & Finch in Atlanta (In-N-Out holds a spot near the top as well, but for totally different reasons). The burger was perfectly cooked and rich without being fatty and the foie gras added a beautiful element of creamy caramelization and decadence (gotta get your fix of California foie gras before July 1st!). The shallot reduction was the perfect finish to the structure and the fries were an excellent accompaniment without being too starchy, yet still satisfying.\n\nI will go back to Burger Bar again next time that I am on the west coast and would definitely check out Chef Keller's Las Vegas Burger Bar location next time I am in Sin City.

Yes, it was an extra 40cents for the side, but our attentive waiter let us know it was worth it. What wasn't worth it? Paying extra for not only sauce but fries. \n\nEntree time: my friend had a standard beef burger, and I opted for Salmon. Our server was very helpful and even gave me the choice of ordering my salmon burger \"med\". So, with a side salad, I tried the \"med\" cooked salmon and found it actually pretty amazing. If you're not a fan of cooked fish (aka, a big fan of sushi or tare tartare) this would be the seafood burger for you. It was seasoned well, and most importantly, not dry.\n\nTo end an overall great meal we went for the gusto and had the beer float sampler. Say it again: B E E R  F L O A T. Ice cream and beer. With 5 beerfloats to sample, we were elated. I'm not a big beer drinker, but of course curiosity got the best of me.  My favorite of all of them was the Raspberry Velvet. It was sweeter and the ice cream and berry beer seem to mesh better rather than the strawberry ice cream and pale ale float (that one had a sweet/savory thing going on. Still good though!) There was one float you should stay away from. I'm not sure about the name, but it was the only minty one. So when you get to one that tastes like mint, set that one aside, or cover it with a napkin. Do what you can to forget about it. \n\nThe 1-star visit? Let's just say\nHorrible service, even though it was dead in there: Monday night, hour before closing. I and a few friends did a round of beer floats that were late and practically thrown at us. \n\nVeggie burger was very tasty, but again, slow service with not a smile. but with more of an irritated grimace. \n\nDessert? Why not a burger again!? The Dessert burger had a krispy kreme-esque donut bun, nutella & chopped hazelnut \"patty\", strawberries, kiwi, and a mango jelly \"cheese slice\".

So, we wandered Macy's for about 40 minutes and returned up to the hostess stand.  She brightly said, \"We can take you now!\"  I was very pleased, and then, for some unknown reason, stood for another 15 minutes at the hostess stand.  I interrupted her conversation with the other hostesses and asked why we were still waiting and she said she didn't realize they had to clean the table.  So, it takes 15 minutes to clean off a table.\n\nWe were brought to what may be the worst table in the place.  It was jammed up against a wall that jutted into the dining room and squished between other tables, but just a stone's throw from a window  seat overlooking Union Sq.  I asked the waitress if we could be seated in the window and she said it was a table for four people, and they had to hold it for that sized party.  I understood and sat at our crappy table.  Ten minutes later, they seated a couple at my requested table.\n\nAlthough we immediately placed our drink and burger orders, it took a good 20 minutes to get our drinks and then almost 45 minutes to get our burgers.  When I stopped the waitress after half an hour and inquired about the state of my burger, she flippantly said, \"We're really busy.\"  She then yelled out something about checking the burger's status as she walked away.  She never checked and, finally, the food came to us.\n\nMy burger was fine, the meat was good and it was prepared medium rare as I had requested.  I got the Country Natural, which is the sustainably farmed burger, and cost $.75 more than the Angus burger.  I was a bit disappointed in Hubert here, if you can provide the sustainably farmed burger, why even bother serving something else?  The burger was thick and the ingredients were good, but it was definitely nothing special--and in no way worth $15.  The sweet potato fries were fine (a bit thin), but without the chipotle aioli, they wouldn't have been as good.  We also both ordered the truffle sauce, about which I was super excited.  What a joke!  It tasted NOTHING like truffles and didn't even have a truffle aroma.  It was clearly just a mushroom gravy.

"], "author": "Abby M.", "review": "As a culinarian I enjoy seeing playfulness and creativity in classic creations that can oftentimes become trite and predictable. However, as a Georgia girl raised on a cattle farm, I can really appreciate a well-crafted burger and I do not find comfort in (for example) the ground shrimp concoctions that are taking the place of an all-beef patty on certain trendy menus. This being said, I was excited to visit Chef Hubert Keller's Burger Bar while I was staying in San Francisco this past month; it certainly did not hurt that my hotel was in eye-sight of the Macy's in which Burger Bar is located. My classmate, who works as a Chef in her own state, is just as much of a burger freak as I am and was thrilled at the idea of stopping in on our way back to the hotel from our romp around the Ferry Building. Upon checking-in with the hostess we were told to expect a 15 minute wait and were satisfied that we only had to stall for about 7 or 8 minutes. Even better, we were seated next to a window overlooking Union Square so that we could enjoy the beautiful day outside from our comfortable perch 6 stories up.\n\nWalking the hills again had re-whetted my appetite and thirst so I started my order with a Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen while Robin went for a flight of sampler pours including the Pyramid Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Pyramid Outburst Imperial IPA and the privately-labeled Burger Bar Brew. Robin seemed to enjoy getting to taste so many options and I thoroughly enjoyed my wheat beer; it was the perfect weather for this light, slightly yeasty wheat beer. Before we could make up our minds on burgers (there are SO many options to either pick a composed burger or to create your own from endless choices) we picked out an appetizer to split. The Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles were something to behold and provided the perfect combination of slightly pickled, flavorful heat and substantial batter to absorb the spicy juices and create a rich, yet slightly crisp, exterior. The chipotle aioli that accompanied the jalapeno fries provided just enough creaminess to balance the heat; I cannot see ordering these gems with any other sauce offered on the menu. Finally, as if the fun flavors were not enough, the battered peppers were served in a cute miniature fry-basket; this was a first in presentation for me!\n\nMulling over the menu while I munched on jalapenos helped to inspire my customized burger and Robin and I agreed that we were ready to place our next order just as our waitress approached. I was allowed to order first and chose a toasted onion bun as my base, the sustainable Country Natural burger (cooked mid-rare), caramelized onion and pan-seared foie gras for my add-ons and the rich red wine and shallot reduction as my sauce. After placing my order I guess Robin decided to simplify things and just asked for one of the same, right down to the skinny fries with a classic aioli. Despite my longing for the $60 Rossini Burger (a Kobe creation oozing black truffles and foie gras) I was thrilled with my own composition and I am comfortable to say that this ranked in my top five favorite burgers and is kept company by the Black Tie Burger of Minetta Tavern in Manhattan and the 10 O'clock Burger of Holeman & Finch in Atlanta (In-N-Out holds a spot near the top as well, but for totally different reasons). The burger was perfectly cooked and rich without being fatty and the foie gras added a beautiful element of creamy caramelization and decadence (gotta get your fix of California foie gras before July 1st!). The shallot reduction was the perfect finish to the structure and the fries were an excellent accompaniment without being too starchy, yet still satisfying.\n\nI will go back to Burger Bar again next time that I am on the west coast and would definitely check out Chef Keller's Las Vegas Burger Bar location next time I am in Sin City.

I didn't get the chance to try it on my last Vegas trip so I was excited to see that he opened one in San Francisco. I am a bit bias since I was rooting for him the whole time during his run on Top Chef Masters. However, even that favoritism cannot earn Burger Bar a good review due the very poor service and the extremely overpriced burgers. \n\nIt's hard to argue with the location of this Burger Bar. The 6th floor of Macy's downtown gives diners a wonderful view of Union Square. The view is great especially during the holidays because of the ice rink below. Knowing how busy this place can get, we called ahead and they held a table for a party of five even though their website says they only take reservations for parties of 13 or more. Once we got there, we were a little late and they had just called our table, but they accommodated us pretty quickly. The booth seating is both impressive and practical. There are coat hangers on the sides and the best part is the built in television set, which was set on the football game.\n\nAfter being quickly seated, this is when it all went downhill. Service was extremely slow and poor. While our milkshakes came out pretty quickly, we had to wait a while for the burgers. When the burgers did come, mine was split into two orders, which I didn't ask for. It didn't really make sense since each person ordered one burger so why would we have one split into two orders? They didn't apologize for the mix up and I ended up eating a split burger. I think the delay resulted in an overcooked burger. But everyone's burgers were overdone compared to what they asked for. Apparently medium means medium-well and medium rare means medium, etc. The sweet potato fries were also dry and soggy at the same time, a result of the wait time. The highlights of the meal were the Nutella milkshake and the peppercorn cream sauce. I think the sauce would be more practical if it had been put in a small dipping cup over a pouring jug. If you love hazelnut, the milkshake is like drinking liquid Nutella.\n\nOverall, the food did not merit the price paid. I've also never been to a place where they charge to split something like a milkshake. Our server didn't even check on us once until the very end. I understand that it's a new restaurant and the kinks will be worked out. But it was still a disappointing meal and I think I would have gotten great satisfaction eating at Red Robin.

But the promise of good meat and milkshakes spurred me on in spite of it all.\n\nWhen we arrived we heeded a fellow yelper's advice to avoid the elevator...it takes forever and people really jam themselves in there!  So we scurried up the escalators without any problems.  We checked in and were told that the wait was 45 to 60 min.  So we wandered about the china and glassware department to make fun of the crap they sell at Macys...really, who buys a casarole dish with a lid shaped like a bunny?!?!  After a while we just loitered near the door and listened for our party of 6 to be called.  To our surprise, we were seated in about 30 minutes.  WOW!  Didn't see that coming.\n\nWe got a nice table right in front of the milkshake bar.  Our orders were taken promptly and our drinks came out before we knew it.  My caramel latte shake was fantastic.  Very smooth and creamy...not  a super thick consistency that requires vacuum suction to get up the straw.  My only complaint is that for an $8 shake, the portion could have been more generous.\n\nOur food came to us fairly quickly.  The food itself was good.  Not out of this world, but not bad either.  I mean, they're burgers!  I had the sliders and they were tasty, nicely presented and filling.  They came with skinny fries that were good, but I have had better.  My friends had a variety of burgers:  buffalo, angus, kobe.  Again, all very good.  One person thought her burger was a little over cooked, but the truffle sauce more than made up for it.  The sides were pretty good, too.  The sweet potato fries were great and so were the onion rings.  The fried zucchini were good and even better dipped in the aioli.  My friends reported that the fried pickles were a bit disappointing...I didn't try them myself because, well, they were fried pickles.  eeww.  \n\nI will definitely want to come back to try some other things on the menu.  The Peppercorn cream sauce was calling to me.  As was the Surf & Turf Burger (a burger with half a lobster on it...HALF A LOBSTER!!!)\n\nAs for price, yes, it's very spendy.  But when you go to a place like that, what do you expect?!  It's in Macy's for godssakes!  You're paying for the Hubert Keller name, the view and all the fluff.  But I think people have overlooked the fact that you are also paying for some quality ingredients that go into these burgers (even though they are just burgers).  Foie Gras and truffles ain't cheap (but they are oh, so good!).\n\nOur server was a very nice young woman who checked on us often and was not judging as we greedily slurped up our truffle sauce.  A small troop of servers helped her bring our food to us so it all hit the table at the same time:  one of my standards of excellent service.\n\nWill I go back to Burger Bar?  Yes (remember, half a lobster!).  Will I go there often, No.  It's a good place to go, but it's definitely a special occasion kind of thing.

The veggie patty had a lot going on and in a good way. I was extremely full and satisfied. One thing that also stood out to me was the bun. The bun can make or break a burger and this was super fresh from the Italian French Baking Company and enhanced the burger.

You kind of feel like you are in a sports bar yet you still have plenty of privacy to enjoy a laid back dinner amongst friends and family. Burger Bar is a great alternative to Cheesecake Factory in Macy's. It's the same amount of fun without the long wait time. Just don't forget your wallet. The burgers are not cheap.\n\nI originally booked Burger Bar for a girls' night out but then one girl's hubby came along which was totally cool because Burger Bar is the perfect spot for both sexes. Burgers, beer, sports and shopping. Burger Bar is in a great location and the burger menu is endless.\n\nSome of our group built their own burgers. I went for the Hubert Keller burger. It was my first time eating buffalo. The buffalo meat was lean, full of flavor and juicy. It was topped with caramelized onions, spinach and bleu cheese. The Hubert Keller burger was an interesting combination in my opinion and it surprisingly worked very well. If I ever go back to Burger Bar, I'll get it again. The ciabatta held up nicely and my favorite was the side of skinny fries. The fries were held in a wire basket which looked like a miniature shopping cart. \n\nOur mama-to-be got a Nutella milkshake.

"], "author": "Alice A.", "review": "What makes one hamburger better than the next?\n\nObviously this is subjective, but for me I would like:\na toasted bun that does not have hard crust (that means no baguette please), \na good quality beef patty that is between 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick (after cooking), cooked to medium and has good texture and meaty taste, \nsome vegetables (I will take lettuce, tomato and some form of onions), \nsome sauce to bind them together (mayo is fine but I can take aioli or thousand island dressing, too) and \nbe structurally sound (the whole thing needs to stay together in a stack while I am eating).\n\nWhat makes a burger exceptional for me is if one or more of these ingredients really stand out to make the experience memorable.  I did not expect a Fleur-de-Lys experience at Burger Bar SF in terms of service or atmosphere.  If I wanted a fancy Hubert Keller experience I would have booked a table at Fleur de Lys but that's for another time.\n\nI went back to Burger Bar SF and had the much-discussed Rossini burger.  Yes, it comes with Kobe beef, foie gras, and shaved truffles.  Yes, it is $60.  More than anything  I loved the concept of pushing the limits of flavor profiles of burgers. \n\nThe Rossini burger came out on a big plate with a side of  au jus, sea salt, black pepper, and skinny fries.  The truffle aroma was instantly released when I poured what I assumed was a truffle au jus.  I love that earthy smell.  Foie gras  added decadent richness, and the Kobe beef was perfectly cooked to medium doneness and had more of a \"chopped\" texture than the average ground meat texture and it tasted fantastic.   \n\nWas it better than the sum of its parts?  This is what made me think about this experience for two days and a visit to another one of my favorite burger places over the weekend, to mull it over.  In the end I felt  that the three kings of flavors were competing for attention and they did not necessarily come together as well as I had hoped.  \n\nBecause it is a burger I have to put the meat first.  And I realized they had to go with Kobe beef for it to stand against the truffle and foie gras.  The truffle and au jus were great flavor enhancers for the meat, but that left the poor foie gras out in the cold.  I like the classic pairing of foie gras with something sweet and fruity to offset its richness, but in this case the contrast was lacking.  Structurally it fell a little short, too,  because while the onion bun was a good choice for this ensemble, I don't think it was toasted, and it became soggy after the  au jus.  I ate my burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nNonetheless, I was happy with the experience.  Why?  Because it made me think for TWO whole days!  \n\nIncidentally you could get the truffle as a side with their other burgers at $30.  they have some interesting alcoholic and nonalcoholic milk shake options in addition to other beverage options.  I also had a dessert chocolate burger in which chocolate mousse serves as a 'meat' in a donut pastry 'bun'.  Cute. \n\nI am still a fan.

When I heard there was a fancy burger bar that recently opened in town, I had to check it out.  I've seen Hubert Keller perform on Top Chef Masters and boy was I impressed.  While I haven't had the privilege of eating at Fleur de Lys, I can imagine it is wonderful.  I figured this may be a chance to try something more recession friendly.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, it seemed like a casual place, so I marched over to Macy's and rode the elevator up to the sky.  This restaurant is interesting because it is literally In Macy's.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the lighting was excessively bright.  The easiest way to make a restaurant classier is to dim the lights.  What you can't see won't hurt you.  And everyone has heard the expression, everyone looks good in the dark.  On a side note, ladies, always go on a first date in a dimly lit restaurant because you will look hot.  As I was thinking this, they did dim the lights, which they probably do at the start of evening.  \n\nI sat at the bar where it was easy to find a seat, but hard to find service.  The two bartenders were about twelve years old and both ignored me.  I had to find an abandoned menu from some previous patrons and ask for service every time I wanted to order something.\n\nThe menu is a la carte with a few predetermined burgers on the other side of the menu.  However, if you order from the fixed menu there is a strict 'no substitutions' policy, which seems a bit ridiculous.  I also noticed some sweet burgers for dessert, like a chocolate burger.\n\nI ordered an a la carte burger, which nearly resembled the Classic burger, with a few changes.  It took a while to order a drink after that because I was getting no service.  I did hear that they were short staffed one bartender, but the two that were there did not seem very skilled.  Watching them tap a few beers was embarrassing.  I have never seen anyone pour so much head on multiple beers and then serve them to guests.\n\nWhen my burger did arrive, it was short my order of sweet potato fries.  I reminded the bartender that I had ordered them, and he had neglected to put this order in.  I tried to eat my burger slowly while I waited for the fries, but as my burger turned cold, I reminded a server about my fries and he brought some for me.\n\nThe burger itself was middle of the road.  I ordered it medium, but it was about medium well, which is okay with me.  The burger was the perfect size, not too big, not too small, with a thick pattie.  However, I found the meat crumbly, rather than juicy.  The bread was nice and the condiments satisfactory.  I love sweet potato fries, so they were probably the best part of the meal.  The selection of beers is very extensive, another highlight.\n\nThis seems like a nice place to eat while downtown, and I would come back to try some other burgers, but the service begs improvement.  I am surprised to hear that Hubert Keller is on site running this ship, because it feels more like a Cheesecake Factory or another chain.  At one point during my meal, the previously dimmed lights had a minor 'malfunction' and came back on, to everyone's surprise.  It was one of those aha moments, perhaps indicative of the service and inconsistency.

They did assure me that there will be plenty of tables to accommodate our party and true to their word, we were seated promptly upon our arrival.\n\nThe infinite number of burger combinations was too overwhelming for me so I ended up ordering the Burger Bar Sliders.  The buffalo with caramelized onions was definitely my favorite.  I've never had buffalo meat before until today and knowing how lean it is, I half-expected it to be dry but contrarily, it was was moist and juicy.  The Angus beef with bacon was pretty good too but the Country Natural beef was nothing special at all.  I subbed the skinny fries with sweet potato fries and those were pretty yummy ~ not greasy at all.\n\nMost of the people in my party seemed to enjoy their burgers as well, with the exception of one person who ordered the Chef's Veggie Burger (with lentils, peas, brown and white rice, etc...doesn't sound appetizing at all).  But then again, who would expect that to be good?  If you are a vegetarian/vegan, then you are probably better off with the Vegas Vegan (with grilled zucchini, eggplant, tomato and peppers sandwiched between two portabella mushrooms), as another coworker who ordered it said it was delish.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Milkshake Sampler Paddle, which consisted of two chocolate, two coffee and two strawberry shakes.

I guess we got lucky that two adjoining tables happened to open up simultaneously.\n\nSince it was a birthday, we decided to splurge and go all out. I got the kobe beef hamburger with \"fat fries\" (aren't all fries fattening?) and a mint chocolate chip milkshake, which includes creme de menth (I think ... some sort of alcohol, at least).\n\nMy kobe beef was excellent, but a little too rare. I ordered medium rare and another friend ordered medium. Both of ours seemed pretty rare. Maybe it's the style to cook kobe on the rare side? It seemed to only be that way for those of us who ordered the kobe beef. Anyway, it was excellent but I would probably err more on the cooked side by ordering a medium or medium well in the future.\n\nI *love* that some of their milkshakes include alcohol. But it's not a lot. I really wanted to be able to change my FB status to say that I was getting tipsy on a milkshake, but the truth is, I'd probably explode if I drank enough milkshakes to get a buzz. However, the sugar rush had me trembling. That was one decadent shake! Another friend got a beer float. Not root beer, real beer. Actually, it sounds rather gross to me, but he enjoyed it. \n\nOne friend who came with us is vegan. (I know, why would a VEGAN go to burger bar? Because it was a birthday and that was the plan.) For people who don't eat red meat, there are many other options like salmon, lobster, and chicken. For vegetarians, there are other veggie burger options, but they include cheese so they aren't appropriate for vegans. There were a few vegan options, but they included some ingrediants that my friend didn't care for (like eggplant).

The chocolate was a bit too thick for my liking, but I appreciated the playful take on a sweet burger. \n\nWhile I liked the food well enough (and the service was acceptable too), I don't think I'd return any time soon. The total price just isn't worth the quality of product. If prices were lower or the quality was significantly higher, it would be a different story.
