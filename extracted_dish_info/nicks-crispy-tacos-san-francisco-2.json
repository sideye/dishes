The large fish filet is fried to a crispy and golden brown. The guac not only adds creaminess but sort of acts as the glue that holds it all together.

Averages about 4% more on Caviar than from what's listed on Nick's online menu.

Though most of the tacos are served in corn tortillas, one has the option to get some Taco Bell nostalgia and go 'dorado with crispy shells and all.\n\nIn terms of taco meats, I can vouch for their carnitas, pollo asado, and dare I say the camerones, aka shrimp. Everything is seasoned well and served in abundance enough not to feel jipped. For the non-taco variety, beware of the jalapeno \"poppers\" which have been known to light up tastebuds on occasion.

This place is just a few blocks away from me, and I have tried a large percentage of the items over the years- and their food is great overall. But there are a few 'must haves' which I almost always find myself ordering these days.\n\nI love their 'Pescado' burritos- they make Fried or Grilled fish, stuffed with chopped cabbage, onions, cilantro, a tangy mildly spicy sauce, and you can add rice, guac, or other items.  I usually order the fried version (adds a nice crunch!) and I  believe they use either Mahi Mahi or Snapper. To me, this is the top item on the menu and distinguishes their otherwise good menu from the selections at most taco & burrito joints.  Also, I am a big fan of their spicy gooey cheesy 'elote' corn- I find this item delicious as well.m  My wife swears by the carnitas quesadilla....\n\nA few quick pointers- Nick's does take out, and sometimes when I go and the line is super long, rather than wait in line, sometimes I call and place a take-out order instead.  And sometimes they don't answer their phone.  When I do have takeout- catch someone's attention behind the counter and you can usually grab your takeout without enduring the line just to pay.  Remember Nick's only takes cash!\n\nNick's started off being 'the only' option for Mexican in the general area, and it got my business for that reason.

I wish NYC make some amazing fish tacos like this. We've also tried the Pescado burrito, which is the same as the taco version, only this was in burrito form. However, the taco was no doubt better than the burrito. Since I'm at a Mexican restaurant, it's a must to order an elote (grill corn) with grated cheese and chilli powder. The corn was good, but honestly I had better back in NYC.\n\nOverall, I loved the food here, especially the fish taco. Darn, wish I was in this part of town right now, just so I can experience the fresh guac and fish taco again. I guess I'll go out and get some NY style thin crust pizza instead, which is something that I didn't find in California =)", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Carnitas tacos done Nick's Way and an elote.

I had been eating Rubios at least 2-3 times a month thinking it was the greatest thing on earth. Boy, was I wrong. Now, stepping into another Rubios would be blasphemous to the fish taco gods.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe decor at Nick's Crispy Taco's is actually unexpected. The hipster-style interior is gaudy red with crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The restaurants double life consists of a heavenly taco place by day, the trendy nightclub Rouge by night.\n\nThe food:\n\nI only stick to what I know is good here - pescado (fish) tacos \"Nick's Way\" ($5), an elote (corn) and a horchata (rice drink).\n\nPescado Tacos - When you order this, you MUST order it \"Nick's Way,\" which is about $1 more. Trust me, it's completely worth it. \"Nick's Way\" is an extra crispy-fried corn tortilla wrapped with a soft tortilla with jack cheese and guacamole in addition to your choice of filling. These are the best fish taco's I've ever had and any other fish taco I've had since has never come close.\n\nThe pescado taco consists of a layer of cabbage and red onions, Baja-style fried white fish, fresh guacamole, lime mayonnaise, salsa and cilantro. The tacos are enormous, so you can get away with one if you're looking for a light meal. If you like spicy, ask for the habanero sauce. They keep that hidden in the back and it'll add a huge kick to the taco.\n\nElote - I LOVE Mexican corn. I get this any time I'm at a county fair. Mexican corn is grilled corn rubbed any kind of seasoning. This one specifically had butter and topped with Mexican cheese, chili powder and cayanne pepper. It's so rich and creamy, and mucho deliciouso. It really does make this healthy grain/vegetable unhealthy for you.\n\nHorchata - Horchata is a Mexican sweet rice drink flavored with cinnamon and other spices. It pretty much tastes like the left over milk after a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It's a little chalky, but I still love it.\n\nThe Nick from Nick's Crispy Taco's is actually at Underdogs on Irving now. They pretty much serve the same menu, including the famous fish tacos. I like to go there since it's more convenient for me, but parking is pretty rough during certain times of the day.\n\nI shake my fist at NIck's Crispy Taco's for setting my fish taco standards so high.

This place is just a few blocks away from me, and I have tried a large percentage of the items over the years- and their food is great overall. But there are a few 'must haves' which I almost always find myself ordering these days.\n\nI love their 'Pescado' burritos- they make Fried or Grilled fish, stuffed with chopped cabbage, onions, cilantro, a tangy mildly spicy sauce, and you can add rice, guac, or other items.  I usually order the fried version (adds a nice crunch!) and I  believe they use either Mahi Mahi or Snapper. To me, this is the top item on the menu and distinguishes their otherwise good menu from the selections at most taco & burrito joints.  Also, I am a big fan of their spicy gooey cheesy 'elote' corn- I find this item delicious as well.m  My wife swears by the carnitas quesadilla....\n\nA few quick pointers- Nick's does take out, and sometimes when I go and the line is super long, rather than wait in line, sometimes I call and place a take-out order instead.  And sometimes they don't answer their phone.  When I do have takeout- catch someone's attention behind the counter and you can usually grab your takeout without enduring the line just to pay.  Remember Nick's only takes cash!\n\nNick's started off being 'the only' option for Mexican in the general area, and it got my business for that reason.

Funky, flavorful and a little unconventional.\n\nThe carne asada taco is excellent. Juicy and crispy at the same time. I was more impressed by the fish taco which is baja style. It can hang with the top taco joints in San Diego. Fried fish rolled up \"Nick's style\" is the way to do it.

Kind of pricey for just one taco. And it didn't fill me up, but I know two of these would be hard to finish all by myself. Anyway, it was delicious! Very crispy fish, creamy lime mayo, and a crunchy shell. Downside, guacamole only covered half the taco since the other half was still covered in the wrapper.  Every bite of my Pescado Taco = a drip of sauce in my basket. Took one bite of my bf's Pollo Taco, Nick's Way. Love that they used white meat, didn't like how chewy and kind of dry it was. Service is good, with a friendly staff. You order up front, pay, take a number, find a seat, get your food delivered to your table, enjoy, and they even bus for you. It'd be nicer if Taco Tuesdays were all day long.

Fresh tomatoes and onions are way better than the pureed version that could have been sitting out for awhile.\n\nNachos with Carne Asada: \nSuper yummy, with black beans, meat, and cheese. I have to admit that the cheese was a weird consistency, but still very tasty! It was more of a cream that was broken leading to a grainy texture.

My sister complained about her iced tea....  it went to worst quickly. The carnitas taco I ordered was warm, and the meat was either microwaved too long to heat it up, or just plain over-cooked; it was terrible and with or without sauce, the stringy meat had NO flavor, no taste and no substance. The beans were cold - the menu states: BRAiSED shredded pork...  well, if this was braised perhaps they used an oven that resembled the engine of a Ford? The bean & cheese burrito my sister had was steamed - so she says - and had no flavor also. However, on the one tiny good point, the poppers she ordered was steaming hot out of the deep fryer and she liked that! YUCK. As I waited for sis to finish her \"food\", I watched as two guys at the bar tried to order but couldn't attract the attention of the gal, too busy chatting with a friend and laughing so much she couldn't hear these two guys calling her from 10feet away. \n\nThe place reeks of a Las Vegas nightclub nightmare, and is the first place I've ever seen in my life with red carpeting on the ceiling. Looks like nothing is spent on maintenance of the place, so they'll use the location till it falls down and then a bit longer. They could try cleaning the place WELL, other than wiping everything onto the seats and floors.\n\nIt's truly the FIRST place I've been to during my two-year time in the states where I wish I hadn't walked into the place.

The steak wasn't overly salty, and the guacamole was very smooth and creamy. Each of the tables had bottles of red salsa and a salsa verde, which had a slight spice to it. The tacos were tasty on their own without the sauces, but if you want your tacos to have a kick to it, add the salsas. \n\nThe strawberry agua fresca was very refreshing. I could actually taste real strawberry as opposed to strawberry syrup. The horchata, which is one of my favorite drinks, was actually rather disappointing.

It was overly sweet and felt like it coated my mouth because it was thicker than I was used to.\n\nUnfortunately, they messed up my brother's order and gave him a pescado taco instead of the pollo asado taco.

I think it's the Healthy SF surcharge or sit-in-tax, but I'm not sure.  For example, when I get a pescado taco (not nick's way) it's normally $4.50, but when I pay, I have to pay $5.50.  With tax, it should no more than $5 dollars.  I'm surprised out of all the reviews on yelp, nobody has mentioned this.  Most restaurants in the city will notify customers of extra surcharges (especially for Healthy SF), but as far as I've experienced, I haven't seen any notification at Nick's since the last 2 years I've been coming here.  A little shady on their end. \n\nAll in all, Nick's is good if you come at an off-time (i.e. between lunch and dinner is a good time) so that you can get a table and can have fresher (not soggy or as soggy) food.  Taco Tuesdays are ALWAYS packed (so come early, otherwise you won't get a seat).  Going on days when there are pub crawls is JUST as packed.  \n\nThis place is still cash only, so bring cash!  You will also get charged extra for some unknown fee, so don't be surprised when your total comes out to be $1-2 extra (after 9.50% tax).  It would be nice to know what that extra unknown surcharge is though, but I guess it'll remain unknown in their shady books.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-05-02"}, {"excerpts": ["We had ordered a Pescado taco, which is baja style fried fish in a corn tortilla with salsa, lime mayonnaise, cilantro, cabbage & onions.

So, we hailed the floor manager, who unapologetically explained to us that even though we had reservations, the new group was allowed to take our table. And, that \"unfortunately,\" the decision was above her. \n\nWhen asked if some higher-up was sleeping with, dating, or somehow involved with a girl in that group, the floor manager said, \"yes.\"\n\nI'm sorry, what just happened?? \n\nSo, all 10-15 of us were sent to a table suitable for 5. After 45 minutes of fitting 5 pitchers, a huge group of people, and a truckload of food on that puny table, the floor manager informed us that she had convinced the group of girls to swap with us.\n\nAt that point, we were so peeved and disappointed that, although we took the offer, it didn't really make up for the lack of professionalism and customer service.\n\nSo, that's what the two stars are for. Awful, awful handling of a ridiculous situation.

Now, stepping into another Rubios would be blasphemous to the fish taco gods.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe decor at Nick's Crispy Taco's is actually unexpected. The hipster-style interior is gaudy red with crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The restaurants double life consists of a heavenly taco place by day, the trendy nightclub Rouge by night.\n\nThe food:\n\nI only stick to what I know is good here - pescado (fish) tacos \"Nick's Way\" ($5), an elote (corn) and a horchata (rice drink).\n\nPescado Tacos - When you order this, you MUST order it \"Nick's Way,\" which is about $1 more. Trust me, it's completely worth it. \"Nick's Way\" is an extra crispy-fried corn tortilla wrapped with a soft tortilla with jack cheese and guacamole in addition to your choice of filling. These are the best fish taco's I've ever had and any other fish taco I've had since has never come close.\n\nThe pescado taco consists of a layer of cabbage and red onions, Baja-style fried white fish, fresh guacamole, lime mayonnaise, salsa and cilantro. The tacos are enormous, so you can get away with one if you're looking for a light meal. If you like spicy, ask for the habanero sauce. They keep that hidden in the back and it'll add a huge kick to the taco.\n\nElote - I LOVE Mexican corn. I get this any time I'm at a county fair. Mexican corn is grilled corn rubbed any kind of seasoning. This one specifically had butter and topped with Mexican cheese, chili powder and cayanne pepper. It's so rich and creamy, and mucho deliciouso.

Warm tortilla, filled with a crispy HOT fish fillet, guacamole, shredded cabbage and some yummy mayo-type sauce. It was honestly delicious. We barely talked to each other while eating it besides mumbling \"Mmmmm\" in-between bites. \nI'm not sure what the plain pescado taco is comprised of... but just go with the \"Nick's way\" option. Their guacamole is reason enough. \nThese are pretty big tacos too, at $4 each... and worth every penny. \n\nOh - this place is also really pretty.

The grilled fish was pretty good too and the piece of fish was generous. \n\nBest thing was the chips and salsa with a scoop of guacamole. I would've been happy with more guac, but for $4, you really can't complain. The pico de gallo was piled high on thick chips. I couldn't stop stuffing my face with them. One person in our group got the quesadilla, which was the biggest quesadilla I've ever seen, and I'm not just saying that to be polite. Someone else got chicken tacos, which she liked. And GL got baja style fish and carnitas. He said he didn't really like the flavor of the carnitas, but it also could've been because it was Nick's way too. That just wasn't a favorite at our table.\n\nGreat experience, friendly service and I'm still thinking about the chips and salsa.

My one minor complaint is that it was a little too heavy on the cilantro, not my favorite.\n\nEven better is the $3.25 Pescado Taco, which they describe as a Baja-style fried fish, again in a corn tortilla but with spicier salsas, a lime-flavored mayonnaise, cilantro, shredded cabbage and onions. Both were delish. And for just 75 cents more, you can have them Nick's Way which means they pan fry them with cheese and guacamole...sounds wicked good.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, we also tried the $5.50 Carnitas Quesadilla, which replicates Nick's Way in a big way. It had braised shredded pork folded with pico de gallo and melted jack cheese in a pan-fried folded flour tortilla. The pork was not what I expected...it was better...like the kind of pulled pork you'd get at a Kansas City barbecue joint. Most definitely worth a return visit.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars ...surprisingly good tacqueria food\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...like a PALACE!...like a CASTLE!...How nuts would it be to eat dis one or dat one...dis one or dat one!\nSERVICE - 4 stars...pretty quick and responsive when it comes to extra chips\nTOTAL - 4 stars...so remember...You's GOTTA get yourself some CHAN-DE-LIERS ...and some tacos from my Cousin Nick (Nick cracks his knuckles.)", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["When I'm attempting to be healthy, I'll have the grilled fish taco with a Corona Light ", ";)  "], "author": "Dina H.", "review": "I still remember the first time I bit into that fried fish taco ... pure joy!!!!

 are we only supposed to review posh, michelin.starred establishments?  the ritz carlton only has so many restaurants, you know?  so who _are_ these anti.yelp wannabe restaurant critics?  i'm not sure.  however, i realise there _are_ other places to hear about restaurants.  now, i can't say if they're better places to hear about restaurants or not.  well, one place i sometimes find out about restaurants is on pbs kqed's _check_please!_ television show.  my wife watches more tv than i do.  i had watched this show in the past, but i rediscovered it while sitting around with my wife at home during my lunch break from work one day.  yeah, i'm blessed with living close to work and thus can often eat lunch at home, a five.star establishment.  anyway, in case you don't know on _check_please!_ three, normal, non.professional restaurant critics get together and pick three restaurants to introduce to the group as well as the viewing audience.  i suppose you're supposed to pick a restaurant that isn't too obvious.  usually, the group is nice to the first person that introduces his/her restaurant.  then as the show progresses, they start getting meaner and meaner.  then by the last of the three, they're totally bagging on each other's tastes in food.  maybe it's because they drink wine as they talk, and that loosens up the lips over time or something.  in the past, some of my friends said i ought to go on that show.  if i were to go on that show, i really wonder which restaurant i would pick.  in order for it not to be too obvious, maybe it ought to be a santa clara koreatown restaurant.  however, i'm sure the other two in my group would be philistines that don't understand korean food.  after all, i watched a desi guy try to introduce an indian fusion restaurant and some dude that thought he knew indian food tried to rip him up just to be a jerk.  i'm glad that doesn't really happen on yelp.\n\nanyway, i found out about nick's crispy tacos from an episode of _check_please!_.  one girl introduced the restaurant, praising its tortilla soup and well... crispy tacos.  i thought they said each taco had two tortillas, one crispy one within one soft one.  immediately, i thought about the taco bell double decker taco.  ah, crud... now, the san franciscan foodie snobs are throwing their arms up in the air and then pointing at me, shouting and screaming, because i dared mention \"taco bell\" in the middle of a restaurant review.  hey, i'm not the first on this page!  uh, did i dig a deeper hole?  anyway, the other two; since this was the second or third of the three restaurants on the episode; started to bag on this restaurant, saying that the food was messy and nothing special.  from the show, i knew that the restaurant was located in club rouge niteclub.  i knew it had the whole red, palace theme (not \"red palace,\" all one word.  that sounds like some place in russia or china... oh, but a wiki says it's a place in birmingham, england).  i think i also heard on the show that this is a cash.only joint.\n\nwell, this past saturday, my wife had us go to a training session for the academy of friends annual gala.  we worked there on sunday night, selling drink tickets to guests of this black tie benefit for aids/hiv research; apparently, a huge san franciscan tradition on academy awards night.  well, after the training session, we strolled around the marina and then drove over to nick's crispy tacos.  god granted us a prime parking spot right in front of this joint.  the restaurant looked just as it had on tv.  just as i had remembered from the show, they were cash.only; and i never carry that much cash.  i'm a credit card kind of guy because i like to monitor my spending on mint.com.  i realised my limited cash supply would place a firm ceiling on my lunch experience.  i only had $15 to feed the both of us.  since we weren't super hungry, i agreed with my wife that we could just share three tacos.  i ordered one carne asada, one carnitas, and one grilled fish taco.  the polite, young woman behind the counter asked if i wanted them nick's way; but i couldn't afford the additional 95 cents.  aw, crud... now the san franciscan foodie snobs are again jumping up and down and pointing at me.  yeah, i must admit that it's hard to experience an eating establishment fully if you can't buy a complete meal, etc.  thus, i must preface the rest of my review by saying that i hope to return to get the full experience and write a better review.  well, the menu just said that nick's way would add guacamole and cheese to my tacos, and i figured i could do without those for now because i had ingested plenty of homemade guacamole the night before.  i did _not_ realise that forgoing \"nick's way\" would eliminate the double decker taco feature!  oops!

The shrimp were rubbery and just looked old and shriveled.\n\n*Carnitas burrito: braised shredded pork rolled in a flour tortilla with pico de gallo & pinto beans ($8.85), add Guacamole (+$1.50)\nThe roommate ordered this. I thought the carnitas were okay. A little dry.\n\n*Pescado burrito: Baja style fried fish rolled in a flour tortilla with Baja salsas, cilantro, cabbage & onions ($9.60)\nThis was way better than the other burrito. The fish was nice and crunchy. Like having a huge fish taco wrapped up in a flour tortilla.\n\nIf you order through Caviar, they don't really have much of a markup. Averages about 4% more on Caviar than from what's listed on Nick's online menu. It was also great that our driver packed up sides of salsas since I love pouring salsa a whole container per taco.\n\nIf it wasn't for the awful Camarones taco, I'd give Nick's 4 stars.
