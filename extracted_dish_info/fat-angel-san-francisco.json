This place is what a gastro pub should be. Great beer and wine selection and delicious consistent food. It is quite small and very popular.  The combination of small and popular is actually the major drawback of the place.  They do not take reservations so wait times can be upwards of 1-2 hours at times if you want a table for dinner.  You can put your name on a list and they will text you when a table becomes available, but this system may not be ideal for some. Also considering that some people order food and then sit at tables for hours drinking after dinner makes it difficult for the staff to accurately predict wait times.  Also since they have outdoor seating, weather becomes a variable in that on nice days their seating capacity almost doubles.  \n\nThe staff is always very friendly and do their best to accommodate given the limitations listed above.  They are understandably in a tricky situation and there is no great way to make everyone happy!  \n\nWhen you walk in there is a chalkboard that lists the beer and wine on tap.

The outlined food categories nicely fit one page... and it covers the necessities: Appetizers (Angel's Share), Cheese, Meat, Butter, Greens, Flatbread, Plates. The kale salad is unmatched - marcona almonds,  bacon, and the right touch of champagne dressing. No arguments about the chicken pot pie, as it is exactly how I envision a perfect savory pie to be (probably used a cup full of butter to have reached said perfection, but who's caring?). The spicy mac/cheese is pure bliss on a mini skillet. Still want more, you say? The Grape/Gorgonzola/Prosciutto flatbread is the way to go.\n\nAre you judging my diet yet? Did you miss the part about me crushing on a salad? \n\nOh the beers. Amazing beers on tap that rotate frequently based on season and featured microbrews. Some of the best variety offered in SF, but you end up liking one - drink up, as chances are that beer will be gone in 2 days and it may be while until they get another limited batch. They also have an excellent selection of bottled beers that covers a range of palates. Wine on tap more your groove? I've only tried the Sauvignon Blanc (Martella?) and Pinot Noir (Copain), both decent, but in a place like Fat Angel - with all the beer selections and so little time?

Engage them in conversation, and they'll make several recommendations (armed with samples)... after which you complete your selection and indulge happily. Let this be a lesson to other establishments: It pays to have a crew who is knowledgeable and passionate about the very things the place stands for. Need I spell out why?

It is a relatively small menu but everything on it is worth taking a shot at. The areas they excel in are the salads and the flat-breads.

Shout out to whoever is back there whipping up the food.\n\nBy this time you are completely full and realize you haven't even gotten to the main dishes. I have had the sliders and the mac and cheese which are both great as well. The mac and cheese is very spicy so be forewarned if you aren't used to that. \n\nThis place also holds its own as a bar as well. There is a stuff drink menu with plenty of options for the beer aficionados. The wine is pretty varied as well but may not satisfy the wine heads of SF. \n\nThe customer service is great at Fat Angel as well. With easy pay at the bar and personally calling you when your table is ready are great perks. \n\nAlso full disclosure I am in love with the bartender/waitress.I don't know her name but she has short hair and tattoos and is the woman of my dreams.  I am sure she is married or taken but I am professing my love for her here. \n\nThe negatives that could knock off some stars for others are just how small Fat Angel is. It is a really tiny and intimate place and can get crowded on most nights by around 8 or 9pm. I am talking standing room only at the bar and freezing your butt off by choosing to sit at the outside tables because nothing is available inside. Be prepared for a wait time but its never too long. Also the small place leads to some really really close table set ups. You are in the other couples conversation no matter what so be prepared for people watching as you will be two inches from someone else. \n\nFat Angel may have an odd name but as one of my first introductions to social life in SF I couldn't have had a better experience. The service has not dipped in the three years I have been in SF and I would venture to say it won't when you make your way out there as well. \n\nFillmore has a gem that serves a perfect wine and candlelight home with food that leaves you coming back for more.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "When my bf suggested going to Fat Angel, I didn't jump on the idea because I probably subconsciously thought it implied something about myself. Fast forward two years, and my friends and I are wandering about Pac Heights and I suggest Fat Angel. We snagged the last table, I received compliments for my recommendation, and my response was that it was actually my bf's rec. Moral of the story: Don't take restaurant names too seriously, and listen to recommendations by your SO. \n\nThe alcoholic menu is extensive and overwhelming, in a good way. They have amazing wine and beer selections from all over the world. It's somewhat pricier, but they also have less expensive options for the rest of us peasants. The cocktail menu is short but intriguing, with a beer or wine base. There is a list of rotating draft beer and wine as well.\n\n(+) We started off with a cheese and charcuterie board ($16 + $18 for 3 meats and 3 cheeses). It was beautifully laid out, with little dabs of spicy nuts, jams, honey, and whole grain mustard to mix it up.\n- Brie was quite standard and the piece was small\n- Pecorino and machego were good, not too strong but subtle\n- Finocchio was like a fatty salami. Tasty, but may not be the best if you're on a diet\n- The spicy prosciutto spread was more like a meat jam, and was also a somewhat small quantity. If you are craving something prosciutto-y, I suggest the speck or the bresaola. Tastes deliciously cured\n- The bread came in a paper bag on the side. Would have liked it on a board for Instagram purposes, and in fact I think it comes on the same board if you don't order as much stuff for your board\n\n(++) The tomato, spicy sausage, arugula, and Parmesan flatbread ($15) turned out more impressive than your standard flatbread. The bread is so miraculously thin it's almost like eating a cracker with a myriad of toppings with contrasting flavors. I bet this is what pizza tastes like in heaven for fat angels (....get it?)\n\n(+++) We got their popular FA chicken pot pie ($14). I'm not sure if I've ever had fancy chicken pot pie (I can only think of the frozen ones from my childhood and that my roommate in college used to microwave). But FA has created quite a gastropub-worthy version with roasted chicken and assorted veggies, spiked with sherry and tarragon, and topped with a flaky puff pastry. It's savory and herby, with contrasting textures, a tad of creaminess without being too heavy, and a bit of nostalgia.\n\nThe server was helpful in her suggestions for the charcuterie board, never rushed us (even though we were taking a long time chatting after dinner and there was a wait on the Friday), and split the check 3 ways for us. It totaled to slightly above $40 each, for a glass of wine and a lot of food.\n\nThe ambiance is vintage and cool: marble tables, a chandelier with a statement, and a small patio for better food lighting. FA is a place I would come back to, in order to try the different drinks and noms. Plus, their menu has variation and is printed daily. (at least until SF bans non-reusable menus)\n\nMy minor complaints are that my friend noticed a bit of lipstick stain left on her cup, and that there were little fruit flies including one that landed in my wine glass. Good thing I finished it quickly. \n\nOther tips:\n- Happy hour is 4-6pm weekdays, $1 off wine/beer and $2 off flatbreads\n- It's a short walk from Jtown and Social Study, so there are great options for more drinks/things to do afterwards\n- Not really great for large groups since it's fairly small. I'd say not to come with more than 6ish people\n- Other dishes that look amazing are the greens (it a huggggggeee  fluffy salad) and spicy mac n cheese (comes in a skillet, of course)\n\nFun fact: it's owned by the same group as Trestle, Stone's Throw, and Corridor, and it indeed has the same wow factor.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["But the chicken pot pie is phenomenal!  \n\n"], "author": "Aaron W.", "review": "The Mac and cheese is good.\n\nThe ceased salad is good.\n\nBut the chicken pot pie is phenomenal!  \n\nGreat food!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-06-27"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorite dish to order here is the signature Chicken Pot Pie.

If interested in food and drinks that borders on the unfamiliar, look somewhere else. The reason why I love Fat Angel is that it succeeds in what may quaint neighborhood jaunts fail to do: keep things simple and classy. Fat Angel serves up tastes and an ambiance that is comfortable and recognizable. This restaurant doesn't attempt to be something it's not.\n\nSince I discovered this place over a year ago, I visit the establishment about once per month. Of all San Francisco restaurants, this would be my most visited and the place I most often take friends for a light, casual dinner. My friends always leave commenting how much they are \"surprised\" by the food and ambiance of this hidden gem of a bar/restaurant. \n\nMy 'go-to' meal here is the Fat Angel Chicken Pot Pie, with roasted carrots, chicken, sherry and tarragon ($14). Their bread is less like a biscuit, more like a croissant. I think the light, flakey texture of bread choice is key for this dish. The contents themselves are thick and creamy, without leaving you stuffed. When I need to eat emotionally, I crave this chicken pot pie.\n\nSome other dishes I have tried that I have enjoyed greatly are the Spicy Mac N' Cheese, with gruy\u00e8re, cheddar and parmiggiano-reggiano ($12), the Baby Kale, minus bacon, marcona almonds and Parmesan ($12). \n\nAs for drinks, I encourage you to be adventurous and try something new every time. I am never disappointed. \n\nThe service here is impeccable. The bar and wait staff is a tightly-knit family. If you show your face here often enough, they'll recognize you, remember your tastes and give you recommendations for navigating their beer and wine lists. The team is also lightning fast at delivering your food, checking up on you, and bringing you the bill whenever ready. \n\nAs has been mentioned in other reviews, this place should be listed as a bar, not a restaurant. Think of it as a bar with bites on par. \n\nThere's limited seating here, with most tables set for two. Perfect for a date night; not ideal for a family dinner.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-08-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I've heard their chicken pot pie was good but wasn't able to try it.

Let this be a lesson to other establishments: It pays to have a crew who is knowledgeable and passionate about the very things the place stands for. Need I spell out why?

This was served with a great rye bread, and was so delicious. Like cinnamoney-nutella. Spread like butter, and was soft.\n\nThen we had 2 flatbreads: (1) Roasted red grape, walnut, & prosciutto w/ Gorgonzola, which was lovely. The roasted grapes are a favorite thing of mine that not many places do. It adds a hint of sweet to something that feels savory. It's great. (2) Wild mushroom and white truffle oil w/pecorino.

In addition to regular exercise and healthy eating, we recently cut out processed carbs and unnecessary sugars after 6pm. One day, I just couldn't take it anymore. So, we went to Fat Angel since it was two blocks away. It was packed on a cold, dreary night. Nobody appeared to be hosting or seating people, so I made my way to an empty table and sat down. Not knowing if this was acceptable behavior at Fat Angel, I kind of went with it and went to town with the carbs. LOL.\n\nWe had the Pimm's cup and the Champagne cocktail for drinks. Neither of which were to die for. We then ordered the mac-n-cheese, chicken pot pie and sliders. The sliders had a good cook on them and were tasty. The chicken pot pie was yummy, but there wasn't enough crust and therefore, too much filling. The filling, however, did have a good amount of shredded chicken which I was glad they didn't skimp on. The mac-n-cheese was okay. It was served in a hot skillet which made scooping and serving the dish a bit difficult (there was no pan holder or hot glove to help in handling it). The Mister didn't take to the mac-n-cheese and said he could have made it himself. Although a fair assessment as far as difficulty of the dish, the Mister rarely cooks...yeah, go figure! Kettle meet pot. \n\nThe service at Fat Angel was good, but the envirnoment was too cramped for our style. Other table's conversations were bleeding into ours, coercing silence.

The portion is large enough for two, so one can try other things on their limited menu.

Fast forward two years, and my friends and I are wandering about Pac Heights and I suggest Fat Angel. We snagged the last table, I received compliments for my recommendation, and my response was that it was actually my bf's rec. Moral of the story: Don't take restaurant names too seriously, and listen to recommendations by your SO. \n\nThe alcoholic menu is extensive and overwhelming, in a good way. They have amazing wine and beer selections from all over the world. It's somewhat pricier, but they also have less expensive options for the rest of us peasants. The cocktail menu is short but intriguing, with a beer or wine base. There is a list of rotating draft beer and wine as well.\n\n(+) We started off with a cheese and charcuterie board ($16 + $18 for 3 meats and 3 cheeses). It was beautifully laid out, with little dabs of spicy nuts, jams, honey, and whole grain mustard to mix it up.\n- Brie was quite standard and the piece was small\n- Pecorino and machego were good, not too strong but subtle\n- Finocchio was like a fatty salami. Tasty, but may not be the best if you're on a diet\n- The spicy prosciutto spread was more like a meat jam, and was also a somewhat small quantity. If you are craving something prosciutto-y, I suggest the speck or the bresaola. Tastes deliciously cured\n- The bread came in a paper bag on the side. Would have liked it on a board for Instagram purposes, and in fact I think it comes on the same board if you don't order as much stuff for your board\n\n(++) The tomato, spicy sausage, arugula, and Parmesan flatbread ($15) turned out more impressive than your standard flatbread. The bread is so miraculously thin it's almost like eating a cracker with a myriad of toppings with contrasting flavors. I bet this is what pizza tastes like in heaven for fat angels (....get it?)\n\n(+++) We got their popular FA chicken pot pie ($14). I'm not sure if I've ever had fancy chicken pot pie (I can only think of the frozen ones from my childhood and that my roommate in college used to microwave). But FA has created quite a gastropub-worthy version with roasted chicken and assorted veggies, spiked with sherry and tarragon, and topped with a flaky puff pastry. It's savory and herby, with contrasting textures, a tad of creaminess without being too heavy, and a bit of nostalgia.\n\nThe server was helpful in her suggestions for the charcuterie board, never rushed us (even though we were taking a long time chatting after dinner and there was a wait on the Friday), and split the check 3 ways for us. It totaled to slightly above $40 each, for a glass of wine and a lot of food.\n\nThe ambiance is vintage and cool: marble tables, a chandelier with a statement, and a small patio for better food lighting. FA is a place I would come back to, in order to try the different drinks and noms. Plus, their menu has variation and is printed daily. (at least until SF bans non-reusable menus)\n\nMy minor complaints are that my friend noticed a bit of lipstick stain left on her cup, and that there were little fruit flies including one that landed in my wine glass. Good thing I finished it quickly. \n\nOther tips:\n- Happy hour is 4-6pm weekdays, $1 off wine/beer and $2 off flatbreads\n- It's a short walk from Jtown and Social Study, so there are great options for more drinks/things to do afterwards\n- Not really great for large groups since it's fairly small. I'd say not to come with more than 6ish people\n- Other dishes that look amazing are the greens (it a huggggggeee  fluffy salad) and spicy mac n cheese (comes in a skillet, of course)\n\nFun fact: it's owned by the same group as Trestle, Stone's Throw, and Corridor, and it indeed has the same wow factor.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the spicy mac n cheese, which was pretty good!

I love the subtle spice of the sausage, the thin crispyness of the crust (which was not at all greasy), and the arugula that paried so well along with the ricotta.  All the ingredients was just the right amount and this plate was a great one for sharing.  I loved it!\n\nMAC 'N CHEESE - $11\nGruy\u00e8re, aged cheddar, parmigiano-reggiano\nI came here for this dish right here.  I\"m happy that it was so spicey like many people thought.  If anything I tasted no spice which was fine.  I loved how the top layer was crispy...and yes this dish was quite greacy...but hey its why I love mac n cheese!  Be careful though, it comes out SUPER hot!  This ooey-gooey cheesy dish was a fave!\n\n\nF.A.'S CHICKEN POT PIE - $12\nRoast chicken, carrots, sherry, tarragon \nI was quite impressed with this one mainly because it didn't look like a pie.  It looked like there was a thick flakey buttery thing of pastry on top and beneath the filling.  Otherwise the filling was out in the open so you see exactly what you're getting.  Just your standard chicken pot pie filling but what made it unique was the \"crust\".  Yum!\n\n3 SLIDERS - $10\nBeef, caramelized onions, bacon, Irish cheddar, aioli\nOh so tasty!  Simple but I appreciate it not being dry.  I love the little pickled peppers it came with...it compliments it SO well.  I felt the aioli tasted like ranch dressing..but its not a complaint.  I enjoyed it.  \n\nIts unfortunate I didn't try any drinks since I feel its their main thing...but I'm happy to have tried their food because it was amazing.  Parking was fairly easy for me (I came around 5:45pm and stayed until 6pm since its free after that).  The restaurant itself is quite small, intimate, but not jam packed.  It does become a full house and I felt we got lucky finding an empty table immediately.

It is a hidden (or not so hidden) gem of San Francisco. It is right off of Fillmore, it is a great spot if you are in the neighborhood. I've been going for about four years, and every time I go I find another great menu item. Mind you the menu is only one page (we aren't talking Cheesecake Factory selections) so hard to believe that I haven't tried it all. But on my last visit I discovered the Chicken Pot Pie. Divine! It may have been my first time trying it, but it certainly won't be my last. It is an open bowl of Chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and the perfect amount of gravy and spices with a nice layer of buttery, flakey crust on the bottom and backed to perfection on the top. Man, I want to go back today just to try it again. It is almost sweet (in a good way) so I do recommend sprinkling with salt and pepper. \n\nThey always have a kick bootie beer selection. And definitely keep them on the radar during sf beer week. Every evening they have a different delicious offering. I sampled five great Paradox beers and on another night 5 Bruery beers poured from bottles. (They had fifteen hard to find beers to choose from, so I had to narrow it down to one sample of five.)\n\nOur fall back food options have always been the bread with flavored butters. The most recent flavors were Bernaise, Chive, Chili, Maple Bacon and Molasses. You can try one for $5.50, three for $15 or all five for I think $25. That is a lot of butter, but I did feel compelled to try them all once and take home the left overs. This last time the Bernaise butter was my favorite. Delish.\n\nWe also love their flatbreads, toppings change seasonally. Most recently we tried the butternut squash and kale. Perfect!\n\nAnd the mac n cheese, is great. Has a tangy hardier taste with the perfect amount of sauce to crunch ratio.\n\nSometimes the prices can get a little steep if you don't pay attention when ordering, you think it may be a quick bite of food and a beer from your local gastropub, and next thing you know your tab is $90.

The owner, who was serving us, was extremely knowledgeable and for my last glass, I made him pick something for me. He ended up picking a beautiful Portuguese wine that was big and bold and fabulous! \n\nThe atmosphere is awesome. Small, quaint, perfect for that girls evening where you want to sit at a table and catch up, or for the predate drink where you are sitting at the bar. The owners also have an amazing taste in music, all his own collection. We made him promise that he would never change the music. The whole bar is made from a church organ he was able to snag from napa, and beautifully restored.\n\nI am so glad my friend stumbled upon this and wanted to share it with myself and our girlfriends. We all had nothing but excellent comments about this place and decided this is probably going to be our go to spot when we want to get together for a drink and hang out. I cannot wait to come back here to hang out, have a glass of wine, and relax. \n\nLike I said, I'm already regretting sharing this place with my fellow yelpers.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-03-24"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the sliders and the Mac n Cheese.

They also offer items for dessert but the 2 times I dined I was way to stuffed to get to that part of the meal. I will definitely have to leave room next time.

Fast forward two years, and my friends and I are wandering about Pac Heights and I suggest Fat Angel. We snagged the last table, I received compliments for my recommendation, and my response was that it was actually my bf's rec. Moral of the story: Don't take restaurant names too seriously, and listen to recommendations by your SO. \n\nThe alcoholic menu is extensive and overwhelming, in a good way. They have amazing wine and beer selections from all over the world. It's somewhat pricier, but they also have less expensive options for the rest of us peasants. The cocktail menu is short but intriguing, with a beer or wine base. There is a list of rotating draft beer and wine as well.\n\n(+) We started off with a cheese and charcuterie board ($16 + $18 for 3 meats and 3 cheeses). It was beautifully laid out, with little dabs of spicy nuts, jams, honey, and whole grain mustard to mix it up.\n- Brie was quite standard and the piece was small\n- Pecorino and machego were good, not too strong but subtle\n- Finocchio was like a fatty salami. Tasty, but may not be the best if you're on a diet\n- The spicy prosciutto spread was more like a meat jam, and was also a somewhat small quantity. If you are craving something prosciutto-y, I suggest the speck or the bresaola. Tastes deliciously cured\n- The bread came in a paper bag on the side. Would have liked it on a board for Instagram purposes, and in fact I think it comes on the same board if you don't order as much stuff for your board\n\n(++) The tomato, spicy sausage, arugula, and Parmesan flatbread ($15) turned out more impressive than your standard flatbread. The bread is so miraculously thin it's almost like eating a cracker with a myriad of toppings with contrasting flavors. I bet this is what pizza tastes like in heaven for fat angels (....get it?)\n\n(+++) We got their popular FA chicken pot pie ($14). I'm not sure if I've ever had fancy chicken pot pie (I can only think of the frozen ones from my childhood and that my roommate in college used to microwave). But FA has created quite a gastropub-worthy version with roasted chicken and assorted veggies, spiked with sherry and tarragon, and topped with a flaky puff pastry. It's savory and herby, with contrasting textures, a tad of creaminess without being too heavy, and a bit of nostalgia.\n\nThe server was helpful in her suggestions for the charcuterie board, never rushed us (even though we were taking a long time chatting after dinner and there was a wait on the Friday), and split the check 3 ways for us. It totaled to slightly above $40 each, for a glass of wine and a lot of food.\n\nThe ambiance is vintage and cool: marble tables, a chandelier with a statement, and a small patio for better food lighting. FA is a place I would come back to, in order to try the different drinks and noms. Plus, their menu has variation and is printed daily. (at least until SF bans non-reusable menus)\n\nMy minor complaints are that my friend noticed a bit of lipstick stain left on her cup, and that there were little fruit flies including one that landed in my wine glass. Good thing I finished it quickly. \n\nOther tips:\n- Happy hour is 4-6pm weekdays, $1 off wine/beer and $2 off flatbreads\n- It's a short walk from Jtown and Social Study, so there are great options for more drinks/things to do afterwards\n- Not really great for large groups since it's fairly small. I'd say not to come with more than 6ish people\n- Other dishes that look amazing are the greens (it a huggggggeee  fluffy salad) and spicy mac n cheese (comes in a skillet, of course)\n\nFun fact: it's owned by the same group as Trestle, Stone's Throw, and Corridor, and it indeed has the same wow factor.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["I can see this as a great place to grab drinks with friends or even a date.

With absolutely no input we decided to order the chicken pot pie, pretzel with mustard and cheese sauce, the flatbread with roasted grapes and goat cheese. The food was alright and I would have to say I have honestly had a lot better elsewhere.\n\nChicken Pot Pie - The first bite I took was from the center and the soup was cold in the center. The puff pastry they had on top was soggy from the top to the bottom. In that first bite I got a chicken bone. The flavor was decent and the veggies were cooked well.\n\nFlatbread - The flatbread itself was very thin and cracker like. There were areas where it was nice and crispy but then there were other areas where it was really soggy and all of the toppings just fell off. The grapes were probably the best part about the dish. They were seasoned well and had some really great flavors.\n\nPretzel - The shape and presentation of the pretzel was really bad, but it was probably the best tasting dish we had. It went great with the whole mustard. The cheese sauce was really think and broken and did not have a great texture.\n\nWe also ordered a glass of wine and beer. Our wine had some pieces of cork in it. With how service was going that night we decided to just take out the pieces and drink our drinks. Every time the server came by, it always felt like an inconvenience to her and that she had better things to do, even though we were 2 out of 6 people there that night.\n\nTo be honest, I would avoid coming here.

The pretzel was excellent, with a chewy yet firm texture (and given that it was from Firebrand, I am not surprised that it was amazing).

You also have the option of exploring the neighboring stores and bars since you get a text letting you know when your table is ready.\nOnce seated, we ordered a few of the items that were recommended by other reviewers - the maple bacon butter, spicy sausage flatbread, and chicken pot pie.  I would say the flatbread was my favorite, it had a good combination of ingredients.  Unfortunately, the chicken pot pie had some flavor in there that tasted cherry-like which I didn't really appreciate that permeated the whole dish.  And the butter was interesting but it is served rock hard and they give it to you with cold bread, so it's not very easy to spread.

I love the subtle spice of the sausage, the thin crispyness of the crust (which was not at all greasy), and the arugula that paried so well along with the ricotta.

If anything I tasted no spice which was fine.  I loved how the top layer was crispy...and yes this dish was quite greacy...but hey its why I love mac n cheese!  Be careful though, it comes out SUPER hot!  This ooey-gooey cheesy dish was a fave!\n\n\nF.A.'S CHICKEN POT PIE - $12\nRoast chicken, carrots, sherry, tarragon \nI was quite impressed with this one mainly because it didn't look like a pie.  It looked like there was a thick flakey buttery thing of pastry on top and beneath the filling.  Otherwise the filling was out in the open so you see exactly what you're getting.  Just your standard chicken pot pie filling but what made it unique was the \"crust\".  Yum!\n\n3 SLIDERS - $10\nBeef, caramelized onions, bacon, Irish cheddar, aioli\nOh so tasty!  Simple but I appreciate it not being dry.  I love the little pickled peppers it came with...it compliments it SO well.  I felt the aioli tasted like ranch dressing..but its not a complaint.

The combination of atmosphere, cost, quality of food and drinks make it a no brainier five star that anyone venturing in the Fillmore area should try.\n\nThe highlight of Fat Angel for me is the food. It is a relatively small menu but everything on it is worth taking a shot at. The areas they excel in are the salads and the flat-breads. I had never encountered this combination of flavors before I came here and was shocked they could get such quality food to come out of that small kitchen. \n\nSeriously all four salads are delicious. My personal favorites being the kale salad and the endive salad. Also the portions on the salads are HUGE. They should be shared by two people and shouldn't even be attempted by one person. They aren't expensive and will fill you up. The Flat breads are even better. Every time I look at the menu I want to try something else but I always, always get the roasted red grape and walnut flat bread. It is just so savory and a perfect combination of sweet and salty. I rely on my date to order one of the others so I can at least try it but it is a halfhearted attempt at best. \n\nAnother positive is the service time. The turnaround on food is one of the best I have had in the city and the quality is always consistent. Shout out to whoever is back there whipping up the food.\n\nBy this time you are completely full and realize you haven't even gotten to the main dishes. I have had the sliders and the mac and cheese which are both great as well. The mac and cheese is very spicy so be forewarned if you aren't used to that. \n\nThis place also holds its own as a bar as well. There is a stuff drink menu with plenty of options for the beer aficionados. The wine is pretty varied as well but may not satisfy the wine heads of SF. \n\nThe customer service is great at Fat Angel as well. With easy pay at the bar and personally calling you when your table is ready are great perks. \n\nAlso full disclosure I am in love with the bartender/waitress.I don't know her name but she has short hair and tattoos and is the woman of my dreams.  I am sure she is married or taken but I am professing my love for her here. \n\nThe negatives that could knock off some stars for others are just how small Fat Angel is. It is a really tiny and intimate place and can get crowded on most nights by around 8 or 9pm. I am talking standing room only at the bar and freezing your butt off by choosing to sit at the outside tables because nothing is available inside. Be prepared for a wait time but its never too long. Also the small place leads to some really really close table set ups. You are in the other couples conversation no matter what so be prepared for people watching as you will be two inches from someone else. \n\nFat Angel may have an odd name but as one of my first introductions to social life in SF I couldn't have had a better experience. The service has not dipped in the three years I have been in SF and I would venture to say it won't when you make your way out there as well. \n\nFillmore has a gem that serves a perfect wine and candlelight home with food that leaves you coming back for more.

The mac-n-cheese was okay. It was served in a hot skillet which made scooping and serving the dish a bit difficult (there was no pan holder or hot glove to help in handling it). The Mister didn't take to the mac-n-cheese and said he could have made it himself. Although a fair assessment as far as difficulty of the dish, the Mister rarely cooks...yeah, go figure!

It was creamy, crispy , rich, warm, gooey, not too sweet, and subtly spicy in a way I can't describe, really. \n\nWhat an awesome place to hang out in the neighborhood.

It reminds me of the many small wine bars I visited in Madrid and the South of France. \n\nThe tables are a bit uneven, true.  Doesn't bother me enough to deduct a star though.\n\nI really appreciate the thought they put into their menu.

And what a serious bargain for city dining! \n\nEverything was in our favor last Thursday evening.. one of those odd nights where hubster and I must have had karma and/or the gods on our side.. rock star parking on Geary directly in front of the Fillmore? Check. The last available (corner) table for two at FA when we walked in? Check. Being seated, ordering, & eating within about 40 minutes and getting to the show just as the lights came down? Check!\n\nContrary to reviews, service was FAST. And our waiter was super friendly and sincere. Instead of trying to upsell us, he discouraged us from each ordering a salad as they are GIGANTIC and also said if we weren't super hungry, we could probably share the mac n' cheese vs. each getting our own. We opted to each get our own anyway as we weren't ordering any other apps., but he was totally right, we ended up both leaving with a to-go box of mac (which then became our next day lunches!).  \n\nAs far as the food goes, everything was ridiculously tasty. The horseradish dressing on our arugula salad was super yummy, but the fried capers put it over the top! And the mac n' cheese was some serious comfort food- perfectly cheesy with an amazing bread crumb toasty top, baked in its own mini casserole dish.. yum. We had to use some crazy will power to stop ourselves from leaving in a carb coma.\n\nFinally, the beer and wine is I think what people first & foremost come for; as they should. They have a terrific list not to mention some incredible and reasonable stuff on tap. Once again, our waiter actually suggested to me one of the least expensive wines on the menu, the $6 sauvignon blanc on tap (!) and had we had more time, I would have  loved to have shared a bottle. Super juicy and refreshing, easily one of the best wine deals in town. \n\nAs a side note, to be honest, the name Fat Angel was a bit of a turn-off. I thought it sounded a little cheesy, especially after ogling the gold chubby angel that greeted us, hanging prominently above the doorway. BUT, don't be fooled, inside the decor is actually quite nice. I especially dug the gaudy in a good way giant crystal chandeliers and what appeared to be extremely large golden organ pipes behind the bar. The soundtrack was a decent mix of indie rock that was just loud enough to help mask the super loud and slightly rowdy conversations going on around our table. \n\nAll in all, Fat Angel is definitely thee place to hang before a show at the Fillmore and if you happen to live nearby, this is sure to become a new favorite. You could easily split one of their $9 giant salads (which are presented at your table in a large wooden salad bowl) four ways with a group of friends. $2 for a quality salad? You heard right. \nYummy beers, wines, eats and treats too, we were especially tempted by the bread pudding a la mode we saw being brought to a couple next to us.. next time I'm hitting that up for sure!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-05-24"}, {"excerpts": ["some places have great drinks.

The only thing I really had a problem with... and this is just my preference, at the time I went they had a lack of any quality \"lighter\" beers. For their entire list/selection, even after I asked the bartender, there was only 1 lager that was very cheap compared to the others. I really enjoy Belgian beers, wheat beers, etc, and from a place that aims to have an extensive beer list I wanted more of my favorite beer \"genre\" to choose from! Although... checking their menu now I see a Belgian listed called \"Beer of the Future\".... I MUST RETURN FOR THAT. Further scrutiny shows that more such beers have appeared on their list, so I guess I can give them a whole-hearted 5 stars next time!\n\nOh yes, and did I mention they have MAPLE. BACON. BUTTER.??\n\nEDIT: They serve brunch now on Saturday (during the Farmer's Market in the Fillmore area) and have an unusual/different selection, although you could get \"normal\" items too (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc). I had a really tasty breakfast sandwich. My roomie got a pink mimosa (pricey but good) and the breakfast potatoes, which were seriously good and a pretty big portion for $4! My other friend got the \"Ploughman's Lunch\" which is a nice little salami/cheese/fruit plate that comes with a small beer (though he traded it out for OJ, ha).

We arrived at the restaurant around 7:30 and we're told there was one party in front of us as we put our name on the list. Note, we didn't actually write our name down or watch a host write our name down, we just gave our name to a waiter who was supposed to be responsible for the wait list. I never actually saw our name or any other guests name recorded in any way.\nAnyway, after putting our names on the \"list\" we grabbed a drink and stood near the entryway with a couple of beers. A few minutes later a couple came in and put their name on the list. Two seats opened up at the seat yourself bar so we sat down. Food menus were placed in front of us immediately, I told the waiter I would rather wait for an actual table, which he said was fine. A few minutes later I see the couple that came in after us being seated. I grabbed the waitress working that night and told her that we had come in first and asked why we weren't being seated. First the waitress tried to argue with me and insist that I must have just imagined to have stood next to them while they put their name on the list and that they probably came in earlier. When I insisted that no, we came in first, we were there when they put their names on the list the waitress rolled her eyes and told us that most people were fine sitting at the bar so the waiter handling the list had probably just taken us off. She then just walked away. I was shocked. She was just so rude. Instead of trying to rectify their mistake she acted like it was so ridiculous to expect the wait / host staff to do their job. I didn't catch her name, but the waitress working 5/19/2012 was probably the rudest waitstaff I have dealt with. I couldn't believe she just walked away, so I grabbed another waiter to try and get the situation resolved. The second waiter (named Sai I believe) apologized and offered to buy us a round of drinks out of his own pocket. Now, in retrospect he probably wouldn't have paid for the drinks out of his pocket the restaurant probably would (or at least should) have an allowance of food and / or drinks that can be comped when there is some sort of mistake on the part of the staff, but since he was saying it would be coming out of his pocket and since he was neither the very rude waitress I had just dealt with or the incompetent waiter who \"put our names on the list\" I refused the free drinks and just asked that we be seated at a table as soon as possible.\nA while later we were seated at this little window - bar thing.

The first experience was divine!  Great wine and champagne plus a delicious cheese with honeycomb (my favorite)!  i was sold and hooked.

I arrived before 5:30 on a Friday to snag my two tables.  When I arrived I spoke with the same guy who informed they had two reservations totaling 35 guests.  I am expecting an additional 20.  We tried to make it work at Fat Angel.  Then it became increasingly more difficult, so I took my party elsewhere.

It is a hidden (or not so hidden) gem of San Francisco. It is right off of Fillmore, it is a great spot if you are in the neighborhood. I've been going for about four years, and every time I go I find another great menu item. Mind you the menu is only one page (we aren't talking Cheesecake Factory selections) so hard to believe that I haven't tried it all. But on my last visit I discovered the Chicken Pot Pie. Divine! It may have been my first time trying it, but it certainly won't be my last. It is an open bowl of Chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and the perfect amount of gravy and spices with a nice layer of buttery, flakey crust on the bottom and backed to perfection on the top. Man, I want to go back today just to try it again. It is almost sweet (in a good way) so I do recommend sprinkling with salt and pepper. \n\nThey always have a kick bootie beer selection. And definitely keep them on the radar during sf beer week. Every evening they have a different delicious offering. I sampled five great Paradox beers and on another night 5 Bruery beers poured from bottles.

The most recent flavors were Bernaise, Chive, Chili, Maple Bacon and Molasses. You can try one for $5.50, three for $15 or all five for I think $25. That is a lot of butter, but I did feel compelled to try them all once and take home the left overs. This last time the Bernaise butter was my favorite. Delish.\n\nWe also love their flatbreads, toppings change seasonally. Most recently we tried the butternut squash and kale. Perfect!\n\nAnd the mac n cheese, is great. Has a tangy hardier taste with the perfect amount of sauce to crunch ratio.\n\nSometimes the prices can get a little steep if you don't pay attention when ordering, you think it may be a quick bite of food and a beer from your local gastropub, and next thing you know your tab is $90.

There's really not much I can add here that hasn't been said. Fat Angel came recommended to me by several different people. My roommate and I were just waiting for the right time to make our visit. We live in the area and were lucky to come in around 10 and get seated immediately at one of the tables in the corner. Contrary to some of the reviews here, I found everyone who worked there to be really laid back and friendly. One of the servers even stopped everyone during dinner to announce that two veterans of the establishment were recently engaged. The place is small enough that it's intimate but without seeming exclusive, which is probably why it manufactures so many regulars.\n\nAnd of course, the drinks. Definitely the most extensive collection of craft beers I've ever seen: the menu had about 8 pages of beer and wine, one page of food, and then another page of wine. I wanted to try a beer from the Bruery but wasn't willing to splurge quite yet and opted instead for one from Pretty Things. I also tried a cheese plate and the smoked trout salad based on the reviews here and wasn't disappointed. \n\nDespite the quantity and deliciousness of the food, this is still a bar at heart, so it makes for an interesting inversion of your typical dinner. Simply by the way the menu is set up, you find yourself ordering drinks with a side of food, and butter with a side of bread.

And what a serious bargain for city dining! \n\nEverything was in our favor last Thursday evening.. one of those odd nights where hubster and I must have had karma and/or the gods on our side.. rock star parking on Geary directly in front of the Fillmore? Check. The last available (corner) table for two at FA when we walked in? Check. Being seated, ordering, & eating within about 40 minutes and getting to the show just as the lights came down? Check!\n\nContrary to reviews, service was FAST. And our waiter was super friendly and sincere. Instead of trying to upsell us, he discouraged us from each ordering a salad as they are GIGANTIC and also said if we weren't super hungry, we could probably share the mac n' cheese vs. each getting our own. We opted to each get our own anyway as we weren't ordering any other apps., but he was totally right, we ended up both leaving with a to-go box of mac (which then became our next day lunches!).  \n\nAs far as the food goes, everything was ridiculously tasty. The horseradish dressing on our arugula salad was super yummy, but the fried capers put it over the top! And the mac n' cheese was some serious comfort food- perfectly cheesy with an amazing bread crumb toasty top, baked in its own mini casserole dish.. yum. We had to use some crazy will power to stop ourselves from leaving in a carb coma.\n\nFinally, the beer and wine is I think what people first & foremost come for; as they should. They have a terrific list not to mention some incredible and reasonable stuff on tap. Once again, our waiter actually suggested to me one of the least expensive wines on the menu, the $6 sauvignon blanc on tap (!) and had we had more time, I would have  loved to have shared a bottle. Super juicy and refreshing, easily one of the best wine deals in town. \n\nAs a side note, to be honest, the name Fat Angel was a bit of a turn-off. I thought it sounded a little cheesy, especially after ogling the gold chubby angel that greeted us, hanging prominently above the doorway. BUT, don't be fooled, inside the decor is actually quite nice. I especially dug the gaudy in a good way giant crystal chandeliers and what appeared to be extremely large golden organ pipes behind the bar. The soundtrack was a decent mix of indie rock that was just loud enough to help mask the super loud and slightly rowdy conversations going on around our table. \n\nAll in all, Fat Angel is definitely thee place to hang before a show at the Fillmore and if you happen to live nearby, this is sure to become a new favorite. You could easily split one of their $9 giant salads (which are presented at your table in a large wooden salad bowl) four ways with a group of friends. $2 for a quality salad? You heard right. \nYummy beers, wines, eats and treats too, we were especially tempted by the bread pudding a la mode we saw being brought to a couple next to us.. next time I'm hitting that up for sure!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-05-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Don't get me wrong, Pizza Inferno has good beers, but Fat Angel has amazing ones.

I didn't catch her name, but the waitress working 5/19/2012 was probably the rudest waitstaff I have dealt with. I couldn't believe she just walked away, so I grabbed another waiter to try and get the situation resolved. The second waiter (named Sai I believe) apologized and offered to buy us a round of drinks out of his own pocket. Now, in retrospect he probably wouldn't have paid for the drinks out of his pocket the restaurant probably would (or at least should) have an allowance of food and / or drinks that can be comped when there is some sort of mistake on the part of the staff, but since he was saying it would be coming out of his pocket and since he was neither the very rude waitress I had just dealt with or the incompetent waiter who \"put our names on the list\" I refused the free drinks and just asked that we be seated at a table as soon as possible.\nA while later we were seated at this little window - bar thing. I thought it  was odd we were being seated there since we refused seating at the bar and this was ostensibly the same or worse than seating at the bar, but at this point I was quite hungry so I just sat down. We ordered cheeses, meat, a salad, the mac & cheese, and a couple glasses of wine. The cheeses, meat, and wine were delivered quickly and were fine. The salad came out after we were finished with the cheeses and meat. The food was fine, not mind-blowing, but not bad. We were about two-thirds of the way through the salad when the check arrived. Both of us were sufficiently satiated so we didn't ask about the mac & cheese, but it was at this point that I decided I had to write a review addressing the subpar service at Fat Angel. The waiter who had offered to buy us a round came with a check that had taken the first round off the bill, which was nice but didn't really make up for all the issues with the meal. To me it seems like most of the waitstaff would fit better at a crappy dive bar, where you don't need to write things down because it really is much easier to remember a few drink orders than the names and order of people on a wait list or several tables food orders and you can be more surly with guests. \nIn short although the beer and wine list seems extensive & interesting the service will keep me away.", "rating": 1, "date": "2012-05-27"}, {"excerpts": ["There is also a few beers on tap that are decent.

I searched around on Yelp for places in the area so we could just park one time and walk over to the show afterwards. I found this place on here and saw the good reviews so we decided to try it out. We got here around 6 p.m. and sat up at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and nice! The place became very crowded as the evening went on, probably because of the show at the Fillmore. It was fun, classy and overall a stellar time! It was a place to go for food, wine, good beers and you can laugh in there without the whole place noticing even though it is a smaller place. We ordered the boar salami, truffle oil mushroom flatbread, a bleu cheese, maple bacon butter, lemon caper butter, bacon macaroni and cheese, sliders and chicken pot pie. This was more than enough food for four very hungry people!  All of the food was very good with the only disappointment being the chicken pot pie. The pot pie was only luke warm and very bland. Next time I would opt for a salad because they were huge and looked amazing. It seemed like the kitchen was a bit disorganized if they were busy but I am sure that will be worked out in time, they are fairly new. As for the drinks we ordered the Pinot Nior on tap, Pranqster beer, a specialty bottle beer and a glass of each of the two Pinots. The 2006 Carneros Pinot was out of this world, highly recommend it. The highlights definitely were that Pinot, maple bacon butter, macaroni and cheese and the truffle oil flatbread. I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and experience and will go back soon, even when I am not going to see a show at the Fillmore.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-04-13"}]}
