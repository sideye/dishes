Some personal faves that you need to try: 1) SUNSET BOULEVARD SALAD: baby spinach, cucumber, watermelon, feta cheese w/ raspberry vinaigrette...they used to have mint leaves & pine nuts but took them out!

Why? Okay, I'll elaborate.\n\nFrom the outside this place really doesn't look much different than your typical, space-restricted SF cafe except for one thing; a sign that says it has $2 pints everyday.  That's right, $2 pints of beer on draft.  For a place in SF it would probably be acceptable even if it was $2 for some domestic trash beer, but it isn't.   It was like a tractor beam that pulled me in.  \n\nThe $2 beers (at the time) were a choice of  SF's own, Speakeasy Brewing's Big Daddy IPA, Prohibition Ale and Tallulah Extra Pale Ale.  Sure, they might not get an average rating of 4 or higher on BeerAdvocate but at $2 for a pint of craft beer...in SF...on a Saturday, are your really going to argue? I didn't think so.\n\nSo aside from the $2 beers and some pretty cheap bottled offerings, they also make sandwiches, pastries, coffee and other breakfast options here for affordable prices to really round out their function as a cafe.  However, based upon what you've read already, you know what I was here for.  I had to grab a cold one before trekking up to the top of Lombard Street.\n\nThere's still ample seating bot inside and out despite the size of the cafe, which in reality, is pretty decent in size. It isn't the most modern, upscale cafe you'll probably visit in the SF area but the fact of the matter is that it serves it purpose quite well.  Beer, food, wifi, you really can't go wrong here.\n\nIf I found myself walking around SF on any given day and I wanted to grab a few cold beers without breaking the bank, this place can easily be my regular spot.

While it gets its fair share of tourists, no one can deny its close-knit neighborhood feel.  A real breath of fresh air from those tourist traps down the street!\n\nMy ideal solo lunch break includes a good book, a seat at the high counter along the far wall, and one of 901's incredible sandwiches or salads (or maybe some waffles one of these days).  The dining area is so cozy, and the music is great too.\n\nTheir salads and sandwiches are really, REALLY good.  Some personal faves that you need to try: 1) SUNSET BOULEVARD SALAD: baby spinach, cucumber, watermelon, feta cheese w/ raspberry vinaigrette...they used to have mint leaves & pine nuts but took them out!  If at all possible, please please please bring 'em back. 2) ANGEL ISLAND SALAD: baby spinach, pineapple, feta cheese, w/ dijon dressing...again, took out the pine nuts but still a good bet. 3) SEACLIFF SALAD: romaine, red onion, toasted pecans, sprouts, tuna salad, parmesan, w/ olive oil, balsamic vinegar & lemon...was a staple for me while on the South Beach diet. 4) DIMAGGIO WRAP: hummus, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, falafel, yogurt dressing, and hot sauce...in a panini-pressed wrap.  I love this thing, it's incredible.\n\nThe only thing that occasionally irks me is the service: it's soo o o o SLO OOO O W.  I've watched potential customers walk out because no one's at the counter to take their orders, and a couple of times the staff straight up forgot to place orders.  I try not to let it get to me and I wouldn't have a problem with it, but my lunch break is only an hour long.  I still recommend this place to co-workers and friends, and I still support this cafe because it's simply a great place with a cool vibe.

Actually, it's called 901 Columbus Caffe (two \"ff\"s), not to be confused with one of my favorite bars in North Beach, Columbus Cafe.  Food including soup, salad, and sandwiches; and drinks like caffeinated drinks and $1.50 draft beers!  There's also some really good looking desserts like home-made tiramisu, various cheesecakes, biscotti, and other sweet treats!  Big, flat screen television showing sports and lots of board games to play with -- my boyfriend, Ian and I played a great game of Scrabble the last time we were here.  It was so much fun.  \n\nGreat casual atmosphere, lots of people on their laptops taking advantage of the free wi-fi.  Outside seating also available during those hot San Francisco nights -- great for people watching (tourist and locals walking by or on the cable car, and looking at the Bikram students keepin' it hot doing yoga across the street).  \n\nWill keep comin' back for more... more beer, off course.

"], "author": "turtle power e.", "review": "To the owner of this establishment,  I think you've accomplished cafe perfection! To start, everything one can consume here is perfect! I've tried just about everything. Let's see...there's the excellent espresso to compliment a delectable cookie or homemade tiramisu. There's the deliciously healthy wraps and sandwiches (Sinatra for veggie-lovers, or the WiseGuy for the carnivores). The salads are just as scrumptious, the soups are delicious. The waffles are heavenly (with bananas and pecans...or OR strawberries and nutella...oh dear).  \n\nThen there are the beverage offerings! A perfect cafe must have excellent coffee and espresso which is exactly what you will find here. My first drink here was a zebra mocha which is a cafe favorite but lately, just having the solo espresso is satisfying as it is wonderfully rich and aromatic. Oh, and then, here's the best part...ahem... $2 drafts/$3 wines from 5pm?!? Seriously, you can't find a deal like that in any kind of cool neighborhood. Not only that, but the draft pale ale and house red wine is really really nice. \n\nThe perfect cafe must also have the perfect ambience. This spot is cozy, comfortable, and unpretentious with nice music and lighting and even outdoor seating if that's your thing.  To complete the package, there's free wifi, computers and a printer if you don't have your own, an array of books and board games, and ultra-friendly staff to serve you. You can even zone out and watch the tube. And if you don't want to do any of that, the location is great for people-watching. Grab a seat outside and watch tourists, locals, and cable cars pass you by.\nI've been to plenty of cafes in my time and this has remained my favorite the last couple years. In fact, I think I will head there now...all this time reviewing has got me craving an espresso. \n\nHere's to 5-star cafe perfection!
