We (boyfriend and I) decided to go here based off of yelp reviews to see why some people rated it poorly and some outstandingly. Unfortunately, I am going to side with those who give it 1 star or 0, if possible.\n\nWe  walked in on a Wednesday night, made reservations, as very few people were there at about 6:30pm. We weren't greeted by our server and felt a bit rushed as he stood there waiting for us to order, after requesting a few minutes. The extra time was necessary, considering their menu was so long. We ordered the Calamari Fritti, to start us off, which is basically calamari with marinara. It was okay, only the top parts of the squid cut in ring-like shapes, no tentacles. From the impression of our appetizer, we thought it would've been an okay dinner.\n\nWe finally ordered and got our food with not too long of a wait. He ordered Spaghetti alle Vongole (white wine sauce, clams and garlic) as I had the  Rigatoni Osilio (chicken basil in pesto sauce). The Spaghetti alle Vongole was a bland white wine sauce, lacked garlic and any sort of flavor with clams thrown in. As my Rigatoni Osilio, was an extremely small portion, where they used large rigatoni pasta that was dry, topped with clumps of pesto. People are usually put in a situation where they want less olive oil, but in this case, I wanted more. The bread provided tasted stale and we wondered, what more could go wrong from this place. As we already started eating our dishes, the server then comes back asking if we wanted parmesan cheese. We both agreed that it would probably add a little something to our dishes. He spooned a large amount and started to put it on my dish. When I told him that, that was enough, he plopped the entire spoonful in my plate, no longer being able to see my rigatoni noodles because there was that little of it. The boyfriend's clams ate all the cheese, as the server plopped it off to the side.\n\nHe was also very rude, was never attentive of what we wanted and was into chatting it up with his fellow servers. If you're a tourist and you want a true North Beach experience, don't come here to be disappointed and be given the wrong impression.

I was worried because it looked small and we were going to have seven people. When a gentleman from the restaurant approached me outside one day, I asked if that was OK and if we could make a reservation. He said it would not be a problem, and gave me his business card. The next day I called and made the reservation. I ended up having to change it to eight people, and they were still able to accommodate us. \n\nThe pace of the meal was great; the service was adequate but not above and beyond; but the food? Absolutely amazing! I have been home for a few days and I'm still thinking about it! I will definitely go back next time I visit San Francisco. \n\nHere's a list of some things my party ordered, and I will also post pics:\n\nAppetizers:\nCalamari Fritti - 13.95\nTomatoes Caprese - 12.95\n\nDinners:\nTortellini al Gongorzola - 13.95 - My vegetarian friend ordered this, although there are lots of vegetarian options. I went with the gnocchi but this one tasted great too! Everyone wanted to taste everything so there was a lot of sharing taking place. \nGnocchi Ruggero - 16.95 - I had this. It was gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese sauce, walnuts and spinach -- HEAVEN! \nGnocchi Fondenti - 14.95 - Baked four cheese-cream sauce with nutmeg. For some reason the baked dish seemed to come in a smaller portion. My friend had asked about sharing this with her husband, and the waiter rightly recommended against it. However, my portion for the Ruggero was definitely enough to have been shared. \nRavioli Aragosta - 16.95 - Lobster in tomato cream sauce. Two in my party ordered this and I had a couple bites. It was also fantastic. \n\nWe skipped dessert because we were off to Ghirardelli for ice cream, which I'll probably Yelp next. Definitely try the gnocchi or ravioli if you go -- Mona Lisa does it right!\n\nWhy not five stars? The place only has beer and wine, and for beer Peroni hardly counts. Sorry. I did have an Anchor Steam, though. Can't go wrong with that. I did wish they had some fancy pre-dinner mixed drinks or martinis, though. Also, the waiter said it would be a $3 refill for sodas. I don't know if we were not charged after all because my party really wasn't happy with that and they might've overheard, but yeah, that's just kind of ridiculous if that rule is actually enforced.  Lucky for us, it wasn't. \n\nTo address some other minor complaints from fellow Yelpers, I found the decor cheesy yet entertaining. It made the place fun. As for the space issue it's San Francisco. Every restaurant I've been to there has tables close together you just sort of have to deal; at least they took our reservation and hooked us up with a nice long table in the back.\n\nThe Verdict: Just thinking about that gnocchi makes my mouth water.

I ate here with my younger brother and felt that our waiter prioritized certain tables over ours. Haven been a waiter, I understand different signs customers give me in order to accommodate their wants and needs. That being said, we closed our menus since we already decided on what to get. Our waiter passed us several times and clearly saw that we were ready, but still insisted on not acknowledging us. Finally, he took our orders. Losing my appetite already, but hey, hopefully the food compensates for his lack of friendly service.\n\n- Food comes out and it looks semi-pleasing. My \"Spaghetti Polpette \" lacked sauce. The spaghetti itself was not cooked al dente as requested. My brother's pasta, \"Spaghetti allo Scoglio\" was appetizing, I give them that. \n\n- I took a couple bites and was not pleased, so I was waiting for my waiter to check up on us. He went to our table and asked us how the food was (kind gesture) but as I was speaking, he walks away to attend to another table, that did not even flag him down. Such a rude move. He comes back after attending to the table next to mine, and says, \" you wanted more sauce?\" \"Yes, please\".\n\n- I was presented with more sauce in a timely manner. Sauce wasn't flavorful, but I really didn't want to be that \"one guy\" so decided to let it go. Did not end up packing our leftovers (which I usually do). \n\nIt could have been an off day for them. Our waiter could have been having a bad day. But regardless of the fact, servitude, friendliness, and tastiness is always key, and Mona Lisa did not reach my expectations. Would I give this place another try? Yeah, I would, but would definitely try something else and request another server.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-08-03"}, {"excerpts": ["The \"side\" of meatballs was actually from the Spaghetti Polpette (without the spaghetti)- ", "so I was charged for a half order of spaghetti polpette... not a huge deal.

As my title stated I generalized the cuisine as southern cuisine. When I have been starting my North Beach adventure I would go to Italian restaurants trying to find specialized, regional cuisines. One of the major problems of trying to categorize the regional cuisine of the restaurant is the extensive menu. There are so many items on the list I was worried about the quality of each dish. In addition I couldn't what in the menu what the regional cuisine of this restaurant; the only reason I stated southern cuisine of this restaurant was because it stated on the Yelp information. Having quick lunch I needed to just one item, but I wasn't sure what item to ordered. It was either Fettuccine Mona Lisa or a risotto dish. I asked the waiter his recommendation about the risotto. He asked if I liked meat or seafood. I was thinking about the seafood. He went down the list to pick certain items. In the end I decided to order the Fettuccine Mona Lisa for one reason. In the past if a certain restaurant names a dish after its own restaurant name I'm assuming the dish is its specialty. That's why I ordered the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. \n\nAs mentioned before one of the reasons why this menu was confusing was because I couldn't tell what is their specialty. There are several items named after the restaurant (Fettuccine Mona Lisa, Chicken Mona Lisa, Pizza Mona Lisa, and Veal Mona Lisa). There are also dishes named after the City (Spaghetti San Francisco, Chicken San Francisco, and Risotto San Francisco). Since this restaurant is on North Beach why doesn't the restaurant name some of the dishes after North Beach? Lol.\n\nNow back to my only dish, which is the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. Two great things about this pasta is that the pasta is cooked al denta and the sauce is creamy but not heavy. One thing I didn't like about this pasta is it was quite salty due to the olives. Since the olives are cured having the olives with the ham makes dish quite salty. I would recommend either having the olives or ham alone in the pasta but not both. With abundance of items on the menu I feared that this dish would not maintain its quality. Other than the olives the pasta was quite tasty. \n\nEven though I only had the Fettuccine Mona Lisa today, I've eaten here before. The last time I ate here was about 10 years ago. I don't think the menu has remained the same but what I remembered was that the menu was very extensive that made it intimidating. What I ordered last time was the salmon, but there were so many different dishes of salmon I couldn't remember what I ordered. However I do remember the salmon was dry and overcooked. The fear of having too many items is some of the dishes won't be as good. Even though I've only eaten here twice in the last ten years my rating is based upon two items - a tasty Fettuccine Mona Lisa and a dry salmon. In a sense my rating is based on one word - consistency. With too many dishes consistency is hard to achieve.

Luca immediately arrogantly stated that since there are four of us dining, we would have to order four dishes.\n\nWhat?! This was nowhere stated on the menu, and I saw other diners at the restaurant clearly sharing dishes. I thought he was joking at first and tried to laugh it off, but he retorted that he was being serious and demanded us to order another dish. I asked for some time to think about what we wanted to order. I was shocked that there was an obligation to order one dish per person for our table, when clearly it wasn't a requirement for others. I realized a few minutes later that he was probably taking advantage of us, thinking that we are tourists, since we were there as a family? I flagged him down and asked him to cancel our order and we will take our business elsewhere, and suddenly he seemed okay with serving us. This was absolutely not the ambiance I wanted to bring my family to, and was so upset at the upfront rude behavior of Luca that it ruined the rest of my night. \n\n3. The food itself was hit or miss.

He ordered Spaghetti alle Vongole (white wine sauce, clams and garlic) as I had the  Rigatoni Osilio (chicken basil in pesto sauce).

As my Rigatoni Osilio, was an extremely small portion, where they used large rigatoni pasta that was dry, topped with clumps of pesto.

"], "author": "Gerald R.", "review": "NORTH BEACH EATING PART VIII: SOUTHERN CUISINE - COLUMBUS DAY\n\nI ate here at lunch today on Columbus Day. As my title stated I generalized the cuisine as southern cuisine. When I have been starting my North Beach adventure I would go to Italian restaurants trying to find specialized, regional cuisines. One of the major problems of trying to categorize the regional cuisine of the restaurant is the extensive menu. There are so many items on the list I was worried about the quality of each dish. In addition I couldn't what in the menu what the regional cuisine of this restaurant; the only reason I stated southern cuisine of this restaurant was because it stated on the Yelp information. Having quick lunch I needed to just one item, but I wasn't sure what item to ordered. It was either Fettuccine Mona Lisa or a risotto dish. I asked the waiter his recommendation about the risotto. He asked if I liked meat or seafood. I was thinking about the seafood. He went down the list to pick certain items. In the end I decided to order the Fettuccine Mona Lisa for one reason. In the past if a certain restaurant names a dish after its own restaurant name I'm assuming the dish is its specialty. That's why I ordered the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. \n\nAs mentioned before one of the reasons why this menu was confusing was because I couldn't tell what is their specialty. There are several items named after the restaurant (Fettuccine Mona Lisa, Chicken Mona Lisa, Pizza Mona Lisa, and Veal Mona Lisa). There are also dishes named after the City (Spaghetti San Francisco, Chicken San Francisco, and Risotto San Francisco). Since this restaurant is on North Beach why doesn't the restaurant name some of the dishes after North Beach? Lol.\n\nNow back to my only dish, which is the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. Two great things about this pasta is that the pasta is cooked al denta and the sauce is creamy but not heavy. One thing I didn't like about this pasta is it was quite salty due to the olives. Since the olives are cured having the olives with the ham makes dish quite salty. I would recommend either having the olives or ham alone in the pasta but not both. With abundance of items on the menu I feared that this dish would not maintain its quality. Other than the olives the pasta was quite tasty. \n\nEven though I only had the Fettuccine Mona Lisa today, I've eaten here before. The last time I ate here was about 10 years ago. I don't think the menu has remained the same but what I remembered was that the menu was very extensive that made it intimidating. What I ordered last time was the salmon, but there were so many different dishes of salmon I couldn't remember what I ordered. However I do remember the salmon was dry and overcooked. The fear of having too many items is some of the dishes won't be as good. Even though I've only eaten here twice in the last ten years my rating is based upon two items - a tasty Fettuccine Mona Lisa and a dry salmon. In a sense my rating is based on one word - consistency. With too many dishes consistency is hard to achieve. I feel if the restaurant cuts more than half of the dishes in the current menu I believe the quality of the food will be much better and consistency will be better achieved.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-10-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Chicken San Francisco: ", "Chicken drenched in salt topped with canned artichoke hearts.

My Cousin and I came here for dinner after a long day of shopping in Chinatown because she had been here before with my Aunt.  The traditional Italian dinner we had (3 hours) was something amazing!   The owner treated us like his closest friends or even family, and mad us feel very at home.  He spoke to my Aunt on the phone and they had a very nice conversation in Italian, after which we were served a wonderful 3 tiered tray of antipasto, complete with calamari, brochetta, prosciutto with melon, fresh wonderful parmigiano regiano, fresh basil and arugula, and a marvelous dipping sauce for the calamari....and that was just for starters. The owner brought us a wonderful bottle of Chianti Classico,which was delicious, and then the main courses.  My Cousin had the Bistecca with fresh porcini mushrooms cooked medium rare, and I had the Vitello Mona Lisa (Veal Mona Lisa), and they were both absolutely wonderful. We finished off the meal with wonderful Lemonciello for desert.  We had to get home unfortunately, but had we not, we would have been happy to stay there and close it down:)  The owner Maurizio took several photographs with us in front of his beautiful Fiat that sits in front of his restaurant that has a picture of the Mona Lisa air-brushed on the hood of his car.  What an amazing ending to a wonderful day.

It was also fantastic. \n\nWe skipped dessert because we were off to Ghirardelli for ice cream, which I'll probably Yelp next. Definitely try the gnocchi or ravioli if you go -- Mona Lisa does it right!\n\nWhy not five stars? The place only has beer and wine, and for beer Peroni hardly counts. Sorry. I did have an Anchor Steam, though. Can't go wrong with that. I did wish they had some fancy pre-dinner mixed drinks or martinis, though. Also, the waiter said it would be a $3 refill for sodas. I don't know if we were not charged after all because my party really wasn't happy with that and they might've overheard, but yeah, that's just kind of ridiculous if that rule is actually enforced.

", "Since this restaurant is on North Beach why ", "doesn't the restaurant name some of the dishes after North Beach? "], "author": "Gerald R.", "review": "NORTH BEACH EATING PART VIII: SOUTHERN CUISINE - COLUMBUS DAY\n\nI ate here at lunch today on Columbus Day. As my title stated I generalized the cuisine as southern cuisine. When I have been starting my North Beach adventure I would go to Italian restaurants trying to find specialized, regional cuisines. One of the major problems of trying to categorize the regional cuisine of the restaurant is the extensive menu. There are so many items on the list I was worried about the quality of each dish. In addition I couldn't what in the menu what the regional cuisine of this restaurant; the only reason I stated southern cuisine of this restaurant was because it stated on the Yelp information. Having quick lunch I needed to just one item, but I wasn't sure what item to ordered. It was either Fettuccine Mona Lisa or a risotto dish. I asked the waiter his recommendation about the risotto. He asked if I liked meat or seafood. I was thinking about the seafood. He went down the list to pick certain items. In the end I decided to order the Fettuccine Mona Lisa for one reason. In the past if a certain restaurant names a dish after its own restaurant name I'm assuming the dish is its specialty. That's why I ordered the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. \n\nAs mentioned before one of the reasons why this menu was confusing was because I couldn't tell what is their specialty. There are several items named after the restaurant (Fettuccine Mona Lisa, Chicken Mona Lisa, Pizza Mona Lisa, and Veal Mona Lisa). There are also dishes named after the City (Spaghetti San Francisco, Chicken San Francisco, and Risotto San Francisco). Since this restaurant is on North Beach why doesn't the restaurant name some of the dishes after North Beach? Lol.\n\nNow back to my only dish, which is the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. Two great things about this pasta is that the pasta is cooked al denta and the sauce is creamy but not heavy. One thing I didn't like about this pasta is it was quite salty due to the olives. Since the olives are cured having the olives with the ham makes dish quite salty. I would recommend either having the olives or ham alone in the pasta but not both. With abundance of items on the menu I feared that this dish would not maintain its quality. Other than the olives the pasta was quite tasty. \n\nEven though I only had the Fettuccine Mona Lisa today, I've eaten here before. The last time I ate here was about 10 years ago. I don't think the menu has remained the same but what I remembered was that the menu was very extensive that made it intimidating. What I ordered last time was the salmon, but there were so many different dishes of salmon I couldn't remember what I ordered. However I do remember the salmon was dry and overcooked. The fear of having too many items is some of the dishes won't be as good. Even though I've only eaten here twice in the last ten years my rating is based upon two items - a tasty Fettuccine Mona Lisa and a dry salmon. In a sense my rating is based on one word - consistency. With too many dishes consistency is hard to achieve. I feel if the restaurant cuts more than half of the dishes in the current menu I believe the quality of the food will be much better and consistency will be better achieved.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-10-13"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the risotto San Francisco.

Bread and water was quickly brought. Dinner napkins were placed in our laps. \n\nStarted with their Italian sampler. It had bruschetta, tomatoes caprese and roasted garlic. Everything was done fine, with fresh ingredients. We also had the fried calamari which was ok. Nicely fried although not much flavor, but it was ok. Soon afterward the manager/host decided to send a complimentary appetizer tray our way. Whatever the reasons - whether just being nice or it was a kitchen mistake that he wanted to give to us, I really appreciated the gesture, and it earned some major brownie points with me. The appetizer plate had some more bruschetta, some olives, some parm-reg cheese, and some prosciutto.
