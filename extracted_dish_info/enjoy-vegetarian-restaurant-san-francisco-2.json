No complaints about the service - staff were friendly and efficient enough.\n\nWe decided to share a couple dishes and a small soup between the two of us. I ordered the Basil Soy Chicken with Mixed Green Vegetables ($12.99). I absolutely loved this dish! It tasted exactly like the popular Taiwanese dish \"3-cup chicken\". The soy meat had an amazing texture and flavor - it was definitely one of the best fake meats I've ever tried! My non-veg friend couldn't believe that the \"meat\" was made of soy; she said it tasted exactly like chicken. My friend ordered the House Special Fried Rice ($10.99), which came with veggie BBQ pork, veggie ham, peas and carrots. The fried rice was delicious, and the veggie meat was also very good. Lastly, my friend ordered the small Thai Style Soup ($7.50), which came with a nice mix of tofu, broccoli, pineapple, and bean sprouts. The soup was a bit too sour and spicy for my taste, but my friend really enjoyed it.\n\nThe two minor complaints I have are location and price. It took us a good 15-20 minutes to find parking and another 15 minutes to walk to the restaurant. Also, prices were a bit higher than I expected, considering it's in Chinatown.

I probably wouldn't even be able to tell that it was faux meat if I didn't know better. The broccoli that came with the dish was a little bland, but still fine as long as you put some of the sauce on it from the spareribs. \n\nThe beef string beans were really good as well. The beef was very flavorful and tasted just like real beef - this dish was my coworker's favorite. \n\nThe Ma Po tofu had some mushrooms bits and some peas in it and was very flavorful. It also was not too spicy so it was good for me since I can't handle too spicy. Also goes really well with rice! \n\nOverall, it was a great experience eating at a vegetarian restaurant for my first time. Pretty cool how their faux meat tastes just as good as real meat.

Over one weekend, I watched way too many PETA videos and I started feeling guilty about eating meat.  During the two months that I was vegetarian, I frequented Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant.  As a person who has had her fair share of meat, and reveled in her carnivorous ways, I was really impressed that this restaurant was able to fool my tastebuds. My favorites are: Lemon Sauce Fried \"Chicken\", Sweet and Sour \"Chicken\", House Special Fried Rice, Eggplant in Spicy Chili Sauce.  You can't go wrong with those dishes.  I know they labeled the eggplant dish as \"spicy\" but it was not spicy at all.  The eggplant is so creamy and this is absolutely my favorite out of all the dishes I mentioned.\n\nI wasn't too big of a fan of the braised spareribs with daikon. The faux meat was a bit chewy for me and there was a type of spice that I can't pinpoint that I didn't like too much.  It kind of tastes like cinnamon, but it's quite not the same.  I just felt the spice they used made the sauce taste funny.  The Singapore style rice noodles tasted great but it was kind of dry.  \n\nSadly, I am not a vegetarian anymore.  My body didn't like being deprived of meat (my hair started shedding more and I would rather eat a chicken than walk around San Francisco looking like Homer Simpson). I would definitely come back here, especially on days when I'm avoiding meat.

The food here is good, but I think the \"original\" one is better and more flavorful. \n\nThe decor at this location is definitely better than the location on Kirkham. Enjoy Vegetarian on Kearny Street is more spacious and has (I believe) three round tables that's in another room.  It's also clean inside.\n\nI came here with my two managers who treated me to lunch. When we got there, I told the waitress I made reservations and she seated us right away. Not too long after, she brought a pot of tea and gave us a few minutes to decide on our order. \n\nThey have a lunch special where you can choose from about 20 different selections and it comes with a bowl of soup, 1 egg roll, and a bowl of white or brown rice for only $7.50. I'd say that's a deal compared to eating in the FiDi where everything is at least $10. \n\nTo start off, we ordered the samosa which comes in 5 pieces.

I had eaten at the Kirkham Street location and liked the foods I tried, but I had no idea the Kearny Street location served the exact same menu.  This location is much more modern than the Kirkham Street address.\n\nThis was a rather early 5:30 PM dinner for me so I didn't order as much food as I might normally do since I had eaten lunch just a few hours prior to visiting here.  I started with the Fried Spring Rolls which was also recommended by Adrienne.  I only ordered one main entr\u00e9e selecting the Bean Curd Rolls w/ vegetable and a bowl of steamed brown rice.  In addition to the complimentary hot tea I ordered an iced peach green tea.\n\nUnlike the Kirkham Street location a meal here begins with a complimentary dish of pickled greens.  I thought the greens had a nice crunch and a good, tart pickle flavor but these were a bit tough to chew.  The iced peach green tea I ordered had very good peach flavor but it also seemed overly sweetened.  I would have preferred more green tea flavor instead of the syrup flavor I tasted.\n\nThe kitchen works quite quickly and soon I was brought the Fried Spring Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XKj8_4QdoBMeYcg6OoespA?select=xWk0I0S9KWMB06wKUEDYxg).  Fried up golden brown the crispy, thin wrapper was stuffed with a hot (in temperature) cabbage, carrot and bean thread filling that almost seemed creamy.  These were very good spring rolls with or without the sweet and sour dipping sauce which accompanied it.\n\nThe Bean Curd Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XKj8_4QdoBMeYcg6OoespA?select=vVS_mxjcKdhopgpADsaInQ) looked fabulous.  These were served over steamed spears of perfectly cooked Shanghai bok choy in a tasty sauce accented by strands of Chinese black moss.  The Bean Curd Rolls are chewy soybean sheet layers stuffed with napa cabbage, mushrooms, strips of sweet soybean sheet, carrots and other fungi.  The taste was excellent and paired quite well with the nuttiness of the brown rice.  So good, in fact, that I ate everything that was brought to me.\n\nA complimentary dessert of fresh orange wedges and sweet, dark burgundy bing cherries arrived with the check.
