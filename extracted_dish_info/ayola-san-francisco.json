I found it kind of bland. You definitely need to add hummus and hot sauce to it. The falafel was all right as well. Crispy on the outside, but I found this bland too. And it was a little too dense for me. I gave my coworker one and he seemed to like it though. The tzatziki was the most disappointing. It didn't have that tart flavor I love. It was more reminiscent of a creamy mayo, which I found it a little odd.\n\nOverall, Ayola was okay.

I've gotten delivery from Ayola several times through DoorDash and usually bounce back and forth between either the chicken shawarma or a combo platter. \n\nRecommend: \nCHICKEN SHAWARMA is offered in either 7\" or 9\". I always get the 7\" but I also spring for the fries + soda combo. The fries are crispy outside and soft on the inside. I usually can't finish the whole meal because of the fries so I would save half of the shawarma for a late afternoon snack. Yay! Be forewarned that it gets messy eating this since they don't skimp on the chicken so have a fork or fingers ready to pick up the aftermath of your chicken falling off your shawarma. \n\nCOMBO PLATTER is a great way to get a bunch of sides as samplers.

Crispy outside and flavorful inside. I like to dip it in the tzatziki sauce.\n-Baba ganoush: Slightly smoky flavor. Good to eat on its own.\n-Dolmas: I like the inside filling but the outside had a tad too much lemon juice. \n-Eggplant salad: Alright. Only enjoyed the eggplant. \n-Hummus: Average. But to be fair, I was full from the rest of the combo platter.  \n-Tabouleh salad: Tasted rather plain to me but if you love parsley, then it's your salad.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Anyways, I opted for the 4-Item Combo Platter with pita for $10.75. \n"], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "Ayola adds a little variety to the neighborhood with Mediterranean dishes - falafel, Greek salads, hummus, tzatziki, and so on. This little Greek spot is essentially the size of a takeout counter. There are only a few seats by the window, but there are public parklets nearby for you to enjoy your lunch. \n\nI usually order a gyro or a shawarma. I'm still not quite clear what is the difference between the two. Hopefully someone will clearly explain it to me one day, but everyone seems to have a slightly different explanation of each. \n\nGyros & Shawarmas are about $8 for 7 inches, and $9 for 9 inches. It is a marginal difference, but the extra dollar is worth the extra 2 inches. I typically order the 7 inch. I once ordered the 9 inch, hoping to eat half and save the rest for later, but ended up devouring the entire sandwich.\nThe shaved gyro meat of lamb & beef are tasty and have good flavor. I couldn't tell the difference between lamb & beef, but I took that as a good sign, since I couldn't detect any gamey taste. \nThe chicken gyro is quite good too. The chicken shawarma, as far as I can tell, is made with roasted chicken instead. The lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, & red onions taste very fresh and crisp. I usually request it without red onions, but sometimes they forget to take them out. Their tzatziki is creamy, yet refreshing. I've tried to make my own tzatziki and it was okay, but of course, not as good as theirs. The best part is the warm, soft, thick pita bread. \n\nTheir fries are delicious as well. I'm not even a big fan of fries, but I can appreciate that they're served hot and seasoned well. They're more of a thick cut with a slightly mushy center. \nThey even have containers of sauces right on the counter, so you can help yourself without having to pump your own sauce. \n\nThe office ordered catering for a meeting once, so I decided to take the opportunity to try all the things I was curious to try. (Speaking of boring meetings, does it bother anyone else to see people show up to take their order & give a rushed, 'Sorry so busy, I can't stay.' Right, yet not too busy for free food.) \nAnyways, I opted for the 4-Item Combo Platter with pita for $10.75. \nI chose Dolmas, Tzatziki, Hummus & Baklava, and added Gyro Meat for $3. \nI slathered some tart hummus on the pita bread. Not bad. \nThen I dunked the pita into the tzatziki and sandwiched it with some gyro meat. Pretty good.\nThe dolmas were too tart for me. I've always been curious to try stuffed grape leaves. I wasn't quite sure what they were filled with, but I was expecting them to be more salty than sour. \nSurprisingly it was more food than I could finish, so I ate the leftovers for a snack later that day.\n\nI was most looking forward to trying the baklava. The sweet layers of crunchy pastry & sweet, crushed walnut filling with some pistachio dust on top was so good. I actually took it home to share with Mr. Joy, who has a slight walnut allergy, but he didn't have a reaction to it. For an extra $2, this is a pretty good way to satisfy a sweet tooth. \n\nThere is usually a line around lunchtime, but there are lines everywhere at noon. Their line actually appears long because they have limited space, so it's not unusual to see people lining out the door, but the service is actually pretty quick.

I'm still not quite clear what is the difference between the two. Hopefully someone will clearly explain it to me one day, but everyone seems to have a slightly different explanation of each. \n\nGyros & Shawarmas are about $8 for 7 inches, and $9 for 9 inches. It is a marginal difference, but the extra dollar is worth the extra 2 inches. I typically order the 7 inch. I once ordered the 9 inch, hoping to eat half and save the rest for later, but ended up devouring the entire sandwich.\nThe shaved gyro meat of lamb & beef are tasty and have good flavor. I couldn't tell the difference between lamb & beef, but I took that as a good sign, since I couldn't detect any gamey taste. \nThe chicken gyro is quite good too. The chicken shawarma, as far as I can tell, is made with roasted chicken instead. The lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, & red onions taste very fresh and crisp. I usually request it without red onions, but sometimes they forget to take them out. Their tzatziki is creamy, yet refreshing. I've tried to make my own tzatziki and it was okay, but of course, not as good as theirs. The best part is the warm, soft, thick pita bread. \n\nTheir fries are delicious as well. I'm not even a big fan of fries, but I can appreciate that they're served hot and seasoned well. They're more of a thick cut with a slightly mushy center. \nThey even have containers of sauces right on the counter, so you can help yourself without having to pump your own sauce. \n\nThe office ordered catering for a meeting once, so I decided to take the opportunity to try all the things I was curious to try.

The sweet layers of crunchy pastry & sweet, crushed walnut filling with some pistachio dust on top was so good. I actually took it home to share with Mr. Joy, who has a slight walnut allergy, but he didn't have a reaction to it. For an extra $2, this is a pretty good way to satisfy a sweet tooth. \n\nThere is usually a line around lunchtime, but there are lines everywhere at noon.

You look at the clock - by Jove, it's actually a reasonable hour for lunch!  You grab your coat, run out of the building, reach the street, and stop.  Now you must make a decision.  You could eat at Trendy Sandwich Shop No. 1, but you're not feeling particularly ritzy.  There's Salads'R'Us, but no - you need something heartier.  Perhaps you find yourself drifting down New Montgomery as you churn these thoughts over in your mind, heading towards no goal in particular, and then it hits you.  Like, really hard.  What is that smell?!  It smells like meat-and-spice-and-warm-and-hotsauce!  With...yes!  With a hint of fry!!  Yep.  Ayola just hit you.  And it felt like a kiss.  Or the preamble to a gyro.  Or maybe both.\n\nAs all of my legions of followers know, I recently professed a somewhat inappropriate passion for Baladie in the Financial District.  If Baladie is my pool boy, Ayola is the husband to whom I return, time and time again.  Why?  No, it's not a lifetime of codependency brought on by latent psychological issues.  It's because, goshdarnit, Ayola is a really solid place to get a mouthwatering and satisfying Greek meal.\n\nThe menu is rather small, as I've found is typical of Greek and Mediterranean places, featuring all of the familiar players - gyros, falafel, shawarma, Greek salads, hummus, dolmades, etc.  But they are expanding their menu - they've recently started making baba ganoush, and I can tell you it's really quite good!  I'm pretty sure they put olives into it and, if you're into that sort of thing it makes for a really nice variation on a classic dip.\n\nEven with a limited menu, you can trust that Ayola is going to take the classics and do them up right.  My favorite is the hortopita, and if you love eggplant like I love eggplant, it'll be your favorite, too.  The eggplant is cool, but melts in your mouth.  The toppings enhance it, without overshadowing it.  I could have probably done with more feta today, but I understand that the eggplant must remain the star of the show - and that being said, the ingredients all worked together in perfect harmony!  The pita wrapper was soft and fragrant and nice and toasty warm, and it was handed to me mere minutes after I ordered, even in the middle of the lunchtime rush!  \n\nSpecial mention also goes out to the dolmades.  Those things are like candy to me, and Ayola's are beautifully soft and chewy without swimming in oil.  No, instead, you can have them swim in the tub of tzatziki you get with them.  And if you're really on a budget, get the veggie combo plate.  You can probably share it with someone, but if you don't you'll have some killer leftovers!\n\nFor extra ambiance points, see if you can get a seat and wedge yourself onto a barstool in the corner.  It's crowded and not the comfiest seating of your life, but I feel it merely adds to the experience.  And plus, it sure beats taking the food back to your desk!\n\nSo if you're ever in SOMA and you need some really reliably awesome Greek food, Ayola is your place.  It never judges, it never expects too much of you, and it will always welcome you back with open arms.  But not open hands.  Its hands are full of falafel that it's going to stuff into your open and waiting mouth.  Boo.

I've gotten delivery from Ayola several times through DoorDash and usually bounce back and forth between either the chicken shawarma or a combo platter. \n\nRecommend: \nCHICKEN SHAWARMA is offered in either 7\" or 9\". I always get the 7\" but I also spring for the fries + soda combo. The fries are crispy outside and soft on the inside. I usually can't finish the whole meal because of the fries so I would save half of the shawarma for a late afternoon snack. Yay! Be forewarned that it gets messy eating this since they don't skimp on the chicken so have a fork or fingers ready to pick up the aftermath of your chicken falling off your shawarma. \n\nCOMBO PLATTER is a great way to get a bunch of sides as samplers. I think they have a set combo platter that has: hummus, dolmas, eggplant salad, falafel, and tzatziki sauce. AND it comes with pita bread. I also believe there is baba ganoush in the combo but it isn't listed on the menu. Really good deal if you're too indecisive to pick and choose items. It's also a great value since there's at least 5 items.

Crispy outside and flavorful inside. I like to dip it in the tzatziki sauce.\n-Baba ganoush: Slightly smoky flavor. Good to eat on its own.\n-Dolmas: I like the inside filling but the outside had a tad too much lemon juice. \n-Eggplant salad: Alright. Only enjoyed the eggplant. \n-Hummus: Average.
