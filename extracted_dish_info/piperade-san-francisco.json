I have the sense that they often do better than they did last night, but last night was \"off\" in a few important ways.\n\nI arrived quite early, at 6:45pm for a 7:15pm reservation; and as such, had absolutely no expectation that I would be seated early. My expectation was to have a cocktail at the bar and await my friend's arrival. However, since I was there anyway, I figured I'd announce myself to the Ma\u00eetre d so they would know I was present. So I did, then I went to take a seat at the bar, however there weren't any seats. So I walked outside and took a seat on the stairs of the chiropractor's office nextdoor and waited a bit. Understandable, so far everything was as one would expect.\n\nMy friend arrived and we announced ourselves at 7:10pm for our 7:15pm reservation. We were told that our table wasn't ready yet, but that there were two seats at the bar, and we were welcome to sit there until they were ready for us. So we walked through the crowded restaurant to the two seats at the back of the bar, to be informed by someone that they were \"saved\" for his two friends who were in the restroom. So we cancelled our order with the bartender and walked BACK to the front of the restaurant to wait again.\n\nAt 7:30pm we were told our table (7:15 reservation) was almost ready. And again at 7:45pm. At 7:50pm we were offered complimentary cocktails since we had to wait so long. At 8:00pm we were finally seated. In the meantime, I had to call and cancel an appointment I had made for after dinner; there was no way I could make it on time. That appointment had to be rescheduled for next Friday, as they had no other openings beforehand... so now my schedule for the week is skewed and my weekend plans have to be adjusted. Really annoying.\n\nThe food was fairly hit-or-miss. Credit where credit is due; the stuffed piquillo pepper was flavorful and delicious. Though the menu said peppers and it was, in reality, one small pepper (for $14). It was fantastic and totally worth getting, even at that price, but a bit misleading and I was already cranky at this point.\nWe ordered the pommes frites as well, and they were amongst the best shoestring french fries I've ever had. The Calamari Txipiroa, however, which was their special of the night, was really not a dish I enjoyed at all. I don't know what \"ink sauce\" is supposed to taste like, and perhaps the dish was prepared flawlessly and I simply have a peasant's palate, but to me the entire dish tasted like smoke and rice. I actually left it mostly unfinished on my plate. The orange blossom beignets somewhat made up for this, as they were perfection.\n\nIn summary, a delightful aesthetic, poor organization and time management, cursory efforts to compensate us for a fairly ridiculous wait, some really good dishes, some really unpleasant dishes, and pricey.\n\nI probably wouldn't return; in a city with so many high-end restaurants, I suspect that there's just better out there.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-10-01"}, {"excerpts": ["We shared a bunch of plates: Fried Manchego, Beef Crudo, Calamari \"a la Plancha\", \nStuffed Piquillo Peppers, Steamed White Sea Bass, Duck Confit, Pommes Frites, and Potato + Manchego Gratin (probably the best dish we had).\n\n"], "author": "Meredith K.", "review": "I wanted to like you, I really did...\nI was pretty disappointed all around.

Umm.. when the waiter brought the food, didn't I ask, \"Is this the medium rare?\" As for the other entrees.. well.. I have nothing good to say. The sea bass was very overcooked and bland.

We were seated in a smaller dining room off to the left of the host stand and for the first half of our meal we were alone. Separating our dining room with the other, more full dining room, is a wine cooler.\n\nI was here for a business meeting with five other people, so a variety of different food was tried and enjoyed. The very first thing we enjoyed was the bread. Even though the bread was cold, it still tasted good and instead of serving it with butter, bottles of olive oil are placed on the table. \n\nWe shared plates of the sea scallops, the four cheese plate, a crab cake, and bowls of tomato puree bisque. The scallops come with parsnip puree and a shaved apple salad. \n\nThe scallops were cooked beautifully, so I didn't have to pull a Gordan Ramsey and smash them against the table. The parsnip puree I couldn't taste much of but the shaved apple salad paired very well with the scallops. \n\nThe four cheese plate was minimal in quantity, but all four had amazing flavor. My favorites would have to be both the blue cheese, and the goat cheese that was served. The cheese is served with a Spanish fig cake that was very delicious and paired great with every piece of cheese on the plate. \n\nThe only \"cake\" like about the crab cake, was the shape. The circle of crab was very easy to pull apart with your fork for bite after bite of deliciousness. \n\nThree of us ordered the tomato bisque, which were then passed around so all could try. It tasted pretty good, but nothing too special. \n\nFor my entree I ordered the blue nose sea bass, which was served with saut\u00e9ed spinach and fried garlic vinaigrette. My first time having bass, and I must say I am now a fan: Very flaky, and with marvelous flavor. The bass was great but the spinach with the garlic vinaigrette was spectacular. I could have probably eaten plate after plate of just that. \n\nI was able to sample a bite of both the pork cheeks and the prunes they are served with. Both are excellent. The cheeks are tender, and the prunes are just delicious. \n\nAlso must have are the potato and manchego gratin. We had four orders of this, and all four orders were completly emply by the time we left. I would say this dish was probably the star of the night. \n\nFour of us ordered the same cocktail. The Elkano: Two of us hated it. The other two LOVED it. I fall into the \"Love\" column. Being that I love rum and being that this drink really packs the rum into it, plus adding all the fruity flavors to it, the drink was pretty damn good. \n\nThe service was pretty OK and average.

The beignets themselves, hallowed and crunchy, could not have possibly been made any better.

The bartender was so personable - the cocktail was perfection. I really like this bar. We ate at the bar that night and I have to say I will be doing that many more times. \nThis is a beautiful dining experience - worth every penny you may spend. This establishment is seriously devoted to making your experience within its 4 walls worth the effort of the visit. I hope they save a seat at the bar for me......this Wednesday.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-04-11"}], "lsagarra": [], "winter in biarritz": []}
