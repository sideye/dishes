This curry is more authentic and far better than any curry you will get in an Indian restaurant in the U.S. Bow down to the awesomeness that is chicken chow!\n\nI loved their generous portion size and very reasonable pricing of $8.00. You can definitely share an order with 2 people.\n\nWhen you read the poster on their wall, the fact that it tastes like South Indian curry is unsurprising.

Amawale's Frickadelle roll comes in a baguette with 2 large beef meatballs, a small amount of lettuce, fresh floppy vinegar soaked potato chips, and plenty of their peri peri hot sauce.

Large portions of extremely delicious food at very good prices.  I didn't have any reference for food from South Africa going in, but I fear I am now going to have cravings way to often.  Their Bunny Chow (a chicken and potato curry in a hollowed out loaf of South African bread) is to die for!!  I can't wait to go back and have again.  I also had the Slap Chip Sandwich - a meatball patty with succulent and spicy sauces and South African \"chips\" (french fries) served on a hearty roll that I would recommend to anyone looking for a creative and kickass take on the American burger.

If you are the type of person who enjoys the experience of an explosion of flavors in your mouth, this is definitely the place for you!

Bunny Chow would be the way to go for having an spicy experience. For those who are taking care of their diet, the paleo meals are a great option. I personally like the chicken curry wrap, it has the perfect combination of flavors, it is not spicy and it is filling. I really like the wrap, which is called roti, NOT tortilla. Me being Hispanic, means that I know what a tortilla is and they are both very different. Roti is a traditional flat bread that complements many dishes in South African cuisine. It is usually handmade, rolled and cut into perfect circles. Amawele's roti have a some sweetness that adds an extra special touch to the chicken curry wrap.

March,  2018. You will be full. \n\nLet that sink in.\n\nOK, so I may be biased because I don't work in Downtown, but I have friends who do and they tell me about the ridiculous downtown prices for lunch. Your experience may vary. \n\nTheir menu is small, but definitely unique. Cape malay rice/quinoa. Peri-peri chicken. Frikadella slap chip. Bunny chow. \n\nNo bunnies were hurt in the process of making bunny chow. \n\nI don't think the bunnies will like bunny chow very much either. \n\nI decided to try the frikadella slap chip roll (as in on a bread roll, not a wrap). The chips were fries, slathered in a pink, spicy, vinegary, creamy sauce, hundled together with Dutch style meatballs (frikadella) on a roll. \n\nYes, it's a lobster roll without the lobster.\nYes, it's technically a meatball sub.\nYes, it's a starch fest. \nNo, I'm not on a roll, but the meatballs are.\n\nYou can thank the people who designed that certain T-shirt. You know which one I'm talking about. If you don't, ask a friend. \n\nEating was a challenge. It was pain, it was pleasure, but I guess, no pain, no gain? The roll was too big to shove in my face, the fries too hot, and it was dripping sauce everywhere. Anyone who's had an authentic vindaloo or buffalo wings know vinegar turns spice into pain. Then the cream in the sauce comes to the rescue like the creamy dressing that comes with wings. It's a perpetual mind frik to continually jab your face with fries, bite, exhale as the vinegar drill spice into every corner of your mouth, wow your mouth, and repeat. \n\nFrik is also what they say to the cook when someone orders the frikadella slap chip roll. I don't blame them. \n\nBefore I left, I saw a man receive his bunny chow, a half load of bread loaded with what looks to be their curry. Makes sense. South Africa had/has a lot of Indians and Malays. It wasn't half a loaf of the Wonderbread (or whatever American sized loaf you may use), but it was at least as long as it was wide, stuffed with curry.

Tucked in the far corner, you could easily miss this new addition if you're not aware of its existence.  It feels less like fast food and more like eating from a mom & pop stand.  I know they're relatively new, but I'd love to see some South African drinks and desserts offered.\n\nVetkoek & Ground Beef Curry: Probably my favorite dish on the menu; I mean it literally translates to \"fat cake\"!  It's basically a savory doughnut (no sugar at all) sliced halfway and stuffed with a generous helping of runny ground beef curry.  The fried dough does a brilliant job of soaking up the curry, especially the bottom-center portion of each vetkoek.\n\nChicken Bunny Chow: A thick block of white bread, about a quarter of a loaf, hollowed out and filled with a sultry chicken and potato curry.  Served with a side of tangy marinated carrot shavings which helped cut the richness of the curry.  Apparently it is a pretty authentic South African specialty, originated by Indian immigrants.  It was definitely very filling, I had to take some back to the office for an afternoon snack.\n\nDurban Chicken Curry Roti: Essentially the same chicken/potato/carrot filling as in the bunny chow, expect with a few strands of lettuce.  The roti was thick, more like a Caribbean roti than an India roti.  It held the curry pretty well, despite the filling being so saucy.  Seemed a little skimpy on the chicken though, but other than that, it was totally delicious.\n\nCape Malay Rice: Another permutation of the chicken curry, this time mixed in with rice and tons of vegetables.  Feels like one of the healthier menu options, but that doesn't mean it skimps on taste.  I'd even say this rice dish is tastier than Pakistani biryani since it has so much flavor (especially if you ask for spicy)!\n\nFrikadella Slap Chip Roll: Apparently it's the Danish version of a meatball; the grilled meat pucks totally reminded me of a Middle Eastern kofta kebab though.  Minced meat with tons of veggies and spices.  Served in a medium sized hoagie roll slathered in a very tasty creamy and spicy sauce.
