It was a rather unexciting use of afternoon snack calories.\n\nMeyer Lemon Bar: A lot better than I expected.  Quite smooth and tangy, with mostly filling and only a little crust (just the way I like).  Also, it didn't have that funky sour milk smell that a lot of lemon curd has.\n\nCaff\u00e8 Mocha: Nowhere near as sweet as the equivalent at Starbucks.  But I'm ok with that since it lets you still appreciate the coffee.  The largest size available is a medium, but is just the right size to sit and enjoy from a proper glass at the cafe.\n\nNitro Coffee: This was quite foamy, like a Guinness.  Went down very smoothly.

Usually it will be at a long counter with the whole row of espresso cups lined up with all the patrons come and grab one.\n\nThis is more like a fancy cafe where if you want to sit and enjoy a conversation with some pastries. The way they take out the pastries is like taking out some jewel from the glass case (in this case I think it's plastic but looks sparkling translucent), delicately. I have to admit, the fancy way how the case door opens up, instead of more typical sliding door, is like opening a lambo vs a cab door. Because, also then, the cafe has lots and lots of space.\n\nItalian beans, in my books, are lighter roast and more delicate. The taste is smoother than a punch, but the strong current still electrifies you afterwards.\n\nI had a cannoli and it was also very, very delicious.
