Tater Tot had a grooming appointment in North Beach so what better way to kill time than to knock off some of my North Beach bookmarks.\n\nI've had II Casaro bookmarked since they opened in early 2014 so I was super ecstatic to finally pay a visit especially with all the glowing reviews. However, after our visit, I was scratching my head as to where all these glowing reviews are coming from (mainly from tourists). I held off on writing my review in the event our experience was an off day. With some recent bad reviews, our experience is unlikely a fluke so here we go...\n\nSorry folks, this is another overrated North Beach restaurant for tourists. Their current 76/100 health score is a bit scary as well especially with an open kitchen. \n\nII Casaro's menu: Antipasti (fried cheese, meatballs, aracini), Mozzarella Bar, Salumi (prosciutto, spicy coppa, mortadella), Piatti (tagliatelle, spaghetti, lasagna, gnocchi), and Pizzas (12+ options). Prices are really reasonable for this touristy area with mains in the $14-$16 range. Reservations accepted. \n\nWe started with the Imported Burrata & Proscuitto San Daniele ($7.75, $8): http://bit.ly/1MKvxPt. The burrata was hands down the best I've had. It was deliciously milky and soft with a tinge of sea salt and pepper to make it pop. I could eat this all day with the accompanying flatbread. I'm totally lactose intolerant (and had no lactaid) which made for a fun ride home with my dining companion. *emoji with medical mask* The prosciutto was ehhh; very salty and very lean.\n\nIf you're looking for deliciously tender balls, look elsewhere. The Polpette Al Sugo: Ground Beef Meatballs, Napoleon Sugo ($7): http://bit.ly/1IVSejR was by far the worst meatballs I've had. They were hard, dense, and clearly overworked. I've had better balls at Buca Di Beppo which is pretty sad. Best meatballs ever can be found nearby at Tosca Caf\u00e9. It's $4 for a tiny golf ball sized meatball but they're life changing. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night was the pizza. We shared the Broccoli + Salsiccia: Scamorza Cheese, Broccoli Rabe, Italian Sausage ($16.50 + $4 egg): http://bit.ly/1DnpfU1. The pizza was amazing to look at with its alluring leopard spots but it seriously made me want to cry. As soon as I picked up a slice, all the toppings slid off to reveal a bottom crust drenched in liquid. Now, I know Neapolitan pizzas are supposed to be a little soggy in the center but the center was like a wet sponge. We had to tear off the center crust and just eat the outer crust. The sausage was flavorless and very dry (tasted like turkey sausage) while the broccoli rabe was very bitter. Not a good combo. Who doesn't love a little egg porn? Well, there was egg porn in all its glory but the egg white was still translucent and raw (when you cut it). The menu stated it was $3 for \"eggs\" but we were charged $4 for one egg. WTF. \n\nOur waitress was really nice which was redeeming and it wasn't crowded so we got our food rather quickly. For the hour we were there, the owner or manager (?) was sitting at one of the four top tables in front on his ipad and talking on his cellphone. This was rather unprofessional. \n\nWe went on a Saturday and reservations were not needed as it wasn't even busy. When we left during peak dinner time, it was less than 1/4th filled with tourists.

We shared a slice of the lasagna, which offered a delicious blend of tomatoes, spices and meat. Our final main dish was the Calabrese pizza - very yummy, except the sausage was a little too spicy for me. To cool my mouth, I ended the meal with their soft serve ice cream topped with caramel sauce. I loved every bite. I highly recommend this restaurant.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-08-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The bread strips served with this dish were magnificently charred, soft as silk, and drizzled with potent premium olive oil (no canola blend detected). "], "author": "Elliott D.", "review": "TL;DR:\n\nFor the love of tastebuds, have I not been transported to Napoli itself with these familiar flavors!? Yes, brethren & sisters, I've been to the Old Country and supped at its greatest pie houses. This is an experience not less glorious.\n\nTHE DEETS:\n\n***IMPORTED BURRATA\n\nThough many a burrata have I ravaged, I do declare that never until today have I experienced burrata as it was truly intended. This celestial dairy must have poured forth from the most holy of golden calves, hand-fed the hand-manicured artisanal grass of an immortal world. The milk & cream from this cow are superior to all before it, and the cheese-making methods employed here are esoteric & second to none. There is no toughness, only gooey joy. When you bite in, the fresh panna flows forth as a divine gift.\n\nThe bread strips served with this dish were magnificently charred, soft as silk, and drizzled with potent premium olive oil (no canola blend detected). With it was a simple arugula & grape tomato salad, which masterfully satisfied the need for complexity by offering bitter & sweet notes.\n\nI'd come back for this dish alone.\n\n***DIAVOLA PIZZA - Mozzarella, tomato sauce, spicy salami\n\nI've searched high & low for true Napoli pizza on this continent and have not once found crust so beautifully charred and yet perfectly supple. Surely a sign of doppio zero flour. It was so soft that you could roll it up and wipe your face with it. The sauce was infinitely light & as delicately fruity as can be, enabling you to eat slice after slice without being bogged down by the slightest shadow of heaviness. The fact that they stuck \"Mozzarella Bar\" as part of the establishment's name corroborates my experience--these were sinfully moist, meaty, & yet somehow light chunks of moo product. And yes, the crucial basil centerpiece was equally toasted & wilted as is the divine degree.\n\nThe soft red chillies & spicy salami was a lovely treat, providing just enough heat & flavor without overwhelming the batch. \n\n***PROSCIUTTO PIZZA - San Daniele prosciutto, arugula, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese\n\nThe crust, sauce, & mozzarella were just as meticulous & present as the last pizza; in addition, this pie was topped with delicious prosciutto, arugula, & raspadura shavings. The prosciutto provided a luxuriously moist layer, while the arugula offered some pleasant bitter contrast. The raspadura, while extremely fresh and flavorful, was in my opinion slightly excessive due to the dry nature of the cheese and the copious amounts that had to be consumed to get to the pizza below. Still, if generosity was their fault, the quality of the ingredients made this more than forgivable.\n\n***PANNA COTTA with raspberry sauce\n\nI've had more panna cotta than I can recall, but the consistency of this product (as had become a theme throughout the meal with each additional dairy offering) was much more refined & dare-I-say velvetier that anything I'd previously encountered. It was truly a cream-filled delight, finished gracefully with fresh vanilla bean seeds & tangy raspberry pur\u00e9e.\n__\n\nJust remember, you're very welcome.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-07-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the mussels, burrata salad, and olive cesaro pizza.

We seriously come here once a week. \n\nEverything is made to order and all the ingredients are top notch. \n\nWe always get the burrata with spicy coppa to start.

If you've never tried burrata, it's like eating heavenly pillows of cheese that gently caresses your mouth. Must try.\n\nMy favorite favorite pizza here is the Prosciutto. They shave fresh parmesan on top and watching it melt slightly but still hold its structure is one of my favorite things to see in the world. I would frame it in an art installation if I could - if I didn't eat it first. Every bite is a perfect balance of meat and cheese and sauce and crust. \n\nMy second favorite is Capricciosa because the olives, artichoke, and mushroom add a lot of extra flavor but is so simple still.\n\nThe crust on their pizzas is so light that it doesn't over power any of the other ingredients. It's not too salty or oily or thick. And I love using the crust to mop up the extra sauce and oil. And because the oil they use is so good, you don't feel disgusting eating it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great, too. I like sitting at the bar so I can watch them make the pizzas. They also have three TVs that always have some sort of games on, which tones down any sort of pretentiousness the scratch made nature of the place might get.\n\nI'm only scared that this place will get too popular and I won't be able to get a seat right away on a Friday night.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-10-21"}, {"excerpts": ["Served with Arugula, good olive oil, grape tomatoes sliced in half and pizza crust points.

I guess it makes sense that he'd want to find that here.\n\nWell, his search led us (along with his wife) to Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar after a YEE in SF. Parking was typical SF, a total CharlieFoxtrot. But we eventually got lucky & squeezed into a street space a few blocks away. Walking in, the place was about 1/2 full & we got a table right away.\n\nService was sort of friendly & fairly attentive. We ordered Burrata & Asparagi to start + Margherita & Diavola pizzas. Our starters were served in short time. Both were excellent & seemed to be a good sign of things to come.\n\nOur pizzas, curiously, took a while. When they finally did make their appearance at our, they looked fine. But were just OK once we started chowing down on both. The general consensus around the table was that both pizzas were average, not the best, not the worst.\n\nAltogether, eating at Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar was OK. As far as finding the New World's best Margherita pizza in the SF Bay Area, the search goes on. There's certainly no shortage of pizza joints around here, so my friend still has lots of choices to fuel his obsession.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-09-20"}], "mozzarella in carrozza": [{"excerpts": ["Menu changed and I'm missing some of my favorites like mozzarella in carrozza. \n", "Last time I visited with family (party of 5 - all Italians, mind you!) for evening pizza.

Tater Tot had a grooming appointment in North Beach so what better way to kill time than to knock off some of my North Beach bookmarks.\n\nI've had II Casaro bookmarked since they opened in early 2014 so I was super ecstatic to finally pay a visit especially with all the glowing reviews. However, after our visit, I was scratching my head as to where all these glowing reviews are coming from (mainly from tourists). I held off on writing my review in the event our experience was an off day. With some recent bad reviews, our experience is unlikely a fluke so here we go...\n\nSorry folks, this is another overrated North Beach restaurant for tourists. Their current 76/100 health score is a bit scary as well especially with an open kitchen. \n\nII Casaro's menu: Antipasti (fried cheese, meatballs, aracini), Mozzarella Bar, Salumi (prosciutto, spicy coppa, mortadella), Piatti (tagliatelle, spaghetti, lasagna, gnocchi), and Pizzas (12+ options). Prices are really reasonable for this touristy area with mains in the $14-$16 range. Reservations accepted. \n\nWe started with the Imported Burrata & Proscuitto San Daniele ($7.75, $8): http://bit.ly/1MKvxPt. The burrata was hands down the best I've had. It was deliciously milky and soft with a tinge of sea salt and pepper to make it pop. I could eat this all day with the accompanying flatbread. I'm totally lactose intolerant (and had no lactaid) which made for a fun ride home with my dining companion. *emoji with medical mask* The prosciutto was ehhh; very salty and very lean.\n\nIf you're looking for deliciously tender balls, look elsewhere. The Polpette Al Sugo: Ground Beef Meatballs, Napoleon Sugo ($7): http://bit.ly/1IVSejR was by far the worst meatballs I've had. They were hard, dense, and clearly overworked. I've had better balls at Buca Di Beppo which is pretty sad. Best meatballs ever can be found nearby at Tosca Caf\u00e9. It's $4 for a tiny golf ball sized meatball but they're life changing. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night was the pizza. We shared the Broccoli + Salsiccia: Scamorza Cheese, Broccoli Rabe, Italian Sausage ($16.50 + $4 egg): http://bit.ly/1DnpfU1. The pizza was amazing to look at with its alluring leopard spots but it seriously made me want to cry. As soon as I picked up a slice, all the toppings slid off to reveal a bottom crust drenched in liquid. Now, I know Neapolitan pizzas are supposed to be a little soggy in the center but the center was like a wet sponge. We had to tear off the center crust and just eat the outer crust. The sausage was flavorless and very dry (tasted like turkey sausage) while the broccoli rabe was very bitter. Not a good combo. Who doesn't love a little egg porn? Well, there was egg porn in all its glory but the egg white was still translucent and raw (when you cut it). The menu stated it was $3 for \"eggs\" but we were charged $4 for one egg. WTF. \n\nOur waitress was really nice which was redeeming and it wasn't crowded so we got our food rather quickly. For the hour we were there, the owner or manager (?) was sitting at one of the four top tables in front on his ipad and talking on his cellphone. This was rather unprofessional. \n\nWe went on a Saturday and reservations were not needed as it wasn't even busy. When we left during peak dinner time, it was less than 1/4th filled with tourists. Plenty of seating (high tops) for larger groups.\n\nSorry II Casaro, I just wasn't feeling you...even after several drinks at The Boardroom.

We seriously come here once a week. \n\nEverything is made to order and all the ingredients are top notch. \n\nWe always get the burrata with spicy coppa to start. It comes bread they made right in the brick oven. The burrata is drizzled with olive oil so pure you can drink it. If you've never tried burrata, it's like eating heavenly pillows of cheese that gently caresses your mouth. Must try.\n\nMy favorite favorite pizza here is the Prosciutto. They shave fresh parmesan on top and watching it melt slightly but still hold its structure is one of my favorite things to see in the world. I would frame it in an art installation if I could - if I didn't eat it first. Every bite is a perfect balance of meat and cheese and sauce and crust. \n\nMy second favorite is Capricciosa because the olives, artichoke, and mushroom add a lot of extra flavor but is so simple still.\n\nThe crust on their pizzas is so light that it doesn't over power any of the other ingredients. It's not too salty or oily or thick. And I love using the crust to mop up the extra sauce and oil. And because the oil they use is so good, you don't feel disgusting eating it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great, too. I like sitting at the bar so I can watch them make the pizzas. They also have three TVs that always have some sort of games on, which tones down any sort of pretentiousness the scratch made nature of the place might get.\n\nI'm only scared that this place will get too popular and I won't be able to get a seat right away on a Friday night.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-10-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the calzone, prosciutto pizza, spicy coppa plate, and a plate of burrata.

The Polpette Al Sugo: Ground Beef Meatballs, Napoleon Sugo ($7): http://bit.ly/1IVSejR was by far the worst meatballs I've had. They were hard, dense, and clearly overworked. I've had better balls at Buca Di Beppo which is pretty sad. Best meatballs ever can be found nearby at Tosca Caf\u00e9. It's $4 for a tiny golf ball sized meatball but they're life changing. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night was the pizza. We shared the Broccoli + Salsiccia: Scamorza Cheese, Broccoli Rabe, Italian Sausage ($16.50 + $4 egg): http://bit.ly/1DnpfU1. The pizza was amazing to look at with its alluring leopard spots but it seriously made me want to cry. As soon as I picked up a slice, all the toppings slid off to reveal a bottom crust drenched in liquid. Now, I know Neapolitan pizzas are supposed to be a little soggy in the center but the center was like a wet sponge. We had to tear off the center crust and just eat the outer crust. The sausage was flavorless and very dry (tasted like turkey sausage) while the broccoli rabe was very bitter. Not a good combo. Who doesn't love a little egg porn? Well, there was egg porn in all its glory but the egg white was still translucent and raw (when you cut it). The menu stated it was $3 for \"eggs\" but we were charged $4 for one egg. WTF. \n\nOur waitress was really nice which was redeeming and it wasn't crowded so we got our food rather quickly. For the hour we were there, the owner or manager (?) was sitting at one of the four top tables in front on his ipad and talking on his cellphone. This was rather unprofessional. \n\nWe went on a Saturday and reservations were not needed as it wasn't even busy. When we left during peak dinner time, it was less than 1/4th filled with tourists. Plenty of seating (high tops) for larger groups.\n\nSorry II Casaro, I just wasn't feeling you...even after several drinks at The Boardroom. Maybe, Mr. Viagra can help ya.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["IMPORTED BURRATA\n\n"], "author": "Elliott D.", "review": "TL;DR:\n\nFor the love of tastebuds, have I not been transported to Napoli itself with these familiar flavors!? Yes, brethren & sisters, I've been to the Old Country and supped at its greatest pie houses. This is an experience not less glorious.\n\nTHE DEETS:\n\n***IMPORTED BURRATA\n\nThough many a burrata have I ravaged, I do declare that never until today have I experienced burrata as it was truly intended. This celestial dairy must have poured forth from the most holy of golden calves, hand-fed the hand-manicured artisanal grass of an immortal world. The milk & cream from this cow are superior to all before it, and the cheese-making methods employed here are esoteric & second to none. There is no toughness, only gooey joy. When you bite in, the fresh panna flows forth as a divine gift.\n\nThe bread strips served with this dish were magnificently charred, soft as silk, and drizzled with potent premium olive oil (no canola blend detected). With it was a simple arugula & grape tomato salad, which masterfully satisfied the need for complexity by offering bitter & sweet notes.\n\nI'd come back for this dish alone.\n\n***DIAVOLA PIZZA - Mozzarella, tomato sauce, spicy salami\n\nI've searched high & low for true Napoli pizza on this continent and have not once found crust so beautifully charred and yet perfectly supple. Surely a sign of doppio zero flour. It was so soft that you could roll it up and wipe your face with it. The sauce was infinitely light & as delicately fruity as can be, enabling you to eat slice after slice without being bogged down by the slightest shadow of heaviness. The fact that they stuck \"Mozzarella Bar\" as part of the establishment's name corroborates my experience--these were sinfully moist, meaty, & yet somehow light chunks of moo product. And yes, the crucial basil centerpiece was equally toasted & wilted as is the divine degree.\n\nThe soft red chillies & spicy salami was a lovely treat, providing just enough heat & flavor without overwhelming the batch. \n\n***PROSCIUTTO PIZZA - San Daniele prosciutto, arugula, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese\n\nThe crust, sauce, & mozzarella were just as meticulous & present as the last pizza; in addition, this pie was topped with delicious prosciutto, arugula, & raspadura shavings. The prosciutto provided a luxuriously moist layer, while the arugula offered some pleasant bitter contrast. The raspadura, while extremely fresh and flavorful, was in my opinion slightly excessive due to the dry nature of the cheese and the copious amounts that had to be consumed to get to the pizza below. Still, if generosity was their fault, the quality of the ingredients made this more than forgivable.\n\n***PANNA COTTA with raspberry sauce\n\nI've had more panna cotta than I can recall, but the consistency of this product (as had become a theme throughout the meal with each additional dairy offering) was much more refined & dare-I-say velvetier that anything I'd previously encountered. It was truly a cream-filled delight, finished gracefully with fresh vanilla bean seeds & tangy raspberry pur\u00e9e.\n__\n\nJust remember, you're very welcome.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-07-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Imported Burrata, the Gnocchi, the Margherita, Quattro Formaggi, and the Capricciosa pizzas.

I began to scroll through the photos, focusing on the \"type\" I was looking for tonight - Italian. Gorgeous photos of pizza were everywhere. But I'd been through so many of them before. Sure, they were fine, but I was sure that tonight I could do better. Some were clearly gold-diggers (Tony & his $45 pizza - yikes). I started to despair. Maybe this whole internet thing just isn't for me. Maybe I should just go old-school and call an old regular.\n\nBut remember, I'm lazy so I persevered. Suddenly, I came upon Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar. The pictures were all I needed to see, not to mention the elevation of amazing mozzarellas in the very name. It was love at first sight.

Casual, clean, modern feel (which happens to be my style so I was obviously a fan).  And the price is RIGHT!!!

We placed our order and requested for it to all come at the same time. \n\nWe ordered: burrata mozzarella, margherita pizza, marinara pizza, bucatini pasta.\n\nHaving just gone back from a trip to Italy we were ready for some pizza and this place delivered. The dough is thin, tasty and the tomato sauce is superb. Why did this remind us of an authentic Napoli pizza? The center is soft, tender and the cheese is soupy in the middle- yummy. We would definitely come back to try all the other pizza. \n\nThe burrata was creamy and soft. My boys devoured it and claimed it to be so close to the ones they had in Italy. \n\nThe bucatini pasta was aldente. The sauce was perfectly balanced by a hint of sweetness from the onions. We cleaned off the bowl with our pizza dough. \n\nOverall, really good place to eat and experience oven wood pizza Napoli style. The place has more of an upscale, hip vibe to it that we did feel a bit out of place (with 2 boys with us). Seems like the manager was walking and talking to everyone but  never managed to acknowledge us- which is fine, we had a great server (May have been the busy Saturday afternoon too). \n\nOverall, I give it 4 stars. Our pizza came much later after we've already finished our other 2 meals (we were sharing all the meals).

They have a wood-fired oven which is good.\n\nI got a seat at the counter and enjoyed watching the pizzaiolo make the pizze. It took a while to get a menu and order. I ordered the pizza magrherita and a beer. They have like six beers on tap and two in bottles but the waiter said they were out of all the beers except for Sierra Pale Ale. How can you be out of seven beers?\n\nI saw they were slicing the pizze before delivery. How odd, I thought. So, I leaned toward the glass and told the pizzaiolo that I didn't want my pizza cut. So, naturally, he cut it and handed it to me over the glass. I should have refused it, but I didn't. Big mistake. The reason you don't cut the pizza is so that the soggy middle doesn't seep under the crust and make it soggy and that's exactly what happened. \n\nAlso, for my taste, it was a little too undercooked and doughy. They have a marinara pizza listed with ingredients other that just sauce and garlic. HUH? What kind of marinara pizza is that? \n\nThe price was OK at $13.00 for the pizza and $6.00 for the beer.\n\nThe search continues for authentic Napolitano pizza in San Francisco.

Probably one of the only few Italian places around here that have great reviews and don't have a long wait. (Tony's and other places are 1.5+ hr) We were seated as soon as we got in, ordered our food, and the pizzas came within 5 minutes :)\n\nThe restaurant has its giant open windows to the street, so you can feel the breeze and see the people walking by. Very comfortable and welcoming. If you are lucky, you can even get a seat at the bar counter where you can watch the chefs roll out the pizzas and bake them in a wood oven. \n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas, Prosciutto and Norma. The size was a lot smaller than I expected, based off the price. Both pizza crust were very thin and soggy.  I could hardly pick up a piece without letting all the toppings drip and fall down my hand. However, the flavors were really good. \n \nWe especially enjoyed the Prosciutto pizza.  Prosciutto was very flavorful. In addition to the amazing melted mozzarella, the pizza was topped with large pieces of unmelted shredded cheese -  surprisingly good! Norma pizza was a basic Margarita pizza topped with eggplant. Simple flavors, yet delicious. But it was a lot more soggy than Prosciutto pizza....  Along side the pizzas, there were red chili soaked in spicy oil. It was SO GOOD! Gives the pizza a great kick of spice. When you're done with the middle part of your pizza slice, dip the end crust into the spicy oil - trust me, you will leave no crusts behind! \n\nOverall, fairly delicious pizza restaurant with great atmosphere. It's a great place to go if you cannot bear the wait at the other famous pizza restaurants.  \n\n\nFavorites: \n* Prosciutto pizza ($18.75) - San Daniele prosciutto, arugula, tomato sauce, mozzarella, cheese\n\nOther orders: \n* Norma pizza ($15.75) - mozzarella, tomato sauce, ricotta salata, fried eggplant", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-12"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered two pizzas and asked for extra eggplant on the Norma Pizza and extra sauce on the Capricciosa Pizza.
