I ordered the Rare Beef Pho with chow fun noodles (special request) which was around $9.50, scoped out a little table in the back, and popped in a podcast while I waited. The space is cozy, I guess, but the open door to Battery made the place a little on the freezing side. \n\nMy giant, steaming bowl arrived a few minutes later. Much to my satisfaction, they have fish sauce and swiftly brought me extra jalepenos. Now to the food. \n\nI must keep it real, folks: I have had better pho. The noodles were great, but it's relatively easy to find a pho spot that offers chow fun noodles. The meat was not as fresh as it could have been, already tough and cooked through by the time it hit the table. The broth was on the sweet side and had a ton of lemongrass in it.
