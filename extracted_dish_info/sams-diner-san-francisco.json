And when we were there everyone who looked at the menu posted outside went inside and ate.  \n\nThe food is a mixture of American and Korean. They also have a specialty menu such as The Aladdin Menu which has recipes with names based on the show & characters such as Princess Jasmine's Honey Roasted Brussel Sprouts, A Whole New World of Warm Falafel Appetizers, etc.  And they gluten free, vegan and vegetarian choices. Something for everyone.\n\nWe started out with the Bulgogi Loaded Tots. This was tater tots, bulgogi, kimchi, spicy Korean sauce, Chipotle Ailoi and cilantro.

I am always a sucker for special menus with special prices, and if you tell them you are going to the show, you actually get 10% off of your meal you get there too. Pretty good deal. \n\nPlus they have a beer and wine license now (so yes that means the bloody mary on their cocktail list is not made with vodka, so beware!). $4.50 for most beers on tap is pretty good, but $4 for a PBR in a bottle? That is kind of nuts, even for SF prices. \n\nFood wise, we were all pretty happy with our dishes--I got their crab melt which was toasted pretty much perfectly and had an ample amount of avocado in it too which was the really reason I ordered it (I may have a clinical obsession for things with avocado ha). Adam G. got their honey fried chicken which was pretty darn tasty and very moist inside, but I have to say the coleslaw and the potatoes were just so so. My dad got the steak and minus a few pieces of fat on it he had to eat around, he was pretty content indeed. And my mom got the lion named burger and it was pretty big, almost like a lion. We ended with the chocolate molten cake which also was good, but we all sort of felt like have we had better diner food elsewhere? Sure. But can you get much better than this being a block from the theater? Probably not.

We looked online for a reasonably priced place close to the theater. We had low expectations.\n\nThe host who sat us was extremely friendly to all the guests in the line, and he created a very welcoming environment. After taking a seat, we took a look at the beer menu, and I was really impressed that a little diner had such a great tap beer selection.\n\nAnd onto the food ~ while it is a diner, the food is definitely a couple notches up from diner quality. My buddy had the korean tacos, and I had one of the three it came with, and they were delicious. I had the honey fried chicken, and that was quite good as well. My wife got the sliders, and those were also good.\n\nAll in all, food's good. Drink's are good. Service is good.
