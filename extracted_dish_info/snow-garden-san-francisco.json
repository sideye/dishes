We wanted Chinese food and this place was close and received 4 stars. The outside and the inside look very hole-in-the-wall ish but it has been my experience that some holes-in-the-walls serve amazingly authentic food. The inside is small--about 10 or so tables. On the day, we went it was very understaffed--one waiter, one cleaning lady and one chef so service was sloooooooooww.
