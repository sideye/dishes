First of all, it's a fun place to be.  They really did a good job with the decor, which would be less remarkable if it weren't replacing Tasty Curry, which, while completely edible, was sometimes a sad place to be.  (Anybody ever go there for the lunch buffet on a weekday?  No?  That's what I thought.)  The same space looks absolutely beautiful now that Masala Dosa got their hands on it.  It's a very dark space, but very elegant.  It's not too cool for school, though - Masala Dosa is a great place to take a date, but I've also seen whole families, with babies in tow, chow down together.\n\nAnd chow down they should, because Masala Dosa's food is some of the tastiest around.  I will admit I had never had a dosa before, so my opinion of that might not be terribly useful to you all.  But I liked it!  We had the egg dosa, which was just the right amount of eggy and crepey.  We also had the idly, which are dense little suckers!  The texture is so homey and warm and filling - and they're served with delicious chutneys!

But all is well.  The new place is uphill and upscale.  The old one had a crowded dining room and a patio nobody seemed to use; this version has a spacious and elegant room.  If Curry Village across the way is for large hungry groups, Masala Dosa is a date night restaurant, where you would not feel out of place in a suit or cocktail dress (though they don't serve alcohol).  Not that they have an actual dress code, with Craigslist next door that would not be a good idea, since the scruffy Indian guy next to you is probably a software engineer if not a UCSF med student.  And they happily seated two women in the window.  OK, the food.  Said friend is from Kerala, makes great dosas herself, and considers the food here both tops and authentic.  The dosas are like crepes or a wrap, with various meat or veggie fillings.  The uttapams are made from the same chickpea/rice flour base (gluten-free), but with the fillings baked on top - some people call them an Indian pizza, but don't mistake that for anything like what a couple of Sunset restaurants serve as \"Indian Pizza\".  There are also various biryani and curry dishes, plus appetizers such as iddly, which looks like a large marshmellow, and which is used like a chip for dipping.  I really like the chicken biryani, and am disappointed that one dish to have disappeared is the veggie Kashmiri Biryani, with dried fruits & nuts.  But it was North Indian, so it didn't make the cut.  As with most Indian restaurants, desserts are not much.

But, the steep prices are validated: Masala Dosa is staged as a higher-end Indian restaurant than Curry Village or Naan N' Curry, so, adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\n(PASS ON THE) $6 EGGPLANT PAKORA: fresh eggplant dipped in chick pea batter and fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=DJUKjAUgUbAZnjxp6gxe-A#DJUKjAUgUbAZnjxp6gxe-A)\n- This dish ain't my piece o' cake. It's like the Indian version of tempura, except the chick pea batter isn't fried to a crisp, which leaves the pakora somewhat soggy. Add that to the flavorless nature of eggplant, and you're left with something mushily tasteless. Albeit, the mint chutney and sweet tamarind sauces are delicious and are meant to deliver a large component of flavor, but then I might as well just lap up those bowls of sauce. As if I don't already do that, haaaa. Shhhhhh.\n\n(OMG YOU BETTER GET THE) $13 CHICKEN KORMA: tandoori chicken cooked in a clay oven stewed in a cashew cream sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ#3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ)\n- Ridic delish. You should order this. And then, you should order this again. Yes, $13 is a bit of moolah for a dish that's usually less than $10, but just play some mind games and tell yourself it's $12.99 instead.\n- The bowl is small. Well, that's probably a mind game too. I bet it's actually the same size since the food is served in a normal bowl rather than those typical flat saucer dishes. Despite the small bowl, there's a heckuva lot of tandoori chicken chunks--I would say 8 or 9. And that beautifully moist chicken is what makes this dish addictive. This is most definitely the moistest chicken I've ever had in an Indian dish. And it doesn't help that the cashew cream sauce is liquid crack.\n\n(IF YOU WANNA, GET THE) $12 CHICKEN MASALA DOSA (dosas not available through online ordering): thin crepe with potatoes and chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=jYk3XRjZMohJGoKUUav3kg#T4Wfxp2FcovJNI19V75K7g)\n- The crepe is huge--3/4 the length of my entire arm huge--with a thin layer of chicken masala spread on it. It's served with sambar (a comforting chickpea soup spiced with tamarind) and chutneys (the cilantro-cucumber one was intriguing), as well as a small dish of tikka masala sauce (tomatoes, garlic, and Indian spices). Geez, that tikka masala sauce is bomb, so much so that I asked for a second serving (the server recommended it a bit warmed for more impactful flavor). Slurpity slurp slurp.\n- I can't quite figure out why the chicken in the dosa isn't as juicy as the chicken in the korma, since both use tandoori chicken. My guess is that the chicken in the korma is stewed in the cream sauce, which maintains moisture better.\n\n(PROBS SHOULD HAVE SOME) $3 GARLIC BASIL NAAN: baked bread with garlic and basil (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ#pi0Mr3dLe0k3kh52SDwP3w)\n- The naan here is thin crust pizza-esque rather than fluffy, which lends more of a crunch. Enjoyed the generous seasoning.\n\nMy recommendation: skip everything else on their menu and hone in on just the chicken korma.

Plus the crepe to filling ratio was off. I just didn't enjoy this dish at all.\n\nThe rest of the dishes were okay. Good and bad points to all. I guess my main complaint was flavor and spice. I liked the two vindaloos we had, but they both could have benefited from a little more spice.

Curry Village is decent, but I was hoping to see Masala Dosa really up the bar for Indian in the Inner Sunset.\n\nThe Good\n\nSadly, there are some major issues with the food. First the good, though. Excellent service. The waiter was super attentive but never overbearing, very helpful, there when I wanted him, not there when I didn't. That was great.\n\nThey cook carbs well. The rice was fluffy and wonderfully seasoned, and the onion naan was incredibly flavorful with a delicious wood-fire smell to it (although a touch on the dense side for naan). Maybe I should have got the dosas, since that's a carb and it's in the name of the place after all. But I didn't, I went with some my favorites.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe Bhindi Masala (okra) and Lamb Vindaloo I ordered were poorly done on two levels: (1) cooked unevenly/carelessly, and (2) poorly seasoned.\n\n(1) Some of the okra was underdone and really tough, other bits nice and tender. Similarly with the lamb, some pieces were dry and tough and others were quite moist. The only way you screw that up is by not paying attention in the kitchen, or by combining uncooked food with pre-cooked food in the same frying pan.\n\n(2) Both spice mixes fell flat. They were obviously not fresh spices, which in this day and age is really inexcusable. No Indian restaurant in San Francisco should be using pre-ground spices, they should be making their mixes from scratch every morning. The vindaloo in particular had a flavor of stale paprika that was really unpleasant. And it wasn't spicy in the least, which was quite disappointing.\n\nSo anyway, Curry Village still wins on flavor, even though they put too much sugar into their food and they're too pushy about the buffet.

The potatoes were well made, spicy, flavorful, and had just a hint of crispiness that gave a really nice flavor to the dish.  Both the sambhar and the coconut chutney were as good as any I've had (including Udipi Palace and Saravana Bhavan).  \n\nThe chicken tikka masala was also very good.  The sauce was creamy and flavorful, not overly peppery but still had appropriate amounts of heat.  The chicken pieces were chunks of breast meat, obviously of good quality, moist and tender, with no appreciable fat or gristle (a whole different world from the grade D swill they put in the CTM at Naan n Curry). \n\nAs for the atmosphere, the interior of the restaurant was nicely decorated.  I do agree that it was a bit dark, but I like that ambiance - it lends a romantic note which is rare at reasonably priced Indian restaurants.  \n\nAll in all, it was an excellent experience and we will be back...it's a short distance from UCSF where we both work.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-09-04"}, {"excerpts": ["All of the food has been good, but I'd recommend not missing out on the South Indian dishes, like the Paper Masala Dosa."], "author": "K.

But, the steep prices are validated: Masala Dosa is staged as a higher-end Indian restaurant than Curry Village or Naan N' Curry, so, adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\n(PASS ON THE) $6 EGGPLANT PAKORA: fresh eggplant dipped in chick pea batter and fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=DJUKjAUgUbAZnjxp6gxe-A#DJUKjAUgUbAZnjxp6gxe-A)\n- This dish ain't my piece o' cake. It's like the Indian version of tempura, except the chick pea batter isn't fried to a crisp, which leaves the pakora somewhat soggy. Add that to the flavorless nature of eggplant, and you're left with something mushily tasteless. Albeit, the mint chutney and sweet tamarind sauces are delicious and are meant to deliver a large component of flavor, but then I might as well just lap up those bowls of sauce. As if I don't already do that, haaaa. Shhhhhh.\n\n(OMG YOU BETTER GET THE) $13 CHICKEN KORMA: tandoori chicken cooked in a clay oven stewed in a cashew cream sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ#3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ)\n- Ridic delish. You should order this. And then, you should order this again. Yes, $13 is a bit of moolah for a dish that's usually less than $10, but just play some mind games and tell yourself it's $12.99 instead.\n- The bowl is small. Well, that's probably a mind game too. I bet it's actually the same size since the food is served in a normal bowl rather than those typical flat saucer dishes. Despite the small bowl, there's a heckuva lot of tandoori chicken chunks--I would say 8 or 9. And that beautifully moist chicken is what makes this dish addictive. This is most definitely the moistest chicken I've ever had in an Indian dish. And it doesn't help that the cashew cream sauce is liquid crack.\n\n(IF YOU WANNA, GET THE) $12 CHICKEN MASALA DOSA (dosas not available through online ordering): thin crepe with potatoes and chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=jYk3XRjZMohJGoKUUav3kg#T4Wfxp2FcovJNI19V75K7g)\n- The crepe is huge--3/4 the length of my entire arm huge--with a thin layer of chicken masala spread on it.

Geez, that tikka masala sauce is bomb, so much so that I asked for a second serving (the server recommended it a bit warmed for more impactful flavor). Slurpity slurp slurp.\n- I can't quite figure out why the chicken in the dosa isn't as juicy as the chicken in the korma, since both use tandoori chicken. My guess is that the chicken in the korma is stewed in the cream sauce, which maintains moisture better.\n\n(PROBS SHOULD HAVE SOME) $3 GARLIC BASIL NAAN: baked bread with garlic and basil (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/masala-dosa-san-francisco?select=3cMzA8dlGFoRpmONh_ymOQ#pi0Mr3dLe0k3kh52SDwP3w)\n- The naan here is thin crust pizza-esque rather than fluffy, which lends more of a crunch.
