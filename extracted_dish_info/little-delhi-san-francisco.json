Doing a little brainstorming with my brain and stomach somewhat internally communicating, I thought of Indian. I found Little Delhi to have the highest ratings in walking distance and went.\n\nThe restaurant is casual, rectangular and long shaped. When we dined here, it was way too warm inside, making it a little uncomfortable. I'm not sure how the workers run around in there. \n\nService here could be better - servers forget what you ask for, and it takes awhile for them to come to you or bring your requests to them. Other than that, the food here is really good.\n\nWe ordered Samosa, the Assorted Tandoori Platter (which came with fish, lamb, and chicken - all Tikka), Vegetable Korma, White Basmati Rice, and Naan. \n\nFirst off, I really liked the bread chips that they serve to you pre-meal. They looked like wheat chips with grains toasted into them and was accompanied by the green and red sauces, very nice since I usually don't get a pre-appetizer at Indian restaurants. The Samosas were okay - they're on the bigger side, which is fine, but also on the drier side. The Assorted Tandoori Platter was great, however, we still enjoyed the chicken the most - lamb and fish were great tasting but prepared Tikka style, chicken is the way to go. Basmati Rice and Naan were freshly made and very tasty. Lastly, I LOVED their Vegetable Korma - consistency/texture/and taste were perfect. Little Delhi's Korma is probably the best that I've tried.\n\nOverall, great Indian restaurant - on the pricier side, but food is good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-06-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Appetizers: I have taken the assorted tandoori platter, which was  huge and flavourful; my gf, on the other hand,  didn't particularly like her papri chaat (a random mix of garbanzo beans, chips, drowned in a mix of three sauces  ... really out of place if compared to the rest  of the menu).

They describe it as, \"Naan stuffed with raisins, cherries, and coconut.\" What you get is a red sludge coconut flavored mix. I don't mean to make that sound bad, it's actually very delicious. Not sure that they turn the Tandoor oven up high enough, the bread is a tad soft on this as well as the garlic Naan we order. The real reason I keep coming back here is for the Lamb Saagt.
