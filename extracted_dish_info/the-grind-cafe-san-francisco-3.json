And you had your breakup speech all planned out and maybe even rehearsed; you had chosen a coffeehouse or a park that you had never been to together so that neither of your memories or daily routines would be ruined by this ultimately trivial but nonetheless life-changing event?

Even today, with the influx of some new businesses further east on Haight St, the Grind is still one of the only places that is reliable for all your coffee, tea, and breakfast needs. \n\nAs a vegan, there is unfortunately not a whole lot of options at your disposal. However, you can find a tofu scramble, some hummus and bagel type offerings, as well as soy and almond milk on the menu. I believe they also occasionally have some vegan baked good selections, although I didn't see any last time I was there.\n\nAlthough the vegan options aren't stellar, it's about on par with most of the rest of the neighborhood (or even SF, for that matter.) But I personally really appreciate that they have a large selection of teas. For some reason, it's rather difficult to find hot tea offerings in the area. Most of the cafes in the neighborhood tend to be very coffee centric. The Grind carries Mighty Leaf and have all of your staple varieties (plus a little more.)\n\nFinally, the Grind is a place you actually want to hang out at and spend a little bit of your morning and afternoon. The staff is friendly and they have a good amount of seating both indoors and out.

I ordered the French Burger with fries and found it to be okay but nothing noteworthy.  The french fries were decent but I think it was a poor choice to order this variation of a hamburger as the addition of french bread makes for a heavier meal.  I couldn't finish the other half of my sandwich.\nMy friends who brought me here both days highly endorse the French Dip as being the best in the city.

This is a place that does all of them well, in a neighborhood where most people want them sometimes, and sometimes many people want them at the same time. The result is: not enough space during peak times. Just remember that all the tables close together, inside and out, are necessary. You'll appreciate them more if you have to wait. In general though, people don't dawdle too much after they've finished and it's really busy. \n\nJust so you know: Order at the register, go up your drinks from the counter, and eventually bus your table...*but* you'll have food brought to the table thanks to the little numbered sign. \n\nTheir breakfast burrito is big and darn good. Really enjoyed the omelette too. Good-sized portions for all plates, whether or not you're hung over. Good coffee and DIY water. OJ was fine. I've also had the jungle juice smoothie, which is a solid green but has a fruity-banana flavor - it's excellent. \n\nIf you need wireless, be warned that it can be slow with several users at once.
