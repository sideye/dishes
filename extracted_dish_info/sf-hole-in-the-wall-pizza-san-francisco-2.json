We placed a delivery order through DoorDash on Monday, September 10th at 5:53pm. It arrived at 6:47pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Traditional Wings: 1/2 lb, Buffalo ($8)\n*Mixed Greens: Lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and no black olives, Caesar ($8)\n*Pizza By The Slice ($3.25): Chicken Pesto ($0.75)\n*Combo Classic Pizza: Marinara, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, sweet green bell pepper, red onions and Italian sausage, Medium 14\" Pizzas ($27)\n\nThe roomie picked the combo pizza. It was a decent combination pizza. Good assortment of ingredients. I did like that the crust was on the thinner side, but it was still a touch too bready for me. Though it did have a nice chew. I adore pesto, so I'm glad they offer slices here. The chicken pesto slice was a good size and fulfilled my need for variety. The wings were okay. The buffalo sauce was too tangy, so we actually had the wings naked. I'm glad they came with celery as I adore my veggies. The roommate's kinda on a diet, so he wanted me to get a salad. This wasn't really a mixed green salad as it only came with romaine, but since we got caesar dressing, it was fine.\n\nAll right spot to grab some pizza. I am glad they offer slices, as I always want a tomato based and a pesto based pie. This way, I didn't have to order a whole new pizza.

My friend who lives in SF actually introduced me to the place a few years ago and I've been going back ever since. I usually go there at night and it's usually not busy. It's literally a hole in the wall. It is really small inside. It probably could only fit 10 people comfortably in their little dining/order area. They have a few bar seats inside but that's pretty much it. It's a good place to grab pizza and go. They have a lot on their menu but I've only tried a few of their pizzas and their garlic fries.

"], "author": "Donovan H.", "review": "We all live a fast paced lifestyle. And getting our food quick and on-the-go is key on many occasions. This takes us to the trendy Marina District in San Francisco where you will find \"SF Hole In The Wall Pizza\". Conveniently located on Scott St. and in between Chestnut and Lombard St's., this place has been feeding hungry patrons of every lifestyle since 2012.\n\nI actually stumbled on this place by accident and that was simply walking by (without using the Yelp app on my smartphone). Now that doesn't very often anymore! Reason being is that I needed a quick bite to eat while my lady was getting her hair and nails done. Not to mention, I had already chugged down a few beers at a local sports bar which gave me the munchies after consuming alcoholic beverages.\n\nNow keep in mind, this place literally is a hole-in-the-wall. There is no seating inside but it does offer a few tables and chairs outside. You mainly have to have the mindset that your food will be to-go. Going back to the interior layout of this place.. It is very small but there is enough room to view the menu; one of my gripes is how difficult the menu is to read. There is also a wide array of autographed pictures (which includes the late Robin Williams and others) on the left hand side. You can also see how the kitchen is in the rear of the building. With as tiny as this place is, I am almost thinking that this entire business is only about 400 square feet.\n\nOnto the food; their pizza selections are actually quite extensive. You will find your standard cheese, pepperoni, combination, and vegetarian. And several other creations such as the Margherita, Chicken Pesto, BBQ Chicken and the Pizza Aloha. If pizza isn't your thing, they also serve calzones, burgers, wings, fries, meatballs, sandwiches, and salads. And for refreshments, they have fountain drinks as well as bottled beer. I ended up ordering a slice of their \"Chicken Pesto\" which came to a little over $5.00.\n\nI do like how they put the pizza in a nice little box to fit their New York-styled slice. As far as the taste, I think it was just average at best. I had very little chicken on my pizza and the taste of the basil in the pesto was very subtle. It almost just tasted like a standard cheese slice. Fortunately I was able to dress it up by adding crushed red pepper but that didn't really do much. I suppose if you were extremely drunk, this would taste amazing. But even after drinking three beers, the pizza just wasn't all that.\n\nI do think a place like this will do just fine; simply because its in the heart of the Marina District and also because the shopping in this part of town is thriving. Not to mention, prices on their food is dirt cheap which is all the more reason to get filled up for just a few bucks. Overall, I don't think I will come back to \"SF Hole in the Wall Pizza\". But if you're a pizza lover, I would still consider checking this place out.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-01-30"}], "no hangover aloha pizza": [], "veggielicious pizza": [], "arugula pear pizza": [], "mozzarella and marinara pizza": [], "ham calzone": [{"excerpts": ["Ham calzone was delicious.
