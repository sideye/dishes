Not bad, just not worth me putting pen to paper over.\n\nWell, my usual 24th st. Philz has been going downhill lately. Ever Since Tony, the pourista left, the coffee just hasn't been the same. When I saw this new out of the way Philz pop up under \"Hot and New\" I figured I would jump in the car to check it out. \n\nThis Philz is located in an up and coming yuppieville area of the Dogpatch. It's located on the southern end of it that hasn't yet caught up. With that said, it's located in a brand new condo/loft complex, surrounded by nothing but industrial buildings. There's decent parking but not as much as I would've thought since most of the would be parking spaces are driveways.\n\nIt's a hot looking new space, as all the new Philz are. However there's something different about this one. It could be the Neon \"Philz University\" sign and bar located to the left of the main brew line. I assume this is where they train budding pouristas. There's even a snazzy glass conference room upstairs with a massive TV. I'm sure nobody has trouble staying awake during long training sessions here.\n\nI was joking with a coworker that maybe we would run into Tony here. Sure enough, when we walked in we were instantly greeted with his patented \"gentleman, what can I get you today?\". Holy shit! Phil must know Tony is his best pourista, so he brought him down to Philz U to train the n00bs. Smart use of Snoop's money, Phil. Very smart! \n\nHe brewed up a fantastic cup of coffee, Silken Splendor on this occasion. Steeped perfectly, aerated multiple times, double high poured, then filled to the brim in our own mugs which saves you a dollar by bringing your own.\n\nTheir pastry case was well stocked, although I hate their Starter bakery items, I was happy to see they had several varieties of Pepples Donuts.

We love you! We want to serve you coffee! Hang in there and we'll get everyone taken care of!\" or hoots and hollers that I can only suspect are caffeine-induced. Everyone here is happy and I can tell that Philz must take care of its employees.

The Philz HQ!!\n\nIt's tucked away in a kinda quiet industrial neighborhood, so you won't get any of the usual crazy hustle and bustle of SF. There's some outdoor seating, as well as tons of space inside!! The inside is SUPER HIP!! So nicely decorated, and it has a nice modern vibe!!\n\nMy go-to drink orders:\n- 1/2 yerba mate, 1/2 chamomile, iced, medium creamy with almond milk and light sweet with honey\n- Iced Philtered Soul, straight up\n\nIt is the headquarters, so they test out new food items here. They had the ricotta & pistachio toast, which isn't something you can find at all the locations that serve food (not all locations have toast/food selections other than what you see in the bakery display case)!! \n\nThe ricotta & pistachio toast was kinda missing something?? It was served on Starter Bakery bread and came with honey and sea salt, but it kinda lacked the flavor I was expecting?? It was tasty with a hint of sweet and salty that complemented each other nicely, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual: avocado toast with no egg\n\nThey had a creamy hazelnut toast on the menu, but I didn't see it in the display case, so I asked if they were still serving it, and the worker said they ran out of hazelnuts and that they stopped because it wasn't super popular :( I also saw a few energy bowl options!! Hella rad!!\n\nBottom line: Love this location!! The workers are super friendly, and there's tons of space if you're looking for a place to work.
