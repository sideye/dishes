I don't understand why this place has bad reviews?! Starbucks in general is great. Yes I get it, never a fan of the prices but the customer makes the experience whole. He was delightful like my latte! I got the ginger bread holiday spice flat white, non-fat, a huge fan already! \n\nHe was witty, energized, and accommodating. He suggested the original coffee cake and was out so I opted for the only option left- Cinnamon coffee cake. Which doesn't taste like coffee at all. He was so sweet enough to comp me for the inconvenience.\n\nOverall, service and drinks were great! Thumbs up", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-11-26"}]}
