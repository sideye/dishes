OMG this is a must get for rolls.  The seared butterfish was generous on top and melted in your mouth.  It is so worth it and beautifully presented.  \n\nLoco Spiderman Roll ($15)- This roll included spicy tuna, mango, deep fried soft shell crab, scallions, and topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce.  The roll had the deep fried crab inside of it but also two soft shell crabs that were deep fried also sat on top of the roll.  The presentation was really nice.

They were fantastic. \n\nScallop Nigiri ($8/2 pieces)-  These were so good we ended up ordering a whole bunch.  Each scallop piece was huge, sweet, fresh and delicious. \n\nLive Sweet Shrimp Nigiri (MP)- These were also oh so yummy.  It was served with the head fried.  For two shrimps it was quite the presentation.  \n\nWe were all very happy with our orders and left totally satisfied and full.  I thought pricing was cheap for what you get.

It's especially nice because it offers some \"higher end\" options while also having some good filler menu choices that won't break the bank. The fish quality here doesn't quite match up to the modern accessible-but-high-end vibe this place gives off but the rolls are creative, the service is excellent, and I just can't be too mad about $1 miyagi oysters.\n\nFor food my friend and I got oysters and a roll I can't remember the name of (it had escolar, pickled jalapenos, and a ponzu truffle sauce.) I got the nigiri combo and my friend got the It's Like Butter Baby w/ white rice versus the bacon fried rice.\n\nOyster quality is honestly pretty good for just a buck. Miyagi oysters are about as standard as an oyster can taste and my wallet is ok with that. The nigiri combo was a bit disappointing in terms of quality but for $25, it was almost a cheap basic omakase since it included less run-of-the-mill fish. I got: horse mackerel, Hawaiian amberjack, regular amberjack, salmon, yellowfin tuna, and ocean trout. The quality wasn't the best but for the price I didn't expect much. The taste wasn't clean and the texture was closer to mush. Not sure if I'd get it again.\n\nThe roll on the other hand was delicious. Escolar goes great with pickled items and I would definitely eat this again (if I could remember the name). My friend's Like Butter Baby dish was also good for the most part. The veggies really were drowned in butter laced with something else that's super addictive. The fish was cooked well but not all that fatty and honestly underseasoned. However, I know it's meant to be eaten with bacon fried rice. The white rice just makes the dish a bit too plain.\n\nOverall, I really do love this place.

Whether you're in the mood for sushi or something heavier / cooked, Nara's got you covered. The fish is very fresh so it's great as sashimi/nigiri or in their rolls, some of which are incredible. They always have daily specials listed on the board behind the sushi bar that oftentimes sell out.\n\nLast time I was here I had the seven-course omakase, which was an insane amount of food. There were lots of rolls, the kind that come with sauces or are deep fried or have fusion-y ingredients like cream cheese. They were delicious, but I was hoping for some really good simple fresh fish. Just when I thought that wasn't coming, a plate of I think seven types of sashimi was served, followed by seven types of nigiri. There was also salad, a course of cooked fish, miso soup with veggies and seafood, and creme brulee for dessert. I may have missed something else, but my point is it was all top-notch and a lot of food.\n\nFrom the regular menu some favorites include hamachi truffle, garlic butter edamame, chicken karaage (I prefer spicy), \"it's like butter\" (incredible fish dish), hamachi kama, big boss roll, and the ramen. Aside from the soups everything is easy to share, which makes coming here with friends even more fun.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome here, from the tasteful decor to the friendly and welcoming staff. I've gotten to know some of them, including chefs Kevin and Danny, both a lot of fun and great at what they do. George, one of the servers, is always attentive and friendly. And the owner Sonny, who you'll sometimes see wandering table to table, is an awesome guy who is doing things right with this restaurant.\n\nThere's an izakaya / gastropub vibe here, so even though the food is legit it's also a great place to grab drinks (though no liquor, so don't expect that). They have a few beers on tap and some imported bottles as well as an extensive sake menu. It can be a bit loud but never rowdy, which for me is perfect. They have good playlists to keep the atmosphere upbeat.\n\nIf you live nearby or are looking for a new sushi spot, definitely check this place out!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-07-21"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Omakase on a Saturday night, but we were not impressed...food wasn't that good.

Here is what I got :\n\nMr Tako Balls is a lot more carbs than a typical takoyaki, but then I realize it has truffle mash potato in it. It's not bad, but the carbiness that comes with potatoes can be tasted. \n\nHamachi truffle is the bomb dot com. Have it to start your night with the miyagi oysters and you won't be disappointed. I really like the ponzu they dress over the fish. \n\nThe miyagi oysters are $1 between 5-7 for happy hour  served with lemon and a soy sauce like sauce. Definitely indulge during he happy hours.

It was okay though taste wise, I've had better scallops at other places.\n\nAnkimo nigiri - I had it at Omakase and that's very hard to beat. The ankimo was a little cold and I prefer it warm. Would I pay $8, probably not.\n\nLoco Spider-Man roll was the only roll I got. I see that ppl also get the blazing glory. I would say loco Spider-Man is their take on spider roll. It's different because there is no eel. Rate is a 7/10.  Probably wouldn't get this again. Nothing was special about it. \n\nI give it a 5 for great experience, great food, great pricing, and  happy hour menu. The food is fresh and   I left a happy women. Great for groups. Clean.

This place was quite the opposite, little rice to lots of \"stuffing\" lol. The handroll was by far my favorite, again not much rice and a lot of fish. If you're new to sushi, this is what you strive for sushi places to have. There are three handrolls to the order (1 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 1 salmon).

However I did order $1.50 oysters off of it, but probably not worth it.  They tasted whatevers and were teeny tiny.  Everything off their regular menu though was amazing.  We got the following:\n\nSpecial \"K\" ($18)- This delicious and amazing roll included yellowtail, avocado, picked jalape\u00f1os, topped with amazing seared butterfish and truffle ponzu sauce.  OMG this is a must get for rolls.  The seared butterfish was generous on top and melted in your mouth.  It is so worth it and beautifully presented.  \n\nLoco Spiderman Roll ($15)- This roll included spicy tuna, mango, deep fried soft shell crab, scallions, and topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce.  The roll had the deep fried crab inside of it but also two soft shell crabs that were deep fried also sat on top of the roll.  The presentation was really nice.  It was also well worth the money and definitely delicious. \n\n10pc Sushi Omakase ($35)- I don't share so this was all for me.

The beautiful presentation came out on a long wooden slate of wood.  I got 10 different pieces of nigiri.  All of my sushi pieces were super fresh in quality and all huge pieces of fish.  I recommend this if you are new to this place.  I was really glad I got it.  \n\nHandroll tasting ($15)- This tasting included tuna belly, albacore belly, and salmon belly.  If you want handrolls then this is great for the value.  They were generous with the fish and all packed.  They were fantastic. \n\nScallop Nigiri ($8/2 pieces)-  These were so good we ended up ordering a whole bunch.  Each scallop piece was huge, sweet, fresh and delicious. \n\nLive Sweet Shrimp Nigiri (MP)- These were also oh so yummy.  It was served with the head fried.  For two shrimps it was quite the presentation.  \n\nWe were all very happy with our orders and left totally satisfied and full.  I thought pricing was cheap for what you get.  All the fish quality was A+.  The customer service was excellent.  They were awesome about substitution or any alterations.  The inside is kinda small but a very cute intimate vibe.

Loved the oysters though! My first time having just lemon juice, tobasco, and ponzu on my oysters. They tasted super clean, and not gritty or dirty. \n\nOther cold and hot plates we tried:\n\n1) Spicy pork buns : good, but was expecting more in taste, pork was a little dry. \n\n2) Hamachi truffle : A MUST TRY! 5 pieces of hamachi served in fantastic presentation. Hint of truffle, cilantro, and jalopenos. Loved it. Probably the best thing I had at Nara's. \n\n3) Hand roll sampler: good choice if you want to try otoro, sake toro, and toro hand rolls for a fairly decent price. Although they were good - I was not impressed in taste or anything. I probably have had too many hand rolls before to think these were amazing or anything. IMO it was lacking the extras like cucumber, scallions or cilantro, and even sauce. A little ponzu wouldn't have hurt. \n\n4) Ray Ray Tako's: meh. It was my least favorite. Basically just cooked octopus with some sweet sauce, some baby tomatoes and radish. Nothing spectacular.\n\n5) also had the edamame which I ordered with spicy butter and garlic butter. It was awesomeeee, wished it was more spicer, but I am a huge lover of garlic, probably the second best thing I had there. \n\nDef a nice sushi restaurant though, I'm glad I dined here!

I came around 6:30 on a weekday and it's definitely not crowded at that time. The restaurant had the daily specials written on the wall which is great. I would highly recommend the bar if your can. You really do see the chefs perfect every dish they make, even Togo boxes dishes. Here is what I got :\n\nMr Tako Balls is a lot more carbs than a typical takoyaki, but then I realize it has truffle mash potato in it. It's not bad, but the carbiness that comes with potatoes can be tasted. \n\nHamachi truffle is the bomb dot com. Have it to start your night with the miyagi oysters and you won't be disappointed. I really like the ponzu they dress over the fish. \n\nThe miyagi oysters are $1 between 5-7 for happy hour  served with lemon and a soy sauce like sauce. Definitely indulge during he happy hours. Surprisingly they are super clean, didn't taste muddy at all. I'm really happy with what they gave me. I will say that the soy sauce does not mix well with the lemon and hot sauce. I would choose one when mixing. \n\nNigiri tasting has 7 fish that the chefs get to choose  I got: hamachi, salmon, golden eye snapper, ocean trout, striped mackerel, yellowtail belly, escolar. Not bad! I can't say that the salmon was super buttery, but you can tell you are getting fresh clean fish. It cost $25 for 7 pieces. Not bad to try if you do not know what fish is good here. \n\nDaily special: live scallop special. Comes with 2 sashimi, 2 nigiri, and 2 tempura pieces. Presentation is on point. It was okay though taste wise, I've had better scallops at other places.\n\nAnkimo nigiri - I had it at Omakase and that's very hard to beat. The ankimo was a little cold and I prefer it warm. Would I pay $8, probably not.\n\nLoco Spider-Man roll was the only roll I got. I see that ppl also get the blazing glory. I would say loco Spider-Man is their take on spider roll. It's different because there is no eel. Rate is a 7/10.  Probably wouldn't get this again. Nothing was special about it. \n\nI give it a 5 for great experience, great food, great pricing, and  happy hour menu. The food is fresh and   I left a happy women. Great for groups. Clean.

It was only slightly fried which added a sense of crispiness outside of the eggplant.\n\nHamachi Truffle: A-.\nVery nicely presented. Strong truffle taste. Even though this is kind of a carpaccio dish but I could still taste the hamachi freshness. \n\nNigiri Tasting: A.\nThis was a total surprise. I wouldn't have expected such fresh fish in a sake bar restaurant! There were 7pcs, and although the waitress did present what each of those fish was it was too loud that I could hardly hear. All I know is that it was really fresh. This made me believe that the place was actually created with a traditional + hipster fusion Japanese restaurant theme. Order this.

The ikura makes this roll.\n\nBelow this - would not get again: \n\n5) Spicy tonkotsu ramen: it's not entirely fair to compare this to ramen-only shops, but this was a real miss. The spiciness overpowered the broth so you couldn't taste the pork flavor. Noodles were stuck together, e.g. what happens when you cook pasta and leave it out to dry w/ no oil. The yolk in the egg seemed al dente but somewhere along the way it fell out of the egg white and was never found again...so can't really comment on that one. \n\n6) Spicy handroll tasting: you get one of each spicy tuna, hamachi and sake.

The food is excellent and the owner/staff kick so much ass, Nara is always a fun place to be. It's a great place for a meal or a few rounds with good food for accompaniment, and the happy hour is great. \n\nMore detailed review:\n\nFirst things first, the food is excellent. Whether you're in the mood for sushi or something heavier / cooked, Nara's got you covered. The fish is very fresh so it's great as sashimi/nigiri or in their rolls, some of which are incredible. They always have daily specials listed on the board behind the sushi bar that oftentimes sell out.\n\nLast time I was here I had the seven-course omakase, which was an insane amount of food. There were lots of rolls, the kind that come with sauces or are deep fried or have fusion-y ingredients like cream cheese. They were delicious, but I was hoping for some really good simple fresh fish. Just when I thought that wasn't coming, a plate of I think seven types of sashimi was served, followed by seven types of nigiri. There was also salad, a course of cooked fish, miso soup with veggies and seafood, and creme brulee for dessert. I may have missed something else, but my point is it was all top-notch and a lot of food.\n\nFrom the regular menu some favorites include hamachi truffle, garlic butter edamame, chicken karaage (I prefer spicy), \"it's like butter\" (incredible fish dish), hamachi kama, big boss roll, and the ramen. Aside from the soups everything is easy to share, which makes coming here with friends even more fun.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome here, from the tasteful decor to the friendly and welcoming staff. I've gotten to know some of them, including chefs Kevin and Danny, both a lot of fun and great at what they do. George, one of the servers, is always attentive and friendly. And the owner Sonny, who you'll sometimes see wandering table to table, is an awesome guy who is doing things right with this restaurant.\n\nThere's an izakaya / gastropub vibe here, so even though the food is legit it's also a great place to grab drinks (though no liquor, so don't expect that).

We came in around 9pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty of people in the restaurant but we didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was a lot of fun, when we first sat down I wanna say he was doing Sake bombs with the table next to us lol. They have beer and wine (no liquor) which is great although they didn't have a single light beer on the menu, I would suggest adding Kirin Light or even something like Bud Light to the drink menu. Anyway the server was very helpful with deciding what to order, although he sort of guided us to order less than we probably would have because he said it was a lot of food, which it wasn't really, but it ended up being just about enough since we were going out drinking anyway and I was glad to not feel super full all night.

You really do see the chefs perfect every dish they make, even Togo boxes dishes. Here is what I got :\n\nMr Tako Balls is a lot more carbs than a typical takoyaki, but then I realize it has truffle mash potato in it. It's not bad, but the carbiness that comes with potatoes can be tasted. \n\nHamachi truffle is the bomb dot com. Have it to start your night with the miyagi oysters and you won't be disappointed. I really like the ponzu they dress over the fish. \n\nThe miyagi oysters are $1 between 5-7 for happy hour  served with lemon and a soy sauce like sauce. Definitely indulge during he happy hours. Surprisingly they are super clean, didn't taste muddy at all. I'm really happy with what they gave me. I will say that the soy sauce does not mix well with the lemon and hot sauce. I would choose one when mixing. \n\nNigiri tasting has 7 fish that the chefs get to choose  I got: hamachi, salmon, golden eye snapper, ocean trout, striped mackerel, yellowtail belly, escolar. Not bad! I can't say that the salmon was super buttery, but you can tell you are getting fresh clean fish. It cost $25 for 7 pieces. Not bad to try if you do not know what fish is good here. \n\nDaily special: live scallop special. Comes with 2 sashimi, 2 nigiri, and 2 tempura pieces. Presentation is on point. It was okay though taste wise, I've had better scallops at other places.\n\nAnkimo nigiri - I had it at Omakase and that's very hard to beat. The ankimo was a little cold and I prefer it warm. Would I pay $8, probably not.\n\nLoco Spider-Man roll was the only roll I got. I see that ppl also get the blazing glory. I would say loco Spider-Man is their take on spider roll. It's different because there is no eel. Rate is a 7/10.  Probably wouldn't get this again.

I don't understand how the seasoning can be this off. I think it could be that they marinate their fish such as sake and ika in salt, but the over-saltiness wasn't just in the fish. The main problem was the seasoning in their rice. It almost tasted like someone accidentally poured a bucket of salt in the rice or something.\n\nThe second problem was that all the ingredients were NOT FRESH. Their uni was probably the worst uni I've put in my mouth, it had such weird flavor and bitter taste. It takes a lot for an uni fanatic like me to leave a piece of uni nigiri on the table. It was that bad! Not to mention all of their other fish were meh. They really didn't taste fresh at all.\n\nThe third problem was that the flavors were quite off in the rolls. It could be the over-seasoning of the rice, stale ingredients, their sauces, or the combination of everything, but I just couldn't eat all of them even though I was at the restaurant with a huge craving of sushi and appetite.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, the Korean staff are nice and the atmosphere is quite nice, too.

I thought the interior was nice even from the outside. Inside its dark, wooden tables which create a rustic vibe, but the rest of the restaurant looks modern, Very neat and spaced out. Another thing I noticed was the music that was playing. For me, it really set the scene for a great dinner. The playlist was creative and entertaining. Now I'm a fan of hip hop, rnb, edm... And it was a mixture of all, and appropriate of course. It's something different and the choice of music was great because it doesn't always work when you have an employee picking the playlist. \n\nAnyways as for the food, we had a couple rolls and appetizers. The wait wasn't long at all and the waitress was helpful. The rolls we tried were...\n\n*Heart Attack - a lot of finesse on this dish. The tuna looked fresh, no doubting the quality. The garnish was impressive, and the roll was delicious. \n\n*Loco Spider Roll - Huge, I'm always a fan of multiple fish assortments in a roll. Soft shell crab was crispy, almost like getting a appetizer on top of the roll. \n\n*Treasure Roll - Deep fried and cream cheese is always a killer combo. They used real crab meat on which I appreciate instead of imitation. And the fresh tuna packed inside for the perfect size roll. \n\nFood now isn't just all about taste, it's also about presentation. People say you eat with your eyes, and eating here, I wasn't sure if it was my eyes or my stomach that was more satisfied. I feel like the chefs here understand how complex the elements of food. It's an Art, it's takes finesse, but it's also a science and understanding what works well together. It's very hard to paint a picture on a plate and even harder to make it taste good at the same time. It's very easy to mess that up. Complements to the chefs here because they got it done. I was also able to speak to the one  managers and he was very genuine and he appreciated our feedback. As for the whole dinning experience as a whole, it was a perfect night.

I don't understand how the seasoning can be this off. I think it could be that they marinate their fish such as sake and ika in salt, but the over-saltiness wasn't just in the fish. The main problem was the seasoning in their rice. It almost tasted like someone accidentally poured a bucket of salt in the rice or something.\n\nThe second problem was that all the ingredients were NOT FRESH. Their uni was probably the worst uni I've put in my mouth, it had such weird flavor and bitter taste. It takes a lot for an uni fanatic like me to leave a piece of uni nigiri on the table. It was that bad! Not to mention all of their other fish were meh. They really didn't taste fresh at all.\n\nThe third problem was that the flavors were quite off in the rolls.

People say you eat with your eyes, and eating here, I wasn't sure if it was my eyes or my stomach that was more satisfied. I feel like the chefs here understand how complex the elements of food. It's an Art, it's takes finesse, but it's also a science and understanding what works well together. It's very hard to paint a picture on a plate and even harder to make it taste good at the same time. It's very easy to mess that up. Complements to the chefs here because they got it done. I was also able to speak to the one  managers and he was very genuine and he appreciated our feedback. As for the whole dinning experience as a whole, it was a perfect night.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of fish - one of my favorites is the Big Boss Roll which mixes yellowtail, tuna, and salmon that is then paired with sprouts, avocado and cucumber. If you want something heartier, their ramen is decent and they also offer an array of specials, from wagyu steak to hamachi kama.

"], "author": "Sunjoo K.", "review": "One of my favorite sushi places in town!\nI am picky when it comes to sushi. I am not one of those who gets a bento box when going to a Japanese place although I have nothing against bento boxes. I grew up in Aisa where Japanese food is everywhere, easily better than places in the U.S, and are a lot more affordable so it takes a lot for me to give five stars. \n\nLet's talk about customer service. Every single staff at Nara including the servers and chefs were friendly and welcoming. Also they were very knowledgable about their specials and the menu. I mean what more can I ask?\n\nExcellent food. The quality of the fish Nara serves is not something you find in any Japanese restaurants. They are super fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed their uni, striped horse mackerel, premium Japanese snapper, golden eye snapper, and Hawaiian amberjack. Also these are not typical fish you find anywhere. I highly recommend Nara if you want to try something unique and different. Also I'm not a huge fan of rolls because rolls tend to overshadow the taste of the fish with sauce and other ingredients. However Nara's rolls are amazing and super tasty and don't overshadow the fish. Some of my favorites are Big boss, heartattack, and special K. \n\nDaily specials. Every day from 5-7 they have a happy hour deal where draft beer and hot Sake are $1 off and they have one dollar oysters. If you are an oyster lover like myself, you def should check this place out. \n\nOverall I have amazing time every time i visit Nara.

"], "author": "Joseph N.", "review": "This is hands down my favorite spot in the neighborhood and one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is excellent and the owner/staff kick so much ass, Nara is always a fun place to be. It's a great place for a meal or a few rounds with good food for accompaniment, and the happy hour is great. \n\nMore detailed review:\n\nFirst things first, the food is excellent. Whether you're in the mood for sushi or something heavier / cooked, Nara's got you covered. The fish is very fresh so it's great as sashimi/nigiri or in their rolls, some of which are incredible. They always have daily specials listed on the board behind the sushi bar that oftentimes sell out.\n\nLast time I was here I had the seven-course omakase, which was an insane amount of food. There were lots of rolls, the kind that come with sauces or are deep fried or have fusion-y ingredients like cream cheese. They were delicious, but I was hoping for some really good simple fresh fish. Just when I thought that wasn't coming, a plate of I think seven types of sashimi was served, followed by seven types of nigiri. There was also salad, a course of cooked fish, miso soup with veggies and seafood, and creme brulee for dessert. I may have missed something else, but my point is it was all top-notch and a lot of food.\n\nFrom the regular menu some favorites include hamachi truffle, garlic butter edamame, chicken karaage (I prefer spicy), \"it's like butter\" (incredible fish dish), hamachi kama, big boss roll, and the ramen. Aside from the soups everything is easy to share, which makes coming here with friends even more fun.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome here, from the tasteful decor to the friendly and welcoming staff. I've gotten to know some of them, including chefs Kevin and Danny, both a lot of fun and great at what they do. George, one of the servers, is always attentive and friendly. And the owner Sonny, who you'll sometimes see wandering table to table, is an awesome guy who is doing things right with this restaurant.\n\nThere's an izakaya / gastropub vibe here, so even though the food is legit it's also a great place to grab drinks (though no liquor, so don't expect that). They have a few beers on tap and some imported bottles as well as an extensive sake menu. It can be a bit loud but never rowdy, which for me is perfect. They have good playlists to keep the atmosphere upbeat.\n\nIf you live nearby or are looking for a new sushi spot, definitely check this place out!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-07-21"}, {"excerpts": ["Big Boss - big boss...\n\n"], "author": "Candace D.", "review": "HOLY COW!

Immediately walked in and got a huge welcome from all the staff. Came in with a group of 3 with reservations at 8. Not many people around this time on a Friday night but got pretty packed around 9. Prices not too bad. \n\nThings we got:\n-Hamachi truffle appetizer was amazing. Was extremely happy with every spoonful.\n-Desperaso with butter fish was not worth it. 4 pieces and lots of decorative additions but took away from the fish.\n-Half dozen oysters for $11. Extremely refreshing. \n-Chicken karage was pretty great. Comes in spicy version and not spicy. We got the non-spicy which comes with a ranch like sauce and a spicy mayo. Saw the spicy version at the table next to us and it looked pretty good.\n-Vegetable tempura was light but literally one piece of each vegetable listed from the menu.\n-we ordered three rolls: Sake bomb, heart attack, and big boss. If you're a fish lover, the big boss is for you. Rolls were pretty tiny and not that impressive. \n\nOverall: rolls weren't really worth it. Will try the Nigri instead. Awesome music but it was really loud and I had to yell over the music and other customers to have a conversation.

It's actually quite funny and welcoming.  But you do immediately notice the noise level of the place is quite high.\n\nThe music is an issue by itself.  For one, it's blasted continuously.  Very difficult to have a conversation imo.  Plus, the music choices at times make it seem like you are sitting in a bad karaoke bar. Not to mention, when it's time to celebrate someone's birthday, regular music will stop, and music taken from what seems to be from a japanese game show/variety show/ Kpop is taken up a few decibels and floods the entire place for a good 1-2 minutes, until the staff is done wishing the patron a happy birthday. It's quite jarring.\n\nThe staff is quite nice, welcoming, and attentive for the most part. Definitely a plus.\n\nThey have a nice selection of sake. Their drink menu is nicely done and even has an informative page at the end, describing each type of sake and the tastes you should expect to help make your choice. I'm not one to usually order sake, since I never know what to get, but I found myself ordering a small bottle due to the information they give you.  Nice touch.\n\nThe sushi itself is not very good imo.  I ordered both their nigiri and their sashimi tastings while my girlfriend ordered two of their rolls. The selection of novelty rolls themselves is very small compared to a typical sushi restaurant/bar.  That is perfectly fine, but the sushi you offer should be really good, unfortunately I don't believe it is. The two rolls we ordered were the 'Big Boss' and the Jessica Alba.  Yay for alba, nay for big boss. Shame, I love me some Metal Gear Solid.\n\nThe nigiri wasn't bad, just not great.  None of them seemed to be exceptionally fresh.   The sashimi also suffers from this and the portion size also seemed off.  The cuts were rather large and thick, which may seem like a good thing, but having a larger piece of fish with lower quality taste isn't really that appetizing. I also felt that some of the pieces of both sashimi/nigiri were over seasoned as well.\n\nIt's a decent place.  If you live in a different neighborhood, I don't think its worth the effort to come out, better going off to Ricky Bobby a few blocks down.
