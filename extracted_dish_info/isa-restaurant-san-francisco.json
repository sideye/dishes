The plus side is that they have happy hour until 7pm, so we got dollar oysters and $5 soju/wines to start off. Drinks are not too strong, but tasty and oysters were standard. The restaurant enters a dim-lit dining area as you're taken through the back. It's a covered outdoor backyard with strings of lights and heated lamps. There's plants hanging all around to give a cozy and romantic ambiance with an outdoor feel. I was head over heels with their d\u00e9cor of the restaurant. To add, we were treated with a warm and chirpy welcome from the server telling us that they have been waiting 15 years for our arrival. What a silly guy.\n\nAlthough complimentary bread was offered, we were also warned to not stuff ourselves since we had a lot of food coming our way. The 4-course restaurant week started off with a Smooth Potato Leek Soup and Arugula Salad. Both were decent, but the salad lacked some flavor. Second course was the Yellowfin Tuna and Organic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio. As a huge fan of raw fish, I loved both of these dishes. The only problem was that I was not too hungry coming in for dinner, so we were both pretty stuffed by this point.\n\nThe main course was the Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast and Grilled Golden Gate Natural Flat Iron Steak. Both of them came with a side of greens: steak with zucchini and potatoes/duck with spinach and beets. Both dishes were very solid and tasty, but I think I was way too stuffed to enjoy any more of it. Thankfully we decided to boxed these up and move onto our dessert. We finished with the Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee and Buche Au Lait De Crevre Aged Goat Cheese. The date loved the goat cheese while I indulged myself in the cr\u00e8me brulee. Very smooth, sweet and a very crystallized top layer --yum!\n\nWhat I loved most was the variety of choices for each course. Although the food was not out of this world, it was still pleasurable.

Even though I was the only one who ordered this, the flavoring was simply on point, with a nice creamy consistency and balanced flavoring.\n\nEvery single dish offered in the second course was satisfactory, but my personal favorite had to be the goat cheese. I know people will be turned off by the strong flavor of it, but it actually appealed well to my tastes. The salmon and tuna were alright, and the mussels were too small (or in some cases, nonexistent)\n\nFoie gras melted in my mouth upon first contact, and considering it was my first time trying it, I liked that feeling!  The angus flat iron steak were nice but didn't stand out too much. \n\nFinally, the semifreddo (which had the consistency of ice cream, not gelato as the waiter mentioned), was DELICIOUS.

Pretty good deal.\n\nFirst courses:\n\nOrganic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio - Pretty yummy for a starter.  You get four pieces of crostini and 6 thin slices of salmon with all the goodies on top.  The salmon was pretty fresh.  The toppings went well with the salmon and crostini.  If there was a hint of lime, I think it would of tasted much more refresh, but nonetheless, it was still pretty delicious.\n\nSteam Prince Edward Mussels - Yum!  The white wine sauce was so tasty that my friend even use the spoon and drank it.  The mussels tasted pretty fresh and it had the right amount of seasoning.  This dish comes with two pieces of grilled bread and it goes very well with the sauce.\n\nSecond Courses:\n\nTruffle Risotto - Yummy!  Cooked to perfection.  The flavors on this dish is just perfect and the texture was good.  The truffle didn't over power any taste on this dish.  We were able to take the wine, mushrooms, and truffle flavors at the same time.  Perfect amount of mushrooms with this dish too.  Yum.\n\nSpaghetti - This is a dish I didn't really care for.  The spaghetti is not as saucy as I liked it and it tasted like it was drenched in butter.  For spaghetti, I like more of a tomato-ey taste, but this dish just taste like it had too much butter.\n\nDessert:\n\nBuche Au Luit De Chevre - Light and fluffy is how I can explain this dessert.  It wasn't overly sweet with the taste of hazelnut.  Yummy!\n\nGrapefruit Granite - They said this is like a grapefruit sorbet, but to me its more like a grapefruit shave ice.  Nice way to end the meal. \n\nThe overall experience here was great.  The service was great as well.  Our empty dishes were cleared out pretty quickly and our waters were always filled.

Order this!\n- Grilled local calamari - not my cup of tea, but my friends were practically fighting over the last pieces.\n- Simply saute\u00e9d Sea of cortez wild prawns - simple but extraordinary. the lemon, garlicky butter is like having a bite of heaven. \n- Hudson valley grade A foie gras - still haven't mustered up the stomach for it, but it smells awesome, and everyone melted down their chairs when they bit into this.\n- Potato wrapped Seabass - AWESOME. that's it.\n- Truffle risotto - soooo creamy!!! i loved it!!! \n- Roasted rack of lamb - don't touch the stuff, but the friends that did eat it lOOOOOVed it. said it wasn't gamey (which makes me not like it) and it was roasted to perfection.\n- Maple leaf farm duck breast - still can't go wrong with this mother.\n- Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak - buttery meatiness.\n- Brussels Sprouts with garlic, bacon & extra virgin olive oil - mm.. not buttery enough, but they were cooked to tenderness. \n\n\n$57 per person for all that food and 3 bottles of wine, plus endless amount of cocktails, and 2 desserts, that ain't bad at ALL!

Not only did they offer four courses, but their dishes actually had variety and were worth trying, unlike many of the other contenders churning out a cookie cutter 3-course menu of soup or salad, boring entree, and brownie dessert. The portions were a good size, just a touch smaller than their usual portions. I'll include the current prices.\nWe were seated in the covered patio area behind the restaurant, which was probably a backyard in the past. Even though it was cold outside, the heating lamps and covered awning provided enough warmth and shelter. It felt cozy and inviting.\n\n$10 Maine Lobster Broth w/ prawns, tomato, celery & tarragon:\nHot & savory bowl that warmed me up from the first taste. There were just a couple pieces of lobster & prawn, but they were good-sized chunks. The broth was smooth and satisfying.\n\n$15 Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori & *low sodium soy:\nCubes of tuna served tartare style over creamy chunks of avocado, with seaweed salad. It was very good, but I wouldn't normally order this at a French restaurant.\n\n$16 Dungeness Crab Salad w/ avocado, apples, grapefruit & tarragon:\nThe shredded crab was not too shredded and the pieces were still substantial enough to be satisfying. The avocado, apple slices, and grapefruit each added variations in texture, and some tart and sweet flavors to the mix.\n\n$24 Seared Scallops w/ mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon & truffle sauce:\nScallops were seared just right with a browned surface, but still had a meaty and springy texture. Brussel sprouts were roasted to a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were so good with the savory sauce.\n\n$23 Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce:\nThe slices of flat iron were juicy and tender. The sauce on top was like a chimichurri, good flavor, but could have used more of it.\n\n$7 Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: \nCreme brulee isn't my favorite dessert. I still do enjoy taking a spoon and giving the torched caramelized crust a whack and seeing the broken window effect. Surprisingly it didn't break, as it was a rather thick crust. The custard underneath was nice and smooth.\n\n$7 Semifreddo all' Amaretto:\nI didn't know what to make of this semifreddo. I've had semifreddos before, but this seemed like half ice cream and half frozen bread. At least that was the texture that came to my mind. The almond cookies were good. I don't care for presentation or garnishes, but in this case, the sprig of mint was much needed to make this dish look good.\n\nNow that I think about it, I probably would enjoy the grapefruit granite. I wonder why I never tried it. \n\nThe chef has quite an impressive resume. I can see how he's going for a Californian Provencal menu, but most of the dishes seem more Californian to me.\nWould I eat here again? Since I've tried the above dishes, there's not much on the prix fix menu that intrigues me, except maybe the salmon carpaccio or the truffle risotto. I am interested in trying the foie gras though.

The restaurant is larger than it seems and has a beautiful, sheltered and heated patio at the back. The waiters are warm and courteous, and the food was delicious!\n\nWe ordered the Salmon Carpaccio and the Maine Lobster Broth for our appetizers. My boyfriend absolutely raved about the Lobster Broth and said that he would come to Isa for that alone, while I enjoyed the Salmon Carpaccio as well. The salmon had a hint of lemon, was very fresh, and the textures were amazing. We would order both again. Unfortunately, they were out of the Dungeness Crab Salad when we went, but we are definitely going to try that next time.\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the Truffle Risotto while my boyfriend ordered the Flat Iron Steak. The Truffle Risotto was amazing. The texture of the risotto was just right, and the mushrooms were delectable. It reminded me very much of Lupa Trattoria's Fettuccine Tartufate, which is just about my absolute favorite pasta dish that I've had in all my 25 years of life (but that's a review for another time). The Flat Iron Steak was also very delicious, and reminded me of the steak frites from Le Relais de l'Entrec\u00f4te in Paris since the moutarde verte that they topped the steak with is very similar to the ones from Le Relais. You can also choose other side dishes to come with the steak, but I highly recommend sticking to the moutarde verte. You can't go wrong! \n\nFor dessert I ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake. This is probably my one disappointment, but only because I was expecting a very dense chocolate cake like the ones they serve at The House (which is mindblowingly amazing). I could tell that the cake was straight out of the oven though as it was piping hot and incredibly fresh. It was a more spongy cake than I would have liked, but it was served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and I enjoyed myself despite my expectations.\n\nOverall, this restaurant just shot up to one of my top 5 places to eat in San Francisco, and I have lived here for 4 years now.

It felt like something you could make at home like a prepackaged meal from a supermarket. The braised short ribs weren't bad though. The meat was tender and pretty flavorful.\n\nLastly, for desserts, we had the semifreddo all' amaretto and a vanilla bean creme brulee.

They wouldn't allow for both.  I was a little stunned that they came and asked us.  To me, it was poor etiquette.  They even went as far as telling us that they would have to pay OpenTable if we got the 1000 pts so that was the reason why they wouldn't let us order off their prix-fixe menu.  Geez, talk about shady!  Since we didn't want to be restricted on the menu items, we opted for the 1000 pts instead.  Minus one star for this awkwardness.  \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful in giving us suggestions.  He reminded us that the dishes were meant to be shared.  For starters, we had the Yellowfin Tuna and Dungeness Crab Salad.  The tuna tasted like poke with chunks of tuna vs minced tuna like tartare.  I highly recommend the crab salad as it was very light and refreshing with the avocado, apple, and grapefruit.  \n\nFor the entrees, we tried their popular dish, Potato Wrapped Seabass as well as their Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast.  The fish was nicely cooked (not dried out) considering the fact that the outside had crispy potato chips.  The sauce had capers and was very flavorful with the tomato confit.  The duck was very juicy, also cooked medium rare, and I loved the sweet sauce that it came with.  Both dishes were EXCELLENT!\n\nWe ended the meal with a creme brulee.

It didn't taste irony, which is good, but it was soooo soft and mushy.  Paired with the brioche and it was just soft and more softness.  I needed some texture.\n\nFor entrees, we had the duck breast and the flat iron steak.  The duck was alright, but it would've been better if the skin was crispy.  The sauce wasn't very spectacular.  We waited for a long time for the flat iron steak to come out.  They started clearing our table to get ready for dessert and that's when we said we haven't gotten the steak yet.  Turns out, they accidentally had given it to the guy next to us, even though he had eaten his entree already.  So, finally the steak comes out.  But there's mustard on it.  And we had asked for no mustard.  So we just didn't eat it.\n\nFor dessert, we chose the semifreddo and the vanilla gelato.  Again, no other word to describe them besides \"good.\"  \n\nYeah, it was a good deal for a 3 course French restaurant, but I'd much rather have that money spent somewhere else because the food was just not memorable.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-07-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Dungeness Crab Salad is so fresh and yummy!

For DAT, this restaurant is a good place to go.\n\nSERVICE (1/5)\nNow on to the review for one of the busiest times at Isa-- DAT week.  Perhaps it was an off day, but my DAT service experience at Isa wasn't very good and well below the standards of any successful, conscientious business establishment in the Bay Area.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the flat iron steak as our main course. The downside about this review is that because the restaurant was so busy during DAT, the clean up of our table was terrible.  Imagine tossing our silverware onto our plates and then SPLASHING steaks of red wine sauce all over my DRESS and my bf's DRESS SHIRT. Now that's really disappointing and totally unnecessary. In the wait staff's haste, they were negligent and careless, causing us an inconvenient trip to the dry cleaners and an uneasy feeling during the dinner.\n\nTo top it off, the waiter dropped glassware underneath on the floor next to our table and shards of glass scattered all over the floor, directly underneath our feet and onto my legs and my bf's dress pants and shoes. Sure, mistakes happen. But when you don't come back to clean up the mess after 10 minutes, then it's shame on you. Leaving broken glass underneath our feet made for a very uncomfortable and stressful dining experience. There was no apologies and even our neighbors shook their heads in disbelief (after pointing out the stains on my boyfriend's shirt in shock (yes, we have witnesses!)). \n\nIsa also ran out of its flourless chocolate cake, which is very unfortunate.  I'm a firm believer that successful restaurants should not run out of popular food items on a Saturday evening (one of the busiest days of the week for restaurants!). To top if off, I had asked our waiter beforehand if the flourless chocolate cakes would be available, as we were celebrating two of my friends' birthdays and I was sure that these cakes were going to be ordered. Our waiter said, \"Of course they will be available! This is Isa!  We will have everything on the menu.\" Imagine our great disappointment when the owner (Semera) said that they ran out. Very, very disappointing. \n\nI am certain that the details outlined in this review are \"outliers\" and below Isa's standards. However, I don't think it should have ever happened or there were mitigating factors (e.g., not being sloppy, quickly cleaning up broken glass underneath customer's feet, even saying \"sorry\" would have helped) that would have helped the evening be more pleasant. \n\nChef Luke Sung would be greatly disturbed and frustrated to learn that his culinary dishes have been compromised by poor service at Isa.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-01-25"}, {"excerpts": ["For appetizers, go for the dungeness crab salad and the yellowfin tuna.

"], "author": "Lydia W.", "review": "Came here for Dine About Town over the weekend and had a fantastic time. FYI, Isa is ONLY serving from the DAT menu until Jan 31. Luckily the menu is fairly extensive and they have a couple of additional items and add-ons.\n\nFor $5 extra you can get the lamb chops entree, and I think you can substitute any entree for foie gras. I sometimes wish they told you the specials when you sit down so that you haven't already committed and fantasized about your future meal before they spring on some new options. How rude is that! I'm mostly joking. \n\nCouldn't help but get a cocktail (who knew it was happy hour! it was so dark outside I didn't even realize it was between 5-7 and cocktails and glasses of wine were only $5!) I decided on Number Seven, which I think was a soju cocktail with huckleberry and ginger. Twas good, but what an unoriginal name. At least it was actually the seventh cocktail on the list. \n\nThe coolest thing about Isa is that \"everything is served family style\" or to share. So even though we all chose our own appetizers and entrees, they did a nice job of bringing out each dish individually so that we could focus on one dish and share it among the three of us. It lengthened our meal and made our eating experience more  enjoyable! I liked the style a lot; it allows you to actually focus on a dish and savor it.\n\nOut of all the appetizers, I most enjoyed the salmon carpaccio. It's a nice one to share. The dungeness crab salad was also really good. The prawns were okay, it surprisingly came with five(!!) and the oil is perfect for dipping bread into. I found the prawns to be a little too salty though and I usually don't complain about saltiness. \n\nBy the way, the bread is on point. It's like lightly toasted and still warm and just perfect. Beware of accidentally eating too much while waiting... and in between courses. \n\nAs far as entrees go, I got the chicken with mashed potatoes (sounds boring I know) but the chicken was moist, flavorful, and tantalizing! It was the last dish to arrive yet I still ate a hefty portion as it was just that good. \n\nThe petrale sole was also quite good. I wasn't that fond of the veggies it came with (some squash and artichokes) because they gave us the same ones in the steak entree. I did NOT enjoy the steak with bernaise sauce. Not worth it. Plus it comes with polenta and I have a deep seated hatred for polenta because it never tastes like anything and I don't understand how it could ever be good with anything.\n\nAs for desserts, do not get the grapefruit granite unless you LOVE grapefruit and can handle the sour-ness. It is incredibly intense but probably the lightest option out of the four. The very creamy vanilla bean gelato comes with both the biscotti order and the flourless chocolate cake. I loved the chocolate cake, which was quite light and almost souffle-like on the inside. The portion is perfect in that the last bite is JUST enough to not push you over the edge to discomfort but you're still scraping at the sides of the ramekin to clean off the chocolate remains because it is just that good.  \n\nAfter all of these words, I would definitely recommend Isa either for DAT or just on a regular day. Apparently their usual prix-fixe menu is cheaper than DAT. \n\nAlso, their back patio seating is super cute, warm, and feels kind of like a tent! It is spacious enough and also has a homey feeling.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The dungeness crab salad was really fresh", ", chicken was done to perfection, rib-eye steak just melted under the knife, and the sides were all delicious.

Well done, well well crafted... the Lady loved this dish the most, I can't really argue with her either...\n\nThen the mussels: good, but I've had better. The portion was generous, but was hoping for a bit more flavor really, either from the mussels themselves or the broth... \n\nMy other favorite dish had to be the scallops.  Five grilled scallops on a bed of buttery mash potatoes, topped with asparagus spears.  Asparagus is difficult to mess up; either you overcook them or you don't. These were perfect, of course.. The mash potatoes were great; don't remember ever having potatoes this good. Must have been all the butter in it.. And the scallops, juicy and tender. Reminded me of lobster in terms of flavor, tofu in terms of firmness.  Really amazing dish. The only drawback (kinda) was the small pool of butter from the remaining potato mash.  Women get turned off by this... Guess there's more for me then, sweeet..\n\nThe seabass was good, but can't agree with the establishment that this was their best item. Kinda overcooked in my opinion. The potato skin wrap supplied most of the flavor to the dish. It's really freakin delicious potato skin I have to say, but expected the seabass to play a bigger role in the dish.\n\nCreme brulee dessert with candle and a familiar sing-a-long for the Lady. Simple festivity, adoring recipient. Wish I had steadier camera hands.. doh!\n\nTwo coffees. Normally, I never drink coffee at the end of a dinner, it makes no sense. Shouldn't a meal start with coffee??  Nevertheless, never let a Lady drink alone... ok wow, its actually great-tasting, non-starbucks, delicious brewed coffee!

Knowing that most likely we'd need to go grab a drink elsewhere and just return at our scheduled time, we popped in to inquire just on the off chance that there was a table available for the three of us. The hostess let us know that there was a table finishing up but that it would most likely be about 15 minutes; she then personally escorted us over to an open spot at the bar and put us in the capable hands of the bartender. Who was fantastic! The hubs asked if they had Guinness and they did not, but the bartender suggested an alternative beer and described it so delectably that of course, we ordered one. Personable beyond belief. Our server, well, he was among the best parts of the evening. He explained the \"rules of the road\" and let us know that Isa recommends that each person at the table order one appetizer and one entree, and then everyone splits everything as the orders arrive. We were cautioned that things would arrive to the table as they came out of the kitchen (so, we didn't expect all three apps to land at the same time, or even before the entrees, etc.) and that was just fine with us! He also went into detail on the specials and took the time to make several specific recommendations. In the course of our initial conversation (and it was a conversation!) he let us know the correct pronunciation of the restaurant's name (EEE-sa) and let us know the story behind it (named for the chef's daughter Isabelle). Just a side note for any Yelpers thinking of trying Isa - 1. highly recommend it. 2. it's a California French style, not strictly French as categorized on Yelp. Not a huge thing, but it is definitely not purely French. Personally, the Californication of the food makes for a phenomenal product. Lastly about our knowledgeable, grin-inspiring server before I start in on the food: in the course of our conversation he came out with a from-the-gut laugh that was irreverent! It was one of those laughs that just makes you laugh as well. His laugh left all of us giggling along with him long after he'd left the table.\n\nFood:\n\nWe followed protocol and ordered three appetizers and three entrees, along with one side dish. First up: Tomales bay Pt Reyes oysters (6 oysters on the half shell with spicy orange mignonette). Fresh oysters are hard to mess up, but the orange mignonette really took them over the top into sublime territory. Next came the Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori and low sodium soy. Fresh, bright flavor! The clean flavor of the tuna was nicely offset by the mellow creaminess of the avocado. Yum! Our third appetizer was the Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon. Once again, a perfect symphony of complementary ingredients. The mellow of the crab was balanced with the creamy avocado and sweet apple, then perked up by the grapefruit and tarragon. C'est magnifique.\n\nOur entrees began to arrive next. Our first entree was the Seared scallops with saut\u00e9ed asparagus, garlic & truffle sauce. Four seared scallops were arranged on the plate with a mound of what may have been whipped potatoes topped with several spears of asparagus and drizzled with truffle sauce. The flavors came together beautifully and the truffle flavor was nicely subtle. We actually ordered a side dish of asparagus as well, not realizing that the scallops came with asparagus, but believe me, every stalk of asparagus on the table was eaten and enjoyed. The next entree to arrive was Seasonal Fish (halibut) with artichokes, tomato confit, olives, basil & zucchini. Delicious! Our final entree was the Potato wrapped Seabass with capers, fresno peppers, parsley, tomato confit, brown butter and lemon juice. The dish was excellent, but I am a sucker for anything brown butter so it put the entree over the top. \n\nAfter enjoying our apps and entrees so very much, we had to continue on to dessert. The hubs was being good and although we almost talked him into the grapefruit granite, he abstained and so we ordered two desserts instead of three. Both arrived at the same time, the first was a vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e which was sublime. The next was a vanilla bean gelato with biscotti and espresso, also fantastic. \n\nI cannot wait to come back here, it was just a phenomenal experience.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Dungeness crab salad with avocado, grapefruit, apple and tarragon.

This way we get to taste more.\n\nThe foie gras was definitely the best ever. Succulent, perfectly cooked, amazing sides that enhanced its flavor. It was an OMG dish.

Very light dressing, wonderful mix, very generous serving of perfectly seasoned crab. \n\nWe had two second courses, and it was a tie as to which one was the better one. \n\nThe flat iron steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare). The special menu said the steak was served with moutarde verte and bordelaise sauce. Truly amazing flavors. I'm actually glad they sliced the steak so that it was easy to share. We were literally lapping up the sauce with every bite. So scrumptious.\n\nThe duck breast with what appeared to be currant sauce was exceptional.

It's simply a broth without anything else in it, and it is strong and savory.  I really enjoyed it, although I would question getting it again because it's not very substantial.  If you like seafood flavor though, get this. 4/5\n+ Foie gras: Damn, this was delicious.  Fatty, fragrant, HUGE piece, and the berry sauce and brioche were perfect complements. A highlight of our meal. 5/5\n+ Veal sweetbreads: This was my favorite dish.  Also, whoever decided to call \"various animal organs\" sweetbreads deserves a prize; what a sneaky way to make animal parts sound appetizing.  And really, appetizing it was!  The sweetbreads (Am I saying it right? Just call it sweetbreads?) tasted like tender chicken, and on top of the gravy, mashed potatoes, and mushroom fricassee (fancy term for any stewed dish with meat and gravy), it was an amazing combination of ingredients, flavors, and textures.  Not to mention, the portion was very generous. Get it. 5/5\n+ Duck breast: I loved the salad that came alongside this dish, which included bacon bits.  The duck, however, was mediocre.  It was cooked medium, though we asked for medium-rare, and maybe it was because we had this right after the amazing sweetbreads, but it was just alright.  I'd skip it next time. 3.5/5\n+ Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato: I am not a dessert person. I am not a chocolate person.  I did not particularly care for this item. My foodmates, who ARE dessert and chocolate people, also didn't think too highly of this dish, so I don't think it's just me. 3/5. \n\nI was worried that a tapas-style meal = not enough food, but their portions are decently-sized and, for some dishes, pretty big.  For the three of us, five dishes left us filled and satisfied, without being too stuffed.  Plus, I think the endless bread helped too.\n\nFood also came quickly, and great timing with each new dish coming at a good rate after the one before.  Servers were just the right amount of attentive and helpful.\n\nThe food, overall, was very delicious and I really did enjoy every dish.  The final bill, for three drinks and five dishes and a dessert, came out to $112 after tax.  \n\nDefinitely a nicer and more expensive option for dinner, but worth it for a special occasion because the ambiance is cozy and nice (candles, dark lighting, etc.), service is fine, and most importantly, the food hits the spot.

Delicious.  Did I mention, delicious?  \n\nWe went to Isa on Tuesday of this week to celebrate a friend's promotion and we were not disappointed.  I have to admit, however, after reading some reviews on opentable.com, I was a bit nervous about our dining experience; the timing of the dishes kept coming up as a concern.\n\nThe experience starts with the location of Isa.  It is located in the Chestnut/Fillmore area and I was reminded of how much of a gem this area is.  Tuesday night was the 2nd night of the heatwave so it was a gorgeous night.  \n\nWe were taken care of by Dean, a lovely, lovely man, and he walked us through the optimal dining experience by basically explaining their vision and offering his assistance in choosing our dishes.  We agreed to choose 2 dishes p/person, making that 8 dishes total.  The first half of the menu is what you would consider lighter, appetizer fare, and the second half of the menu are the heavier dishes.  Their vision: that each dish is shared and that each dish is served after finishing the previous dish.  \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\nFirst half of the menu: Spicy Tuna Tartare (recommended), Dungeness Crab Salad (recommended; the grapefruit paired well with the crab salad), Seared Grade A Foie Gras (didn't try), and a Seafood Ceviche (forgive me as I've forgotten what fish was used in the ceviche)(highly recommended if you like ceviche).\n\nSecond half of the menu: Baked Butterfish in Paper (highly recommended. fish melted in your mouth.  flavors worked well together), Caramelized Dayboat Scallops, King trumpet, Morel &amp; Shiitake Mushroom Risotto (recommended), and a Seafood Risotto (highly recommended).\n\nReally, everything we ordered was delicious.  \n\nTheir wine list included areas such as California, Italy, Oregon, South Africa, New Zealand, and Spain!  I appreciate that the wine menu was inclusive of different areas/countries, and that it wasn't an overwhelming list of choices.\n\nThe timing of the dishes was... impeccable.  At one point, we had 3 of our lighter fare on the table and it was after our 4th dish that the next 4 dishes, the heavier fare, came after the previous was finished.  I was impressed.  Once our table was cleared of a dish, the next one came within a minute or two, and it arrived piping hot so it was obvious to us that it hadn't been sitting around.  I still am impressed.  And may I just say that I appreciate their vision, although I know it isn't for everyone, and I agree with Dean's sentiments that bringing one dish out at a time really encourages you, and allows you the rare opportunity to enjoy, savor and appreciate the food/dish for what it is.  You take your time because there is only one dish on the table.  You are more prone to talk about it's flavors and what your thoughts are as you work your way through the dish.  You are less prone to eating at a fast pace.    \n\nDining at Isa is such an experience that speaks beyond eating out, I think it talks to life, in general.  It sort of reminds you to slow down sometimes, as cliche as it sounds, regardless of your daily grind.  It reminds you that food is nourishing, and that eating should be a positive experience for all involved. \n\nSo I raise my glass to Luke Sung for his vision and execution; I really do feel the commitment, hardwork, and love.  I also raise my glass to Dean, and his support staff, for taking such good care of us, and for making it an unforgettable night.\n\nI will DEFINITELY be returning to try the other half of the menu!", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-10-18"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the dungeness crab salad, but I don't know if the grapefruit complemented the seafood flavor very well.

It was...okay. One might save a few dollars ordering from the DAT menu versus the normal menu, but if one tends to order a salad, a risotto or chicken and a dessert, you're probably better off with the normal menu pricing.\n\nFood wise. I'm not sure why this place gets rave reviews.  The mignonette sauce for the raw oysters had too much vinegar/acid. The dungeness crab salad had a good balance of crab, and citrus fruit for acidity, but is missing another ingredient to take it to the next level. The baked goat cheese was okay, but the cheese taste and texture dominates the taste of pesto and pinenuts.

Taste, texture, plate composition were just messy and rough. A note for vegetarians: the soup and the risotto are not vegetarian friendly, as they use a meat broth. The \"vegetarian plate\" is only main dish available and is basically a mishmash of the vegetables and non-meat items from other dishes thrown into one plate. \n\nFor dessert, the gelato was actually pretty good. I wonder from where they source it. The creme brulee has a decent caramel top, but the custard inside is definitely very light. It did not have texture of a normal custard.\n\nAmbiance wise, the back seating room can get very,very loud and impossible to talk without basically yelling. At the end of the night, my throat was a little sore. The front room tends to be noisier earlier in the night, but 9pm on, it empties out and is quieter.\n\nOverall, I think the price range of Isa allows people to give a good review partially because of value, but mediocre food is still mediocre food.

My girls and I had reservations at 830 pm. However, we were not seated until 9-910pm. We had plenty of time to look over the menu as we were waiting. Ordered right when we were seated. It was a four course meal. \n\nFirst course: We ordered three potato and leek soup and a arugula salad. Also, ordered a dozen oysters. The soup arrived first with bread and butter. The three soups were almost finished and we decided to ask our waiter for the status of the salad. Waiter's response was, \"we will bring it out when the kitchen is done with it.\" One of our second course dish came out and I asked our waiter about the salad that never came. To my surprise, he came inches away from my face and said, \"I TOLD YOU, WE WILL BRING IT OUT WHEN THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point, I'm in total shock. I have never ever in my life had a waiter get in my face like that. I sat there in disbelief and did not say a word. Luckily, my best friend who was sitting in front of me questioned the waiter about his rudeness. We had asked the manager of the restaurant for a new waiter. That kind of behavior and customer service is unacceptable. \n\nSecond course: I recommend the mussels and the goat cheese. Both were really good and had a lot of flavor. We also tried to salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. Not as good as it sounds. Also, as our waiter was serving our dishes, he knocked down a glass of wine on my best friend across from me. The entire restaurant went quiet as we all watch her wipe off all the wine that was on her face, neck, and shirt! The waiter was really apologetic and he seemed to be very sincere and genuine with his apology. It was truly an accident, and we didn't want to make him feel worst than he probably already feels about spilling the wine. We said it was totally okay and that he didn't have to keep apologizing. \n\nThird course: Seared scallops with bacon and mashed potatoes was a hit. Super good! I would also recommend the truffle risotto. We also ordered the seasonal fish with spinach. Fish was really bland, but the spinach was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the angus flat iron steak came. My friend took a bite from the steak and it was cold. Not warm but COLD. It was probably sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it was served to us. We mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter responded with, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? Is this a new thing where steak is served cold?? The was absolutely the last straw for everyone at our table. Waiter took the plate back in to the kitchen and brought it back a few moments later. The pieces of steak that were moved when my friend tried to eat it was at the same placement when the waiter had brought it back to the kitchen. We figured they just microwaved it and brought it back. We barely ate the steak and asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. \n\nFourth course: While waiting for our dessert, our bill came. Waiter came back and wanted to know why we didn't want dessert. They must've misunderstood us, because we had asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. Due to the confusion, we probably had to wait another 15-20 minutes for some darn ice cream and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nThis has got to be the worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant.

Unfortunately, I was only able to get a table at 5:15pm on a Sunday night, which was a bit early. The plus side is that they have happy hour until 7pm, so we got dollar oysters and $5 soju/wines to start off. Drinks are not too strong, but tasty and oysters were standard. The restaurant enters a dim-lit dining area as you're taken through the back. It's a covered outdoor backyard with strings of lights and heated lamps. There's plants hanging all around to give a cozy and romantic ambiance with an outdoor feel. I was head over heels with their d\u00e9cor of the restaurant. To add, we were treated with a warm and chirpy welcome from the server telling us that they have been waiting 15 years for our arrival. What a silly guy.\n\nAlthough complimentary bread was offered, we were also warned to not stuff ourselves since we had a lot of food coming our way. The 4-course restaurant week started off with a Smooth Potato Leek Soup and Arugula Salad. Both were decent, but the salad lacked some flavor. Second course was the Yellowfin Tuna and Organic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio. As a huge fan of raw fish, I loved both of these dishes. The only problem was that I was not too hungry coming in for dinner, so we were both pretty stuffed by this point.\n\nThe main course was the Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast and Grilled Golden Gate Natural Flat Iron Steak. Both of them came with a side of greens: steak with zucchini and potatoes/duck with spinach and beets. Both dishes were very solid and tasty, but I think I was way too stuffed to enjoy any more of it. Thankfully we decided to boxed these up and move onto our dessert. We finished with the Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee and Buche Au Lait De Crevre Aged Goat Cheese. The date loved the goat cheese while I indulged myself in the cr\u00e8me brulee.

The last two years were fully booked, so when the participating restaurants were announced again this year, my friend and I immediately jumped on the opportunity.\n\nWhen we walked in, it seemed very quiet and intimate, but our hostess led us out back to the covered porch where it was much more lively. Our server Jon informed us that restaurant week was actually served more family style so he highly recommended ordering different dishes so we could try everything - thank you for the honesty sir!\n\nWe started with the potato leek soup and the butter lettuce salad. The potato leek soup was delicious. The truffle oil on top helped give it that earthy flavor which was then spiked by the delicious bacon pieces in the soup. As for the butter lettuce salad, I thought it was a little too deconstructed. Leaves were coated in balsamic vinaigrette but were just stacked atop a few candied walnuts and crumbles of blue cheese and a few slivers of pear. But when when you gathered all the ingredients together, the bite was really good. Nutty, creamy, sweet, with a little bite.\n\nSecond came the salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. The carpaccio was dressed in creme fraiche with capers, lemon, cucumbers and little bits of egg. Flavors were excellent, but fish was sliced somewhat unevenly. As for the yellowfin tuna, it had a more Asian flair. It was dressed in light soy sauce with a touch of sriracha which definitely gave it a slightly spicy undertone - delicious in my opinion.\n\nNext came the main entrees. The seared scallops were TO. DIE. FOR. They had a beautiful golden crust for the sear and perfectly buttery in texture. My only complaint was that there were only 3 for a main entree. The majority of the plate was composed of vegetables, served in a variety of ways. The risotto was equally delicious, but a bit too rich for my taste buds. Very creamy and very hearty for those who enjoy that type of plate though. And they also don't skimp on the mushrooms!\n\nFor dessert, we opted for the vanilla bean creme brulee and semifreddo. The creme brulee came as expected. I personally thought the sugar crust was too thick, but my friend thought it was done perfectly. In my opinion, it should break like glass, very light revealing that smooth, not fully set custard underneath. As for the semifreddo, it did not skimp on the amaretto flavor - but I love almond, so I found this dessert very delicious. It wasn't too sweet, but it was refreshing (because it was cold) and a nice way to wrap up the meal.\n\nAll in all. 4 courses for $40 is a great value. Add in the share factor and being able to taste 8 different dishes made it an even better experience. The only thing was that I felt service was a bit rushed - perhaps because they were trying to turn over as many tables as possible to accommodate restaurant week.

Not only did they offer four courses, but their dishes actually had variety and were worth trying, unlike many of the other contenders churning out a cookie cutter 3-course menu of soup or salad, boring entree, and brownie dessert. The portions were a good size, just a touch smaller than their usual portions. I'll include the current prices.\nWe were seated in the covered patio area behind the restaurant, which was probably a backyard in the past. Even though it was cold outside, the heating lamps and covered awning provided enough warmth and shelter. It felt cozy and inviting.\n\n$10 Maine Lobster Broth w/ prawns, tomato, celery & tarragon:\nHot & savory bowl that warmed me up from the first taste. There were just a couple pieces of lobster & prawn, but they were good-sized chunks. The broth was smooth and satisfying.\n\n$15 Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori & *low sodium soy:\nCubes of tuna served tartare style over creamy chunks of avocado, with seaweed salad. It was very good, but I wouldn't normally order this at a French restaurant.\n\n$16 Dungeness Crab Salad w/ avocado, apples, grapefruit & tarragon:\nThe shredded crab was not too shredded and the pieces were still substantial enough to be satisfying. The avocado, apple slices, and grapefruit each added variations in texture, and some tart and sweet flavors to the mix.\n\n$24 Seared Scallops w/ mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon & truffle sauce:\nScallops were seared just right with a browned surface, but still had a meaty and springy texture. Brussel sprouts were roasted to a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were so good with the savory sauce.\n\n$23 Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce:\nThe slices of flat iron were juicy and tender. The sauce on top was like a chimichurri, good flavor, but could have used more of it.\n\n$7 Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: \nCreme brulee isn't my favorite dessert. I still do enjoy taking a spoon and giving the torched caramelized crust a whack and seeing the broken window effect. Surprisingly it didn't break, as it was a rather thick crust. The custard underneath was nice and smooth.\n\n$7 Semifreddo all' Amaretto:\nI didn't know what to make of this semifreddo. I've had semifreddos before, but this seemed like half ice cream and half frozen bread. At least that was the texture that came to my mind. The almond cookies were good. I don't care for presentation or garnishes, but in this case, the sprig of mint was much needed to make this dish look good.\n\nNow that I think about it, I probably would enjoy the grapefruit granite. I wonder why I never tried it. \n\nThe chef has quite an impressive resume. I can see how he's going for a Californian Provencal menu, but most of the dishes seem more Californian to me.\nWould I eat here again? Since I've tried the above dishes, there's not much on the prix fix menu that intrigues me, except maybe the salmon carpaccio or the truffle risotto. I am interested in trying the foie gras though.

They're one of the very few restaurants offering a prix-fixe four-course menu for RW dinner for $40. \n\nINTERIOR\nThis place is super cozy for dinner, especially on rainy evenings. There were lots of people waiting in the front to be seated, but luckily I made a reservation. The hated patio seating is absolutely amazing and ask to be seated there if you can! There's plenty of heat lamps and wonderfully decorated string lights that really ups the ambiance more so than the other sections of the restaurant.\n\nSERVICE\nExcellent service! Our waiter was super friendly and smiley. Even though he was serving many tables that night, he was very patient with taking our orders and listening to our requests. The staff was very courteous overall. At the end of the meal, they gave us a sealed envelope with a surprise coupon inside, only to be opened by the staff when you visit next time. Very enticing! \n\nFOOD\nI really liked that the food was meant for sharing, and the servers would bring the plates to the middle of the table instead to each of us. We never had to wait too long between courses, but there were some discrepancies when one of us got a course way before another, so it just felt like a continuous stream of plates being served. \n\nFirst Course\nArugula salad: Pretty delicious, standard salad. The dressing on these salads are usually very flavorful, and they never dump an obscene amount of dressing on it. \nSmooth potato leek soup: This dish was really good, and I preferred this over the salad. The soup is very, very umami flavored which is great. Wonderful to dip bread in! \n\nSecond Course\nBaked Goat Cheese: This one took a while to come out because baking takes a while, but I recommend this for people who love goat cheese (and pizza!) It tasted more like a pizza without the crust, so I naturally used the bread that came with the meal as a dipping tool. \nYellowfin Tuna: My boyfriend ordered this and said it was comparable for the price point with an almost identical Yellowfin Tuna dish from Jean-Georges. Even though he's not a big fan of seafood, he thought it was prepared very well.\n\nThird Course \nTruffle Risotto: yummm mushroom overload! Although, compared to other same-tier restaurants I've been to for RW, the truffle flavor wasn't as flavorful as others. Still very delicious though.\nAngus flat iron steak: The waiter recommended medium-rare which is what my bf got, but he thinks it would have been overall if it was just cooked medium. This is more of a preference thing though.\n\nFourth Course\nGrapefruit Granite: This was a very tarty grapefruit shaved ice, and while it was good, it didn't wow me since shaved ice can only impress so much. Our waiter recommended that we eat this dessert first since the flavor is much stronger than the other. \nSemifreddo all'amaretto: This dessert was fantastic! The flavors are not overwhelmingly sweet like I expected it to be, and all the flavors worked so well together that it felt like a light ice cream cake. I've actually never had semifreddo before and omg I can eat this forever.\n\nOVERALL\nFantastic experience, service, ambiance.

Such a steal!\n\nFor the entrees, I decided on the truffle mushroom risotto my friends had raved about. My friend with with the pan roasted rocky jr. chicken. Hers came out first, and I'm not a huge chicken person, but my goodness. This chicken was perfectly cooked, so juicy and tender, and they put the seasoning of herbs under the skin. WOW. So much flavor, and with the fluffy mashed potatoes and string beans, I was in heaven! The risotto came out next, and it was pretty darn amazing. A little on the heavy side, but enjoyed as much as I could since I was so full after the oysters! I would say the chicken was the winner to me since I was not expecting to have that wow factor from it.\n\nLastly, our desserts came out, and the only one that sounded appetizing to us was the semifreddo all amaretto, after Jonathan described it. It was almost like an almond cookie ice cream, not super cold, and had more of a substance of almond cookie mash. It was really good, and the manager brought me a glass of port for my bday. \n\nAll in all, a great experience. Would definitley recommend this place to others, and they do a 3 course prix-fixe menu Sunday - Thursday for a really reasonable price.

Well worth the wait as the meal and entire dining experience was top notch. Isa is nestled in the heart of the Marina district, juxtaposed between other cute eateries, wineries, and boutique shops. Parking can be difficult here, as I had anticipated from previous Marina adventures, so my friends and I took the 45 bus from 3rd&Market (which took about 45 minutes) to get here.  \n\nIsa's food is described as French-style cuisine which was apparent in some but not all the dishes.  I would describe their cuisine more as Asian-European fusion as many of their dishes had elements of different countries' cuisines on both continents. But overall all the dishes were delicious and well presented.  Isa's food is meant to be shared (e.g. Family style), and so my friends and I shared the dungeoness  crab salad, the baked goat cheese, grilled calamari, the yellowfin tuna, the scallops, the duck breast, the sea bass, and the wild mushroom truffle risotto.

The other dishes were good too, but not as amazing as the three I just mentioned.  Although of note, the scallops were tasty but I thought the accompanied orzo tasted kind of funny (maybe because I'm not much of a fan of orzo).\n\nMy friends and I came here early, at 5:30 for dinner because we wanted to watch the fireworks in the Marina afterwards.  On weekdays, Isa offers a pretty extensive happy hour drinks menu list, which features some specialty cocktails and wines for $5 (until 7pm). Needless to say my friends and I both had 3 drinks each.  Most of the cocktails are pretty tasty, but the Negroni is pretty strong. I was hoping it would be on the sweeter side, which it ultimately was, but I could taste more alcohol than sweet/sugar. I couldn't enjoy that drink as much as I wanted.\n\nThe service here is top notch, as wait staff always come around to fill bread, water and ask if how the food is and if you want to order more drinks/food.  Very professional and attentive staff.\n\nOverall my first experience at Isa was excellent as the food and service here were great!

No explosive flavors.\n\n2nd Course:\nDungeness Crab Salad: The crab was almost non existent. It was more lettuce than anything. \nYellowfin Tuna: Had just the right amount of spice. This item was one of the more memorable ones.\n\n3rd Course:\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: Another memorable item that I will never stop thinking about. The meat was so tasty and tender and the beets were to die for.\nBraised Short Ribs: Fall off the bone, tender meat served with mashed potatoes and veggies. So full of flavor and a definite MUST.\n\n4th Course:\nSemifreddo all' Amaretto: A yummy, creamy, not too sweet custard served with three small vanilla cookies. \nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee: The name says it all.

They build an outdoor area with covers and it looks amazing. Loved the ambiance of the place.\n\n****TIP****\nHAPPY HOUR\nDollar oysters and half off alcohol menu!\n\nThe menu allowed us to have 4 entr\u00e9es. The first course, I picked the potato leek soup and my coworker got the arugula salad.  The soup was alright in my book but paired with the bread and butter they gave us that I dipped into the soup make it amazing! The free bread and butter reminded me of France. The butter was so yummy! (I know....all the rave about the bread and butter but....oh well)\n\nSince the waiter (who was super friend btw) told us they served everything family style and it comes out all together. The next thing that showed up was my coworker's salmon carpaccio (think that's what it was called) and that was super good! It had eggs and cucumber with it along with pieces of smoked salmon with a crustini. Yum! Before my yellow fin tuna came out, my risotto came out. Now, I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but it was a truffle risotto and of course I had to get it! Anything truffle, I'm ok with it...just other mushrooms makes me gag. Tried it and you get this heavy truffle taste along with parmesan . Yum! (Can I say, by this time I've engorged myself with so much bread and butter that I'm super stuffed!) But still, I couldn't help myself in scooping more risotto onto my plate. \n\nAfter that, the yellowfin tuna came out and it's of course, all raw. (Just realized that most everything we ordered were raw...hah) This was really delicious! The bottom had some avocado and drenched with some sriracha. Yum!  The combination gave me this heavy and spicy feeling and matched with the tuna, it was amazing! (Not sure if my description makes sense. hah)\n\nThen, onto the duck my coworker ordered. This was my least favorite...I'm not much of a duck person but it was pretty good. This...was also cooked a little raw (i never knew you could eat duck raw!) Maybe it was my mentality but eating it raw kinda make me go...ehh...no. For some reason, anything that's a bird and raw makes me scared because of chicken.

We both got the vanilla bean creme brulee. Yum! It was smooth and really delicious!

We had the braised short rib with broccolini and buttery mashed potatoes. The mash was really good but the short rib was melt in your mouth delicious.

One of the reasons I chose Isa out of all the other restaurants was because they offer four courses instead of three like most of the other restaurants on the list. (Foodie much? Yes. Must eat ALL the foods.) \n\nThe restaurant is really pretty. We were led to the back where it's decorated like an outside patio. The lights were dimmed and there were white Christmas lights hung across. Ah it was romantic and intimate. Perfect mood for a date. \n\nFirst course\nCorn soup: Honestly can't remember much about this.\nMaine Lobster Broth: It was rich in flavor and had a few pieces of lobster to chew on. Simple but very flavorful. \n\nSecond course\nSalmon Carpaccio: Omgosh, this dish was de-LICIOUS. I don't remember exactly what our waiter said but it was something along the lines of the salmon not being sold on the market and it's imported from another country. Yes..something like that. Whether I remember correctly or not, I can for sure tell you that salmon was out of this world. Yum! Definitely recommend this dish. \nYellowfin Tuna: This was just as delicious as the salmon carpaccio. If you like raw fish, both of these dishes are perfect for a second course. \n\nThird course\nTruffle Risotto: ABSOLUTELY recommend this dish! If you like truffle, you will love this dish. It's rich in flavor and very heavy so we couldn't eat much of it at once. \nFlat Iron Steak: This was a good choice as well. The steak was grilled to perfection (medium rare) and it went well with the zucchini and roasted potatoes.\n\nFourth course\nWe had the Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e and Semifreddo all' amaretto. Both weren't too special compared to our rest of our meal. \n\nOh and we also took advantage of the $1 oysters! We each had six and they were plump and juicy! Yum! \n\nAll the dishes are served to be shared so be prepared for a lot of food! We were filled to the brim by the middle of the third course so we had a lot of leftovers to take home.

My wife and I recently went there on a double date, and we all enjoyed it.\n\nThe setup is interesting.  The restaurant appears to be small and narrow up front, but the back is quite expansive.  In fact, I've only ever sat in the back, which appears to be a backyard patio converted for indoor use.  There looks to be a retractable roof of sorts, but I think they keep it covered year-round.  Heating lamps make the area very cozy.  I actually enjoyed the unique experience of being semi-outdoors much more than dining indoors as is the case with almost every restaurant.\n\nThe food here is served tapas style, so we ordered a bunch of small plates to be shared.  We went on a Sunday, which gave us the opportunity to order from a special, discounted prix fixe menu ($29.95 for 2 courses + dessert) .   However, we opted to \"ball out\" by select several dishes from the regular menu.  We did manage to take advantage of one prix fixe set given the number of items.

Two members of our party really liked it though.\n\nSeared Scallops - Probably my favorite entree. Beautifully seared scallops with bacon mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Can't go wrong.\n\nPetrale Sole - Not a huge fan of this dish. Fish had a nice crisp on the outside but it was a little too overcooked for my liking. Beets were pretty tasty though and I'm not generally a fan of beets.\n\nTruffle Mushroom Risotto - Pretty good, didn't think it was that special though. \n\nFlank Steak - Tender and had a good flavor from the sauce.\n\nGrapefruit Granite - Didn't think I would like this but I was pleasantly surprised.

Family style\n2. Bread\n\nLet me explain. The whole concept of Isa is French food served family style. We had a group of 6 and each of us were able to try at least fifteen things on the menu because we all shared every single dish. Of course, there was 1 dish that we all agreed was \"meh\", which was the crab salad. However...the rest of the dishes were A+ phenomenal. This is where the word \"Bread\" comes in.\n\nThe bread was great. If I had to guess it was Acme bread, and boy was there a lot of it. The best part was that every time we got more bread, it came out piping hot. The bread itself was 3-4 star worthy, but what made me realize that Isa was so amazing was that out of the fifteen or so dishes we ordered, I dipped the bread into the remaining juices/sauce/crumbs of each dish and they elevated the bread to a delicious, almost addicting hors d'oeuvre. That's what made me put Isa on a pedestal. It could take an ordinary piece of bread and turn it into an extraordinary delectable bite.\n\nThis example only serves to highlight the extraordinary flavors characteristic of every appetizer, entree, and dessert we ordered. Our favorites:\n\n1. Potato crusted sea bass\n2. Yellowfin Tuna\n3. Rack of Lamb\n4. Grapefruit Granite\n\nI can't wait to come back here.

We made sure to order different dishes so we could taste more of the menu.\n\nFirst course: \n\nLobster Broth- I felt like I was drinking a small swimming pool for shrimp mixed with some tomato juice. Super raw. Even the shrimp was a bit below average and seemed a bit overcooked so this soup was only half eaten.\n\nPotato and Leek Soup- DELISHHHH! I love leeks and this just had enough flavor and the perfect amount of potatoes. My sister had a miss on hers so she kept trying to sneak in spoonfuls when I wasn't looking.\n\nSecond course: \n\nYellowfin Tuna Tartare- Can't really vouch for this since I don't like raw seafood but my sister seemed to really enjoy it and I guess tiny bit of seaweed salad met my standards.\n\nMussels: OH MY GOD. FLAVOR EXPLOSION IN MY MOUTH! This dish was big enough to be my whole dinner! I felt like Isa reserved their biggest and tastiest mussels just for me. I even got seconds on bread because I wanted to soak up all the delicious garlicky mussel broth. Take that, lobster broth! \n\nThird course:\n\nDuck Breast- YUM!!! I think this baby was cooked to tender perfection. The salad complimented the duck and the vinaigrette married the flavors together. I would definitely order this one again.\n\nFlat Iron Steak- My sister thought it was too gamey. I had no problem with it. Ate all of it because I didn't want to ask for a to-go box. But flavors as a whole, it wasn't very memorable.\n\nFourth course:\n\nCreme Brulee- Soft and fluffy. And sweet flavors.\n\nSemifreddo- Great presentation and tasted a bit more like coffee rather than almonds but delicious nonetheless.\n\nWhat I really loved about this place was their service. I was seated near the kitchen so it kind of took away from the ambiance but servers and waiters kept checking up on us which sort of made up for it. Our waiter was a bit awkward but was very attentive. While my sister was doing her usual photo shoot with the food, I was moving the tiny candle around to give her more light. By the third course, I accidentally tipped it too far and put out the light which made my table dark and bummed my out for a good 10 min. When our waiter came by to refill our water, he noticed our light was out. \"OH, what happened to the candle?\" I innocently responded, \"I don't know...\" He immediately told us he'll grab us another one and 20 seconds later, I got a new candle on the table.

The food was good to excellent, but the service left something to be desired. \n\nDRINKS  - Given that they don't have a full liquor license, I was really impressed by Isa's cocktail menu. We didn't like the Number Seven, probably because of the champagne, but the Lemon Drop was great. My boyfriend was also drunk after about 3 sips.... We later ordered the McIntyre Pinot Noir for the table, which was delicious.\n\nSERVICE -- The hostess in the front was a delight. Our waiter I'm only giving Isa 4 stars. He was an older Asian man who talked to us like we were idiots, wouldn't stop talking, and seemed fairly oblivious to what we actually wanted (i.e. a wine recommendation, but no food recommendations, and for him to stop talking). He was completely irritating, and we didn't need him to walk us through every single menu item.\n\nFOOD - We were *strongly* encouraged to order one item from the top half of the menu and one item from the bottom half of the menu per person. We actually ordered 5 and 5 dishes for the 6 of us, which was the perfect amount of food (maybe just a little too much). The waiter warned us, on repeat, that the chef was a proponent of \"something called family style\" and that he recommended we plan on sharing everything, which we did. \n\nSalmon Carpaccio - incredibly well done, delicate, and flavorful. Just perfect. \n\nArugula Salad - Great proportions of all the ingredients and very fresh with a light dressing. \n\nTruffle Risotto - probably my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly infused with a great combination of rice and mushrooms. \n\nRoasted Rack of Lamb - a little gamey, even though our waiter promised it wouldn't be, but otherwise delicious. Not easy to share, but still good. \n\nDuck Breast - definitely interesting, but not my favorite. \n\nNot particularly memorable but still good: Yellowfin Tuna, Butter Lettuce Salad, Grilled Local Calamari, Seared Scallops, and the Flat Iron Steak. \n\nSUMMARY - The food was mostly outstanding, and if I were able to request a different server, I'd be back here in a heartbeat.

Five stars.\n\nHere's why.\n\nService: \n\nFrom start to finish...impeccable. We arrived an hour before our reservation time. Knowing that most likely we'd need to go grab a drink elsewhere and just return at our scheduled time, we popped in to inquire just on the off chance that there was a table available for the three of us. The hostess let us know that there was a table finishing up but that it would most likely be about 15 minutes; she then personally escorted us over to an open spot at the bar and put us in the capable hands of the bartender. Who was fantastic! The hubs asked if they had Guinness and they did not, but the bartender suggested an alternative beer and described it so delectably that of course, we ordered one. Personable beyond belief. Our server, well, he was among the best parts of the evening. He explained the \"rules of the road\" and let us know that Isa recommends that each person at the table order one appetizer and one entree, and then everyone splits everything as the orders arrive. We were cautioned that things would arrive to the table as they came out of the kitchen (so, we didn't expect all three apps to land at the same time, or even before the entrees, etc.) and that was just fine with us! He also went into detail on the specials and took the time to make several specific recommendations. In the course of our initial conversation (and it was a conversation!) he let us know the correct pronunciation of the restaurant's name (EEE-sa) and let us know the story behind it (named for the chef's daughter Isabelle). Just a side note for any Yelpers thinking of trying Isa - 1. highly recommend it. 2. it's a California French style, not strictly French as categorized on Yelp. Not a huge thing, but it is definitely not purely French. Personally, the Californication of the food makes for a phenomenal product. Lastly about our knowledgeable, grin-inspiring server before I start in on the food: in the course of our conversation he came out with a from-the-gut laugh that was irreverent! It was one of those laughs that just makes you laugh as well. His laugh left all of us giggling along with him long after he'd left the table.\n\nFood:\n\nWe followed protocol and ordered three appetizers and three entrees, along with one side dish. First up: Tomales bay Pt Reyes oysters (6 oysters on the half shell with spicy orange mignonette). Fresh oysters are hard to mess up, but the orange mignonette really took them over the top into sublime territory. Next came the Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori and low sodium soy. Fresh, bright flavor! The clean flavor of the tuna was nicely offset by the mellow creaminess of the avocado. Yum! Our third appetizer was the Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon. Once again, a perfect symphony of complementary ingredients. The mellow of the crab was balanced with the creamy avocado and sweet apple, then perked up by the grapefruit and tarragon. C'est magnifique.\n\nOur entrees began to arrive next. Our first entree was the Seared scallops with saut\u00e9ed asparagus, garlic & truffle sauce. Four seared scallops were arranged on the plate with a mound of what may have been whipped potatoes topped with several spears of asparagus and drizzled with truffle sauce. The flavors came together beautifully and the truffle flavor was nicely subtle. We actually ordered a side dish of asparagus as well, not realizing that the scallops came with asparagus, but believe me, every stalk of asparagus on the table was eaten and enjoyed. The next entree to arrive was Seasonal Fish (halibut) with artichokes, tomato confit, olives, basil & zucchini. Delicious! Our final entree was the Potato wrapped Seabass with capers, fresno peppers, parsley, tomato confit, brown butter and lemon juice. The dish was excellent, but I am a sucker for anything brown butter so it put the entree over the top. \n\nAfter enjoying our apps and entrees so very much, we had to continue on to dessert. The hubs was being good and although we almost talked him into the grapefruit granite, he abstained and so we ordered two desserts instead of three. Both arrived at the same time, the first was a vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e which was sublime. The next was a vanilla bean gelato with biscotti and espresso, also fantastic. \n\nI cannot wait to come back here, it was just a phenomenal experience.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the yellowfin tuna.

The last two years were fully booked, so when the participating restaurants were announced again this year, my friend and I immediately jumped on the opportunity.\n\nWhen we walked in, it seemed very quiet and intimate, but our hostess led us out back to the covered porch where it was much more lively. Our server Jon informed us that restaurant week was actually served more family style so he highly recommended ordering different dishes so we could try everything - thank you for the honesty sir!\n\nWe started with the potato leek soup and the butter lettuce salad. The potato leek soup was delicious. The truffle oil on top helped give it that earthy flavor which was then spiked by the delicious bacon pieces in the soup. As for the butter lettuce salad, I thought it was a little too deconstructed. Leaves were coated in balsamic vinaigrette but were just stacked atop a few candied walnuts and crumbles of blue cheese and a few slivers of pear. But when when you gathered all the ingredients together, the bite was really good. Nutty, creamy, sweet, with a little bite.\n\nSecond came the salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. The carpaccio was dressed in creme fraiche with capers, lemon, cucumbers and little bits of egg. Flavors were excellent, but fish was sliced somewhat unevenly. As for the yellowfin tuna, it had a more Asian flair. It was dressed in light soy sauce with a touch of sriracha which definitely gave it a slightly spicy undertone - delicious in my opinion.\n\nNext came the main entrees. The seared scallops were TO. DIE. FOR. They had a beautiful golden crust for the sear and perfectly buttery in texture. My only complaint was that there were only 3 for a main entree. The majority of the plate was composed of vegetables, served in a variety of ways. The risotto was equally delicious, but a bit too rich for my taste buds. Very creamy and very hearty for those who enjoy that type of plate though. And they also don't skimp on the mushrooms!\n\nFor dessert, we opted for the vanilla bean creme brulee and semifreddo. The creme brulee came as expected. I personally thought the sugar crust was too thick, but my friend thought it was done perfectly. In my opinion, it should break like glass, very light revealing that smooth, not fully set custard underneath. As for the semifreddo, it did not skimp on the amaretto flavor - but I love almond, so I found this dessert very delicious. It wasn't too sweet, but it was refreshing (because it was cold) and a nice way to wrap up the meal.\n\nAll in all. 4 courses for $40 is a great value. Add in the share factor and being able to taste 8 different dishes made it an even better experience. The only thing was that I felt service was a bit rushed - perhaps because they were trying to turn over as many tables as possible to accommodate restaurant week.

The timing was good as it fell on Restaurant Week.  Upon arrival, the hostess immediately led us through a narrow passage to the back of the restaurant.

The setting was not what we had expected but it was fine.\n\nOur waiter was charming and persuaded me to start off with a cocktail called \"Number Seven.\"  It was a mixture of soju, blackberries, ginger and champagne.  Unfortunately, the drink was a miss for me.  Apart from the sweetness, there just wasn't enough of everything aforementioned.\n\nWe ordered a few things for dinner.  For our starter, the oysters on the half shell were accompanied by an orange mignonette.  The tangy sauce had a kick.  I could not say I was a fan of the taste but it got our palates ready for sure.  I had the Butter Lettuce Salad with pears, walnuts, watercress and blue cheese.  The plating looked rather messy and could have used more cheese or dressing to enhance the flavor.  My wife's Arugula Salad had apples, oranges, fennel and parmesan in a lemon vinaigrette.  It was really refreshing.\n\nOnward to more substance, the Steamed Mussels served in a white wine garlic broth were very flavorful.  I also couldn't get enough of the Baked Goat Cheese.  It was just lovely together with the basil pesto and pine nuts.  The next course for my wife was Seared Scallops in truffle sauce.   They were perfectly cooked and the medley of orzo, favas, corn, and tomatoes was a nice accent.  My Angus Flat Iron Steak was slightly over for me but the Bordelaise sauce was nice.\n\nNo matter how full you are, a meal is not complete without dessert.  We each picked a different one.

My friend and I eventually settled on a reservation for Tuesday night at 6pm because it was the only night with normal dinner availability. Even though we arrived 30 minutes after opening, the restaurant was already packed and it stayed that way for the entire 2 hours we were there. \n\nWe decided to order different items per course because there was so many options for each, so we started off with a potato leek soup and butter lettuce salad.

Next we had the tuna and mussels appetizers. The clear winner here was the mussels: they were sweet and juicy and not overly salty (although a tad on the small side) while the tuna itself didn't have much flavor and I felt that the avocado didn't particularly complement it. \n\nFor our main course, we had the flat iron steak and the duck breast, both cooked medium rare per their suggestion. Both meats were so tender and flavorful! The butter on the steak was a nice touch but it would've been fine on its own, and the thinly sliced zucchini went well with it. I've never had medium rare duck before this, but I was thoroughly impressed by this dish - the golden beets were light and refreshing and the sauce even had whole cranberries! For dessert we both had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was absolutely amazing. We both ended up scraping all the crusted sugar off the edges of the ramekin - no shame - because it was that good.\n\nThis restaurant is perfect for date night as it's super cozy and quiet enough to hold a conversation at a normal volume. Our table was kind of awkward as we were seated in a corner sitting next to each other and facing out the window, and it seemed to be difficult for servers to bring/clear our plates, but at least the food made up for this. Servers were also very attentive and polite, and I thought it was really cool how every customer gets a mystery reward to redeem at a later time - great incentive to get people to come back.

I ordered the Greyhound Soju cocktail which was pretty sweeth and yummy and had just enough to kick. Since it was Restaurant week we had a prix fix menu. There were 3 of us so we got to try pretty much everything!\n\nStarters:\nPotato and leek soup - I really enjoyed this soup. It had a very down home feel to it and it was nice to dip our bread into. I can't say that I would order this on a normal day but it was definitely tasty.\n\nArugula salad: I'm usually not a fan of arugula. I guess I like more hardy salads. However, the salad had a great taste to it and the dressing was very nice.\n\nButter lettuce salad: Definitely my favorite! The salad was bustling with flavor from the apples, bleu cheese and walnuts. The dressing was quite nice as well. I would definitely order this again.\n\nSecond course: \nAhi tuna: This was another one of my favorites. The tuna was super soft and almost buttery, it tasted very nice and fresh. The plate was presented very nicely. In every scoop I was able to get some tuna, seaweed salad and avocado. Definitely must order this dish!\n\nSalmon carpaccio: This was also very tasty. It didn't stand out as much as the tuna but nonetheless was a great dish.\n\nMussels: The mussels were very tasty. I did wish that the broth was a lot warmer (temperature wise) But other than that it had great flavor and was a great size to share.\n\nFinal course:\n\nChicken and mashed potatoes: This was my choice and I was not let down. The chicken was nice and moist and had a great, light sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were my favorite! They were creamy and the perfect consistency. I'm talking like grandma's thanksgiving mashed potatoes caliber!\n\nLamb: I'm not a huge fan of lamb and the dish had olives which i'm also not very keen of. Also, the lamb tasted a little tough. \n\nDuck: The duck was very yummy. It wasn't too fatty tasting and it laid on top of a very tasty sauce. I would definitely order it again.\n\nDessert:\n\nI'm not big on desserts. However, I loved the grapefruit shaved ice thing! (I think it had a fancier name than that) it was nice and tangy and very refreshing for my palate after our hearty meal. My friends were pretty obsessed with the ice cream as well.\n\nAll in all, great restaurant! The service is good. I did notice that sometimes the servers were a little too eager to take your plate. I will definitely be coming back!\n\nI read on the menu that they do a Prix-Fix menu every week so I would definitely recommend coming and doing that with people to share.

Reminds me of my favorite Gorgonzola and pear salad.\nArugula Salad: Nice and refreshing for the summer time with the fruit pieces.\n\nSecond course:\nOrganic Loch Duart: Delicious and refreshing. I think they used smoke salmon for this plate.\nYellowfin tuna: Taste like your typical tuna tartare stacked.\nSteamed PEI mussels: Its really hard not to mess up on this dish but loved every single bite. The restaurant gives out sourdough bread so ask for extra to dip the sauce!\nBaked goat cheese: One of my favorite plates here. Super smooth and creamy.\n \nThird coourse:\nSeared scallops: Fresh, firm scallops. Sweet and simple herbs to enhance the scallop flavors.\nFlat iron steak: Medium rare as always. Tender but its a bit dry. Thank goodness for the wine reduction for dip\nLamb tenders: One of my least favorite as the lamb has a slight odor to it. Not very fresh in my opinion. Very chewy. \n\nWe had a side order of foie gras: My first taste, just as I suspected from my research. Slightly seared but still as soft and buttery. \n\nFourth course:\nSemifreddo all'amareto: Love the taste of the almond ice cream. \nVanilla bean creme brulee: So smooth and light for a creme brulee. A must have.\nBuche Au Lait De Chevre: Not my choice for dessert but yes for charcuterie.\nPoint Reyes Blue Cheese with fruits: Again not my choice for dessert.\n\nMy overall experience here is delightful.

They encourage family style, i.e. share your food, but that's totally up to the diners. The potato leek soup was actually my fave..piping hot, truffle oil, potato starchy creaminess, and the bacon!! I'm a sucker for potato leek soup but Isa's has more depth of flavors than I have had in the past from other restaurants. Butter lettuce salad wasn't memorable, butter lettuce, some crumbles of blue cheese, vinaigrette& pear slices.\n\n2nd course: tuna avocado thing that very much tasted like poke to me with some seaweed salad as the base..wait a minute, it is tuna poke deconstructed in a sense...enjoyable as the tuna was fresh. Salmon carpaccio was a miss for me, it was lacking flavor & the creme fraiche drizzle (thank you for a light drizzle) wasn't really necessary...i guess cause i'm not a huge creme fraiche, white creamy sauce kind of person (gag). The mussels was ohkay, broth was yummy but mussel meat were teeny tiny..it shrank alot! Then again, that's my gripe about PEI mussels..Isa--contact Cuisinett Restaurant in San Carlos about which mussel farm they get their mussels from (apparently some farm from British Columbia, Canada) because their mussels are MEATY!\n\n3rd course: Seared scallops were made perfectly, soft & tender but only 3 scallops to a mountain of mashed potatoes...wish there were 4 scallops. Flat iron steak made rare, wow...so tender I didn't even need to use the steak knife they gave us. And I made sure I smeared that tarragon butter ALL over the slices including the fingerling potatoes which were MADE PERFECTLY too! So perfectly flavored. Duck breast was delicious too, the end pcs of the duck breast without any of the sauce touching had such a crispy skin that it tasted like pork cracklins! the other parts of the breast were just as tasty too...all of us very much enjoyed most of our 3rd courses with the exception of the mashed potato ratio to scallops. I looked over other diner's table who ordered the pan roasted chicken & that looked tasty too.\n\n4th course: grapefruit granite was refreshing & definitely tasted like real deal grapefruit. You can definitely taste the pith bitterness in it but that's expected as I am sure they used real grapefruit to make it..no artificial flavors there! The goat cheese w/honey paired very well together. The amaretto semifreddo was our least favorite..it was almond ice cream but it was too much almond. It's tasted like almond extract upon crushed almond in the ice cream & almond cookies...it wasn't our fave amongst the three. \n\nIt was a lot of food & amazingly, I was just right!

The lean protein with the avocado and seaweed salad was the perfect combo.\n\nAt this point we were getting full but more kept coming! We had the braised short rib with broccolini and buttery mashed potatoes. The mash was really good but the short rib was melt in your mouth delicious.

I asked for medium rare but it came out a little too done on the exterior for my taste. Still tasted good but a bit chewy.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of ISA, at first i thought it was a bit dark but that was only the area near the bar, in the back it had a nice and cozy. It can best be described as a Patio that had a roof dropped on it. The ladies and I decided to take advantage of Isa's prix fix. You can't beat 3 courses for 29 bucks, especially since ISA's normal menu prices will make your tummy happy but wallet very sad.\n\nAll the items on the Prix fix sounded delicious .  The ladies and i decided to do it up family style so we could fully experience ISA. For appetizers we ordered The Heirloom Tomato salad, the butter lettuce salad and the grilled calamari. \n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad was simple yet very delicious. A layout of 4 different heirloom tomatoes on a bed of arugula with feta, basil and what tasted like crouton crumbs. Drizzled on top was a balsamic vinaigrette.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O8_jDhc7WJXqdD9YgEXSRw/l\n\nButter lettuce salad was giant lettuce leaves with slices of Bartlett pear, candied walnuts, roaring fourty's blue cheese and watercress. Another fairly simple salad with a nice different taste.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IFOxOZejHWxYbQERk9BUNQ/l\n\nGrilled Calamari was amazing, we all agree whenever we think of calamari we think FRIED! Grilled Calamari is a very good alternative if made right!! Isa's was spot on!  mmm tentacles, my favorite part ;) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gtt3cE-PM9-kvrkwt1hsrQ/l\n\nThe main courses we chose were the Halibut, Flat Iron Steak and Free Range Chicken:\n\nThe Halibut came out first, its was simply captivating. With its crisp exterior and soft center it was cooked to perfection. There's almost no way we can make this at home!! What's their secret???? seriously! I would eat  fish more frequently if i could make it this perfect at home. Another thing that made this dish the best of the nite was the mix of the other ingredients gave it a totally different flavor from what i am used to. I love beets but hate prepping them for anything, cuz they stain everything! the orange slices were a nice touch and the orange vinaigrette was a great finish.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OID21xWn91M0gH9x34RzIg/l\n\nFlat Iron Steak with zucchini and potatoes was also cooked perfectly, the steak was tender and juicy, the zucchini had good flavor and the potatoes  mmmm MMMmmmm is all i can say. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vZIJ18tvYZ0h4YDWf3mRVw/l\n\nFree Range Chicken: One breast and one thigh was prepped with a lot of spices which in turn make it very flavorful and delightful. Normally the mash potatoes i make or like usually has lumps it in. Isa's mashed potatoes were creamed to perfect....taste that butter...yum.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XmRjgJ1RWl8yDa0T7KXeOQ/l\n\n\nFor Dessert it was a pic from two different cheese plates, Semifreddo all' Amaretto and the Grapefruit Granite\n\nThe ladies both opted out for the Semifreddo and i decided to be the odd one out and get the Grapefruit Granite. \n\nThe Semifreddo: The texture seemed like ice cream but not as creamy and heavy. The plate was lined with hollow almond cookies, very fresh and yummy.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0RacKXy674IyZUbIGsSWGQ/l\n\nThe Granite didn't strike me as anything special, it was basically Grapefruit shaved ice to me. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y-3xPJ-u91kBPq3iNDOWtQ/l\n\n\nBest Monday ever,  Janice L and Karen Y!!! Thanks Ladies ;)\n\n\n\n*semifreddo: is a semi frozen dessert (ice cream cake, semi frozen custard, fruit tarts) it has a moose like texture because they are uniting two equal parts of ice cream and whipped cream.\n\n*Granite: combining some sort of fruit juice with boiling water and fine sugar.

Hostess gave us updates and options. Waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. Service was on point. \n\nFOOD: Isa has a prix fixe menu regularly. The DAT menu is actually 6 apps, 7 entrees, 4 desserts. The dishes are great for sharing. \n\nAppetizers (salmon carpaccio, dugeness crab salad, butter lettuce salad, arugula salad, Laura chenel goat cheese, PEI mussels) -- I recommend everything but the crab salad -- the weakest dish on the appetizer list. Might have been better if it came out before the stronger flavored dishes.\n\nSecond Course (scallops, seasonal fish, spaghetti, truffle risotto, range chicken, duck breast, flat iron steak)-- we have everything but the steak and doubled up on the duck breast. \nSeasonal fish is petrale sole. Everything was excellent. I don't normally order spaghetti or risotto, but like William Hung, I have no regrets at all. Each plate was very hearty -- the duck breast was one of the bigger plates. \n\nThird Course (Grapefruit granite, semifreddo all'amaretto, vanilla bean gelato, vanilla bean creme brulee) -- we had everything but the grapefruit. Semifreddo is very almondy, if you're into that, and goes well with expresso. \n\nPRICE: Prix fixe ~$35. Mix drinks $8-9. Tip included for larger parties. Damper -- they have a 3 course prix fixe for $29. I am sure the DAT is a better deal... I hope.\n\nTIPS: Make reservations early. Parking can get difficult. Isa has parking reservation service but we didn't try it. Happy hour before 7pm -- $5 drinks. Free wine glass per prix fixe Sun-Thurs. Choices for vegetarians were delicious! Kitchen is small -- our dishes came out a few at a time which was great for sharing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Definitely a good choice for DAT. Great choice if you have a vegetarian friend.

Found ourselves perhaps or at least continued to strive to do so.\n\nAnd for this, Isa has truly persisted to be, through the years, my favorite restaurant in the San Francisco.  No place feels quite so much like home yet dazzles  afresh every time.\n\nI will never stop ordering the baked butterfish and the butter lettuce salad (hmm... pattern?).  I will definitely start ordering the baked goat cheese and mussels.

Food was solid all around and $40 was a pretty reasonable price. Made a reservation for a Sunday night for an early-ish dinner. We were seated right away and service was very friendly throughout the night.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the following items:\n1) Potato & Leak Soup w/ cream/truffle oil/chives: Friends 1st course from RW. Decent soup. Light and smooth though a bit heavy handed on the truffle oil which I didn't feel was very necessary in the first place. (3.25/5)\n\n2) Arugula Salad: My 1st Course for RW. A simple semi classic salad. Light vinegary dressing w/ some fresh fruits and some extra crunch from the fennel + a bit of nutty cheese. Can't go wrong. (3.5/5)\n\n3) Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio: My 2nd Course for RW: Another very classic dish. The main \"unique\" angle of this dish was the egg which honestly didn't stand out much. Salmon quality was decent (though personally wish it was a bit colder/firmer). Could've used some other flavor to make it standout but it's fine all around (3.5/5)\n\n4) Duck breast: My 3rd course for RW. One of the better dishes off the RW menu in my opinion. There isn't a flavor that blew my mind but it was good. Duck breast was very moist and tender (though would've liked a bit more sear on the fat) with just the right amount of fat. I wasn't a huge fan of the golden beets/spinach combination. The beets were soft and had a sweet earthy flavor but the chunks were too large. The spinach also didn't hold up to the other flavors and textures. The tangy goat cheese went well with the beets though. The huckleberry sauce went well with the duck. (3.75/5)\n\n5) Truffle Risotto: Friend's 3rd course. Had a bite. Not much to say. It's about as basic of a risotto as you can get from a semi-nice place. Pretty creamy and some mushroom flavor though. Not bad but there's better options (like the duck) (3.25/5)\n\n6) Foie Gras & Fruit Pairing: A $25 side option and the best item of the night. A very sizeable, solid piece of foie gras. Perfect sear, very fatty, and paired w/ some delicious pears and toasted almost custard-like bread. (4.75/5)\n\n7) Bucherondin De Chevre paired w/ a star-anise honey & walnuts: A lovely way to end the dinner. A semi-pungent goat cheese w/ a light amount of honey and some walnuts for crunch. Honey could have used a bit more of the anise flavor but then again it's all about that cheese (4.5/5)\n\nOverall, I left very happy with my meal. I do feel like my friend's options were a bit more underwhelming so I can't say how consistent this place is but they definitely have some good options that are worth the price.

However, we were not seated until 9-910pm. We had plenty of time to look over the menu as we were waiting. Ordered right when we were seated. It was a four course meal. \n\nFirst course: We ordered three potato and leek soup and a arugula salad. Also, ordered a dozen oysters. The soup arrived first with bread and butter. The three soups were almost finished and we decided to ask our waiter for the status of the salad. Waiter's response was, \"we will bring it out when the kitchen is done with it.\" One of our second course dish came out and I asked our waiter about the salad that never came. To my surprise, he came inches away from my face and said, \"I TOLD YOU, WE WILL BRING IT OUT WHEN THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point, I'm in total shock. I have never ever in my life had a waiter get in my face like that. I sat there in disbelief and did not say a word. Luckily, my best friend who was sitting in front of me questioned the waiter about his rudeness. We had asked the manager of the restaurant for a new waiter. That kind of behavior and customer service is unacceptable. \n\nSecond course: I recommend the mussels and the goat cheese. Both were really good and had a lot of flavor. We also tried to salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. Not as good as it sounds. Also, as our waiter was serving our dishes, he knocked down a glass of wine on my best friend across from me. The entire restaurant went quiet as we all watch her wipe off all the wine that was on her face, neck, and shirt! The waiter was really apologetic and he seemed to be very sincere and genuine with his apology. It was truly an accident, and we didn't want to make him feel worst than he probably already feels about spilling the wine. We said it was totally okay and that he didn't have to keep apologizing. \n\nThird course: Seared scallops with bacon and mashed potatoes was a hit. Super good! I would also recommend the truffle risotto. We also ordered the seasonal fish with spinach. Fish was really bland, but the spinach was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the angus flat iron steak came. My friend took a bite from the steak and it was cold. Not warm but COLD. It was probably sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it was served to us. We mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter responded with, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? Is this a new thing where steak is served cold?? The was absolutely the last straw for everyone at our table. Waiter took the plate back in to the kitchen and brought it back a few moments later. The pieces of steak that were moved when my friend tried to eat it was at the same placement when the waiter had brought it back to the kitchen. We figured they just microwaved it and brought it back. We barely ate the steak and asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. \n\nFourth course: While waiting for our dessert, our bill came. Waiter came back and wanted to know why we didn't want dessert. They must've misunderstood us, because we had asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. Due to the confusion, we probably had to wait another 15-20 minutes for some darn ice cream and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nThis has got to be the worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant.

What was upsetting was that when we received the final bill, AT THE VERY LEAST they could have comped that ONE glass of wine.\n\nAlso, our very last third course served was the steak. I was the first one to try a piece and when I bit into a small piece, the steak was COLD. Not cool, but actually COLD. I flagged down a server and told him that the steak was cold and no lie, I'm going to quote verbatim again. He says, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" I was AGAIN so shocked that I actually had to stuttered out \"to cook it?\"\n\nAt this point, we all are so upset that we asked for our check so that we can leave ASAP.

The restaurant enters a dim-lit dining area as you're taken through the back. It's a covered outdoor backyard with strings of lights and heated lamps. There's plants hanging all around to give a cozy and romantic ambiance with an outdoor feel. I was head over heels with their d\u00e9cor of the restaurant.

The 4-course restaurant week started off with a Smooth Potato Leek Soup and Arugula Salad. Both were decent, but the salad lacked some flavor. Second course was the Yellowfin Tuna and Organic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio. As a huge fan of raw fish, I loved both of these dishes. The only problem was that I was not too hungry coming in for dinner, so we were both pretty stuffed by this point.\n\nThe main course was the Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast and Grilled Golden Gate Natural Flat Iron Steak. Both of them came with a side of greens: steak with zucchini and potatoes/duck with spinach and beets. Both dishes were very solid and tasty, but I think I was way too stuffed to enjoy any more of it. Thankfully we decided to boxed these up and move onto our dessert. We finished with the Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee and Buche Au Lait De Crevre Aged Goat Cheese. The date loved the goat cheese while I indulged myself in the cr\u00e8me brulee.

We asked for the manager, she apologized and gave us a new waiter.\n\nMoving on we received the next dishes and as the new waiter drops off the food he knocks down my full glass of red wine and I am completely showered in it.

We weren't mad at the server because it was a complete accident and he was totally sincere and apologetic.

We told one of the other servers and he asked us \"So what do you want me to do about it?\" LOL. TBH at this point I'm not sure why we stayed though out the dinner. The steak was returned on the same plate and was basically microwaved since food placement was the same on the plate.\n\nWe asked for the bill while we waited for the dessert and told them we just want to be out of here after we eat our dessert. Somehow they misunderstood us when it was clearly stated we were still waiting for dessert. We wanted to be able to leave right away once we finished dessert.

Only our wine was offered to be comp'd after my friend decided to speak to the manager... She offered her phone number & to personally serve us the next time but what does personally serving us change anything?

Wonderful to dip bread in! \n\nSecond Course\nBaked Goat Cheese: This one took a while to come out because baking takes a while, but I recommend this for people who love goat cheese (and pizza!) It tasted more like a pizza without the crust, so I naturally used the bread that came with the meal as a dipping tool. \nYellowfin Tuna: My boyfriend ordered this and said it was comparable for the price point with an almost identical Yellowfin Tuna dish from Jean-Georges. Even though he's not a big fan of seafood, he thought it was prepared very well.\n\nThird Course \nTruffle Risotto: yummm mushroom overload! Although, compared to other same-tier restaurants I've been to for RW, the truffle flavor wasn't as flavorful as others. Still very delicious though.\nAngus flat iron steak: The waiter recommended medium-rare which is what my bf got, but he thinks it would have been overall if it was just cooked medium. This is more of a preference thing though.\n\nFourth Course\nGrapefruit Granite: This was a very tarty grapefruit shaved ice, and while it was good, it didn't wow me since shaved ice can only impress so much. Our waiter recommended that we eat this dessert first since the flavor is much stronger than the other. \nSemifreddo all'amaretto: This dessert was fantastic! The flavors are not overwhelmingly sweet like I expected it to be, and all the flavors worked so well together that it felt like a light ice cream cake. I've actually never had semifreddo before and omg I can eat this forever.\n\nOVERALL\nFantastic experience, service, ambiance. It was so cozy on a rainy day, and we loved every minute of our dining experience.

I ordered the Greyhound Soju cocktail which was pretty sweeth and yummy and had just enough to kick. Since it was Restaurant week we had a prix fix menu. There were 3 of us so we got to try pretty much everything!\n\nStarters:\nPotato and leek soup - I really enjoyed this soup. It had a very down home feel to it and it was nice to dip our bread into. I can't say that I would order this on a normal day but it was definitely tasty.\n\nArugula salad: I'm usually not a fan of arugula. I guess I like more hardy salads. However, the salad had a great taste to it and the dressing was very nice.\n\nButter lettuce salad: Definitely my favorite! The salad was bustling with flavor from the apples, bleu cheese and walnuts. The dressing was quite nice as well. I would definitely order this again.\n\nSecond course: \nAhi tuna: This was another one of my favorites. The tuna was super soft and almost buttery, it tasted very nice and fresh. The plate was presented very nicely. In every scoop I was able to get some tuna, seaweed salad and avocado. Definitely must order this dish!\n\nSalmon carpaccio: This was also very tasty. It didn't stand out as much as the tuna but nonetheless was a great dish.\n\nMussels: The mussels were very tasty. I did wish that the broth was a lot warmer (temperature wise) But other than that it had great flavor and was a great size to share.\n\nFinal course:\n\nChicken and mashed potatoes: This was my choice and I was not let down. The chicken was nice and moist and had a great, light sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were my favorite! They were creamy and the perfect consistency. I'm talking like grandma's thanksgiving mashed potatoes caliber!\n\nLamb: I'm not a huge fan of lamb and the dish had olives which i'm also not very keen of. Also, the lamb tasted a little tough. \n\nDuck: The duck was very yummy. It wasn't too fatty tasting and it laid on top of a very tasty sauce. I would definitely order it again.\n\nDessert:\n\nI'm not big on desserts. However, I loved the grapefruit shaved ice thing! (I think it had a fancier name than that) it was nice and tangy and very refreshing for my palate after our hearty meal. My friends were pretty obsessed with the ice cream as well.\n\nAll in all, great restaurant! The service is good. I did notice that sometimes the servers were a little too eager to take your plate. I will definitely be coming back!\n\nI read on the menu that they do a Prix-Fix menu every week so I would definitely recommend coming and doing that with people to share.

Super smooth and creamy.\n \nThird coourse:\nSeared scallops: Fresh, firm scallops. Sweet and simple herbs to enhance the scallop flavors.\nFlat iron steak: Medium rare as always.

The next thing that showed up was my coworker's salmon carpaccio (think that's what it was called) and that was super good! It had eggs and cucumber with it along with pieces of smoked salmon with a crustini. Yum! Before my yellow fin tuna came out, my risotto came out. Now, I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but it was a truffle risotto and of course I had to get it! Anything truffle, I'm ok with it...just other mushrooms makes me gag. Tried it and you get this heavy truffle taste along with parmesan . Yum! (Can I say, by this time I've engorged myself with so much bread and butter that I'm super stuffed!) But still, I couldn't help myself in scooping more risotto onto my plate. \n\nAfter that, the yellowfin tuna came out and it's of course, all raw. (Just realized that most everything we ordered were raw...hah) This was really delicious! The bottom had some avocado and drenched with some sriracha. Yum!  The combination gave me this heavy and spicy feeling and matched with the tuna, it was amazing! (Not sure if my description makes sense. hah)\n\nThen, onto the duck my coworker ordered. This was my least favorite...I'm not much of a duck person but it was pretty good. This...was also cooked a little raw (i never knew you could eat duck raw!) Maybe it was my mentality but eating it raw kinda make me go...ehh...no. For some reason, anything that's a bird and raw makes me scared because of chicken.

But since j can't have that all the time, this will do in a pinch. It's REALLY good. My boyfriend got the mussels which were TINY with not a lot of broth, but were perfectly cooked. Wish they used bigger mussels though. I got the truffle risotto for my entree and my boyfriend got  the steak. We liked both a lot, though the truffle risotto should be called a mushroom risotto as the flavour overwhelms it. There are a lot of bits of truffles throughout the risotto though, which I REAAAAALLY liked. I can't really comment on my BF's steak as I only had a bite, but the veggies were cooked wel and deliciously seasoned. Yum :)\n\nOur dessert was the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which came out in small ramekins, but was delighted to see that they use vanilla bean (speckles galore!) and that each br\u00fbl\u00e9e had an amazing caramelised crust.\n\nAll in all, super busy restaurant with attentive service that could have only been improved by serving higher quality ingredients and perhaps the service would have been more attentive had the restaurant not been PACKED.

The vanilla brulee was sweet and creamy and the caramelization gave it that nice crunch. The semifreddo had a more subtle sweetness and a nutty flavor.

Although it looks small on the outside, there is ample seating inside, a full bar, and a beautiful outdoor patio sort of seating area. The seating area outside is full of lamp heaters, so unlike other places where you are only warm if you are right next to one of the heaters, the whole seating area was warm and cozy! The patio was lit with beautiful lights and just instantly made you feel at home and comfortable. \n\nService: Again, impeccable! Our server was kind and explained all the different menu items to us, especially because many of them had french words in the titles. Our food came out at perfect intervals, with one exception. My sister got her main course atleast 10 minutes before I got mine, which wasn't a big deal since we shared everything anyways. The only thing that came very late was my mojito that I ordered right when I got inside ($5 cocktails before 7pm, yes please!). The mojito came after the bread and the salad course, so it took quite a bit of time. Besides that, our waiter was charming and sweet! \n\nFood: \nSoup: Smooth Potato and Leek Soup with parsley, chives & cream --This was a nice soup to get started with. I've never had potato and leek soup, so it was different. I wish it was a little more flavorful (read: more salty or even spicy) but it was nice to dip the bread in. \nSalad: Arugula salad with fuji apples, persimmon, fennel, lemon vinaigrette & parmesan --This was delicious! I loved the flavors of the vinagrette with the fruits and arugula is my favorite, so I devoured this salad!\nMain Course: \n1. Truffle risotto with baby shiitake, hon shimiji mushroom & reggiano --I loved the baby shiitake mushrooms in this dish, added so much texture and flavor! The risotto was a little bland for my taste. Not sure if this is because the flavors from the salad were so powerful, but the risotto needed more seasoning and again, salt or spices. Something to give it direction perhaps? Not a bad dish, just not something I would order again. \n2.  Spaghetti with himalayan truffles, tomatoes, basil & parmesan cheese -- Very simple spaghetti dish. I guess you can't make spaghetti that amazing since it is a pretty simple dish, but the marinara sauce was definitely more flavorful than the risotto or soup dishes that I had previously, so I enjoyed that! \nDessert:  Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e -- MMM still dreaming about this dessert. The top was crisp and golden brown, and below was the creamiest, mousse type vanilla pudding. I was in love. Although I was so so full after the risotto, my creme brulee disappeared in minutes. \n\nVerdict: I would say the food was 3.5 stars, probably because although this was the most vegetarian friendly and appetizing looking menu for me, the dishes did not have as much promise. The risotto needed more flavor and the spaghetti was very simple. So I'd say it's party because it's a French restaurant, so their specialty isn't making delicious vegetarian dishes but rather more meat based ones.

Definitely my favorite dish of the night! The mussels were also very tasty, more so for the broth. We enjoyed dipping our bread to finish off the broth. The oysters were also brought in around this time, and served with a simple sauce and dash of lemon, they were also delicious .The oysters were smaller than the usual oysters around the area-- the waiter explained to us they were Little Skookum oysters from Seattle. Yum! Now, we were already starting to get a bit full, but we had two courses left. Third course included the truffle risotto and maple leaf farm duck breast. The truffle risotto was thick and rich, and the duck breast was soft and flavored with huckleberry sauce. These two dishes were more savory and filling, and we had to pack both home as we were stuffed! However, no matter how full we are, there's always room for dessert. My friend and I joked how we have two stomachs: one for dinner and one for dessert. Our dessert stomachs were empty and ready for deliciousness. We ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee and Buche Au Lait De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey and walnuts.)

The entree with goat cheese was unique though in my opinion: a slice of bread lathered with rich goat cheese and sprinkled with honeyed walnuts. I'm not usually a huge fan of cheese, but I have to admit this was awesome. \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful experience at Isa.

The fish had a lovely, salty panko-like crust on the top, with zucchini, tomatoes, olives, and what I think were artichokes on the bottom. The vegetables were also delicious, seeing that my family was fighting to get the veggies. \nThe truffle risotto is a different story. Oh, my god it was so savory-- it was comfy like comfort food but still refined like fine wine. \n\nThe other dishes we ordered were so-so.

The DAT menu is actually 6 apps, 7 entrees, 4 desserts. The dishes are great for sharing. \n\nAppetizers (salmon carpaccio, dugeness crab salad, butter lettuce salad, arugula salad, Laura chenel goat cheese, PEI mussels) -- I recommend everything but the crab salad -- the weakest dish on the appetizer list. Might have been better if it came out before the stronger flavored dishes.\n\nSecond Course (scallops, seasonal fish, spaghetti, truffle risotto, range chicken, duck breast, flat iron steak)-- we have everything but the steak and doubled up on the duck breast. \nSeasonal fish is petrale sole. Everything was excellent. I don't normally order spaghetti or risotto, but like William Hung, I have no regrets at all. Each plate was very hearty -- the duck breast was one of the bigger plates. \n\nThird Course (Grapefruit granite, semifreddo all'amaretto, vanilla bean gelato, vanilla bean creme brulee) -- we had everything but the grapefruit. Semifreddo is very almondy, if you're into that, and goes well with expresso. \n\nPRICE: Prix fixe ~$35. Mix drinks $8-9. Tip included for larger parties. Damper -- they have a 3 course prix fixe for $29. I am sure the DAT is a better deal... I hope.\n\nTIPS: Make reservations early. Parking can get difficult. Isa has parking reservation service but we didn't try it. Happy hour before 7pm -- $5 drinks. Free wine glass per prix fixe Sun-Thurs. Choices for vegetarians were delicious! Kitchen is small -- our dishes came out a few at a time which was great for sharing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Definitely a good choice for DAT. Great choice if you have a vegetarian friend.

I paid $40.57 (actually, come to think of it, I accidentally paid $40.52, but that's a small error.) The guy picking up the tab asked if I was set, and I misunderstanding what they were asking, said yes. Then my waiter noticed I was still sitting there and asked if I was waiting for change. (Props for a perceptive waiter! At the other place this happened they forgot about my existence.) When the change came, it came for $40. Not a big deal for this size of check, but mildly annoying. But it's the same thing that happened at the other place. As if they had to reconstruct what had happened once they realized I wasn't leaving the entire amount as payment + tip, and no longer remembered that there was change with the check.\n\nI suspect it was my leaving the change that threw them off. So I guess I'll stop doing that and find a way to get rid of my change elsewhere.\n\nAs for how to avoid the problem in the first place, restaurants would do well to say \"I'll bring your change\" and leave it to the customer to say, \"No, I'm set\" if they mean to leave the entire return amount as tip.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-11-11"}, {"excerpts": ["From sneaking a look at my neighbors, the arugula salad also looks amazing.

The mashed potatoes that came with it were smooth and buttery. The flat iron steak was nice and rare, with roasted potatoes and green beans. The steak, while good, did not stand up to the chicken.\n\nFor dessert, we had the creme brulee and the semifreddo.

It was definitely good.  However, I have to disclaim that it is the only foie gras I have ever tried, so I don't have much to compare it to.  Regardless, once I got past the initial disgust of how fatty foie gras is, being warm, sweet, and creamy, it was absolutely delicious.  \n\nI was surprised by the sea bass because it did not taste like fish, nor did it have the normal texture of fish.  The flavor was neutral and the texture was firm.  In fact, my friend who \"doesn't like seafood\" was enjoying it (he thought it was chicken) until I told him it was fish.  I was a little disappointed with it, though, because I didn't think it was very flavorful.  \n\nPork chops are one of my all time favorite foods.  The flavor of this one was good, but it was definitely over cooked and therefore dry and tough.  \n\nRack of lamb is one of my other all time favorite foods.

The portions were a good size, just a touch smaller than their usual portions.

It was very good, but I wouldn't normally order this at a French restaurant.\n\n$16 Dungeness Crab Salad w/ avocado, apples, grapefruit & tarragon:\nThe shredded crab was not too shredded and the pieces were still substantial enough to be satisfying. The avocado, apple slices, and grapefruit each added variations in texture, and some tart and sweet flavors to the mix.\n\n$24 Seared Scallops w/ mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon & truffle sauce:\nScallops were seared just right with a browned surface, but still had a meaty and springy texture. Brussel sprouts were roasted to a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were so good with the savory sauce.\n\n$23 Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce:\nThe slices of flat iron were juicy and tender. The sauce on top was like a chimichurri, good flavor, but could have used more of it.\n\n$7 Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: \nCreme brulee isn't my favorite dessert. I still do enjoy taking a spoon and giving the torched caramelized crust a whack and seeing the broken window effect. Surprisingly it didn't break, as it was a rather thick crust. The custard underneath was nice and smooth.\n\n$7 Semifreddo all' Amaretto:\nI didn't know what to make of this semifreddo. I've had semifreddos before, but this seemed like half ice cream and half frozen bread. At least that was the texture that came to my mind. The almond cookies were good. I don't care for presentation or garnishes, but in this case, the sprig of mint was much needed to make this dish look good.\n\nNow that I think about it, I probably would enjoy the grapefruit granite. I wonder why I never tried it. \n\nThe chef has quite an impressive resume. I can see how he's going for a Californian Provencal menu, but most of the dishes seem more Californian to me.\nWould I eat here again? Since I've tried the above dishes, there's not much on the prix fix menu that intrigues me, except maybe the salmon carpaccio or the truffle risotto. I am interested in trying the foie gras though.

I did not mind though because I was already happy to get a reservation. Then, one friend couldn't make it so I changed the reservation back to 2 people (I know, annoying).

I was afraid they would say something to us around 6:30pm, but 6:30pm came and went and nobody rushed us or made us feel like we had to leave at any certain time.

They joked around with us and talked to us which is a thumbs up because it showed me they were attentive and wants the customers to feel welcomed and relaxed. \n\nWe had 4 orders of the Maine Lobster Broth, one Grilled Local Calamari, and one tomato dish with goat cheese. The soup of the Lobster broth was better tasting than the shrimp that comes with it. The grilled calamari was something different than having the usual fried calamari but it was delicious and the arugula that came with it was even more yummy to me! The tomato appetizer we had, had super sweet tomatoes that came with a crouton-like pieces which added a unique experience to tomatoes which were soft with a crunchy side to it.\n\nFor the entree among 6 people with a family-styled dinner, we had two orders of the Roasted Rack of Lamb, which I am not a fan of lamb but the veggies that came alongside it were delicious! Not usually a fan of eggplants but when chopped into pieces with zucchini, red peppers, and olives, it was delicious! Had an order of Potato Wrapped Seabass, which was my favorite entree dish! Flavorful and delicious when paired with potatoes! The last order we had was the Grilled Golden Gage Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak. The steak was well-done and a bit dry, but the zucchini was good and the flavor was very tasty. Four entrees with three different appetizers, we were definitely full, but not too full, meaning we had room for desserts!\n\nWe ordered two Vanilla Bean Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, one Flourless Chocolate Cake with vanilla bean gelato, and one order of the Semifreddo All Amaretto. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good because it wasn't too sweet, but tasteful enough to enjoy. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was my favorite because it was paired with vanilla bean gelato which tasted super good! Not a fan of the amaretto taste, but I really enjoyed the little cookie pieces inside the ice cream.\n\nOverall, good meal. Will be back because I didn't get to try the Dungeness Crab Salad and Organic Loch Duart Calmon Carpaccio. The service was excellent. The wine had a nice aroma to it even though I'm not a red wine fan. Ordered a bottle to pair with the meal, which was nice. Had a lot of wine options and even offered some soju cocktails.

One of the reasons I chose Isa out of all the other restaurants was because they offer four courses instead of three like most of the other restaurants on the list. (Foodie much? Yes. Must eat ALL the foods.) \n\nThe restaurant is really pretty. We were led to the back where it's decorated like an outside patio. The lights were dimmed and there were white Christmas lights hung across. Ah it was romantic and intimate. Perfect mood for a date. \n\nFirst course\nCorn soup: Honestly can't remember much about this.\nMaine Lobster Broth: It was rich in flavor and had a few pieces of lobster to chew on. Simple but very flavorful. \n\nSecond course\nSalmon Carpaccio: Omgosh, this dish was de-LICIOUS. I don't remember exactly what our waiter said but it was something along the lines of the salmon not being sold on the market and it's imported from another country. Yes..something like that. Whether I remember correctly or not, I can for sure tell you that salmon was out of this world. Yum! Definitely recommend this dish. \nYellowfin Tuna: This was just as delicious as the salmon carpaccio. If you like raw fish, both of these dishes are perfect for a second course. \n\nThird course\nTruffle Risotto: ABSOLUTELY recommend this dish! If you like truffle, you will love this dish. It's rich in flavor and very heavy so we couldn't eat much of it at once. \nFlat Iron Steak: This was a good choice as well. The steak was grilled to perfection (medium rare) and it went well with the zucchini and roasted potatoes.\n\nFourth course\nWe had the Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e and Semifreddo all' amaretto.

The Truffle Risotto was amazing. The texture of the risotto was just right, and the mushrooms were delectable. It reminded me very much of Lupa Trattoria's Fettuccine Tartufate, which is just about my absolute favorite pasta dish that I've had in all my 25 years of life (but that's a review for another time). The Flat Iron Steak was also very delicious, and reminded me of the steak frites from Le Relais de l'Entrec\u00f4te in Paris since the moutarde verte that they topped the steak with is very similar to the ones from Le Relais. You can also choose other side dishes to come with the steak, but I highly recommend sticking to the moutarde verte. You can't go wrong! \n\nFor dessert I ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake. This is probably my one disappointment, but only because I was expecting a very dense chocolate cake like the ones they serve at The House (which is mindblowingly amazing). I could tell that the cake was straight out of the oven though as it was piping hot and incredibly fresh. It was a more spongy cake than I would have liked, but it was served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and I enjoyed myself despite my expectations.\n\nOverall, this restaurant just shot up to one of my top 5 places to eat in San Francisco, and I have lived here for 4 years now.

No need to bust out your finest suits and dresses, but a nice top/skirt combo or dress would be appropriate for ladies.  \n\nThe (very long) deets of the eats:\n+ Bread: Delicious and, as other Yelpers have noted, endless!

The restaurant itself.\n\nReservations for 8:15 pm, half our party arrived around 8:25 - they didn't even blink. Nice. Sat the PROMPT half (ahem) at around 8:30, and when everyone was finally accounted for, we ordered around 9 pm. Meanwhile, there's yummy house bread (2 baskets for 5 people!) (yes, 2.5 of us were prompt, and 2.5 were tardy) (it is possible) with super smooth creamy butter on the side. Also, they sat us \"outside\" which is basically inside but with this heavy burlap canvas tent encasing us \"inside\" and they had those fire towers that give off A TON of heat. It was burning my neck so I asked the waiter to please turn it down, and he totally did. That was so nice. Thanks lover!\n\nHere are the dishes we ordered:\n\n      Dungeness Crab Salad\n      13\n\nThis is TINY. Like a tumor in a baby tiny. Like a roll of Scotch tape tiny. But it was GOOD. The crab meat were plump and juicy and the grapefruit/avocado bed the crab was laid in was velvety rich and creamy. WAY TOO SMALL FOR $13 THOUGH. \n\n      Maine Lobster Broth\n      6.5\n\nWe didn't order this but hot dang if I could not smell it the whole time from my neighbors' tables tantalyzingly teasing me with its curly scents of seafood and spice.\n\n      Prince Edward Island Black Mussels\n      9.5\n\nNothing special - basically like every other bowl of mussels at every other small plates place I have ever been to. TIP: DIP YOUR HOUSE BREAD IN THE SAUCE. IT'S HECKA GOOD! It's like eating a crumbly, wheaty mussel! Except it fills you up!\n\n      Seared Dayboat Scallops\n      15.5\n\nThis was so good. It was so good I'm going to bring out the Korean and say it was SOH good! The scallops were fat and flavorful although the potato puree was basically average, which is understandable as the scallops are the main act. BUT only four scallops, no matter how big, should NEVER ever ever be $15.50. Like, ever. Unless Executive Chef Luke Sung is hand-feeding it to me.\n\n      Saffron Paella \n      13\n\nThis paella made want to shout! Throw my hands up and shout! Kick my heels back and shout! Take my pants off and shout! I am a HUGE fan of paella, and Madonna strike me dead (and a pose) if this paella wasn't done right! It was covered on top with what I can only call a THICK CRUST of assorted seafood. It was like me and my gay roommates when we used to do Facial Nights! and smear thick smotherings of seaweed and coal gook all over our faces. Except in this case, the paella is my face and the prawns, mussels, calamari, peas & red peppers is my mask! Yum to the CORE. \n\n      Shitake & Oyster Mushroom Risotto\n      13.5\n\nThis was the homely, pale, sun-starved step-sister of the paella. Bland and way too creamy. I could hardly stand it!\n\n      Pan Roasted Chicken\n      15\n\nThe crispy skin was incredible - BUT crispy chicken skin is GOOD anywhere. KFC, Popeye's, my mama's, etc. That's why it's called CRISPY. Because CRISPY is a thesaurus word for GOOD. I knows! The meat itself was a little too tough for the fact that it was $15.00 for like 1/4 of a tiny chicken. I swear, fancy schmancy restaurants never do a good job with chicken. Why? I don't know - maybe they just can't go the simple route. Executive Chef Luke Sung probably flips through an issue of Real Simple while at the checkout stand and is completely boggled out of his mind.\n\n      Maple Leaf Duck Breast\n      16\n\nI can't even begin to describe the nastiness of this dish. In fact, let me instead let Beyonce and co. sum it up: \"You nasty, you trashy! You classless, girl! You sleazy, you freaky!\" I mean I don't know anything about no fancy place but is duck supposed to be raw the way it was? It was G.R.O.S.S., y'all. I tried to eat the cooked outer edge but the texture was like chewing on 3-day old gum you found under your BART seat - flavorless, tough, and utterly disgusting. I am sorry, Executive Chef Luke Sung, dreamlover of mine, but duck should not be raw!?!?!? Right??!?!? As a consolation, I think some girl in our group liked it, but really, it wasn't for me or basically everyone else in our party.\n\nThe worst part was that the raw duck was the last dish to come, so it was like going to a really awesome club where they played great music all night, and then end with a medley of Creed songs, starting with Arms With Open. WTH? Exactly! \n\nExecutive Chef Luke Sung gets 5 stars.

My girlfriends loved the seafood paella.  I, unfortunately, am not a fan of paella.  By the time our sides (mushrooms and brussel sprouts) and steak arrived, we were all pretty stuffed.  I really had to channel my inner t-rex to finish the flat iron.  We ordered the steak medium rare and it was very tender and nicely flavored with the chimchurri sauce.

Saffron Paella i had mixed feelings about though.  I liked the fact that it was solely a \"seafood\" paella.  i am a big fan of this version than the ones w/ sausage or chicken kind.  although i was not to fond of the consistency of the rice when it was brought to our table.  Paella has nice al dente texture rice but i was looking for that part where there is a crusty top & bottom w/ chewy rice in the middle.   it would be also be nice if they presented the paella dish in a mini paella black iron pan to have that orangey saffron color contrasting w/ the black iron pan.\n\nOverall though my wife and I had a wonderful dining experience from 1st course till the 4th.

It was absolutely stellar. If this restaurant existed in Fort Worth I'd be so, so broke right now. I'm in love.\n\nIsa refers to itself as a \"Cal-French small plate\" restaurant, which is plain as day. I'm a fan of this easy description and the restaurant's lovely, fresh concept. Local California food with a French influence, served tapas style? Yes, yes, yes. I'm all in.\n\nEvery single thing we ordered looked and tasted so wonderfully complex, but the best part is that these dishes are actually so simple. No hidden ingredients. This is the kind of restaurant that doesn't have a gluten-free menu because they don't need one; all of the food descriptions are clear and our waiter was amazing with answering questions (even though I didn't really have any). He reassured me that our meals were GF. \n\nAdam and I decided to order three small plates to share. Their menu changes frequently because they only use seasonal and fresh foods, of course, but in early March we were lucky enough to have the \"Baked Laura Chenel goat cheese\" which comes with basil pesto, tomato concass\u00e9e, and pinenuts. It's served with fresh sourdough bread (Adam loved it), and I ate this incredible cheese straight with a fork. OH MY GODS. It was so perfect. I love goat cheese and Isa's presentation was gorgeous.\n\nWe also ordered the \"Grilled local calamari\" which is made with honey spice, lemon zest, and arugula; served on a bed of flageolet beans.

I wasn't freaked out though, I was in love and obsessed... simply fawning over this amazing plate. The calamari had an incredible delicate yet meaty texture, they weren't chewy at all. They were sweet and a bit tart, and the hearty beans were the perfect accompaniment. \n\nFinally, we shared the \"Local Mushrooms\" plate. These buttery, rich, earthy shrooms were served with garlic, jus de veau (veal stock), and parsley. Damn. I mean seriously. I love mushrooms when they're raw and plain, so you can imagine how fantastic I thought these were... sauteed with such strong and beautiful ingredients. The garlic was sweet and powerful and the parsley added the perfect brightness. Who knew you could get so excited about and be so satisfied by a simple plate of mushrooms? I DID. And Isa delivered.\n\nAfter eating slowly and indulging in every little bite, we decided to pass on dessert. We didn't skip the wine though! I had an amazing champagne. Isa also features plenty of cocktails (all made with Soju) and beer. I was 100% happy with my bubbles (and $8.50 per glass wasn't too bad). Actually, the prices overall were pretty awesome, I think.

Essentially he saved us a few dollars.\n\nThe complimentary bread was so good.

The food was good to excellent, but the service left something to be desired. \n\nDRINKS  - Given that they don't have a full liquor license, I was really impressed by Isa's cocktail menu.

We later ordered the McIntyre Pinot Noir for the table, which was delicious.\n\nSERVICE -- The hostess in the front was a delight. Our waiter I'm only giving Isa 4 stars. He was an older Asian man who talked to us like we were idiots, wouldn't stop talking, and seemed fairly oblivious to what we actually wanted (i.e. a wine recommendation, but no food recommendations, and for him to stop talking). He was completely irritating, and we didn't need him to walk us through every single menu item.\n\nFOOD - We were *strongly* encouraged to order one item from the top half of the menu and one item from the bottom half of the menu per person. We actually ordered 5 and 5 dishes for the 6 of us, which was the perfect amount of food (maybe just a little too much). The waiter warned us, on repeat, that the chef was a proponent of \"something called family style\" and that he recommended we plan on sharing everything, which we did. \n\nSalmon Carpaccio - incredibly well done, delicate, and flavorful. Just perfect. \n\nArugula Salad - Great proportions of all the ingredients and very fresh with a light dressing. \n\nTruffle Risotto - probably my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly infused with a great combination of rice and mushrooms. \n\nRoasted Rack of Lamb - a little gamey, even though our waiter promised it wouldn't be, but otherwise delicious.

I placed the cheese on bread and dipped it in the mussels sauce - mmm!)\n* For my entree, I ordered the Seasonal Fish with artichokes, tomato confit, olives, basil & zucchini (I forgot what kind of fish it was, a mild white fish that was cooked just right, I couldn't finish it all because I got full from the mussels, bread and cheese - the fish was good though, solid)\n* My friend ordered the Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak with haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce (I tasted some, solid, cooked to her liking)\n* For dessert, I got the Semifreddo all' amaretto (mmm, refreshing, tasty) and my friend ordered the Vanilla bean gelato with biscotti (cool, creamy, loved the biscotti)\n\nAll in all, a solid dining experience, and I would recommend Isa.  Attentive service too; bread and water were generous and with our Dine About Town meals, a lovely glass of Malbec was included - I'm all for that!

The prawns were garlicy and juicy.  The two orders of this were gone in a flash.\n\nWe ended out meal with mascarpone and berries.  It was described to us as a deconstructed cheese cake.

Our server was full of personality and very helpful when describing items on the menu.  We had a few challenges getting the attention of the wait staff.

However, we were not seated until 9-910pm. We had plenty of time to look over the menu as we were waiting. Ordered right when we were seated. It was a four course meal. \n\nFirst course: We ordered three potato and leek soup and a arugula salad. Also, ordered a dozen oysters. The soup arrived first with bread and butter. The three soups were almost finished and we decided to ask our waiter for the status of the salad. Waiter's response was, \"we will bring it out when the kitchen is done with it.\" One of our second course dish came out and I asked our waiter about the salad that never came. To my surprise, he came inches away from my face and said, \"I TOLD YOU, WE WILL BRING IT OUT WHEN THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point, I'm in total shock. I have never ever in my life had a waiter get in my face like that. I sat there in disbelief and did not say a word. Luckily, my best friend who was sitting in front of me questioned the waiter about his rudeness. We had asked the manager of the restaurant for a new waiter. That kind of behavior and customer service is unacceptable. \n\nSecond course: I recommend the mussels and the goat cheese. Both were really good and had a lot of flavor. We also tried to salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. Not as good as it sounds. Also, as our waiter was serving our dishes, he knocked down a glass of wine on my best friend across from me. The entire restaurant went quiet as we all watch her wipe off all the wine that was on her face, neck, and shirt! The waiter was really apologetic and he seemed to be very sincere and genuine with his apology. It was truly an accident, and we didn't want to make him feel worst than he probably already feels about spilling the wine. We said it was totally okay and that he didn't have to keep apologizing. \n\nThird course: Seared scallops with bacon and mashed potatoes was a hit. Super good! I would also recommend the truffle risotto. We also ordered the seasonal fish with spinach. Fish was really bland, but the spinach was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the angus flat iron steak came. My friend took a bite from the steak and it was cold. Not warm but COLD. It was probably sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it was served to us. We mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter responded with, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? Is this a new thing where steak is served cold??

The pieces of steak that were moved when my friend tried to eat it was at the same placement when the waiter had brought it back to the kitchen. We figured they just microwaved it and brought it back. We barely ate the steak and asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. \n\nFourth course: While waiting for our dessert, our bill came. Waiter came back and wanted to know why we didn't want dessert. They must've misunderstood us, because we had asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. Due to the confusion, we probably had to wait another 15-20 minutes for some darn ice cream and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nThis has got to be the worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant.

Hostess gave us updates and options. Waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. Service was on point. \n\nFOOD: Isa has a prix fixe menu regularly. The DAT menu is actually 6 apps, 7 entrees, 4 desserts. The dishes are great for sharing. \n\nAppetizers (salmon carpaccio, dugeness crab salad, butter lettuce salad, arugula salad, Laura chenel goat cheese, PEI mussels) -- I recommend everything but the crab salad -- the weakest dish on the appetizer list. Might have been better if it came out before the stronger flavored dishes.\n\nSecond Course (scallops, seasonal fish, spaghetti, truffle risotto, range chicken, duck breast, flat iron steak)-- we have everything but the steak and doubled up on the duck breast. \nSeasonal fish is petrale sole. Everything was excellent. I don't normally order spaghetti or risotto, but like William Hung, I have no regrets at all. Each plate was very hearty -- the duck breast was one of the bigger plates. \n\nThird Course (Grapefruit granite, semifreddo all'amaretto, vanilla bean gelato, vanilla bean creme brulee) -- we had everything but the grapefruit. Semifreddo is very almondy, if you're into that, and goes well with expresso. \n\nPRICE: Prix fixe ~$35. Mix drinks $8-9. Tip included for larger parties. Damper -- they have a 3 course prix fixe for $29. I am sure the DAT is a better deal... I hope.\n\nTIPS: Make reservations early. Parking can get difficult. Isa has parking reservation service but we didn't try it. Happy hour before 7pm -- $5 drinks. Free wine glass per prix fixe Sun-Thurs. Choices for vegetarians were delicious! Kitchen is small -- our dishes came out a few at a time which was great for sharing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Definitely a good choice for DAT. Great choice if you have a vegetarian friend.

Especially if you decided to wear 3.5 inch heel booties 'cause \"it looks cute with your outfit.\" ESPECIALLY if you had to sprint 4 blocks in those same heels because you found parking 5 minutes before your reservation. A word to the wise, don't wear heels if you're driving to someplace with crappy parking...\n\nIsa. I've never been a huge fan of French cuisine, namely because of the notoriously small portions. But wow, Isa filled my heart and my tummy. \n\n\nMy BFF and I came here for the Dine About Town special. I had the salmon carpaccio, flat iron steak, and semifreddo amaretto, a glass of zinfandel, and a glass of really dry bubbly. I don't usually drink that much during a meal, but tonight we were being fancy, so why not go all out? My friend ordered mussels steamed in white wine, grilled fish (I think it was cod), and creme brulee.  \n\nimpressive: \n- salmon carpaccio: The salmon was very fresh! The capers, lemon, & cr\u00e8me fraiche were a nice touch. \n\n- angus flat iron steak: YUM. The steak was rather small, but it was cooked just the way I like my steak (medium-well). It was topped off with moutarde verte & an amazing bordelaise sauce. I believe moutarde verte is some sort of horseradish garnish because it tasted a little like wasabi. (I looked this up on Google, but only learned that \"moutarde\" is some sort of French profanity.)\n\n- steamed mussels: I hate shellfish, but today I decided to give mussels another chance. Although I still don't like the texture of mussels in general, the flavor of these was good enough to make me overlook that. The sauce was buttery with an alcoholic kick to it. (I love alcohol in food.)\n\n- semifreddo all' amaretto: Almond ice cream with 3 little almond biscuits. The ice cream was rich and creamy.\n\n\n\nmeh: \n- \"seasonal fish\": I don't remember what kind of fish this was, but it tasted like cod. The flavor was rather bland.\n\n\n\nsome observations:\n\n- My best friend and I had a dinner reservation for 6:15pm, but for some reason it was pushed back to 6:30pm. She was not notified of this change. A 15 minute delay isn't a big deal, but it would've been nice to receive a heads up or something---just as a courtesy. \n\n- The servers are very friendly, but are clearly amateurs. Our main server left after taking our drink orders, just as I was about to tell him we were ready to order everything else. There were times when a server would awkwardly mosey on by our table with an inquisitive look; but just as quickly, he'd disappear without a word.\n\nWe were served our food without proper descriptions. The server brought our mussels and happily announced our \"mushrooms are ready\". He also set down our tiny mussel-forks and said he'd bring us more \"spoons.\" I found this pretty endearing because of the server's confidence. English was obviously not his forte, so I can't give him crap for butchering the food names. However, a different server brought our other dishes without telling us what they were. Not cool. \n\nWhen we finished our main course, another server came and began rolling up the brown paper place mats before asking us to move our glasses. That would've been a liquidy disaster, had we not moved our 2 glasses of water, 2 glasses of bubbly, and my glass of red away in time. \n\n\nOverall, the food is pricey, but worth a try. Service is not exactly professional, but a smile & proper manners are often enough for me. \n\nOh yeah, expect to have a fun time looking for parking.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-06-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Seasonal fish: ours was the petra sole.

Knowing that most likely we'd need to go grab a drink elsewhere and just return at our scheduled time, we popped in to inquire just on the off chance that there was a table available for the three of us. The hostess let us know that there was a table finishing up but that it would most likely be about 15 minutes; she then personally escorted us over to an open spot at the bar and put us in the capable hands of the bartender. Who was fantastic! The hubs asked if they had Guinness and they did not, but the bartender suggested an alternative beer and described it so delectably that of course, we ordered one. Personable beyond belief. Our server, well, he was among the best parts of the evening. He explained the \"rules of the road\" and let us know that Isa recommends that each person at the table order one appetizer and one entree, and then everyone splits everything as the orders arrive. We were cautioned that things would arrive to the table as they came out of the kitchen (so, we didn't expect all three apps to land at the same time, or even before the entrees, etc.) and that was just fine with us! He also went into detail on the specials and took the time to make several specific recommendations. In the course of our initial conversation (and it was a conversation!) he let us know the correct pronunciation of the restaurant's name (EEE-sa) and let us know the story behind it (named for the chef's daughter Isabelle). Just a side note for any Yelpers thinking of trying Isa - 1. highly recommend it. 2. it's a California French style, not strictly French as categorized on Yelp. Not a huge thing, but it is definitely not purely French. Personally, the Californication of the food makes for a phenomenal product. Lastly about our knowledgeable, grin-inspiring server before I start in on the food: in the course of our conversation he came out with a from-the-gut laugh that was irreverent! It was one of those laughs that just makes you laugh as well. His laugh left all of us giggling along with him long after he'd left the table.\n\nFood:\n\nWe followed protocol and ordered three appetizers and three entrees, along with one side dish. First up: Tomales bay Pt Reyes oysters (6 oysters on the half shell with spicy orange mignonette). Fresh oysters are hard to mess up, but the orange mignonette really took them over the top into sublime territory. Next came the Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori and low sodium soy. Fresh, bright flavor! The clean flavor of the tuna was nicely offset by the mellow creaminess of the avocado. Yum! Our third appetizer was the Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon. Once again, a perfect symphony of complementary ingredients. The mellow of the crab was balanced with the creamy avocado and sweet apple, then perked up by the grapefruit and tarragon. C'est magnifique.\n\nOur entrees began to arrive next. Our first entree was the Seared scallops with saut\u00e9ed asparagus, garlic & truffle sauce. Four seared scallops were arranged on the plate with a mound of what may have been whipped potatoes topped with several spears of asparagus and drizzled with truffle sauce. The flavors came together beautifully and the truffle flavor was nicely subtle. We actually ordered a side dish of asparagus as well, not realizing that the scallops came with asparagus, but believe me, every stalk of asparagus on the table was eaten and enjoyed. The next entree to arrive was Seasonal Fish (halibut) with artichokes, tomato confit, olives, basil & zucchini. Delicious! Our final entree was the Potato wrapped Seabass with capers, fresno peppers, parsley, tomato confit, brown butter and lemon juice. The dish was excellent, but I am a sucker for anything brown butter so it put the entree over the top. \n\nAfter enjoying our apps and entrees so very much, we had to continue on to dessert. The hubs was being good and although we almost talked him into the grapefruit granite, he abstained and so we ordered two desserts instead of three. Both arrived at the same time, the first was a vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e which was sublime. The next was a vanilla bean gelato with biscotti and espresso, also fantastic. \n\nI cannot wait to come back here, it was just a phenomenal experience.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-15"}, {"excerpts": ["She gave us this cute table by the window where the seats sat next to each other as opposed to across from one another, We each got the prefix (arugula salad, flank steak & ameretto ice cream for her) (warm goat cheese, seasonal fish, and cheese/honey/nuts plate).

The foie gras was burnt to a black char and any good chef would have NEVER let that leave the kitchen! Normally, foie gras should cut like butter and I felt like I was sawing through firewood. Because the foie gras was overcooked and burnt, it lost all of its luxurious richness it once had. Aside from this, the peaches were too big to handle and should have been cooked down to a compote for easier eating.

We had the foie gras with strawberry and rhubarb compote and a custard brioche.  I did hear that the pear one was better, but I still enjoyed the strawberry one.  The seared foie was so delicious on the brioche and smothered in the sauce.  We did a wine pairing but our server recommended a different one then what was on the menu and it was a great pairing.  \n\nI went on a Sunday so we ordered one prix fixe menu and picked off the menu.  We  ordered the angus flat iron steak, Loch Duart salmon carpaccio, and potato wrapped seabass.  Unfortunately there was a mistake somewhere and we didn't get our seabass.  =(  The bf was very disappointed, but our server Jonathan was very nice and apologetic.  Since the kitchen was closed, he could only send us  dessert.  He sent out the chocolate cake and a slice of Point Reyes blue cheese.  The cake was okay.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese, but the cheese was very creamy and rich; I'm sure I would have loved it if I liked blue cheese. The grapefruit granite was so refreshing and perfect! \n\nI'll definitely be back since all the food is pretty good and I really want to try that seabass!

This year is no different after my first holiday dinner of the year...and I can thank Isa for that.\n\nAs a whole, there are a lot of things I like about this restaurant.  The vibe itself is pretty unique considering that it's almost like two separate places in one.  In the front, you get more of a lounge type of feel, with a wine bar and a number of tables bunched together for some casual dining.  However, once you get past the middle kitchen area, the back doors open up onto a covered patio area with heat lamps sprinkled throughout the area.  If you're familiar with Park Chow, it's kind of similar to their rooftop dining area, and I really like both.\n\nThe concept of the food at Isa is pretty different too; the meal is meant to be family style with each plate being prepared to be shared amongst the table, rather than as plates for each individual.  As such, the plates will still come out in the traditional order of courses, but on a \"ready to serve\" basis, rather than at a single time for the entire table at a time.  So accordingly, got a chance to try several different dishes in addition to my own.  Everything was really solid, but as for what I had ordered:\n\nHudson Valley Grade A Foie Gras - AWESOME.  The portion size for my order was probably the largest I've ever received.  I had to restrain myself from taking huge bites out of it...it was that good.  The poached pear was perfectly sweet and ripe, and I loved the wild huckleberry and custard brioche.  I couldn't find something wrong with the dish even if I wanted to.\n\nPotato Wrapped Seabass - I was a little worried about whether my foie gras and my second dish would be filling enough (it was a late dinner and I was starving), but the sea bass was a very filling second dish.  I remember seeing something similar to the description on an episode of Top Chef, and it pretty much sold me on trying this dish.  It definitely didn't disappoint - it was perfectly cooked, and was rather hefty in size.  Yum!\n\nCreme Brulee - creamy, not overly sweet, and just good!  I loved seeing a whole mess of vanilla bean grinds at the bottom...good to know they didn't skimp on it.  To (literally) top it, the creme brulee had a perfect topping - firm, but cracked easily with a strike of my spoon.  Nothing is worse than a soft crust (see Steps of Rome).\n\nService was great, and our waiters were so friendly.  Adjacent to our table, there was a small company holiday party going on, and our waiters were kind enough to sneak a couple glasses of their wine to two of my friends.  Talk about brownie points...haha.  The back patio area lends itself to making Isa a decent date spot, but it can get kind of loud for intimate conversations.  However, Isa is definitely a great spot for group outings though.\n\nLastly, for those on a budget, they do offer a three course prix fix menu for $29 that includes a number of the same dishes you'll find on the regular menu.  It's only offered on Monday-Thursday, but it's pretty worth it (we were here on a Thursday, and all of my other friends opted for that option except for me).  They offer up about a half dozen choices for each of the first and second courses, followed by a handful of choices for dessert.  Definitely not a bad deal and something I'll consider on my next trip back.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-01-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Main dishes: spaghetti with truffles, basil, parmesan cheese; potato wrapped seabass w/brown butter (MMMM); and Maple leaf farm duck breast.

They wouldn't allow for both.  I was a little stunned that they came and asked us.  To me, it was poor etiquette.  They even went as far as telling us that they would have to pay OpenTable if we got the 1000 pts so that was the reason why they wouldn't let us order off their prix-fixe menu.  Geez, talk about shady!  Since we didn't want to be restricted on the menu items, we opted for the 1000 pts instead.  Minus one star for this awkwardness.  \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful in giving us suggestions.  He reminded us that the dishes were meant to be shared.

We arrived an hour before our reservation time. Knowing that most likely we'd need to go grab a drink elsewhere and just return at our scheduled time, we popped in to inquire just on the off chance that there was a table available for the three of us. The hostess let us know that there was a table finishing up but that it would most likely be about 15 minutes; she then personally escorted us over to an open spot at the bar and put us in the capable hands of the bartender. Who was fantastic! The hubs asked if they had Guinness and they did not, but the bartender suggested an alternative beer and described it so delectably that of course, we ordered one. Personable beyond belief. Our server, well, he was among the best parts of the evening. He explained the \"rules of the road\" and let us know that Isa recommends that each person at the table order one appetizer and one entree, and then everyone splits everything as the orders arrive. We were cautioned that things would arrive to the table as they came out of the kitchen (so, we didn't expect all three apps to land at the same time, or even before the entrees, etc.) and that was just fine with us! He also went into detail on the specials and took the time to make several specific recommendations. In the course of our initial conversation (and it was a conversation!) he let us know the correct pronunciation of the restaurant's name (EEE-sa) and let us know the story behind it (named for the chef's daughter Isabelle). Just a side note for any Yelpers thinking of trying Isa - 1. highly recommend it. 2. it's a California French style, not strictly French as categorized on Yelp. Not a huge thing, but it is definitely not purely French. Personally, the Californication of the food makes for a phenomenal product. Lastly about our knowledgeable, grin-inspiring server before I start in on the food: in the course of our conversation he came out with a from-the-gut laugh that was irreverent! It was one of those laughs that just makes you laugh as well. His laugh left all of us giggling along with him long after he'd left the table.\n\nFood:\n\nWe followed protocol and ordered three appetizers and three entrees, along with one side dish. First up: Tomales bay Pt Reyes oysters (6 oysters on the half shell with spicy orange mignonette). Fresh oysters are hard to mess up, but the orange mignonette really took them over the top into sublime territory. Next came the Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori and low sodium soy. Fresh, bright flavor! The clean flavor of the tuna was nicely offset by the mellow creaminess of the avocado. Yum! Our third appetizer was the Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon. Once again, a perfect symphony of complementary ingredients. The mellow of the crab was balanced with the creamy avocado and sweet apple, then perked up by the grapefruit and tarragon. C'est magnifique.\n\nOur entrees began to arrive next. Our first entree was the Seared scallops with saut\u00e9ed asparagus, garlic & truffle sauce. Four seared scallops were arranged on the plate with a mound of what may have been whipped potatoes topped with several spears of asparagus and drizzled with truffle sauce. The flavors came together beautifully and the truffle flavor was nicely subtle. We actually ordered a side dish of asparagus as well, not realizing that the scallops came with asparagus, but believe me, every stalk of asparagus on the table was eaten and enjoyed. The next entree to arrive was Seasonal Fish (halibut) with artichokes, tomato confit, olives, basil & zucchini. Delicious! Our final entree was the Potato wrapped Seabass with capers, fresno peppers, parsley, tomato confit, brown butter and lemon juice. The dish was excellent, but I am a sucker for anything brown butter so it put the entree over the top. \n\nAfter enjoying our apps and entrees so very much, we had to continue on to dessert. The hubs was being good and although we almost talked him into the grapefruit granite, he abstained and so we ordered two desserts instead of three. Both arrived at the same time, the first was a vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e which was sublime.

This is a great place for large parties, as the food is reasonably priced and can be somewhat dressy or not. so everybody can feel comfortable coming here whether you are in jeans or cocktail dress. \n\nMy husband and I shared four appetizers and two entrees. \n- salmon capaccio: I thought the salmon would be really thin, but it's actually on the thick side. it was delicious though. \n- asparagus soup: this was disappointing, not too much flavor\n- foie gras: my husband thought it was just a little bit cold in the center. I thought it was just excellent. good portion and good flavor. it wasn't the best I've had, but this isn't one of those really expensive French place. I guess it could've been more tender. they are doing a \"good bye to foie gras\" deal, for $15. it's a great deal, makes me want to go back there before I have to say good bye to it. \n- some sort of salad: I forgot which one, but it was good. \n- lamb chop: the waiter asked me if we wanted 4 chops to share instead of the 3 chops that normally came with the dish. I said just 3 would be fine, since it's my husband's dish and I just wanted a bite. but when the dish came, with the large group and some people getting 4 chops, there was a extra 4 chops dish and we ended up with it. We didn't know we had to pay extra for the extra chop. oh, well, I just wish it didn't work out that way. Otherwise the lamb chop was good. \n- potato wrapped seabass: I was deciding between that and the fish of the day. I'm glad I picked the seabass. I like the crispy potato contrasting with the soft texture of the seabass and it was cooked just right.\n- creme brulee: very good, lots of vanilla beans and excellent sugary crust on top. \n\nOur friends also got the crab salad, which they said was really good. I also tried the mushroom risotto and pasta from other people's dish, the risotto was great and the past was just ok.  There was happy hr on the drinks on a saturday, which was awesome. I'm pregnant, so it's sad I can't have any. \n\nOh, yes, my husband and I ordered a lot of food and we ate it all. I was very full at 8 months pregnant. so I would order less food normally. I would say one appetizer, one entree and one dessert per person is enough. If you have a large group, you should definitely share appetizers as there are so many good ones to try. \n\nWe were told that we had to be kicked out by 9:00 pm, but we ended up staying until 10. We weren't asked to leave. We had a lot of credit cards, but the restaurant only let us use 2 cards.

Take my pants off and shout! I am a HUGE fan of paella, and Madonna strike me dead (and a pose) if this paella wasn't done right!

KFC, Popeye's, my mama's, etc. That's why it's called CRISPY. Because CRISPY is a thesaurus word for GOOD. I knows! The meat itself was a little too tough for the fact that it was $15.00 for like 1/4 of a tiny chicken. I swear, fancy schmancy restaurants never do a good job with chicken. Why? I don't know - maybe they just can't go the simple route.

In fact, let me instead let Beyonce and co. sum it up: \"You nasty, you trashy! You classless, girl! You sleazy, you freaky!\" I mean I don't know anything about no fancy place but is duck supposed to be raw the way it was? It was G.R.O.S.S., y'all. I tried to eat the cooked outer edge but the texture was like chewing on 3-day old gum you found under your BART seat - flavorless, tough, and utterly disgusting. I am sorry, Executive Chef Luke Sung, dreamlover of mine, but duck should not be raw!?!?!? Right??!?!? As a consolation, I think some girl in our group liked it, but really, it wasn't for me or basically everyone else in our party.\n\nThe worst part was that the raw duck was the last dish to come, so it was like going to a really awesome club where they played great music all night, and then end with a medley of Creed songs, starting with Arms With Open.

We waited at the bar for our table for around 15-20 minutes, and proceeded to order some wine.  We were seated in the patio area in the back, and it was lovely.  Our server was very friendly and we ended up ordering 4 dishes to share.  I love the medium to smaller dish concept because it lets us try more things!  We had such a hard time deciding which dishes to try, but ultimately decided on butterfish, flat iron steak, paella, and special of the night: beef short ribs. \n\nThe butterfish came first, and it was baked in paper with mushrooms and truffle oil I believe.  It was very tender and the flavors pretty much worked wonderfully.  It was definitely one of my favorites.\n\nThe flat iron steak was topped off with some bleu cheese, to which I dont really like but the steak itself was delicious.  bf devoured it in five minutes flat.\n\nBraised short ribs was the super star of the night.... tender, juicy, perfectly cooked and paired with broccoli and mashed potatoes.\n\nSaffron paella was just okay.... I like my paella a little different and without edamame, so i could do without this dish in the future. tasty, but not memorable.  I'd go with risotto next time maybe.\n\nWe must sound like pigs but we literally finished off every plate and licked it clean.  They were smaller portions so I guess three would have been sufficient but I'm glad we ordered what we ordered....the experience was terrific. \n\nGreat ambiance, great service.

Ultimately, it didn't matter too much since we ate family style, but appropriate space would've been nice.\n\nThe tiny quarters make for a cozy dining experience.

Food was solid all around and $40 was a pretty reasonable price. Made a reservation for a Sunday night for an early-ish dinner. We were seated right away and service was very friendly throughout the night.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the following items:\n1) Potato & Leak Soup w/ cream/truffle oil/chives: Friends 1st course from RW. Decent soup. Light and smooth though a bit heavy handed on the truffle oil which I didn't feel was very necessary in the first place. (3.25/5)\n\n2) Arugula Salad: My 1st Course for RW. A simple semi classic salad. Light vinegary dressing w/ some fresh fruits and some extra crunch from the fennel + a bit of nutty cheese. Can't go wrong. (3.5/5)\n\n3) Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio: My 2nd Course for RW: Another very classic dish. The main \"unique\" angle of this dish was the egg which honestly didn't stand out much. Salmon quality was decent (though personally wish it was a bit colder/firmer). Could've used some other flavor to make it standout but it's fine all around (3.5/5)\n\n4) Duck breast: My 3rd course for RW. One of the better dishes off the RW menu in my opinion. There isn't a flavor that blew my mind but it was good. Duck breast was very moist and tender (though would've liked a bit more sear on the fat) with just the right amount of fat. I wasn't a huge fan of the golden beets/spinach combination. The beets were soft and had a sweet earthy flavor but the chunks were too large. The spinach also didn't hold up to the other flavors and textures. The tangy goat cheese went well with the beets though. The huckleberry sauce went well with the duck. (3.75/5)\n\n5) Truffle Risotto: Friend's 3rd course. Had a bite. Not much to say. It's about as basic of a risotto as you can get from a semi-nice place. Pretty creamy and some mushroom flavor though. Not bad but there's better options (like the duck) (3.25/5)\n\n6) Foie Gras & Fruit Pairing: A $25 side option and the best item of the night. A very sizeable, solid piece of foie gras. Perfect sear, very fatty, and paired w/ some delicious pears and toasted almost custard-like bread. (4.75/5)\n\n7) Bucherondin De Chevre paired w/ a star-anise honey & walnuts: A lovely way to end the dinner. A semi-pungent goat cheese w/ a light amount of honey and some walnuts for crunch. Honey could have used a bit more of the anise flavor but then again it's all about that cheese (4.5/5)\n\nOverall, I left very happy with my meal. I do feel like my friend's options were a bit more underwhelming so I can't say how consistent this place is but they definitely have some good options that are worth the price.

However, we were not seated until 9-910pm. We had plenty of time to look over the menu as we were waiting. Ordered right when we were seated. It was a four course meal. \n\nFirst course: We ordered three potato and leek soup and a arugula salad. Also, ordered a dozen oysters. The soup arrived first with bread and butter. The three soups were almost finished and we decided to ask our waiter for the status of the salad. Waiter's response was, \"we will bring it out when the kitchen is done with it.\" One of our second course dish came out and I asked our waiter about the salad that never came. To my surprise, he came inches away from my face and said, \"I TOLD YOU, WE WILL BRING IT OUT WHEN THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point, I'm in total shock. I have never ever in my life had a waiter get in my face like that. I sat there in disbelief and did not say a word. Luckily, my best friend who was sitting in front of me questioned the waiter about his rudeness. We had asked the manager of the restaurant for a new waiter. That kind of behavior and customer service is unacceptable. \n\nSecond course: I recommend the mussels and the goat cheese. Both were really good and had a lot of flavor. We also tried to salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. Not as good as it sounds. Also, as our waiter was serving our dishes, he knocked down a glass of wine on my best friend across from me. The entire restaurant went quiet as we all watch her wipe off all the wine that was on her face, neck, and shirt! The waiter was really apologetic and he seemed to be very sincere and genuine with his apology. It was truly an accident, and we didn't want to make him feel worst than he probably already feels about spilling the wine. We said it was totally okay and that he didn't have to keep apologizing. \n\nThird course: Seared scallops with bacon and mashed potatoes was a hit. Super good! I would also recommend the truffle risotto. We also ordered the seasonal fish with spinach. Fish was really bland, but the spinach was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the angus flat iron steak came. My friend took a bite from the steak and it was cold. Not warm but COLD. It was probably sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it was served to us. We mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter responded with, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? Is this a new thing where steak is served cold?? The was absolutely the last straw for everyone at our table. Waiter took the plate back in to the kitchen and brought it back a few moments later. The pieces of steak that were moved when my friend tried to eat it was at the same placement when the waiter had brought it back to the kitchen. We figured they just microwaved it and brought it back. We barely ate the steak and asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. \n\nFourth course: While waiting for our dessert, our bill came. Waiter came back and wanted to know why we didn't want dessert. They must've misunderstood us, because we had asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. Due to the confusion, we probably had to wait another 15-20 minutes for some darn ice cream and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nThis has got to be the worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant.

(Doesn't matter, because SFRW has gone way downhill.) Not only did they offer four courses, but their dishes actually had variety and were worth trying, unlike many of the other contenders churning out a cookie cutter 3-course menu of soup or salad, boring entree, and brownie dessert. The portions were a good size, just a touch smaller than their usual portions. I'll include the current prices.\nWe were seated in the covered patio area behind the restaurant, which was probably a backyard in the past. Even though it was cold outside, the heating lamps and covered awning provided enough warmth and shelter. It felt cozy and inviting.\n\n$10 Maine Lobster Broth w/ prawns, tomato, celery & tarragon:\nHot & savory bowl that warmed me up from the first taste. There were just a couple pieces of lobster & prawn, but they were good-sized chunks. The broth was smooth and satisfying.\n\n$15 Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori & *low sodium soy:\nCubes of tuna served tartare style over creamy chunks of avocado, with seaweed salad. It was very good, but I wouldn't normally order this at a French restaurant.\n\n$16 Dungeness Crab Salad w/ avocado, apples, grapefruit & tarragon:\nThe shredded crab was not too shredded and the pieces were still substantial enough to be satisfying. The avocado, apple slices, and grapefruit each added variations in texture, and some tart and sweet flavors to the mix.\n\n$24 Seared Scallops w/ mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon & truffle sauce:\nScallops were seared just right with a browned surface, but still had a meaty and springy texture. Brussel sprouts were roasted to a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were so good with the savory sauce.\n\n$23 Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce:\nThe slices of flat iron were juicy and tender. The sauce on top was like a chimichurri, good flavor, but could have used more of it.\n\n$7 Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: \nCreme brulee isn't my favorite dessert. I still do enjoy taking a spoon and giving the torched caramelized crust a whack and seeing the broken window effect. Surprisingly it didn't break, as it was a rather thick crust. The custard underneath was nice and smooth.\n\n$7 Semifreddo all' Amaretto:\nI didn't know what to make of this semifreddo. I've had semifreddos before, but this seemed like half ice cream and half frozen bread. At least that was the texture that came to my mind. The almond cookies were good. I don't care for presentation or garnishes, but in this case, the sprig of mint was much needed to make this dish look good.\n\nNow that I think about it, I probably would enjoy the grapefruit granite. I wonder why I never tried it. \n\nThe chef has quite an impressive resume. I can see how he's going for a Californian Provencal menu, but most of the dishes seem more Californian to me.\nWould I eat here again? Since I've tried the above dishes, there's not much on the prix fix menu that intrigues me, except maybe the salmon carpaccio or the truffle risotto. I am interested in trying the foie gras though.

They're one of the very few restaurants offering a prix-fixe four-course menu for RW dinner for $40. \n\nINTERIOR\nThis place is super cozy for dinner, especially on rainy evenings. There were lots of people waiting in the front to be seated, but luckily I made a reservation. The hated patio seating is absolutely amazing and ask to be seated there if you can! There's plenty of heat lamps and wonderfully decorated string lights that really ups the ambiance more so than the other sections of the restaurant.\n\nSERVICE\nExcellent service! Our waiter was super friendly and smiley. Even though he was serving many tables that night, he was very patient with taking our orders and listening to our requests. The staff was very courteous overall. At the end of the meal, they gave us a sealed envelope with a surprise coupon inside, only to be opened by the staff when you visit next time. Very enticing! \n\nFOOD\nI really liked that the food was meant for sharing, and the servers would bring the plates to the middle of the table instead to each of us. We never had to wait too long between courses, but there were some discrepancies when one of us got a course way before another, so it just felt like a continuous stream of plates being served. \n\nFirst Course\nArugula salad: Pretty delicious, standard salad. The dressing on these salads are usually very flavorful, and they never dump an obscene amount of dressing on it. \nSmooth potato leek soup: This dish was really good, and I preferred this over the salad. The soup is very, very umami flavored which is great. Wonderful to dip bread in! \n\nSecond Course\nBaked Goat Cheese: This one took a while to come out because baking takes a while, but I recommend this for people who love goat cheese (and pizza!) It tasted more like a pizza without the crust, so I naturally used the bread that came with the meal as a dipping tool. \nYellowfin Tuna: My boyfriend ordered this and said it was comparable for the price point with an almost identical Yellowfin Tuna dish from Jean-Georges. Even though he's not a big fan of seafood, he thought it was prepared very well.\n\nThird Course \nTruffle Risotto: yummm mushroom overload! Although, compared to other same-tier restaurants I've been to for RW, the truffle flavor wasn't as flavorful as others. Still very delicious though.\nAngus flat iron steak: The waiter recommended medium-rare which is what my bf got, but he thinks it would have been overall if it was just cooked medium. This is more of a preference thing though.\n\nFourth Course\nGrapefruit Granite: This was a very tarty grapefruit shaved ice, and while it was good, it didn't wow me since shaved ice can only impress so much. Our waiter recommended that we eat this dessert first since the flavor is much stronger than the other. \nSemifreddo all'amaretto: This dessert was fantastic! The flavors are not overwhelmingly sweet like I expected it to be, and all the flavors worked so well together that it felt like a light ice cream cake.

There was holiday decor all around so it set a great mood for the dinner.\n\nMENU: The group (approximately 11 people) decided to order from the Pre-Fixed Sunday menu. I ordered the salmon carpaccio, truffle risotto, and the almond gelato. The entire meal was delicious! This was the best meal I've had in quite a while.

Well worth the wait as the meal and entire dining experience was top notch. Isa is nestled in the heart of the Marina district, juxtaposed between other cute eateries, wineries, and boutique shops. Parking can be difficult here, as I had anticipated from previous Marina adventures, so my friends and I took the 45 bus from 3rd&Market (which took about 45 minutes) to get here.  \n\nIsa's food is described as French-style cuisine which was apparent in some but not all the dishes.  I would describe their cuisine more as Asian-European fusion as many of their dishes had elements of different countries' cuisines on both continents. But overall all the dishes were delicious and well presented.  Isa's food is meant to be shared (e.g. Family style), and so my friends and I shared the dungeoness  crab salad, the baked goat cheese, grilled calamari, the yellowfin tuna, the scallops, the duck breast, the sea bass, and the wild mushroom truffle risotto.

The other dishes were good too, but not as amazing as the three I just mentioned.  Although of note, the scallops were tasty but I thought the accompanied orzo tasted kind of funny (maybe because I'm not much of a fan of orzo).\n\nMy friends and I came here early, at 5:30 for dinner because we wanted to watch the fireworks in the Marina afterwards.  On weekdays, Isa offers a pretty extensive happy hour drinks menu list, which features some specialty cocktails and wines for $5 (until 7pm). Needless to say my friends and I both had 3 drinks each.  Most of the cocktails are pretty tasty, but the Negroni is pretty strong. I was hoping it would be on the sweeter side, which it ultimately was, but I could taste more alcohol than sweet/sugar. I couldn't enjoy that drink as much as I wanted.\n\nThe service here is top notch, as wait staff always come around to fill bread, water and ask if how the food is and if you want to order more drinks/food.  Very professional and attentive staff.\n\nOverall my first experience at Isa was excellent as the food and service here were great!

Exactly how it sounds, a buttery sea bass enveloped by a potato crust. I've had this dish before at a fancy restaurant in Nantucket, and Isa blew it out of the water.

Our server greeted us and told us the specials, but both of us decided to go for the 3 course prix fix for $30/person.  Pretty good deal.\n\nFirst courses:\n\nOrganic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio - Pretty yummy for a starter.  You get four pieces of crostini and 6 thin slices of salmon with all the goodies on top.  The salmon was pretty fresh.  The toppings went well with the salmon and crostini.  If there was a hint of lime, I think it would of tasted much more refresh, but nonetheless, it was still pretty delicious.\n\nSteam Prince Edward Mussels - Yum!  The white wine sauce was so tasty that my friend even use the spoon and drank it.  The mussels tasted pretty fresh and it had the right amount of seasoning.  This dish comes with two pieces of grilled bread and it goes very well with the sauce.\n\nSecond Courses:\n\nTruffle Risotto - Yummy!  Cooked to perfection.  The flavors on this dish is just perfect and the texture was good.  The truffle didn't over power any taste on this dish.  We were able to take the wine, mushrooms, and truffle flavors at the same time.  Perfect amount of mushrooms with this dish too.  Yum.\n\nSpaghetti - This is a dish I didn't really care for.  The spaghetti is not as saucy as I liked it and it tasted like it was drenched in butter.  For spaghetti, I like more of a tomato-ey taste, but this dish just taste like it had too much butter.\n\nDessert:\n\nBuche Au Luit De Chevre - Light and fluffy is how I can explain this dessert.  It wasn't overly sweet with the taste of hazelnut.  Yummy!\n\nGrapefruit Granite - They said this is like a grapefruit sorbet, but to me its more like a grapefruit shave ice.  Nice way to end the meal. \n\nThe overall experience here was great.  The service was great as well.  Our empty dishes were cleared out pretty quickly and our waters were always filled.

They build an outdoor area with covers and it looks amazing. Loved the ambiance of the place.\n\n****TIP****\nHAPPY HOUR\nDollar oysters and half off alcohol menu!\n\nThe menu allowed us to have 4 entr\u00e9es. The first course, I picked the potato leek soup and my coworker got the arugula salad.  The soup was alright in my book but paired with the bread and butter they gave us that I dipped into the soup make it amazing! The free bread and butter reminded me of France. The butter was so yummy! (I know....all the rave about the bread and butter but....oh well)\n\nSince the waiter (who was super friend btw) told us they served everything family style and it comes out all together. The next thing that showed up was my coworker's salmon carpaccio (think that's what it was called) and that was super good! It had eggs and cucumber with it along with pieces of smoked salmon with a crustini. Yum! Before my yellow fin tuna came out, my risotto came out. Now, I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but it was a truffle risotto and of course I had to get it! Anything truffle, I'm ok with it...just other mushrooms makes me gag. Tried it and you get this heavy truffle taste along with parmesan . Yum! (Can I say, by this time I've engorged myself with so much bread and butter that I'm super stuffed!) But still, I couldn't help myself in scooping more risotto onto my plate. \n\nAfter that, the yellowfin tuna came out and it's of course, all raw. (Just realized that most everything we ordered were raw...hah) This was really delicious! The bottom had some avocado and drenched with some sriracha. Yum!  The combination gave me this heavy and spicy feeling and matched with the tuna, it was amazing! (Not sure if my description makes sense. hah)\n\nThen, onto the duck my coworker ordered. This was my least favorite...I'm not much of a duck person but it was pretty good. This...was also cooked a little raw (i never knew you could eat duck raw!) Maybe it was my mentality but eating it raw kinda make me go...ehh...no. For some reason, anything that's a bird and raw makes me scared because of chicken. But it was really flavorful and I was glad by this point, I was super full so I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.\n\nLast but not least, the dessert. We both got the vanilla bean creme brulee. Yum! It was smooth and really delicious! At first, I couldn't crack the burnt sugar on top but once I got into that custardy goodness, I was in creme brulee heaven. I was so sad when I finished it.\n\nService:\nMy oh my was the service spectacular. All the waiters were super friendly and attentive.

We were intrigued by their Dine about town menu and they were only serving from that menu the day we went. They mentioned they had the best DAT menu out there and I thought that to be a very bold claim but they have the skills to back the claim up. We were seated out in the back in a tent canopy type thing and it was really cute and heat lamps helped keep us warm. Our server was friendly and gave us no problems opening up the wine bottle we brought (corkage fee $20). \n\nTheir DAT menu features 4 courses. For most of the menu they serve the food family style, so essentially if you go with a date, you both get 8 courses and that's a fantastic deal. For starters we got the lobster broth with shrimp. The broth was fantastic and flavorful that went well when you soaked the amazing warm bread they bring you. The shrimp was overcooked a bit but the broth made you forget all about that. The next course was a salmon carppaccio that came with crostinis. Very fresh fish and the sauce on it made me enjoy the capers on it, I hate capers normally. They also offer $1 oysters so we got half a dozen to split. Very tasty with the house made vinegar but they run small. Next course was mussels with toasted olive oil bread and the clams were fresh and the broth was amazing to soak up the bread. So many broths which are all amazing on their own but you take it to a whole other level by soaking bread in them. So good. The next course was a truffle risotto with mushrooms. THE BEST RISOTTO I HAVE EVER HAD! No joke. I thought the best was made by Gordon Ramsey when I went to his LA restaurant, but no this flavor was way better. Granted Ramsey had better cooked risotto but the the flavor at Isa is unmatched so you didn't notice if some rice was undercooked/overcooked here or there. That's when you know you have something special, even if it isn't cooked perfectly, the flavor alone makes up for it. It was that good. I will go back to just order bowls of the stuff. The other entree was seared scallops with Brussels sprouts and bacon. Scallops were cooked perfectly, the sprouts were good even though I generally hate them but with bacon and mashed potatoes you can't really go wrong. One of the best scallops I've had in a while.\n\nFor dessert we ordered some amaretto frozen custard with cookies and it was really fricken good. So creamy and flavorful and it was still light. Very nice. The next dessert was goat cheese with honey and walnut and bread. Some people don't think cheese can be dessert, well I don't want to be your friend then. Heck yes, it's dessert and my girl can only eat so much cheese in one sitting so I pretty much had the whole thing to myself. I'm lactose intollerant but honey badger don't care. Cheese all up in my mouth and belly. It was so amazing! Overall this restaurant does have the best DAT menu in SF and they know it. The service was great, even when the bread wasn't gone they would immediately fill it up with new bread. They were on point and the food was to die for. Very romantic restaurant if you an sit outdoor in the patio area. My girl said \"the food game is strong with this restaurant.\" I have to agree strongly. If I could choose one restaurant to eat at once a week for the rest of my life. I might come here. Best DAT meal and experience I've ever had.

Although it looks small on the outside, there is ample seating inside, a full bar, and a beautiful outdoor patio sort of seating area. The seating area outside is full of lamp heaters, so unlike other places where you are only warm if you are right next to one of the heaters, the whole seating area was warm and cozy! The patio was lit with beautiful lights and just instantly made you feel at home and comfortable. \n\nService: Again, impeccable! Our server was kind and explained all the different menu items to us, especially because many of them had french words in the titles. Our food came out at perfect intervals, with one exception. My sister got her main course atleast 10 minutes before I got mine, which wasn't a big deal since we shared everything anyways. The only thing that came very late was my mojito that I ordered right when I got inside ($5 cocktails before 7pm, yes please!). The mojito came after the bread and the salad course, so it took quite a bit of time. Besides that, our waiter was charming and sweet! \n\nFood: \nSoup: Smooth Potato and Leek Soup with parsley, chives & cream --This was a nice soup to get started with. I've never had potato and leek soup, so it was different. I wish it was a little more flavorful (read: more salty or even spicy) but it was nice to dip the bread in. \nSalad: Arugula salad with fuji apples, persimmon, fennel, lemon vinaigrette & parmesan --This was delicious! I loved the flavors of the vinagrette with the fruits and arugula is my favorite, so I devoured this salad!\nMain Course: \n1. Truffle risotto with baby shiitake, hon shimiji mushroom & reggiano --I loved the baby shiitake mushrooms in this dish, added so much texture and flavor! The risotto was a little bland for my taste. Not sure if this is because the flavors from the salad were so powerful, but the risotto needed more seasoning and again, salt or spices. Something to give it direction perhaps? Not a bad dish, just not something I would order again. \n2.  Spaghetti with himalayan truffles, tomatoes, basil & parmesan cheese -- Very simple spaghetti dish. I guess you can't make spaghetti that amazing since it is a pretty simple dish, but the marinara sauce was definitely more flavorful than the risotto or soup dishes that I had previously, so I enjoyed that! \nDessert:  Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e -- MMM still dreaming about this dessert. The top was crisp and golden brown, and below was the creamiest, mousse type vanilla pudding. I was in love. Although I was so so full after the risotto, my creme brulee disappeared in minutes. \n\nVerdict: I would say the food was 3.5 stars, probably because although this was the most vegetarian friendly and appetizing looking menu for me, the dishes did not have as much promise. The risotto needed more flavor and the spaghetti was very simple. So I'd say it's party because it's a French restaurant, so their specialty isn't making delicious vegetarian dishes but rather more meat based ones. But regardless, the other courses were great and left us completely satisfied! Service + ambiance made it a solid 4 star experience. \n\nTips: \n+parking is hard in the marina--the garage we found was $2 an hour, change only but really turned out to be about $4 in hour (ugh). \n+get drinks before 7!

I ordered wine at the bar and it tasted sour. When I told him I thought my wine had turned, he denied it saying, \"I don't think so because I just opened that bottle.\" As if wine can't go bad unless it's opened? He then pours himself a glass in front of us, drinks it and says, \"Nope. Tastes fine to me.\" We were appalled. When I asked if I could get another glass, he said, \"Fine, but I'm going to make you taste it first so I don't waste another glass of wine.\" It was almost comical.\n\nI've never sent a drink back before, but I've seen it happen at much better restaurants with much more expensive wines and the response is always apologetic, no questions asked.

A new DAT favorite!\n\nI decided to take a backseat to the DAT planning this year and let my other friend take over. Boy, I'm sure glad she did! The main reason we chose this one was not only the menu, but the free glass of wine, which turned out to be an Argentinian Malbec. Not too dry, pretty smooth.\n\nOur waiter explained to the 4 of us that they served all their food family style. Perfect! We chose 4 items from each section, so we got to try a little bit of everything! Our servers were excellent at refilling our bread basket (although why did they only give us 4 pieces at a time??). That bread was mighty good. Crunchy crust, soft and warm middle.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Laura Chenel goat cheese. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese, but it was manageable and I liked how they played on the typical mozzarella with basil and olive oil. Unfortunately, they were out of the pei mussels, so we substituted for arugula salad that was supposed to come with persimmons (which it did not). Slightly disappointed with the apps overall, but the entrees made up for it. The other apps were the smoked salmon and dungeness crab salad. \n\nAll the entrees were delicious, with the truffle risotto being my favorite. I think my palette is changing... as I didn't feel like any one dish was particularly salty, but I felt like ingesting all of it together was a big salt intake. The flat iron steak cooked medium rare... delicious! The duck and the scallops were perfectly cooked, and all the sides (fingerling potatoes, green beans, brussel sprouts, etc) were also good.\n\nLastly, we got to try all 4 desserts. I'm not a huge grapefruit fan, but the grapefruit granita (or a glorified snow cone as I like to call it) tasted exactly as you would expect grapefruit to taste. Nothing else particularly extraordinary, but the vanilla bean gelato and the creme brulee were good, and the semifreddo amaretto (like a frozen mousse) slightly better. \n\nOverall, a very, very satisfying meal with fantastic service!

Hostess gave us updates and options. Waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. Service was on point. \n\nFOOD: Isa has a prix fixe menu regularly. The DAT menu is actually 6 apps, 7 entrees, 4 desserts. The dishes are great for sharing. \n\nAppetizers (salmon carpaccio, dugeness crab salad, butter lettuce salad, arugula salad, Laura chenel goat cheese, PEI mussels) -- I recommend everything but the crab salad -- the weakest dish on the appetizer list. Might have been better if it came out before the stronger flavored dishes.\n\nSecond Course (scallops, seasonal fish, spaghetti, truffle risotto, range chicken, duck breast, flat iron steak)-- we have everything but the steak and doubled up on the duck breast. \nSeasonal fish is petrale sole. Everything was excellent. I don't normally order spaghetti or risotto, but like William Hung, I have no regrets at all. Each plate was very hearty -- the duck breast was one of the bigger plates. \n\nThird Course (Grapefruit granite, semifreddo all'amaretto, vanilla bean gelato, vanilla bean creme brulee) -- we had everything but the grapefruit. Semifreddo is very almondy, if you're into that, and goes well with expresso. \n\nPRICE: Prix fixe ~$35. Mix drinks $8-9. Tip included for larger parties. Damper -- they have a 3 course prix fixe for $29. I am sure the DAT is a better deal... I hope.\n\nTIPS: Make reservations early. Parking can get difficult. Isa has parking reservation service but we didn't try it. Happy hour before 7pm -- $5 drinks. Free wine glass per prix fixe Sun-Thurs. Choices for vegetarians were delicious! Kitchen is small -- our dishes came out a few at a time which was great for sharing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Definitely a good choice for DAT. Great choice if you have a vegetarian friend.

Salmon was so deliciously fresh and the toppings complemented it very well.\nGoat Cheese:  Another good one but you definitely need to eat this with the bread, otherwise the cheese overloads you unless you like that sort of thing.  \nDungeness Crab Salad:  I also liked this dish.  It served with grapefruit as a topping and I'm not a fan of grapefruit, but I couldn't really taste it so the crab wasn't overpowered like other reviewers mentioned.  Maybe we got a grapefruit-less one?\nMussels: Mussels were average but the highlight was the consistent dunking and soaking of the bread in the amazing sauce they use.\n\nEntrees-\nSeared Scallops: TRUFFLE OIL!  That's what made this dish so amazing.  Gave the mashed potatoes and scallops a great, extremely addicting flavor.\nDuck Breast: Was really excited that this came with a salad since almost everything previous had been very heavy.  Duck was good..not too red and the potato thing that came with it was a surprising delight.\nTruffle Risotto:  Again...truffle oil.  Can't get enough of the stuff.

The dimly-lit but warm atmosphere of that patio was cozy and inviting, and our server was jovial and clearly passionate about the restaurant's concept and its food. \n\nAs the waiter is keen to emphasize, the concept at Isa is family-style dining.  It's a little misleading as the portions are neither large enough to feed a family nor budget-friendly.  The suggestion is to order double of every dish to ensure there's enough to go around.  Too often this means you're tricked into ordering more than necessary.  In this case, there WAS enough food to feed a small militia (or at least six very hungry people), but I didn't mind as everything was good to very good.\n\nSalmon Carpaccio: I had carpaccio only once before and thought it just wasn't my thing.  This carpaccio proved me wrong--it was cool and fresh, and the creme fraiche was smooth and provided great flavor. Atop the crunchy crostini, this was the perfect bite.\n\nGrilled Calamari: Overly salty and just a little plain, this was the weakest dish of the night.  But I liked the beans, and overall it really wasn't that bad.\n\nLaura Chenel Goat Cheese: A bit heavy and the flavor was too strong for my liking, but it tasted better with bread.  My coworkers are big goat cheese fans, and they liked this appetizer a lot.  \n\nNorthern Halibut a la Plancha: The fish was well-cooked but rather forgettable flavor-wise.  I liked the beets, which soaked up the tangy vinaigrette rather nicely.\n\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: After reading the Yelp reviews, I was adamant to forgo the prix fixe for this entree.  I love duck, and this one was fatty and delicious. The crunchiness of the (fried?) arugula provided nice textural contrast.\n\nGrilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak: My least favorite entree of the meal, probably because of the mustard greens in the sauce, which overpowered the meat.\n\nTruffle Risotto: Truffles, where have you been all my life?  How could I have gone this long without sampling your savory earthiness?  I practically inhaled this dish and greedily picked out all the remaining truffles when no one was looking.  Hands down favorite of the night.\n\nPan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range Chicken: The first piece of chicken I tried was juicy and tasty, but the rest of the bird (i.e. the breast) was a little dry. Not exactly mind-blowing.\n\nAfter the satisfying deliciousness of the appetizers and entrees, we were honestly too full to enjoy stuffing ourselves further.  It was for the best, as the desserts were a rather underwhelming denouement.  The Bucherondin De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey) was just okay but far better than the Roaring Forties, which tasted like how my brother's foot smells (seriously).  No one much cared for the grapefruit granite, which had a very pure, sour grapefruit flavor.  The semifreddo all' amaretto was soft and delicious and tasted just like biscotti, but I wouldn't go out of the way to order it.\n\nOverall, the savory dishes were tasty, with a few high notes.

Order this!\n- Grilled local calamari - not my cup of tea, but my friends were practically fighting over the last pieces.\n- Simply saute\u00e9d Sea of cortez wild prawns - simple but extraordinary. the lemon, garlicky butter is like having a bite of heaven. \n- Hudson valley grade A foie gras - still haven't mustered up the stomach for it, but it smells awesome, and everyone melted down their chairs when they bit into this.\n- Potato wrapped Seabass - AWESOME. that's it.\n- Truffle risotto - soooo creamy!!! i loved it!!! \n- Roasted rack of lamb - don't touch the stuff, but the friends that did eat it lOOOOOVed it. said it wasn't gamey (which makes me not like it) and it was roasted to perfection.\n- Maple leaf farm duck breast - still can't go wrong with this mother.\n- Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak - buttery meatiness.\n- Brussels Sprouts with garlic, bacon & extra virgin olive oil - mm.. not buttery enough, but they were cooked to tenderness. \n\n\n$57 per person for all that food and 3 bottles of wine, plus endless amount of cocktails, and 2 desserts, that ain't bad at ALL!

Here are my thoughts:\n\nSpicy Tuna tar tare:  fantastic!   Great size portion, although we laughed at the pine nut salad as it was more of a dollop than a salad.  The spice and lemon were just right.\n\nLobster bisque:  Jeff loved it.\n\nEndive, fennel, raddichio salad: solid salad.  I'm a sucker for caramelized walnuts and pears though.\n\nFlatiron steak:  cooked just right.  It was a great steak without being too \"interpretive\".  It was simply great steak.  Jeff loved it with a little sea salt to season.  The rosemary steak fries were a great compliment.\n\nTruffle risotto:  I usually get tired of risotto after a few bites, but this one had enough going on in flavor that I enjoyed the whole dish.\n\nBy the time we got to the dessert we were both stuffed.  The gelato was so rich we took 2 bites and called it a night.\n\nI left full, warm, and happy...can't ask for a better dinner!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-01-17"}, {"excerpts": ["truffle risotto with cheese.

"], "author": "Elaine H.", "review": "Came here a couple of nights ago to celebrate a birthday and we definitely had mixed feelings about this place. The food was amazing. The service was questionable. The atmosphere had its ups and downs.\n\nThank goodness we had made reservations. The line was practically out the door (some w/ reservations even). The restaurant itself wasn't too big, but it was jam-packed and with only one hostess running around. The atmosphere was dim, nicely decorated, but very cramped. We got stuck at a table by a plant and somewhat in the middle of an isle. I thought that our waiter had a very cute-middle-aged-decent-kind-hearted-might-get-mugged-by-bad-guys look to him. So although my friends booed his service, my biased self gave him extra points compared to them. The table we got stuck at was extremely UNSPACIOUS and caused quite a bit of uncomfort. But I know how it is when people ask for a table change. People will be pissed, whether its the waiters or other staff. On top of that, they did have a s**tload of people waiting. So it was understandable that he couldn't give us that table. He did tell us in a nice tone. But I could understand why my friends were pissed. He told us that it was a GOOD table compared to many others already. Mistake. But on top of the extremely crowded spot we were stuck in, the bussers kept walking back and forth in between the tables next to us and they kept knocking down our bags, kicking our chairs etc. without any apologies. Our waters were refilled time and time again though. But, they did totally forget about our last entree, collected our dishes and handed us the dessert menu (the busser, and then the waiter). We had to remind them twice that we still had one more dish coming. Therefore, I had to knock down a star, despite the wonderful food. Oh yeah, and our server gave us the bill with the 18% gratuity added on there for \"our convenience\" he said. It would've looked a lot better if the gratuity part wasn't written in BY HAND. I let that slide once again because of the way he looked, but my friends were EFFIN furious! And since when was there gratuity for a party of 4?\n\nNow for the food. It was recommended that we order one appetizer and entree per person, therefore leaving room for dessert. Family style was recommended as well. I'm glad we only ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 2 desserts, because we were just the perfect amount of full afterwards. The dishes aren't cheap, and the portions weren't big, but nothing on the menu was bad. Consider it a tasting menu.\n\nCrab Salad - it was my favorite item of the whole night (and my friend's too). Large chunks of crab meat, and not with too many overwhelming spices. \nSpicy Tuna - this one was good too, but somehow I've just had better tuna dishes before.\nCeviche - I'm not positive of what fish was in this one, but it this dish was quite good. Better than the Spicy Tuna one.\n\nSeared Scallops - my friend really liked this one, but I felt that the scallops were a tiny bit over-cooked. I like my seafood raw or close to raw. But the corn and mashed potatoes that came with it probably TIED IT UP with the CRAB SALAD if not BETTER! It was just soooooo good! It was freakin' delicious. I wish they had a side of that to order.\nButterfish - they said they could taste the \"Chinese\" in this one. I thought the butterfish was perfectly tender and cooked just right (better than the scallops, but not the corn and mashed potatoes).\nFlat-Iron Steak - the steak was cooked to perfection and it was very juicy. Good steak indeed, but we could agree that its something we can have at many elsewheres.\nMushroom & Truffle Risotto - if there was a disappointment for the night, this one would've been it. There's no meat in this one, just mushrooms, expensive shaved tiny pieces of expensive mushrooms, and cheese. Lots and lots of provolone cheese. Cheese may be good to eat, but bad to smell. And we all felt that this dish was just too CHEESY. But it wasn't bad to eat, as I've mentioned previously.\n\nCreme Brulee - amazing and not too sweet, but the hard sugar coat on top was a bit TOO HARD. I'd prefer the creme brulee over at PPQ anyday.\nFlourless Chocolate Cake - the vanilla bean ice cream was good. The chocolate cake itself wasn't too sweet, which was good. But nothing too special.\n\nOverall, the food was great. Knocked down a star for the service and crowdedness of the restaurant.

Not usually a fan of eggplants but when chopped into pieces with zucchini, red peppers, and olives, it was delicious! Had an order of Potato Wrapped Seabass, which was my favorite entree dish! Flavorful and delicious when paired with potatoes! The last order we had was the Grilled Golden Gage Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak. The steak was well-done and a bit dry, but the zucchini was good and the flavor was very tasty. Four entrees with three different appetizers, we were definitely full, but not too full, meaning we had room for desserts!\n\nWe ordered two Vanilla Bean Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, one Flourless Chocolate Cake with vanilla bean gelato, and one order of the Semifreddo All Amaretto. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good because it wasn't too sweet, but tasteful enough to enjoy. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was my favorite because it was paired with vanilla bean gelato which tasted super good! Not a fan of the amaretto taste, but I really enjoyed the little cookie pieces inside the ice cream.\n\nOverall, good meal. Will be back because I didn't get to try the Dungeness Crab Salad and Organic Loch Duart Calmon Carpaccio. The service was excellent. The wine had a nice aroma to it even though I'm not a red wine fan. Ordered a bottle to pair with the meal, which was nice. Had a lot of wine options and even offered some soju cocktails.

He was completely irritating, and we didn't need him to walk us through every single menu item.\n\nFOOD - We were *strongly* encouraged to order one item from the top half of the menu and one item from the bottom half of the menu per person.

Just perfect. \n\nArugula Salad - Great proportions of all the ingredients and very fresh with a light dressing. \n\nTruffle Risotto - probably my favorite dish of the night.

No explosive flavors.\n\n2nd Course:\nDungeness Crab Salad: The crab was almost non existent. It was more lettuce than anything. \nYellowfin Tuna: Had just the right amount of spice. This item was one of the more memorable ones.\n\n3rd Course:\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: Another memorable item that I will never stop thinking about. The meat was so tasty and tender and the beets were to die for.\nBraised Short Ribs: Fall off the bone, tender meat served with mashed potatoes and veggies. So full of flavor and a definite MUST.\n\n4th Course:\nSemifreddo all' Amaretto: A yummy, creamy, not too sweet custard served with three small vanilla cookies. \nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee: The name says it all. Pair this with the amaretto. \n\nDrinks: A glass of Riesling for me and a Stella for the hubby.\n\nService all around was on point. The silverware and plates were always cleared from the table and new sets were placed. The bread was neverending and delicious. During our dinner, there was a delay in the kitchen and the maitre d' informed each table and apologized for the wait. \n\nIn the end, we were full and satisfied.

The second course was my favorite...salmon carpaccio and the yellow fin tuna over avocado with seaweed salad and nori!! They were both sooo good!!

IMO, it was oversalted, had too much cream and butter, and the texture was past the recommended soft chewiness.\n\nThe Duck Breast was tasty, and a little on the rare side. I had never eaten Duck Breast being slightly rare, but it was really yummy. The accompanied tossed salad provided the tartness to offset the smokey flavors in the duck. A total winner, I'd get this for myself next time.\n\nThe Halibut was well seasoned and cooked well, with not too much butter. I enjoyed the basil zucchini flavors with olives, total umami.\n\nThe rest were well done, and throughout the entire meal, we marveled over the freshness in ingredients with great technique. Often times, you go to a place that doesn't get both right. Isa does it right, and at the end of the night, we were very happy with our meal. Service was attentive without being stuffy, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is really warm and lovely. We didn't opt to sit outside on the patio, but I'm sure it is just as lovely.\n\nAnother side note of great service, Husband and I got there early and had to wait for our friend to arrive. The hostess was super sweet, and told us that we had nothing to worry about in losing our reservation. In fact, she let us pick our table, and she kept it open as many people starting flocking into the restaurant! It was a really sweet gesture, and we appreciated it much.

It was delicious.  Try it with the bread.  I ran into another friend there too who stated the leek soup was not as good.\n\n2nd course\nI had the mussels.  The mussels itself were ok. The sauce though I really enjoyed.  Especially with the bread it came with.  My friend and I were lapping it up.  She ordered the crab salad that was refreshing.  I was expecting more flavors but I guess it couldn't be as rich as the sauce I had with the mussels.\n\n3rd course (where we diverged)\nMy friend received her Grilled golden gate natural angus Flat iron steak with zucchini, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce first.  It was...disappointing.  The steak was way too salty.  That stood out too much for its own good.  And weirdly enough, the bordelaise sauce made the rest of the steak almost taste like duck.  It was a very uncomfortable course.  It was a very small cut of steak to begin with and she could only stomach eating less than half of it. Yikes! \n\nI had the Maple leaf farm Duck breast with baby spinach, pinenuts, currants, bacon & sherry vin sauce which was a much better course.  The duck was also a bit salty but not as much as the steak.  The spinach and currents were a good compliment.  It also came with a type of potato hash/pancake thing that did not work with the dish.\n\n4rd course\nMy Semifreddo all'amaretto was delicious but i LOVE amaretto.  My friend's Vanilla bean creme brulee was...underwhelming.  It was just a bit bland.\n\nOn to service, I had to ask for more water and remind them of our bread request twice.  I also requested a cup of coffee to have with my dessert.  They never brought it.  After our desserts were done I told the same waiter to cancel my coffee request then he stated \"Oh yea! I'm sorry I forgot about that.\" So yea...\n\nEither case, for $37.95 for a four course meal, it was a good deal.  I don't know if I would eat here otherwise.

Yum! Now, we were already starting to get a bit full, but we had two courses left. Third course included the truffle risotto and maple leaf farm duck breast. The truffle risotto was thick and rich, and the duck breast was soft and flavored with huckleberry sauce. These two dishes were more savory and filling, and we had to pack both home as we were stuffed! However, no matter how full we are, there's always room for dessert. My friend and I joked how we have two stomachs: one for dinner and one for dessert. Our dessert stomachs were empty and ready for deliciousness. We ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee and Buche Au Lait De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey and walnuts.) The creme brulee was delicious (when is it not?) but nothing different from any other restaurant. The entree with goat cheese was unique though in my opinion: a slice of bread lathered with rich goat cheese and sprinkled with honeyed walnuts. I'm not usually a huge fan of cheese, but I have to admit this was awesome. \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful experience at Isa. Service was impeccable; our wait was friendly and visited our table often to refill water and our basket of bread, answer questions, and ask about our experience.

We were seated by very friendly staff in the back patio, which is covered and warm because it has a bunch of heat lamps. The atmosphere is so nice and very classy. It reminded me of LA restaurants with the outdoor garden-type setting, rustic wood tables, and strings of lights.\n\nDuring DAT they offer only the DAT menu, but that is not a problem because there is such a wide selection. I would suggest getting a variety of dishes and sharing, which is what we ended up doing.\n\nApps: \nBaked Laura Chenel goat cheese with pesto, tomato, concassee & pinenuts- this was soooo good. It's creamy and tangy, though not too much. Yes, it's a simple dish, but the combination of flavors just works really well together. It tastes good on the bread, which is warm and pretty much bottomless (they kept bringing more and more bread to the table.. which can be pretty dangerous!)\nDungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon- this was good too, although I don't think the flavors worked as well. The crab was fresh but not particularly memorable. A little more citrus would have worked better. It's a nice big portion.\n\nMains:\nSeared scallops with butternut squash, sweet potatoes, spinach, bacon & truffle sauce- this was a really good combo. I love the side veggies- bacon makes everything taste good. I couldn't taste much truffle though. I do think the scallops were a tad overcooked- I prefer scallops with a chewy center, and i would say these were cooked through.\n\nMaple leaf farm duck breast with red cabbage, potato gallete & wild huckleberry sauce- the duck itself was amazingly tender and well-cooked, with a crispy skin. The berry sauce was quite good. The red cabbage was kind of WTF? it tasted mushy and sweet. I could do without it. The potato gallete was basically hash browns.\n\nDesserts:\nSemifreddo all'amaretto: This was kind of odd. It was icy on the edges, which is no bueno :( The amaretto cookies were forgettable.\nVanilla bean gelato with biscotti- The gelato was yum! You get two big scoops, so if you want lots of gelato this is a great option. The biscotti was good but soooo hard. I like the crumbly kind a lot better.\nFlourless chocolate cake, vanilla bean gelato- The winner! It is the most popular dessert according to the waiter, and for good reason. It is warm and more of a souffle in my opinion. The middle is melty like lava cake. You get a tiny ball of gelato, which I mixed with my cake :)\n\nOverall, amazing service and a TERRIFIC choice for DAT!

"], "author": "Tiffany W.", "review": "Despite my initial concern about the empty-appearing restaurant and bickering front-of-the-house staff, all misgivings melted away when the host led us to the back patio.  The dimly-lit but warm atmosphere of that patio was cozy and inviting, and our server was jovial and clearly passionate about the restaurant's concept and its food. \n\nAs the waiter is keen to emphasize, the concept at Isa is family-style dining.  It's a little misleading as the portions are neither large enough to feed a family nor budget-friendly.  The suggestion is to order double of every dish to ensure there's enough to go around.  Too often this means you're tricked into ordering more than necessary.  In this case, there WAS enough food to feed a small militia (or at least six very hungry people), but I didn't mind as everything was good to very good.\n\nSalmon Carpaccio: I had carpaccio only once before and thought it just wasn't my thing.  This carpaccio proved me wrong--it was cool and fresh, and the creme fraiche was smooth and provided great flavor. Atop the crunchy crostini, this was the perfect bite.\n\nGrilled Calamari: Overly salty and just a little plain, this was the weakest dish of the night.  But I liked the beans, and overall it really wasn't that bad.\n\nLaura Chenel Goat Cheese: A bit heavy and the flavor was too strong for my liking, but it tasted better with bread.  My coworkers are big goat cheese fans, and they liked this appetizer a lot.  \n\nNorthern Halibut a la Plancha: The fish was well-cooked but rather forgettable flavor-wise.  I liked the beets, which soaked up the tangy vinaigrette rather nicely.\n\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: After reading the Yelp reviews, I was adamant to forgo the prix fixe for this entree.  I love duck, and this one was fatty and delicious. The crunchiness of the (fried?) arugula provided nice textural contrast.\n\nGrilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak: My least favorite entree of the meal, probably because of the mustard greens in the sauce, which overpowered the meat.\n\nTruffle Risotto: Truffles, where have you been all my life?  How could I have gone this long without sampling your savory earthiness?  I practically inhaled this dish and greedily picked out all the remaining truffles when no one was looking.  Hands down favorite of the night.\n\nPan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range Chicken: The first piece of chicken I tried was juicy and tasty, but the rest of the bird (i.e. the breast) was a little dry. Not exactly mind-blowing.\n\nAfter the satisfying deliciousness of the appetizers and entrees, we were honestly too full to enjoy stuffing ourselves further.  It was for the best, as the desserts were a rather underwhelming denouement.  The Bucherondin De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey) was just okay but far better than the Roaring Forties, which tasted like how my brother's foot smells (seriously).  No one much cared for the grapefruit granite, which had a very pure, sour grapefruit flavor.  The semifreddo all' amaretto was soft and delicious and tasted just like biscotti, but I wouldn't go out of the way to order it.\n\nOverall, the savory dishes were tasty, with a few high notes. Isa restaurant offers quality food, attentive service, and an enjoyable dining experience.

It was very good, but I wouldn't normally order this at a French restaurant.\n\n$16 Dungeness Crab Salad w/ avocado, apples, grapefruit & tarragon:\nThe shredded crab was not too shredded and the pieces were still substantial enough to be satisfying. The avocado, apple slices, and grapefruit each added variations in texture, and some tart and sweet flavors to the mix.\n\n$24 Seared Scallops w/ mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon & truffle sauce:\nScallops were seared just right with a browned surface, but still had a meaty and springy texture.

It was delicious.  Try it with the bread.  I ran into another friend there too who stated the leek soup was not as good.\n\n2nd course\nI had the mussels.  The mussels itself were ok. The sauce though I really enjoyed.  Especially with the bread it came with.  My friend and I were lapping it up.  She ordered the crab salad that was refreshing.

Yikes! \n\nI had the Maple leaf farm Duck breast with baby spinach, pinenuts, currants, bacon & sherry vin sauce which was a much better course.  The duck was also a bit salty but not as much as the steak.  The spinach and currents were a good compliment.  It also came with a type of potato hash/pancake thing that did not work with the dish.\n\n4rd course\nMy Semifreddo all'amaretto was delicious but i LOVE amaretto.  My friend's Vanilla bean creme brulee was...underwhelming.  It was just a bit bland.\n\nOn to service, I had to ask for more water and remind them of our bread request twice.  I also requested a cup of coffee to have with my dessert.  They never brought it.  After our desserts were done I told the same waiter to cancel my coffee request then he stated \"Oh yea! I'm sorry I forgot about that.\" So yea...\n\nEither case, for $37.95 for a four course meal, it was a good deal.  I don't know if I would eat here otherwise.

(Please refer to the picture I've uploaded). This God awful thing came out looking like a piece of turd, not just any piece of turd BUT A BURNT PIECE OF TURD!! As a chef, how do you allow something like that to leave your kitchen?? I've never seen foie gras like this! It was NOT seared but more burnt, if it were seared the searing marks from the grill would be visible (it was non-exisitent in this case). BTW, I ate a HUGE piece of burnt foie gras and it was painful! Usually when you cut into foie gras, it should be a smooth transition from the time your knife cuts through the top to the bottom. BUT not with this foie gras, I felt like I was struggling to cut this into pieces. There was also this stringy rubber like consistency that I've NEVER seen in foie gras, it looked like the phlegm you spit out into a sink!! *BARF* \n\nHOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO \"BLAND\"\nGRILLED GOLDEN GATE NATURAL ANGUS FLAT IRON STEAK w/ haircots verts, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce- The flat iron steak was cooked medium rare, exactly what I asked for BUT the steak was extremely bland. I found myself trying to grab as much of the moutarde verte as I could to flavor this thing. Why didn't I use the bordelaise sauce? Oh, because it was overpoweringly salty and made the dish even more unappetizing. The fingerling potatoes were undercooked, it was tough cutting into it and when I bit into it, it was pretty darn raw. The haircots verts was the best thing on the dish because it had a snap to it when you bit into it and it was seasoned nicely. \n\nTHERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT\nVANILLA CREME BRULEE- This was the best thing out of the entire meal, even then that's not saying much because the crust of the creme brulee was very very VERY thick (that's what she said). Usually when you have creme brulee, it's fairly easy to crack the surface by one top of your spoon. Well in this case it took both my friend and I 2-3 taps until the surface broke, we looked at each other confused and wondering is creme brulee suppose to be like this? If you're not careful eating this, you might just end up stabbing your mouth. Though the surface was tough, the inside was nice and creamy. \n\nSERVICE\nI felt like they were a bit unorganized, we got our entrees while we were still working on our appetizers and we had to maneuver plates around just to make room. Also, utensils were taken away after my appetizer. When my entree was placed in front of me, I was looking for utensils and there were none so I had to ask for  fork and knife. -_-\" Though I felt like the service was unorganized, they were very attentive and our waters were always refilled. \n\nCONCLUSION\nThe pros could NOT outweigh the cons.

The dimly-lit but warm atmosphere of that patio was cozy and inviting, and our server was jovial and clearly passionate about the restaurant's concept and its food. \n\nAs the waiter is keen to emphasize, the concept at Isa is family-style dining.  It's a little misleading as the portions are neither large enough to feed a family nor budget-friendly.  The suggestion is to order double of every dish to ensure there's enough to go around.  Too often this means you're tricked into ordering more than necessary.  In this case, there WAS enough food to feed a small militia (or at least six very hungry people), but I didn't mind as everything was good to very good.\n\nSalmon Carpaccio: I had carpaccio only once before and thought it just wasn't my thing.  This carpaccio proved me wrong--it was cool and fresh, and the creme fraiche was smooth and provided great flavor. Atop the crunchy crostini, this was the perfect bite.\n\nGrilled Calamari: Overly salty and just a little plain, this was the weakest dish of the night.  But I liked the beans, and overall it really wasn't that bad.\n\nLaura Chenel Goat Cheese: A bit heavy and the flavor was too strong for my liking, but it tasted better with bread.  My coworkers are big goat cheese fans, and they liked this appetizer a lot.  \n\nNorthern Halibut a la Plancha: The fish was well-cooked but rather forgettable flavor-wise.  I liked the beets, which soaked up the tangy vinaigrette rather nicely.\n\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: After reading the Yelp reviews, I was adamant to forgo the prix fixe for this entree.  I love duck, and this one was fatty and delicious. The crunchiness of the (fried?) arugula provided nice textural contrast.\n\nGrilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak: My least favorite entree of the meal, probably because of the mustard greens in the sauce, which overpowered the meat.\n\nTruffle Risotto: Truffles, where have you been all my life?  How could I have gone this long without sampling your savory earthiness?  I practically inhaled this dish and greedily picked out all the remaining truffles when no one was looking.  Hands down favorite of the night.\n\nPan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range Chicken: The first piece of chicken I tried was juicy and tasty, but the rest of the bird (i.e. the breast) was a little dry. Not exactly mind-blowing.\n\nAfter the satisfying deliciousness of the appetizers and entrees, we were honestly too full to enjoy stuffing ourselves further.  It was for the best, as the desserts were a rather underwhelming denouement.  The Bucherondin De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey) was just okay but far better than the Roaring Forties, which tasted like how my brother's foot smells (seriously).  No one much cared for the grapefruit granite, which had a very pure, sour grapefruit flavor.  The semifreddo all' amaretto was soft and delicious and tasted just like biscotti, but I wouldn't go out of the way to order it.\n\nOverall, the savory dishes were tasty, with a few high notes.

Local California food with a French influence, served tapas style? Yes, yes, yes. I'm all in.\n\nEvery single thing we ordered looked and tasted so wonderfully complex, but the best part is that these dishes are actually so simple. No hidden ingredients. This is the kind of restaurant that doesn't have a gluten-free menu because they don't need one; all of the food descriptions are clear and our waiter was amazing with answering questions (even though I didn't really have any). He reassured me that our meals were GF. \n\nAdam and I decided to order three small plates to share. Their menu changes frequently because they only use seasonal and fresh foods, of course, but in early March we were lucky enough to have the \"Baked Laura Chenel goat cheese\" which comes with basil pesto, tomato concass\u00e9e, and pinenuts. It's served with fresh sourdough bread (Adam loved it), and I ate this incredible cheese straight with a fork. OH MY GODS. It was so perfect. I love goat cheese and Isa's presentation was gorgeous.\n\nWe also ordered the \"Grilled local calamari\" which is made with honey spice, lemon zest, and arugula; served on a bed of flageolet beans. Whoa. At first I thought I'd be freaked out because I haven't eaten a lot of calamari that wasn't deep-fried (so it's been like, 5+ years since I've had any). I wasn't freaked out though, I was in love and obsessed... simply fawning over this amazing plate. The calamari had an incredible delicate yet meaty texture, they weren't chewy at all. They were sweet and a bit tart, and the hearty beans were the perfect accompaniment. \n\nFinally, we shared the \"Local Mushrooms\" plate. These buttery, rich, earthy shrooms were served with garlic, jus de veau (veal stock), and parsley. Damn. I mean seriously. I love mushrooms when they're raw and plain, so you can imagine how fantastic I thought these were... sauteed with such strong and beautiful ingredients.

Isa also features plenty of cocktails (all made with Soju) and beer. I was 100% happy with my bubbles (and $8.50 per glass wasn't too bad). Actually, the prices overall were pretty awesome, I think.

Due to the layout of that part of the restaurant, we had to sit side-by-side. It was a good thing I liked my date! (Though I suppose even if I didn't, sitting side-by-side would mean I wouldn't have to look at him very much...)\n\nI was very impressed with Isa. The atmosphere was perfect for a date.

My oh my, that was delicious. It had the exact same rich lobster-y flavour as a bisque, without the heaviness. Next was the FOIE GRAS with apples, huckleberry, and custard brioche (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=kW2AjUC3cp3j1FtdqvJY8Q). (My date had never tried it before so I HAD to order it for us. I could never date someone who was against the force-feeding of ducks to fatten up their livers for me to eat). The foie gras was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. The huckleberries provided a nice acidity to cut the fattyness of the foie. I also loved the fact that they put the brioche on the side instead of under the foie so that it wasn't soaked with fat.\n\nFor the entrees, I had the duck breast with beets, chevre, arugula and huckleberry sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=B8ovbnJn86OLbfdr36jqqA). The DUCK BREAST was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The chevre also went really well with the arugula. My date ordered the RACK OF LAMB with saut\u00e9ed eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, and lamb jus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=jSSJrDKf5J92eKlG2irFkQ). That was delicious too. The meat was cooked well. The saut\u00e9ed vegetables were so good that I ate most of them off his plate (I also need to date someone who'll share their food with me). We got a side of potato puree too (fancy term for mashed potatoes). They were also tasty and very creamy, but nothing spectacular.\n\nFor dessert we just split a CREME BRULEE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=2J8Tee15TzN8UbSulA7vkA). Again, very good but pretty standard stuff.\n\nIt was a good date. But whether it was because of the food or the company, I'm not really sure.

However, we were not seated until 9-910pm. We had plenty of time to look over the menu as we were waiting. Ordered right when we were seated. It was a four course meal. \n\nFirst course: We ordered three potato and leek soup and a arugula salad. Also, ordered a dozen oysters. The soup arrived first with bread and butter. The three soups were almost finished and we decided to ask our waiter for the status of the salad. Waiter's response was, \"we will bring it out when the kitchen is done with it.\" One of our second course dish came out and I asked our waiter about the salad that never came. To my surprise, he came inches away from my face and said, \"I TOLD YOU, WE WILL BRING IT OUT WHEN THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point, I'm in total shock. I have never ever in my life had a waiter get in my face like that. I sat there in disbelief and did not say a word. Luckily, my best friend who was sitting in front of me questioned the waiter about his rudeness. We had asked the manager of the restaurant for a new waiter. That kind of behavior and customer service is unacceptable. \n\nSecond course: I recommend the mussels and the goat cheese. Both were really good and had a lot of flavor. We also tried to salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. Not as good as it sounds. Also, as our waiter was serving our dishes, he knocked down a glass of wine on my best friend across from me. The entire restaurant went quiet as we all watch her wipe off all the wine that was on her face, neck, and shirt! The waiter was really apologetic and he seemed to be very sincere and genuine with his apology. It was truly an accident, and we didn't want to make him feel worst than he probably already feels about spilling the wine. We said it was totally okay and that he didn't have to keep apologizing. \n\nThird course: Seared scallops with bacon and mashed potatoes was a hit. Super good! I would also recommend the truffle risotto. We also ordered the seasonal fish with spinach. Fish was really bland, but the spinach was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the angus flat iron steak came. My friend took a bite from the steak and it was cold. Not warm but COLD. It was probably sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it was served to us. We mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter responded with, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? Is this a new thing where steak is served cold?? The was absolutely the last straw for everyone at our table. Waiter took the plate back in to the kitchen and brought it back a few moments later. The pieces of steak that were moved when my friend tried to eat it was at the same placement when the waiter had brought it back to the kitchen. We figured they just microwaved it and brought it back. We barely ate the steak and asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. \n\nFourth course: While waiting for our dessert, our bill came. Waiter came back and wanted to know why we didn't want dessert. They must've misunderstood us, because we had asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. Due to the confusion, we probably had to wait another 15-20 minutes for some darn ice cream and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nThis has got to be the worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant. If I could give this place a zero star I would. So, this one star is for the waiter Dean.

It had a very down home feel to it and it was nice to dip our bread into. I can't say that I would order this on a normal day but it was definitely tasty.\n\nArugula salad: I'm usually not a fan of arugula. I guess I like more hardy salads. However, the salad had a great taste to it and the dressing was very nice.\n\nButter lettuce salad: Definitely my favorite! The salad was bustling with flavor from the apples, bleu cheese and walnuts. The dressing was quite nice as well. I would definitely order this again.\n\nSecond course: \nAhi tuna: This was another one of my favorites. The tuna was super soft and almost buttery, it tasted very nice and fresh. The plate was presented very nicely. In every scoop I was able to get some tuna, seaweed salad and avocado. Definitely must order this dish!\n\nSalmon carpaccio: This was also very tasty. It didn't stand out as much as the tuna but nonetheless was a great dish.\n\nMussels: The mussels were very tasty. I did wish that the broth was a lot warmer (temperature wise) But other than that it had great flavor and was a great size to share.\n\nFinal course:\n\nChicken and mashed potatoes: This was my choice and I was not let down. The chicken was nice and moist and had a great, light sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were my favorite! They were creamy and the perfect consistency. I'm talking like grandma's thanksgiving mashed potatoes caliber!\n\nLamb: I'm not a huge fan of lamb and the dish had olives which i'm also not very keen of. Also, the lamb tasted a little tough. \n\nDuck: The duck was very yummy. It wasn't too fatty tasting and it laid on top of a very tasty sauce. I would definitely order it again.\n\nDessert:\n\nI'm not big on desserts. However, I loved the grapefruit shaved ice thing! (I think it had a fancier name than that) it was nice and tangy and very refreshing for my palate after our hearty meal. My friends were pretty obsessed with the ice cream as well.\n\nAll in all, great restaurant! The service is good. I did notice that sometimes the servers were a little too eager to take your plate.

The leek contributed to a nice soup flavor that you just can't quite find anywhere else.\n\nSteamed Mussels - Cooked in white wine and garlic, their mussels were not only delicious, but also very fresh and full.  I have never eaten mussels that were still very full, within its own shell!  Loved this dish.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Wild Prawns - I liked the garlic and lemon sauce.  The prawns were cooked on point.

For $36.95 we got 4 courses: soup, salad, main course, and dessert. \n\nAmbiance: Impeccable! A perfect environment to go have a nice, intimate meal with your girlfriend or special someone. Although it looks small on the outside, there is ample seating inside, a full bar, and a beautiful outdoor patio sort of seating area. The seating area outside is full of lamp heaters, so unlike other places where you are only warm if you are right next to one of the heaters, the whole seating area was warm and cozy! The patio was lit with beautiful lights and just instantly made you feel at home and comfortable. \n\nService: Again, impeccable! Our server was kind and explained all the different menu items to us, especially because many of them had french words in the titles. Our food came out at perfect intervals, with one exception. My sister got her main course atleast 10 minutes before I got mine, which wasn't a big deal since we shared everything anyways. The only thing that came very late was my mojito that I ordered right when I got inside ($5 cocktails before 7pm, yes please!). The mojito came after the bread and the salad course, so it took quite a bit of time. Besides that, our waiter was charming and sweet! \n\nFood: \nSoup: Smooth Potato and Leek Soup with parsley, chives & cream --This was a nice soup to get started with. I've never had potato and leek soup, so it was different. I wish it was a little more flavorful (read: more salty or even spicy) but it was nice to dip the bread in. \nSalad: Arugula salad with fuji apples, persimmon, fennel, lemon vinaigrette & parmesan --This was delicious! I loved the flavors of the vinagrette with the fruits and arugula is my favorite, so I devoured this salad!\nMain Course: \n1. Truffle risotto with baby shiitake, hon shimiji mushroom & reggiano --I loved the baby shiitake mushrooms in this dish, added so much texture and flavor! The risotto was a little bland for my taste. Not sure if this is because the flavors from the salad were so powerful, but the risotto needed more seasoning and again, salt or spices. Something to give it direction perhaps? Not a bad dish, just not something I would order again. \n2.  Spaghetti with himalayan truffles, tomatoes, basil & parmesan cheese -- Very simple spaghetti dish. I guess you can't make spaghetti that amazing since it is a pretty simple dish, but the marinara sauce was definitely more flavorful than the risotto or soup dishes that I had previously, so I enjoyed that! \nDessert:  Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e -- MMM still dreaming about this dessert. The top was crisp and golden brown, and below was the creamiest, mousse type vanilla pudding. I was in love. Although I was so so full after the risotto, my creme brulee disappeared in minutes. \n\nVerdict: I would say the food was 3.5 stars, probably because although this was the most vegetarian friendly and appetizing looking menu for me, the dishes did not have as much promise. The risotto needed more flavor and the spaghetti was very simple. So I'd say it's party because it's a French restaurant, so their specialty isn't making delicious vegetarian dishes but rather more meat based ones.

Both looked like soapy water and plastic bowls, and looked unappetizing. The lobster broth tasted like REALLY watered down imitation lobster.\n\nFor our second course, we got dungeness crab salad and yellowfin tuna. The dungeness crab salad included large leaves of greens that made it extremely hard to eat, slices of grapefruit in the salad were overpowering, and the crab was tasteless. The yellowfin tuna was average - nothing special, but a touch of soy sauce would have been nice.\n\nOur third course was seared scallops and braised short ribs. These entrees came in big plates for sharing. The seared scallops was underwhelming. The scallops sat on top of brussels sprouts, bacon, and mashed potatoes. It felt like something you could make at home like a prepackaged meal from a supermarket. The braised short ribs weren't bad though. The meat was tender and pretty flavorful.\n\nLastly, for desserts, we had the semifreddo all' amaretto and a vanilla bean creme brulee. The semifreddo all' amaretto tasted weird like chemicals and was pretty unappetizing. The creme brulee was just average.\n\nWe sat in the back patio of the restaurant where the tables were fairly close to one another. You could easily eavesdrop on other conversations if you wanted to.

He forgot to bring one person's glass of wine for about twenty minutes. He forgot to take our food order for equally as long, and actually started to take away the menus before we let him know that we had not, in fact, told him what we wanted to eat. Possibly the most awkward interaction I had with the waiter was when I went to order the arugula salad. I was to share the salad (they encourage sharing on the menu) with my friend who's allergic to dairy, and she had called ahead to make sure they would allow substitutions based on dietary restrictions (they said yes), so I asked for no goat cheese. The waiter said that would be entirely impossible due to the restaurant week menu, so my friend had to explain that she had called ahead about this, etc. At this point he said that only she would be allowed to order without goat cheese, so she ordered the salad and I ordered the appetizer she was going to get... talk about overly complicated and frankly annoying.\n\nAnywho, the food itself was incroyable. I had the potato and leek soup, which was really nice though a bit thicker than I expected, and I also sampled the lobster broth soup.

I tasted the steak, too, which was really tender, though by that point I was stuffed. I had the grapefruit granite for dessert, but I should have gone with the ice cream dish.\n\nThis is the kind of place I'll take my parents when they visit SF, but it was fun to do the restaurant week menu with a group of friends.

It can best be described as a Patio that had a roof dropped on it. The ladies and I decided to take advantage of Isa's prix fix. You can't beat 3 courses for 29 bucks, especially since ISA's normal menu prices will make your tummy happy but wallet very sad.\n\nAll the items on the Prix fix sounded delicious .
