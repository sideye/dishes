There was nothing in the fridge, and I was too lazy to go to the store.  Luckily my neighborhood offers plenty of take-out options; I picked this place, which was just down the street.  I had never eaten there, but I was comforted by the fact that it's usually pretty busy inside.  The Yelp reviews said it specialized in something called \"meatless chicken.\"  It was the most popular thing on the menu. \n\nThe first time I ordered it, the meatless chicken came in brown cubes.  The texture was so meat-like and it tasted so chicken-y that I thought they had made a mistake with my order.  Perhaps I was a little naive, but I had eaten plenty of similarly advertised meatless items before.  So befuddled was I over the mystery meat's identity that I couldn't finish it.    \n\nA few days later, I was still so uncertain over my meatless chicken experience that I decided I needed to order it again.  This time I ordered the meatless chicken as lunch special with a sesame sauce.  (Btw- lunch special is a great deal - it's cheap and it's huge.)  The meatless chicken was totally different this time - deep fried and smothered in the sesame sauce to the degree that my taste buds could detect no fake chicken-y taste at all..  Reassured of the product's meatlessness and encouraged by the fact that it was deep fried in fatty goodness, I enjoyed the artificial meat much more the second time around.  You can read more about the slippery and subjective boundaries between meatless distaste and delight here, and also see some pics.  http://homogastronomicus.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-matter-of-haut-gout.html\n\nI also really liked the onion pancake that comes with a peanut dipping sauce and the chive dumplings.

I don't take back anything of my previous review (other than the rating), as I acknowledge (both then and now) that my earlier review was premature.  That said, I stand by my qualified hesitation regarding the General's Meatless Chicken.  I've never gotten it again, and I don't think I ever will.  I know now, however, that one can order the General Meatless Chicken without it being deep fried.\n\nMy favorite dish, bar none, is the Kung Pao Meatless Chicken.  It is, in fact, the very best vegetarian kung pao I've had anywhere.  Despite my concern about the veggie chicken based on its deep fried preparation, this veggie chicken is amazing.  It's delicious.  It's wonderful.  I love its taste and texture.  I've tried it in the kung pao, the basil meatless chicken, and the Mongolian meatless chicken (different kind of meatless chicken, I think).  I've also enjoyed the Mongolian meatless beef -- the meatless chicken was better, and the price of the Mongolian meatless beef the most expensive item not on the menu (I think they jack up the price to screw unsuspecting patrons).  I've tried the fried rice -- both veggie and meatless chicken (veggie better).  Moreover, I've tried some dim sum -- all vegetarian -- the egg rolls, the potstickers, and some of the dumplings.\n\nTo be sure, I have some reservations about Big Lantern.  First, I've found that the food is uniformly better during the week than it is on the weekend.  There is a different chef, and the kung pao in particular is not nearly as flavorful Friday-Sunday, as it is on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  That said, when BL is on, it's really quite satisfying.  The portions are reasonable; the flavors are vibrant.  It's classic Chinese food prepared in a vegetarian way, which is so very difficult to find.  The soup (vegetarian wonton) and the dim sum, universally, is just okay.  It's well prepared and not greasy, but it also lacks flavor.  \n\nOverall, with experimentation, one gets a good sense of what's good to order at BL.  And, with that, it stands in a class by itself.  While I love Golden Lotus/Golden Era, it's Vietnamese, and these Chinese classics are not offered.  Oakland now has a place called Nature Vegetarian, which is a vegetarian Chinese restaurant, but it just hasn't delivered.  While Big Lantern is not a dedicated vegetarian restaurant, it delivers more often than not, with delicious vegetarian chicken (or meatless chicken, as they call it) that brings one back to her Chinese roots.\n\nThe only other game in town for a good Chinese vegetarian menu (other than Enjoy Vegetarian) is Wild Pepper further down in the Mission.  Wild Pepper is good, too, but leans towards the salty side.  Between the two, I prefer Big Lantern, although I think that Wild Pepper is probably more artfully prepared.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-12"}, {"excerpts": ["You'll see all the usual suspects in the veggie section of their menu including kung pao, general tso, mu-shu and beyond (like the crispy fried tofu with spicy pepper).

If you like garlic, the cucumber with garlic chili sauce appetizer is not to be missed. It's a little spicy, salty, slightly sweet and oily (like most garlic chili sauces), and tastes amazing with steamed rice. When you're done eating all the cucumbers, save the sauce and take it home. The garlic chili sauce is delicious on everything. I've even used it to marinate tofu the next day and mixed it with noodles to make szechuan style noodles at home, yum!

After cutting my teeth on Boston and New York Chinatown food, something about the local Chinese seemed, well lacking. Maybe it was the fact that every chinese place here seems to sell the same Hunan cuisine that there's not much to distinguish it. Even the venerable Henry's Hunan has lost its luster.\r\n\r\nSo, when friends from Tampa said we should have Chinese tonight, I hit the reviews online and decided on Big Lantern.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant - clean and bright with an open kitchen. We were shown a table by someone that we assume is the owner. The menu was unexpected - focusing on special dishes with only a small selection of the typical Chinese standards. After talking to the owner about their best dishes, we went with a selection of dim sum, meat dishes and a noodle dish.\r\n\r\nThe dim sum ranged from excellent to good. The stuffed crab claws and hargow were excellent. The siu mai, siu long bao and the shrimp toast were very good, and the pan fried pork buns were good. Nothing bad, and the crab claws are the best any of us have had in ages.\r\n\r\nI asked if they had pork belly for twice-cooked pork, but unfortunately they didn't have any - but he offered a similar dish with roasted char siu, which fit the bill. As of their next printing of the menu, real twice-cooked pork with pork belly will be on the menu. We also had Kung Pao Chicken, very well made, but I am not a fan of zucchini in this dish. The surprising dish was an excellent spicy \"numbing\" noodles - lo mein covered with a ground pork and shiitake ragout.\r\n\r\nAll of this, Pu Erh tea and two beers ran us $60.

He loves smelt, tripe, tongue, preserved egg, fermented tofu, jelly fish, snouts, brain, etc. etc. etc. You name it and he loves it. \n\nSo when we were too hung over this weekend to leave the house and needed food we settled on Chinese. Plus we thought, let's order extra so we have lunch leftovers! \n\nFirst we each ordered soups (the only truly edible dishes we ordered). I got egg flower, he got west lake beef soup. They were the exact same soup but one had beef added to it and one had mushrooms added to it. I had the first bite and when the BF asked how it was I said, \"Very warm, bland, but ok.\" He took his bite and agreed. \n\nNext up we opened the fried rice. It was dark brown. It was completely drenched in soy sauce. I actually contemplated rinsing it out. I've read Susanna Foo's book, I know how non-Chinese cooks (*points to self*) ruin Chinese dishes. By adding too much soy sauce and oil. This dish is the perfect example for Susanna Foo's \"how to not make fried rice\" example. If you like drinking soy sauce then you'll love this dish. But while I do love to put soy sauce on almost every Chinese dish I order, I couldn't eat much of this. \n\nThen came the order of Chive Dumplings. This was the first dish that was spit out. I think my BF took it as a challenge to be able to prove to me he can eat anything. He barely swallowed it. I don't know how a chive dumpling can go so wrong. The chives tasted like overcooked collard greens that were rotten. The rice wrapping was even bad! It had the worst texture I've ever tasted or seen. \n\nNext we decided maybe we'll try our Beef and Broccoli. And it was decent. It was edible and not overcooked. But it was soooo over sauced. I was able to eat about 4 whole bites. \n\nAnd here comes the best part.... \n\nOk, maybe the Mu Shu Chicken will be better. BF unwraps the foil to get the mu shu wrappers and guess what he finds....

I get a weird look on my face and so the BF grabs a bite and instantly spits it out and runs to the sink to rinse his mouth out. A tortilla couldn't have made it taste any better. \n\nThe only thing we both actually finished was the soup.

I don't take back anything of my previous review (other than the rating), as I acknowledge (both then and now) that my earlier review was premature.  That said, I stand by my qualified hesitation regarding the General's Meatless Chicken.  I've never gotten it again, and I don't think I ever will.  I know now, however, that one can order the General Meatless Chicken without it being deep fried.\n\nMy favorite dish, bar none, is the Kung Pao Meatless Chicken.  It is, in fact, the very best vegetarian kung pao I've had anywhere.  Despite my concern about the veggie chicken based on its deep fried preparation, this veggie chicken is amazing.  It's delicious.  It's wonderful.  I love its taste and texture.  I've tried it in the kung pao, the basil meatless chicken, and the Mongolian meatless chicken (different kind of meatless chicken, I think).  I've also enjoyed the Mongolian meatless beef -- the meatless chicken was better, and the price of the Mongolian meatless beef the most expensive item not on the menu (I think they jack up the price to screw unsuspecting patrons).  I've tried the fried rice -- both veggie and meatless chicken (veggie better).  Moreover, I've tried some dim sum -- all vegetarian -- the egg rolls, the potstickers, and some of the dumplings.\n\nTo be sure, I have some reservations about Big Lantern.  First, I've found that the food is uniformly better during the week than it is on the weekend.  There is a different chef, and the kung pao in particular is not nearly as flavorful Friday-Sunday, as it is on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  That said, when BL is on, it's really quite satisfying.  The portions are reasonable; the flavors are vibrant.  It's classic Chinese food prepared in a vegetarian way, which is so very difficult to find.  The soup (vegetarian wonton) and the dim sum, universally, is just okay.  It's well prepared and not greasy, but it also lacks flavor.  \n\nOverall, with experimentation, one gets a good sense of what's good to order at BL.  And, with that, it stands in a class by itself.  While I love Golden Lotus/Golden Era, it's Vietnamese, and these Chinese classics are not offered.  Oakland now has a place called Nature Vegetarian, which is a vegetarian Chinese restaurant, but it just hasn't delivered.  While Big Lantern is not a dedicated vegetarian restaurant, it delivers more often than not, with delicious vegetarian chicken (or meatless chicken, as they call it) that brings one back to her Chinese roots.\n\nThe only other game in town for a good Chinese vegetarian menu (other than Enjoy Vegetarian) is Wild Pepper further down in the Mission.  Wild Pepper is good, too, but leans towards the salty side.  Between the two, I prefer Big Lantern, although I think that Wild Pepper is probably more artfully prepared.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-12"}, {"excerpts": ["You'll see all the usual suspects in the veggie section of their menu including kung pao, general tso, mu-shu and beyond (like the crispy fried tofu with spicy pepper).

If you like garlic, the cucumber with garlic chili sauce appetizer is not to be missed. It's a little spicy, salty, slightly sweet and oily (like most garlic chili sauces), and tastes amazing with steamed rice. When you're done eating all the cucumbers, save the sauce and take it home. The garlic chili sauce is delicious on everything. I've even used it to marinate tofu the next day and mixed it with noodles to make szechuan style noodles at home, yum!

He called me and SANG, ~~~Big Lantern. I'm downstairs~~~ LOL. It's freezing-balls out there. Who could sing anymore?\n\nFood was still warm. At just the right temperature to eat without burning yourself, except the soup which was still very hot. The General Chicken (one of their most popular item) was \"very good\" according to my boyfriend. The deep-fried battered chicken pieces seemed a bit soggy, but that's just the difference between eating at the restaurant and doing take-out. I ordered a second entree because the guy told me free fried rice if you order two entrees. I ordered the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings, not one of his recommendation but it was something my boyfriend and I adore back in our hometown. Mmm. Not so great here. Neither salty nor peppery. Topped with a ton of fried garlic and some sliced jalape\u00f1o with a hint of curry/cumin and lemon AND they're on steroids. Next time I'll stick with the guy's recommendations. The fried rice was a big fried rice (I think 26oz) and you get to pick what type of meat you want in it. Even though it was unusually dark, it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Boyfriend said he preferred steamed rice. My chicken corn soup (without chicken) was disappointing. There was barely any corn.\n\nTheir service was definitely worth 5 stars. Their food is sub-par. But I will order delivery from them again. \n\nHighlights:\n+ friendly service\n+ speedy delivery\n+ doesn't limit their delivery service to only places within walking distance; they did say they'd deliver to anywhere in SF\n+ extensive vegetarian options\n\n+/- free fried rice with your choice of meat if you order 2 entrees (not that yummy)\n\n- sub-par Americanized Chinese food\n- barely any corn in my corn soup (me sad)", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-06-02"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the General Meatless Chicken and let me say, IT WAS SO GOOD.

It has a lot of crispy, fresh veggies  though in all honest it's a little greasy.\n3.) Truth be told, everything here is kind of a bit too greasy.\n4.) Tortillas are always yummy. Well, actually, not quite always. They are not so tasty when topped with the gelatinous gravy from this place. This is the way I envision my Mexican American grandmother cooking Chinese food, except much lighter and healthier.\n5.) Sometimes (but not always) their fried rice tastes a lot like how I used to make fried rice when I was five. I just added soy sauce every time the rice started to stick to the bottom of the wok. The result is very, very salty rice.\n6.) The spring rolls are a gelatinous greasy mess. *gag*\n7.) Delivery, while on time, is still so slow you might actually end up getting so hungry that you eat before they get there.\n8.) This one of very, very few places I've ever been to where we've been asked to leave our table the instant we paid the bill.

I've contemplated laying the rice out on a paper towel when I bring it home (I often order and bring it back to the east bay as NO chinese hits the spot like Big Lantern) to suck up some of the grease, but the grease level will never stop me from ordering this amazing dish.\n\nGeneral/Five Spice Sesame Meatless Chicken: What? Oh my god. Perfection. Tastes just like chicken for those of you who don't eat a lot of tofu (and those who do). Fantastic flavor and crispy broccoli with it.\n\nAll of the Dim Sum is fantastic, especially the pork and/or chicken Siu Mai. I also recommend the bacon shrimp rolls.\n\nThe salt and pepper chicken wings are to die for and will leave you wanting a nap IMMEDIATELY after. The flavor is right (all the way down to the squirs of lemon and the diced garlic that garnishes the dish) and the batter is golden-fried to perfection. These are chicken wings that you will want to get every time. \n\nIf you work in the city and you need food delivered, this place is your best bet if you've got something to busy you for about 45 minutes to an hour for the delivery wait.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-03-25"}, {"excerpts": ["meatless sesame chicken is to die for.

If you respect your body and your stomach in particular, you will not eat here. \n\nMy friend wanted some meatless chicken, so we decided to check this place out since they have an entire section on their menu dedicated to imitation meat. \n\nWe went with the Braised Tofu with Bok Choy, General Meatless Chicken, and Sesame Meatless Chicken. \n\nOkay let's begin with the tofu. If any of you eat tofu regularly, you know you need to season it for it to be consumable. Unfortunately, Big Lantern did not follow these general tofu preparation guidelines. What we received were soft blocks of plain tofu swimming in thin gravy surrounded by large chunks of bok choy. I tried, fam, I really tried to enjoy the tofu but it was inedible. The bok choy was chopped into huge pieces that were extremely difficult to consume in one or multiple bites. I ended up slathering this dish in sriracha. \n\nLet's move on to the chicken. The General Meatless Chicken was funky y'all! It tasted bitter and sour-- as if the meat itself was bad. I did enjoy the cashews and veg that accompanied the chicken though. As for the Sesame Meatless Chicken, that was probably the tastiest dish out of the ones we ordered. It had your typical Sesame sauce, and the chicken was prepared in the most appealing way out of the two chicken dishes we ordered. It was fried, however, I would have appreciated if the fried shell was a tad bit crispier as it turned out to be on the soggier side.  \n\nI do want to note that the service was pleasant!

I don't take back anything of my previous review (other than the rating), as I acknowledge (both then and now) that my earlier review was premature.  That said, I stand by my qualified hesitation regarding the General's Meatless Chicken.  I've never gotten it again, and I don't think I ever will.  I know now, however, that one can order the General Meatless Chicken without it being deep fried.\n\nMy favorite dish, bar none, is the Kung Pao Meatless Chicken.  It is, in fact, the very best vegetarian kung pao I've had anywhere.  Despite my concern about the veggie chicken based on its deep fried preparation, this veggie chicken is amazing.  It's delicious.  It's wonderful.  I love its taste and texture.  I've tried it in the kung pao, the basil meatless chicken, and the Mongolian meatless chicken (different kind of meatless chicken, I think).  I've also enjoyed the Mongolian meatless beef -- the meatless chicken was better, and the price of the Mongolian meatless beef the most expensive item not on the menu (I think they jack up the price to screw unsuspecting patrons).  I've tried the fried rice -- both veggie and meatless chicken (veggie better).  Moreover, I've tried some dim sum -- all vegetarian -- the egg rolls, the potstickers, and some of the dumplings.\n\nTo be sure, I have some reservations about Big Lantern.  First, I've found that the food is uniformly better during the week than it is on the weekend.  There is a different chef, and the kung pao in particular is not nearly as flavorful Friday-Sunday, as it is on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  That said, when BL is on, it's really quite satisfying.  The portions are reasonable; the flavors are vibrant.  It's classic Chinese food prepared in a vegetarian way, which is so very difficult to find.  The soup (vegetarian wonton) and the dim sum, universally, is just okay.  It's well prepared and not greasy, but it also lacks flavor.  \n\nOverall, with experimentation, one gets a good sense of what's good to order at BL.  And, with that, it stands in a class by itself.  While I love Golden Lotus/Golden Era, it's Vietnamese, and these Chinese classics are not offered.  Oakland now has a place called Nature Vegetarian, which is a vegetarian Chinese restaurant, but it just hasn't delivered.  While Big Lantern is not a dedicated vegetarian restaurant, it delivers more often than not, with delicious vegetarian chicken (or meatless chicken, as they call it) that brings one back to her Chinese roots.\n\nThe only other game in town for a good Chinese vegetarian menu (other than Enjoy Vegetarian) is Wild Pepper further down in the Mission.  Wild Pepper is good, too, but leans towards the salty side.  Between the two, I prefer Big Lantern, although I think that Wild Pepper is probably more artfully prepared.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-12"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the General Meatless Chicken.

It consists of three mini pork buns, three siu mai, and three shrimp dumplings.   It is served with hot mustard and hot chili oil.  It was well made. It was not dry or greasy.  The curry puffs were interesting. It is different than the ones I am used to seeing.  The pastry is dry, flaky and sweet.  The filling is a bit dry and reddish. It looks like grounded chorizo meat. It has a strong and spicy curry flavor, but it took a while for me to notice it.  Again, it was not greasy and was well made.  Overall, I like it.  The  sweet rice tamale was good.  There was nothing really special about it.  It was flavorful and the rice had the right amount of moisture.

I did notice that the  flatware they used was above average compare to what other Chinese places use.  The stainless steel flatware had a bright polished finish and had good weight and balance.  Other Chinese places tend to use cheap, lightweight, dull, flatware that would bend easily if used to scoop slightly frozen ice cream.  Basically flatware, that is a one step higher than the free plastic  spork you get at a KFC. \n\nOverall, I was pretty happy with my visits and look forward to trying other items on their menu.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-03-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I heard someone next to me order the \"General Meatless Chicken\", so I exclaimed, again unable to control my volume, \"GENERAL MEATLESS CHICKEN!!\"\n\n"], "author": "BatBoy x.", "review": "Hi,\n\nI first came into Big Lantern by mistake running from a crowd gathered outside The Roxie and a buff guy smoking outside Kilowatt.

Plus we thought, let's order extra so we have lunch leftovers! \n\nFirst we each ordered soups (the only truly edible dishes we ordered). I got egg flower, he got west lake beef soup. They were the exact same soup but one had beef added to it and one had mushrooms added to it. I had the first bite and when the BF asked how it was I said, \"Very warm, bland, but ok.\" He took his bite and agreed. \n\nNext up we opened the fried rice. It was dark brown. It was completely drenched in soy sauce. I actually contemplated rinsing it out. I've read Susanna Foo's book, I know how non-Chinese cooks (*points to self*) ruin Chinese dishes. By adding too much soy sauce and oil. This dish is the perfect example for Susanna Foo's \"how to not make fried rice\" example. If you like drinking soy sauce then you'll love this dish. But while I do love to put soy sauce on almost every Chinese dish I order, I couldn't eat much of this. \n\nThen came the order of Chive Dumplings. This was the first dish that was spit out. I think my BF took it as a challenge to be able to prove to me he can eat anything. He barely swallowed it. I don't know how a chive dumpling can go so wrong. The chives tasted like overcooked collard greens that were rotten. The rice wrapping was even bad! It had the worst texture I've ever tasted or seen. \n\nNext we decided maybe we'll try our Beef and Broccoli. And it was decent. It was edible and not overcooked. But it was soooo over sauced. I was able to eat about 4 whole bites. \n\nAnd here comes the best part.... \n\nOk, maybe the Mu Shu Chicken will be better. BF unwraps the foil to get the mu shu wrappers and guess what he finds.... TORTILLAS. Yes. Actual Mexican tortillas. So I dish some filling onto my plate and try it first. It tastes like sugar. Seriously, I think the sauce was made out of simple syrup. I get a weird look on my face and so the BF grabs a bite and instantly spits it out and runs to the sink to rinse his mouth out. A tortilla couldn't have made it taste any better. \n\nThe only thing we both actually finished was the soup. We ripped up the take out menu and I'm posting this review to remind myself to never order from here again. I thought even \"bad Chinese food\" was supposed to be good.

Since Hunan Garden is closed on Saturday, we gave these jokers a try.   The minimum standard for good chinese delivery is speed of delivery and convenience.\r\n\r\nFirst, the delivery took about 40 minutes, as promised.  After getting spoiled by the fact that Hunan Garden always takes no more than 20 minutes despite always warning 40, this was a small disappointment.  Second, the food was terribly packaged!  Only the rice came in the traditional chinese food delivery container box, while the mu shu chicken, orange chicken, and sesame beef came in squarish styrofoam containers.  Thus, almost half the sauces and juices in those three dishes had already spilled out of the styrofoam-box-thingy by the time it came to us, soaking both the bag and making all the containers in the bag super-sloppy and wet.   These guys seriously need to invest in the fold-top doggy bags.\r\n\r\nThe mu shu chicken was the best item....they give you a ton, and although the mu shu pancakes were thin, delicate, and non-tortilla-like (which is a good thing), they proved strong and resilient against the common problem of mu shu-rupture...they easily withstood the pressures of plum sauce and over-stuffing the pancake.  Both the orange chicken and sesame beef were sitting on top of very thin and liquidy sauces.  The orange chicken was solid, with lean meaty portions of chicken. The problem was that each piece barely had any sauce on it or soaked into it, because the sauce had (sadly) already departed the flimsy container it came in.   The sesame beef had an odd sour taste with some undercooked broccollinis at all four corners.  Since most of the sesame beef sauce had already spilled out and was all over the place, it really put a damper on the festivities.     The whole point of delivery is to have a delicious, convenient pre-made meal delivered to your door, ready to eat.  The spectacular mess brought to us by Big Lantern failed on all those counts.", "rating": 2, "date": "2006-07-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Henry's Hunan is in second..."], "author": "Kenois M.", "review": "Most of the reviews of this restaurant are by vegetarians, so I thought it would be good to balance this with a review by a devout omnivore.\n\nI've actually never stepped foot in the place - I've only ordered delivery, so this review is limited to that.

It's up to you\" or \"everything is good\" or maybe a lousy suggestion of some random dish they come up with on the spot.

We started with chive dumplings, Shanghai soupy pork dumplings, stuffed mushroom, mushu pork, peking duck, and duck soup with winter melon.  I was in foodie heaven.  The big platters came next - shrimp with snow peas and lily flower; seafood medley of scallop, shrimp, squid, clams, and fish with mushrooms and snow peas; garlic spinach; tofu with bamboo skin; west lake fish (flounder filet); onion and pepper lamb.  For dessert, we each got a coconut milk egg custard tart.  It was truly sublime and easy on the wallet.  We had 8 people and it was $25-30 per person for all that food which included about 10 beers.  If that's too pricey, go for lunch or just dim sum.  The rice dishes for lunch are from $4.95 - 7, and the dim sum dishes start at $2.50.  Go.

The variety for a vegetarian at this place is IMMENSE.  I truly cannot stress enough how heavenly this place is, so I'm just going to name off a small portion of what they have to offer.\n\n- Meatless Chicken out the whazoo!  Breaded, not breaded, big chunks and little, this place is a soy chicken lover's *dream*.  Curry, General's, Sesame, Sweet & Sour, Five Spice, HONEY WALNUT!!!! - and, seriously, I think at least a dozen more.\n\n- Meatless Beef.  I can't say much about this - I never liked real beef back in my carnivore days, so I don't order it.  But if you want it, they've got it.\n\n- A lovely variety of vegetable dishes.  Black Bean Asparagus, Garlic Broccoli, Garlic Spinach, Dry Sauteed String Beans (my favorite), and on and on.\n\n- Tofu dishes, of course.\n\n- Yummy dim sum (served anytime) dishes like Taro Vegetable Puffs (HOLY GOD!!!!!), Taro Cakes, and several other vegetarian items not found at many Chinese spots.\n\n- Plus they have things like the Meatless Chicken Salad - a yummy shredded cabbage salad with a crisp coated meatless chicken \"breast\" on top, and a creamy, sweet and light dressing.  I've never had anything like it anywhere else.  When I first had it I got so hooked that I really had to keep myself from losing my shit and eating it every day.  ;)\n\nHonestly, if you are a Vegetarian I can vouch for the fact that you will love the food at this place.  It's clean, dining there is lovely, and they are quick with service and short on chitchat.  Nice folks with no language barrier.\n\nAlso, they DELIVER!
