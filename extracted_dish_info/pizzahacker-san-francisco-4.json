We go out for pizza because sometimes you just don't want to crank up the oven to 550F and bake your entire house (and for some 'industrial espionage' culling tips from the pros all over the pizza planet). Pizza Hacker came to our neighborhood and we have been converting friends and family to PzaHckr denizens whenever we don't have our own dough growing at home.\n\nPizza Hacker is top notch along side Tony's, Capo's, those NY Patsy's and Grimaldi's and better than John's, and we think superior to una pza napo. (Now that they're gone, why bother talking about them anyway). Hacker's sauces stands shoulder to shoulder with the best Nancy Silverton would make, harvested from Early Girl Tomatoes bringing this POW! The pepperoni on the Ohio has so much flavor, cups and miraculously doesn't issue an oil puddle you would find under an old Chevy with a leaking transmission. (They even shared the secret of their pep source). Tangy sauce and pepperoncini make a wondrous pizza. We've tried them all, lately we keep going back to Ohio.\n\nPizza Hacker likes to cook until their crust is stiff enough to support the toppings and get a fair amount of char on the crust. The dough tastes good, with a little yeast and some of that SF sour, but just a touch.\n\nBeer choices rotate, usually an IPA, a saison or sour, a kolsch or something light on tap. Wine and sodas too.\n\nAlways love the Intermezzo salad. Reminds us of the old days getting lunch at the Owl and Monkey. Very fresh and full of colorful beans and roots, and well tossed. The Kale Caesar is great too.\n\nPrices are fair, even pretty reasonable for San Francisco. What's to complain about? Communal tables shared with kids maybe, sometimes you have to wait, but turnover is pretty good. People who do not believe Pizza Hacker executes deliciously probably believe The Love Boat was the greatest show ever broadcast, IOW, they have little taste of substance and might be happier at \"Yard of Pizza for One Dollar\" strip mall chains.

A piping hot slice of cheeselicious pizza at 3 am always hits the spot right?\n\nSoft opening 3 weeks ago, Pizza Hacker's brick and mortar (formerly Incas) finally came into fruition after years at Dolores Park and popping up at Vinyl Coffee & Wine Bar baking pizza from a makeshift pizza oven using a Weber Grill. How cool is that?\n\nI never got to try their pizza but since Pizza Hacker's new spot is just several minutes away from me, now was my chance. \n\nThe chalkboard menu is small with just one salad and five pizza options: http://bit.ly/1fi0rvL. I don't mind small menus since it allows the chef(s) to select the best seasonal ingredients and perfect the few dishes they offer well.\n\nAll pizzas are a very reasonable $15 which includes tax. They also have one red and one white wine  ($8/glass, $30/bottle), 4 beers ($5/glass, $27 pitcher), and sodas ($3). CC's accepted.\n\nPizza Hacker is family friendly since there's picnic tables (communal seating); right to be exact and a chalk board for kids to scribble on while they await their pie: http://bit.ly/1dB8oJl. If you find yourself having to wait for a table, hit up Rock Bar (owned by Front Porch) down the block for some drinks: http://bit.ly/1avgubW. \n\nThe staff is incredibly friendly. It was our waiter's first day and he did a great job and promptly taking and delivering our order. \n\nI'm four reviews behind on my pizza reviews but Pizza Hacker is a step below Delfina's for me. My top five picks are still Una Pizza Napolatana, Pizzetta 211, Baonecci, Tony's and A16 (pending review).\n\nMaybe I choose the wrong pizza but I felt the Intermezzo Salad ($8) outshined my pizza: http://bit.ly/1mCiTBD. The salad was ginormous and was enough to feed 4-5 people. All the ingredients were uber fresh and dressed in a deliciously savory and nicely tangy poppy seed dressing. I loved the garbanzo and kidney beans for a meaty bite. Definitely one of the best salads I've had!\n\nFor my pizza, I decided to go with the Crowd Pleaser w/ Radicchio, mission figs, bleu cheese, balsamic, fresh mozzarella & rosemary ($15) since it got rave reviews from their previous Yelp reviews: http://bit.ly/19SdlCF. Plus, I'm a sucker for savory and sweet pairings. Sometimes less is more and which this was the case with the crowd pleaser as it was overwhelmed with radicchio and balsamic vinegar making the pizza too bitter and sour for my liking. The middle was immediately soggy as a result too. \n\nBeing the carniwhore that he is, Mr. NSS for the Yo Vinny: Marinated onions, goat horn peppers, 4505 hot Italian sausage, tomato sauce & fresh mozzarella ($15): http://bit.ly/1e1fJGw which I favored over the Crowd Pleaser. Everything was well balanced with a good amount of oooeeey goooey cheese and a spicy porkiness from the sausage. \n\nNow the reason why I can't rank Pizza Hacker in my top 5s is because of the crust which truly is a matter of preference. What makes Pizza Hacker's crust unique is it's sprinkled with smoked sea salt for that extra bite of flavor. However, I felt the crust was too carb heavy for me as I prefer a more light and crackly, thin crust.  Also I couldn't get over the immediate sogginess with the Crowd Pleaser. \n\nNext time, I'm going with the Rocket Man which is topped with a farm egg. Maybe that will change my mind.
