The quality of the meat was a nice slab of Niman Rancher's chuck I believe- good stuff. I ordered the Italian Stallion with sweet potato fries. The burger comes with basil, mozzarella , garlic aoli. I opted for the Gouda instead - felt right. So off the bat I notice the crabby patty sized bun-a chewey texture with a nice pull apart consistency, but a little too greasy. I ordered my burger medium well and got it medium. Big whoop I know, but the little things count and preparing your food how you ordered it should be a standard. The meat overall was good, a step up from Fatburger. I could barely trace the garlic aoli which I was looking forward to. The Gouda was not melted well onto the meat. It looked like a half ass attempt at what usually happens when I try to  make a cheeseburger, except i didn't pay near as much lol. So maybe the Gouda was not the best substitution- nonetheless still tasted descent. The portion of sweet potato fries were good and they tasted very plain with no seasoning in \"sigh\" (i crack myself up). But regrettably after lf trying the garlic fries from a colleague I had to slap myself 2x for not getting them.\n\nThe price is insane. For a burger, fries, and a bottle of h20 it cost around $20.

I normally request the fries to be made well done so it's crispy.  By far my favorite garlic fries because it has the right garlic flavor and not just straight up crushed potent garlic slapped on top of the fries.  Their Chocolate milkshake is quite popular so they run out quickly.  The Vanilla and Strawberry milkshakes are also good.  Curly fries are very good as well.
