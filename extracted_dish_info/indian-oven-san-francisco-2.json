Here's the rundown:\n\nLocation: It's right on Fillmore in Lower Haight, which is perfect for some grub before bar hopping or even just a good spot to grab dinner in general!\n\nVenue: This is a nice place. White table clothes, white napkins, candles, and rustic Indian artwork... Don't worry, it's still casual enough to get away with jeans and a hoodie -- just don't go in looking all scrubby! It's a small place, but they've strategically laid out the tables to optimize their space. On a late Monday night, the place was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table for 2. It's well lit and can get a little loud just from all the chatter at nearby tables, but you don't have to yell to be heard by the rest of your party.\n\nFood: We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (of course) and Bombay Chicken (I think that's what it was...). Instead of rice, we just got some Garlic Naan and Goat Cheese Naan. Our food came out in about 10 minutes or so, but before then, we were served an couple sheets of a crispy thin bread (almost like a cracker, but thinner) and four different toppings. One was a sweet jelly, two of them were more of a liquid consistency and were slightly spicy, and the last one had some solid pieces in there, but I still have no idea what it was.  When our food came out, they set the Chicken Tikka Masala over the little candle, which I thought was cool. It was made to hold the small serving dish and I guess it was supposed to help keep it warm. The Bombay Chicken was just served in an oblong container, no frills. The Tikka Masala was delicious! The chunks of chicken breast were still moist, and the sauce was flavorful. I scooped up the sauce with my Garlic Naan for a tasty treat. The Bombay Chicken was also pretty good, although it didn't contain those nice chunks of white chicken breast meat -- instead it was more variable pieces of meat with the skin still attached on. It did have a nice kick, which I appreciated since I love spicy food. I wasn't a big fan of the Goat Cheese Naan, though. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese to begin with, but one small slice was enough and then I just stuck to the Garlic Naan.\n\nCost: For our two dishes, Garlic Naan, and Goat Cheese Naan, our total was about $40. Kind of pricey, but we did have some leftovers. I might come back again just because it's  great location and it's good food with great service. However, I'll have to try out some other places for their Chicken Tikka Masala before claiming it's the best.\n\nLooking for tasty Indian food?

White table clothes, white napkins, candles, and rustic Indian artwork... Don't worry, it's still casual enough to get away with jeans and a hoodie -- just don't go in looking all scrubby! It's a small place, but they've strategically laid out the tables to optimize their space. On a late Monday night, the place was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table for 2. It's well lit and can get a little loud just from all the chatter at nearby tables, but you don't have to yell to be heard by the rest of your party.\n\nFood: We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (of course) and Bombay Chicken (I think that's what it was...). Instead of rice, we just got some Garlic Naan and Goat Cheese Naan.

When our food came out, they set the Chicken Tikka Masala over the little candle, which I thought was cool. It was made to hold the small serving dish and I guess it was supposed to help keep it warm. The Bombay Chicken was just served in an oblong container, no frills. The Tikka Masala was delicious! The chunks of chicken breast were still moist, and the sauce was flavorful. I scooped up the sauce with my Garlic Naan for a tasty treat. The Bombay Chicken was also pretty good, although it didn't contain those nice chunks of white chicken breast meat -- instead it was more variable pieces of meat with the skin still attached on. It did have a nice kick, which I appreciated since I love spicy food. I wasn't a big fan of the Goat Cheese Naan, though.

I moved into my new apartment September 1st and just when I thought my life couldn't possibly get any better, I discovered Indian Oven on the corner.  \n\nThe dishes and naan are amazing.  Their lamb holds flavor well while remaining fork tender and the veggie dishes are cooked to crunchy yet tender perfection.  For staples, their chicken tikka masala is superb.  The sauce is spicy and the chicken retains an incredible smokiness that rocks.  I've been in my new apartment for two weeks and I've eaten here twice already.  I'm going to be in trouble.\n\nWhen I called for take out they actually asked me how I liked my veggies cooked for the korma.  \"A little undercooked?\", he asked. Pretty sweet.\n\nLet the menu tour begin.  After reading other postings, the goat cheese naan is next on my list.  And Kingfisher beer?

As a self proclaimed Indian food connoisseur, this place has all the right things going for it. From the welcoming Nepalese staff to the smokey taste of their korma sauce, I simmered in the savory evening. \n\nIndeed, this is a \"higher end\" Indian restaurant, but there's no Dosa stick up its butt. (I love Dosa, but lets be real, it has a different vibe.) Indian Oven is warm, courteous  and mellow. \nOur party of 4 sat in the back room where it was a bit quieter and less sceney. We loved the 3 sauces and pickled veggies that came with the papadums - nice and full of flavor. The samosas were legit, crispy & filled with goodness, and paired perfectly with the sauces too. We shared 5 entrees, but probably only needed 4. However, that's what Indian at a restaurant is all about, sharing with a good group of peeps. We had the paneer korma and chicken korma, which was some of the best, most unique korma I have ever tasted. It had a smokey taste to it, almost chipotle-like, and richly delicious. I'm usually not a fan of paneer, as cheese doesn't seem to go with Indian seamlessly. However, this was awesome paneer and to boot, they had a goat cheese naan. It was an Indian quesadilla, unique and good. \nWe LOVED the fish tikka masala, it came out buttery and spicy. The saag aloo was awesome and hearty with great spices too. The lamb vindaloo was the only dish I wouldn't order again though, it just lacked moisture and good texture.\n\nMy other favorite thing was the rice pudding desert. I haven't had legit rice pudding since my days in the 'Desh. Milky, rich and sweetly spiced. \n\nOverall, it was simply amazing and I will certainly be returning soon. \n\nWell done IO, bhalo, khub bhalo.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-03-21"}, {"excerpts": ["The goat cheese Naan is awesome too!

Many of the dishes are watery thin, which is dissatisfying when eaten with naan (see all the other reviewers below that confirm this). Its as if they try to extend the kitchen's output to many customers by just adding water. Unethical, and just plain stupid. \n\nThe tables are packed so tight, you WILL feel cramped and uncomfortable no matter where you sit. Its like chickens in a coop. Some of the chairs as just impossible to get to, unless you get on tiptoe and scrape your ass past someone else's table while they eat. It's not like this is done because the place is in such popular demand - it clearly feels like the idea was to maximize the number of diners per unit area. \n\nAh yes, finally, the price. This is the kind of restaurant that uses having white tablecloths as an excuse to justify adding 30-50% more to each dish's price. If the taste was good, one could swallow these prices. Here, it just sticks out as another example of the owner's greedy efforts to squeeze profits out of the wallets of unwitting customers (at least once before they get wiser). Hopefully they will read these reviews and avoid even that one time.\n\nOh by the way, the most interesting thing about the much raved about goat cheese naan is.... you guessed it, the novelty and the price ($5), but alas, not the taste.\n\nNish N and Sav B's reviews of this place are also right on the mark, and also solve the mystery of why this place manages to get inexplicably high reviews.", "rating": 2, "date": "2008-09-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Speaking of the naan, we had the goat cheese naan.
