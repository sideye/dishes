We ordered some vegetarian imperial rolls and the seafood claypot. The vegetarian imperials rolls were unique - they had a kind of starchy bean curd in them. They only came with two, but they were decent size for 5.95. The claypot was really delicious, with fish cake, squid, and shrimp, as well as mushrooms. I thought it was well-flavored and cooked, though my wife thought the claypot was a little too salty. We also ordered some jasmine tea which was nice to have with the meal.\n\nI think the prices were definitely fair, but higher than what I think of vietnamese food costing in this part of the city - most of the entrees were $15 or higher. \n\nIt was a nice little spot, clean bathrooms, attentive service, so I could definitely see coming here again - the wide menu and wide range of prices on the menu too meant that you have a more affordable meal or a more luxurious one at the same spot.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-03-11"}, {"excerpts": ["(I had #17) and the iced jasmine tea really hit the spot on a warm day.
