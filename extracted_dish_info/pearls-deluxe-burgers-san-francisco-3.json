I ordered a peanut butter and banana malt and when they started to make it I knew it was going to be great. They started off by pouring soft serve vanilla ice cream into a big cup, then they pulled out a fresh banana, cut it up, and threw it in with the ice cream. Then they took out a jar of PB and put 3 huge scoops into the cup. To finish it off they added some malt mix and blended all the ingredients u together. Words can't explain how good this malt was, I loved it so much. Every sip I took contained pieces of fresh bananas and PB. In fact I loved their malts so much that I went back the next night and ordered a blueberry malt made with fresh blueberries. \n\nPearl's is a tad pricey. My burger, fries, and malt came to 25 dollars which is kind of expensive for a small, hole in the wall burger joint.

Where can I start?\n\nMy first time here, I was iffy about it. I mean, it's in the tenderloin and at the time, I wasn't craving a burger and wanted to go to the thai place across the street. I think picking this place over thai was the best decision I've ever made in my life. I got The Bomb burger and omggggg. The chili was perfect. The meat was cooked just right. The Nutella shake..................\n\nThe Nutella shake deserves its own paragraph. As if Nutella isn't delicious on its own, they just had to make a milkshake. I can't speak for any of the other shakes because the Nutella shake is just too good to not get so I haven't tried the others. In my opinion, it tastes exactly like a chocolate hazel Pirouette and thinking about it, makes me salivate.\n\nMoving on. I used to HATE sweet potato fries and when my friends got some, I decided to give them a try. ANOTHER great decision I've made in my life. The fries were fried just right and not too salty. Just perfect! The day after my first time here, I seriously started to get withdrawals. I missed my burger so much and every burger I've had after that day just did NOT compare. In-n-out even started to taste bad and I LOVE(D) In-n-out. I went again last weekend and got the BBQ chicken burger and that thing was HUGE. I needed a stack of napkins because of the burger. It was delicious, but not as good as The Bomb. I want to come back and try the Kobe burger that everyone is talking about. I swear thinking about this place kills me. It's just too good! The service is great. The staff is really friendly!\n\nThe only thing that disappointed me was the time changes. One night, I tried going here with my boyfriend and a couple friends (we were super excited to eat Pearl's). We got there around 12am only to find out that they changed their weekend closing time from 2am to 11pm ): But that won't change my love for Pearl's!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["Their Kobe Burger is amazing!

Definitely replace the beef patty with Kobe meat or buffalo, you won't regret it!\n\nAnd if you think the burgers are better, the fries are EVEN BETTER. Not even kidding about this, last time I came here I didn't even bother getting a burger. Went straight for the frings (fries and onion rings)! They're extra crispy because they do throw the fries in flour before frying them (so if you need to stay gluten-free, stay away from the fries). Legitimately proved I would come back here just to eat the fries. :P\n\nLast, if you love milkshakes, THEY GOT MILKSHAKES TOO. Trust me, they're excellent. Maybe don't order it with a burger and fries, that's a tad too aggressive. But ordering one on its own? Just what the doctor ordered!\n\nService here has always taken a while, but that's because they make every order only once it's been ordered. Guarantees the highest quality available! In all my times here, they've always been great to me. \n\nAnd last but not least, my last review of this place said Pearl's had sadly become cash only. Well not only do they take cards again, they have Apple Pay too! No idea about Android Pay though.\n\nNow that I'm not in NorCal anymore, I really do make it a point to come back to Pearl's every time I visit SF.

We shared a fries/onion rings half/half and a chocolate shake.\n\nVerdict: \n\n- Bula Burger: the bbq sauce overpowered the overall taste of the burger. My husband said he didn't taste the spiciness in the pineapple. Patty was cooked as described by the server (I believe medium rare, closer to pink than red?). However, the burger patty was not seasoned enough. There was an overall lack of flavor the entire burger due to the lack of seasoning. \n\n- Prized Pearl: I was incredibly disappointed with this burger. Now, I love grilled onions...but man, this burger was just overwhelmed by the grilled onions. To make matters worse, the onions were grilled in so much oil--which was transferred onto the burger itself. Basically, all I tasted was greasy grilled onions and not much else. There wasn't enough bleu cheese in the burger to cut the greasiness and overpowering onions. And similar to my husband's burger patty, the meat in my burger was very underseasoned and didn't taste like anything. \n\n- Fries/Onion rings: decent. Both items were fried to crispy yumminess. A bit greasy, but it's fried food so that's expected. \n\n- Chocolate shake: meh. Thick milkshake upon first sip, but eventually loses thickness way too quickly. Midway through, the shake just tasted like a somewhat thick Nesquick. \n\nOverall, we were underwhelmed by our experience here. I had high hopes, but they were not met.

They have a little crust around them that adds to the crunchiness.  A large size is enough to share between 3-4 people.

In this neighborhood, you're kind of used to the streets smelling a little, well, like pee.  I stepped out of the car and it did NOT smell like pee.  It DID, however, smell like poo.  Awful, stenchiriferous poo!  Apparently, someone left a bag of gross, smeary, mushy poo IN the parking spot and we rolled right over it and got poo all over the back tire.  Blech.  \n\nDid I say Blech?\n\nI meant double BLECH!!!\n\nAnyway, back to the reason of this review - we walked into Pearl's and it was packed.  There was a line to the front door and every seat was taken.  We ordered fairly quickly, but then had to stand off to the side waiting for a table to become available.  A group of three guys came in later and stood next to us waiting for a table.  A few minutes later a table opened up and you would not BELIEVE what happened.  The three guys swooped in and claimed the table.  \n\nUmm...hello?  We were here first and were waiting for a table.\n\nOur order came out and the guy told us that was totally our table and we should open up a can of of whoop ass, so \"A\", the guy with our food, and I walked over to the table and \"A\" kindly informed them we had been waiting for a table first.  The three guys were super apologetic and said they were from out of town and got up.  They told the woman behind the counter they would take their food to go instead.\n\nSo, cool that the guys let us have the table, but not cool that they swiped it in the first place.  Apparently that's what you do when you're not from San Francisco.  (I kid though.  I really appreciated that they let us have the table.  Thanks three guys from out of town!)\n\nOh, but the FOOD!  We decided to go light and split the Bula Burger, because that's the one they highlighted on \"Best in Chow.\"  We got chicken rather than beef, so it was lighter.  Definitely tasty, but maybe because, for some reason, I like pineapples in my burgers!  We also got a side of fries.  Just the fries, not the frings, or the other half/half options they offer.  They were really good fries.  I would go back just to order the fries.  Yummy, crispity goodness!  We also ordered a chocolate peanut butter shake, but I think all we got was a peanut butter shake.  It was still delicious though.\n\nWhen we were almost done eating, the owner came over to chat with us because he recognized \"A\" from \"Best in Chow.\"  Yeah, if you haven't figured it out - my darling \"A\" was one of the judges in the burger challenge!!!!  \n\nWe also let another couple share our table with us.

Most signature burgers are in the $7-9 range (without extras), the plain/ chicken/ turkey burgers and mini sizes cost less. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ#lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ Any burger can be made with buffalo meat by adding $2.49, or with Kobe beef for $3.99 more, but those meats are not available as mini.\n\nIf you've never been here before, u should know that their burgers are 1/2 lb. and the \"mini\" are 1/4 lb. (equivalent to a \"regular\" at other places). So u can split a burger with someone or order the mini version, if you're not that hungry. The special burgers are VERY messy, like that Carl's Jr. commercial with a burger that drips all over (because of the teriyaki sauce, BBQ sauce, etc).\n\nThe sides - cole slaw, garlic fries, regular fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries - are also available as combinations: Frings (fr+rings), Spries (fr+sweet fr) and Springs (sweet fr+rings). Most people rave about either the crinkle cut sweet potato fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ#YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ or the onion rings (which are similar to the ones from Jack in the Box or Burger King). Both are good.\n\nI LOVE the milkshakes - $3.49 for the regular flavors and $3.99 for the special flavors, with about 10 different flavors in each group. The mud pie shake (brownies and chocolate) is a new favorite.\n\nNo opinion on items I haven't tried yet: veggie burger, hot dog, chili, and the salads (garden, cobb, asian chicken).\n\nTips:\n\nCheck your takeout order before leaving, because mistakes can happen. One time I received 'Frings' instead of 'Springs'.\n\nAnd the kitchen can be inconsistent. One night my fries were way too salty. I didn't complain that time, because the 2 cooks looked angry. Maybe they were having a bad day. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=SikRV7WAxjrPjoLM_3V3TA#SikRV7WAxjrPjoLM_3V3TA", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["we got the bula burger, phat bob, and spicy sly with an order of garlic fries and sweet potato fries.

I got the garlic fries, small, which were $3.49, so my total came out to over $13. \n\nI got it to go and ended up eating it in my car because I was THAT hungry. Not a good idea. As good as the bula burger was, it is VERY messy! They pour that sauce on there and silly me I forgot to grab napkins - you can imagine the disaster. Anyway, the burger was amazing - big chunks of bacon, an enormous amount of spicy pineapple teriyaki sauce, and the burger was cooked to perfection - medium rare - just how I like it. I know the sauce says spicy, but its not spicy at all, and I didn't mind because it was full of flavor!\n\nThe garlic fries were also very good! \n\nI would love to come back and try their other burgers! I'm aware that there is a location on market street, however, I don't believe (based on the ratings) that it is as good as this location. Although it is located in the tenderloin, I didn't have trouble finding street parking on a Saturday evening around 4 pm. \n\nThe place is not that big, and it had a good number of people in there.

OMG I truly think they have the best malts in all of SF. \nWhat makes them so good is that they use fresh ingredients when preparing them. I ordered a peanut butter and banana malt and when they started to make it I knew it was going to be great. They started off by pouring soft serve vanilla ice cream into a big cup, then they pulled out a fresh banana, cut it up, and threw it in with the ice cream. Then they took out a jar of PB and put 3 huge scoops into the cup. To finish it off they added some malt mix and blended all the ingredients u together. Words can't explain how good this malt was, I loved it so much. Every sip I took contained pieces of fresh bananas and PB. In fact I loved their malts so much that I went back the next night and ordered a blueberry malt made with fresh blueberries. \n\nPearl's is a tad pricey.

Simply said, they get all the basics for a burger right:\n\n1)  the bun.  must be fresh, toasted, warm.  This is probably equivalent in importance to the actual meat itself because the bun touches your mouth first and is the first texture you feel as you bite down into the burger and chew it.  Pearl's gets it right, toasted, soft, chewy, with sesame seeds on top.  Don't get me started about how often this is screwed up in all the new \"gourmet\" burgers in SF.\n\n2)  the meat.  A good blend of lean meat and fat, cooked to order.  Since Pearl's actually cook it to order most the time, I go with their Bison meat which is leaner and has more flavor than the american kobe which is fatter.  The specialty burgers all have a full 1/2 lb patty which is glorious and very satisfying.\n\n3)  the cheese.  melted and hot on top.  hard to screw this one up.  decent selection of cheese.  I know they have swiss, cheddar, blue, and of course american.\n\n4) veggie condiments.  cold, fresh.  again, most places don't screw this one up.\n\nThe Bula burger is awesome:  swiss cheese melted on a huge burger cooked to order with their homemade spicy pineapple BBQ sauce and a perfectly toasted and fresh bun.   Honestly it's really hard for me NOT to order this here.\n\n The King burger (with a hot dog on top) was good too, but it didn't quite work because the hot dog just slipped right out of the bun when you bit down.  might work better if it was somehow made into a patty or chopped/sliced up.\n\nI should add:  their fries are lightly battered so they are kinda like giant tater tots.  both the regular and sweet potato fries are seriously good.  They may even be double fried because they resemble belgian fries in a way.  And the onion rings are really good too.\n\nPearl's is conveniently located 1 diagonal block from my favorite watering hole, Rye.  so yeah...

My chomping was so fast and intense that I could not control or limit my jaw.  It was like a \"limit break\" that lashed out an omni-bite on the burger.\n\nLet me describe my experience like this:\n\nEpisode 1: THE GREEN BURGER\nLIKE WATCHING HEAVEN ON ICE!... LIVE! The burger juices are so vividly unique and tasty it is as fine like a choir of angels figure skating on the ice doing open axels with trumpets flaring.  The pesto sauce I had on my burger was drowned with cheesey cheese of jack nature.  So much pesto was in the burger that the rest of the day I had hints and remnants of my delicious burger floating in my mind.\n\nEpisode II: THE DEEPTHROAT SHAKE\nThe tapioca straw for the milkshakes is just genius!  I used to suck my straw at jack in the box until my gums started bleeding before even breathing in the taste of their shake.  Here I had an experience of pleasure in deep throating mint oreo flavored goodness on the first sip!\n\nEpisode C: SULTRY ONION RINGS\nAlthough I did not have the pleasure of ordering this.. my friend ordered one for the table.  Onion ring make me orz orz orz like worshipping a false idol.  The slight spice and decadant crunch of each bite left me divorcing my old Buckhorn Grill string rings, separating from Best-o-Burger's Ring-Os, and kicking out my old Burger King Onion Rings out of the house!\n\nEpilogue: FIVE STARS NO DOUBT\nHands down... if you love burgers and live in San Francisco... this place is a must!  Just note that parking is not easy breezy, and getting a table may be hard at times as well.

I liked the sauce, but I wish I could have tasted more of the pineapple because that was the only thing that seemed to be lacking in the flavoring.  The burger as a whole was pretty good though, the patty was thick and soft, and the gooey cheese was great.\n\n2.   Phat Bob Burger- It reminded me of a Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr., but better.  The patty was supposed to be cooked medium, but it was quite pink in the middle, but I didn't mind because I like medium-rare meat.  The burger overall was decent.\n\nNote: I didn't like the way they prepared the bacon in either of the burgers.  For burgers, I like the bacon to be crispy and they can break into pieces/fracture off easily.  Instead, the bacon was not cooked as long, so it was still a little tough, which is not really my style.\n\nOverall, the burgers themselves were pretty good.

We actually walked right past it at first but the smell of frying onions and sweet and spicy teriyaki sauce turned us right back around. We walked in and true to other reviews, the place is small. There isn't a lot of seating but there is a pretty good rotation of customers and people are considerate about getting up when they are finished with their meal so other patrons can sit. \nAfter staring at the menu board for a solid 5 minutes (so many delicious choices, how do I choose?!) I decided on the pesto burger and a coconut milkshake. My sister and I did a quick conference and decided to order different burgers (me, pesto, her, the bula) and cut them in half so we could each try each others. We also ordered sweet potato fries and onion rings. After a short wait, our food was brought to our table and Oh. My. God. My pesto burger was cooked to medium perfection and was covered with an amazing basil pesto sauce, jack, mayo and tomato. My taste buds screamed with longing every second I wasn't taking a bite. After (quickly) finishing my half of the pesto burger I moved on to the bula burger (cooked medium and smothered in bacon, Swiss, mayo and spicy pineapple teriyaki sauce)...and wtf?! How is this possibly better than the pesto?! I literally didn't talk for a solid 8-10 minutes while savoring each precious bite (but did realize why each table has a well-stocked napkin dispenser. Helpful tip of the day: pull some out napkins ahead of time so you don't waste seconds while eating). \n\nAnd now on to the sides...a lot of places I've been to have either great sides or great main dishes. Not this place. The onion rings were cooked to battered perfection and the sweet potato fries were a little crisp on the outside and soft in the middle without being to mushy. The coconut milkshake I had was probably the best milkshake I've ever had. I know coconut is usually a yes or no kind of thing for people but this was a perfect blend of sweet coconut without being too overwhelming. My friend (who doesn't like coconut) gave it a try and was instantly hooked (and then rejected over and over again throughout the meal when he kept asking for another sip. Sorry buddy, get your own!) \n\nI am not at all surprised that this establishment is being featured on the Food Network and I am eagerly anticipating my own return on my next visit to San Fran.

Phat boy burger, chili cheese fries, and nutella shake.  My friend summed up Pearl's, \"You can't go wrong, I'm pretty sure nothing is healthy here.\"  Well, we didn't make any wrong choices.  All the food came out in approximately 10 minutes with my nutella shake coming out in 2-3 minutes, which was not a rich chocolate milk shake, but was nice and fluffy.  I was perfectly content with eating that for dinner, but of course that wouldn't be healthy either, and who wants to neglect the phat boy?  Not me!  BBQ sauce is the salient taste in this burger so if you don't like bbq sauce, probably wouldn't recommend this burger.  However, the bbq sauce nicely flavored the patty and complemented the fried onion rings and bacon.  The chili on the fries had a little kick, and was atop nicely cripsed fries.

The staff brings the food to you in spite of also giving you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. The 1/2 lb Deluxe, Kobe and Buffalo (as in buffalo meat, not buffalo sauce) burgers are served as standard burgers w/ the usual fixings, but we opted for the specialty burgers where you can choose to get a 1/4 or 1/2 lb patty.\n\nThe Spicy Sly packs a slow-rising burn, as the first few bites are no big deal but then you realize that you've got a great tingle going when you're halfway through the burger. The veggies are sauteed to appropriate done-ness, and the burger was cooked to medium as desired.

With a few other friends in tow, we ordered the Prized Pearl, the Spicy Sly and the Phat Bobb.\n\nSo here's the critique.  Though we ordered the burgers cooked medium, they were cooked a little too long to medium well, which created a pretty dry burger.  We liked the taste of the beef, but it was a pretty dense patty with little flavoring.  A little bit of salt, pepper & perhaps chopped onions would have gone a long way.  We liked the sesame bun, but it was also a little dry.  I prefer a Kaiser roll or a Challah roll myself.  However, we had to agree it was a good size and the condiments were excellent.\n\nThe Spicy Sly with sauteed onions, peppers, spicy sauce, jack & mayo was just spicy enough without being overpoweringly so.  It definitely had a kick, but it didn't kill your tastebuds so you couldn't enjoy the other elements of the burger.\n\nThe Phat Bobb with bacon, onion rings, bbq sauce, jack & mayo was tasty too.  The bacon was nicely crisped, the onion ring kept it's shape well and gave a satisfying crunch when bit into, and we liked that the bbq was more savory than sweet (i.e. more Cattlemen's than KC Masterpiece).\n\nThe Prized Pearl with bacon, sauteed onions, crumbled bleu cheese & mayo was good too.  Bacon makes everything better, right?  The only complaint about this one was that the bleu cheese wasn't salty enough.

I've had nearly ever special burger on the menu, and the best ones are the Phat Bob (the first one I ever had and IMO still my favorite), the Prized Pearl, and the Bula Burger. Definitely replace the beef patty with Kobe meat or buffalo, you won't regret it!\n\nAnd if you think the burgers are better, the fries are EVEN BETTER. Not even kidding about this, last time I came here I didn't even bother getting a burger. Went straight for the frings (fries and onion rings)! They're extra crispy because they do throw the fries in flour before frying them (so if you need to stay gluten-free, stay away from the fries). Legitimately proved I would come back here just to eat the fries. :P\n\nLast, if you love milkshakes, THEY GOT MILKSHAKES TOO. Trust me, they're excellent. Maybe don't order it with a burger and fries, that's a tad too aggressive. But ordering one on its own? Just what the doctor ordered!\n\nService here has always taken a while, but that's because they make every order only once it's been ordered. Guarantees the highest quality available! In all my times here, they've always been great to me. \n\nAnd last but not least, my last review of this place said Pearl's had sadly become cash only. Well not only do they take cards again, they have Apple Pay too! No idea about Android Pay though.\n\nNow that I'm not in NorCal anymore, I really do make it a point to come back to Pearl's every time I visit SF.

The server that helped us could have been a little bit friendlier--smile every now and then, girl! \n\nMy husband ordered the Bula burger (bacon, spicy pineapple, bbq sauce, jack cheese, mayo) and I ordered the Prized Pearl (bacon, bleu cheese, grilled onion, mayo). We shared a fries/onion rings half/half and a chocolate shake.\n\nVerdict: \n\n- Bula Burger: the bbq sauce overpowered the overall taste of the burger. My husband said he didn't taste the spiciness in the pineapple. Patty was cooked as described by the server (I believe medium rare, closer to pink than red?). However, the burger patty was not seasoned enough. There was an overall lack of flavor the entire burger due to the lack of seasoning. \n\n- Prized Pearl: I was incredibly disappointed with this burger. Now, I love grilled onions...but man, this burger was just overwhelmed by the grilled onions. To make matters worse, the onions were grilled in so much oil--which was transferred onto the burger itself. Basically, all I tasted was greasy grilled onions and not much else. There wasn't enough bleu cheese in the burger to cut the greasiness and overpowering onions. And similar to my husband's burger patty, the meat in my burger was very underseasoned and didn't taste like anything. \n\n- Fries/Onion rings: decent. Both items were fried to crispy yumminess. A bit greasy, but it's fried food so that's expected. \n\n- Chocolate shake: meh. Thick milkshake upon first sip, but eventually loses thickness way too quickly. Midway through, the shake just tasted like a somewhat thick Nesquick. \n\nOverall, we were underwhelmed by our experience here. I had high hopes, but they were not met.

Luckily, we had cash, but they do have an ATM as a backup.  I don't actually have an ATM card (long story), so it wouldn't have helped me as much as correct information on Yelp would.

It wasn't bad chili, as in overly greasy, or made with crap ingredients or anything, it just wasn't my particular preference, crossing a bit more over into the sweeter notes.

After a long day of walking around, discovering how not to hang out of a street car, and watching scores of cat owners flee a burning building while the fire department do a stellar job of sorting out the whole sorry affair, I was knackered (that's British for \"pooped\") - not to mention the jet lag and hayfever. It was time for a break. So, on the recommendation of a friend I decided to find Pearl's - I looked on the map. \"What luck, it's across from my hostel!\" I thankfully didn't exclaim in the breakout area of the hostel.\n\nI closed my laptop lid, splashed some water on my increasingly tired-and-showing-it face and headed across the road for some much-needed nourishment.\n\nI decided to keep it simple; blue cheese on a burger, with everything else on it (except mayo). The friendly lady asked \"what kind of fries would you like?\" and despite replying with \"yes please\" in my almost-passing-out state, she agreed to get me some small fries.\n\nI waited patiently with another diner-to-be who was passing the time by playing some Farmville on his phone. \"Why,\" I wondered, \"would a grown man play Farmville at all, let alone on his phone?\"\n\nSoon my attention was diverted elsewhere though, as I noticed in horror my terrible mistake: the mistake of not properly reading the menu. Had I known that I could have ordered a burger with pesto on it, or with avocado, or perhaps a kobe beef burger instead, then I would have gone with one of those. \"Alas,\" I mourned, \"My first meal in this city I have longed to enjoy for so long is going to be mediocritised by this... this... 'DE-LUXE' burger; this standard, run-of-the-mill burger whose only notable trait is the addition is blue cheese instead of the normal, plasticy, film-thin cheese normally found in burgers.\"\n\nSoon it was too late - I was to face my fate. Pearl (or whom I assumed to be Pearl) handed me my brown paper bag. I forced a smile and thanked her, thinking only of what could have been between myself and the pesto burger. I walked slowly down the street towards Union Square, replaying the scene in my mind as I ate the delicious fries that were crunchy on the outside yet moist and soft on the inside. As I savoured the delicious flavour of their seasoning I wondered if I would ever again get a chance to try the Spicy Sly or the Prized Pearl. \n\nSoon I reached my destination - the stage where the final act of this tragedy would be shown: Union Square. I sat on a bench; a pigeon eyed my food, and seemed to turn its beak up and fly away. A man walked by with a dog and the dog seemed to whimper at the thought of such a shameful excuse for a burger.\n\nI reached into the paper bag, and pulled out the sturdy plastic container which held the burger with absolutely no leakage of juices or dampening, like what one would expect with some burger joints.\n\nI placed it on my knee, prized open the lid and beheld it in all its dreadful normalcy. Although it appeared large and juicy, I knew the truth - I knew that it was merely a mockery of the wide and exciting array of burgers which were otherwise available to me.\n\nI picked it up with two hands. My muscles almost straining from the mass, I managed to bring the sandwich to my lips, open them up, and make a small bite into the burger.\n\nI chewed slowly, expecting the worst: mere satiation. And yet, something was not right. Not only was this burger satiating... it was satisfying, nay; it was a pleasure. It was as juicy as it looked, and the description used for the fries earlier would apply just as readily to the buns surrounding the patty.\n\nThe generosity with which Pearl offers up onions is matched only by the perfect ripeness of the tomatoes, crunchiness of the lettuce and tanginess of the blue cheese. This truly was an excellent burger. Perhaps one of the best I have ever eaten.\n\nPearl, you have not disappointed. This was an excellent twist in a tale which set me up to expect the minimum, and you went above and beyond the call of duty. It was exactly what I needed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I won't be coming back for my pesto burger.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-06-04"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the \"Prized Pearl Burger\" and the \"Springs\" (half onion rings, half sweet potato fries).

With a few other friends in tow, we ordered the Prized Pearl, the Spicy Sly and the Phat Bobb.\n\nSo here's the critique.  Though we ordered the burgers cooked medium, they were cooked a little too long to medium well, which created a pretty dry burger.  We liked the taste of the beef, but it was a pretty dense patty with little flavoring.  A little bit of salt, pepper & perhaps chopped onions would have gone a long way.  We liked the sesame bun, but it was also a little dry.  I prefer a Kaiser roll or a Challah roll myself.  However, we had to agree it was a good size and the condiments were excellent.\n\nThe Spicy Sly with sauteed onions, peppers, spicy sauce, jack & mayo was just spicy enough without being overpoweringly so.  It definitely had a kick, but it didn't kill your tastebuds so you couldn't enjoy the other elements of the burger.\n\nThe Phat Bobb with bacon, onion rings, bbq sauce, jack & mayo was tasty too.  The bacon was nicely crisped, the onion ring kept it's shape well and gave a satisfying crunch when bit into, and we liked that the bbq was more savory than sweet (i.e. more Cattlemen's than KC Masterpiece).\n\nThe Prized Pearl with bacon, sauteed onions, crumbled bleu cheese & mayo was good too.  Bacon makes everything better, right?  The only complaint about this one was that the bleu cheese wasn't salty enough.

Then I learned that Pearl's won \"Best Burger\" challenge at the Great American Food and Music Festival, with celebrity judges Bobby Flay and Anne Burrell (no relation to Ty Burrell of Modern Family or the World Champion Pat Burrell).\n\nSuch enormous pub was enough to catapult Pearl's to the top of my bookmark list.

After a long day of walking around, discovering how not to hang out of a street car, and watching scores of cat owners flee a burning building while the fire department do a stellar job of sorting out the whole sorry affair, I was knackered (that's British for \"pooped\") - not to mention the jet lag and hayfever. It was time for a break. So, on the recommendation of a friend I decided to find Pearl's - I looked on the map. \"What luck, it's across from my hostel!\" I thankfully didn't exclaim in the breakout area of the hostel.\n\nI closed my laptop lid, splashed some water on my increasingly tired-and-showing-it face and headed across the road for some much-needed nourishment.\n\nI decided to keep it simple; blue cheese on a burger, with everything else on it (except mayo). The friendly lady asked \"what kind of fries would you like?\" and despite replying with \"yes please\" in my almost-passing-out state, she agreed to get me some small fries.\n\nI waited patiently with another diner-to-be who was passing the time by playing some Farmville on his phone. \"Why,\" I wondered, \"would a grown man play Farmville at all, let alone on his phone?\"\n\nSoon my attention was diverted elsewhere though, as I noticed in horror my terrible mistake: the mistake of not properly reading the menu. Had I known that I could have ordered a burger with pesto on it, or with avocado, or perhaps a kobe beef burger instead, then I would have gone with one of those. \"Alas,\" I mourned, \"My first meal in this city I have longed to enjoy for so long is going to be mediocritised by this... this... 'DE-LUXE' burger; this standard, run-of-the-mill burger whose only notable trait is the addition is blue cheese instead of the normal, plasticy, film-thin cheese normally found in burgers.\"\n\nSoon it was too late - I was to face my fate. Pearl (or whom I assumed to be Pearl) handed me my brown paper bag. I forced a smile and thanked her, thinking only of what could have been between myself and the pesto burger. I walked slowly down the street towards Union Square, replaying the scene in my mind as I ate the delicious fries that were crunchy on the outside yet moist and soft on the inside. As I savoured the delicious flavour of their seasoning I wondered if I would ever again get a chance to try the Spicy Sly or the Prized Pearl. \n\nSoon I reached my destination - the stage where the final act of this tragedy would be shown: Union Square. I sat on a bench; a pigeon eyed my food, and seemed to turn its beak up and fly away. A man walked by with a dog and the dog seemed to whimper at the thought of such a shameful excuse for a burger.\n\nI reached into the paper bag, and pulled out the sturdy plastic container which held the burger with absolutely no leakage of juices or dampening, like what one would expect with some burger joints.\n\nI placed it on my knee, prized open the lid and beheld it in all its dreadful normalcy. Although it appeared large and juicy, I knew the truth - I knew that it was merely a mockery of the wide and exciting array of burgers which were otherwise available to me.\n\nI picked it up with two hands. My muscles almost straining from the mass, I managed to bring the sandwich to my lips, open them up, and make a small bite into the burger.\n\nI chewed slowly, expecting the worst: mere satiation. And yet, something was not right. Not only was this burger satiating... it was satisfying, nay; it was a pleasure. It was as juicy as it looked, and the description used for the fries earlier would apply just as readily to the buns surrounding the patty.\n\nThe generosity with which Pearl offers up onions is matched only by the perfect ripeness of the tomatoes, crunchiness of the lettuce and tanginess of the blue cheese. This truly was an excellent burger. Perhaps one of the best I have ever eaten.\n\nPearl, you have not disappointed. This was an excellent twist in a tale which set me up to expect the minimum, and you went above and beyond the call of duty. It was exactly what I needed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I won't be coming back for my pesto burger.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-06-04"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the 'Spicy Sly' Grilled Chicken sandwich (saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers spicy sauce, jack & mayo).

Ok it's not that terrible for you, but it felt like it after eating 2 burgers.\n\nThe interior has a diner-like feel from the bright red and white in spite of the lack of booths, but most importantly, this place is CLEAN. The staff brings the food to you in spite of also giving you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. The 1/2 lb Deluxe, Kobe and Buffalo (as in buffalo meat, not buffalo sauce) burgers are served as standard burgers w/ the usual fixings, but we opted for the specialty burgers where you can choose to get a 1/4 or 1/2 lb patty.\n\nThe Spicy Sly packs a slow-rising burn, as the first few bites are no big deal but then you realize that you've got a great tingle going when you're halfway through the burger. The veggies are sauteed to appropriate done-ness, and the burger was cooked to medium as desired. The Phat Bobb was a bacon-burger like none other: this place serves fairly thick cuts of bacon and packs it in, to the point where I was completely distracted from any possibility of onion rings (no seriously, I don't remember if there were onion rings in my burger). For their garlic fries, they don't use garlic powder or flavored oil but instead put an ample amount of raw minced garlic on top of the fries, amazing! The chili cheese fries were a little disappointing as the chili seemed to consist entirely of beans (no onions, no meat, just beans), but the fries are batter-fried (a la Burger King style) so they have great texture. Additionally, you can get unlimited kosher pickle spears next to the soda machine. My only other complaint is that the bun is rather plain and flimsy and I wish it was made of heartier stuff, but then again, at the end of 1/2 lb burger x2 with 1/2 an order of chili cheese fries, your body will probably thank you for avoiding the additional carbs.\n\nThe prices here are really reasonable, and they serve a multitude of ice cream shakes (although I'm not sure if they use soft serve as there is a soft serve machine plainly visible at the register) as well as beer.

With a few other friends in tow, we ordered the Prized Pearl, the Spicy Sly and the Phat Bobb.\n\nSo here's the critique.  Though we ordered the burgers cooked medium, they were cooked a little too long to medium well, which created a pretty dry burger.  We liked the taste of the beef, but it was a pretty dense patty with little flavoring.  A little bit of salt, pepper & perhaps chopped onions would have gone a long way.  We liked the sesame bun, but it was also a little dry.  I prefer a Kaiser roll or a Challah roll myself.  However, we had to agree it was a good size and the condiments were excellent.\n\nThe Spicy Sly with sauteed onions, peppers, spicy sauce, jack & mayo was just spicy enough without being overpoweringly so.  It definitely had a kick, but it didn't kill your tastebuds so you couldn't enjoy the other elements of the burger.\n\nThe Phat Bobb with bacon, onion rings, bbq sauce, jack & mayo was tasty too.  The bacon was nicely crisped, the onion ring kept it's shape well and gave a satisfying crunch when bit into, and we liked that the bbq was more savory than sweet (i.e. more Cattlemen's than KC Masterpiece).\n\nThe Prized Pearl with bacon, sauteed onions, crumbled bleu cheese & mayo was good too.  Bacon makes everything better, right?  The only complaint about this one was that the bleu cheese wasn't salty enough.

"], "author": "Fong L.", "review": "Pearl's is one of my top five burger joints in the city.\nIt is quite possibly the best burger in the city--and the whole bay.  Simply said, they get all the basics for a burger right:\n\n1)  the bun.  must be fresh, toasted, warm.  This is probably equivalent in importance to the actual meat itself because the bun touches your mouth first and is the first texture you feel as you bite down into the burger and chew it.  Pearl's gets it right, toasted, soft, chewy, with sesame seeds on top.  Don't get me started about how often this is screwed up in all the new \"gourmet\" burgers in SF.\n\n2)  the meat.  A good blend of lean meat and fat, cooked to order.  Since Pearl's actually cook it to order most the time, I go with their Bison meat which is leaner and has more flavor than the american kobe which is fatter.  The specialty burgers all have a full 1/2 lb patty which is glorious and very satisfying.\n\n3)  the cheese.  melted and hot on top.  hard to screw this one up.  decent selection of cheese.  I know they have swiss, cheddar, blue, and of course american.\n\n4) veggie condiments.  cold, fresh.  again, most places don't screw this one up.\n\nThe Bula burger is awesome:  swiss cheese melted on a huge burger cooked to order with their homemade spicy pineapple BBQ sauce and a perfectly toasted and fresh bun.   Honestly it's really hard for me NOT to order this here.\n\n The King burger (with a hot dog on top) was good too, but it didn't quite work because the hot dog just slipped right out of the bun when you bit down.  might work better if it was somehow made into a patty or chopped/sliced up.\n\nI should add:  their fries are lightly battered so they are kinda like giant tater tots.  both the regular and sweet potato fries are seriously good.  They may even be double fried because they resemble belgian fries in a way.  And the onion rings are really good too.\n\nPearl's is conveniently located 1 diagonal block from my favorite watering hole, Rye.  so yeah...

However, I danced and hooked up with *that guy* all night long and we decided to forego the early morning grub for the dessert of each other and so at 2:30pm I was RAVENOUS.

Or if they had actually paid for them and grabbed it after the fact.  Who knows?  But that's how packed it was.  The menu board was handy:  Burgers listed at $6.99 to $14.99, from Turkey to  Buffalo, respectively.  Sides and milkshakes also listed.\n\n+ Service +\nThe girl was cute, so no issue.

I ordered it medium rare and expected a lot of juiciness, but didn't get it.  Overall, not a bad choice.\n~ Kobe Burger with jack cheese ($13.49):  This was bigger than the Pearl Deluxe!  The burger and all it's fixings were freakin' huge.  Like I previously mentioned and at first glance, \"sometimes you just can't enjoy it in that fashion\".  Plus big bites of a dry bun aren't fun.  The kobe patty itself was like a steak, yet leaner.  It's what I expected.  Loved the patty, medium-rare as well.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  Stick with a Pearl Deluxe.  \n\n++ Overall impression ++   \nWasn't too impressed really.  I did enjoy the free chocolate shake I was given, since no one claimed it, so the manager gave it to me.

Most signature burgers are in the $7-9 range (without extras), the plain/ chicken/ turkey burgers and mini sizes cost less. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ#lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ Any burger can be made with buffalo meat by adding $2.49, or with Kobe beef for $3.99 more, but those meats are not available as mini.\n\nIf you've never been here before, u should know that their burgers are 1/2 lb. and the \"mini\" are 1/4 lb. (equivalent to a \"regular\" at other places). So u can split a burger with someone or order the mini version, if you're not that hungry. The special burgers are VERY messy, like that Carl's Jr. commercial with a burger that drips all over (because of the teriyaki sauce, BBQ sauce, etc).\n\nThe sides - cole slaw, garlic fries, regular fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries - are also available as combinations: Frings (fr+rings), Spries (fr+sweet fr) and Springs (sweet fr+rings). Most people rave about either the crinkle cut sweet potato fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ#YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ or the onion rings (which are similar to the ones from Jack in the Box or Burger King). Both are good.\n\nI LOVE the milkshakes - $3.49 for the regular flavors and $3.99 for the special flavors, with about 10 different flavors in each group. The mud pie shake (brownies and chocolate) is a new favorite.\n\nNo opinion on items I haven't tried yet: veggie burger, hot dog, chili, and the salads (garden, cobb, asian chicken).\n\nTips:\n\nCheck your takeout order before leaving, because mistakes can happen. One time I received 'Frings' instead of 'Springs'.\n\nAnd the kitchen can be inconsistent. One night my fries were way too salty. I didn't complain that time, because the 2 cooks looked angry.

The sweet potato fries were cooked well, had a nice texture though maybe not crunchy enough for some people and were unevenly salted, but otherwise very good. \n\nThe pesto burger, cooked medium rare was pretty darn perfect. I ate almost the whole thing except for maybe a third of the bun. Most of the time when I order a burger elsewhere, I leave most of the bread behind because most other places make their burgers so dry, that having to eat all that dry bread along with the dry meat would be a real chore for me. No such worries at Pearl's. My burger meat was juicy and flavorful, topped with a generous slice of Jack cheese (no paper-thin, barely visible cheese here) and lovingly slathered with enough pesto sauce to leak out of the sides with each bite.  \n\nYou'll need at least 4-5 napkins... No use trying to look cute, prim or proper while eating this burger. Go ahead, take that big ass bite. No one else is looking at you.

I've learned some new tips for eating at Pearl's though...so follow some simple steps to a streamlined visit to Pearl's.\n\n1. Know what you're going to order or others ahead of you. Most times they're regulars and don't want to be rude and tell you, \"are you ready yet?\"\n\n2. Know which type of  protein you're going to pick out. Is it the Estancia? The Mini? The chicken burger? What temp? Be prepared people 'cause there are lots of options here.\n\n3. Fries? Strings? Frings? Springs? Milkshakes? There's like 20 different options so again, know what the hell you're doing. I empathize with newbies overwhelmed but be strong and firm about selections 'cause you just can't go wrong with any of them.\n\n4. Have money ready at all times. (a $20 should suffice.) For my mini Phat Bob, order of Springs and a chocolate banana milkshake, it usually comes out to about $15 and the change which goes directly into the \"Sex People Tip Jar.\" Who can argue with that logic really?\n\n5. When  you receive said bundles of joy promptly delivered by the cooks usually (and I have no idea how they who ordered what but they do), I advise taking rings and possibly your watch off and secure them in a pocket. Why? The juices-that's why. You'll be so busy wiping beef juice and habanero pumpkin, bbq, or pineapple sauce off your fingers, why not save your poor jewelry some damage? I found my burger trying to make a run down my sleeve the last time and luckily my watch was already in my jacket. Whew!\n\n6. If dining in, I suggest a counter spot if possible so you can get some sufficient people watching in and enjoy a nice breeze by the window. You can relish in the fact that you're enjoying one of San Francisco's best burgers and at the same time make others jealous when they see the joy on your face.\n\nMy latest recommendation is the Phat Bob. Organic beef with jack cheese, bbq sauce and two fat onion rings paired with a side of sweet potato fries can never do you wrong. My last visit to Pearl's took 20 minutes from counter to mouth wiping. It was that damn good. Take my recommendation and save yourself the heartache of lowering your standards to a place like Jack in the Box of Burger Joint. Eat at Pearl's and support local business.

Sounds like Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger, but Phat Bob makes this chain classic look super wimpy. Its seriously that good. No, good is an understatement. It was so good, that I mistaken my tongue for the burger! I chomped on it so bad that it left a nasty purple bruise.\n\nOther creations include The Bomb Burger - which is your basic chili cheeseburger, but overloaded so that it is served to you open faced. Knife & fork required.\n\nSides are your typical fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. Or you can combo it up with clever word likes Spries (Sweet potato fries/fries), Springs (Sweet potato fries/onion rings), and Frings (fries/onion rings). They even have buffalo - but I'll come back for that another day.\n\nIf you are hungry and don't know what to get, I advise to go with a friend or eating buddy - so you can order a variety and share (^_^)!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-09-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The Bula Burger with buffalo meat and an order of springs"], "author": "Chung N.", "review": "The Bula Burger with buffalo meat and an order of springs, I think (a basket of onion rings and sweet potato fries).\n\nThis is one of the best... oh hell, it's the best burger I've had in a while.\n\nThe raves are well-deserved!

YOU ARE THE BEST IN ALLLLLLLLL THE WEST!!!!\n\nSo... you know how you hear those stories of those guys in Japan falling in love with pillows and marrying them? That's sort of how I feel about the burgers at Pearl's. Although I don't know how our marriage would work out in the end... If I got married to a Pearl's Burger I'd probably end up eating my spouse on our honeymoon and end up in jail for murder... So maybe I'll just not do that.\n\nRandom anecdote aside, Pearl's is the place to be if you really like good meat. You can choose from 4 different types of beef to have in your burger, all at varying prices. The basic beef is Nieman Ranch, then they have Estancia (which is from Uruguay, free-range, grass-fed, etc etc etc), then there is Buffalo (which actually has less calories, fat and cholesterol than chicken), and the highest grade is, of course, kobe beef. I honestly am perfectly happy with the \"basic\" Nieman Ranch, but knock yourself out if you feel like it.\n\nThey have awesome fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings, and you can get different combos if you like (ie. frings, springs,spries). Make sure to load up on ranch for your dipping pleasure as well.\n\nWhile seating is limited and the ambiance is not the most amazing, it doesn't even matter! The food more than makes up for the fluorescent lighting!!!\n\nMy personal favorite order: Pearl's Deluxe Burger with bacon and bleu cheese, with a side of frings (fries & onion rings) and a diet coke (you know, because I'm OBVIOUSLY on a diet).\n\nAnd yes, I do eat here once a week.

Apparently that buffalo is some good stuff.\n\nOther random things I like about Pearl's:  The employees are super friendly.  They conveniently put all of their condiments up on the counter, and they have lots of dill pickle spears in a tub, so you can take a few as you please to go with your food.  The little dine-in area is nice and breezy when the front window is open (great for warm afternoons).

Most signature burgers are in the $7-9 range (without extras), the plain/ chicken/ turkey burgers and mini sizes cost less. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ#lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ Any burger can be made with buffalo meat by adding $2.49, or with Kobe beef for $3.99 more, but those meats are not available as mini.\n\nIf you've never been here before, u should know that their burgers are 1/2 lb. and the \"mini\" are 1/4 lb. (equivalent to a \"regular\" at other places). So u can split a burger with someone or order the mini version, if you're not that hungry. The special burgers are VERY messy, like that Carl's Jr. commercial with a burger that drips all over (because of the teriyaki sauce, BBQ sauce, etc).\n\nThe sides - cole slaw, garlic fries, regular fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries - are also available as combinations: Frings (fr+rings), Spries (fr+sweet fr) and Springs (sweet fr+rings). Most people rave about either the crinkle cut sweet potato fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ#YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ or the onion rings (which are similar to the ones from Jack in the Box or Burger King). Both are good.\n\nI LOVE the milkshakes - $3.49 for the regular flavors and $3.99 for the special flavors, with about 10 different flavors in each group. The mud pie shake (brownies and chocolate) is a new favorite.\n\nNo opinion on items I haven't tried yet: veggie burger, hot dog, chili, and the salads (garden, cobb, asian chicken).\n\nTips:\n\nCheck your takeout order before leaving, because mistakes can happen. One time I received 'Frings' instead of 'Springs'.\n\nAnd the kitchen can be inconsistent. One night my fries were way too salty. I didn't complain that time, because the 2 cooks looked angry. Maybe they were having a bad day. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=SikRV7WAxjrPjoLM_3V3TA#SikRV7WAxjrPjoLM_3V3TA", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered a side of spries.

For the people who can't decide on fries or sweet potato fries, Pearl's has the option of getting both: Spries!\n\nIt took about 5-10 minutes for our orders to arrive. Typically at these pay and sit down kind of joints, you have to pick up your food when your number is called. The workers actually brought us our side of piping hot spries and delicious burgers to our table. Good service! While I was eating, I noticed that the workers also bus the tables right after a person is finished eating which is a plus! \n\nThe burgers are freaking delish man! Just the right size (cashier mentioned that the mini burgers are 8oz and deluxe are 12oz) and the fries are amazing! Possibly the best fries from a burger joint that I've ever had.

Cheese was thoroughly melted, but not liquified or allowed to brown/burn on the grill.  Bun was good, soft, and just slightly chewy.  Lettuce was fresh.  Good mayo.  \n\nThe place is a tad on the spendy side, around $12-15 per person for a burger, fries, and a drink, but it's also a pretty damn big burger and the food quality is a cut above.

The basic beef is Nieman Ranch, then they have Estancia (which is from Uruguay, free-range, grass-fed, etc etc etc), then there is Buffalo (which actually has less calories, fat and cholesterol than chicken), and the highest grade is, of course, kobe beef.

Well played, Mr. Chappelle. Yet clearly, you have not had the burger at Pearl's? For the burger at Pearl's is juicy, pink, delicious, and yes, TENDER. So you see sir, the Tenderloin is about more than just \"smoking crack in front of Starbucks,\" the Tenderloin is about...well, it's about...(cough)...I dunno but we had a really good burger there.\n\nThe burger at Pearl's has been heralded by Tyler Florence and other fancy-panted celebrity chefs as one of the premier burgers in San Francisco. Pearl's is not a fancy restaurant (and I'd be hesitant to recommend an aspiring restaurateur to establish a ritzy place in the 'Loin) but you could easily find their burger in any upscale establishment. The 1/2 lb burger had a fancy weight, size and look and was quite good. We were somewhat disappointed to find out that Pearl's was not serving any of their top-notch meat - Niman Ranch, Kobe, or Buffalo - that we had seen highlighted in a publicity reel, but the FavCo Ranch substitute proved to be a worthy opponent. Our burgers were cooked perfectly-reddish pink throughout with a thin layer of brown encompassing the patty, which for some reason kept reminding me of an inside-out red M&M. The texture and consistency of the patty were great, although I thought the burger could have used a bit of seasoning to bring out more of that beefy flavor. The accouterments seemed fresh and the bun was proportional and springy. Note: Pearl's does not have a liquor license. Like bacon-chocolate, this sounds like a bad thing, but is not! Unable to purchase a beer at Pearl's, we purchased the 22 oz. beverage of our choice at a nearby corner store (Charlie would say \"bodega\" because he's east coasty like that)  and brown-bagged it into Pearl's. We came to find out that Pearl's wasn't BYOB either - uh oh - but the nice lady behind the counter (strongly) suggested that we pour our beers (quickly and discreetly) into large paper soda cups she provided. Win-win! Right?\n\n\nSize: 1/2 pound (their mini burgers are 1/4 pound)\nRanch: New Zealand's FavCo Ranch...although because the internets couldn't find their website for me, my doubts as to whether this \"FavCo Ranch\" actually exists will remain very high.\nMeat: Cow\nAccouterments: Arrives pre-assembled with lettuce, tomato, mayo and enough red onions to render your breath absolutely repulsive. Added cheddar cheese.\n\nBeer with burger: Ballast Point Big Eye IPA (from corner store)\n\nBeer availability: None. This place is as dry as a nun's gusset! I'm Rick James, bitch!\n\nAmbiance: And so we break our streak of uppity yuppity/bougie places, with Pearl's. Pearl's is a small burger joint, with a handful of two-tops and a street-facing counter that seats maybe four. It is brightly lit inside (although not easily spotted from the street) and very clean. The staff is friendly, efficient and informative. For most folks, it's the kind of place where you wouldn't imagine spending more than half an hour of your time. In fact, many of the patrons took their burger to go, but we are not most patrons! We beat out three generations of customers in staying past our welcome!

As per a stellar yelp review, neighborhood savory hearsay, and the agreement we'd go 'mom &pop' vs. 'gourmet'- Pearl's Deluxe Burgers was the mark for this reconnaissance mission on this warm San Francisco night. \n\nThe venue was straight to point. No frills, no pretentiousness . This is a business that boasts 'we sell damn good burgers here' nothing more nothing less. That was noted from the get-go and the joint was conducive for our no- mercy burger examination that was to follow. \n\nWe wanted to a good variety to sample. Four girls, 3 burgers to share in attack:  Pearl's Deluxe w/ Blue Cheese (for the classic), Phat Bob w/ Buffalo Meat (for the girth), and the Pesto Burger (for kicks). \nOf course we had to see what the Spries (sweet potato fries) was about, which we got laced with crunchy sweet onion rings. \n\nThe notes:  An obvious respect (if not worship) of the meat as the big boss in the bun; grilled perfectly medium/ medium rare. Whether it was the blue cheese, pesto, or bbq sauce in each of these burgers cases- the condiments were careful not to mask taste but accentuate; the bun buttery and light in a happy soft embrace of the beef. And every bit was bite-able and fat with taste. The attention to detail was exciting- props to the architecture of each.  There was surprisingly nothing but a harmony of yums and oohs that came from our table. \n\nQuotes: \n\"Despite the medley of flavors in a single burger, my taste buds and olfactory system were surprisingly not overwhelmed.\" \n\n\"I don't usually like blue cheese, but the combination of blue cheese, red onions lettuce and sauce made it fantastic!\"\n\n\"pesto burger a surprise and the buffalo meat very tasty with just enough spices.\"\n\nConclusion: Based on the varied elements of our sample tonigh, we agreed the burger to build next time would be a Pearl's Deluxe/ buffalo meat/blue cheese/ and bacon. No joke. That'll be the winner. That, and the spries (couldn't take one bite without the 'that's good' nod). And lastly, the staff.
