An hour has passed and we still did not have any water, rice, and the noodle dish. After waving to our server again and finally getting her attention, she informed us they were still making the dish. We complained we had no rice but not to bother because all the dishes were pretty much gone (yes, very small portions which seems strange because other tables seemed to get larger portions than ours. Several minutes later, the noodles came out. Hong Kong style? Yes it looked dry and crispy on the edges and moist in the middle. Hmmmm. Didn't we order beef? Didn't she say beef? Excuse me but this is chicken. We would have kept the chicken but she quickly grabbed the plate. 10 minutes or so later, a very full plate came back filled with soggy noodles. We debated if everything was new or did they just remove the chicken and piled it high with beef (chicken pieces were found under all that) it was recycled from the chicken noodles they brought first.\n\nFor me, the best dish was the oxtail clay pot. Only missing was rice. But again, portions were small.\n\nFacilities review: single narrow bathroom. It was dirty and narrow. At least it had a second area :where the sink was.

The place is populated and the two of us were able to get a place by the window.  Since we were on a budget, we ordered only braised tofu clay pot and stir fried beef chow fun.  The free tea was made with actual tea leaves, not a tea bag, so it was a definite plus.  \n\nThe clay pot dish arriving popping hot and looked well prepared,  not something just scooped out of a huge caldron and plopped into a bowl.  The braised tofu was cooked with bak choy and meaty mushrooms.  It wasn't so salty, greasy and packed with MSG as one would expect from a small restaurant.  The stir fried beef chow fun was good, too.  The beef was tender and the noodles weren't not drowning in grease and soy sauce.    \n\nWith a bowl of rice and these two dishes, the grand total including tax came to $16.75.

So the flavor must be acceptable at the least.  Some odd things I noticed was the presence of black bean and the use of green bell peppers.  The dish typically is oyster sauce-based so having black beans was strange.  The typically vegetable side should be the Chinese broccoli or \"kai lan\" but they used green pepper instead.  Again, strange.\n\nFor those who are Chinese or are familiar, the sweet ending is the traditional sweet bean soup which they offered us.  It was slightly sweeter and thicker than I would've liked but I don't typically like the sweet soup.\n\nThis is good place to eat if you are looking for a simple down-home meal.

I spent significant effort convincing my friends to get Chinese food this night, and after they finally agreed we ended up with this...\n\nSpent about 1hr in line to get in.  The line sucks.  The restaurant is on the 2nd floor, and so you line up on this skinny stairway leading up, and every once in a while a cook would come down with containers of trash so that you can see all the wonderful stuffs they want to get out of the restaurant.  One hour.\n\nThen we sat down.  They took our order.  ONE ANNNNDDDD A HALF!!!!!! hours later we get our first dish.  Let me repeat: 1.5hrs between taking our order and serving our first dish.  And yes, we asked what was going on.  There was a guy that came by, and after we inquired, he would say multiple times, \"I don't work here but I am helping out.  I am a customer.\"  ...Yeah, um, right... that's what I thought too.  Look, I'm Chinese.  I've eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants.  Usually the food comes faster than at your typical American places.  So, 1.5hr to cook is something special.  Something very special indeed.\n\nSo fine, the food:\n\n1. Steamed Black Bass Fish $15.95: Holy crap!  The fish was quite small and falling apart when it arrived.  Just look at my pictures.  It's a mess.  Tasted normal, but not any better than I can cook at home just steaming a fish from Ranch 99 with some soy sauce and sesame oil on top.  $16!  Gawd.  2/10\n\n2. Chicken Fried Rice $7.95:  (No I didn't order this... see person with far lighter skin to my left.)  So, it's fried rice with pieces of chicken.  I guess it was alright.  Not much to say.  5/10.\n\n3. Honey Walnut Prawns $8.50: Well, I've had this dish many dozens of times.  This one was the worst of the bottom 1/3rd or so.  The batter was not crispy... a tad soggy.  Walnuts and mayo sauce were fine.  The shrimp itself wasn't overcooked.  But well, being soggy kinda kills it.  4/10\n\n4. Snow Pea Sprouts w/ Garlic $8.50: Ahhhhh.... such a needed break--this one was excellent.  Nothing over-the-top.  Just well cooked and seasoned, in a simply traditional fashion.  Vegetables tasted fresh.  7/10\n\n5. Beef Stew in Clay Pot $8.50:  Too much tofu.  And too much of the chewy tissue Chinese use from stewing meat.  You can see that stuff rolled up in cylinders in the pictures.  It was also not cooked long enough so I think most people either threw it away or spit it out.  The beef itself was alright, but there was far less of that than the gummy tissue and tofu.  Not good.  3/10\n\nSo... most horrible experience possible leading up to actually tasting food...\n\nPlus, probably one of the worst meals of Chinese food I've had...\n\n(Oh, and unfortunately I don't have a picture, but the woman's bathroom is separated by a shower drapery in the dining room)... yeah, had to add that...\n\n1/5.

My brother opted for this restaurant because of the 4 star reviews. What a joke! It was embarrassing since we brought our cousins from Orange County. First of all, the dingy staircase was so narrow we had to either squeeze by a large group of exiting guests or stay at the bottom of the stairs until there was nobody coming down the stairs.\n\nThere is no space to wait except the  room where the mens bathroom was or on the stairs. After watching the servers clean the table, we got seated. The place was crowded, not only by guests but also by the number of tables crammed in the restaurant. You would expect with such a crowd there would be more servers but there were only 2 visible servers. It took over 20 minutes before we received any service. We asked for forks for the kids and water but got them quite late. The forks finally came after most of the dishes arrived but the water (2 cups only) came after asking a different server. Tea was empty for a while and we had to ask several times to get it refilled \n\nWhen we finally got the server to take our order, she read back what we asked for. Wonton soup, oxtail claypot, Hong Kong style beef noodles, honey walnut prawns, bbq pork chops, snow peas and garlic, and rice.\n4\nWe were shocked to see the soup come. It was a VERY small sized bowl! It seems about half of what other restaurants would serve. The server said we would have to order 3 orders to serve all 8 of us. This appears to be the standard for this restaurant. At least for us. When i first entered the restaurant the food appeared to be fairly large servings but unfortunately, that was not the case for us. \n\nThe honey walnut shrimps came next. There may have been only 15 pieces of shiny looking shrimps and about 10 pieces of glazed walnuts.  The walnut was fairly crunchy but the shrimp was not hot. It appears that it was sitting out for quite some time since the shrimp was too shiny (the sauce was separating) and did not taste fresh.\n\nThe dishes were coming out one by one, having at least 5 -10 minutes pass by between each one. An hour has passed and we still did not have any water, rice, and the noodle dish. After waving to our server again and finally getting her attention, she informed us they were still making the dish. We complained we had no rice but not to bother because all the dishes were pretty much gone (yes, very small portions which seems strange because other tables seemed to get larger portions than ours. Several minutes later, the noodles came out. Hong Kong style? Yes it looked dry and crispy on the edges and moist in the middle. Hmmmm. Didn't we order beef? Didn't she say beef? Excuse me but this is chicken. We would have kept the chicken but she quickly grabbed the plate. 10 minutes or so later, a very full plate came back filled with soggy noodles. We debated if everything was new or did they just remove the chicken and piled it high with beef (chicken pieces were found under all that) it was recycled from the chicken noodles they brought first.\n\nFor me, the best dish was the oxtail clay pot. Only missing was rice. But again, portions were small.\n\nFacilities review: single narrow bathroom. It was dirty and narrow. At least it had a second area :where the sink was. My brother in law had a difficult time changing his daughter's pullup!\n\nFor the amount of customers they had, they needed more staff and the servers need to be more attentive and accurate.

I worked in Chinatown for more than a year, but I had no idea this place existed, even though I've walked down this street a thousand or so times.\n\nThe reason:  There's very little signage, and you have to walk up a flight of sketch-ball stairs in order to get to the actual restaurant.\n\nAs we walked up, I heard a lot of Cantonese going back and forth, and when I finally surfaced at the top of the steps, holy moly, ALL THESE CHINESE PEOPLE ERRWHERE.  Very authentic, it's a good sign.  This is clearly a family-style restaurant, as most of the tables are round and meant for at least 6 people.\n\nThey have soups, noodle and rice dishes, veggies, seafood, meats (including frog), and dishes clearly catered towards tourists (Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, etc.).\n\nBoyfriend ordered the honey walnut shrimp (OMG BEST ONE I'VE EVER EATEN), and I opted for the oxtail clay pot so I could compare it with R&G Lounge's.  I might have to say that I enjoyed R&G's better, as that one came with large chunks of daikon and you really can't beat the delicious gravy they have, but this one is a close second.  I liked the braised tofu and the flavor, but it didn't taste as hearty and rich as the other one.\n\nOur total came out to $22 before tip.  They take credit cards!  The only negative was the service; they were severely understaffed for so many large parties, and we had to flag them down to get menus, get our order taken, and get our check.\n\nDefinitely will be returning to order the honey walnut prawns all for myself.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-05-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the honey walnut prawns, which I'd probably skip next time - they were tasty enough but they felt more like an appetizer than a main course (it is served without veggies).

I was in the mood for steamed greens, and a nice cooked fish or something very basic/fresh/authentic...instead I went with a standard American Chinese Cuisine dish.

Again, I should not have ordered this int he first place, not sure what I was thinking. \n\nOysters with Black Bean Sauce: This was the dish I was thinking would make it or break it.

[S2]The food was relatively grease free as advertised.\n\nPros:\n* [S3] The food was actually pretty good.   Chinatown is not known for good quality Chinese food, but my first experience there today suggests that I will be back.  My lunch was flavorful, had fresh ingredients, was not buried in some unknown bottled sauce, and had a low level of oil.  \n* [S4] The lunch special is a ridiculous bargain.  It's priced at $4.60 on the menu and your choices include many of the standard Chinese lunch special fare items, including noodle soup.  [S5] It lacked any noodle plates however.  After tax the bill comes to $5.05, and after tip, a whopping $6.00.  Seriously, where can you get a decent, substantial, hot meal for six bucks out the door anywhere near downtown?  What do you get for this price?  You get a very good helping of your entr\u00e9e of choice (I opted to avoid the low-dollar meats and picked the braised tofu with tender greens), along with a side of rice, some very flavorful tea, and a fresh, individually wrapped fortune cookie for dessert.  Quite the bargain, I must say.  \n* The upstairs location of the restaurant gets you above the fray of Grant St, and if you sit next to the window, it's quite pleasant (recognizing of course that you're eating at an inexpensive place in Chinatown).\n* The mixed clientele - at lunch it was roughly 75% Asians (locals I suspect) that knew what they were doing, 20% tourists that probably had ended up there the same way I had (yelp), and 5% business people.   An Asian local joined me at my table and we got to talking.  He showed me a different lunch special menu that had a few more items on it written only in Chinese.  The secret Chinese-only menu can be a true sign that the restaurant is worth visiting.  To me it's basically saying \"We're authentic, and we can survive without pandering to Western tastes\".   Anyway, he ordered a fish dish (listed below) that I'm going to try next time.\n\nCons: \n* Looks a little dirty / run down, which can call hygiene into question, but hey, my sensitive stomach is fine a few hours later.\n\nWhile my lunch was good, and worth every penny of six bucks, I spied a number of tasty looking items that I want to get when I go next - with a group to try more things of course:\n* All of the lunch special items written only in Chinese, including the fish with tofu skin and black mushrooms ordered by my table companion.  \n* The green bean and shrimp lunch special, which looked scrumptious.  \n* Snow pea sprouts and potato sprouts (these both looked delicious and were ordered by an obviously experienced Asian group at a nearby table).\n* Their famous honey walnut prawns.  \n\nI'm not a big meat eater, and I've had enough cheap Chinese experience to not be tempted to order the meat dishes (it's only $4.60, people!), but I will take the risk on seafood from Asia in small quantities.

All of the food was flavorful, but not over seasoned, not too greasy, and had generous portions. I ended up ordering the house special chow mein, honey walnut prawns, and mongolian beef.  The honey walnut prawns were my favorite. Generous portion of both walnut and prawns. Unlike other places, the sauce was not too thick or too sweet, but just perfect. Also, the chow mein had an ample supply of mixed meat and was not overly greasy. I hate how sometimes you order chow mein and it's like your slurping up oiled noodles... nasty. The mongolian beef was just OK, i've had better. All in all, it was good and I would definitely return. Service was kind of slow once seated, and despite it being a small room two of the workers decided they wanted to talk to each other.... ACROSS THE ROOM. So here I have one lady screaming right next to my table and then from the other end having another guy screaming back at her.

One hour.\n\nThen we sat down.  They took our order.  ONE ANNNNDDDD A HALF!!!!!! hours later we get our first dish.  Let me repeat: 1.5hrs between taking our order and serving our first dish.  And yes, we asked what was going on.  There was a guy that came by, and after we inquired, he would say multiple times, \"I don't work here but I am helping out.  I am a customer.\"  ...Yeah, um, right... that's what I thought too.  Look, I'm Chinese.  I've eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants.  Usually the food comes faster than at your typical American places.  So, 1.5hr to cook is something special.  Something very special indeed.\n\nSo fine, the food:\n\n1. Steamed Black Bass Fish $15.95: Holy crap!  The fish was quite small and falling apart when it arrived.  Just look at my pictures.  It's a mess.  Tasted normal, but not any better than I can cook at home just steaming a fish from Ranch 99 with some soy sauce and sesame oil on top.  $16!  Gawd.  2/10\n\n2. Chicken Fried Rice $7.95:  (No I didn't order this... see person with far lighter skin to my left.)  So, it's fried rice with pieces of chicken.  I guess it was alright.  Not much to say.  5/10.\n\n3. Honey Walnut Prawns $8.50: Well, I've had this dish many dozens of times.  This one was the worst of the bottom 1/3rd or so.  The batter was not crispy... a tad soggy.  Walnuts and mayo sauce were fine.  The shrimp itself wasn't overcooked.  But well, being soggy kinda kills it.  4/10\n\n4. Snow Pea Sprouts w/ Garlic $8.50: Ahhhhh.... such a needed break--this one was excellent.  Nothing over-the-top.  Just well cooked and seasoned, in a simply traditional fashion.  Vegetables tasted fresh.  7/10\n\n5. Beef Stew in Clay Pot $8.50:  Too much tofu.  And too much of the chewy tissue Chinese use from stewing meat.  You can see that stuff rolled up in cylinders in the pictures.  It was also not cooked long enough so I think most people either threw it away or spit it out.  The beef itself was alright, but there was far less of that than the gummy tissue and tofu.  Not good.  3/10\n\nSo... most horrible experience possible leading up to actually tasting food...\n\nPlus, probably one of the worst meals of Chinese food I've had...\n\n(Oh, and unfortunately I don't have a picture, but the woman's bathroom is separated by a shower drapery in the dining room)... yeah, had to add that...\n\n1/5.

This is because we did not want other people at work finding out about it and then when we show up there for a nice lunch to see a table full of jerks from work there.  This place has spiritual significance to me because it was the first time I tasted Caola Ila Scotch.  It was where I met Lilly my favorite Chinatown waitress - who use to work at the Utopia - who introduced me to snow pea leaves as a vegetable dish to be enjoyed.  So, now that I am retired, I can sing loud and long about this very special restaurant.\n\nSo what's so good about \"the upper room\"?  The staff, the location, the ambiance and the food.  But before I share this information with you, you must promise to observe the rules that will preserve this treasure for posterity.\n\n1.  Don't tell any of your jerk friends where this place is.  Use the code name.\n2.  Ask for Lilly to be your waitress and tip her generously.  (If its close to Chinese New Year, bring her a red packet with nothing less than $20)\n3. Don't ask for soy sauce and for god's sake don't put it on your rice!!\n4.  When you order food, don't ask \"What's in it?\"  It makes you look like a klutz.\n5.  Treat all the restaurant workers as you would your priest - they work very hard and are very good people.\n6. If you don't like the food - it is probably because you are unaccustomed to the taste.  This is real Chinese food for Chinese, it isn't Chinese food for Americans.\n\nOk, if you agree to the above - then you have my permission to read more\n\nThe Staff:  They appreciate your business!  They work very hard to serve the very best food in a timely manner.  There are elderly Chinese cleaning vegetables, washing dishes and preparing food for cooking.   Lilly is a stone faced woman who moves with quick efficiency and suffers through a multitude of questions by Gweilo (that's you if you are not Chinese - Google it ).  I like Lilly because she is smart but unassuming.  I've seen people ask such rude and stupid questions about the food that I am ashamed to be there to hear it and think, \"My god!  Those people are so insulting to Lilly!\" - but she stands straight with an expressionless face to listen to these people who have no idea how condescending or insulting they are - takes their orders and provides excellent service.  For me, when the restaurant is out of something I want - like oysters, frogs, clams or snow pea leaves, she tells me what I should have.  Well, she suggests - but there is that ever so slight inflection in her voice that lets me know: \"Steve, the only option here is xxx\".  She is always right.  After going there for years - she knows what we like and she knows what is available... and when she sees the bottle of whiskey that we bring, she automatically brings out the glasses.  Why the big tips?  Restitution for the sins of the ignorant brethren and for services rendered.  Also, when you go, ask \"How is your son doing in school Lilly?\"  Then you will see her beam!\n\nThe location:  It's hard to find.  Yep!  That is good.  It means that only people who know where it is will be there.  Yes, there are occasional groups of tourists who come in and order fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and chow mein - but that's probably only for the amusement of the staff.  \n\nThe ambiance:  God I love it there!  There is usually a party of Chinese men getting ripped on Hennesy - dressed in their work clothes that show they are tradesmen - eating the best food talking loudly and laughing as if no one were there.  Sometimes they eye what I'm drinking and nod approvingly  It is a fine place to be \"a regular\".  I'm not talking \"Yelp check-in regular\" but \"where the staff knows you and respects you\" regular.  The windows are open usually and you can hear the street noise - the tables are crammed in to seat as many as possible and there is a display case on the wall with containers of the drinks available: coke, 7-up, Bud, Sing Tao and other items which include a bottle of cleaning fluid.
