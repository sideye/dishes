If I'm going to pay 2x the price for a chicken gyro wrap, the chicken better be free-range and Mary, herself better be tending to them--am I right?\n\nLet's start with the good. I like that Souvla's menu is very simple. Choose a protein (pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie), then decide whether you want a wrap ($10-$13) or a salad ($11-$14). Make it a combo meal with sides ($4-$6): fries, potatoes, side salad, or soup. Have a sweet tooth? End your meal with Greek froyo ($4-$5).

Expensive for a casual, \"fast food\" lunch with no waiter service. At these prices, I expected the food to be Greekgasmic.\n\nI appreciate Souvla's use of fresh, high-quality ingredients. Given how simple the menu is, it's unfortunate the food was less than mediocre. \n\nMy Superior Farms Leg Lamb Wrap ($13): https://bitly.com/a/bitlinks was superiorly dry and bland. I enjoyed the warm, thick, and fluffy pita bread but it was filled with flavorless, tough, and chewy cubes of lamb (texture of well done top round). The lamb was devoid of any spices. The yogurt sauce was concentrated at the opening end of the pita so I kept reaching for the bottle of hot sauce on our table to add flavor and moisture to the rest of the wrap. I ended up using half the bottle. \n\nMy co-worker said the chicken in the Mary's Organic Chicken Salad ($14) was dry and bland as well. This seems to be the common complaint among other yelpers with their proteins.\n\nI couldn't help but think one could buy nearly 3 whole rotisserie chicken from Costco for $14. Yikes, I sound like a cheap phuck but at least Costco's rotisserie chicken is well-seasoned and moist. \n\nThe saving grace were the side of Greek Fries ($4). They were piping hot, deliciously crunchy, and fluffy on the inside. The fries are supposed to be topped with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, mizithra cheese but we barely got a smidge of each. You have to pay an extra $1 for a tiny container of dipping sauce--what the heezy?!? If you're going to nickel and dime customers, just charge $5 and include the sauce. It's an inconvenience to later find out that ketchup is not available and have to stand in line again (and that line can get long) just to buy the dipping sauce.\n\nI doubt I would return to Souvla, nor would I recommend it to anyone looking for a legit Greek meal.

Chicken salad and Veg wrap. \n\n(A) The Chicken Salad: Rarely do I eat salads, but love that this salad does not seem to be a salad, rather a more complex meal. It is not overly drenched in sauce, but a flavor burst of thoughtful ingredients - the herby fennel, with the citrus bust from naval orange, and the tartness of the pickled red onion, which complements the creamy feta cheese - all carefully tossed in \"granch\" dressing. \n\n(B) The Vegetable Wrap: I love the warm pita bread hugging the roasted white sweet potato like a comforting blanket around a most delicate angel skinned white potato baby, drizzled with garlic yogurt, sprinkled with the savory kalamanta olive, with the nutty aroma and crunch from the roasted walnut, on top which the pickled red onion, crisp pea shoots and mizithra cheese sit so delicately. \n\n(C) Juicy Potatoes and Greek Fries: I love the potato sides at Souvla, whether roasted or fried. It always compliments the main dish so well - and is fun to share. The juicy potatoes are so moist and tender - picking up the beautiful juices of the rotisserie drippings and oregano. The Greek fries are cooked to a perfect crisp, with every bite flavored with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley and mizithra cheese. Yum. \n\n(2) But my absolute favorite part? The creamy, rich Greek yogurt soft serve. \n\nI absolutely love the glorious Baklava Crumbles and honey syrup Greek yogurt. It is essentially a deconstructed warm, just out-of-the over baklava sitting on top creamy Greek soft serve yogurt that is rich and buttery to a fault. All drizzled in honey syrup to add that sticky honeyed element.

I wasn't sure about a potato sandwich at first, but after one bite, I was sold. I enjoyed the chicken as a salad, but the kale could've used some more massaging or something because it was pretty tough. The lamb sandwich is delicious and dripping with juices. I would recommend that if you're looking for something a little more traditional. The juicy potatoes were indeed juicy, but also incredibly oily. The greek fries are great for sharing and large cut.

Overall, I saw only empty plates going back to the kitchen - and that is always a good sign!\n\nIn comparison to other brunch places in California, the portions served here are relatively small so you can easily pick two dishes if you are very hungry or share three between two people. Prices rank between $9 and $13 and these are totally reasonable.\n\nAlso great about this place is that we only waited for 5 minutes to order and be seated at Souvla on a Saturday morning at 11am, which is really unique in San Francisco.
