Gotta be a real tourist trap, yeah?\n\nHoly crap, was I surprised.\n\nOn his recommendation, a coworker and myself wandered in just before the dinner rush, and promptly grabbed two seats at the long wooden bar. I ordered up a mineral water and a Manhattan, both of which were delivered promptly. The drink was an exercise in perfection - I'm a fan of the classic cocktails, and Tadich Grill just bloody nailed it.  My Manhattan was a pitch-perfect proportion of whiskey, bitters, and vermouth served chilled, but not ice cold.  A better cocktail I've not had in quite a while.  As a bonus, it was barely over $7, which is a relative bargain for a mixed drink in this city.\n\nI had a simple green salad tossed with oil and vinegar and a spot of ground black pepper to accompany my entree.  It was all it needed to be - basic, fresh, light, and green. For an entree, I ordered a whole grilled Mediterranean sea bass, which turned up cooked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside, light, tender and flaky on the inside.  I could have eaten two had I wanted to be a glutton.  Dressed with a little olive oil and lemon, this was an outstanding fish. The quarter-round of crusty sourdough bread Tadich provides was put to good use mopping up the plate afterward.  Bless them for serving Brussels sprouts as a side veg, too.  I love the things, though most people unfairly seem to dislike them with a passion.\n\nMy desert was a real classic - almost a relic, really - bourbon bread pudding, which was chock full of nuts, berries, raisins, and apples covered in a surprisingly not-cloying bourbon caramel sauce.  I had to stop halfway on this, and I'm not a guy who blithely discards desert.  It's really rich stuff, but it went a treat with a cup of coffee to end the meal.\n\nFor those that are used to the new school of restaurant service that includes an overly chipper server chirping the specials of the day at you after introducing themselves and kneeling down at table level to talk, I'm sure that the Tadich staff might seem a little stern.  They're not, though.  They're efficient, professional, and no-nonsense, and they're really good at keeping things moving in a busy place while not making you feel rushed.  And you know, I prefer it that way.\n\nSo, if you're visiting San Francisco, just go here.  It's one of those rare places that actually lives up to its reputation.

We came back again today for lunch and each ordered something we've never had at Tadich - he the ciappino and me the Dungeness crab salad with 1/2 avacado. Hands down the best ciopinno and best crab salad ever! \n\nWe watched the waiters slice freshly breaked thick loaves of sourdough bread. We appreciated the Christmas decorations. We had a cocktail (or two) and fully realized that Tadich Grill is our very own San Francisco original European Bistro. The oldest restaurant west of the Mississippi is so much more than just the amazingly fresh and delicious food. It's he atmosphere and the people watching and the professional waiters (and one waitress) who could seamlessly refill our water glasses and replace small slices of fresh butter and carve through that delicious sourdough roll in their sleep. \nI noticed a gorgeous slice of cheesecake being prepared for a table and pointed it out to my hubs. When it came time to order dessert, we ordered a slice with raspberry sauce and two Irish coffees. It was the best cheesecake we have ever had. I cannot believe we missed this before. \nThe experience was phenomenal and while there usually is a wait for bar seats, they're worth it. \nI count dining at Tadich Grill as one of the worlds great restaurant experiences (spoiler alert, Forbes does, too). The food is fresh and fabulous and the experience is worth savoring. Put down your phones and spend the time looking around, you may just find your next favorite Tadich dish. My neighbor ordered prime rib and french fries and I was having a serious case of order envy.

I found when the waiter gave us a bottle of tabasco sauce when the clams arrived, he most likely intended for us to have it with the clams because after adding a few drops to each clam, it masked any clammy taste and gave it a smooth taste along with the garlic.  Went really well with the clams.  \n\nSauteed Scallops:  Large portions of scallops with a side of broccoli and pilaf.   I was pretty much done for before I had the scallops after all the clams, I think we went too far with the seafood.  I had one scallop which was massive in size.  It was bland and did not have much flavor other than the fishy scallop taste which I believe it was undercooked.  \n\nMinute Steak : 9 oz new york steak - Simply cooked steak.  Nothing fancy, just a grilled steak with no flavorings.  Add some A1 sauce, Lee and Perrins and you're good to go.  \n\nI'll give it 3 stars because they are keeping it simple and close to I guess how it has always been without changing its menu.

We were all  shopping, walking all over creation etc... And was starvin' Marvin. My Uncle recommended we all eat at Tadich Grill. Why not? I've never eaten hear before. \n\n They list there menu outside of the restaurant for those who want to what is offered before entering. The menu is never the same and changes everyday based on what fresh meat and seafood is available for that day. \n\n We walk in and the bar area is huge! This is one of not the oldest restaurant in San Francisco. It's been in busy since 1849 and the family still owns the restaurant! \n\n To dine in you must spend at $11.50 per per which is easy to do. Check splitting is $9.00 per person for those who like to split checks and No substitutions on food. \n\n I ordered the Traditional Tadich meatloaf $18.95 I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but the meatloaf here is on point! One of the best I've ever had. It's 3 thick slices wrapped in bacon and topped with a delicious mushroom sauce. It comes with mash potatoes and mixed vegetables. The mixed veggies were tasty and can't comment on the potatoes as I'm allergic. \n\n My honey ordered the hamburger steak dinner $22.95, which came with insanely thick & huge cut potato wedges and mixed vegetables. She said the hamburger steak is amazing. Both of us had very generous dinner portions. \n\n My sister ordered the scallop dinner which came with 4 seared scallops, rice pilaf and mixed vegetables. The portion was decent, but not for the price $33 which could have been a more generous portion( ie 2 extra Scallops would be nice) My sister enjoyed the sauce on Scallops, however the Scallops were a little on the chewy side and had a noticeable fishy aftertaste. She said she would order this dish again if, the Scallops are more on the fresher side. \n\n My brother in law ordered the Seafood curry $30. This dish was recommended by our waiter. My brother in law was going to order the same thing, I did, but didn't since the waiter highly recommend this dish, he went for it. When my bro in law's food came out it didn't look appealing at all! It looked like, what I would call a bowl o vomit... you heard right! My bro took a bit and immediately said ,the seafood curry is terrible! The look on his face was priceless! My sister & I were thinking it couldn't be that bad and though he was being a bit dramatic. So, I offered to try it and trade dishes, if need be. Nope! Bro in law wasn't being dramatic, the dish is real bad! I took a bit and started looking for somewhere to spit that mess out. Problem number #1 whoever made this dish obviously didn't taste the dish, otherwise he/she would have known that the curry powder wasn't mixed at the  way, who wants grainy, chalky thick ass curry powder in there food? #2 seasoning goes at long way had the dish been tasted before serving.  #3 The seafood had an off taste seriously, I really want to know who made this dish they were out of pocket and should rethink this dish before ever putting it on the menu again. #4 when waiter comes back to ask everyone how there food is? My bro in law tells the waiter the seafood curry isn't good and would like to order something else. When, I tell you the waiter looked insulted he gave some serious side under his glasses i was almost laughable. The waiter then says, you don't like it? Bro say, No! Waiter says, you want something else? Bro says, Yes! Waiter says, okay. You'll still have to pay for the seafood curry! We all looked at each other like, WTF?! Dude have you tasted that crap?! That dish had a bite and a half out the dish. It's not edible! I posted a photo of this Terrible seafood dish! I'm glad it wasn't me would ordered that dish, I would have told the waiter, I'm not paying for nothing I can't eat. Bro is out an unnecessary $30 and the waiter had the never to put the food in a doggy bag, like you taking this food with you. Lol! Be careful what you order if it ain't cooked right not edible etc... you're stuck with it! My bro in law did order end up ordering the meatloaf.\n\nMy Uncle ordered the Sand Dabs which came with mixed vegetables He said it was really fresh and tasty. I unfortunately, didn't get a photo if his dish. However, It did look really good. \n\n Tadich Grill for the most part is pretty decent as long as you don't order the wrong stuff. I would definitely stick to the basics when ordering, especially since they will make you pay even if, you don't eat something that doesn't taste right! \n\nMy overall rating is 3.5 stars based on the entire dinning experience and for the waiter who helped us wasn't very friendly eithe. I don't think making a customer pay for food that isn't edible is right, first and foremost and I recommend not ordering anything that the waiter recommends for this reason.

Now there is a name I have not heard and been to in ages. I was treated to lunch here many times when I was working in SF by a manager and a colleague.  We had some family members come visit from overseas, and The Mother chose Tadich Grill for the family to congregate for lunch the day before Turkey Day. \n\nTadich Grill does not take reservations.  Tadich Grill will seat their guests once the entire party is present, there is no seating of partial parties. Our guests of honor were already at Tadich Grill when The Mother and I arrived. I opted to wait for The Sibling and The Sibling-in-Law outside as the guests and The Mother were getting anxious for them to come as they were getting hungry. We were delighted when The Sibs showed up. And we were seated in one of the booths in the back of Tadich Grill. I was aware of the booths, never ate in one. The times I used to come, we would eat at the bar or at a table. \n\nSo let's see, what did we order. We had various types of clam chowder (Boston or Coney Island) for a starter and one of us had a grand salad of lettuce and avocado with dressing on the side. The Mother and one of the relatives had petrale sole filet for their main dish. The other had a surf and turf special --a lobster tail with a skirt steak. The SIL had a lamb shank. I cannot remember what The Sibling chose.\n\nAs for me, I went with the bone-in rib eye steak served with steak frites with carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. It is go big or go home when it comes to Tadich Grill for me. And I was able to get it cooked rare. It was so good, I attacked and savored every bite of the steak like the combination of the bear and tiger I am. Damn good rib eye steak I have had in a long, long time! I wish you all could have seen The Mother roll her eyes when I announced I was having the bone-in rib eye steak. It was quite funny--priceless!\n\nWe were attended to by a grandfatherly looking server whose personality has the wicked sense of humour of one's favorite uncle. The uncle you know who has all the wicked jokes and stories up his sleeve and in his repetoire. He wore the classic white shirt and jacket off-set with a black tie, black trousers, and black shoes accompanying by the classic old school service of being professional and attentive to the clientele. He kept my water glass filled and jokingly blamed my consuming water as the reason why there is a drought. My SIL ordered a bottle of white wine and the server let them perform the duties of a sommeliere and they declared it was good. We all had some to share. \n\nHowever, we were all too stuffed to have dessert except The SIL. They ordered a baked apple with caramel sauce on the side and offered samples to us. I politely passed yet I got to sample the caramel sauce.\n\nTadich Grill has been around the days of the Gold Rush days. They have the kind of classic, elegant service that is rare these days and back in the day, my parents' generation really appreciated. And I get it. I appreciated it even more when The Mother inadvertently left behind her cap and gloves. Fortunately, they turned up and I was able to retrieve them on Black Friday.

However, I am not sure I will come back as tonight was the polar opposite from last.\n\nMy friends from New York City flew in for my birthday and took me here because they knew how much I had liked it.\n\nSo the review:\n\nNo wait, walked right in, sat at a 4 top.  Awesome, too good to be true.\nAbout 12 minutes had gone by before we were even greeted by a waiter.\nBread was dropped off in a rush with no words.\nAnother 5-6 minutes went by, he came for our drink order and rushed off.\nAnother 10 minutes went by, our drinks came but our order was not taken.\nFinally, after how many more minutes, he came by to take our order.\nThe food came out quickly.  I ordered a dinner salad and my friend ordered a bowl of chowder, pre main course.\n\nHalfway through my dinner salad, my boyfriend noticed something moving on a piece of bay shrimp.  It was a very alive and green caterpillar -  or fat worm.  I wasn't grossed out, in fact, I was glad it was still moving as I looked at it to be fresh greens, but my party was not amused.  After flagging down three employees, we were ignored, given the \"wait a minute\" finger and overlooked.  Finally, when our waiter came by with our entrees, we let him know and he took the plate, asked if I wanted another which I declined.\n\nFinally, the main course.\n\nMy Chilean Sea Bass was good, not as good as before.  Seemed like it sat for awhile and had time to cool off.\nMy boyfriend's ravioli was ok, he said it wasn't as good as he's had there before either.\nMy friend's pasta with clams was over cooked, mushy and clams were on the fishy side...very disappointing...and her husband's Rainbow Trout was probably the only satisfactory dish.\n\nThe clam pasta was not touched, my boyfriend shared his ravioli with my friend and both fish dishes were finished.  \n\nAfter one last table check, we declined coffee/dessert as we just wanted to go home at this point.  Our check came and the worm salad was still on as well as a drink that we hadn't ordered.  When told that it wasn't ours, the waiter said that it was from our bar tab - which we had never been to, nor did we order a drink.  \n\nI can understand when it's been a long shift and you're tired, but one of the most redeeming qualities in people is when they're forthcoming and humble.  I think it's safe to say that most human beings would be reasonable and forgiving of mistakes - but the grumpiness, lack of service and unfriendliness was unnecessary.\n\nI hate writing reviews like this because I'd rather leave a good one, but I was extremely disappointed and am hoping it was just an off night as I really do like this place...hence the extra star.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-04-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the fried rainbow trout with steamed broccoli and fries, which was ok."], "author": "Michael K.", "review": "Dear Tadich,\n\nI now look for live worms in all of my salads, because that is the bar you've set for \"fresh food!\" \n\nIn all seriousness maybe it was just an unlucky day where we had bad food and bad service.

You walk in to finely dressed waiters and tables, lined along cafe curtain dressed windows. There is alot of dark wood, giving it a Tavern feel. \n\nWhen I walked in and immediately smelled char broiled steaks, I had no choice than to have the Filet Mignon. I am so smart and it was the perfect choice. The filet could be cut with a butter knife and the juicy goodness just melted on my tongue. My tongue was dancing with joy. Hubby had the NY Strip and he enjoyed every last bite. \n\nI started with the Oysters Rockefeller which were very good. Hubby had the NE Clam Chowder and my mother had the Asparagus Leek soup. For her entree she had the pan seared Rainbow Trout. \n\nEverything is Ala Carte, so plan on dropping some cash here. It is very expensive. \n\nService is top notch, by very seasoned waiters and the food selection leaves nothing to be desired. When in San Fran again, I shall try the Lobster & Crab Thermidor and ask my hubby to order the Filet, so I can still have that bite of char broiled heaven! \n\nThe desserts sounded amazing and next time I may skip the appetizer so I have room to try a dessert.\n\nJust to let you know, if you would like to check out the Tadich Grill and you are not into splurging, they do have a large selection of salads.

I am a big, voracious eater and don't balk at mediocre food usually, but at Tadich's I left 3/4 of a horrible tasting bass steak on my plate.  i was really shocked that a $24 plate could be so unacceptable.   at first I thought it must be me.   then I tasted my wife's bland, horribly sauced petrale sole, and saw she refused to eat even half.  then everyone else in our party of 6 reported their supposedly \"fresh\" fish and shellfish tasted BAD also, dry, old, probably frozen a long time.  halibut florentine had dry overcooked fish, completely overwhelmed by cheesy sauce.  split pea soup was too rich, over-seasoned, thick and pasty,   no selection of wine by the glass (2 choices for chardonnay) and neither were even passably good.    the menu for my house special bass plate said \"potatoes\" which I selected in part because many other menu items came with steak fries, which I didn't want.    the plate came with fries, and the waiter acted shocked when I asked for some potatoes, as listed on the menu.  (he did bring them though).   only the french bread and butter is good, plus ample quantify of decent steamed vegetables.   Don't eat at Tadich.

Now there is a name I have not heard and been to in ages. I was treated to lunch here many times when I was working in SF by a manager and a colleague.  We had some family members come visit from overseas, and The Mother chose Tadich Grill for the family to congregate for lunch the day before Turkey Day. \n\nTadich Grill does not take reservations.  Tadich Grill will seat their guests once the entire party is present, there is no seating of partial parties. Our guests of honor were already at Tadich Grill when The Mother and I arrived. I opted to wait for The Sibling and The Sibling-in-Law outside as the guests and The Mother were getting anxious for them to come as they were getting hungry. We were delighted when The Sibs showed up. And we were seated in one of the booths in the back of Tadich Grill. I was aware of the booths, never ate in one. The times I used to come, we would eat at the bar or at a table. \n\nSo let's see, what did we order. We had various types of clam chowder (Boston or Coney Island) for a starter and one of us had a grand salad of lettuce and avocado with dressing on the side. The Mother and one of the relatives had petrale sole filet for their main dish. The other had a surf and turf special --a lobster tail with a skirt steak. The SIL had a lamb shank. I cannot remember what The Sibling chose.\n\nAs for me, I went with the bone-in rib eye steak served with steak frites with carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. It is go big or go home when it comes to Tadich Grill for me. And I was able to get it cooked rare. It was so good, I attacked and savored every bite of the steak like the combination of the bear and tiger I am. Damn good rib eye steak I have had in a long, long time! I wish you all could have seen The Mother roll her eyes when I announced I was having the bone-in rib eye steak. It was quite funny--priceless!\n\nWe were attended to by a grandfatherly looking server whose personality has the wicked sense of humour of one's favorite uncle. The uncle you know who has all the wicked jokes and stories up his sleeve and in his repetoire. He wore the classic white shirt and jacket off-set with a black tie, black trousers, and black shoes accompanying by the classic old school service of being professional and attentive to the clientele. He kept my water glass filled and jokingly blamed my consuming water as the reason why there is a drought. My SIL ordered a bottle of white wine and the server let them perform the duties of a sommeliere and they declared it was good. We all had some to share. \n\nHowever, we were all too stuffed to have dessert except The SIL. They ordered a baked apple with caramel sauce on the side and offered samples to us. I politely passed yet I got to sample the caramel sauce.\n\nTadich Grill has been around the days of the Gold Rush days. They have the kind of classic, elegant service that is rare these days and back in the day, my parents' generation really appreciated. And I get it. I appreciated it even more when The Mother inadvertently left behind her cap and gloves. Fortunately, they turned up and I was able to retrieve them on Black Friday.

They must have been pretty damn good to stand the test of that time.  My first time there was when my dear departed mom took me to SF for a 16th birthday weekend celebration.  I won't say how long ago that was, but it was not long enough ago that I didn't remember it.  Don't remember having been back since...\n\nFast forward to Monday.  I met my sister and friend there for lunch.  We got there right at 11:30, to avoid the rush and lucked out and got seated in a booth.  After all agreeing to have a martini, even though it was way too early for cocktail hour, we set about making our selections.  \n\nI have always wanted to try hangtown fry, so went for that.  S got the calves liver and K got the petrale sole.  These selections were so 1930!  I was a little disappointed with mine.  It was cooked too long.  The eggs were way well done, and the oysters were beyond the point where they retained any of their luscious liquors.  Also it definitely could have used more salt!  \n\nS.'s liver was perfectly medium (just pink) with lots of sauteed onions.  There aren't a lot of places where you can order liver at all, let alone perfectly cooked.  K's petrale sole was also expertly sauteed.  It was a large portion and very fresh.\n\nOur waiter was efficient to a fault, but pretty cold in demeanor.  I definitely got the message that he wanted to take care of business and turn the table.  Unfortunately for him, we weren't that kind of gals.  We lingered and talked, and though he didn't shoot us dirty looks, I'm sure he would have preferred if we'd left faster.\n\nThere were so many other classic retro dishes I'd like to try.

We arrived around 11:30-11:45 AM..to celebrate my sister's birthday. \n\nWe had just finished a wonderful morning in Japantown at Kabuki Spa and Springs.  We were all in a wonderful and giddy mood.  All starving , but definitely in great spirits and ready to eat some exciting food..! However the experience we received was quite the opposite. \n\nWe had 5 ladies in our group and were extremely excited to eat at Tadich Grill, given all the great reviews that Tadich Grill has on YELP.  More so,  my cousins boss recommended this restaurant because he said the food was delicious and the service was outstanding..  Well, I beg to differ after my experience.\n\nOur waiter was Barry,  He came off as rude and arrogant and completely acted like he was too good to be waiting on us.  We decided not to make a big deal because we wanted to have a really good experience at Tadich.  So we brushed off Barry's attitude and continued....\n\nWe started off by ordering calamari and oysters on the half shell, some soup and a few soft drinks.\n\nThe appetizers came out very quickly and we were greatly appreciative considering we were starving! The calamari was great and so were the oysters.  Calamari came out hot and the oysters were fresh..!\n\nBarry brought out my coke... with a lot of ice and in a very small glass. I thought it was kind of weird for soda to come out in such small glass, but no big deal. \n\nBarry came back after a few minutes and we ordered the lobster thermadore, ciopinno, shrimp curry and 2 orders of the petrale sole.\n\nThe ciopinno was one of the best I've ever had.  The rest of the of the food was mediocre.  Pretty blahhhhhh.. Not a lot of flavor or taste.  Needed a lot more spice and salt.  Not worth the money we spent that day. \n\nI think what killed it for me was being told to pay for a 'REFILL' on a coke.  C'mon, are you kidding me!!!! We are paying well over $25-35 per entree...and Tadich Grill charges for refills on soda..and to top it off, the soda comes out in such tiny glasses..with an abundance of ice....!!!! Absolutely preposterous!!!! I was so turned off by this...  I could not believe it.  But even more so, to add insult to injury... When I asked Barry for a refill, he very rudely says, \"I can't REFILL it for you, but you can RE-PURCHASE another one. Of course, I RE-purchased another coke.\n\nNow Barry brings out the bill..total $207...and some change. We place a $50 bill, plus 3 credit cards and tell Barry to put $50 cash towards the bill and split the remaining balance between the credit cards.\n\nMy aunt then wants to pay $100 with her card and advised Barry to put $100 on her card, put $50 towards the remaining balance and then finally split that balance between the 2 cards.\n\nBarry pockets $50 because he says that it was understood that it was going to be his tip...!!! Barry...ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!! What in the world would make you think that you deserve a 30% tip.....!!!!!!! He didn't even deserve a 18% tip...Even though we still ended up giving him a tip..!\n\nWhen Barry came back with the screw up..we told him that he messed up and we needed it corrected.  Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue. He mumbled an array of rude remarks under his breath an came back and pretty much threw the bill at us. I've never been so appalled in my life.  And to top it off... he never once made a reference to my sisters birthday.. !!!\n\nOn another note: We tried to stop another waiter to ask for some water refills.  The waiter simply replied that he would find Barry, but he was doing absolutely nothing..just standing there. He could have easily refilled our water glasses.  Extremely rude and lazy.\n\nI'm not only disappointed in the food, but I'm disgusted with the service.", "rating": 1, "date": "2014-01-14"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the jumbo prawn appetizer, a bowl of Boston clam chowder and the pan fried petrale sole.

If you arrive after 9pm, you can usually get a table relatively quickly. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was Jannis.\n\nWe were provided the usual menus, and received burned frenchbread from the busboy. The waiter asked us if we wanted to order a drink. We told him no thank you, he seemed disappointed. We asked for water with no ice. When the busboy brought us our water, with ice, we noticed the menu had a new disclaimer.\n\nThe restaurant is not responsible for seafood tainted with mercury, or other containinants. Well I hope Tadich checks their fish purveyors! Maybe I shouldn't eat seafood from Tadich's? Mmmmm...I am paying for cancer?\n\nWe signaled the waiter we were ready to order. The waiter asked us if we cared for appetizers or salads. We said no thank you. He looked very disappointed again. We ordered petrale sole and the mixed grille.  \n\nWe were ignored with burned bread and no water until the food came. When the food arrived, the portions were small and there were 3 french fries on each plate. We said nothing, ate our food and signaled the waiter for our check. When the waiter came to the table, he asked us if we cared for dessert or coffee. We said no thank you. He seemed again disappointed.\n\nWe came to Tadich for a quick good meal. We left there hungry, and annoyed at the waiter who kept trying to sell us items we did not want. We realize the waiters make over $100,000.00 or more at Tadich, but they should not be trying to up their check averages as to get higher tips.\n\nI am a native San Franciscan. I have gone to Tadich sporadically all my life. The quality has slipped substantially. The restaurant is not focused on quality or value, but on check averages and volume.\n\nThe waiters are pompous and need a lesson in humility. They need to  understand that the customer is the focus, not their wallet. When someone orders water with no ice, do not bring a glass full of ice because you feel jilted because the customer did not order a $10.00 cocktail.\n\nI like professional waiters who are usually caring, and real professionals. I tip them accordingly. However I felt Jannis my waiter was not deserving of a tip. I left a 15% tip anyway.\n\nI will not be going back to Tadich. This is my goodbye. This restaurant has lost its' lustre, value, and charm. The waiters have ruined the place with their greed.

I remember when this neighborhood was only populated by women in dresses and men in suits and ties, often carrying brief cases (hard and likely leather).\n\nNow, it's a different world with people younger than me... wait, I am getting up there now... in this part of town.  The waiters/waitresses in their traditional white jackets bring back memories of days gone by.  There were two counter seats open on the right so we saddled up and studied the menu.  I was tempted to try their touted cioppino, but, being lunch on a work day, didn't want to doze off in a food coma at my desk.  Their sand dabs are another signature, but I'm not that big on fish.  As a result, here's what I had:\n\n1. Coney Island clam chowder (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UeWAA_lf-Q1sjS2WR57nvQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pretty good version and tomato-ey.

Linguine with clams, white wine sauce (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oJ8EPvYiGh6ZojpR0zeFmg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Very simple yet clean tasting preparation which led to plenty of bread dipping.  My friend pointed out that the clams were still in shell, unlike most places where they serve this with chopped clams (possibly canned).\n\nOur waiter was curt and efficient but not very amicable.  Water glasses and my iced tea were refilled as well as my host's coffee cup.  The vibe is a little different from what I remember with a mix of the local work force and tourists during this weekday lunch.  I enjoyed my meal and the sourdough bread went a long way in cleaning both food bowls.  \n\nGuess I need to try their Cioppino next time.

We were all  shopping, walking all over creation etc... And was starvin' Marvin. My Uncle recommended we all eat at Tadich Grill. Why not? I've never eaten hear before. \n\n They list there menu outside of the restaurant for those who want to what is offered before entering. The menu is never the same and changes everyday based on what fresh meat and seafood is available for that day. \n\n We walk in and the bar area is huge! This is one of not the oldest restaurant in San Francisco. It's been in busy since 1849 and the family still owns the restaurant! \n\n To dine in you must spend at $11.50 per per which is easy to do. Check splitting is $9.00 per person for those who like to split checks and No substitutions on food. \n\n I ordered the Traditional Tadich meatloaf $18.95 I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but the meatloaf here is on point! One of the best I've ever had. It's 3 thick slices wrapped in bacon and topped with a delicious mushroom sauce. It comes with mash potatoes and mixed vegetables. The mixed veggies were tasty and can't comment on the potatoes as I'm allergic. \n\n My honey ordered the hamburger steak dinner $22.95, which came with insanely thick & huge cut potato wedges and mixed vegetables. She said the hamburger steak is amazing. Both of us had very generous dinner portions. \n\n My sister ordered the scallop dinner which came with 4 seared scallops, rice pilaf and mixed vegetables. The portion was decent, but not for the price $33 which could have been a more generous portion( ie 2 extra Scallops would be nice) My sister enjoyed the sauce on Scallops, however the Scallops were a little on the chewy side and had a noticeable fishy aftertaste. She said she would order this dish again if, the Scallops are more on the fresher side. \n\n My brother in law ordered the Seafood curry $30. This dish was recommended by our waiter. My brother in law was going to order the same thing, I did, but didn't since the waiter highly recommend this dish, he went for it. When my bro in law's food came out it didn't look appealing at all! It looked like, what I would call a bowl o vomit... you heard right! My bro took a bit and immediately said ,the seafood curry is terrible! The look on his face was priceless! My sister & I were thinking it couldn't be that bad and though he was being a bit dramatic. So, I offered to try it and trade dishes, if need be. Nope! Bro in law wasn't being dramatic, the dish is real bad! I took a bit and started looking for somewhere to spit that mess out. Problem number #1 whoever made this dish obviously didn't taste the dish, otherwise he/she would have known that the curry powder wasn't mixed at the  way, who wants grainy, chalky thick ass curry powder in there food? #2 seasoning goes at long way had the dish been tasted before serving.  #3 The seafood had an off taste seriously, I really want to know who made this dish they were out of pocket and should rethink this dish before ever putting it on the menu again. #4 when waiter comes back to ask everyone how there food is? My bro in law tells the waiter the seafood curry isn't good and would like to order something else. When, I tell you the waiter looked insulted he gave some serious side under his glasses i was almost laughable. The waiter then says, you don't like it? Bro say, No! Waiter says, you want something else? Bro says, Yes! Waiter says, okay. You'll still have to pay for the seafood curry! We all looked at each other like, WTF?! Dude have you tasted that crap?! That dish had a bite and a half out the dish. It's not edible! I posted a photo of this Terrible seafood dish! I'm glad it wasn't me would ordered that dish, I would have told the waiter, I'm not paying for nothing I can't eat. Bro is out an unnecessary $30 and the waiter had the never to put the food in a doggy bag, like you taking this food with you. Lol! Be careful what you order if it ain't cooked right not edible etc... you're stuck with it! My bro in law did order end up ordering the meatloaf.\n\nMy Uncle ordered the Sand Dabs which came with mixed vegetables He said it was really fresh and tasty. I unfortunately, didn't get a photo if his dish. However, It did look really good. \n\n Tadich Grill for the most part is pretty decent as long as you don't order the wrong stuff. I would definitely stick to the basics when ordering, especially since they will make you pay even if, you don't eat something that doesn't taste right! \n\nMy overall rating is 3.5 stars based on the entire dinning experience and for the waiter who helped us wasn't very friendly eithe. I don't think making a customer pay for food that isn't edible is right, first and foremost and I recommend not ordering anything that the waiter recommends for this reason.

I guess I've never been all that motivated, especially since they don't accept reservations, and frankly none of my friends and colleagues ever mention it as a place they've ever wanted to try. I remember there were work lunches and dinners scheduled there over the years, but for one reason or another, I bagged it or suggested some other place that was higher on my wish list. But last week, I decided I should give it a try since it was in the middle of the afternoon well after the lunch rush. I was in meeting hell at work until about 2:30PM and decided I needed to get out of the building.\n\nI was sincerely thinking of getting a sandwich at Andersen Bakery across California when it struck me that Tadich would likely be empty at that hour. I was right. Except for a couple of lady barflies near the entrance, there was nary a diner at what turned out to be the full dining counter that dominates the long space. You could almost smell the long history in the place filled as it is with rich dark woods, faded mustard walls, and a brass railing that separates the bar from the dining counter (photo: http://bit.ly/1emSaVF). There were quite a few waiters flitting about all looking like old-school veterans uniformed in ties and white linen jackets. The highly traditional menu is dominated by seafood, but you can get meats prepared on their charcoal broiler if you are feeling more carnivorous.\n\nI heard their $31.25 Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread is their house specialty as well as their $23.95 Pan-Fried Sand Dabs with Steak Fries. Neither appealed to me at that hour since they struck me as filling and probably a bit messy. I was drawn to the $30.95 Poached Wild King Salmon Filet with Chopped Egg Sauce because it sounded like it could be a comparatively healthier dish (photo: http://bit.ly/16WzPvz). Not really. The thick egg sauce was ladled quite liberally on the salmon which I have to admit was a hearty portion and quite fresh-tasting. It came with boiled potatoes and a bevy of steamed vegetables - broccoli and cauliflower florets, baby carrots and diced tomatoes. It was nothing too excited but certainly good enough for an undiscriminating palate.\n\nUnderstand this was on top of a large hunk of sourdough bread and a constant replenishment of frozen butter pats (photo: http://bit.ly/16o29XN). However, this didn't deter me from ordering the $6.95 dish of Tadich Rice Custard Pudding (photo: http://bit.ly/13zCn4l). This was a rather disappointing wedge of blandness with the right consistency but lacking any distinctive flavor even with a spritz of whipped cream on the side. I have to say my virginal visit to the city's oldest restaurant was not an earth-shattering culinary experience, but somehow I knew that would be the case. Unlike Swan Oyster Depot, which turned out to be a true revelation, this one I can simply check off been-there-done-that my list.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...big portions but prices are on the absurd side and while quality is good, execution is downright boring\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...as old school as old school can be\nSERVICE - 4 stars...definitely attentive from waiters who live up to their own standard\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if you need a traditional SF seafood dining experience, then hop on the California Street cable car and go to Swan Oyster Depot...leave Tadich Grill to the Fodors-dependent foreign tourists", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Sand Dabs!

It's not cheap here, you know. \n\nC: Nonsense! We're so happy you two can help us simple Midwest folks from the Windy City find a decent place to dine. This is a famous spot, huh? Around since 1849. Impressive!\n\nB: Well, technically that's true. But also not. They've only been at this location since the 60s, before that they were elsewhere in the city, they changed ownership, wrangled over who would keep the name, and had profit-centered conflicts all too typical of the capitalist free market. \n\nA: Could you please drop the political economics for once? It's ruining my appetite, and I am looking forward to a serious seafood feast right about now. \n\nD: Oh let him talk. I like listening to your friend. He's so passionate about his views. I can respect that. And I've never eaten at a Croatian restaurant before. What should I get? The oysters Rockefeller? Or maybe the Lobster Thermidor? And what exactly are sand dabs, anyway? Wow! Looks like the menu for the Titanic.\n\nA: I don't think this place is like that. I mean, it's not really Croatian in that they don't specialize in regional or ethnic dishes. They are basically an all-American seafood, meat, and potato sort of place with a good bar, decent beer and wine selections, and a throwback, classy sort of wood-paneled atmosphere. It's not like a stereotypical Greek or Italian restaurant, in that sense. \n\nC: Well I don't know about you two gentlemen, but D. and I are ordering the Tadich Seafood Platter. A little bit of everything, from raw oysters and crab to smoked trout and marinated herring and shrimp cocktail. It will go great with a  few pints of Sierra Nevada. Hey! Is that Condi Rice on her second Dirty Martini? That's what I'm talkin' about, sistah!\n\nA: (ignores him). \n\nB: You know, it's hard to say exactly what a Croatian restaurant even should be like. The country has had a complicated history. Until recently, it was part of the Habsburg empire. After the First World War it became part of Yugoslavia. When it gained independence, it was under the influence of the Nazis (a touchy subject, still), and after that it was incorporated back into Yugoslavia under Tito. By the time you get to the 1990s and Croatia reemerges as a sovereign state, the whole mess in Bosnia and Kosovo further disrupted things. Now things are quieter, of course, but the bullet holes and emotional scars still very much remain. \n\nD: Well, we're hoping to take an Adriatic cruise next summer and see Dubrovnik. The pictures are gorgeous!\n\nB: Pictures can be deceiving, especially the glossy touristy kinds. There are still a lot of ghosts to deal with from the war. But that's true all over Europe, and beyond. Most people don't even know that the worst armed conflict in recent times happened in Central Africa, while Yugoslavia was falling apart at the seams.\n\nA: And no history lectures, either! Shut up and eat, for once in your life, OK?\n\nC: Look, here comes the seafood. Wow, that's a lot to handle!\n\nD: It sure is. They really pile it on the plates, don't they? No minimalist presentation here or gastronomic-molecular food display. This is about eating good in the neighborhood.\n\nB: (laughs). Cool pop cult reference. Such a public health catastrophe waiting to happen. You won't see me in THAT suburban 'hood anytime soon ...

I'm talking clams, jumbo shrimps, scallops, crab, and I don't know what else.  I seriously feel like after 5 minutes, all the soup disappeared or maybe there just wasn't much to start out with.  This dish is so perfect for a gloomy SF day.\n\nFor the latter, you get about 6 little sand dab fillets plus veggies plus four french fries and a LOT of tartar sauce.  Trust me, you will want to have dollups of tartar sauce with each bite of fish because it's just that good.  The sand dabs itself were cooked nicely but I don't know if I would get it a second time unless I was really craving it.\n\nI can't help but imagine that everything else is just as delicious.

And he got the liver which also looked good (he said it was perfect--not too many places do liver anymore).  My salad was wonderful, full of seafood.

The broth is tomato-based with herbs and wine in the mix.  Regarded as the signature dish of San Francisco (that's right, it's not Rice-a-Roni), there are plenty to be had this side of the bay.\n\nEstablished in 1849, Tadich Grill prides itself with its Seafood Cioppino.  Unlike most restaurants where the Dungeness crab legs are served in shells, they dish up a lazy man's version, i.e., no cracking is required because all the work has already been done in the kitchen.  They give out a good heap of crab meat on top of the stew.  Although the jumbo prawns and sea scallops helped make for a hearty bowl of cioppino, the broth didn't have much of that piquant flavor.  It was a bit lighter than my favorites over at Scoma's and Woodhouse Fish Co., but it was enjoyable nevertheless.\n\nAside from the Seafood Cioppino, the Dungeness Crab and Prawns a la Monza was another popular entr\u00e9e.  Baked in a ceramic cookware, it had shell-free crab meat and huge prawns over rice with some mushroom sauce, spices, and parmesan cheese.  Everything blended beautifully resulting in a very tasty casserole dish.\n\nTheir Clam Chowder came in two varieties - Boston and Coney Island (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tadich-grill-san-francisco?select=Vw6QzcgZU9rRoHikz-AVug).  There were plenty of clams in both, but MA won this one over NY.  The Boston variant had a richer consistency than the other which seemed to have the same broth as the cioppino.\n\nWe've also tried the Calamari Steak with Garlic Butter Sauce which was served with a side of steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  The calamari was perfectly pan fried.  It was tender with a nice crust and the garlic sauce was the perfect supplement.\n\nWith 167 years of experience, Tadich Grill is a very viable seafood option in San Francisco.

I won't say how long ago that was, but it was not long enough ago that I didn't remember it.  Don't remember having been back since...\n\nFast forward to Monday.  I met my sister and friend there for lunch.  We got there right at 11:30, to avoid the rush and lucked out and got seated in a booth.

S got the calves liver and K got the petrale sole.  These selections were so 1930!  I was a little disappointed with mine.  It was cooked too long.  The eggs were way well done, and the oysters were beyond the point where they retained any of their luscious liquors.  Also it definitely could have used more salt!  \n\nS.'s liver was perfectly medium (just pink) with lots of sauteed onions.  There aren't a lot of places where you can order liver at all, let alone perfectly cooked.  K's petrale sole was also expertly sauteed.  It was a large portion and very fresh.\n\nOur waiter was efficient to a fault, but pretty cold in demeanor.  I definitely got the message that he wanted to take care of business and turn the table.

Eat it proudly wearing the paper Tadich Grill bibs they bring.  The steaks are fabulous and come with huge \"longbranch\" potatoes, which are like fries on steroids.

I guess I've never been all that motivated, especially since they don't accept reservations, and frankly none of my friends and colleagues ever mention it as a place they've ever wanted to try. I remember there were work lunches and dinners scheduled there over the years, but for one reason or another, I bagged it or suggested some other place that was higher on my wish list. But last week, I decided I should give it a try since it was in the middle of the afternoon well after the lunch rush. I was in meeting hell at work until about 2:30PM and decided I needed to get out of the building.\n\nI was sincerely thinking of getting a sandwich at Andersen Bakery across California when it struck me that Tadich would likely be empty at that hour. I was right. Except for a couple of lady barflies near the entrance, there was nary a diner at what turned out to be the full dining counter that dominates the long space. You could almost smell the long history in the place filled as it is with rich dark woods, faded mustard walls, and a brass railing that separates the bar from the dining counter (photo: http://bit.ly/1emSaVF). There were quite a few waiters flitting about all looking like old-school veterans uniformed in ties and white linen jackets. The highly traditional menu is dominated by seafood, but you can get meats prepared on their charcoal broiler if you are feeling more carnivorous.\n\nI heard their $31.25 Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread is their house specialty as well as their $23.95 Pan-Fried Sand Dabs with Steak Fries. Neither appealed to me at that hour since they struck me as filling and probably a bit messy. I was drawn to the $30.95 Poached Wild King Salmon Filet with Chopped Egg Sauce because it sounded like it could be a comparatively healthier dish (photo: http://bit.ly/16WzPvz). Not really. The thick egg sauce was ladled quite liberally on the salmon which I have to admit was a hearty portion and quite fresh-tasting. It came with boiled potatoes and a bevy of steamed vegetables - broccoli and cauliflower florets, baby carrots and diced tomatoes. It was nothing too excited but certainly good enough for an undiscriminating palate.\n\nUnderstand this was on top of a large hunk of sourdough bread and a constant replenishment of frozen butter pats (photo: http://bit.ly/16o29XN).

The service however started to breakdown once the food was on the table after which our server was nowhere to be found.   Fortunately after the food was delivered we really didn't need anything but I certainly noticed that the server never bothered to check on us.  After we finished our food one of the guys (not a server) cleared the table and we found ourselves waiting for a dessert menu.   After I couldn't take it anymore I flagged down any server and just requested a dessert menu which was given to me right away.   I assume there was some server to server communication because within a minute or so our guy shows up and asked if we'd like to order a dessert.  I asked him if he'd forgotten about us and he said he had not forgotten about us but he had other tables to attend to.  I understood this poor excuse for poor service to mean that it was more important for him deliver good service to his other table than to our table.  Nonetheless, if he didn't realize that I/we felt we weren't getting adequate service...the fact that I told him I thought he forgot about us should have put him on notice.  \n\nOur dessert was delivered timely (Bourbon Bread Pudding) and it was great but again I found myself waiting for the server and the check.  At this point I was kind of over it...I just wanted to settle up and get out of there because this guy was really starting to work my nerves.\n\nWhen I finally got the server I just asked for the check (and gave him my credit card) which he brought quickly but when looking it over I realized that he'd charged me for a $38 steak that we didn't order.  Pointed out the \"mistake\" and he quickly agreed that it was something we didn't order.   It took him 10 to 15 minutes to go an resolve the check issue which tried to explain was the result of another party wanting separate checks?  He also stated that even though the $38 steak was on our bill we weren't actually charged for it.  \n\nIn summary, the food was outstanding but the service was at best a comedy of errors.  I'd actually like to go back and give them a try again (the food was that good).

Gotta be a real tourist trap, yeah?\n\nHoly crap, was I surprised.\n\nOn his recommendation, a coworker and myself wandered in just before the dinner rush, and promptly grabbed two seats at the long wooden bar. I ordered up a mineral water and a Manhattan, both of which were delivered promptly. The drink was an exercise in perfection - I'm a fan of the classic cocktails, and Tadich Grill just bloody nailed it.  My Manhattan was a pitch-perfect proportion of whiskey, bitters, and vermouth served chilled, but not ice cold.  A better cocktail I've not had in quite a while.  As a bonus, it was barely over $7, which is a relative bargain for a mixed drink in this city.\n\nI had a simple green salad tossed with oil and vinegar and a spot of ground black pepper to accompany my entree.  It was all it needed to be - basic, fresh, light, and green. For an entree, I ordered a whole grilled Mediterranean sea bass, which turned up cooked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside, light, tender and flaky on the inside.  I could have eaten two had I wanted to be a glutton.  Dressed with a little olive oil and lemon, this was an outstanding fish. The quarter-round of crusty sourdough bread Tadich provides was put to good use mopping up the plate afterward.  Bless them for serving Brussels sprouts as a side veg, too.  I love the things, though most people unfairly seem to dislike them with a passion.\n\nMy desert was a real classic - almost a relic, really - bourbon bread pudding, which was chock full of nuts, berries, raisins, and apples covered in a surprisingly not-cloying bourbon caramel sauce.  I had to stop halfway on this, and I'm not a guy who blithely discards desert.  It's really rich stuff, but it went a treat with a cup of coffee to end the meal.\n\nFor those that are used to the new school of restaurant service that includes an overly chipper server chirping the specials of the day at you after introducing themselves and kneeling down at table level to talk, I'm sure that the Tadich staff might seem a little stern.  They're not, though.  They're efficient, professional, and no-nonsense, and they're really good at keeping things moving in a busy place while not making you feel rushed.  And you know, I prefer it that way.\n\nSo, if you're visiting San Francisco, just go here.  It's one of those rare places that actually lives up to its reputation.

So even as busy as it was, we only waited 10 mins to be seated.\n\nOur waiter was French, and very efficient. I wouldn't say the waiters are exactly friendly, but they do work hard, they are helpful. We ordered the oysters to start, which were yumminess in a shell. I had the fillet of sole, and hubby had some sort of steak. Everything was delicious. The only snafu we had was that hubby ordered a glass of wine and the waiter forgot to bring it. He did eventually remember (without us having to ask), and was genuinely apologetic about forgetting.

I guess I've never been all that motivated, especially since they don't accept reservations, and frankly none of my friends and colleagues ever mention it as a place they've ever wanted to try. I remember there were work lunches and dinners scheduled there over the years, but for one reason or another, I bagged it or suggested some other place that was higher on my wish list. But last week, I decided I should give it a try since it was in the middle of the afternoon well after the lunch rush. I was in meeting hell at work until about 2:30PM and decided I needed to get out of the building.\n\nI was sincerely thinking of getting a sandwich at Andersen Bakery across California when it struck me that Tadich would likely be empty at that hour. I was right. Except for a couple of lady barflies near the entrance, there was nary a diner at what turned out to be the full dining counter that dominates the long space. You could almost smell the long history in the place filled as it is with rich dark woods, faded mustard walls, and a brass railing that separates the bar from the dining counter (photo: http://bit.ly/1emSaVF). There were quite a few waiters flitting about all looking like old-school veterans uniformed in ties and white linen jackets. The highly traditional menu is dominated by seafood, but you can get meats prepared on their charcoal broiler if you are feeling more carnivorous.\n\nI heard their $31.25 Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread is their house specialty as well as their $23.95 Pan-Fried Sand Dabs with Steak Fries. Neither appealed to me at that hour since they struck me as filling and probably a bit messy. I was drawn to the $30.95 Poached Wild King Salmon Filet with Chopped Egg Sauce because it sounded like it could be a comparatively healthier dish (photo: http://bit.ly/16WzPvz). Not really. The thick egg sauce was ladled quite liberally on the salmon which I have to admit was a hearty portion and quite fresh-tasting. It came with boiled potatoes and a bevy of steamed vegetables - broccoli and cauliflower florets, baby carrots and diced tomatoes. It was nothing too excited but certainly good enough for an undiscriminating palate.\n\nUnderstand this was on top of a large hunk of sourdough bread and a constant replenishment of frozen butter pats (photo: http://bit.ly/16o29XN). However, this didn't deter me from ordering the $6.95 dish of Tadich Rice Custard Pudding (photo: http://bit.ly/13zCn4l). This was a rather disappointing wedge of blandness with the right consistency but lacking any distinctive flavor even with a spritz of whipped cream on the side. I have to say my virginal visit to the city's oldest restaurant was not an earth-shattering culinary experience, but somehow I knew that would be the case. Unlike Swan Oyster Depot, which turned out to be a true revelation, this one I can simply check off been-there-done-that my list.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...big portions but prices are on the absurd side and while quality is good, execution is downright boring\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...as old school as old school can be\nSERVICE - 4 stars...definitely attentive from waiters who live up to their own standard\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if you need a traditional SF seafood dining experience, then hop on the California Street cable car and go to Swan Oyster Depot...leave Tadich Grill to the Fodors-dependent foreign tourists", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-08-05"}, {"excerpts": ["There were so many other items on the menu that I wanted but decided to go for what they are known for , the seafood Cioppino with garlic bread.

However there has always been a line and unfortunately they don't take reservations. (also it is hard to tell the capacity of the place by just looking through the front window:)) \n\nEither way, I've ready that they have the best Cioppino in San Francisco, so I wanted to try it. The experience started a little weird as we were greeted in a fairly serious manner and it was a little crowded. After a 55 minute wait for a table of 4 (it you are alone or just a couple, it is much faster to get a spot), we were taken to our table by the open kitchen. \n\nWe got the recommendations from the host, which were:\n\n1. Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread\n2. Oysters Rockefeller (appetizer)\n3. Chilean Sea Bass with Prawn Garnish\n4. Lobster and Crab Thermidor (Baked in Casserole)\n\nWe started off with a hearty bread and butter. This was great as we were very hungry and there was still time until we get our food... Then came the oysters. The spinach and the cheese with the oysters were great. By the time we finished the bread and the oysters, we were already full :) \n\nThen came the entr\u00e8es. I've always loved Sotto Mare's (North Beach on Green St.) Cioppino, which I still love, but Tardich Grill's Cioppino was exquisite. The tomato sauce was fresh and delicious. \n\nEven though I thought the rice and the sauce could get some improvement, the Chilean Sea Bass was the most moist and soft fish I had in San Francisco, just delicious. However, my second favorite was the Thermidor. With a little brandy flavor, the bechamel sauce and the huge chunks of crab and lobster, this was a seafood lovers delight! \n\nOverall, I think it was the best seafood I had in San Francisco. Very classic and traditional place, good service.

Bar seating here is actually better than at most smaller places, as it is very roomy and at the same time intimate.\n\nOnce seated, there is some mediocre bread waiting for you (it is already placed at each seat at the bar). You can only imagine how long that bread has been sitting there, and it shows. I wouldn't waste myself on it.\n\nFor the entrees, sure, the much hyped about Sand Dab Filets are pretty good, but for $24? That's a little silly. They come with the vegetable of the day, which was some weird thing that seemed like Chinese broccoli for some reason, and a starch. The fries didn't look so great, so we opted for the rice, foolishly thinking that it was the San Francisco Treat. The vegetable was pretty tasteless and the rice was nothing more than what you would get out of microwave minute rice.\n\nWe also got the Pacific Red Snapper which was also very tasty, but again, not worth it. We opted for the boiled potato with this one, and it was just as tasteless as it sounds.\n\nIt's a good thing this was just a snack to tide us over until we made our way to In-N-Out later (another reason we opted not to get the fries).\n\nI expected much better from this place, especially after seeing it on the 7x7 list and on the Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\nI would probably add a star if it wasn't so overpriced, and maybe if I wasn't allergic to shellfish, as I hear that the Cioppino is supposed to be really good. But if you are allergic to shellfish and you like a really satisfying meal without feeling like you are being gipped, then I would not recommend this place.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-07-14"}, {"excerpts": ["but I got a boiled potato.

The layout is a blast from the pork-pie hats at the bar past. The waiters are friendly, funny and attentive. I respect my elders, I really do. But in the end, food just isn't that good. Ouch. Sorry, grandma.\n\nThe best dish of the night was the halibut casserole...but I believe that if you drown anything in enough cheese, it'll taste good. \n\nMy Pacific oysters trio wasn't horrible, but out of the three kinds (rockefeller, creole and curry) I only liked one: the rockefeller. The creole and curry just didn't do it. Both were as if the star ingredients were slapped on top of the oyster and forced to mingle in my mouth. Nice, but I don't think either flavor wanted to be there. And the creole? Doesn't that mean some spice? Or am I mistaken? The rockefeller was more like it, with the cheese and the spinach interacting with the oyster. But like I said before, put enough cheese on something and it'll taste good.\n\nMy friends' sole dishes was like institution food. Limp greasy fillets of fish next to string beans and a boiled potato. Everything, save for the beans, was beige. Yawn. And the only way my friend could stomach the meal was with the help of lots of tartar sauce. That's not a good sign. The meat should be tasty enough to stand on its own. Without the help of sauce.\n\nAnd the dessert? Oh the shame. Cold bread pudding and cold rice custard pudding. The bread pudding was pleasant, very sweet with bits of apple. Edible but eh, a let down. The rice custard pudding was terrifying. A slab of eggy custard on top of grainy rice? Sorry, I couldn't eat more than a few bites. Maybe if they warmed up both desserts, I could have feigned more interest but I must say this is the first time in YEARS that I haven't finished my dessert.\n\nThe only reason why I'm being so harsh with the food here is because of the prices. If I was paying Red Lobster prices, then I'd be more understanding. But when you're paying $25+ for a meal you barely care for, it hurts.\n\nLike I said, I really wanted to like this place. Everything else was enjoyable. But man, the food, the most important part, not excusable. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that maybe I should have come for lunch? Or maybe I ordered the wrong thing? But my tummy hurts right now so I'm not a happy camper.\n\nLast thoughts and tips? If you see a restaurant packed with tourists, it's probably not a good sign. And don't try splitting your bill half on plastic and half in cash.

Unfortunately, we decided too late and they had just closed.  I called them and asked where they would recommend that we eat.  They suggested Tadich Grill and I am glad they did!  This was one of the best meals I (and the other two in our party) have ever had the pleasure to enjoy!\n\nWe started off with the a very good section of Sourdough bread, a Dungeness Crab Cake and Fried Calamari, both were fantastic!  The crab cake was full of huge chunks of tender crab smothered in a wonderful sauce.  The Calamari was equally as good, it was tender, not tough and seasoned just right.\n\nFor the main course I had the Fresh Alaskan Halibut Steak.  This was very light and tender and melted in my mouth.  It was served with a boiled potato and a mixture of vegetables.  The others relished the incredible Seafood Cioppino and the Mediterranean White Branzino Sea Bass.\n\nThis meal was simply unbelievable, as I said earlier, one of the best we ever had.  \n\nOh, I almost forgot about dessert, this WAS the best we ever had.  We all shared a single Chocolate Mousse (with wonderful drops of raspberry sauce on the side).  I am a self proclaimed chocoholic and have enjoyed Chocolate Mousse more than a few times in the past.  Hands down, this was the best Chocolate Mousse I have ever had.  It was presented in a hardened chocolate shell that contained the smoothest, lightest Chocolate Mousse you could ever imagine.  This is the LAST time I ever share one of those again!\nIf you don't go to Tadich's to enjoy a very fine meal and help them celebrate their 161st year in business, then at least go there for the Chocolate Mousse.
