Inevitably, our conversations always veer toward food, because Taiwanese food is the BEST. I'll most likely ask questions like, when's the last time you visited Taiwan? What's your favorite Taiwanese dish? Where can I get good Taiwanese food in SF? The last question always stumps people, because we just don't have many options, and I can't just Uber to Cupertino on a whim. I can, however, Uber to HoDaLa (what does this name mean tho?) for an authentic taste of Taiwan. \n\nMy friends entrusted me to order for the table, so I picked the gua bao (pork belly bun), niu rou zian bing (beef roll pancake), niu rou mian (braised beef noodle soup), and lu rou fan (ground pork over rice). \n\nThe gua bao came in 3 pieces per order, and the first bite took me back to all my vacations in Taiwan. The crushed peanuts provided a nice crunch to the tender pork belly. \n\nEveryone agreed that the niu rou jian bing was by far the standout. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS DISH. Despite being close friends, we were all being modest and/or selfless for some reason and nobody touched the last piece for a long time until I commanded W to just eat it. \n\nThe niu rou mian was pretty spicy, which the menu does warn you about. The broth was super flavorful but it was hard for me to drink much of it without chugging water. I'd still eat it again and again. \n\nLu rou fan was what I was most excited for, but I was somewhat disappointed. W and C were nice enough to let me eat most of the egg, but the rest of it was missing something. It's such a classic and might even seem like a poor man's dish, since it's pretty much scraps of pork mixed with rice, pickled veggies and sauce, but I guess it's actually hard to do right. It's the only item I wouldn't order again.\n\nIt would probably be a 5 star place if not for a weird service encounter when C was ordering a drink. He asked if they had boba? Nope, only grass jelly.

The sauce went really well with the peanut crumbs. The pork belly was cooked really well, it was juicy and meaty. \nGrounded Pork over Rice - Another traditional dish that was done very well. The ground pork was juicy and flavorful, it had a mixture of ground mushrooms in it as well so the texture was great. It had enough sauce to make the rice really tasty. It also came with some sour cabbage (my favorite), marinated egg and also pickled radish for garnish and taste. \nFried Pork Chop over Rice - I love how thin the breading of the pork chop was, and how juicy the meat was. The sauce was on point but it made the fried pork chop a bit soggy in the end. Overall was still a great entree especially with the bamboo shoots on the side. \nSizzling Beef with Black Pepper and Mushroom Sauce - The flavor of this dish was on point!

"], "author": "Amanda C.", "review": "Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, and boy were they packed with a line. Little known secret is to make a reservation, as those are first come first served and they have a limited amount they put aside for it. My boyfriend took nearly 45 minutes to find parking, so obviously take public transportation or rideshare to avoid such a waste of time. Luckily, he dropped me off to be seated first and I put in the order while waiting. The space is super small inside, but definitely gave me the Taiwanese restaurant vibe. I think it' mostly due to the decor of the space with candy and other goodies sold at the front and the seating behind the snacks. I started with a peach green tea, since boba tea originated in Taiwan. A bit disappointed that there wasn't boba with the drink. It was a little on the sweeter end versus tasting the actual tea, but it was okay. \n\nStarters:\n- Baked Cheese Corn: this plate came out a lot larger than I expected, but it was good! Cheese was good and the corn was sweet. I would definitely reorder when I return.\n- Beef Wrap: Gave this a try, but was disappointed. The wrap was very dry as a whole and the pieces fell apart so easily that it was not easy to eat. Flavor was also lacking in the wrap, and the meat had a bit of flavor but was super dry. \n\nMain Course:\n- Braised Beef Noodle Soup (spicy): The bowl was fairly large, and had a good kick of spice to it that I could handle. It wasn't overpowering so that you could taste the flavor of the rest of the dish, but a perfect amount for me to taste all the flavors. Noodles were a great texture and perfect firmness and the meat fell apart easily as it should for this dish.\n- Sizzling Whole Squid with Peppered and Mushroom Sauce: Originally I didn't want this because I don't like mushrooms, but the mushroom was just in the sauce and not all over the dish so I could deal. The peppery flavor was very apparent in the noodles and the fried squid was huge! Super flavorful and I couldn't finish the dish - had to take it home and it still was two more meals for me after that from this one dish.\n\nOverall, it was around $50 something to try all those dishes.

Just like the ones you'd get in a night market. The steak was too tough imo and the noodle was overcooked.

It was very hyped up for me and it definitely lived up to the hype, and this is coming from a Taiwanese girl who's from 626. The restaurant decor is very throwback with a ton of good ol Taiwanese candy, snacks and posters. \n\nI went so ham and ordered 6 things for 3 people. \nStir Fried Preserved Egg with Sweet Potato Leaves - Sweet potato leaves is such a Taiwanese staple vegetable, the preserved egg went really well with it, I'm definitely going to steal this recipe. \nPork Belly Gua Bao - The flavor is on point and the bao was fluffy, delicious and with a sweet aftertaste. The sauce went really well with the peanut crumbs. The pork belly was cooked really well, it was juicy and meaty. \nGrounded Pork over Rice - Another traditional dish that was done very well. The ground pork was juicy and flavorful, it had a mixture of ground mushrooms in it as well so the texture was great. It had enough sauce to make the rice really tasty. It also came with some sour cabbage (my favorite), marinated egg and also pickled radish for garnish and taste. \nFried Pork Chop over Rice - I love how thin the breading of the pork chop was, and how juicy the meat was. The sauce was on point but it made the fried pork chop a bit soggy in the end. Overall was still a great entree especially with the bamboo shoots on the side. \nSizzling Beef with Black Pepper and Mushroom Sauce - The flavor of this dish was on point! Just like the ones you'd get in a night market. The steak was too tough imo and the noodle was overcooked. I'd skip this dish next time.\n\nMy favorite of the meal was the TOMATO BEEF NOODLE SOUP, I was obsessed. It reminded me of my childhood, and I had always been on a search for tomato based bns. This place has done a perfect job, and it had a really nice kick to the broth as well. The beef was also a perfect balance of tendon and meat. \n\nI'd have to come back here again if I'm ever visiting sf!!

Little known secret is to make a reservation, as those are first come first served and they have a limited amount they put aside for it. My boyfriend took nearly 45 minutes to find parking, so obviously take public transportation or rideshare to avoid such a waste of time. Luckily, he dropped me off to be seated first and I put in the order while waiting. The space is super small inside, but definitely gave me the Taiwanese restaurant vibe. I think it' mostly due to the decor of the space with candy and other goodies sold at the front and the seating behind the snacks. I started with a peach green tea, since boba tea originated in Taiwan. A bit disappointed that there wasn't boba with the drink. It was a little on the sweeter end versus tasting the actual tea, but it was okay. \n\nStarters:\n- Baked Cheese Corn: this plate came out a lot larger than I expected, but it was good! Cheese was good and the corn was sweet. I would definitely reorder when I return.\n- Beef Wrap: Gave this a try, but was disappointed. The wrap was very dry as a whole and the pieces fell apart so easily that it was not easy to eat. Flavor was also lacking in the wrap, and the meat had a bit of flavor but was super dry. \n\nMain Course:\n- Braised Beef Noodle Soup (spicy): The bowl was fairly large, and had a good kick of spice to it that I could handle. It wasn't overpowering so that you could taste the flavor of the rest of the dish, but a perfect amount for me to taste all the flavors. Noodles were a great texture and perfect firmness and the meat fell apart easily as it should for this dish.\n- Sizzling Whole Squid with Peppered and Mushroom Sauce: Originally I didn't want this because I don't like mushrooms, but the mushroom was just in the sauce and not all over the dish so I could deal. The peppery flavor was very apparent in the noodles and the fried squid was huge! Super flavorful and I couldn't finish the dish - had to take it home and it still was two more meals for me after that from this one dish.\n\nOverall, it was around $50 something to try all those dishes.

After looking on Yelp, I got an order of the pork belly buns and an order of the \"sizzling meat lover\", which looked very good in pictures. After eating, however, my overall analysis is that there are better options close by (just head up to Clement and go in almost anywhere - there are so many good and cheap restaurants nearby!)\n\nUnfortunately, the pork belly buns I would have to say were just pretty bland and a little dry; they could really use a little fish sauce or some other kind of sauce to liven them up. \n\nI definitely enjoyed the meat lovers more; the noodles were served with a tasty broth and properly cooked meats. It's not a soup but it's a little more juicy than say an Italian noodle dish. Definitely enjoyable, but still nothing to write home about - it was just good, nothing special. Unfortunately, this was priced at $19.95. (I did notice that price is $1 cheaper in the restaurant vs delivery)\n\nBetween the pricing and lack of anything special, 3 stars felt right. I'm not upset but i am disappointed. You can get better buns for $1.30 each just a few blocks away, or better noodles for less money even cheaper, and that's what you should do. \n\nI did notice there are some items on the menu - especially the cheaper entrees - that were not on uber eats, so perhaps I will stop by in person or get take out to try them sometime.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-06-16"}], "sizzling surf and turf": [], "fried tangyuan rice ball w peaunt": [], "sesame bao steamed": [], "red bean bao steamed": [], "custard steamed bao steamed": [], "deep fried swirly roll": [], "taro ball shaved ice": [{"excerpts": ["After looking at the menu for a few minutes, we ordered the taro ball shaved ice (substituted mochi instead of boba) a milk tea with grass jelly and we were curious about the Taiwan beer with lychee "], "author": "Stacey Y.", "review": "I wanted some dessert after dinner and HoDaLa was within walking distance from where I was so we decided to give it a try!\n\nIt's a nice spot and it reminds me of Taiwan in some ways.
