I'm usually not a fan of thick crust, but theirs has a delicious bread-like taste, mixed each day in that huge monolith of a Kitchenaid standmixer in the back room. Slices are large and toppings are generous, but not so overwhelming that it sinks the slice like the Titanic when I hold it in one hand. Just one slice and I'm satisfied with a full tummy and the nostalgia of all those late night noshings a certain stressed out college kid used to do on midterm nights. And considering the amount of OT hours I've been racking up lately, I've become quite a regular here. \n\nI usually ask for the veggie pizza slice, add chicken, and I love how it doesn't taste greasy. Depending on who completes my order, I sometimes get an additional sprinkling of cheese on top, and they'll always give it a quick pop in the oven to re-warm it and make sure the bottom stays crunchy. \n\nIn addition, the guys that run the place are always extra nice to me. From what I've seen they've been very accommodating to picky pizza eaters wanting their slices done a certain way, but get confused easily when someone orders an item others rarely pick (like the antipasto salad). \n\n5 stars, although I haven't tried their delivery services yet.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-09-11"}], "hot sandwich with fries and cheese": [], "philly sandwich": [], "chicken pesto sandwich with fries": [], "hamburger with fries": [], "add cheese": [], "small milan calzone": [], "small vegetarian calzone": [{"excerpts": ["I also ordered the SMALL vegetarian calzone, which the menu said was $13......
