Shockingly, although I'm 1/2 Japanese, I'm allergic to fish. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. How odd. Moving on. \n\nIt's Saturday and after a failed attempt at dropping off the Comcast equipment next door at the Comcast store, Eugy and I decide to drop in here for lunch. We ordered:\n\nGyoza - decent gyoza but you can tell it's the frozen kind\nGoma ae - The sesame sauce used for this was bleh... \nTako sunomono - though the tako was good, this was not true sunomono and the cucumbers had not marinated in the sake/vinegar mixture long enough to soak up any flavor. \n\nand for rolls, I can't really remember the names. They were very inventive with their rolls and even had a picture album on the bar so you could see what it looked like. We had a roll with shrimp tempura, crab, avocado and cucumber. And another roll which was basically a california roll with baked scallops in spicy mayo on top. Both were really good, but the baked scallops one was kinda hard to eat. Due to being baked, the rolls were falling apart. It was still tasty though. \n\nService was polite and the place is clean. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back here though.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-05-06"}], "pcs sushi": [], "tuna sashimi": [{"excerpts": ["They use good quality fish for the tuna sashimi.
