Apparently packed in the evenings, it was somewhat empty at 1PM, though it did get a little more crowded by 2PM. Lunch is served through 3PM. This Fresca is the 3rd and newest one to open, formerly Tien Fu, a Chinese restaurant, first owned by the Calvo Perez family in 1996. Chef Julio Calvo Perez overseas the food here, while his son Jose oversees the Fillmore location, and Julio and his wife Zoila oversee the original West Portal location. When you enter, you will see a vaulted barrel ceiling, an exhibition kitchen, and two bars, one for drinks, and the other with over 8 preparations of their famed ceviche. Service can be sketchy and harried when they're busy, but my friend and I had fine service from a waitress who looked like Rachel Weisz. The maitre d' is pretty cute too. There's a specials board, so be sure to read it so that you don't miss the tiraditos, Peruvian-style sashimi. Be sure and try their balsamic strawberry margarita [strawberries and balsamic vinegar with Commemorativo tequila (gold anejo of 51% agave), sweet n sour (a mix of lemon juice, the juice of green lemons, sugar and sometimes egg white), and Peruvian pink sea salt (harvested from terraced ponds in the Andes mountains)]; it was quite yummy. My friend had a Pisco sour (Pisco is a Peruvian brandy made from the distillation of muscat grapes, grown near the city of Pisco), which was also quite nice. I quite liked the complimentary biscuits brought to our table. For our appetizer, we had the ceviche \"5 elementos\", $10: the traditional Peruvian ceviche of halibut, lime juice, red onion, sea salt, and Rocoto (a medium-sized round pepper common in Peru and Bolivia) aji (Peruvian chili sauce); it also came with a garnish of lettuce, a tiny piece of corn on the cob, a piece of yam, and Peruvian cancha (large, individually roasted kernels of corn). It was so very good. I had a hard time deciding on which ceviche to order. At dinnertime there is a seviche sampler, so I recommend that one. At lunch there are 6 ceviches available, and 4 (though not all the same as on the lunch menu) are available for lunch take-out. For our main entrees, we both ordered bocadillos (Spanish for little sandwiches, the term can also refer to snacks or finger foods), which come with a choice of French fries or green salad. I had a green salad with my Pan con Lomito (meat from the back of the cow), $8, $8.50 for take-out: sirloin steak strips wok-fried with onions and tomatoes, cilantro aioli, and Jack cheese on Dutch crunch bread. I cannot tell you how good it tasted. And a pretty sizable portion as well. It was filled with flavor, oozing its juices onto my plate. My friend had the Pollo Criollo (Peruvian Creole style cooking): sauteed chicken breast and onions smothered with Peruvian Creole mustard sauce, Jack cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes on toasted Dutch crunch, also $8. My friend loved this sandwich. The rest of the menu looked very good, and I definitely want to come back and try the rest of it.
