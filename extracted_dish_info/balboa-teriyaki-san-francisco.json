"], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "Although I don't generally spend a lot of time in this part of the Richmond, I used to be kind of curious about Balboa Teriyaki.  A few friends who grew up nearby and came here as kids would speak rather fondly about them, but I never knew if it was because the food was actually good or just nostalgia.  Now, after having tried them, I can only assume it was due to the latter because, otherwise, I might have to start questioning their taste in Japanese food!\n\nWhile my first trip here was more than enough for me to evaluate Balboa Teriyaki, the (anal) Yelper in me felt compelled to give them another shot.  Not so much in the spirit of being thorough, but because my friend made the unfortunate point that I didn't actually try their namesake teriyaki dishes.  Ugh.  Fortunately though, I didn't have to worry about repeating everything all over again, as the menu is decently varied, albeit with standard offerings (small plates, sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, udon, etc.).\n\n**I heard that the prices may have changed, so these may not be accurate anymore.\n\n-- HAMACHI NIGIRI...$5.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=58QJUpWbZpjqT55-BXIf-g)\nPossibly the best thing I had, which might not be saying much.  While it was a sizable piece, the cut of the fish was a bit awkward (there was a big tendon down the middle) and it had a small dollop of minced ginger, which I'd never seen before.  Still, it tasted fine and was decently fresh, so I can't complain too much.\n\n-- GIRL BOY ROLL - Shrimp Tempura, Cream Cheese, and Avocado topped with Tuna, Salmon, Eel Sauce, and Tobiko...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=_O5ERmHKqzpBQIii4xceSw)\nEven though all of the components naturally complemented each other, this didn't really stand out.  The salmon wasn't too shabby, and the avocados were ripe, but the tuna didn't do much for me (almost tasteless).  As for the tempura, I didn't care for the texture of the batter (kind of mealy), though it tasted okay.\n\n-- POKE SALAD - Assorted Sashimi, Daikon, Seaweed Salad, Spring Mix, Kaiware, Cucumber, and Tobiko topped with Special and Spicy Sauces....$13.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=99ju2z61n4r1UEZLP023VA)\nThe order was a lot larger than I had expected, but nothing special otherwise.  Although they were fairly generous with the portion, the fish didn't seem especially fresh (they definitely weren't prime cuts).  Then again, the sauce might've had something to do with it, as it was pretty sharp/acidic.\n\n-- DINNER BENTO BOX - Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Katsu, and Gyoza...$16.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=KIt3bDAsjtONbAPvFGQjFQ)\nTo be honest, the chicken teriyaki was easily the worst thing I had.  It didn't have much of a char, it tasted like it might've been previously frozen, and it was sprinkled with seaweed (??).  The katsu was slightly better, if only because #fried, but the breading was paper thin.  As for the gyoza, they weren't awful, but they weren't exactly special either (ditto for the salad and miso soup).\n\n-- ORANGE DRAGON ROLL - Shrimp Tempura and Cucumber topped with Salmon, Spicy Mayo, Unagi Sauce, and Tobiko...$12.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=dMLjN6hACaEV66Pqz_lHqw)\nIt wasn't part of the plan to get a roll so similar to the Girl Boy one, but it felt like a relatively safe choice.  Though the salmon wasn't bad, nothing else was that great.  Sadly, we ran into the same problems with the shrimp tempura (though it was tastier this time).  Plus, it had carrots in it, which was kind of odd.\n\nAlso, I can't say I was a big fan of their sushi rice in either the nigiri or the rolls.  Both times, it was almost flavorless and had a gummy sort of consistency.  That said, despite the disappointing food, neither meal was a complete failure.  Service was consistently friendly and they gave a free appetizer with each meal - a fried ball of salmon (I think...) and a grilled shrimp skewer (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=OFvh4QaVeAM0O3CwMseweQ).\n\nAll in all, despite the service and the free food, neither was enough for me to give anything more than two stars.  Maybe if I had some old memories to go with them, but alas...I don't.

"], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "Although I don't generally spend a lot of time in this part of the Richmond, I used to be kind of curious about Balboa Teriyaki.  A few friends who grew up nearby and came here as kids would speak rather fondly about them, but I never knew if it was because the food was actually good or just nostalgia.  Now, after having tried them, I can only assume it was due to the latter because, otherwise, I might have to start questioning their taste in Japanese food!\n\nWhile my first trip here was more than enough for me to evaluate Balboa Teriyaki, the (anal) Yelper in me felt compelled to give them another shot.  Not so much in the spirit of being thorough, but because my friend made the unfortunate point that I didn't actually try their namesake teriyaki dishes.  Ugh.  Fortunately though, I didn't have to worry about repeating everything all over again, as the menu is decently varied, albeit with standard offerings (small plates, sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, udon, etc.).\n\n**I heard that the prices may have changed, so these may not be accurate anymore.\n\n-- HAMACHI NIGIRI...$5.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=58QJUpWbZpjqT55-BXIf-g)\nPossibly the best thing I had, which might not be saying much.  While it was a sizable piece, the cut of the fish was a bit awkward (there was a big tendon down the middle) and it had a small dollop of minced ginger, which I'd never seen before.  Still, it tasted fine and was decently fresh, so I can't complain too much.\n\n-- GIRL BOY ROLL - Shrimp Tempura, Cream Cheese, and Avocado topped with Tuna, Salmon, Eel Sauce, and Tobiko...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=_O5ERmHKqzpBQIii4xceSw)\nEven though all of the components naturally complemented each other, this didn't really stand out.  The salmon wasn't too shabby, and the avocados were ripe, but the tuna didn't do much for me (almost tasteless).  As for the tempura, I didn't care for the texture of the batter (kind of mealy), though it tasted okay.\n\n-- POKE SALAD - Assorted Sashimi, Daikon, Seaweed Salad, Spring Mix, Kaiware, Cucumber, and Tobiko topped with Special and Spicy Sauces....$13.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=99ju2z61n4r1UEZLP023VA)\nThe order was a lot larger than I had expected, but nothing special otherwise.  Although they were fairly generous with the portion, the fish didn't seem especially fresh (they definitely weren't prime cuts).  Then again, the sauce might've had something to do with it, as it was pretty sharp/acidic.\n\n-- DINNER BENTO BOX - Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Katsu, and Gyoza...$16.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=KIt3bDAsjtONbAPvFGQjFQ)\nTo be honest, the chicken teriyaki was easily the worst thing I had.  It didn't have much of a char, it tasted like it might've been previously frozen, and it was sprinkled with seaweed (??).  The katsu was slightly better, if only because #fried, but the breading was paper thin.  As for the gyoza, they weren't awful, but they weren't exactly special either (ditto for the salad and miso soup).\n\n-- ORANGE DRAGON ROLL - Shrimp Tempura and Cucumber topped with Salmon, Spicy Mayo, Unagi Sauce, and Tobiko...$12.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=dMLjN6hACaEV66Pqz_lHqw)\nIt wasn't part of the plan to get a roll so similar to the Girl Boy one, but it felt like a relatively safe choice.  Though the salmon wasn't bad, nothing else was that great.  Sadly, we ran into the same problems with the shrimp tempura (though it was tastier this time).  Plus, it had carrots in it, which was kind of odd.\n\nAlso, I can't say I was a big fan of their sushi rice in either the nigiri or the rolls.  Both times, it was almost flavorless and had a gummy sort of consistency.  That said, despite the disappointing food, neither meal was a complete failure.  Service was consistently friendly and they gave a free appetizer with each meal - a fried ball of salmon (I think...) and a grilled shrimp skewer (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=OFvh4QaVeAM0O3CwMseweQ).\n\nAll in all, despite the service and the free food, neither was enough for me to give anything more than two stars.  Maybe if I had some old memories to go with them, but alas...I don't.
