Such attention to detail really made an amazing sandwich. #1 - the slices of bread were toasted/grilled with butter/olive oil on both sides before being assembled into a sandwich. #2 - the bacon was perfectly cooked to crispy without being burnt. #3 - they use some quality gruyere because it had a whiff of that stinky funky cheese smell. I kept sniffing like what's that smell then realized it was the cheese. #4 - the cheese was melted into the kale and leeks while the bacon was kept crispy. And of course #5 - a soft cooked egg in a hole on top.\n\nSeriously good breakfast sandwich and it's so close to me! I'd put it up right up there with my other favorite breakfast sandwich at Devil's Teeth Baking.\n\nPS This is a small place and by the time i showed up at 11:15 all the tables were taken with (surprise surprise) people on laptops leaving just the outside tables and inside bar free.

Breakfast until 11:30 but you can get takeaway and essentially make the breakfast sandwich your lunch, as I did because I can't ever get up early enough to have that big of a breakfast followed by a lunch.\n\nThe sandwich is the first one on the menu - Egg Sandwich w/ Bacon (fried egg, braised kale + leek, and gruyere on Della Fattoria levain). There are two prices $7.50 (egg sandwich) and $9 (w/ bacon). Not as apparent as they might have thought because I had to ask. \n\nI have to admit, when I opened the takeaway box and saw a plain looking sandwich I was a little disappointed. It just looked so plain. It looks exactly like the photos so I didn't feel tricked, I think I just wasn't paying attention. However one bite and my mind was blown. Such attention to detail really made an amazing sandwich. #1 - the slices of bread were toasted/grilled with butter/olive oil on both sides before being assembled into a sandwich. #2 - the bacon was perfectly cooked to crispy without being burnt. #3 - they use some quality gruyere because it had a whiff of that stinky funky cheese smell. I kept sniffing like what's that smell then realized it was the cheese. #4 - the cheese was melted into the kale and leeks while the bacon was kept crispy. And of course #5 - a soft cooked egg in a hole on top.\n\nSeriously good breakfast sandwich and it's so close to me! I'd put it up right up there with my other favorite breakfast sandwich at Devil's Teeth Baking.\n\nPS This is a small place and by the time i showed up at 11:15 all the tables were taken with (surprise surprise) people on laptops leaving just the outside tables and inside bar free.
