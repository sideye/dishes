I had the Sauerbraten and she had the J\u00e4gerschnitzel and we split and order of the brad and butter and potato pancakes. The bread had a nice slightly sour flavor to it and the potato pancakes were nice and crispy on the outside but soft in the middle with a good flavor. The sauerbraten was well cooked and served with sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage. The wife's j\u00e4gerschnitzel was also good and the gravy was excellent. Both of us were happy with our meals.

Last night I visited again and was really looking forward to enjoying the J\u00e4gerschnitzel, which I've had several times here in the past. \n\nUnfortunately they've changed their method of preparing it. Traditionally, J\u00e4gerschnitzel is prepared by pounding the cutlets so they are thin, breading the cutlets, and frying them, then topping them with a mushroom sauce. I've had it at Suppenk\u00fcche before and this is how they prepare it. \n\nThis time, they apparently just pan seared a pork chop that was was cut in half and topped it with mushroom sauce. When I told the waiter I wanted to send it back and have it prepared the way J\u00e4gerschnitzel is normally prepared--just like Wienerschnitzel-- he argued with me and said this is the way J\u00e4gerschnitzel is always prepared. I informed that I lived in Austria for two years and it's not prepared like this, and in fact I've had it prepared the right way at Suppenk\u00fcche in the past. \n\nHe took it back and returned a few minutes later. The cook just took the same chops off my plate, fried them, and poured the mushroom sauce over them. It wasn't pounded thin. At that point I just gave up and ate it. \n\nAnother person in our party orders the sauerbraten and it was a tiny portion. He wasn't happy about that. \n\nI ordered a side of Kn\u00f6deln (a dumpling of sorts), something I very much enjoyed when I lived in Austria. These ones were heavy, pasty, and flavorless. \n\nOn the other hand the pork knuckle, potato pancakes, and gemischte Salat were all terrific. \n\nAs disappointing as this visit was I will give it another try at some point.

Good flavors all in all, but a bit too salty and plain to me: I mean, yes, there's a lot of flavor in the meatloaf itself, but all the plate is is a slice of meatloaf and a heaping of mashed potatoes, which'll run you $18.50.\n\nSo, the real issue here is highlighted by the last item above: it's not that Suppenkuche is bad, it's just that it's not good enough for me to justify going again, given the prices. If not for what I consider to be slightly poor value, they'd qualify for a low three stars instead.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - There's a large single step ledge at the entrance, which can be traversed with the aid of a somewhat narrow, portable steel ramp that the staff can bring outside for you.

Not that stuff you get in jars/they serve at hotdog stands. ACTUAL sauerkraut that wasn't too acidic. The bratwurst was good though, I can't even describe it. \n\nDRINK:\nI got the bananaweizen.

Many of the main dishes came with the same couple of sides--salad, potato, and my favorites--braised red cabbage and spaetzle.

Cross between the look and cut of spam to the texture like cured Vietnamese meat. It was so flavorful, and hearty. The roasted potatoes and the two sunny side eggs on top added additional protein for a substantial meal that calls for an afternoon nap.\n\nMy girlfriend got the pork chop which is part of their regular menu. The entire pork chop was cured. So very different than what we are used to but it tasted amazing. The pork chop had texture like holiday ham in its hearty briny flavor that never ceases to be perfection. It sat on top of creamy mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, which gave the pork chop depth and richness. So yummy! Flavor combinations were spot on. I only wished we had room for the potato pancakes. \n\nI look forward to going back here again.

"], "author": "Mike R.", "review": "We ate here for the first time last week.  Reviews by my party of three were mixed: I was fairy enthused, my wife was wholly unimpressed, and our friend split the difference. \n\nWe shared several dishes and, as others have pointed out, it's impossible to finish what you are served, so leftovers were inevitable.  We shared a composed salad that included beets, cabbage, carrots, potato salad, and butter lettuce with a lovely vinaigrette.  If you can accept \"simple\" as an adjective to describe your starter, this was great.  We also had potato pancakes, which were a bit less successful.  The exterior surfaces were nice and crusty, but the interior wasn't so flavorful, and the \"apple sauce\" was not what those raised on Mott's would expect, but, rather, a fruity syrup.  \n\nMy wife ordered the wienerschnitzel, about which none of us was too enthused. The pork was a bit tough, the batter unseasoned, and the promised green salad conspicuously absent.  Our friend ordered the bratwurst, which were very flavorful, but not what we expected: they were not plump at all, but, rather, about the form factor of a hot dog.  Once the surprise about their appearance wore off, we enjoyed these.  Finally, I ordered the meatloaf.  It was a bit dry, but, otherwise, it was lovely.  It had overtones of, I think, sage and a nice hardboiled egg in its middle, and the mushroom gravy was rich and delicious.  Sides included delicious roasted potatoes alongside the wienerschnitizel, mashed potatoes with the bratwurst and meatloaf, and a world-class sauerkraut added to the bratwurst.  There were leftover sausage pieces and meatloaf to take home.\n\nThe beer list is pretty long and appeared esoterically German.  I don't know enough about it to be aware of whether Suppenkuche covered all the bierkeller bases, but I found a really enjoyable cider that went well with the hearty food.\n\nNearly all seating is communal; luckily, we had respectful table companions.  Service is competent, with the bussers checking on us more often than our order taker; our order taker was very, very gracious about correcting a small error on our bill, so kudos to her for a good attitude.  Noise level is nuts, however; by the time all the tables filled in, we could not hear anything said at our table, so I downgrade a bit for that, as well.\n\nFinally, I am downgrading one star for this very specific reason:  Neither the person who seated us and handed us menus nor the order taker ever mentioned there were specials. We learned of them only as we were getting up to leave and saw some incredible-looking, big fat sausages on another diner's plate.  At that point, the bus person we asked about the sausages told us that they were on the \"specials menu.\"  The specials menu turned out to be a thing: it was left on each of the tables, but, at our table, it never left the side occupied by the other party, so we had zero awareness of it.  When we looked at it, we each decided that we'd have ordered something else than we actually had ordered, i.e., a salmon dish for my wife, the sausages (which were made from wild boar) for our friend, and a roast suckling pig dish for me.  The specials might be the only thing that actually gets us back to Suppenkuche.

If it hadn't been so over-seasoned, the German Ravioli would've been the star of the show. One thing that we did like were the warm pretzels, which were paired with what appeared to be a cream cheese/curry sauce. The pretzels were fantastic - chewy and salty, and everything you would expect. The cream cheese-based sauced could use some work, but offered an interesting perspective on the pretzels, at least. The last thing we ordered was another pork dish that was one of their nightly specials, and it came with a German dumpling and sauerkraut.

The very picture of the boot fills me with dread and loathing. Much like a peroxided drag queen from Atlanta, I am usually never tardy for a party. But, I didn't get this place. At all. I kept wondering if I were in the twilight zone. It must be me. Everyone else seems to love this place. Even one of my oldest (as in time known, not age) friends is a fan. What am I missing? Perhaps I should start by describing what I received.\n\n1.) Pushes and shoves. I get it. The place is busy. It's small. It's packed at all times. When my largish party arrived for our reservation, the place was in the weeds and they weren't ready for us. There's no waiting area to speak of, so we sort of just stood in the middle of the room. I know. Brilliant. The waiters, in an effort to, I dunno, actually do their jobs, needed to tell us to get out of the way or move us out of their way. I get it. Really, I do. But, rather than a scene out of Whip It, how about having a large table ready at time of reservation or instruct us to wait in a specific area? I left to wait outside. I couldn't handle the chaos. Whilst outside, I was greeted by a smell so foul The Stinky Cheese Man was, like, \"d@mn!\" This was not the fault of Suppenk\u00fcche. I'm just sayin'.;\n\n2.) A hair stuck to my menu. I have about as much hair as Natalie Portman with a Vendetta. 'twas not mine, but there it was, greeting me like the hostess I never met. A long scraggly hair stuck to a menu is not the best second impression to make.;\n\n3.) Pushy service. At one *point* in the meal, our waiter actually poked my friend. Poked! As in, extend forefinger and forcibly jab someone with it. WTH was I?;\n\n4.) Boring food. Sp\u00e4tzle can knock your socks off (see, Morso). J\u00e4gerschnitzel can make you moan uncontrollably (see my friend's mom's food). This... filled me up. I noshed on potato pancakes ($11!!!), chicken dish of the day and potatoes. \"Why would you order chicken?\" Because it was a special and I thought it would taste special. It was okay. The pancakes ($11!!!) were the highlight of the meal.;\n\n5.) Nausea. Drinking beer out of a communal boot might be one of the most horrifically nauseating dining experiences I can imagine. Swig after swig of backwash, germs, food particles from other people, sloshing around in yeast... I might be sick if I write any more. A personal hell.;\n\n6.) Good beer.

My only other experience with German food was at a sub-par Gastropub where food was bleh and service was worse. I expected Suppenkuche to be similar but with better food and booze. I was so pleasantly surprised in every way.\n\nSuppenkuche is actually a small restaurant of two adjoining rooms. It has picnic-like wooden tables that were all lit with candles for a warm, cozy atmosphere. Although the hostess said the wait was 30-45 mins, my bf and I were seated within 5. They had a good selection of beer so that's what we started with - a dark Doppelbock for him and a sweet Hefe for me. I'd read great things about the saut\u00e9ed pork w/ mushrooms but neither of us were pork fans. My bf ordered the skirt steak from the Christmas Eve menu and I ordered the braised beef.\n\nThe food was amazing! I love that it was so savory and bursting with flavor. It had a different taste than what I'm used to with Asian or other ethnic foods. The braised beef was soft and had a slight alcohol taste as if were marinated in cider. It came with cranberry sauce and spatzle, which I think is sauerkraut immersed in a red sauce. The spatzle was good but I ate it sparingly so I wouldn't drown out the beef which was already drenched in its own sauce. \n\nThe piece I had of my bf's steak was also delicious, so flavorful that I'm sure it wasn't just cooked with salt and pepper. It came with a side of fried potatoes and bacon bits that was a trillion times better than grocery store-bought bacon. Although a little pricey at $18.50 a plate, the portions were so large that it completely filled my bf's hearty appetite and left me with leftovers. \n\nI still don't know how to pronounce anything but I do know that I've become a fan of German food.

The food, the beer, and the overall environment just summed up to an awesome night. If you have a slightly larger group I highly suggest calling in to make a reservation. They'll seat you in the back room where the tables are a lot longer and can fit more people.\n\nThe restaurant is casual and fits the name of the establishment which means \"soup kitchen\" in English.

These scrumptous discs of joy are SO addicting! Any fan of hashbrowns will immediately fall in love with these easily. I know I did. The potatoes are shredded and are extra crispy when fried. The apple sauce might seem like a weird combination at first, but it works! \n\nFor my main dish I tried the Sauteed Venison Medallions in Red Wine Plum Sauce with Red Cabbage & Sp\u00e4tzle (Gebratene Rehmedaillions in Rotwein-Pflaumenso\u00dfe mit Rotkohl und Sp\u00e4tzle). I didn't taste much of the gamey flavor with the Venison so that was good. The meat consistency was a little tougher than beef, but aside from the meat being a little chewy it was still a great dish. \n\nThe Red Cabbage has a sweet, tart flavor that can be a hit or miss with people. I personally enjoy it so I didn't mind having it on my plate. It actually comes with most of the dishes at Suppenk\u00fcche. The Sp\u00e4tzle look like little pieces of noodles and works as the carbs of the dish.\n\nI got to sample some of my friends dishes so I know what I would like to order and not order next time I come.  The Grilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes (Kassler vom Grill mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei) has a really delicious and tender pork. It tasted like a chunk of ham.

This tasted like Pork Tonkatsu and I wasn't a fan of the roasted potatoes. I'm a hashbrown person all the way.\n\nOn to the BEER. I'm a big fan of Belgian brews so I tried the Blanche de Bruxelles that comes in a 0.3 liter size. It's a Belgian White beer so it has a light and cloudy/hazy apperance, but it also has a bold flavor that I thought was stronger than the Hefeweizen. It didn't match too well with the Venison, but it was worth trying.\n\nWith all the beer and food I was totally ready to K.O. after my meal.

I've had a recent obsession with spaetzle, so the J\u00e4gerschnitzel is perfect - mushroom sauce over pork loin and spaetzle.

They also had a half roasted chicken that was super flavorful.\n\nThey have tons of beer, but I might be the only person who prefers the Gruner Veltliner (one of my favorite types of Austrian/German wine) goes better with the pork dishes.

As for the beers, the list changes every so often, but I'm a hef fan (with a squeeze of lemon!) and they have plenty of draft options (and bottles).

The whole restaurant will cheer you on to finish the boot. \nThe service is as good as it gets, it's very very busy, you kinda have to try hard to get someone's attention but they're doing their best, and you have beer on your table, so try to be patient and have a good time. I've always had waiters/waitresses that are on top of their stuff when I go.\n\nNow the food. Everything is good. \nReibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus $11.00\nPotato Pancakes with Homemade Apple Sauce -- It's delicious. It's crispy and sweet. It's perfect as a desert in my opinion. \n\nMaultaschen in Pilzrahmso\u00dfe $11.50\nGerman Ravioli filled with Pork and Vegetables served with Mushroom Sauce -- How can you look at this and not want to get it? It's creamy and yummy. \n\nWiener Schnitzel vom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln und Gr\u00fcnem Salat $18.00\nBreaded and Sauteed Porkloin with Roasted Potatoes & Green Salad -- It's bready, thin, but delicious. \n\nJ\u00e4gerschnitzel in Champignonso\u00dfe mit Sp\u00e4tzle und gr\u00fcnem Salat $18.50\nSauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Sp\u00e4tzle & Green Salad -- This is really really tender and the mushroom sauce is amazing. I wish I could buy it in a jar. \n\nKassler vom Grill mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei $16.50\nGrilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes -- Nice thick pork chop, they know how to cook their pork. \n\nGegrillte N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei $14.50\nGrilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes -- huge pork sausages, good for group sharing.\n\nFalscher Hase mit Zwiebelso\u00dfe und Kartoffelbrei $14.50\nMeatloaf with Bacon and Egg served with Onion Sauce & Mashed Potatoes -- Only the best meatloaf ever. \n\nMy advice is, get a few dishes to share amongst the group, because you will want to try everything. It's good hearty food. \n\nGirls who don't like the bitter beer taste, they have fruity beers. The framboise is my favorite. It's sweet and tangy.

Sidenote: even better as leftovers!\nIvanne T. had one of the specials which was a breaded pork cutlet, sauerkraut, and a potato dumpling. Her's was good but I liked mine better. I'm a sauce person and my braised beef had a large portion of a very tasty brown sauce.\nWe also had the Potato Pancakes which were of course quite scrumptious. Fried potato goodness with applesauce, how can you go wrong?\n\nNow for the beer. The variety of German beers is great, and from what Ivanne T. told me, also pretty authentic. I'm not normally a dark beer drinker, in fact, I usually stick to what I know, which is Blue Moon and different Hefeweizen. But upon entering the restaurant (late, as is usually my style), Ivanne, who had been waiting at the bar area, offered me a sip of her dark beer - K\u00f6stritzer Schwarzbier.\nThoughts in my head: *sip* \"There's no way that could be a dark beer, that was delicious! It had hints of caramel and molasses, and wait was that a chocolate hint too? I need another sip.\" *sip* \"Forget the food, I know what beer I'm ordering!\"\nReal life: I'll have one of these! *Points to pint in hand* (again, I don't bother with the German, it's not like anyone will understand me anyway)\n\nMaybe it's the German side coming out in me (oh yes, I have a streak of German in me, it's true), but I didn't even have a need for water at dinner. Haha, maybe I shouldn't be admitting this, but my Schwarzbier was a wonderful accompaniment to the tasty and very salty German treats that comprised my dinner.\n\nBeer enthusiasts, I highly recommend this place for you! \n\nNote: Street parking is horrible on any night, so give yourself extra time. If you're heading to the Opera House after dinner for a show, and don't mind paying, I suggest parking in the $10 lot across the street from the Performing Arts Garage (on the corner of Gough and Grove).", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Potato pancakes were delicious and the spaetzle was awesome!

I really wanted Das Boot but with such a great beer selection, I couldn't settle on one.  \n\nFor dinner, we got the Wiener Schnitzel and grilled pork and bratwurst (I believe it was on their special menu).

They also provide a small plate of lettuce that looked really plain.  However, the dressing made this \"salad\" delicious.  I love the sour dressing they used.

And yeah, I will be back.\n\nFull disclosure: I don't like beer. \n\nGo ahead, jump to the next review, its not like there aren't enough or everything has been said before. But with that said, this place rocks. I mean two-liter glass boots of beer!?! Are you kidding me!?! That is pretty f***king awesome.  It may not be my drink of choice, but I can respect the boot of beer. Oh, and it comes in \"glasses\" up to 5 liters. Someday, I will come back with the rowdiest group I can muster and order like multiple 5 liters. Epic.\n\nAnd a rowdy group of old college buddies/bay-to-breakers teammates seems to be the ideal company for this place. With the comunal tables, and walls that absorb exactly zero sound decimals, Suppenk\u00fcche basically is designed for a guys night out. Except, for some reason it that wasn't when I went.\n\nDid we come at a weird time? I'm not sure, but whatever happened the place was full of families and little children. Ugh. Nothing ruins an atmosphere for me more that a crying baby or toddler throwing a sh*t fit when I just want to have a nice evening. Minus one star.\n\nBut back to the beer. the selection is great. I obviously didn't get to try all of them, but from what I did get, (and sampling from friends' beer at my table), its top notch. Good beer + kick ass sizes = two stars. \n\nAs for the food. I wish I can say it was all amazing, but it seemed more hit and miss. We ordered the potato pancakes since Yelpers have raved about 'em. Not too impressed. They seemed over-cooked to me. \n\nTo be fair, my meal was a win. I ordered the Grilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes. Perfect. The only critique I can find is with the mashed potatoes. I was raised in Idaho so I know a thing or two about 'em. While they are very good, I've had richer, creamier ones back home. \n\nThe other downside was the Wiener Schnitzel I tried. Again, it didn't blow me away. Maybe I needed more beer in me, but they seemed dry. \n\nFinally, kudos to the apple strudel. While some people at the table were disappointed that it wasn't \"traditional\" enough. I didn't really care b/c its amazing. Like I could have ordered another one amazing. \n\nSo, to sum it up, I'd give my experience 3 stars.

What a surprise that on a Sunday evening around 6:00 pm that it was so busy!  Clearly this is a popular spot with the neighborhood.  We waited about 35 minutes for a seat which wasn't too bad considering the great selection beer they had as well as the affable bartender.\n\nSince it was just two of us, we were seated at a table with 4 others.

I am a girl and I have a small bladder--the boot is 2 liters of beer.  There was no way I could have finished it.  I wanted to save room for the delicious food.  Everything that came out of the kitchen looked sooo good!  In our 1.5 hour wait, which actually turned out to be less than that, we decided on what dishes we wanted. We ordered potato pancakes at the bar, and within 5 minutes, it came out! Talk about quick service!!  Before we even finished our appetizer, our name was called for our table.  \n\nIt is interesting how they seat you with random people, but again... do as the Germans do!  We ordered the venison medallions, the holiday goose special, and the breaded red snapper to share as family style.  Since everyone raves about the spatzle, we all got sides of that.  The spatzle was just OK... nothing special.  It just tasted like pasta with no sauce.  Aside from the plain spatzle, all of our dishes were delicious!  The goose was interesting in that the texture was like pork, but had a poultry-like taste. The mushroom sauce that came with it was delicious.  The venison also had a good sauce, and was cooked nicely.  It was similar to eating steak and didn't taste too gamey.  The red snapper didn't taste \"german\".. it was a pretty typical giantic piece breaded fish that came with pickled tomato and cucumber salad.  The tomato cucumber salad was definitely the favorite of the night! \n\nOverall, the food is pretty good and comes in big portions--enough to share! The service wasn't too bad either.  The food came out pretty quickly for how packed the place was.\n\nWhat I really liked about this place aside from the food, was that this restaurant has got to have the most lively and spirited crowd... when it's someone's birthday here, everyone in the restaurant joins in on the celebration and pounds on the table.  It happened probably 5 times since I was in the restaurant either waiting for my table or eating my food.  I feel bad for the neighbors upstairs!

On the one hand, the food is delicious.  On the other hand, everything else about this place sucks.  Allow me to elaborate.\n\nWent here tonight with my girlfriend because we love German food.  We were seated relatively quickly, considering how crowded it was, which was a nice start.  The first thing I noticed, however, was that this place was LOUD.  Like, seriously the loudest restaurant I've ever been in.  And on a Monday night, no less.  They need to put some carpet down or some wallpaper or something to muffle the sound.... it's really, really bad.  The whole night I had to lean in and shout every time I wanted to say something, like I was at a bar.  Except I wasn't, I was at a restaurant.\n\nWe got two appetizers: the potato pancakes and the fried cheese balls.  The pancakes were delicious... basically little hash brown patties with some really tasty applesauce to spread on them.  The cheese balls were kind of gross.  They came out cold and were served with this cranberry sauce that tasted more like wine than cranberries.  So one good app and one bad; those even out.\n\nFor our entries, we got a bratwurst with sauerkraut and roasted potatoes and the bacon and egg meatloaf, which came with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The bratwurst was very tasty (although my girlfriend bit down on something that seemed like a piece of bone and almost chipped a tooth) but the roasted potatoes were meh.  The meatloaf, however, was really really good.  It came with a hard-boiled egg in the middle of it, which was a really nice touch.  The mashed potatoes on the side were quite good as well - certainly better than the roasted potatoes with the brat (which I was surprised by).\n\nI haven't even mentioned our service.  The service was downright abysmal.  We had some blonde amazon who was either the busiest a server has ever been or decided to dismiss us after we didn't order any alcohol.  The group next to us got their appetizers a good 10 minutes before we did, even though we ordered ours 3-4 minutes before them (and they got the exact same appetizer we did).  Our entrees took forever as well, which is fine, but once she brought them out, we pretty much didn't see her again.  One drink refill before the entrees came out, but none after.  We had to flag down a different server to get us a to-go box and to notify our server to bring us the check.  Of course, when we got the check, it had 3 items from the group next to us on it.  She fixed it after we pointed it out.... that is, after waiting 5 more minutes for her to come back to pick up our credit card.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- Food ranging from good to very good.\n- Horrible service.\n- Bad atmosphere due to how loud it is.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-08-24"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the potato soup, braised beef with sp\u00e4tzle, and a chicken special with dumplings and potato pancakes.

I'm told it's always like this.\n\nWe had attempted to make a reservation about 2 days in advance for 8:30, but they were already booked up. On a Friday night, I wasn't surprised, so this was our bad. However, they said as long as someone gets there around 7 to put our name in then we should definitely be seated by 8:30. My thoughtful girlfriend took it upon herself to be there at 7 while the rest of us were getting off work and making our way there. She had put a reservation in for a table of 6, but by the time I arrived around 7:45, we needed to add another 2 to the reservation, now totaling 8 in our party. We were told at first that 6 was the max they could seat, but once our table became ready the waiter told us that we could squeeze the other 2 in at our table. This was a relief because I was starting to think our last-minute additions to the party were going to have to wait for a separate table of their own. We fit comfortably at a table that had a booth on one side.\n\nI drank a lot of beer that night so the details are kind of fuzzy. I do remember everyone in my group loving the food and the beer, though. I ordered the Pilsener, which was excellent. The whole table shared a communal boot filled with a light Belgian ale. Next time I'd like to get the light Hefeweizen.

An hour and a half wait, ouch!\n\nFood (4): Food was similar to Schmidt's; lots of carbs and some protein. The mashed potatoes were solid and are a perfect vehicle for the sauce that accompanies the protein. In my case I had the meatloaf wrapped in bacon and with egg. The egg was not a plus, but the bacon took it to another level. My girlfriend had the pork sausage which was awesome, but I was surprised they didn't have more sausage selections like Schmidt's. Blutwurst, anyone? A buddy had the venison and he complained it was too well done.

Since I opted to celebrate my bday one week late during 4th of July weekend in the City, it wasn't as crowded as it probably is on a \"regular Friday night.\"  But don't get me wrong, it was still crowded.\n\nAnyway, to the food.  My gracious friends ordered the German ravioli and potato pancakes for apps (and probably to appease the anxious wait staff while my tardy friends were waiting to make their entrance).  I enjoyed both dishes tremendously.  The potato pancakes had the best consistency - crispy on the outside and deliciously starchy on the inside, just like the perfect hash brown.  And the german ravioli tasted like a dumpling to me, but it was still very good.  I ordered the beef with red cabbage and schnitzel.  It was a LOT OF FOOD.  Or maybe it was a lot of beer?

So, the Saleslady and myself put our soggy brains together to find a quick meal. Most people would think the scallops, oysters and cheese would have been enough, but we need something hearty, savory. We needed some CARNE.  Ahhh Suppenkuche...thank you for your meat and potatoes.\n\nWe roll into  the wooden door on the corner of the building and are told that we could share a table with another party if we didn't mind. Belligerence was eminent if we didn't eat something of substance soon so we sat with a group of wonderful Latin ladies right next to the bar.\n\nThis place has an awesome selection of beers if you are into good beer. My absolute favorite is a German Triple Bock call Aventinus. A sweet rich wheat beer from Germany that packs 8-9% golden elixir in it.\n\nFirst thing is first we get a couple of cold beers and check the menu. The Saleslady starts chatting up the Latin ladies and we soon find out that one is the owner's wife and one is her Mommy. This is good.  The owner comes over and chats with us for a sec and I tell him how I had my graduation dinner here blah blah blah. Don't quite remember if he sent us a beer or not.\n\nSo, we order the Bratwurst which comes with potato pancake and sauerkraut. The Brat is salty and got hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. With a dollop of the whole seed mustard each bite is fantastic. The gooey in the middle crunchy on the outside potato pancakes are perfectly salty.  I've had these at other restaurants, but none compare to those made here. Sauerkraut is really not one of my fav things to eat, so no comment on it, but I hear its good.\n\nSo the with FULL bellies and alcohol coursing through our veins we venture in to the streets of Hayes valley.  I can't really remember if we went out after wards or not, but I know we had a memorable food tour.\n\nService is quick the scene is loud at this casual restaurant with wood table and wood benches.

The wall and ceiling decor is something else, though, and has to be experienced for yourself.\n\nEvery time I've been to Suppenk\u00fcche, it's been busy, even on a Monday night. Keep that in mind if you are aiming to bring your posse for some Weihenstephaner Hefeweissebier and schnitzel. There's a little alcove off the bar area that can be handy for 2-3 people to eat in or just wait for a table while drinking some Korbinian.\n\nThe beer menu covers all the German styles, from Hefeweizen to M\u00e4rzen to bocks (with the exception of, perhaps, Roggenbier, but then that one is pretty rare). Last time I had a good H\u00f6fbrau Helles and my dining companion, Melanie N., opted for Mahr's Weiss Bock, which was delicious, if a bit yeasty. As much as I enjoy German beer, I can't necessarily say the same about German food. I mean, most of it is meat and potatoes and cabbage - or sp\u00e4tzle, I guess - in various permutations. Great, if that's what you're after, and perhaps my experience is limited, but I haven't had any adventurous or fusion styles in German restaurants here. Suppenk\u00fcche doesn't help in that regard. While its standbys like schnitzel (both pork and veal) are decent, the potato pancakes we got last time were terribly overfried, for example.

It could be a hit or miss.\nI've personally dined here several times.  Some were great experience, and some were terrible.\n\nThe definite pros:\nCHEAP BEER. (I think they only have german selections)  \nDelicious beer cocktails.\nYummy appetizers.\n\nThe definite cons:\nYou can't make a reservation unless you have a party of 6 or more.\nSmall dining area, which translates to ridiculous wait time if you go on a crowded night.\nThere are almost no small tables.  You'll be forced to share a table with another party if you have 2 or 3 people.  A definite problem if you would like some privacy with your date.\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nUpon walking in, you're greeted with a rather run-down decor and dim lighting.  Along with the beige wood table, they convey the atmosphere of a cottage.   This place is probably better for a group night out rather than a romantic dinner.\n\nWell, my last experience at Suppenkuche was so bad that it forced me to create a yelp account and write a review.\n\n1. The Service.\nI love the potato pancakes with apple sauce and that's the one thing I keep going back there for.  Unfortunately, my friend wasn't that hungry that night so we decided to just order entrees.   However, I had a change of heart and told the waitor I would still like to get the appetizer regardless.  The waitor then questioned me, \"Are you sure you want the appetizer?  The meal portion is rather huge!  The couple sitting across from you only shared an appetizer and an entree and they are stuffed.\"  To which I reply, \"Yes.  I'm a big eater.\"  He said that he thought it was going to be too much for us.  I had to reiterate my choice before he went away unwillingly to put our order in.   I do not understand why I almost had to argue to get my food.  Even more ridiculous was that the waitor came back after he put the order in and said \"don't blame me if you guys explode later.\"    Okay, seriously, was that necesary?\n\nOh, another waitor took my beer glass away without even bothering to ask me if I would like another beer after I finished my first glass.  (which I was going to say \"yes, of course\")\n\nDuring the whole course of meal, our waitor didn't bother to come back to our table and asked if we needed anything (some water would have been nice). \n\nWhen we finished our meal (by the way, we cleaned the plates - not because it was great, but because we were hungry), we asked for the check, and he then sat down by the table next to us and started talking to another couple for at least 5 minutes, none of which was meal related - just plain chit-chat, before he went to the cashier and gave us the check.  \n\nUnacceptable.\n\n\n2.  The Food.\nDon't be fooled by the name of restaurant.  This place offers very limited selection of soup.\n\nI took a look at the special menu, and decided I would break the norm and try the cornish game hen with stuffed bread dumpling.   \n\nit was an utter disaster.  The chicken lacked flavor and was extremely dry.  The stuffing was also extremely sticky and dry, which made it really hard to swallow.  The vegetables served on the side tasted rather bitter to my liking. I'm not sure if I just got an overcooked hen or that's how they normally serve it.  I'd definitely recommend you not to get this dish.\n\nWith all these negative things said, I did have pleasant experience from this place before.\n\nAs I mentioned, the potato pancakes with apple sauce is to DIE FOR.\n(A bit on the greasy side, but I am a big sucker for fried food)\nSauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Spatzle and Green Salad is a rather enjoyable plate.  It doesn't look fancy, but it tastes great like a good home-made dinner.\n\n\n\nOh, they don't speak a word of German, so don't bother trying to order in German like my friend did.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["The next best thing has to be the potato pancakes.

Lets just say, our intent was to have a few beers here and then head over to a nearby restaurant for dinner, but alas, it was not meant to be.  \n\nAs you walk in, the atmosphere at this restaurant is really warm and welcoming and I felt like every corner and table was filled with groups of friends having a great time.  The communal tables definitely promote this vibe, because our table of six was there for so long, we had two sets of couples rotate through in sharing our table with us and we had a few good laughs with each couple, of course being that we were getting louder and louder as the night progressed, we had a few more laughs with the second couple...or were they laughing AT us...no matter, providing entertainment to others is not a bad thing.  \n\nOnto the beers...I'm not going to lie, I know nothing about German beers, so yes, I looked up wikipedia to learn a little bit more before coming here.  (you are now thinking, \"who does that??\", I do yes, so get over it).  So I was armed with fresh knowledge about lagers, ales, and further about pilsners, helles, bocks....but when I looked at the menu, my sights were set on the helles with lemon soda...this was sweet and delicious!    My next choice was the black cherry lambic which was a fruity delight and I couldn't wait to order another (also comes in rasberry)  So what if it looked and tasted like snapple, I happen to enjoy snapple! The choices I selected were not followed by the boys, but their selections were just as good, especially the winter lager which was one of the specials that night.  We ended the night with taking shots of the 80% proof herbal concoction that came in tiny little bottles and tasted like a mixture of hennessy and jager.  Whoa did that burn. Apparently suppose to make you \"bright and alert\" and funny enough, I think it did!  \n\nBefore you think we spent four hrs of just drinking, let me assure you that I'm way too much of a lightweight for THAT type of night.

Potato pancakes with apple sauce (large crispy golden cakes with a translucent and soft center because they make these with raw potatoes instead of frying them with fully cooked potatoes)\n2. Grilled pork sausage (crispy on the outside, really delicious, especially with a little bit of mustard and sauerkraut)\n3. Braised beef (this was flavorful, but a bit on the tough side)\n4. Veal weinersnitzel (really, anything fried to a crisp without being oily is generally good in my book)\n5. Meatloaf (scrumptious and moist, with bits of bacon scattered throughout).  \n6. Blackforest cake (uhh...yeah, make that two, thanks)\n\nAll in all, the food was hefty, with lots of starch on the plate and an appropriate companion to the beers.

(Imagine 3 long skinny fingers.) The texture wasn't as fine as I'd expected but they were still plenty flavourful. Perfect for pairing with their fantastic sauerkraut!\n\n*WEI\u00dfWURST - WHITE VEAL & PORK SAUSAGES IN BUTTER BROTH WITH PRETZEL (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=4d9SHiKni5ikl1HJ7NUljw): My favourite of the sausages. (And great with kraut!) The white sausages were plump and moist with a really fine texture. Milder in flavour than the bratwurst but the texture totally won me over. Very comforting--like the congee of sausages. I also enjoyed the way the casing \"popped\" as I cut into it. The pretzel was also very good but the butter broth was way too salty to actually drink.\n\n*20CM FRANKFURTER SAUSAGE: Ordered as a side, this didn't look quite as impressive since they cut it into two 10cm-long sausages. It was tasty, but nothing all that special. (Unless, of course, you eat it with the sauerkraut!)\n\n*BAVARIAN MEATLOAF WITH EGGS & ROASTED POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=Ju7PE1kvIRdFdPqU3xqdYg): Not quite a sausage but still a processed meat item. The meatloaf reminded me of spam (which I love) but more refined and with a finer texture. It had some bounce to it and tasted great with the sunny side eggs and sauerkraut. The roasted potatoes were pretty yummy too.\n\n*GERMAN RAVIOLI SCRAMBLED WITH EGGS & ONIONS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=We8wHUPgVxvWx0RiPFEmwQ): A very hearty and flavourful egg scramble with cut up pieces of ravioli and slivered onions mixed in. I loved it, especially topped with some kraut. The light and refreshing cucumber salad provided a nice balance too.\n\n*EMPEROR'S PANCAKE WITH BRANDIED RAISINS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=sCSMFRwBiRPiplCadbuuOQ): This comprised of cut up pancake pieces loaded with raisins and dusted with powdered sugar. The pancake was of a thinner variety but still very moist. The raisins added sweetness and the apple sauce was the perfect accompaniment.\n\n*APPLE STRUDEL WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=-GG_djHCUlxStRWDVEVILA): This would've been a lot better if the strudel was warmed and the crust was crispy.

Woo hoo!  12 people on a friday night in SF, I dare you to find something reasonable that isn't a chain or Chinese.  \n\nMy reservation was for 6:00.  I get a text from RBL at 6:03, \"if everyone isn't here by 6:15, they will give our table away.\"  We ran.  \nIt was pretty busy when we first walked in.  I was a bit overwhelmed.  It's smaller inside than I expected and the restaurant was already bustling with big groups everywhere. I didn't recognize anyone in there.  I started to get nervous.  Silly me, the hostess walked us to the back room where I saw RBL and two of my other friends.   \n\nWe really lucked out with a terrific waitress who was super cool and understanding.  The hostess came back every so often to check in on us and fortunately for me, most of my friends showed up within ten minutes of my arrival (with the exception of one, Ms. Mare).  I honestly think that timing is everything.  Since I opted to celebrate my bday one week late during 4th of July weekend in the City, it wasn't as crowded as it probably is on a \"regular Friday night.\"  But don't get me wrong, it was still crowded.\n\nAnyway, to the food.

We had the German mixed salad, which was an absolutely delicious amalgamation of potato salad and a bunch of different pickled vegetable salads including carrot, cabbage (like cole slaw), red cabbage, and beets. This was a fantastic dish that was fresh, savory, colorful, and diverse. We also got the pickled herring salad, which contained many of the components of the mixed salad, with, of course, the addition of pickled herring dressed in a creamy sauce.

Trout was cooked perfectly, wasn't too dry. My friend said pork was delicious too. We wanted to try the dessert as well, but we were really full. \nDefinitely one of the fav SF restaurants now! The atmosphere and the food is amazing. I could just eat that herring everyday and be happy!

As for the beers, the list changes every so often, but I'm a hef fan (with a squeeze of lemon!) and they have plenty of draft options (and bottles).  For the most authentic experience, you have to try your beer out of a boot.

The downside, as a few people have mentioned, is the sound.  So.  Loud.  We were sharing our table with a large party of young folk who were kind of on the brink of screaming and, while I appreciate that's part of the fun of a German ale house, it just got a little old.  It also didn't matter quite so much because it's hard to talk when you're fervently stuffing everything within proximity into your gaping maw.  It's also not so hot if you're trying to keep healthy.  Sure, you can get the healthy veggie option - but then you're not really doing it up right, are you?  And this coming from someone who's really rather paranoid about such things.  Am I a couple pounds heavier now?  Absolutely.  Have I probably lost a bit of hearing I'll never get back?  Sure.  Would I go again?  Eh, I'd maybe make it an annual tradition.

A definite problem if you would like some privacy with your date.\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nUpon walking in, you're greeted with a rather run-down decor and dim lighting.  Along with the beige wood table, they convey the atmosphere of a cottage.   This place is probably better for a group night out rather than a romantic dinner.\n\nWell, my last experience at Suppenkuche was so bad that it forced me to create a yelp account and write a review.\n\n1. The Service.\nI love the potato pancakes with apple sauce and that's the one thing I keep going back there for.  Unfortunately, my friend wasn't that hungry that night so we decided to just order entrees.   However, I had a change of heart and told the waitor I would still like to get the appetizer regardless.  The waitor then questioned me, \"Are you sure you want the appetizer?  The meal portion is rather huge!  The couple sitting across from you only shared an appetizer and an entree and they are stuffed.\"  To which I reply, \"Yes.  I'm a big eater.\"  He said that he thought it was going to be too much for us.  I had to reiterate my choice before he went away unwillingly to put our order in.   I do not understand why I almost had to argue to get my food.  Even more ridiculous was that the waitor came back after he put the order in and said \"don't blame me if you guys explode later.\"    Okay, seriously, was that necesary?\n\nOh, another waitor took my beer glass away without even bothering to ask me if I would like another beer after I finished my first glass.  (which I was going to say \"yes, of course\")\n\nDuring the whole course of meal, our waitor didn't bother to come back to our table and asked if we needed anything (some water would have been nice). \n\nWhen we finished our meal (by the way, we cleaned the plates - not because it was great, but because we were hungry), we asked for the check, and he then sat down by the table next to us and started talking to another couple for at least 5 minutes, none of which was meal related - just plain chit-chat, before he went to the cashier and gave us the check.  \n\nUnacceptable.\n\n\n2.  The Food.\nDon't be fooled by the name of restaurant.  This place offers very limited selection of soup.\n\nI took a look at the special menu, and decided I would break the norm and try the cornish game hen with stuffed bread dumpling.   \n\nit was an utter disaster.  The chicken lacked flavor and was extremely dry.  The stuffing was also extremely sticky and dry, which made it really hard to swallow.  The vegetables served on the side tasted rather bitter to my liking. I'm not sure if I just got an overcooked hen or that's how they normally serve it.  I'd definitely recommend you not to get this dish.\n\nWith all these negative things said, I did have pleasant experience from this place before.\n\nAs I mentioned, the potato pancakes with apple sauce is to DIE FOR.\n(A bit on the greasy side, but I am a big sucker for fried food)\nSauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Spatzle and Green Salad is a rather enjoyable plate.

I came in here shortly after 11am because I know finding parking in this district can be a pain during rush hours. Street parking here. The exterior of the restaurant isn't eye catching, but once you're inside, it has a nice feel to it whether it be the customers, the servers, or the overall atmosphere. If by chance there are not enough tables to accommodate your group (the smaller the better), they offer the option to seat you with a party at another table. Some seating may be a bit tight, but it works. Service is very friendly; they always check in on you to see how you are and how you like the food, which is super kind of them.\n\nHere's a Tip: If you aren't too familiar with German cuisine or German food in general, I advise you to look at Yelp photos for references since the menus are all text. I'm a picture menu guy, so I'd rather know what the food looks like before I order it.\n\nGot the Potato Pancakes, Grilled Pork Sausage w/ Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes, & Chicken Schnitzel.

Their menu is pretty simple as they offer different platters with a main meat dish (or fish, if you don't eat meat) with a side of mashed potatoes or a salad. I chose their classic grilled pork sausage with sauerkraut & mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got their porkloin in mushroom sauce with Spatzle and green salad. We couldn't even finish our meal but my goodness this place is one of my favorite spots for German food. As for the beers, they offer a wide variety of German style beers with a wide palette of flavor notes and from hefs to a dark lager.

One order comes with three and I could probably eat them all.

The communal tables definitely promote this vibe, because our table of six was there for so long, we had two sets of couples rotate through in sharing our table with us and we had a few good laughs with each couple, of course being that we were getting louder and louder as the night progressed, we had a few more laughs with the second couple...or were they laughing AT us...no matter, providing entertainment to others is not a bad thing.  \n\nOnto the beers...I'm not going to lie, I know nothing about German beers, so yes, I looked up wikipedia to learn a little bit more before coming here.  (you are now thinking, \"who does that??\", I do yes, so get over it).  So I was armed with fresh knowledge about lagers, ales, and further about pilsners, helles, bocks....but when I looked at the menu, my sights were set on the helles with lemon soda...this was sweet and delicious!    My next choice was the black cherry lambic which was a fruity delight and I couldn't wait to order another (also comes in rasberry)  So what if it looked and tasted like snapple, I happen to enjoy snapple! The choices I selected were not followed by the boys, but their selections were just as good, especially the winter lager which was one of the specials that night.  We ended the night with taking shots of the 80% proof herbal concoction that came in tiny little bottles and tasted like a mixture of hennessy and jager.  Whoa did that burn.

Unfortunately, I would rather eat a medium-rare rib-eye steak. :( The red cabbage that accompanied the dish was too sour for my liking. The fluffy pillows of chewy Sp\u00e4tzle on the other hand, were a splendid side for the venison. Similar to the texture of gnocchi, the Sp\u00e4tzle, was doughy and light. You could say that the Sp\u00e4tzle was an upgraded version of macaroni. The dish also came with extra red wine plum sauce, that I did not pour onto my venison, as the existing amount of sauce on the venison was sufficient. \n\nTHE TROUT\n\nThee underdog of all entrees served here, as most patrons overlook this one. Mmm those luscious Bouillon Potatoes though. The creamy and buttery potatoes reminded me of a slightly firmer mash potato side. I guess I got too excited about them potatoes though, because I almost forgot to commend the exquisitely moist trout. The skin of the fish was notably crisp and provided additional flavor. Squeeze the lemon all over the trout for a slightly fresher, livelier taste. \n\nWo finde ich die Toiletten?: Where can I find the toilet?\n\nThe result?

The restaurant gets very crowded. Dinner is served from 5-10 daily and my advice is: Get there early! The restaurant gets very noisy and boisterous, so come in good spirits! This is not the place for intimate conversation.\n\nMy favorite dishes are obviously the Schnitzel and Spatzel. The Jagershnitzel is my recommendation as it comes with a mushroom sauce over the breaded pork and without the sauce, the Schnitzel can be a bit dry for some. The Sauteed Trout in Lemon Butter Sauce is also one of my favorites when I'm not in the mood for pork.\n\nSuppenkuche only takes reservations for 6 people or more and usually there is street parking available nearby. \n\nHope you try this delicious restaurant!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-11-03"}], "cheese sp\u00e4tzle in onion butter sauce": [{"excerpts": ["For the main course, we had the vegetarian courses; Cheese Sp\u00e4tzle in Onion Butter Sauce served with a small Mixed Salad and Portobello Mushroom stuffed with Spinach & Feta Cheese over Pepper Sauce.

German's are hot :)  I'm a big fan of the German's and their Cheese Sp\u00e4tzle!\n\nI've wanted to go to Suppenkuche for about a year and I finally had the chance to do so.  I thought it was a bit weird to be seated with strangers -when you come here, don't expect to get your own private table like at normal restaurants.  \n\nThe two of us came here on Saturday just when they opened, around 5:30pm, and were seated immediately.  It gets pretty crowded here!\n\nWe started off with the Linsensuppe (Lentil Soup) and that was tasty.  It was my first time having lentils and I thought it was pretty good. For the main course, we had the vegetarian courses; Cheese Sp\u00e4tzle in Onion Butter Sauce served with a small Mixed Salad and Portobello Mushroom stuffed with Spinach & Feta Cheese over Pepper Sauce.  Our entrees came with sides, such as sauerkraut, beets, etc. \n\nI was in love with the Cheese Sp\u00e4tzle!  It was creamy, rich, and cheesey!  It was a bit heavy on the onions but I didn't mind.  If you're not an onion fan, I wouldn't recommend this at all.  There really was nothing bad about the spatzle -the noodles were cooked perfectly and the texture was just right. \n\nI tried the Portobello Mushroom stuffed with Spinach and Feta and I wasn't a big fan of that.  I don't think the flavors matched nicely -I'm not a big feta cheese fan so perhaps that is why.  \n\nOverall, I'd totally go back here for the Cheese Sp\u00e4tzle and the beer :)", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-08-09"}, {"excerpts": ["All of the other dishes i tasted were really good to, the cheese sp\u00e4tzle in onion butter sauce was so rich, creamy and delicious mmmmmm ;) ", "of course any meal is more enjoyable with great beer, especially when it comes in a huge boot haha.

Of what i tasted nothing was less then awesome.. for a main course i ordered the sauteed pork loin (j\u00e4gerschnitzel) in mushroom sauce with sp\u00e4tzle and i was downright sad when there was no more room in my stomach for another bite. As an appetizer we shared the potato pancakes with homemade apple sauce which was fabulous! All of the other dishes i tasted were really good to, the cheese sp\u00e4tzle in onion butter sauce was so rich, creamy and delicious mmmmmm ;) of course any meal is more enjoyable with great beer, especially when it comes in a huge boot haha. Beware the wait is a little long but quite worth it in my opinion. \n\nOther then the food i loved the decor and vibe here. the service is very friendly and helpful in picking dishes as well as your beer. When i walked in i felt that someone had invited me and all of their friends into their home for a feast, with picnic bench style seating and a homey decor i really enjoyed every minute.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-08-04"}]}
