"], "author": "Rho-p O.", "review": "Having worked customer service jobs before, I know very well the stress and frenzy an employee can be, will be, subjected to. And at times, I've known too the pay-off... although... and let's be honest here, it is often thankless, and the pay itself does not seem to justify one's efforts.\n\nI know it with with my great tap root.\n\nAnd I know too that very often the thankless-ness does not come from the employers, but the customers! It is a great economic injustice that they tend to dictate if an establishment should succeed or fail. I am not one for passivity, or for clich\u00e9s, but this couldn't have come any more serviceable than now: that tired, old, neo-Stoical stance of \"It is what it is\". In business, especially in small business, if you are to succeed, you rely heavily on your customers, and your customer service.\n\nAnd having been a customer myself-- longer than I've been in customer service jobs-- I know what makes bad service and good.\n\nI used to be a fan of this place, and can't seem to stop singing its praises to my fellow \"drunkards, insomniacs and fl\u00e2neurs\" desperate for grub in the middle of the night. Back when I lived in the South of Market, they would, quite literally be very happy to deliver to me even at the eleventh hour: at two-thirty, two-fourty-five in the morning. The delivery fast and replete with smiles and pleasantries. I'm thinking they were new-ish then when first I wrote them a glaring review (there were, to my recollection, only three or four other reviews here on Yelp), and were excited to get a place up and running. I was more excited when I found an apartment a block away from them on Lower Nob Hill, and you better believe that there came a period when I just couldn't stay away. I'm still rather new to the neighborhood, and being a homebody, if I can help it, keep the weekend evenings all to myself, relaxing, although I've since grown quite aware that I've moved smack dab at the center of the hub of things. Well, that is to say if you feel yourself comfortable, at home, or one of the AAU plebs, or the raucous \"bridge-and-tunnel\" people. Needless to say these rats constitute the majority of their customers, especially during the weekends. I've been witness to the pandemonium several times, an obstreperous line out the door. In one such episode, the business was so frenzied that when I got to the counter for my phoned-in order, they had forgotten that I had placed an order for two items, but completed my transaction for only one. Not until I was turning around did they notice, and after some manic hand gestures from one of the cashier's co-workers, perhaps alerting him of his negligence, I had already exhausted my patience to fall back into that line. Whatever. No big deal. The Shawarma Sandwich was still good. Never mind those soggy onion rings, indeed my dinner was complete even without them.\n\nI had mentioned in my last review the difficulty in placing orders (delivery or otherwise) over the phone. I may have mentioned too that part of that difficulty is, shall we say, with the, let's call it their 'cultured voices.' But the greater difficulty is the noise from within their confines: all that hollering amongst each other and amongst the customers. That's why I prefer ordering online. When came the time that I did, and arrived to pick up my order, they haven't made it at all! I expected an apology,-- as customary response, like I said, I've done customer service jobs before, and apologies are rarely meant, although the gesture is appeasing-- instead I got a nice scolding from the cashier, telling me that in future ordering over the phone would be best for them! But oh well... The Spaghetti Bolognese wasn't half bad.\n\nIn time I've started noticing their competitors. And if one knew my neighborhood, one knew there's plenty of them around. It took a while before I thought of them again. And when finally I came around, last night, their delivery service online wasn't working (not much to their dismay, I'm sure!) and so I had no choice but to phone in. Well, it was the same hollering, clinging-and-clanging situation happening, muffled by 'cultured voices' and a fuzzy connection, was it too late to place an order for delivery, I asked. No, he said, only if I would be willing to be put on hold. I obliged. I heard the microphone set down the counter with the sharp thud of plastic on plastic. I overhear the madness carrying on as usual. Minutes go by, I wasn't counting, but it couldn't have been less than five. I heard the microphone scraped off the counter and picked up, and then one last click before silence. I kept my ear on that silence for a good few more minutes. In horror? No, but surely in absolute bafflement. Could it have been so busy that they quickly forgot that a customer on hold was trying to place an order? Could it be that business was that good they could afford to lose this customer? Well then, if so, I'd be happy to take mine elsewhere.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-10-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered their Alcatraz deal for pizza, but it was really lacking in toppings (more like sprinklings) and flavor.

Front desk gives us a couple of menus, 1 of which was this establishment. This place won due to its inclusion of shawarma and rotisserie chicken. I call and put in an order for 3 plates, 1 sandwich. I ask if I can pay with credit and he says they will bring credit machine wit them. I ask how long they expect it to take. Guy hangs up. We are starving and hungry, but whatever.\n\n35 minutes later I decide I should check on the order to confirm. They ask for the address.. Then to confirm the number is 409... I reply, no it's 449. They say 1249? I say no.. 4..4..9. I ask how long. They say driver has already left, so soon. I ask will he know what room.. He mumbles yes, I think.\n\nAnother 20 minutes passes and we get a call. The driver hasn't left yet and needs credit card info, as the other driver left with the credit card machine. I provide my card info and ask how long - \"it's busy tonight, it's taking 1 hour to get orders out. I'm leaving now so 15 minutes.\"\n\n15 minutes or so later, to his credit, I get another call. \"What room?\" 449 I reply. \"That's why it's late, I'm on 12th floor. I'll be down.\"\n\nI wait for him with door open, he says \"you don't have to be mad.\" I reply \"don't say it's late because I gave you the wrong room number.\" He starts to show me his scribble of 1249 on his notes.

Since they serve the two things I was looking for: an appetizer and a meat sampler, I decided to order delivery last Sunday, July 24th. I placed the order at 12:06pm an it arrived at 1:02pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Mixed Appetizer Platter: Combination plate of hummus, baba gannoush, tabouli, ezme, potato salad, eggplant salad ($14.99), Extra Pita (+$0.75)\n*Mixed Grill: Mixed grill consists of chicken and lamb shish kebob, kotte kebab, green salad, hummus ($18.99)\n\nThe baba ghanoush and tabbouleh were the best things about the meze platter. The tabouli added a nice green freshness to every bite and the baba gannoush was savory and creamy. The hummus, however, was very bland. Didn't have much flavor which was disappointing. Out of all the apps, I figured I'd like the hummus the best. The eggplant was all bad. I'm not sure how this is normally prepared, but it was slimy with a snotty texture. Really unappealing. I didn't try the potato salad and I didn't see any ezme, but I'm not familiar with ezme, so maybe it was there?\n\nAlso, the Eat24 app requires you to order extra pita with the mixed appetizer sampler. I believe this is a glitch as I realized later, the Eat24 site doesn't require you to do that. So save the extra $0.75 and go online to order as the pita was a little hard. I didn't even end up using on of the pitas I got anyways, so it was a waste. The mixed grill was a little better. All the meats had a nice smokiness. And surprisingly, I really liked the rice. The hummus with the mixed grill was also flavorless though.\n\nVery disappointing mezze platter. And the mixed grill was just okay.
