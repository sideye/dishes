The bacon and sausage were good salty, sweet and meaty, while the pancakes definitely were the highlight.

However, the server was extremely helpful and actually told us not to go get coffee up the street because there would be a table coming up shortly and if those who were not there while called, they would lose the spot.

Sometimes, you want to wake up and have some clean, fresh breakfast eggs and potatoes and you don't want to carry it around with you all day!\n\nI went here with a big group of 8 last weekend and considering how small plow is, they were quite happy and willing to accommodate us as soon as they could (which on a beautiful Sunday took about 20 minutes).\n\nThe food is delicious.  We tried almost everything.  The breakfast basket had a warm, savory corn millet muffin that melted in my mouth.  The jams were particularly tasty as well.  The orange scone and buttermilk thingy had just the right amount of sweetness - I hate overly sugary scones!\n\nWe also got quite a few salads - now somewhere in the review list a person was freaking out about rotten greens.  In my experience, we got EVERY kind of salad and there was NO ROTTEN greens.  The arugula had dressing on it, but it was fantastic and complemented the persimmons perfectly.\n\nOther highlights - the fried egg sandwich. It's huge, and when you bite into it, the yolk pours out.  Mmmmm.  The french toast and market omelette were fresh and tasty.  The housemade sausage patties were perfectly cooked.  And the pumpkin pancakes made me want to do a backflip.  Of course, our plow dish was filling and fun.  I love eating eggs, potatoes, and pancakes all in one!  And they're mini-pancakes so you're not overly stuffed.\n\nFinally, we got this pumpkin cheesecake at the end. Normally, I don't like cheesecake because it's too rich and sweet, but this one had cream and pumpkin spice that blended just right.  It was all, I'll say it again, delicious.\n\nMy final say is that if you're looking for a greasy spoon, this is not the place for you.  But if you're looking for a clean, fresh breakfast/brunch with top-of-the-line ingredients (they even list the farms/food places they get their ingredients from at the bottom of the menu), then go to plow!

With that being said, Plow is easily one of the few places in SF that is NOT worth the 1-2 hour wait, money or camera space.

This may be because the food is delicious. It is equally possible you know them only for their ridiculous wait times (a problem that has become emblematic of any metropolitan area with a love of basic, bougie, boozy brunch). \n\nBrief summary of why the food is great. Any Google search will yield that it is \"comfort\" and \"rustic style.\" What this means in practice is an almost southern amount of decadence with all of the artisanal perks of any bay area establishment. You have your all inclusive brunch platter called \"The Plow.\" But the menu also has chia seed pudding and a plate of gluten free, almond flour pancakes. \n\nMore on The Plow. It's probably the best option on the menu, especially for a first timer. Eggs are prepared to your liking, and you get the choice between pork sausage, chicken apple sausage, and bacon. However the main attractions are the potatoes (so popular they are named \"plow potatoes\"). These little guys are perfectly crispy on the outside but ultimately melt on your tongue. Anyone on a diet--please evacuate immediately. To add insult to carbaphobic injury, the lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. They are smaller than you'd expect, which is both a curse and a blessing.\n\nThe great food isn't the only reason this place is so busy. The interior of the restaurant is tiny, as if it is trying to spite you and your hungry stomach. There is ample outdoor seating for those who are waiting to be seated, but I'd also recommend exploring the surrounding area, or even walking all the way to the Mission, like one Yelper did. You will literally have enough time to walk several miles and back (if you can bear the hill, that is). Especially if you're trying to score brunch on a Sunday (but why would you do that to yourself). Alternatively, ordering a grapefruit mimosa is another good way to kill time.\n\nIf you plan on wandering--which I highly suggest--make sure you call them periodically or come back by the suggested time. When they invite people to come in, they do not call said people on the phone. If you aren't there, your spot is lost to the next people in line. I'm pretty sure they do this on purpose as a form of line management. Every time someone is called and doesn't show up, everyone waiting outside cheers.\n\nI only eat here once a year, because that's about how long it takes for me to no longer feel disenchanted by the wait time.

And fear-not you gluten free folks... they have the best almond flour pancakes I've ever tried... and I highly recommend them to wheat eaters as well. Moist... moist...moist. \n\nI ordered the soft egg scramble with goat cheese.. and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I'm an egg lover, and consider myself an egg connoisseur if you will.. so believe me when I say- this one's a winner.\n\nIf you're into rich breakfast, you will be taken care of here. I tend to stick with my egg dishes, but from what I've seen on other tables, it's not a dissapointment! \n\nForget the farm...go \"plow\" it up over here!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-05-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Seemed like a lot of folks dining around us were substituting in almond flour pancakes.

My friend had the plow while I had the dungeness crab scramble. The food here did not disappoint. The scramble was really good but it seemed to be a bit watery/mushy?

My friends and I came around 10:30am on a Saturday as a party of 5 and waited WAY OVER 2 hours. We were quoted 1.5 hours - 2 hours and called pretty frequently to check in on our table. \n\nThis is the part that irks me the most about my experience.. at one point maybe 1.5 hours in, they told us to come back in 15 minutes. We came back in around 10 minutes and they told us \"oh sorry, we just gave your table away\". Sorry, but WHAT???? You would think that a place this popular can figure out their reservations and their waiting system but NOPE. So if you come here, you better just wait right outside the restaurant....... They call your name once or twice and if you're not there they just skip right over you even if they tell you to come back at a certain time. Truly unlike anything else I've ever experienced before, but maybe I'm spoiled after being in Chicago and NY for a while now as they have their lines and reservation systems all figured out..\n\nService was good from one person, but rude from another. Honestly, at this point I was pretty hangry though. So maybe the service wasn't THAT bad, it just came across as horribly rude when we asked for more water and were ignored. Also the host just wasn't pleasant to my party at all. \n\nOrdered the Plow which comes with two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, plow potatoes, and your choice of house made pork sausage, Nueske's bacon, or chicken apple sausage. I got the chicken apple sauage which I really liked and the plow potatoes are SOOOO good. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also SOOOOOO good.

The food was good, but definitely not worth the two hour wait for a party of two. When we arrived, there were about 4-5 parties waiting outside; however, when I put my name down, I was told there was about 1.5 pages of parties ahead of us. We were told to expect a 45min to 1hr wait and decided to just wait outside. The host and hostess had called several parties without any response, so we thought it will probably be quick. After about 45 minutes of waiting and noticing that people arrived after us got seated first. Later, my husband went in and found out that, many of the parties showed up after they were called and placed back on the waitlist in their original orders; therefore, they were being seated before us. I have no problem waiting for good food, but I feel their system flawed. Usually you would have to go to the back of the line if you missed your name, but not at Plow. So, if you want to eat here, drop by and put your name down and return at the time convenient to you. \n\nAfter about 1.5hr wait, we were finally seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen area. Not only is their seating system flawed, their waitresses were not efficient either. We were seated for about 10-15 minutes until someone finally came to offer water and coffee, then we were told that she would come back to take our order even though we said we were ready to place our orders. While we were waiting again, we noticed that the kitchen had a lull, since no orders were being placed, and the person putting all the food orders together was looking at his phone. Once the orders started going in, we saw that he did not wash his hands before starting to handle all the food. In addition, while waiting for our waitress, we saw that the hostess went into the kitchen area, reached in the pile of bacon and grabbed one with her bare hands. She went into the door that goes to the back of the kitchen to eat, which is good, and then came out and washed her hands. Maybe it would've been better to wash her hands before touching food that they will serve to customers. \n\nFinally, despite the long wait for service and slightly disturbed by the kitchen staff's lack of appropriate hand washing we were glad that we got our food because we were very hungry at that point (about 2 hrs since arrival). I ordered the Plow (the most popular dish), my husband ordered the pork chop and eggs. First, the potatoes are very good. It has a hard crispy outside and very soft center. It is also perfectly seasoned with salt, rosemary, grilled onions, and other herbs. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also delicious. They were light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness, it's one of the best pancakes I've had. I wish there were more than just two small ones. I ordered pork sausages and scrambled eggs. The sausages were nothing special, actually tasted a little dry. The scrambled eggs were nicely cooked to a soft scramble. For my husband's order, the pork chop is a decent size, but the marinade was overwhelmed with fish sauce. I understand that the pork chop is Vietnamese style, but all I can taste is fish sauce and nothing else. For his order, he also got scrambled eggs, and it also came with potatoes. \n\nOverall, I would give the food a four star, I would deduct a star because I don't think the food is good enough to worth that much wait, also for the slow service and poor hygiene.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-09-19"}, {"excerpts": ["It was clear what their signature dish is that all tourists and locals like to order alike ...\n\nthe plow - two eggs sunny side up, two lemon ricotta pancakes, plow potatoes with house made pork sausage.\n\n", "And now the lemon ricotta pancakes: WERE THE ABSOLUTE BEST!

Imagine a skin that shatters the moment it meets your front teeth. I would deep fry the heck out of my home fries the way that the folks at Plow do.\n\nThey've also mastered the art of cooking fluffy eggs, complete with crispy edges and runny yolks. Lemon ricotta pancakes? Tart and complemented every bite of potato that came after. The housemade pork patties exploded with juice and delectable flavor, ever so slightly caramelized on the outside by the flattop. The bacon on the sandwich was pliant, but it was clear that finishing it off on the flat-top really did it crispy justice. And wow, I hate frisee in every mixed greens salad I eat, but the bitter vegetable actually went so well with the fluffy Acme bread, meat, and eggs.\n\nThe cinnamon roll was a 9/10 on the indie pastry scale. I found it a little bit dry, but it satisfied a month-long craving for gooey cinnamon buns and it was made quite well.\n\nService is very friendly here, and despite the hustle and bustle, I was impressed by their professionalism and their ability to work with each other in the kitchen. Cue cooks working together to plate a sandwich, with one guy handling all eggs and another one popping the buns right off the flattop. Plus, our water jug never ran low.

No, it's not worth the horrendous weekend wait; however, it is worth the hassles of going early on a weekday. \n\nThe menu is always changing, with some staples such as the plow, the breakfast sandwich, some type of French toast, and the buttermilk biscuit. It seemed like some of the specialties could be hit-or-miss (I saw someone next to me get something that looked fancy but small.) I'm also usually a fan of French toast, but in a lot of pictures it was surprisingly burnt here. Thus, I went with their signature plow. \n\nThe Plow plate is the epitome of perfection on classic brunch items. In fact, I was almost going to pass on Plow because it seemed so commonplace, yet so professionally crafted. It seemed as if so much thought had been put into every detail, you could perform mindful eating with your otherwise mundane sausage/bacon, eggs, potatoes, and pancakes. My thoughts:\n\n1. Lemon ricotta pancakes - the most memorable! Soft and fluffy (albeit a bit burnt), with a refreshing lemon zest balanced by an attenuated sweetness and a touch of creamy ricotta.\n2.

The texture, consistency, and taste were all well executed. It used less butter than some of the more indulgent scrambles I've had, making it a lighter version.\n\nI had expected portions to be bigger for the $17 pricetag on the bouge equivalent of a McDonald's big breakfast. If you eat it slowly, you'll enjoy it more and it the portion size turns turns out to lie within the narrow window of satisfaction without a debilitating food coma.

Plow is a weekday and weekend breakfast and brunch eatery.  The restaurant is small and casual though the d\u00e9cor is nicely done featuring homey but still contemporary notes.  The counter is nice and provides an excellent view of the short order counter where the team of chefs here efficiently crank out breakfast dishes like a well-run greasy spoon.\n\nThe food at Plow is not greasy spoon staples though.  You will see more upscale ingredients here like prosciutto and frisee as well as some great looking bread from a prestigious San Francisco bakery.  I had The Plow, which is their signature breakfast plate.  It is a hearty plate featuring two eggs, crispy fried potatoes with onions, choice of meat (chicken apple sausage, pork sausage patties or bacon), and two lemon ricotta pancakes.\n\nWith the exception of the lemon ricotta pancakes, this breakfast veered more towards fairly classic interpretations.  I had the eggs sunny side up, and they were quite good.  I would have liked the egg yolk a little less done, but the flavor was great.  The crispy potatoes were quite delicious.  The caramelized onions provided a mild sweet flavor while the potatoes combined a satisfying crispy exterior with a hot and soft center.  I also had their bacon, which was Nueske's bacon, a popular Midwestern bacon from Wisconsin.  The bacon had a smoky flavor as well as an appetizing pork flavor from the crispy fat.\n\nThe bacon was not as thick as Niman Ranch bacon, but the flavor was definitely memorable.  I also ordered their pork sausage patties, and these were good though I probably did prefer the bacon.  The center of the sausage was moist while the outside was well seared and crispy.  They get a little more adventurous with the seasoning so you get more herb and fennel notes with their sausage than you would experience at most breakfast spots.\n\nThe kitchen gussied up the pancakes a little more than they did with the other breakfast items in The Plow.  The pancakes featured both lemon and ricotta.  The lemon was nice.  It provided a noticeable lemon flavor as well as a lot of freshness.  I felt though that the ricotta probably hurt the pancake more than it helped it.  The pancakes had a great color and the smell of the pancake was very inviting.  Unfortunately, the pancake could have been sweeter.  The center was also a tad on the dry side and did not have that light and fluffy cake-like texture you would expect in an excellent pancake.\n\nService was fairly quick given how busy this restaurant gets (even on weekdays).  Prices are higher than your standard breakfast spot, but the ingredients at Plow are definitely high quality and the portions are surprisingly generous.\n\nI enjoyed The Plow at Plow though I felt the savory items were far superior to the disappointing lemon ricotta pancakes.

While pretending to be a flowerpots sitting on the sills outside, we decided to imbibe some self serve coffee (very strong - solid flavors). \n\nUpon being seated a little over an hour later, I noticed how once again new San Francisco the place is with a minimalist look, lots of natural lighting and light woodsy interior. It was also very cramped inside, but we did not want to wait extra for al fresco dining. \n\nOf course I ordered the Plow which came with the lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes and opted for the pork sausage and my eggs over medium. I also had a camellia iced tea on the side. I thoroughly enjoyed the fluffly sweetness of the pancakes but the CRISPY POTATOES were the star of the show; I now have a much higher standard for my brunch potatoes. The eggs were cooked perfectly (over medium is not really a thing so basically over easy). However the pork sausage was a huge letdown as it was very dry and had whole cumin seeds in it. It was remediable with dashes of Youk's hot sauce, but it was really just tough and dry. I had a bite of my friend's fried egg sandwich with avocado and it was stellar (though this is something rather difficult to not succeed in). The camellia iced tea was blase but refreshing.\n\nService was wonderful and our waters and teas were refilled regularly.

We were flexible with either inside or outside tables to cut the wait time so I was a bit confused when two parties of 2 after us in line got seated inside before us.  \n\nWe got one of the outside tables that they start opening up at 8:30 and although it was a bit chilly, they provide blankets to keep you warm or to use as a backrest if you happen to be leaning back on an incline.  Per Ben's recommendation, we knew we had to get the Plow and if I did not just buy 7 pastries from Neighbor, we would have both gotten the Plow.  Lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, pork sausage and two eggs anyway you like (we like poached), it is brunch heaven on a plate.  For our second order, we decided to go for a full order of lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and Vermont maple syrup.  If you order just pancakes, they are larger and thicker than the ones that comes with the Plow and comes with an order of 3.  At first bite, it tastes fluffy and light but as time goes by, you realize it is also decadent because of the ricotta with the hint of lemon lending a brightness to it.  \n\nIf I lived in the city and could get here even earlier without having to get up at 6AM, you would see me here more often so if this is Ben's way of getting us to move to SF, it may just be working!  Seriously though, although it is not foreign to me to wait in line for good food my limit would still be an hour.

Typically, this will sway me away from any place, but after seeing all the pictures, reading all the reviews, and also hearing from several of my SF friends how delicious it was, I ponied up and decided to make my way there.  \n\nMy husband and I opted to try it out over the 4th of July weekend on a Friday mid-day, hoping to avoid the Saturday/Sunday brunch crowd.  We just prepared ourselves for a long wait - we ended up getting there around 12:30PM or so, and I think we waited for about an hour, which isn't bad.  My husband grabbed a beer as we waited, and I popped in to one of the boutique stores just up the block to browse/bum time.\n\nWhen I was browsing at the store, I asked the store owner what she recommended at Plow.  She started off by highly recommending the \"Plow\" plate to get a sampling of all their stuff, said to (\"whatever you do\") get the baked good of the day if they aren't sold out, and then proceeded to pretty much list off every item they offered.  Pretty much, I knew right then and there that Plow would be a repeat brunch spot ;)\n\nEverything we tried was excellent - every item blew my mind.  You can tell that every ingredient they use is high quality, in season, and fresh.  The eggs, for example - the yolks are bright orange, and whites so fluffy.  I learned that they buy their eggs from a local organic egg farmer in Napa - always delivered fresh.  \n\nWhile we wanted to try everything on the menu, we tried:\n\nThe Plow (two lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs any style, choice of pork sausage/chicken sausage/bacon, crispy potatoes) *****5 stars*****- We decided to share the Plow so we could try a bunch of the stuff they offered.

The lemon ricotta pancakes were the BEST pancakes ever, ever, ever, ever.  I will be getting these (at least as a \"side\") every single time.  Holy crap, so good.\n\nBanana Bread - *****4.5 stars***** One of the \"baked goods of the day\" - We thought it would be a bit much with everything else we were ordering, but since we received the recommendation to order \"whatever baked good they are offering\" we decided to go ahead.  We figured, \"well we can bring any left overs home.\"  Uhhhh, let's just say, there were no leftovers.  SO delicious; came out warm, had a crispy crust of sugar coating the top, had chunks of gooey bananas throughout, and buttery flavor.  Mmmm...\n\nLittle Gem Salad - *****5 stars ****** To balance out some of the savory of our meal, I decided to order a little gem salad.  I was expecting nothing special, but even the salad surprised me!  The dressing was amazing; fresh and tasty.  All ingredients were fresh, seasonal, and balanced everything nicely.  I wish I could get this salad for lunch every day!\n\nBubbles/Beer - We also opted to make it a true brunch and ordered some adult beverages.  Decent selection of beers and wine.  If a cup of joe is more your cup of tea ;) - I heard that their coffee (even their decaf) is excellent.\n\nOverall - this place is brunch/lunch perfection.

I ordered \"The Plow\" which consisted of two eggs any style, plow potatoes, your choice of house made pork sausage, bacon, or chicken sausage, and two lemon ricotta pancakes. \n\nSo I never usually finish my potatoes at any brunch place but omg these were amazing. It was roasted perfectly with rosemary and super crispy. The sausage was seasoned perfectly and my over easy eggs were pleasingly runny. But the real star was the pancakes. How they make it so fluffy and light I will never know. They had a super strong lemon flavor. So, if you don't like lemon, don't order. But how could you not? \n\nI would definitely go back to try the other items on the menu. The plum ricotta pancake seemed interesting. If you're a first timer, you really can't go wrong with \"the plow\" because the dish includes everything that you would want to try as a first timer.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Was thrilled to see blood sausage on the menu and loved it, but was also quite envious of my companion's lemon ricotta pancakes.  \n\n"], "author": "David T.", "review": "Outstanding.

"], "author": "Nicole C.", "review": "If you reside in San Francisco and do not live under a rock, chances are you've heard of Plow. This may be because the food is delicious. It is equally possible you know them only for their ridiculous wait times (a problem that has become emblematic of any metropolitan area with a love of basic, bougie, boozy brunch). \n\nBrief summary of why the food is great. Any Google search will yield that it is \"comfort\" and \"rustic style.\" What this means in practice is an almost southern amount of decadence with all of the artisanal perks of any bay area establishment. You have your all inclusive brunch platter called \"The Plow.\" But the menu also has chia seed pudding and a plate of gluten free, almond flour pancakes. \n\nMore on The Plow. It's probably the best option on the menu, especially for a first timer. Eggs are prepared to your liking, and you get the choice between pork sausage, chicken apple sausage, and bacon. However the main attractions are the potatoes (so popular they are named \"plow potatoes\"). These little guys are perfectly crispy on the outside but ultimately melt on your tongue. Anyone on a diet--please evacuate immediately. To add insult to carbaphobic injury, the lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. They are smaller than you'd expect, which is both a curse and a blessing.\n\nThe great food isn't the only reason this place is so busy. The interior of the restaurant is tiny, as if it is trying to spite you and your hungry stomach. There is ample outdoor seating for those who are waiting to be seated, but I'd also recommend exploring the surrounding area, or even walking all the way to the Mission, like one Yelper did. You will literally have enough time to walk several miles and back (if you can bear the hill, that is). Especially if you're trying to score brunch on a Sunday (but why would you do that to yourself). Alternatively, ordering a grapefruit mimosa is another good way to kill time.\n\nIf you plan on wandering--which I highly suggest--make sure you call them periodically or come back by the suggested time. When they invite people to come in, they do not call said people on the phone. If you aren't there, your spot is lost to the next people in line. I'm pretty sure they do this on purpose as a form of line management. Every time someone is called and doesn't show up, everyone waiting outside cheers.\n\nI only eat here once a year, because that's about how long it takes for me to no longer feel disenchanted by the wait time. A year out, and the memory of the line suddenly feels less sharp. \"Maybe this time will be different,\" I think to myself. \n\nIt never is.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-10-02"}, {"excerpts": ["The Plow Breakfast is $16, comes with your choice of breakfast meat, eggs, rosemary potatoes and two mini lemon ricotta pancakes.

I'm usually not a lemon-flavored pastry type of person but the pancakes were so fluffy from the ricotta and refreshing and light from the lemon. I think they used just the lemon zest because they seemed perfumed with a lemon essence that I fell in love with.\n\nOverall Plow is a great place for breakfast. It's a little small so it's intended for smaller groups. Parking isn't too bad either...primarily residential parking spots. Just be patient and you'll eventually find one.

The moment we got our food all the waiting was well worth it. Everything was perfect. Next time I will definitely try to get different things because everything looked amazing. Particularly the french toast and the banana bread. The chicken Tinga also looked great. We ended up being seated at the counter and got to watch all the workers do their thing and jam to the music that was playing (literally everyone was dancing). \n\nThe one thing is that there isn't much to do in the surrounding area while you are waiting. So you have to rough it out and stand in front of the restaurant until that fateful moment when your name is called. Then again, maybe there is and I just don't know the area.

", "They were good, and I like the unique combination, but they didn't wow me.  "], "author": "Courtney K.", "review": "Bottom Line:  The food is delicious, the interior is cute and the service is friendly, but I don't think I'd typically wait more than 30 minutes to eat here.\n\nMy friend lives two block from Plow so as foodies and elite Yelpers, we had to give it a try.  If you are thinking about venturing to Potrero Hill yourself, here is some information that I hope will help you decide if Plow is worth the trip and the wait:\n\n- The Wait.  My take away from reading many Yelp reviews is that the wait runs one to two hours.  I really can't imagine waiting that long and luckily I didn't have to.  I arrived a few minutes before 8am on a Saturday and only waited about ten minutes for a party of two.  Since the restaurant doesn't open until 8am on Saturday, and we were able to get in on the first seating, we only had to wait long enough for the hostess to get to us.  It helped immensely that there were only two of us.  \n\n- Size Does Matter.  Plow is small and if your party is big, Plow won't be a good fit for you.  My recollection is that there are a handful of four-top tables but not many bigger options.  In fact, there website says they can only accommodate parties of six or less.  If you have a small party and want to sit at the counter, you can probably get seated faster.  And if you are a party of one, don't let the wait deter you, because you can probably snag a seat at the counter rather quickly.  \n\n- Food.  The food here is really good but not so good that I'd wait hours for it.  I do like how fresh their ingredients are and the uniqueness of some of their items.  You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients they use and I fully appreciate their efforts to source their ingredients locally.  Also, they make many items, like their ricotta and pork sausage in house.   Because I was starving, we (and by \"we,\" I mean \"I\") ordered lots of food.  \n\n   - Breakfast Dessert!: We were seated at the counter overlooking the freshly baked breakfast desserts so of course I had to order the chocolate chip walnut coffee cake to start.  That probably isn't the right name for it, but just know those breakfast desserts are good!\n\n   - Eggs Benny:  Plow's rendition of the classic Eggs Benedict was wonderful.  I did it with the Fra' Mani ham (Fra' Mani is a fancy pork company out of Berkley that sells its products wholesale and to Costco).\n\n   - The Plow:  Probably the most popular dish on the menu, my friend went with the Plow.  She started it and I finished it!  (Hey, I said I was starving.)  Even though I am not much of a breakfast potato person, I thought Plow's crispy potatoes were delicious and I ate way more of those potatoes than I would anyone else's breakfast potatoes!  I also really enjoyed the sausage.  I am sure it helped that I had been in town for a vegetarian wedding all weekend and was craving meat like a cave man.  The homemade pork sausage had great texture and flavor.  For me, the lemon ricotta pancakes weren't worth the hype.  They were good, and I like the unique combination, but they didn't wow me.  Nevertheless, I think Plow makes their own ricotta which is very cool and admirable.      \n\n- Service.  Service was friendly an attentive.  Despite a line out the door, the staff remains calm and keeps on plowing through the service.  I also like that they kept my coffee full and didn't rush us out of there.  \n\n- The ambiance is very cute and the d\u00e9cor is well done - hardwood floors, marble counter top, big windows and an open kitchen.  \n\n- Extras.  Plow is a very cute, cohesive, well-thought-out place.  They also have a great, classy web site.  I can tell the owners put a lot of love and pride into this business and for that I applaud them!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Lemon Ricotta Pancakes ", "+ ", "+ +: \nPancakes were a little crispy outside, fluffy and airy on the inside.

I know that it was a weekday morning and Christmas eve, but still, that's pretty amazing.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this place was that the tables were pretty close together. We could hear the conversation of the table next to us and if we stretched our arms out, we would have definitely hit them. I did not mind this all too much, since the people sitting next to us were super friendly. \n\nNow, the food/drink. I got the coffee while my friend got the 12-hour cold brewed iced coffee. He says that if you really need to wake up, the iced coffee is the way to go. We both ordered the plow. He got the chicken and apple sausage while I got the house made pork sausage. We also ordered a side of bacon. Everything was great! The potatoes were nice and crispy and the scrambled eggs I had were not dry. The lemon ricotta pancakes were AMAZING.

Hands down. I try to make a trip up for brunch every couple months or so. The lines here get super long especially on weekends, but trust me, it's worth the long agonizing wait. If it is your first time here, I would order the plow (5/5). It is just their breakfast platter with a little bit of everything. On my numerous trips back to this place, I also tried the fried egg sandwich (4/5) and their crab scramble (3/5). \n\nThe plow is basically the most amazing breakfast platter you will ever eat. It comes with a heaping pile of potatoes (5/5). The potatoes aren't your average hash brown or the soggy potatoes that come with a diner breakfast. These potatoes are super crispy and brown on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. You can hear the crunch as you bite down. You also have the option of bacon (4/5) or sausage (5/5). You really can't go wrong with either option. Their chicken apple sausage is the perfect amount of sweetness and savory. The bacon is fatty and rich. My only qualm is that the bacon is a little limp If you're really feeling hungry, get both! Why not! Also, with the plate comes the standard 2 eggs any way you like, I personally prefer them poached soft so you can dip the crispy potatoes and meat in the runny yolk. Finally, to top it all off, are 2 lemon ricotta pancakes (6/5). These pancakes are not your average fluffy pancake. They are slightly denser, but packed full of flavor. I'll be honest, I'm not a pancake person normally. Waffles win it all for me, but when it comes to these lemon ricotta pancakes, I would eat a hundred if I could. \n\nAs for the egg sandwich, they fry the egg to perfection. Yolk is perfectly runny, acting as a great sauce for the sandwich. The only reason this got a 4/5 in my book was due to the fact it really needed the addition of some meat. If you do get this sandwich, spend the extra couple bucks to add in some of that delicious bacon they have. Trust me, it'll take the sandwich to the next level. \n\nThe crab scramble had way too many green onions for my liking (I personally hate them and will pick them out given the chance, but this had way too many to do so). It covered up the taste of the crab a bit. There were large hunks of crab throughout the omelet which is great, but there were quite a few pieces of shells too, which made it a bit annoying to eat.\n\nAmazing food, great service - nothing more you could ask for.\n\nCons: \n- long wait on weekends and in the mornings \n- restaurant is small, so if you sit on the patio, it does get very cold\n\nPros: \n- brunch food here is A+ - everything is cooked to perfection\n- service is fast and friendly", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-11-30"}, {"excerpts": ["I've had their fried egg sandwich, avocado toast, lemon ricotta pancakes, french toast, and the plow.

It is a little loud, but comfortably so.\n \nPer Yelp's recommendations, we ordered four Plows and one fried chicken sandwich: two with bacon, one with pork sausage, and one with chicken apple. Each was amply sized:\n    * two delightfully sweet and light lemon ricotta pancakes\n    * two eggs cooked as you liked them (I had mine scrambled: so fluffy!)\n    * your meat option (the chicken apple sausages are nicely sweet)\n    * crispy potatoes.

She then showed us she had two Samantha's and that she called the other Samantha. I'm convinced she just didn't hear us when we said to add the high chair to our party, and added our names to the list as a new party which made the wait time even longer.\n\nWhat saved that encounter was a really sweet busboy who came and asked what name our party was under to see what the wait time was because he had noticed every one being called except us.

If you don't mind waiting for an hour plus then line up, if you don't, then try to visit during the week(tho still busy) for those pancakes and see if they measure up.

She was careful not to make eye contact with any patrons. Totally understandable, but it would have been so much fun to talk food. \n\nRuben started with a cup of Equator Coffee ($3.50) and we shared a Cinnamon Brioche ($4). It was a delicious rendition of a cinnamon roll and the center was perfectly gooey and flavorful. I selected The Plow ($16) with sunny side-up eggs, housemade pork sausage, two Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and crispy potatoes. The sausage was nice, but dry. Not my favorite sausage. Though the crispy potatoes were lovely and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were perfect! Ruben had the Fried Egg Sandwich with Nueske Bacon ($13.50), two soft fried eggs, aioli, cheddar, and fris\u00e9e on an Acme bun.

We arrived about 5 minutes or so after opening and got seated at the last table, which we shared with a couple that got in right before us.  Of course I was afraid that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but it did!  7x7 released a few months ago the recipe for Plow's lemon ricotta pancakes and I took a stab at making them.

The restaurant had quite a number of people, so we were kicked to curb, to wait in the wind. By kicking us to the curb, I mean they told us to step outside to wait till we're seated because they don't want it cramping up by the entrance. I like this idea because it makes the dining experience more enjoyable. They told us to wait about 5 mins, but we were seated within 3 mins. \n\nLocated on the corner of Mississippi St and Texas St, this place can easily be missed..only because it's located in a residential area. They do have a sign sticking out that says \"The Plow\" though. Parking wasn't bad for my friend and I because we found one quick, right across the street. \n\nSeated in the back, service was still prompt and good because they would come check on us quite often. The food came out fairly quick in about 10 minutes. For my drink, I ordered the housemade strawberry lemonade ($3.75) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#N3EwXeV_dXhdgR037ddEUw]. The drink looks adorable and instagram-worthy with its cute striped straw and lemon on the side, but don't let that fool you! I like the looks of it, but the straw is made of paper which can make it soggy. That's the only thing that irks me because the longer it sits in the lemonade, the faster it becomes soggy and the harder it becomes to drink. \n\nFor my dish, I ordered The Plow ($16) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#NYJXSTwF-Ugv0vFpKULyvQ] and a side of Nueske Bacon ($5.50) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#fzy-q83TFoTe12n157Wu4Q].

It changes your taste buds! \n\nThe side of nueske bacon was a recommended dish in the highlights and as a fan of bacon, I just haaad to order it!

Lacking sleep already and a night of turkey I needed something to bring a good morning 'ring' to my day as I was tired, and mediocre was not going to do, thankfully I have a cousin who knows about food, and still remembering from years before on how she took me to places, I could put my faith in her to deliver.\n\nShe said that this place usually has line-ups going up the block (as this place is located on a hill), so to get here early, we arrived at 8 AM, the place was not empty, but it wasn't packed, probably being a holiday. It was a charming little place with real high ceilings, very bright white walls, defined by natural wood tables. It's a very happy, bright look, with the open kitchen concept that seems standard nowadays with new restaurants.\n\nOnce we sat down, we were presented the menu, and looking at that pageful of items to order, the problem was to decide on what to order. From pancakes, eggs, bacon, granola, sandwiches and salads, everything looked so good. My cousin and her husband had 'the Plow' which consists of two eggs, two pancakes, and they decided on the Nueske bacon. My partner ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and I decided on the corned beef hash with yukon gold potatoes, chillies, and two eggs. As it wasn't that busy when we were here, the orders came quite quickly.\n\nSpeaking on my dish of hash browns, this was pefectly done, little bits of pefectly cooked potatoes mixed with strands of corned beef, and this was the stuff on the bottom of the plate. You could taste the freshness of the ingredients mixed with some chili to provide a kick, this was under the two sunny side eggs that were laid on top of the hash, welcoming me to breakfast like a set of eyes. Two small pieces of bread were laid on the top side of the eggs and I was ready to devour like a monster looking at this thing. My partner's pancakes were fluffy and had a good dense chew. I remember a smile everytime I took a bite, and I also remember my partners fork constantly coming over to my plate picking at little pieces of potato and meat.\n\nAnother thing that was damn good was the bacon here, whatever farmer they are getting this stuff from, it's like crack.

That in itself is not a problem. Gloves usually lend a false sense of security, because they are not changed each time they come into contact with food. Often, workers touch all of the same contaminated surfaces with gloves, and then go on to touch food, then go back to touching equipment.

The pancakes were something i've never had before, definately can taste the lemon zest, and the ricotta just gave the batter that creamy-sweet taste. It was extremely delcious!!!! And the pure maple syrup, you dont need that much on the pancakes. Highly recommend trying.\n\nCHICKEN APPLE SAUSAGE ($4) - kind of pricy for three sausage links. But it was definately needed to balance the sweet and creamy on the palate with some savory. Worth every penny after one bite. The sausages were perfectly cooked, browned on the outside and tender on the inside. \n\nCAMELLIA BLOSSOMED ICE TEA ($3) - it was served in a class with a lemon slice. Didn't add any sweetners and kepted it plain; taste real good with the lemon slice inside. Might not be for all palates but for those who like iced tea, this is for you.\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY H2O (Free) - love it when a restaurant brings out a chic glass bottle of water for the table. pour your own water!!!\n\nThe total of my bill was about $20 bucks. I left not feeling heavy nor gross. I left feeling refreshed and ready to start a long day in corporate america. That's a great feeling when you've ate well. \n\nWill I be back? Definately. I'll need to call people up to see if they'd like to wait in the long line with me on the weekend. If not, I can come back here alone and by myself at 7:30AM again. \n\nJABA APPROVED.

But land too many hits on her (when she has 5 bars), and she'll turn into the bitch from hell. My health bar waiting at Plow was at that magic pixel of life remaining, and there was one moment where that final punch landed on me, and it was on... full on Dark Phoenix sour puss bitch-face for me the rest of the meal.\n\nHere's the tl;dr version of this review: Only eat here as a pair; not a 3-some, not a group of 4; Budda help you if you're a party of five or more. The food is better than average. The price is hipster high. And the wait is long and not worth it. The staff is friendly once you're seated.\n\nBack to the fighting game analogy; I started off the morning at full life. Sure, we had to wake up at 7:30AM on a Sunday to drive across town to eat here; but I knew what I was getting into. This is SF, brunch waits are supposed to be brutal, but it'll all be okay in the end... I know that. I also understand that when a party of four shows up, we'll have to wait for a space to free up to get seated. But when MULTIPLE groups of pairs and THREE people parties were being seated ahead of my four-person party, my life bar took a hit. Why couldn't they just wait for 2 pairs seated near each other to leave and push those two tables together for us? I guess the business sense I gathered from this experience was: In the long run, it's okay to piss off a group of four customers, if you've already made 10 other customers happy. You still end up +6 overall.\n\nWhen we were finally were given a table (an hour later after being initially told a 30 minute wait... you know, because we were the 3rd on the list arriving at 8:15AM), my lifebar took another big hit when I saw that a family group of four (parents plus 2 kids) who DEFINITELY came by after us were already seated and getting their order taken. How did this other four person party have priority over us?\n\nLife's at a pixel now. The final blow? A pair who came later than us and who was seated before us finished their meal. Their table was cleared but was intentionally kept empty and not filled by the exponentially growing line behind us. When the second couple who sat adjacent to the now empty table left, the tables were cleared and the two tables pushed together to seat an incoming party of four. Why didn't this happen for us? \n\n\"I can't control it!\" And that was it. Even if they brought out food blessed by Alice Waters herself, it still wouldn't erase the bitterness and sour taste already in my mouth.\n\nI will say that the actual service of the waitstaff after we were seated was exceptionally friendly and kind. The food? The best food item for me were their potatoes. Top tier. The lemon ricotta pancakes were good, but not food nirvana like most of the reviews seem to think. Solid high tier. The eggs were prepared fine, but who really messes up scrambled eggs, you know? Mid-tier. The sausage was a bit dry and the bacon a bit flimsy. Low tier.\n\nI'm sure if things didn't start off on the wrong foot, I may have enjoyed my meal better. But for the price paid, it was just not worth the effort, even if the waitstaff was nice.

"], "author": "Marissa K.", "review": "This is one of the saddest, most frustrating reviews I've ever had to write. I discovered Plow in its first months and I was so excited. It had been forever since a really awesome new breakfast place knocked my socks off in SF. Everything was amazing, the restaurant was quaint and busy and clean, the service was impeccable. I came here again and again, and recommended it to my friends enthusiastically. I never wanted to yelp it because, selfishly, I hoped that it wouldn't become *too* popular. Of course, it did become popular, and the lines on the weekends got longer. Even so, I got up at 7am many a Saturday or Sunday morning to make it by 8am and beat the line. It was worth it. \n\nI first noticed things slipping in March 2012. I came with 2 other people, waited for an hour+ (wasn't surprised, I knew we'd have to wait). Then we were seated at a 4-top. However, the host informed us that really, we were only allowed to have one half of the table, and they were going to put a chair on the long end and seat another party in the other two seats. Yes, a table for 2 people (a standard 2-top) with a chair pushed onto a longside (in the tiny aisle). We couldn't even fit 3 plates of food and our water glasses on the table. We asked if we could wait for a larger table and were told no. Apparently, they only seat 3 people at tables for 2. OK. Even though it was expensive, and we were squished and basically sharing our table with strangers, I came back again and again anyway because the food was delicious, and aside from the seating issues, the service was good. \n\nI had been craving their lemon ricotta pancakes, and dragged my husband out of bed early yesterday morning. I was so excited to get there and be first in line when the doors opened. \n\nWe both ordered a coffee (they are $3.75 a piece, btw). Of course, it was 8am, and I drank my first cup in 5 minutes. Nobody came by to ask if I wanted a refill, so after trying to get someone's attention for 10 minutes, I got up and poured a refill myself. Remember, I was the first table in the restaurant. Nobody could possibly have been in the weeds yet. \n\nThe food came, and my bacon was practically raw. The waitress had set our food down and began taking the order of the table next to us. I waited until they were done and then tried to get her attention politely. I was probably too quiet and she didn't hear me. I said excuse me a little louder. And a little louder. I wasn't trying to be rude, just wanted to get her attention before she walked away since she hadn't been attentive and I didn't want to eat cold food. She seemed incredibly annoyed, even though I was nothing but polite about it. I thanked her profusely. She still hadn't offered me a single refill, so when she brought the bacon back, I asked for one. This also seemed to irritate her. Can I say it again? It was 8am. There's no reason for anything to be off with your first table of the day!\n\nAlone, that would be just bad service. But the food wasn't good. Like, not even diner-level good. My scrambled eggs were passable. The bacon came back fine. My lemon-ricotta pancakes were cold and rubbery. They tasted like they were day-old and had been sitting on the plate for an hour. My husband's eggs benedict (his usual favorite) was watery -- like the eggs hadn't been dried off before they were dropped on the spinach. And there was the tiniest serving of hollandaise sauce -- a smattering on top. These items used to be amazing. They were not just less-than amazing, they were subpar. If the waitress had been even the tiniest bit attentive, I might have pointed these things out to her. But at that point, I could feel her irritation, and I didn't want to complain to her about basically everything, particularly considering she was annoyed that I wanted a coffee refill.\n\nI wouldn't return to eat that food. Combine that with the irritated service from the waitress whose long hair wasn't tied back, but hanging over her shoulder. And the fact that this cost us $50. Two coffees and two breakfasts. \n\nMinus 1 star each for the food, the service, the wait and the price that adds insult to injury. I'm sorry, Plow. It was good when it was good.

The savory sausage gravy over perfected buttermilk biscuits...amazing! And of course the lemon ricotta pancakes and the plow potatoes that I have read so much about were better than I expected. I am very picky about home fries/hash browns, and often find most restaurants just miss the mark, but Plow's technique of cooking their potatoes ensures every bite is full of flavor. \n\nI can not say enough about my breakfast experience!!

I wrote a review of Plow a little over 3 years ago and after many more visits, I feel compelled to update my review. \n\nTHE FOOD: Still good, sometimes great. I often find myself craving their lemon ricotta pancakes and when that happens, nothing else will do. They really are that good. And other dishes are reliably good in a way where you can't really go wrong. BUT...my husband and eating partner-in-crime pretty much always orders eggs benedict at Plow and at any other breakfast/brunch establishment. The past maybe 5-7 trips to Plow have resulted in unpredictably cooked eggs on this dish. About 50% of the time, one or both of the eggs in his eggs benedict have been overcooked and either partially or completely lack a runny yolk...total bummer for an eggs benedict lover. We began to sort of hold our breath as he'd cut into his eggs, not really knowing what to expect. Otherwise, the food has continued to be reliably good for the most part.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Sadly, it's the service that's prompted me to update my humble review. And let me say that I'm not taking to my computer after one negative experience like some crazy hothead. Being totally reasonable, I can appreciate Plow having an \"off\" day. It's only after this started to become the norm that I took notice. Here are a couple examples of recent experiences:\n\n- Husband and I recently sat at the counter just on the other side of the glass from Maxine, the owner. We placed our typical huge order: coffee, orange juice, pastry of the day and cold-smoked salmon toast to share, lemon ricotta pancakes, and eggs benedict. (Told you - major fatties.) About 5 minutes after placing our order, we decided we wanted a side of bacon. So we asked our server if we could add this and were told it would be no problem. I mean, it's bacon, right? That should be pretty easy to toss in. So our food starts to come out and we dig in. First the pastry and salmon toast, then the pancakes and eggs benedict. No bacon in sight. We don't want to be jerks so we don't say anything just thinking that it'll show up soon. Well, fast forward to the end of our meal. We are to the point where our plates are empty and the server is asking us if she can clear them. We say Of Course! and also toss in that the bacon never arrived and that we don't need it at this point. Maxine overheard this and it immediately throws herself into our interaction by saying, \"It's coming out right now\" with what felt like a snippy tone. I sort of felt like we were in trouble but still managed to sheepishly say, \"But we're all done with our food. I mean, our plates are being taken away,\" to which Maxine  curtly replied, \"So you don't want it then?\" Maybe it's just me but it's not fun going out to eat and then feeling getting scolded by the owner and being made to feel like you've done something wrong. Actually, we were sort of expecting an apology when she jumped into the conversation. When she first started to speak, what I was expecting was more of a \"I'm so sorry! It looks like you guys are done eating. Do you still want the bacon even though it's late? Totally fine if you don't.\" \n\n- Last weekend we had some family in town and wanted to take them to Plow as we definitely enjoy the food. Knowing that a monster wait develops almost immediately, we got there at 7:30am to ensure we were the first people in line. As we stood there waiting, we all took turns studying the menu hanging on the front door planning what we were going to get. My husband, of course, was telling our family how he always gets the eggs benedict and that it's his favorite. So my mother decides she wants to try it too. The door opens at 8am and in we go. My mom orders first and requests the eggs benedict. The server quickly says, \"I'm so sorry but the eggs benedict isn't available yet.\" And we're all crestfallen. Half of our party was planning to order eggs benedict and it's really the one breakfast thing my husband will eat. So my husband politely asks, \"What does that mean - 'not ready'?\" She says their hollandaise sauce isn't ready yet and that it should take about 30 minutes. So we ask for a few minutes to figure out our plan. We decide we've got plenty of time and decide to wait the 30 minutes with some extra smaller plates to start. When the server returns, we tell her we're going to wait for the eggs benedict but order a few smaller things in the meantime. She says, \"I can't do that and have you hold the table that long.\" We go back and forth and then my husband asks why it takes so long to make hollandaise. He tells her it only takes a few minutes to do and that he doesn't understand. She says she doesn't know how it's made but she'll go ask and is clearly miffed with us. She returns quickly and says, \"Okay, they'll do it. It's ready.\" But we definitely feel the brunt of her irritation and again feel like we're in the  Principal's office and have done something wrong. Major mood-killer and unnecessary.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-08-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were nice and syrupy, but not sickeningly sweet.

The line was consistently long the entire time we were in the neighborhood, so unless you come substantially earlier I don't think there's any avoiding the queue.  You can grab a coffee from them (a nice brew) while you're in line, but I would eat something before coming, anticipating that brunch could actually become lunch before you know it.\n\nThe food at Plow is very fresh and quite tasty.

The market fruit platter consists of a tiny portion of grapes and berries and a sliver of a mango for $6; the other items we ordered were on the pricey side but not unreasonable.\n\nOverall, I think that eating at Plow could have been a  great experience, but, feeling faint and starving after the long wait, I devoured my food and didn't have a chance to enjoy the flavors or the ambiance.  If you have a scout who can get your name on the list early or want to wander around the pretty Potrero Hill neighborhood for a while on a lazy, sunny Sunday, Plow is a great place to eat.

It's our best chance.\" Look at the things we do for love!\n\nWe went (though I dragged my feet getting out of bed) and arrived around 8:30. The wait was going to be between 1 to 1.5 hours. (!!!!!)

As luck would have it, we were seated after about 30 minutes. We ordered quickly -- two coffees, two dungeness crab scrambles, one side order of lemon ricotta pancakes, please! \n\nAnd then we waited for an hour. We watched all the people around us get their food and begin eating. Our server came over to explain there had been a snafu in the kitchen and our food was just being fired. No apologies. No offer of something to put in our stomachs in the meantime to offset the three cups of coffee we had been drinking during the wait. We watched the people who were seated after us finish and pay their bill before our meals arrived. And then when it did arrive, it was fine... fine as in mediocre, not fine as in \"all is right in the world.\" Our scrambles were pretty salty and we got one tiny pancake to split... perhaps we could have asked for more info on what the \"side\" of pancakes consisted of.\n\nWhen we got our tab, we still got no apologies, nothing comped off of our bill, and no fulfillment from our experience.

I viewed their website in advance and was aware that they did not take reservations and were a small venue that could only accommodate up to six in a group, so we kept our group to six.   We had heard good things about Plow and we were excited to give it a try. \n\nWe arrived on a Sunday at 9:00 a.m. and we were told that it would be an hour wait.  The wait wasn't actually that long.  It felt like 20 minutes but it was probably 40 as we were busy chatting.  We sat outside.  \n\nAs we looked at the menu, someone pointed out a sentence in italics that said something to the effect of \"no modifications to the menu.\"  I don't have the exact wording.  Well, to start, that's a bit of a buzz kill as who doesn't modify something even a little?  I decided to order all \"sides\" so that I could enjoy what I wanted and not have a plate with things that I don't care for included.  Very simply put, I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, crispy potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  How can you go wrong with that?   No where on the menu did it say that the crispy potatoes were \"rosemary crispy potatoes\" and it just so happens that rosemary does not agree with me and I stay far away from it.  It spilled over into my scrambled eggs, and I could not have been more disappointed. As a group we made our own modifications, and friends shared pancakes and meat that they would not ordinarily order.  Friends enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes and the buttermilk biscuits and the eggs seemed to be quite fresh.  \n\nOn a more important note, the waitress that we had was anything but cheerful. She didn't appear to be overly friendly to anyone outside.  From the moment we sat down, we felt her negative energy and lack of any form of customer service.  Overall, we had a great time together, the food was good, but the service was not anything to write home about.

The lemon ricotta pancakes left me wishing I had just ordered fifteen of them and nothing else!\n\nI would have given five stars, but there is a price to pay for eating at Plow --- the wait. The two times I went were during lulls; I had \"late brunch\" at 2pm, and I had brunch during the holidays when most people were out of town. I waited 45min and 30min respectively, and I was lucky. The 45min wait would have been much longer, but two parties ahead of us changed their minds and left. I can only imagine what the wait must be like at \"normal\" hours. It's typical to see a crowd of people waiting outside Plow when you walk by on the weekend. A long wait is almost part of the experience! They don't take reservations so there is no way around it.

It is a small, hip, and trendy brunch spot. Their menu changes weekly, so come back often. The boast fresh organic produce from local farms, which is the norm in San Francisco, but not the standard.\n\nTheir french toast is crunchy outside with a custard-like creaminess inside, delicately sweet and garnished with fresh berries and a brulee'd banana. Served with subtle sweet Vermont syrup (not too sweet, not too thick, just perfect syrup). \n\nLemon ricotta pancakes is my favorite and it's one of the reasons I keep coming back. I have convinced many patrons to try their lemon ricotta pancakes when I brunch here. They are dense with pockets filled with ricotta (a light cheese, similar to mozzarella) and a subtle lemon flavor. I've tried to replicate their lemon-ricotta pancakes and while my pancakes can be similar in taste, they do not have the same thick, rich and hearty elements that Plow creates.\n\nThe eggs benedict are okay. The star of the dish is the hollandaise sauce which I feel is too zesty.  Most holllandaise sauce has a mild creamy flavor with subtle tang, however Plow's hollandaise sauce has a robust tang that overpowers the other mildly flavored components. I suspect a heavy hand in lemon juice. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. \n\n\"The Plow\" is a good way to sample all of their good things (it comes with lemon ricotta pancakes -smaller version). The potatoes are tasty but their inconsistent size makes the large pieces stand out in buttery goodness and the tiny bits too burnt to eat. Their homemade sausages are a bit dry. However, you can't go wrong with the chicken apple sausages (yum). \n\nThe house made organic yogurt + granola with fresh fruit is not worth it. I think that it could have used more berries and less citrus fruits in my honest opinion. \n\nThe fried egg sandwich is okay. The nueske bacon makes it a tad better. The acme bun was lovely. Everything else was standard. \n\nThe dungenous crab scramble was tasty. It had hearty pieces of crab meat. Definitely a go to dish to try. But I think it's a bit pricey at $17. \n\nThe almond pancake was disappointing. I didn't taste any flavor of almond. But I suppose that it is a fan for gluten-free eaters. \n\nThe counter seating is quite small and can be uncomfortable, however that's where you get to see the magic of everything being cooked. I like sitting outside because it's quieter. Inside its warm and loud. \n\nPrice wise, I think it's expensive. IMO, I think that brunch should be $10 and under. Many of the dishes here can be made at home for the fraction of the price. The prices here $10-$17 per meal. Not including extra such as drinks or side dishes. The coffee alone is a whopping $3.75.\n\nOverall, I think that the food is prepared well and presented beautifully. I will return because think their lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious.

Best evidence are the potatoes that come with the dishes: Even for very fine breakfast establishments, home fries or hash browns or whatever the accompanying spud side happens to be, is often an afterthought and underwhelming.  At Plow, the potatoes must be cooked twice.  They appear to be smashed before frying which likely means they were boiled or blanched first.  They are seasoned liberally (but not overly) with prominent rosemary.  They are ridiculously good!  This care extends to the house-made sausage patties, lemon ricotta pancakes, biscuits and perfectly runny eggs.  Ingredients are all locally-sourced and periodic wine-paired dinner events involving local vintners are a real plus.  \n\nPlow serves as an anchor establishment in a classic San Francisco neighborhood, but, for better or worse (depending on whether you live close by, I guess), it has become one of the hottest breakfast tables in the City.  This reputation is well-deserved based on our experience.  The chef-owners' hearts are very clearly in the right place evidenced by the menu planning and preparation of the offerings.  It is very possible that the project that is Plow has taken on a life of its own, exceeding its initial space for sure and maybe even the scope that was intended.  That is certainly not the owners' fault and, yes, maybe the wait and crowds detract from the entire experience, but, in my opinion, the vision of a locally-sourced, locally-grounded restaurant that serves great food should be supported and congratulated.

I mean, have you SEEN that documentary on the Bieber maiden?\" At this point I was escorted out of the building as I yelled on about respect and was asked to wait outside with the others. Whatever happened to respecting a British detective?  \nA bloody rut. That's what I was in. The Case of the Missing Papaya Diamond wasn't having a lot of traction. Not for a bloody lack of trying, mind you. Imagine a montage set to a funky bass groove where I kick down doors and chase down perps in dark alleys, screaming at them for answers. And by \"chase down perps in dark alleys\" I mean \"eat a lot of waffles\" and by \"kick down doors\" I mean \"take naps\". Not sure who I was screaming at outside of the montage, either. No, this was a critical rut. \nIt was a Saturday morning stroll that brought me here to Plow. That, and the aroma of bacon. But this common occurrence of having to wait an hour to be seated still baffles me. The fact that most people are fine with this means that I'm either a savage barbarian with no patience or that I'm missing a key vantage point to this observation. So I just stood there in the morning sun, waiting. Thinking about the case. Thinking about little details. Things I might have missed. Overlooked. Suspects. Locations. \nAnd then it struck me.

My boyfriend and I huddled under an umbrella and the cute hostess brought us a giant mug of hot coffee to share outside on the corner.

VERY GOOD.\n     The tuna sandwich is hands down the BEST I've ever had. The tuna is tossed in olive oil, lightly salted, mixed with capers,  and extremely fresh. The boquerones (white anchovies in olive oil and vinegar) added an extra dimension of flavor to the sandwich. Add a little hard boiled egg and put it on bread from Acme, and you have a Masterpiece.\n     Unfortunately the portion sizes are bad.

Anyway, I finally bit the bullet and tried it out last weekend. The wait time was 45 minutes for a table for three. Ugh. They offer complementary coffee inside to soften the pain of waiting but it runs out quickly and people inside are too busy to keep it replenished. It is probably good business for Farley's, the coffee shop up the street.\n\nAnyway, we finally got seated and I have to say the ambiance is simple but nice. It's going for a clean rustic vibe to go along with it's philosophy of using local, seasonal, farm-fresh ingredients. I works for me. We shared the lemon ricotta pancakes. SUPER DELICIOUS. I got the Plow breakfast plate (I think that was the name) which included eggs, potatoes, and two pancakes. Even though it's a pretty standard dish it just tasted better than I expected. The potatoes are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and tossed with just the right amount of salt and some nice onions too. The freshness of the ingredients really makes a difference. I tried my friend's egg benedict with spinach and mushrooms and it was cooked to perfection. All our food was seemingly simple but wonderfully delicious and memorable. The nuances of the fresh ingredients really make all the difference in the flavors in the dishes. I felt totally satisfied but not overly stuffed nor heavy after my meal at Plow.

Yikes! I guess I should have expected it in a softly cooked egg but I had mistaken the sandwich for something I could eat by hand - you know, like a sandwich. So I put it down, cleaned myself up, then proceeded to eat it with knife and fork deconstructed style. Didn't really work because it was hard to get bread, frisee, spread, egg, cheese, bacon all in one bite. I ended up eating it one at a time and the bacon whole because I couldn't cut it into pieces with the knife.\n\nOkay, so these are all mishaps that shouldn't be held against the restaurant. However, in the end the food was just okay. Yes, it's better than your typical brunch place but I have high standards. The potatoes were crispy (deep fried instead of roasted) but bland. Definitely needed both salt and hot sauce to make interesting. Definitely looked better than they tasted. The sandwich wasn't that interesting - the extra for the bacon went to 2 skinny strips that I couldn't cut. Could barely taste the cheese. Was mostly a runny egg and nice bread meal.\n\nOverall, not worth the wait. If you live in the neighborhood and can stop by when there's no wait at all I'd bump it up to 3.5-4 stars possibly.

Paired with eggs, this terrific trio took me on a non-stop flight to gastro-paradise.   \n\nMy girlfriend loved her soft scrambled eggs with merguez sausage and even conceded to the home fry perfection, quite an accomplishment given that ambivalence is generally the best a breakfast potato can hope for from her.  We both loved the fresh squeezed orange juice, too, an item I can safely say we hold to nearly-impossibly-high standards.\n \nThe open layout, simple decor and beautiful photography created a pleasant ambiance, and our server was a picture of attentiveness and calm amidst the bustling scene.\n\nThere will be many return visits.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-10-20"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and my boyfriend had the soft scrambled eggs with the most delicious breakfast potatoes ever!

They call your name once or twice and if you're not there they just skip right over you even if they tell you to come back at a certain time.

I didn't even raise my voice or tone or anything like that, I simply wanted to know if I should wait here or go back to the coffee shop, because lady, you told me 25 minutes, I'm back in 20 and you tell me it's my fault and you gave away my table and refuse to hear me out?

Instead of just waiting outside, my friend and I decided to get coffee 2 blocks away to kill time. Also you can order coffee, drinks and baked goods from Plow as you wait for your table. \n\nIt was slightly over 1.5 hour wait and got a seat at the counter. We ordered **Equator coffee $3.75. Unlimited refills. We started with their **Hong Kong style toast  buttered brioche + sweetened condensed milk. I was super excited because its been forever since I had condensed milk. The brioche we had was super dry. Was a bit disappointed with that. We had one piece and let the milk soak in to soften up the brioche. My friend had their famous **\"The Plow\". Comes with everything, two eggs, choice of protein, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes + plow potatoes. She got the house made pork sausage patties. I thought it was super yummy. I got to try everything she had. I really like their triple fried plow potatoes. Must have!! I got their special **Cornbeef hash on poached eggs. I really like it. Wasn't too heavy.

I had the eggs sunny side up, and they were quite good.  I would have liked the egg yolk a little less done, but the flavor was great.  The crispy potatoes were quite delicious.  The caramelized onions provided a mild sweet flavor while the potatoes combined a satisfying crispy exterior with a hot and soft center.  I also had their bacon, which was Nueske's bacon, a popular Midwestern bacon from Wisconsin.  The bacon had a smoky flavor as well as an appetizing pork flavor from the crispy fat.\n\nThe bacon was not as thick as Niman Ranch bacon, but the flavor was definitely memorable.  I also ordered their pork sausage patties, and these were good though I probably did prefer the bacon.  The center of the sausage was moist while the outside was well seared and crispy.  They get a little more adventurous with the seasoning so you get more herb and fennel notes with their sausage than you would experience at most breakfast spots.\n\nThe kitchen gussied up the pancakes a little more than they did with the other breakfast items in The Plow.  The pancakes featured both lemon and ricotta.  The lemon was nice.  It provided a noticeable lemon flavor as well as a lot of freshness.  I felt though that the ricotta probably hurt the pancake more than it helped it.  The pancakes had a great color and the smell of the pancake was very inviting.  Unfortunately, the pancake could have been sweeter.  The center was also a tad on the dry side and did not have that light and fluffy cake-like texture you would expect in an excellent pancake.\n\nService was fairly quick given how busy this restaurant gets (even on weekdays).

It had some spiciness to it, which was great. My mom ordered the Smoked Trout Salad and my dad ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs. My mom's salad was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, large chunks of smoked trout, avocado, and a poached egg on the side. It was tasty. My dad's corned beef hash was decent. We've had better at Sally's Dinner on the corner of 16th and De Haro. Both are homemade, but the one from Sally's has a better texture.

Plow keeps their menu simple, but they do it well.\n\nI got the fried egg sandwich, constructed with two eggs, aioli, frisee, cheddar on an Acme bun. Pay the extra couple bucks for the Nueske bacon; you will not regret it. The sandwich was the perfect answer for breakfast. The bun was soft and airy, and the combination of melted cheese, fried eggs, and crispy bacon was heavenly. The crispy potatoes on the side were amazing. The best thing on the menu is the lemon ricotta pancakes. The texture was softer and crumblier than a normal pancake and the flavor was outstanding. It was probably one of the best pancakes I've ever had. \n\nOverall, I loved the breakfast here. The prices weren't cheap ($13 for the breakfast sandwich and $15 for the plow).

For our group of 5, we waited for around 1 hour and 30 minutes - luckily the SF marathon passed us just one block down the hill, so we were easily able to entertain ourselves that morning.\n\nPlow has this great, welcoming, and airy ambience.

We didn't feel rushed through, which is key after the inevitable wait, even on a weekday morning, which is when we went.\n\nI think the wait is the thing most people mention in their reviews, whether good or lukewarm. Like others, I was more than willing to wait a half hour for an outstanding breakfast -- but this was far from outstanding.\n\nFirst of all, the meals are a heart attack on a plate -- everything seems to be deep fried or cooked in vegetable oil (we sat at the bar, so we could see everything as it was cooked). My two friends got the Plow, which was two pancakes, eggs, breakfast meat, and toast. I ordered two eggs and the chicken apple sausage and toast.\n\nThe pancakes were, as others have written, delicious. The lemon flavoring makes them feel lighter than they are. The eggs were completely flavorless; my guess is that cooking with oil was behind this, rather than butter. I even had them add some cheese; what they added appeared on one side of the scramble but I didn't see cheese throughout.\n\nThe potatoes were delicious -- dude. Deep. Fried. How can they not be? Crispy and good. The toast was either a sour dough or almost Italian type bread which, when toasted, was hard to chew. The apple sausage was good, but not particularly memorable. For drinks, we ordered coffee and tea; they were happy with their coffee, my tea didn't stay very warm in the individual pot that was brought to the table.\n\nIn the end, if you do choose to go here, keep in mind that the portions are HUGE -- so perhaps share with someone at your table. I ate maybe a third of the eggs, 2 out of 4 of the sausage links, both small slices of toast, and maybe 1/2 the potatoes and left feeling very fool.

Yesterday morning though, we both woke up early and decided to try our luck.  Parking was pretty easy as we got a space across the street. We arrived about 5 minutes or so after opening and got seated at the last table, which we shared with a couple that got in right before us.  Of course I was afraid that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but it did!  7x7 released a few months ago the recipe for Plow's lemon ricotta pancakes and I took a stab at making them.  So, naturally I had to get The Plow ($16) & he instantly gravitated towards the Dungeness crab scramble ($17).  The waitress was coming around asking if we wanted coffee with her big pitcher.  Bf said yes and I declined since I'm so picky with coffee.  However, he (usually drinks black) and I (usually gets vanilla lattes and macchiatos) thought the coffee was quite good even with just a little bit of sugar, it was pretty mild.

The lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy, moist, and lemony; they were to die for.  The only thing that killed the breakfast was the sausage.  We were surprised that they were made into patties, and it did have some nice seasoning but they were so dry.  We had to dip the pieces into the egg yolk or pour syrup on them.  Perhaps they didn't put any fat in it and that's why it was so dry?  The dry sausage was really the only thing that killed the breakfast and prevented us from deeming Plow a 5 star breakfast.  \n\nOkay, I think even by SF standards the dishes are a little pricey for breakfast, but they're so worth it.  I'm gonna say a little gripe though, what I don't get is that, they offer free cups of coffee (refills too) for those stuck waiting for a table outside, but will ask around patrons dining if they'd like a cup...thought it may have been free, but was surprised to see the $3.50 charge on the receipt.

The coffee was excellent, and ultimately I didn't really mind paying for it, but I just wish it had been more clearly marked as something that would be added to the bill. But that was really the only downside to the experience, and in the end, the overall quality of service and food made up for it.

Crispy potatoes (5/5) - YES, so crispy on the outside, really well seasoned, but still buttery on the inside. Two overeasy eggs (4/5) - no complaints on the eggs themselves, wish they could have salted it a bit more though. House-made pork sausage (5/5) - really flavorful, it tasted like they mixed in little pieces of onions and herbs into it. Lemon ricotta pancakes (4/5) - actually not quite what I expected, for all that I hear about these pancakes, I was a little disappointed. The pancakes tasted really good, with just a hint of lemon that wasn't overpowering.

Two eggs over easy sandwiched by soft, toasted Acme bread with frisee, aioli and cheese with the additional Neuske bacon (everything is better with bacon!).

Yesterday morning though, we both woke up early and decided to try our luck.  Parking was pretty easy as we got a space across the street. We arrived about 5 minutes or so after opening and got seated at the last table, which we shared with a couple that got in right before us.  Of course I was afraid that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but it did!  7x7 released a few months ago the recipe for Plow's lemon ricotta pancakes and I took a stab at making them.  So, naturally I had to get The Plow ($16) & he instantly gravitated towards the Dungeness crab scramble ($17).  The waitress was coming around asking if we wanted coffee with her big pitcher.  Bf said yes and I declined since I'm so picky with coffee.  However, he (usually drinks black) and I (usually gets vanilla lattes and macchiatos) thought the coffee was quite good even with just a little bit of sugar, it was pretty mild.  The coffee was Equator.  \n\nThe Plow is two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, house potatoes and your choice of bacon, housemade pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage.  I chose to get the pork sausage.  I was so excited when our plates were finally in front of us.  His crab scramble was plentiful too and had a lot of fresh crab in it.  The creme fraiche was the perfect addition for the scramble.  He loved the house potatoes which was served with his meal too.  The toast it was served with was standard though.  As for my Plow: The eggs, which I chose over easy were perfectly cooked and the yolk just oozed all over once punctured.  The house potatoes were so crispy.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy, moist, and lemony; they were to die for.  The only thing that killed the breakfast was the sausage.  We were surprised that they were made into patties, and it did have some nice seasoning but they were so dry.  We had to dip the pieces into the egg yolk or pour syrup on them.  Perhaps they didn't put any fat in it and that's why it was so dry?  The dry sausage was really the only thing that killed the breakfast and prevented us from deeming Plow a 5 star breakfast.  \n\nOkay, I think even by SF standards the dishes are a little pricey for breakfast, but they're so worth it.  I'm gonna say a little gripe though, what I don't get is that, they offer free cups of coffee (refills too) for those stuck waiting for a table outside, but will ask around patrons dining if they'd like a cup...thought it may have been free, but was surprised to see the $3.50 charge on the receipt.  Bf was more optimistic than me though (even though he paid) and said, \"Well at least they kept filling me up.  Not all places give free refills.\"  Plow is a solid 4.5 stars.

I don't know why more brunch places don't offer this, but it's the person brunch platter for people who prefer mostly savory dishes with a small bit of sweet on the side.\n\nI've heard such good things about their lemon ricotta pancakes, so I knew I *had* to try them out. Almost everything was perfect about this platter: the eggs were perfectly scrambled, the potatoes were roasted just right, and OMG THE PANCAKES. They were so light with a nice lemon flavor that wasn't overpowering. The pancakes themselves aren't too sweet so you can control the sweetness with the syrup. The Plow platter comes with two mini pancakes, but I might need to order a whole side of these to myself next time! My only complaint was that the pork sausage wasn't that great.\n\nIt was so nice to come here with my girlfriends and catch up on life.

The food was good, but definitely not worth the two hour wait for a party of two. When we arrived, there were about 4-5 parties waiting outside; however, when I put my name down, I was told there was about 1.5 pages of parties ahead of us. We were told to expect a 45min to 1hr wait and decided to just wait outside. The host and hostess had called several parties without any response, so we thought it will probably be quick. After about 45 minutes of waiting and noticing that people arrived after us got seated first. Later, my husband went in and found out that, many of the parties showed up after they were called and placed back on the waitlist in their original orders; therefore, they were being seated before us. I have no problem waiting for good food, but I feel their system flawed. Usually you would have to go to the back of the line if you missed your name, but not at Plow. So, if you want to eat here, drop by and put your name down and return at the time convenient to you. \n\nAfter about 1.5hr wait, we were finally seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen area.

We were seated for about 10-15 minutes until someone finally came to offer water and coffee, then we were told that she would come back to take our order even though we said we were ready to place our orders. While we were waiting again, we noticed that the kitchen had a lull, since no orders were being placed, and the person putting all the food orders together was looking at his phone. Once the orders started going in, we saw that he did not wash his hands before starting to handle all the food. In addition, while waiting for our waitress, we saw that the hostess went into the kitchen area, reached in the pile of bacon and grabbed one with her bare hands. She went into the door that goes to the back of the kitchen to eat, which is good, and then came out and washed her hands. Maybe it would've been better to wash her hands before touching food that they will serve to customers. \n\nFinally, despite the long wait for service and slightly disturbed by the kitchen staff's lack of appropriate hand washing we were glad that we got our food because we were very hungry at that point (about 2 hrs since arrival). I ordered the Plow (the most popular dish), my husband ordered the pork chop and eggs. First, the potatoes are very good. It has a hard crispy outside and very soft center. It is also perfectly seasoned with salt, rosemary, grilled onions, and other herbs. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also delicious. They were light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness, it's one of the best pancakes I've had. I wish there were more than just two small ones. I ordered pork sausages and scrambled eggs. The sausages were nothing special, actually tasted a little dry. The scrambled eggs were nicely cooked to a soft scramble. For my husband's order, the pork chop is a decent size, but the marinade was overwhelmed with fish sauce. I understand that the pork chop is Vietnamese style, but all I can taste is fish sauce and nothing else. For his order, he also got scrambled eggs, and it also came with potatoes. \n\nOverall, I would give the food a four star, I would deduct a star because I don't think the food is good enough to worth that much wait, also for the slow service and poor hygiene.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-09-19"}, {"excerpts": ["It was clear what their signature dish is that all tourists and locals like to order alike ...\n\nthe plow - two eggs sunny side up, two lemon ricotta pancakes, plow potatoes with house made pork sausage.\n\n", "And now the lemon ricotta pancakes: WERE THE ABSOLUTE BEST!

The scrambled eggs cook very well and fluffy to eat which I did feel the softness of the eggs naturally. The potatoes cooked not bad and perfectly seasoned for both salt and black pepper.

Sausages were normal and egg was perfectly cooked with a runny middle!! \n\nMochi cake was also a good choice - moist and bouncy and not too sweet! But the crab scramble was kind of watery even though I was satisfied w/ the amount of crab provided. \n\nPrices were definitely more like brunch prices than breakfast prices ($$$$).

I have visited twice in the past year and tried a sampling of their items. Everything is good but nothing (and I truly mean nothing) is worth waiting more than 30 minutes. Plow is pretty small but the staff does cram quite a few tables in the narrow space which also has bar seating and outdoor tables. I would definitely not recommend coming if you have a large group, or really any group larger than 3. The space is very simple and perfect for a brunch joint. There is a ton of natural light which is perfect for snapping some pictures of your food which is what EVERYONE in this restaurant is doing all of the time.\n\nI have sampled the Plow, the Prosciutto and Gruyere toast and the Breakfast Sandwich. My least favorite was DEFINITELY the Plow. Super overrated and nothing on the plate was really noteworthy. The pancakes are pretty basic and I think compared to a lot of the other notable places in the city offering lemon ricotta pancakes, the weakest. The Prosciutto and Gruyere toast is a pretty solid option and the Breakfast Sandwich is good, if not basic. The prices are pretty high for what you get but considering how popular this place is, I suppose it is reasonable. The service is fine but be prepared to wait a bit for your food since the kitchen is pretty small.\n\nAll in all, I do like Plow and maybe this review is negative. I just think there are other places in the city preparing more innovative food that are less mobbed and have better pricing.

Don't let the size of the place fool you because the food they make will make you forget about the seating arrangement. \nMy go-to items are the breakfast sandwich (I recommend you treat yoself and get bacon and or avocado on it cause it dials up the awesomeness), buttermilk biscuits (make sure to get plenty of the rich sweet honey butter), and lemon ricotta pancakes. FYI the biscuits do run out so don't be sad if you get there late and they are out. However my favorite thing to order is The Plow, their namesake dish. You get 2 lemon ricotta pancakes, 2 eggs, potatoes, and choice of protein. The lemon ricotta pancakes are served with maple syrup and are fluffy delicious. They have just the right balance of lemon and ricotta so the pancake isn't soggy.

We proceeded to wait in line, and the line was quick, only for us to discover that the hostess was just taking down how many people were in your party and whether if you preferred sitting outside, inside, or no preference. She told us it would take 45 min before we were seated (we had 3 people and said we were fine sitting outside). I can imagine the long wait time for being seated since the venue is small, and the outside seating only had a few tables as well. When we checked in to see what our position in line was, it turned out that they already called us (though we missed it), but they told us we were next in line to be seated outside. So in total, our wait time was about an hour. Since it was a bit chilly, they offered blankets while we ate, which was a nice touch. The service was efficient and attentive. My friends really love biscuits so she ordered a biscuit as an appetizer and it was warm and delicious. I ordered The Plow, since it had a little bit of everything. It comes with 2 eggs, a choice of meat (I got the housemade pork sausage, potatoes, and 2 lemon ricotta pancakes. Although the items seemed small on the plate, it filled me up. The eggs were fluffy (I got them scrambled), the meat was a little dry but well seasoned, the potatoes were nice and crispy, and the pancakes were amazing and lemon-y. Overall, the food was amazing, though the wait time is a bit of a downer but there's plenty of places to walk around to while you wait, and if you're in the company of great friends, the wait time is no problem at all!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-11-08"}, {"excerpts": ["THE PLOW:\neffffinggg AMAZING.\n\n"], "author": "Mae Louise L.", "review": "HOLY SHIT!!!

House made sausage - a close second. The patties were wonderfully juicy without being too greasy, and I especially liked the extra dimension from the boldly heavy use of pepper and caraway. \n3. Potatoes - quite a bit of hype, but I found it to be just okay. It did have a nice crisp and aromatic tones from the rosemary, though I found the outer crunchy coating too thick, causing the potatoes to be too dry.\n4. Eggs - Scrambled eggs pretty on point. The texture, consistency, and taste were all well executed. It used less butter than some of the more indulgent scrambles I've had, making it a lighter version.\n\nI had expected portions to be bigger for the $17 pricetag on the bouge equivalent of a McDonald's big breakfast.

The week before I got to plow at 11:30am and it was a 2.5 hour wait for a party of 3. We couldn't wait because we were hungry. Came back this Saturday at 10:30am and it was 1.5 - 2 hour wait for a party of 2. WOW!!! I know, the wait is crazy long. Instead of just waiting outside, my friend and I decided to get coffee 2 blocks away to kill time. Also you can order coffee, drinks and baked goods from Plow as you wait for your table. \n\nIt was slightly over 1.5 hour wait and got a seat at the counter. We ordered **Equator coffee $3.75. Unlimited refills. We started with their **Hong Kong style toast  buttered brioche + sweetened condensed milk. I was super excited because its been forever since I had condensed milk. The brioche we had was super dry. Was a bit disappointed with that. We had one piece and let the milk soak in to soften up the brioche. My friend had their famous **\"The Plow\". Comes with everything, two eggs, choice of protein, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes + plow potatoes. She got the house made pork sausage patties. I thought it was super yummy. I got to try everything she had. I really like their triple fried plow potatoes. Must have!! I got their special **Cornbeef hash on poached eggs. I really like it. Wasn't too heavy.

"], "author": "Zare K.", "review": "It's a chilly late-December morning in the week after Christmas. I have the day off work and so, visions of soft-scrambled eggs and crispy potatoes dancing in my head, I head over to Plow for breakfast. There's a line outside, as there always is, but when I inquire with the hostess about the wait time she says there's a seat opening up at the counter and it should be free in just 10 minutes. Only 10 minutes! Lucky me! I settle in for a short wait.\n\nUnderstanding that things at a busy restaurant can take longer than expected, I wait some 30 minutes outside with nothing but a newspaper for company (no coffee, no seating)  before poking my head inside again to check on the wait. \"Not too much longer,\" says the hostess. Back outside I go to chill, and I mean that in the sense of being cold. Somewhere in there I watch the hostess walk down the street and step directly in front of a (slowly, thank God) moving bus. Another 15 minutes pass so again, I ask to check on my progress. \"Sorry, there's nothing available yet\" says the hostess, looking agitated. Perhaps she's grumpy from getting honked at by the bus.\n\nFifty minutes after I first arrived--yes, that's 50, five with a zero after it, as in 5x the original estimated wait time--the hostess finally gestures for me to come inside. Alas, the seat isn't actually ready so she abandons me to stand in the small front lobby. For 5 minutes I wait awkwardly looking at the sign asking people not to stand in the small front lobby. At some point a busboy tries to shoo me outside.\n\nFinally--oh, miracle of miracles! a place setting is prepared and I sit down at the counter. Frozen and too hungry to think straight, I eagerly accept the server's offer of coffee while I contemplate the menu. A man arrives and is seated next to me. He asks to order a moment later and the server obliges him, taking his food order ahead of mine. When he tries to chat me up later it takes a great deal of my self-restraint not to stab him with my fork.\n\n\"Ah, but how was the breakfast?\" you ask. The breakfast was fine. Okay, taken on its own merits it was more than fine. The soft-scrambled eggs were creamy and tender with perfectly cooked mushrooms and greens. The Plow potatoes were hot and crispy. Their coffee is nice and strong and served in big hand-warming mugs. No one can dispute that Plow's cooks have their technique down. And just to be clear, I take no issue with Plow's long wait times as such--it was the completely bogus time estimate, along with the sneaking suspicion that I as a solo diner got bumped down the list--that had my hangrily grinding my teeth.\n\nI share the tale of this ordeal with you, dear readers, because it prompted me to make a serious lifestyle change. No more waiting in line for brunch. Don't do it. Cook breakfast at home. You too can learn to make hollandaise sauce. Go out for pho or a bowl of porridge with Chinese doughnuts. Most pho restaurants even have coffee! Anything but the interminable wait accompanied by the gurgling Gastrointestinal Orchestra of hunger.

Eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon added a nice crisp to the sandwich. The potatoes were cooked to perfection. It had a rosemary kind of flavor. Crispy on the outside. Very delicious. I also got to try the lemon ricotta pancake. Oh man, that was soo good! Fluffy and light with a hint of lemon flavor. Loved how the lemon flavor wasn't too overwhelming. Definitely a must order!

The server seated me on the counter facing the kitchen, so I had a perfect view of the kitchen. \n\nI ordered the Plow, which consists of 2 eggs, 2 lemon riccota pancakes, their house potatoes, and choice of protein-chicken apple sausages, Nueske's bacon, or house pork sausages. I opted for the pork sausages based on the server's recommendations and ordered a cup of their Equator coffee to pair off with my meal. I don't know if it's the coffee fiend in me, but their cup of joe was addicting. I may have had a total of 4 cups.\n\nThe meal was real hearty leaving me stuffed. The house potatoes were nice and crispy seasoned with what tasted like rosemary. The lemon riccota pancakes were nice and fluffy with just the perfect amount of lemon flavoring. Initially I ordered for over-medium eggs so the yolk doesn't run throughout my plate but instead was served over-easy and a bit salty. I typically refrain from using condiments so I can savor the flavor of the dish, but their pork sausage was a tad dry, overcooked, and overly seasoned with herbs that ketchup helped neutralize the taste.\n\nAs I was wrapping up my meal, the chef also pulled out a fresh mochi cake from the oven and of course I couldn't resist, so I decided to order a slice to go. The cake reminded me of a Filipino bibingka cake. It has a spongy and gelatinous texture with a coconut after-taste. Very delicious especially when warm. \n\nPlow is perfect for splurging on breakfast. Personal advice is to come early because they do get packed and of course for the owners to add bottomless mimosas to their menu- one can only dream.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The Plow was awesome and now I'm craving lemon ricotta pancakes.

We went for a stroll across the street to grab some coffee and toast while we waited, but I saw others order coffee and mimosas from Plow while waiting. The staff seemed super nice and accommodating, considering how busy it was.\n\nWe finally got seated after about an hour and 15 mins. We both ordered The Plow, which comes with eggs, lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, and your choice of pork sausage/bacon/chicken apple sausage. I went with the classic bacon option while my friend opted for the pork sausage.\n\nBeing seated outside, I noticed that we were not given a jug of water that we could use to fill our own glasses, while people sitting inside were. It didn't matter too much because our waitress was pretty good about refilling our waters. Just wish they kept it consistent with the tables, though.\n\nOnto the food... Honestly I was very disappointed. My over medium eggs came with a perfect runny yolk (yay!) but overall were extremely bland. They tasted like they were barely seasoned with any salt or pepper. The bacon was terrible. It was waaay too salty and was not crispy at all. It was actually pretty soggy. The lemon ricotta pancakes and potatoes, on the other hand, were the redeeming factors of the dish. The pancakes were fluffy and had a good balance of lemon flavor. The potatoes were pretty good as well, but not remarkable enough for me to say they were amazing. I tried some of my friend's pork sausage and thought it was pretty average. The worst part was when I found a piece of hair at the bottom of my plate. Definitely know it's not my own since it was short and black instead of long and ombr\u00e9.

I'm not sure if they print the menu everyday, but I sure hope not because that would be such a waste of paper.\n\nOverall, Plow was definitely overhyped. It wasn't worth it to me to wait 1+ hour and pay $17 for a mediocre plate of food that had a hair in it... But maybe I just had a bad experience?

Plow is a weekday and weekend breakfast and brunch eatery.  The restaurant is small and casual though the d\u00e9cor is nicely done featuring homey but still contemporary notes.  The counter is nice and provides an excellent view of the short order counter where the team of chefs here efficiently crank out breakfast dishes like a well-run greasy spoon.\n\nThe food at Plow is not greasy spoon staples though.  You will see more upscale ingredients here like prosciutto and frisee as well as some great looking bread from a prestigious San Francisco bakery.  I had The Plow, which is their signature breakfast plate.  It is a hearty plate featuring two eggs, crispy fried potatoes with onions, choice of meat (chicken apple sausage, pork sausage patties or bacon), and two lemon ricotta pancakes.\n\nWith the exception of the lemon ricotta pancakes, this breakfast veered more towards fairly classic interpretations.  I had the eggs sunny side up, and they were quite good.  I would have liked the egg yolk a little less done, but the flavor was great.  The crispy potatoes were quite delicious.  The caramelized onions provided a mild sweet flavor while the potatoes combined a satisfying crispy exterior with a hot and soft center.  I also had their bacon, which was Nueske's bacon, a popular Midwestern bacon from Wisconsin.  The bacon had a smoky flavor as well as an appetizing pork flavor from the crispy fat.\n\nThe bacon was not as thick as Niman Ranch bacon, but the flavor was definitely memorable.  I also ordered their pork sausage patties, and these were good though I probably did prefer the bacon.  The center of the sausage was moist while the outside was well seared and crispy.  They get a little more adventurous with the seasoning so you get more herb and fennel notes with their sausage than you would experience at most breakfast spots.\n\nThe kitchen gussied up the pancakes a little more than they did with the other breakfast items in The Plow.  The pancakes featured both lemon and ricotta.  The lemon was nice.  It provided a noticeable lemon flavor as well as a lot of freshness.  I felt though that the ricotta probably hurt the pancake more than it helped it.  The pancakes had a great color and the smell of the pancake was very inviting.  Unfortunately, the pancake could have been sweeter.  The center was also a tad on the dry side and did not have that light and fluffy cake-like texture you would expect in an excellent pancake.\n\nService was fairly quick given how busy this restaurant gets (even on weekdays).  Prices are higher than your standard breakfast spot, but the ingredients at Plow are definitely high quality and the portions are surprisingly generous.\n\nI enjoyed The Plow at Plow though I felt the savory items were far superior to the disappointing lemon ricotta pancakes.

The eggs were cooked perfectly (over medium is not really a thing so basically over easy). However the pork sausage was a huge letdown as it was very dry and had whole cumin seeds in it. It was remediable with dashes of Youk's hot sauce, but it was really just tough and dry. I had a bite of my friend's fried egg sandwich with avocado and it was stellar (though this is something rather difficult to not succeed in). The camellia iced tea was blase but refreshing.\n\nService was wonderful and our waters and teas were refilled regularly. I was a little miffed because the self serve coffee was ~$4 and there was no real sign or warning from the hostess who merely said \"help yourself.\" I guess it is San Francisco and people no longer bat an eye at a $4 cup of coffee.

I was in for a treat. one of the best pork chops I have eaten. Tasted great, great cook on it and prefect sear on both side. loved every bite of it. \n\nLemon ricotta pancakes - got a side order of it. they were fluffy buttery and delicious, but i am more of a savory kinda guy so if you got a sweet tooth this is a must. \n\nThere is a reason for the long lines, but if you wait you will be rewarded and the reward tastes oh so delicious.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-22"}, {"excerpts": ["First time I had The Plow breakfast.  "], "author": "Michael M.", "review": "The place to see, be seen, be seen eating.\n\nI've been having a bit of fun trying to find new places to go in my new found freedom, to no fault of my own.  I've taken the cue from a few other people and tried to get here early.  I arrived before 8:30 am during the week to a nearly empty restaurant, and by the time I was finished less than an hour later all the seats were taken. So get here early.  Time went quickly, as I sat at the counter, dining solo, and enjoyed watching the chefs do their thing.\n\nFirst time I had The Plow breakfast.  This comes with 2 eggs your way, choice of protein, Plow potatoes,  and 2 lemon ricotta pancakes.  I like my eggs over hard, so that way I know I will get fresh cracked eggs.  I did not notice if the eggs for scrambled eggs or omelets come from a ladle.  I chose chicken apple sausage.  Everything was very good.  The lemon ricotta pancakes do not need any of the accompanying maple syrup and are light, and the lemon brings it together.  The potatoes are first boiled, lightly smashed, then deep fried and tossed with a few herbs and fewer onions that do not overpower.  Quite possibly the best breakfast potatoes I've had.  They pale in comparison to the undercooked potatoes from Crepevine, but that's another review.\n\nThe second time I had a simple two egg breakfast with house made pork sausage and a buttermilk biscuit.  This was an equally good choice, but I would choose the pork over both the chicken sausage and bacon, for the simple reason that the pork is house made, the bacon and chicken sausage are not.   Some of the coffee cakes and biscuits are only available until they are all gone, so it's a good idea to grab it while you can.  Same for the Chinese Breakfast,  which I want to try next ... pork shoulder with chili garlic ginger sauce, 2 fried eggs and rice.  It sounds so perfect. \n\nService is friendly and efficient.  Sitting at the counter I saw the servers correct the plates several times when the order was incorrect.  \n\nCoffee is provided by Equator, if I recall.  This place is worth getting up early for ... of course I'm up early every day whether I want to or not.  The only negative was the provided hot sauce ... it was not as spicy as I normally like on my eggs.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-05-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We had house made granola, lemon ricotta pancakes and the plow.."], "author": "Suzane S.", "review": "I really love this place.

Yes, there's a lot of hype...yes, there will be a wait...yes, there will probably be several tourists trying out the spot.  Typically, this will sway me away from any place, but after seeing all the pictures, reading all the reviews, and also hearing from several of my SF friends how delicious it was, I ponied up and decided to make my way there.  \n\nMy husband and I opted to try it out over the 4th of July weekend on a Friday mid-day, hoping to avoid the Saturday/Sunday brunch crowd.  We just prepared ourselves for a long wait - we ended up getting there around 12:30PM or so, and I think we waited for about an hour, which isn't bad.  My husband grabbed a beer as we waited, and I popped in to one of the boutique stores just up the block to browse/bum time.\n\nWhen I was browsing at the store, I asked the store owner what she recommended at Plow.  She started off by highly recommending the \"Plow\" plate to get a sampling of all their stuff, said to (\"whatever you do\") get the baked good of the day if they aren't sold out, and then proceeded to pretty much list off every item they offered.  Pretty much, I knew right then and there that Plow would be a repeat brunch spot ;)\n\nEverything we tried was excellent - every item blew my mind.  You can tell that every ingredient they use is high quality, in season, and fresh.  The eggs, for example - the yolks are bright orange, and whites so fluffy.  I learned that they buy their eggs from a local organic egg farmer in Napa - always delivered fresh.  \n\nWhile we wanted to try everything on the menu, we tried:\n\nThe Plow (two lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs any style, choice of pork sausage/chicken sausage/bacon, crispy potatoes) *****5 stars*****- We decided to share the Plow so we could try a bunch of the stuff they offered.  We selected the pork sausage per recommendation of the waitress and poached eggs.  I can't even pick which item was my favorite - everything was so perfectly done and went so well together.

The lemon ricotta pancakes were the BEST pancakes ever, ever, ever, ever.  I will be getting these (at least as a \"side\") every single time.  Holy crap, so good.\n\nBanana Bread - *****4.5 stars***** One of the \"baked goods of the day\" - We thought it would be a bit much with everything else we were ordering, but since we received the recommendation to order \"whatever baked good they are offering\" we decided to go ahead.  We figured, \"well we can bring any left overs home.\"  Uhhhh, let's just say, there were no leftovers.  SO delicious; came out warm, had a crispy crust of sugar coating the top, had chunks of gooey bananas throughout, and buttery flavor.  Mmmm...\n\nLittle Gem Salad - *****5 stars ****** To balance out some of the savory of our meal, I decided to order a little gem salad.  I was expecting nothing special, but even the salad surprised me!  The dressing was amazing; fresh and tasty.  All ingredients were fresh, seasonal, and balanced everything nicely.  I wish I could get this salad for lunch every day!\n\nBubbles/Beer - We also opted to make it a true brunch and ordered some adult beverages.  Decent selection of beers and wine.  If a cup of joe is more your cup of tea ;) - I heard that their coffee (even their decaf) is excellent.\n\nOverall - this place is brunch/lunch perfection.  I am SO happy we're a quick walk to this place.  We will DEFINITELY be back many, many, more times.

They're perfectly salted and seasoned with fragrant rosemary. Hands down, the BEST brunch potatoes in the city!\n\nOf course the potatoes aren't the only selling point for me. The popular lemon ricotta pancakes have a refreshingly light kick from the zest and are balanced out by the creamier texture of the ricotta cheese. They're definitely on the denser side, so if you're a fluffy pancake fan, these may not be for you.\n\nThey have a relatively small, but well-rounded menu that contains favorites such as the fried egg sandwich, smoked salmon eggs benedict, and corned beef hash. If it's your first time here, or for me the first 3 times, \"The Plow\" is the way to go! For $16 you get a nice sampling of two lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs, a mound of heavenly potatoes, and your choice of bacon, or pork or chicken apple sausage.\n\nThey unexpectedly play throwback 90's R&B music all the time and I like the feel of their open kitchen and large glass windows that let in lots of natural light to help brighten your brunchy morning. The service is pretty average here. You're lucky if you get checked on once since they're busy running around all the time. They give you a pitcher of water though so refills are no problem. \n\nExpect an average wait of 1.5 hours, but if you're willing to wait until the early afternoon, you can arrive at 1:30 and only wait about a half hour since they stop taking names at 2pm. They can't accommodate parties of 6 or more due to their small size and they don't take reservations. Benches and a beautiful view of Mission Bay are available while you wait and parking isn't too bad. Plow continues to be one of my top brunch spots in the city.

This may be because the food is delicious. It is equally possible you know them only for their ridiculous wait times (a problem that has become emblematic of any metropolitan area with a love of basic, bougie, boozy brunch). \n\nBrief summary of why the food is great. Any Google search will yield that it is \"comfort\" and \"rustic style.\" What this means in practice is an almost southern amount of decadence with all of the artisanal perks of any bay area establishment. You have your all inclusive brunch platter called \"The Plow.\" But the menu also has chia seed pudding and a plate of gluten free, almond flour pancakes. \n\nMore on The Plow. It's probably the best option on the menu, especially for a first timer. Eggs are prepared to your liking, and you get the choice between pork sausage, chicken apple sausage, and bacon. However the main attractions are the potatoes (so popular they are named \"plow potatoes\"). These little guys are perfectly crispy on the outside but ultimately melt on your tongue. Anyone on a diet--please evacuate immediately. To add insult to carbaphobic injury, the lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. They are smaller than you'd expect, which is both a curse and a blessing.\n\nThe great food isn't the only reason this place is so busy. The interior of the restaurant is tiny, as if it is trying to spite you and your hungry stomach. There is ample outdoor seating for those who are waiting to be seated, but I'd also recommend exploring the surrounding area, or even walking all the way to the Mission, like one Yelper did. You will literally have enough time to walk several miles and back (if you can bear the hill, that is). Especially if you're trying to score brunch on a Sunday (but why would you do that to yourself). Alternatively, ordering a grapefruit mimosa is another good way to kill time.\n\nIf you plan on wandering--which I highly suggest--make sure you call them periodically or come back by the suggested time. When they invite people to come in, they do not call said people on the phone. If you aren't there, your spot is lost to the next people in line. I'm pretty sure they do this on purpose as a form of line management. Every time someone is called and doesn't show up, everyone waiting outside cheers.\n\nI only eat here once a year, because that's about how long it takes for me to no longer feel disenchanted by the wait time.

They're lemony without tasting like dishwash detergent and the ricotta isn't too heavy. They're dense and fluffy at the same time, with a mousse-like consistency. And they're good enough on their own that the side of pure maple syrup, served in the most adorable little dispenser, isn't necessary. I'm not a big fan of pancakes, yet I'd be willing to order a full serving of these amazing lemon ricotta pancakes next time!\n\nI also love Plow's crispy potatoes. Every time I'm given a choice between side salad or side potatoes, I always opt for salad to be \"healthier\". Plow only offers potatoes. But I'm glad that's my only option or else I'd feel more guilty for not eating my veggies. The potatoes are so crispy! They're packed with flavor and I love the generous amount of dried rosemary used to season these carb-loaded tubers.\n\nI recommend \"The Plow\" -- two lemon ricotta pancakes, crispy potatoes, two eggs (any style), and a choice of bacon, house pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage. This dish is huge, very satisfying, and has variety. You'll unbuckle your belt and roll down the hill after you've devoured everything and licked the plate clean.\n\nThe Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon is also tasty. The muffins are too thick and too large, proportionally, compared to the salmon and eggs. The salmon is salty and flavorful, and it pairs nicely with the beautifully poached, ooey-gooey runny eggs. \n\nOur host was extremely friendly and our waitress was nice, but service was poorly timed. It took a few minutes before we got our water and for her to take our orders. We arrived at 1PM on a Saturday and were seated outside within 30 minutes (inside would've taken at least another 10 minutes).

"], "author": "Courtney K.", "review": "Bottom Line:  The food is delicious, the interior is cute and the service is friendly, but I don't think I'd typically wait more than 30 minutes to eat here.\n\nMy friend lives two block from Plow so as foodies and elite Yelpers, we had to give it a try.  If you are thinking about venturing to Potrero Hill yourself, here is some information that I hope will help you decide if Plow is worth the trip and the wait:\n\n- The Wait.  My take away from reading many Yelp reviews is that the wait runs one to two hours.  I really can't imagine waiting that long and luckily I didn't have to.  I arrived a few minutes before 8am on a Saturday and only waited about ten minutes for a party of two.  Since the restaurant doesn't open until 8am on Saturday, and we were able to get in on the first seating, we only had to wait long enough for the hostess to get to us.  It helped immensely that there were only two of us.  \n\n- Size Does Matter.  Plow is small and if your party is big, Plow won't be a good fit for you.  My recollection is that there are a handful of four-top tables but not many bigger options.  In fact, there website says they can only accommodate parties of six or less.  If you have a small party and want to sit at the counter, you can probably get seated faster.  And if you are a party of one, don't let the wait deter you, because you can probably snag a seat at the counter rather quickly.  \n\n- Food.  The food here is really good but not so good that I'd wait hours for it.  I do like how fresh their ingredients are and the uniqueness of some of their items.  You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients they use and I fully appreciate their efforts to source their ingredients locally.  Also, they make many items, like their ricotta and pork sausage in house.   Because I was starving, we (and by \"we,\" I mean \"I\") ordered lots of food.  \n\n   - Breakfast Dessert!: We were seated at the counter overlooking the freshly baked breakfast desserts so of course I had to order the chocolate chip walnut coffee cake to start.  That probably isn't the right name for it, but just know those breakfast desserts are good!\n\n   - Eggs Benny:  Plow's rendition of the classic Eggs Benedict was wonderful.  I did it with the Fra' Mani ham (Fra' Mani is a fancy pork company out of Berkley that sells its products wholesale and to Costco).\n\n   - The Plow:  Probably the most popular dish on the menu, my friend went with the Plow.  She started it and I finished it!  (Hey, I said I was starving.)  Even though I am not much of a breakfast potato person, I thought Plow's crispy potatoes were delicious and I ate way more of those potatoes than I would anyone else's breakfast potatoes!  I also really enjoyed the sausage.  I am sure it helped that I had been in town for a vegetarian wedding all weekend and was craving meat like a cave man.  The homemade pork sausage had great texture and flavor.  For me, the lemon ricotta pancakes weren't worth the hype.  They were good, and I like the unique combination, but they didn't wow me.  Nevertheless, I think Plow makes their own ricotta which is very cool and admirable.      \n\n- Service.  Service was friendly an attentive.  Despite a line out the door, the staff remains calm and keeps on plowing through the service.  I also like that they kept my coffee full and didn't rush us out of there.  \n\n- The ambiance is very cute and the d\u00e9cor is well done - hardwood floors, marble counter top, big windows and an open kitchen.  \n\n- Extras.  Plow is a very cute, cohesive, well-thought-out place.  They also have a great, classy web site.  I can tell the owners put a lot of love and pride into this business and for that I applaud them!", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-02-18"}, {"excerpts": ["We had time to look at our menus and I decided on the Plow with pork sausage and poached eggs.

I know that it was a weekday morning and Christmas eve, but still, that's pretty amazing.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this place was that the tables were pretty close together.

I did not mind this all too much, since the people sitting next to us were super friendly. \n\nNow, the food/drink. I got the coffee while my friend got the 12-hour cold brewed iced coffee.

It is just their breakfast platter with a little bit of everything. On my numerous trips back to this place, I also tried the fried egg sandwich (4/5) and their crab scramble (3/5). \n\nThe plow is basically the most amazing breakfast platter you will ever eat. It comes with a heaping pile of potatoes (5/5). The potatoes aren't your average hash brown or the soggy potatoes that come with a diner breakfast. These potatoes are super crispy and brown on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. You can hear the crunch as you bite down. You also have the option of bacon (4/5) or sausage (5/5). You really can't go wrong with either option. Their chicken apple sausage is the perfect amount of sweetness and savory. The bacon is fatty and rich. My only qualm is that the bacon is a little limp If you're really feeling hungry, get both! Why not! Also, with the plate comes the standard 2 eggs any way you like, I personally prefer them poached soft so you can dip the crispy potatoes and meat in the runny yolk. Finally, to top it all off, are 2 lemon ricotta pancakes (6/5). These pancakes are not your average fluffy pancake. They are slightly denser, but packed full of flavor. I'll be honest, I'm not a pancake person normally. Waffles win it all for me, but when it comes to these lemon ricotta pancakes, I would eat a hundred if I could. \n\nAs for the egg sandwich, they fry the egg to perfection. Yolk is perfectly runny, acting as a great sauce for the sandwich. The only reason this got a 4/5 in my book was due to the fact it really needed the addition of some meat. If you do get this sandwich, spend the extra couple bucks to add in some of that delicious bacon they have. Trust me, it'll take the sandwich to the next level. \n\nThe crab scramble had way too many green onions for my liking (I personally hate them and will pick them out given the chance, but this had way too many to do so). It covered up the taste of the crab a bit. There were large hunks of crab throughout the omelet which is great, but there were quite a few pieces of shells too, which made it a bit annoying to eat.\n\nAmazing food, great service - nothing more you could ask for.\n\nCons: \n- long wait on weekends and in the mornings \n- restaurant is small, so if you sit on the patio, it does get very cold\n\nPros: \n- brunch food here is A+ - everything is cooked to perfection\n- service is fast and friendly", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-11-30"}, {"excerpts": ["We came here for breakfast and although it was hard to order anything but \"the plow\" (basic breakfast with their signature ricotta & lemon pancakes), we also opted for the little gem salad to counter balance the bacon.

Like others, I was more than willing to wait a half hour for an outstanding breakfast -- but this was far from outstanding.\n\nFirst of all, the meals are a heart attack on a plate -- everything seems to be deep fried or cooked in vegetable oil (we sat at the bar, so we could see everything as it was cooked). My two friends got the Plow, which was two pancakes, eggs, breakfast meat, and toast. I ordered two eggs and the chicken apple sausage and toast.\n\nThe pancakes were, as others have written, delicious. The lemon flavoring makes them feel lighter than they are. The eggs were completely flavorless; my guess is that cooking with oil was behind this, rather than butter. I even had them add some cheese; what they added appeared on one side of the scramble but I didn't see cheese throughout.\n\nThe potatoes were delicious -- dude. Deep. Fried. How can they not be? Crispy and good. The toast was either a sour dough or almost Italian type bread which, when toasted, was hard to chew. The apple sausage was good, but not particularly memorable. For drinks, we ordered coffee and tea; they were happy with their coffee, my tea didn't stay very warm in the individual pot that was brought to the table.\n\nIn the end, if you do choose to go here, keep in mind that the portions are HUGE -- so perhaps share with someone at your table. I ate maybe a third of the eggs, 2 out of 4 of the sausage links, both small slices of toast, and maybe 1/2 the potatoes and left feeling very fool.

Parking was easy (no meter), we were seated right away (rare moment), and the service/ambiance screamed brunch, what more could you ask for.

I've been reading about restaurants scamming their customers a lot lately down in Santa Ana, so I was extra careful to check the tab.

I didn't think to check the distance (1.6 miles); it seemed so close on the map. It's not that a 32-minute walk wasn't good for me (I totally earned my breakfast, not), it's the unsavory characters that you encounter. So, don't do what I did. However, the meal was worth the trouble!\n\nWe arrived around 9:30 on a Tuesday and it was much busier than I expected. Fortunately not busy enough that we had to wait because thankfully, there were two seats available at the bar. Some helpful notes: they will not seat you unless your entire party is present. Even if it is just one other person. No exceptions. Also, there's only 6-7 seats at the bar and roughly seven tables (very small space). There are a couple tables for outside dining as well.\n\nOwner/Chef Maxine Siu was directly in front of us busily preparing dishes in their small partially-open kitchen. She was careful not to make eye contact with any patrons. Totally understandable, but it would have been so much fun to talk food. \n\nRuben started with a cup of Equator Coffee ($3.50) and we shared a Cinnamon Brioche ($4). It was a delicious rendition of a cinnamon roll and the center was perfectly gooey and flavorful. I selected The Plow ($16) with sunny side-up eggs, housemade pork sausage, two Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and crispy potatoes. The sausage was nice, but dry. Not my favorite sausage. Though the crispy potatoes were lovely and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were perfect! Ruben had the Fried Egg Sandwich with Nueske Bacon ($13.50), two soft fried eggs, aioli, cheddar, and fris\u00e9e on an Acme bun. This was also tasty with the addition of the \"Food's Best Friend Lucky Dog\" hot fire-roasted pepper sauce.\n\nOur server was really friendly and everyone was very pleasant. We didn't loiter much since there were several people waiting, but it's a nice setting to hang out and catch up with friends. The decor is fun with many pigs around!

Was intending to get there by 9:45am but lagged myself until 10:30a (oops, darn DST lol). I was almost dropped off to get our names on the list but I rushed out my house blind (without contacts on) so we had to go find parking first (again, oops lol). Good thing parking was easy to find! We got a spot right around the corner and then the hour wait commenced...\n\nWe were seated at the bar, which I love because of the open kitchen, and this is how I learned that:\n[+] pork sausages are uncooked, hand-formed and cooked only when ordered\n[+/-] chicken-apple sausages are cooked a bit and \"reheated\"/\"recooked\"\n[-] bacon is cooked beforehand, sits in an open metal pan, and simply \"reheated\" on the flat top griddle (albeit it is most efficient this way, considering how busy it is here)\n[+] everything else is cooked only when ordered\n[+] the cooks have a very organized system so, props to those guys!\n\nTHE PLOW ($16)\n[+/-] Lemon ricotta pancakes (2 small) were very good in some bites (depending on where the ricotta is), but it was a bit dry overall and had a very faint lemon flavor. I usually don't use syrup with my pancakes but for this, I had to dip a bit to add some sweetness to it.\n[+] Potatoes were on point. I love the crispy, herby tastes and it was not overly salty either.\n[+] Chicken-apple sausages (4 links) were very enjoyable and did not taste overcooked from the \"recooking\"\n[+/-] Eggs are made to your liking\n\nCORNED BEEF HASH ($15)\n[-] Yes, it comes with potatoes but it is NOT their signature crispy, herby goodness! You've been warned.\n[+] Corned beef was corned beef. Good and thinly-sliced.\n[+/-] Comes with 2 slices of lightly-toasted rustic loaf\n[+/-] Eggs are made to your liking\n\nSERVICE\n[-] Took a while to get our waters after we were seated\n[-] Waitress/server totally forgot I asked for a box, even after giving us our check\n[+/-] Was never asked how we were doing, but maybe because we were at the bar?\n\nWe finished our meal around 12:30pm and there was STILL a long wait. I don't know how people wait so long for this place! It's good but I'm not blown away. If I'm going to wake up early and wait at least an hour for food, I expect nothing less than awesome.

Yesterday morning though, we both woke up early and decided to try our luck.  Parking was pretty easy as we got a space across the street. We arrived about 5 minutes or so after opening and got seated at the last table, which we shared with a couple that got in right before us.  Of course I was afraid that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but it did!  7x7 released a few months ago the recipe for Plow's lemon ricotta pancakes and I took a stab at making them.  So, naturally I had to get The Plow ($16) & he instantly gravitated towards the Dungeness crab scramble ($17).  The waitress was coming around asking if we wanted coffee with her big pitcher.  Bf said yes and I declined since I'm so picky with coffee.  However, he (usually drinks black) and I (usually gets vanilla lattes and macchiatos) thought the coffee was quite good even with just a little bit of sugar, it was pretty mild.  The coffee was Equator.  \n\nThe Plow is two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, house potatoes and your choice of bacon, housemade pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage.

The creme fraiche was the perfect addition for the scramble.  He loved the house potatoes which was served with his meal too.  The toast it was served with was standard though.  As for my Plow: The eggs, which I chose over easy were perfectly cooked and the yolk just oozed all over once punctured.  The house potatoes were so crispy.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy, moist, and lemony; they were to die for.  The only thing that killed the breakfast was the sausage.  We were surprised that they were made into patties, and it did have some nice seasoning but they were so dry.  We had to dip the pieces into the egg yolk or pour syrup on them.  Perhaps they didn't put any fat in it and that's why it was so dry?  The dry sausage was really the only thing that killed the breakfast and prevented us from deeming Plow a 5 star breakfast.  \n\nOkay, I think even by SF standards the dishes are a little pricey for breakfast, but they're so worth it.  I'm gonna say a little gripe though, what I don't get is that, they offer free cups of coffee (refills too) for those stuck waiting for a table outside, but will ask around patrons dining if they'd like a cup...thought it may have been free, but was surprised to see the $3.50 charge on the receipt.  Bf was more optimistic than me though (even though he paid) and said, \"Well at least they kept filling me up.  Not all places give free refills.\"  Plow is a solid 4.5 stars.

I asked to confirm if mine had bacon, because that's what I had ordered. She rudely replied \"your food is coming soon\" and left without confirming what I had ordered. She could have just said yes and left it at that??? I didn't ask how long my food was taking, nor did I care about how long it would take... \n3) During the meal, our server did not check on us (or anyone for that matter) to see if we needed water or anything, not even once throughout the meal. \n4) When our server came by the tables I asked her \"excuse me, may I please have the check?\" She ignored me and continued to scan the tables in the area without approaching any of them.

"], "author": "Tone C.", "review": "Plow has been on my list of \"must try restaurants\" for awhile.  Today when hubby and I were near the area, we decided to stop in.  Little did I know it was going to be a royal waste of time!  We showed up at 1:00 on a Saturday and were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes for 2 of us.  So frustrating to see people streaming out and several four tops (arriving after us) getting seated before us.  Problem is:  the very small restaurant is made up of mostly of four tops - so parties of 4 get priority seating.  At 50 minutes, I seriously considered cutting bait but we had come so far so we persevered, pushing past the pangs of hunger and our near-frozen fingers and toes. Had we been given an accurate estimate of the hour wait time, we would've gone elsewhere.  Like, Chez Maman - close by and has never disappointed.  \n\nAn hour later, we were finally seated at the counter.  Our server showed up almost immediately to take our drink order but took awhile to come back for our food order.  After I made eye contact with her twice (once she mouthed \"I'll be right there\"), she finally came back.  Hubby had The Plow and when I ordered the eggs benedict, I was told, \"Oh, we're sold out.  We JUST sold the last one.  Literally a minute ago.\"  Really?!?  Way to add insult to injury.  We waited an hour in the cold wind, you took your sweet time with our food order and now you tell me that I just missed the last plate of eggs benedict by ONE minute?!?  Had she been more timely and efficient and showed up a minute earlier, I wouldn't have missed it.  Argh!\n\nUnfortunately, the food wasn't good enough to rid the bad taste in my mouth I got from the wait and the couldn't-care-less attitude of the staff.  Though the food is better than average, it is in NO WAY worth the hour wait (or 2 hours for some other Yelpers who seem to have much more fortitude than I).  \n\nI won't be going back unless they start taking reservations and upping the batch of hollandaise they make.  It's a head-scratcher for sure - they had plenty of eggs, ham/spinach/smoked salmon and english muffins (I had a side order, in fact) but they couldn't serve me eggs benedict?!?  I can only guess that they ran out of hollandaise.  How hard is it to make extra hollandaise?  Apparently this outage is a frequent occurrence - so why hasn't Plow addressed this?  Dear Plow:  Make extra hollandaise.  It doesn't cost much and you'll more than make up the cost of any potentially wasted hollandaise in the extra plates you sell.\n\nDon't get sucked into the hype.  I wouldn't recommend going to Plow but if you absolutely must, then 1) go on a weekday, 2) go with a party of four and 3) make sure you place your order of eggs benedict ASAP (before you do anything else!).", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-01-26"}, {"excerpts": ["I've ordered the plow which is your standard eggs, house potatoes bacon toast ", "and it's soooo good!!!!

The host told us the wait for 2 was easily an hour. Expecting that, we put our names down and headed around the neighborhood to scope it out while we waited (and Potrero Hill is very cute I might add). We came back exactly an hour later and were seated inside. The spot is super cute but it's also very small which totally explains why the wait is always so long. We both already knew we wanted the Plow (little bit of everything!) and got the buttered bread and homemade preserves as a starter.

I guess it's meant to be only for one. \n\nAnyways, another good thing was that the food came out relatively fast. Here's my breakdown on each of the parts of the dish:\n- Eggs: MIND blowing for SURE. You could tell in an instant that these eggs were farm fresh and organic. I loved them.\n- Chicken apple sausage: Very average IMO. The nice thing was that they got our dishes mixed up and actually brought both of us bacon but when we told them they brought us five sausages each -- which was more than enough!\n- Bacon: Super average. Sweet Maple's is 100X better.\n- Country potatoes: Definitely good but I thought they were a little too fried. They could have been just regular potatoes and still been just as good without being overly crispy. But I still enjoyed!\n- Pancakes: Good too but I was super sad to realize they didn't blow my mind. Now just a disclaimer -- if you like anything lemony then you will LOVE this -- because the texture is bomb, the portion is perfect, and the consistency is great (not too dry, not too soppy). But sadly I'm just really not a lemon person (never been into any lemony desserts either), but I LOVE my pancakes. So I enjoyed these but I wasn't blown away. My friend on the other hand loved them. I also should have known I probably wouldn't be obsessed, but my friends had told you could barely taste the lemon (which is not true). \n\nAll in all, excellent dining experience, ambiance, and service. You could tell the food was fresh too -- but I just wasn't blown away which is what I expected from a place with Plow's reputation. Not to say that's bad, I think a solid 4 is awesome, but I'm always in search of a 5 for brunching because I'm such a tough critic with it. (Olea still has my heart at #1).

I live a couple houses up and ride my bike past the restaurant every day. There is always some kind of line outside the restaurant, even on weekdays! Good for them! However, that means I just haven't been in awhile because waiting in the line sucks.\n\nAnyways, I went yesterday (Sunday) for brunch. Was quite disappointed in both the food and service we received at Plow. \n\n1) I ordered a duck and sweet potato hash. Sounds amazing, right? Well, the duck was fatty and flavorless. Quite gamey but not in a good way. I kept on having to add ketchup and hot sauce because it just tasted like someone had taken cubed duck breast and boiled it. There was no caramelization, no nice tasty brown spots on the meat. There were also fatty chunks on the meat that weren't rendered properly, like poorly cooked pork belly.  All of it was a dull brown-gray. The sweet potatoes fared no better. They were overcooked and disintegrated fairly quickly. I was super hungry and ate 2/3s of it, but ended picking at my friend's meals (they all got the Plow) to fill up.\n\n2) The service! It's gotten so snobby! The blonde girl who served us (we were sitting outside) really needs to consider the fact that she's at a BREAKFAST joint, not a Michelin starred restaurant. Two incidents. First, my friend asked if they had brown sugar. He just likes the extra richness. She says, \"We don't have brown sugar, we have RAW sugar\" in a tone that basically said \"how dare you ask for brown sugar when we have this organic local better-than-you sugar here already\". Second incident, another friend asked for goat cheese instead of cheddar on her fried egg sandwich. She makes a face and says \"well, I'll get that for you on the side because it probably won't taste good.\" Girl, have you even had goat cheese on eggs and frisee? It tastes FINE. Delicious, even! I understand if we were at a fine dining establishment, and the dish has specific ingredients that were meant to go together, but for fucks sake, we just want to switch out the cheese. \n\nBottom line, probably not coming here very often anymore, especially since the wait is a huge turn off. It's expensive too, I spent $20+ on just my dish (no coffee, no extras).

That wait will get you a single table for 2 if you're lucky, or perhaps a seat at a table of 4 (typically shared with other people if your party is fewer than 4 people) or at the bar.  If you show up after 10:30am on a weekend, be prepared to wait a while ... with limited breakfast / brunch options nearby if you decide that you can't stand the wait.

Their menu changes weekly, so come back often. The boast fresh organic produce from local farms, which is the norm in San Francisco, but not the standard.\n\nTheir french toast is crunchy outside with a custard-like creaminess inside, delicately sweet and garnished with fresh berries and a brulee'd banana. Served with subtle sweet Vermont syrup (not too sweet, not too thick, just perfect syrup). \n\nLemon ricotta pancakes is my favorite and it's one of the reasons I keep coming back. I have convinced many patrons to try their lemon ricotta pancakes when I brunch here. They are dense with pockets filled with ricotta (a light cheese, similar to mozzarella) and a subtle lemon flavor. I've tried to replicate their lemon-ricotta pancakes and while my pancakes can be similar in taste, they do not have the same thick, rich and hearty elements that Plow creates.\n\nThe eggs benedict are okay. The star of the dish is the hollandaise sauce which I feel is too zesty.  Most holllandaise sauce has a mild creamy flavor with subtle tang, however Plow's hollandaise sauce has a robust tang that overpowers the other mildly flavored components. I suspect a heavy hand in lemon juice. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. \n\n\"The Plow\" is a good way to sample all of their good things (it comes with lemon ricotta pancakes -smaller version). The potatoes are tasty but their inconsistent size makes the large pieces stand out in buttery goodness and the tiny bits too burnt to eat. Their homemade sausages are a bit dry.

I think that it could have used more berries and less citrus fruits in my honest opinion. \n\nThe fried egg sandwich is okay. The nueske bacon makes it a tad better. The acme bun was lovely. Everything else was standard. \n\nThe dungenous crab scramble was tasty. It had hearty pieces of crab meat. Definitely a go to dish to try. But I think it's a bit pricey at $17. \n\nThe almond pancake was disappointing. I didn't taste any flavor of almond. But I suppose that it is a fan for gluten-free eaters. \n\nThe counter seating is quite small and can be uncomfortable, however that's where you get to see the magic of everything being cooked. I like sitting outside because it's quieter. Inside its warm and loud. \n\nPrice wise, I think it's expensive. IMO, I think that brunch should be $10 and under. Many of the dishes here can be made at home for the fraction of the price. The prices here $10-$17 per meal. Not including extra such as drinks or side dishes. The coffee alone is a whopping $3.75.\n\nOverall, I think that the food is prepared well and presented beautifully. I will return because think their lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious.

So I just stood there in the morning sun, waiting. Thinking about the case. Thinking about little details. Things I might have missed. Overlooked. Suspects. Locations. \nAnd then it struck me. That eureka moment delegated to only the greatest breakthroughs in modern science and medicine.  \nBy Toutatis. Of course!\nIt was here that they called my name and I promptly forgot about my epiphany. Plowed! You may think than an hour goes by quickly when solving mysteries, but my hot tip here is that even though they say it's an hour wait, it probably won't be. Most people don't hang around long enough so you sort of move up the list to get seated. \nI had a dish called The Plow at a place called Plow. It was a decent mix of eggs, amazing bacon (I need to go back and investigate the bacon), magical lemon ricotta pancakes (because it's 2012 and science figured out how to give us this boon to culture) and SWEET MENTAL TIDDLYWINKS THE POTATOES! \nOh golden crunchy potatoes, wherefor doth thou embrace my taste buds so?\nI took my sweet time finishing this meal and will come back soon.

I've taken the cue from a few other people and tried to get here early.  I arrived before 8:30 am during the week to a nearly empty restaurant, and by the time I was finished less than an hour later all the seats were taken. So get here early.  Time went quickly, as I sat at the counter, dining solo, and enjoyed watching the chefs do their thing.\n\nFirst time I had The Plow breakfast.  This comes with 2 eggs your way, choice of protein, Plow potatoes,  and 2 lemon ricotta pancakes.  I like my eggs over hard, so that way I know I will get fresh cracked eggs.  I did not notice if the eggs for scrambled eggs or omelets come from a ladle.  I chose chicken apple sausage.  Everything was very good.  The lemon ricotta pancakes do not need any of the accompanying maple syrup and are light, and the lemon brings it together.  The potatoes are first boiled, lightly smashed, then deep fried and tossed with a few herbs and fewer onions that do not overpower.  Quite possibly the best breakfast potatoes I've had.  They pale in comparison to the undercooked potatoes from Crepevine, but that's another review.\n\nThe second time I had a simple two egg breakfast with house made pork sausage and a buttermilk biscuit.  This was an equally good choice, but I would choose the pork over both the chicken sausage and bacon, for the simple reason that the pork is house made, the bacon and chicken sausage are not.   Some of the coffee cakes and biscuits are only available until they are all gone, so it's a good idea to grab it while you can.  Same for the Chinese Breakfast,  which I want to try next ... pork shoulder with chili garlic ginger sauce, 2 fried eggs and rice.  It sounds so perfect. \n\nService is friendly and efficient.  Sitting at the counter I saw the servers correct the plates several times when the order was incorrect.  \n\nCoffee is provided by Equator, if I recall.

The savory sausage gravy over perfected buttermilk biscuits...amazing! And of course the lemon ricotta pancakes and the plow potatoes that I have read so much about were better than I expected. I am very picky about home fries/hash browns, and often find most restaurants just miss the mark, but Plow's technique of cooking their potatoes ensures every bite is full of flavor. \n\nI can not say enough about my breakfast experience!!

If you go on a weekday there will probably be a wait as well, but it will be about 5-15 minutes.  \n\nMy personal favorite at Plow is their friend egg sandwich with potatoes on the side. Make sure to add avocado to your sandwich for an extra punch of flavor. Its so good I actually have dreams about it. In my dream, I eat about a hundred of them back to back without gaining an ounce of weight!  Love those dreams!

Actually, I've been hearing raves about Plow from friends, the blogs, and pretty much anybody who had been and weathered the wait for their tasty breakfasts. Truth be told, I am not enamored with Mission Beach Cafe or Boogaloos and didn't think that breakfast at Plow would wow me.\n\nThe breakfast wowed me. \n\nWe started with a corn and millet muffin, freshly baked and still warm from the oven. The muffin was crumbly and a bit hard to eat but the crust on the muffin top was crunchy and the millet added crispy bits to the slightly sweet corn muffin. Seriously though, all muffins should be eaten fresh and warm from the oven. \n\nNext up were a la carte orders of an almond pancake (gluten-free!) and a pumpkin pancake. The pumpkin pancake was fine, similar to what I make at home, but the almond pancake was really interesting. I didn't believe it was actually gluten-free at first b/c the texture was so spot on and it wasn't heavily almond flavored. I dislike marzipan, so I was quite pleased at the neutral flavor profile of the pancake. We asked the server and she informed us that it was made with almond, oat, and coconut flour. An excellent option for the g-f people out there.\n\nThe soft scrambled eggs were the turning point for me, where I switched from liking Plow to loving Plow. Of course we've all read about the proper way to slowly scramble eggs, slow and over low heat a la Julia Child or Jacques Pepin, and I thought I had it right before. I was wrong. These eggs were so, so silky. Not runny, but perfectly silky, highlighted by fava greens, chanterelles, and goat cheese. The much lauded crispy potatoes and some levain toast (well buttered with butter you could actually taste) were also there. I don't even like eggs and I kept going back to them, passing over the crispy fried potatoes!\n\nWe also tried the Chinese Breakfast whose name manages to simultaneously bring to mind my family and Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast. Anyway, of course you can't go wrong with gingery braised pork shoulder over rice, but the soft scrambled eggs are really where it's at.\n\nAll the ingredients used were obviously quality; seasoning levels and ingredient ratios were also well balanced. Loved the clean yet rustic vibe of the naturally sunny dining room. Also loved our server who understood that we were there to sample some different dishes vs eating at a traditional pace. She brought things out at a comfortable rate and was there to answer questions as needed.

I would deep fry the heck out of my home fries the way that the folks at Plow do.\n\nThey've also mastered the art of cooking fluffy eggs, complete with crispy edges and runny yolks. Lemon ricotta pancakes? Tart and complemented every bite of potato that came after. The housemade pork patties exploded with juice and delectable flavor, ever so slightly caramelized on the outside by the flattop. The bacon on the sandwich was pliant, but it was clear that finishing it off on the flat-top really did it crispy justice. And wow, I hate frisee in every mixed greens salad I eat, but the bitter vegetable actually went so well with the fluffy Acme bread, meat, and eggs.\n\nThe cinnamon roll was a 9/10 on the indie pastry scale. I found it a little bit dry, but it satisfied a month-long craving for gooey cinnamon buns and it was made quite well.\n\nService is very friendly here, and despite the hustle and bustle, I was impressed by their professionalism and their ability to work with each other in the kitchen. Cue cooks working together to plate a sandwich, with one guy handling all eggs and another one popping the buns right off the flattop. Plus, our water jug never ran low. If the weekend wait is as bad as it seems, I think I'd pop in on a weekday instead.

Back outside I go to chill, and I mean that in the sense of being cold. Somewhere in there I watch the hostess walk down the street and step directly in front of a (slowly, thank God) moving bus.

Plow is a weekday and weekend breakfast and brunch eatery.  The restaurant is small and casual though the d\u00e9cor is nicely done featuring homey but still contemporary notes.  The counter is nice and provides an excellent view of the short order counter where the team of chefs here efficiently crank out breakfast dishes like a well-run greasy spoon.\n\nThe food at Plow is not greasy spoon staples though.  You will see more upscale ingredients here like prosciutto and frisee as well as some great looking bread from a prestigious San Francisco bakery.  I had The Plow, which is their signature breakfast plate.  It is a hearty plate featuring two eggs, crispy fried potatoes with onions, choice of meat (chicken apple sausage, pork sausage patties or bacon), and two lemon ricotta pancakes.\n\nWith the exception of the lemon ricotta pancakes, this breakfast veered more towards fairly classic interpretations.  I had the eggs sunny side up, and they were quite good.  I would have liked the egg yolk a little less done, but the flavor was great.  The crispy potatoes were quite delicious.  The caramelized onions provided a mild sweet flavor while the potatoes combined a satisfying crispy exterior with a hot and soft center.  I also had their bacon, which was Nueske's bacon, a popular Midwestern bacon from Wisconsin.  The bacon had a smoky flavor as well as an appetizing pork flavor from the crispy fat.\n\nThe bacon was not as thick as Niman Ranch bacon, but the flavor was definitely memorable.  I also ordered their pork sausage patties, and these were good though I probably did prefer the bacon.  The center of the sausage was moist while the outside was well seared and crispy.  They get a little more adventurous with the seasoning so you get more herb and fennel notes with their sausage than you would experience at most breakfast spots.\n\nThe kitchen gussied up the pancakes a little more than they did with the other breakfast items in The Plow.  The pancakes featured both lemon and ricotta.  The lemon was nice.  It provided a noticeable lemon flavor as well as a lot of freshness.  I felt though that the ricotta probably hurt the pancake more than it helped it.  The pancakes had a great color and the smell of the pancake was very inviting.  Unfortunately, the pancake could have been sweeter.  The center was also a tad on the dry side and did not have that light and fluffy cake-like texture you would expect in an excellent pancake.\n\nService was fairly quick given how busy this restaurant gets (even on weekdays).  Prices are higher than your standard breakfast spot, but the ingredients at Plow are definitely high quality and the portions are surprisingly generous.\n\nI enjoyed The Plow at Plow though I felt the savory items were far superior to the disappointing lemon ricotta pancakes.  Part of me really loved the breakfast here, and, in some ways, Plow would rival my favorite breakfast restaurants--Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix or Huckleberry in Santa Monica, which features an excellent fried egg sandwich with bacon.  I would definitely go back and give Plow's other dishes a shot.

Yes, there's a lot of hype...yes, there will be a wait...yes, there will probably be several tourists trying out the spot.  Typically, this will sway me away from any place, but after seeing all the pictures, reading all the reviews, and also hearing from several of my SF friends how delicious it was, I ponied up and decided to make my way there.  \n\nMy husband and I opted to try it out over the 4th of July weekend on a Friday mid-day, hoping to avoid the Saturday/Sunday brunch crowd.  We just prepared ourselves for a long wait - we ended up getting there around 12:30PM or so, and I think we waited for about an hour, which isn't bad.  My husband grabbed a beer as we waited, and I popped in to one of the boutique stores just up the block to browse/bum time.\n\nWhen I was browsing at the store, I asked the store owner what she recommended at Plow.  She started off by highly recommending the \"Plow\" plate to get a sampling of all their stuff, said to (\"whatever you do\") get the baked good of the day if they aren't sold out, and then proceeded to pretty much list off every item they offered.  Pretty much, I knew right then and there that Plow would be a repeat brunch spot ;)\n\nEverything we tried was excellent - every item blew my mind.  You can tell that every ingredient they use is high quality, in season, and fresh.  The eggs, for example - the yolks are bright orange, and whites so fluffy.  I learned that they buy their eggs from a local organic egg farmer in Napa - always delivered fresh.  \n\nWhile we wanted to try everything on the menu, we tried:\n\nThe Plow (two lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs any style, choice of pork sausage/chicken sausage/bacon, crispy potatoes) *****5 stars*****- We decided to share the Plow so we could try a bunch of the stuff they offered.  We selected the pork sausage per recommendation of the waitress and poached eggs.  I can't even pick which item was my favorite - everything was so perfectly done and went so well together. The perfect amount of savory and sweet.  The crispy potatoes were the best I've ever had - crisp on the outside and soft in the inside, and piping hot from the fryer.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were the BEST pancakes ever, ever, ever, ever.  I will be getting these (at least as a \"side\") every single time.  Holy crap, so good.\n\nBanana Bread - *****4.5 stars***** One of the \"baked goods of the day\" - We thought it would be a bit much with everything else we were ordering, but since we received the recommendation to order \"whatever baked good they are offering\" we decided to go ahead.  We figured, \"well we can bring any left overs home.\"  Uhhhh, let's just say, there were no leftovers.  SO delicious; came out warm, had a crispy crust of sugar coating the top, had chunks of gooey bananas throughout, and buttery flavor.  Mmmm...\n\nLittle Gem Salad - *****5 stars ****** To balance out some of the savory of our meal, I decided to order a little gem salad.  I was expecting nothing special, but even the salad surprised me!  The dressing was amazing; fresh and tasty.  All ingredients were fresh, seasonal, and balanced everything nicely.  I wish I could get this salad for lunch every day!\n\nBubbles/Beer - We also opted to make it a true brunch and ordered some adult beverages.  Decent selection of beers and wine.  If a cup of joe is more your cup of tea ;) - I heard that their coffee (even their decaf) is excellent.\n\nOverall - this place is brunch/lunch perfection.  I am SO happy we're a quick walk to this place.  We will DEFINITELY be back many, many, more times.

If you are thinking about venturing to Potrero Hill yourself, here is some information that I hope will help you decide if Plow is worth the trip and the wait:\n\n- The Wait.  My take away from reading many Yelp reviews is that the wait runs one to two hours.  I really can't imagine waiting that long and luckily I didn't have to.  I arrived a few minutes before 8am on a Saturday and only waited about ten minutes for a party of two.  Since the restaurant doesn't open until 8am on Saturday, and we were able to get in on the first seating, we only had to wait long enough for the hostess to get to us.  It helped immensely that there were only two of us.  \n\n- Size Does Matter.  Plow is small and if your party is big, Plow won't be a good fit for you.  My recollection is that there are a handful of four-top tables but not many bigger options.  In fact, there website says they can only accommodate parties of six or less.  If you have a small party and want to sit at the counter, you can probably get seated faster.  And if you are a party of one, don't let the wait deter you, because you can probably snag a seat at the counter rather quickly.  \n\n- Food.  The food here is really good but not so good that I'd wait hours for it.  I do like how fresh their ingredients are and the uniqueness of some of their items.  You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients they use and I fully appreciate their efforts to source their ingredients locally.  Also, they make many items, like their ricotta and pork sausage in house.   Because I was starving, we (and by \"we,\" I mean \"I\") ordered lots of food.  \n\n   - Breakfast Dessert!: We were seated at the counter overlooking the freshly baked breakfast desserts so of course I had to order the chocolate chip walnut coffee cake to start.  That probably isn't the right name for it, but just know those breakfast desserts are good!\n\n   - Eggs Benny:  Plow's rendition of the classic Eggs Benedict was wonderful.  I did it with the Fra' Mani ham (Fra' Mani is a fancy pork company out of Berkley that sells its products wholesale and to Costco).\n\n   - The Plow:  Probably the most popular dish on the menu, my friend went with the Plow.  She started it and I finished it!  (Hey, I said I was starving.)  Even though I am not much of a breakfast potato person, I thought Plow's crispy potatoes were delicious and I ate way more of those potatoes than I would anyone else's breakfast potatoes!  I also really enjoyed the sausage.  I am sure it helped that I had been in town for a vegetarian wedding all weekend and was craving meat like a cave man.  The homemade pork sausage had great texture and flavor.  For me, the lemon ricotta pancakes weren't worth the hype.  They were good, and I like the unique combination, but they didn't wow me.  Nevertheless, I think Plow makes their own ricotta which is very cool and admirable.      \n\n- Service.  Service was friendly an attentive.  Despite a line out the door, the staff remains calm and keeps on plowing through the service.  I also like that they kept my coffee full and didn't rush us out of there.  \n\n- The ambiance is very cute and the d\u00e9cor is well done - hardwood floors, marble counter top, big windows and an open kitchen.  \n\n- Extras.  Plow is a very cute, cohesive, well-thought-out place.  They also have a great, classy web site.

The conservative wait time for us was 45 minutes for a table, which at the time had me concerned since my boyfriend and I had to meet up with a tour at 10am in Union Square. Immediately after the hostess told us about the wait I had asked about outdoor seating. She said that they would be seating people outside shortly, which concluded to me that our 45 minutes would be the extent of our wait if they had about 8 tables out on the sidewalk open.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had to strategize. If were were going to be seated before 9am, our order had to be ready buy the time they directed us to a table. So we went through the whole menu.  It was short and sweet which indicated to me that all of these dishes had to be good.  But the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes screamed at me, so I went with that and a side of bacon.

The lines here get super long especially on weekends, but trust me, it's worth the long agonizing wait. If it is your first time here, I would order the plow (5/5). It is just their breakfast platter with a little bit of everything. On my numerous trips back to this place, I also tried the fried egg sandwich (4/5) and their crab scramble (3/5). \n\nThe plow is basically the most amazing breakfast platter you will ever eat. It comes with a heaping pile of potatoes (5/5). The potatoes aren't your average hash brown or the soggy potatoes that come with a diner breakfast. These potatoes are super crispy and brown on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. You can hear the crunch as you bite down. You also have the option of bacon (4/5) or sausage (5/5). You really can't go wrong with either option. Their chicken apple sausage is the perfect amount of sweetness and savory. The bacon is fatty and rich. My only qualm is that the bacon is a little limp If you're really feeling hungry, get both! Why not! Also, with the plate comes the standard 2 eggs any way you like, I personally prefer them poached soft so you can dip the crispy potatoes and meat in the runny yolk. Finally, to top it all off, are 2 lemon ricotta pancakes (6/5). These pancakes are not your average fluffy pancake. They are slightly denser, but packed full of flavor. I'll be honest, I'm not a pancake person normally. Waffles win it all for me, but when it comes to these lemon ricotta pancakes, I would eat a hundred if I could. \n\nAs for the egg sandwich, they fry the egg to perfection. Yolk is perfectly runny, acting as a great sauce for the sandwich. The only reason this got a 4/5 in my book was due to the fact it really needed the addition of some meat. If you do get this sandwich, spend the extra couple bucks to add in some of that delicious bacon they have. Trust me, it'll take the sandwich to the next level. \n\nThe crab scramble had way too many green onions for my liking (I personally hate them and will pick them out given the chance, but this had way too many to do so). It covered up the taste of the crab a bit. There were large hunks of crab throughout the omelet which is great, but there were quite a few pieces of shells too, which made it a bit annoying to eat.\n\nAmazing food, great service - nothing more you could ask for.\n\nCons: \n- long wait on weekends and in the mornings \n- restaurant is small, so if you sit on the patio, it does get very cold\n\nPros: \n- brunch food here is A+ - everything is cooked to perfection\n- service is fast and friendly", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-11-30"}, {"excerpts": ["For our main dish, my friend and I split the fried egg sandwich (two fried eggs, cheddar, aioli), crispy potatoes, and a side of Nueske bacon (salty, salty bacon).

Parking was easy (no meter), we were seated right away (rare moment), and the service/ambiance screamed brunch, what more could you ask for. One thing bothered me though, there was a huge mix up with the check, we were charged an extra $20... Something was obviously wrong here. I've been reading about restaurants scamming their customers a lot lately down in Santa Ana, so I was extra careful to check the tab.

I love the texture, but the lemon was a bit to strong for my taste. I suggest getting The Plow combo if you want to enjoy these. That way you can get it with two eggs any style and your choice of housemade sausage, Neuske bacon or chicken sausage. Some salt to balance out the sweetness.\n\nMy fave is the fried egg sandwich! Two eggs over easy sandwiched by soft, toasted Acme bread with frisee, aioli and cheese with the additional Neuske bacon (everything is better with bacon!). The creamy egg yolk mixes with all the components and makes it finger lickin' good! It also comes with a side of their infamous crispy potatoes!\n\nThey're serious about their potatoes. Smashed red potatoes flavored with fresh rosemary and onions and fried to perfection! They managed to find a way for you to have your hashbrowns and country potatoes together as one!

Freebies are a generous move and it was much appreciated.  \n\nThey told us a table would be another 20 minutes but the counter was available.  We waited 20 minutes anyway for our food.\n\nI was grumpy from hunger and impatience by the time my eggs benedict came.  My poached eggs had several pieces eggshells in them.  I bit down and felt a disgusting crunch.  Aww hell naw hell naw.  Further insult - the hollandaise was no longer emulsified.  The sauce had curdled.  Gross.  Lastly, it was not good in flavor... they added too much lemon.  Thumbs down for this dish; the other components were just so so.  The side of crispy potatoes with onions was the best thing on the plate.\n\nMy lemon ricotta pancake never came so they just canceled it and I GTFO'd.\n\nThe wait is definitely not worth it.  Not even if it was good.  Which it wasn't.\n\n- - - - -\n\nComments unrelated to food:\n\nSitting at the counter gave us a full view of the cooking.  One line cook who was in charge of eggs had a permanent close-to-tears look on his face.  My friend asked if I thought they liked cooking, since he was literally pumping out eggs (fried! poached! scrambled!) dish after dish.  This guy was a one-man sweatshop for eggs.  He and the other line cook (who was in charge of meats and pancakes) very much earned their salary.  \n\nThere was a woman in the kitchen who was in charge of potatoes and plating, and she would snack on every other dish she was preparing.  She was super chill and seemed to be just standing around every five minutes while the other two line cooks toiled away.  She also only wore an apron instead of a chef's jacket.  This led me to believe she was BOSS.\n\nI think it was just my hunger talking but I started to resent every dish she plated that wasn't my food.  She kept snacking everything she plated/prepared.  Where was my damn snack?  (Ok, definitely hunger talking since they gave me my damn snack in the form of a free apple fritter.)", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Their crispy potatoes are addicting!

Unless you like to order granola or porridge or yogurt for breakfast, which has never made sense to me as a restaurant patron, there's some combination of pancakes and eggs.\n\nThe good news is that they're both excellent! And those crispy potatoes are great.\n\nI'm giving them the fifth star for two reasons:\n\n1) They have Nueske's Bacon, which is probably my favorite stuff on the market.\n\n2) They have a hot sauce brand I've never heard of and is made in the same zip code. I'm always so annoyed when I ask for hot sauce at a place and I get either Tapatio or Cholula, as both are unappealing to me. It's a bit of a surprise that more places don't make their own hot sauce as it's not too difficult and it's a nice touch. And the stuff at Plow? Not too watery and a great kick.

I remembered loving their crispy potatoes and savoring our brunch. I was dying to take my potato-loving boyfriend to Plow to introduce him to the delights of their breakfast potatoes. \n\nAlas, every time we've tried to go for the last year and half, it has been an hour+ wait. Boyfriend is not one to wait around. We usually end up somewhere nearby and have explored many delicious restaurant alternatives as a result (a plus after all?). Well, we finally got our opportunity over a recent ridiculously rainy weekend. It was a downpour. My boyfriend woke me up at 7am on a Sunday and said, \"Plow opens at 8! Let's go today. It's our best chance.\" Look at the things we do for love!\n\nWe went (though I dragged my feet getting out of bed) and arrived around 8:30. The wait was going to be between 1 to 1.5 hours. (!!!!!) WTF?!? We decided to wait. I banked on the fact that everyone who put their names down ahead of us likely didn't want to wait around in the rain. As luck would have it, we were seated after about 30 minutes. We ordered quickly -- two coffees, two dungeness crab scrambles, one side order of lemon ricotta pancakes, please! \n\nAnd then we waited for an hour. We watched all the people around us get their food and begin eating. Our server came over to explain there had been a snafu in the kitchen and our food was just being fired. No apologies. No offer of something to put in our stomachs in the meantime to offset the three cups of coffee we had been drinking during the wait. We watched the people who were seated after us finish and pay their bill before our meals arrived. And then when it did arrive, it was fine... fine as in mediocre, not fine as in \"all is right in the world.\" Our scrambles were pretty salty and we got one tiny pancake to split... perhaps we could have asked for more info on what the \"side\" of pancakes consisted of.\n\nWhen we got our tab, we still got no apologies, nothing comped off of our bill, and no fulfillment from our experience. After a year and half of trying to return to Plow, it was a bust in the end. We left with a sour taste in our mouths and confusion as to why so many people keep coming back and waiting that long.

We got there at about 12:40 (I got to the city 30 minutes late and my friend got lost on the way there. You live in SF and you've been there countless times before, HOW DO YOU GET LOST??) when it was packed, giving us a 45-60 minute wait. I didn't mind at all; I'm a really patient person and we ended up spending that time in a nearby bookstore anyway. We got back and opted to eat outside on a beautiful day in the city. It was kind of awkward eating on a slanted plane, but it wasn't terribly uncomfortable. And the pigeons walking around the tables got a little bothersome (but not in an annoying way, if that makes sense), but that's also a risk you take sitting outside. And the blankets they had available were a nice touch in case it got chilly. Okay, none of y'all want to hear about this, let's talk food!\n\nGenerally I like to try what a place is known for on the first visit, which would thus be the Plow, but my friend decided to order one herself and offered to have me try some of her lemon ricotta pancakes. I easily obliged and chose a brunch favorite of mine anywhere: eggs benedict with ham. First of all, I loved my eggs benedict. Not too much hollandaise sauce and the english muffins were quite big, and quite deliciously fluffy. Also: I love eggs. Good choice, me. I also had a little bit of my friends' pancakes. It was then in that moment of that first bite when I promised myself I'd be back to have a whole plate of it for myself. Oh, and I can't forget:\n\nThem crispy potatoes, tho.\n\nI'd come back just for them, TBH. Furthermore, our waitress was super nice (and super cute) and, oh, they have Tapatio. I already liked this place from first impression, but honestly they had me at Tapatio. The coffee was decent, though I'd love to try their cold brew some time. It wasn't quite warm enough that day for it. WELP I guess that's another reason to come back huh?\n\nAnyway, to sum up, there really wasn't anything from my experience that would deserve to have a star docked off, so 5 it is!

We had heard good things about Plow and we were excited to give it a try. \n\nWe arrived on a Sunday at 9:00 a.m. and we were told that it would be an hour wait.  The wait wasn't actually that long.  It felt like 20 minutes but it was probably 40 as we were busy chatting.  We sat outside.  \n\nAs we looked at the menu, someone pointed out a sentence in italics that said something to the effect of \"no modifications to the menu.\"  I don't have the exact wording.  Well, to start, that's a bit of a buzz kill as who doesn't modify something even a little?  I decided to order all \"sides\" so that I could enjoy what I wanted and not have a plate with things that I don't care for included.

Actually, I've been hearing raves about Plow from friends, the blogs, and pretty much anybody who had been and weathered the wait for their tasty breakfasts. Truth be told, I am not enamored with Mission Beach Cafe or Boogaloos and didn't think that breakfast at Plow would wow me.\n\nThe breakfast wowed me. \n\nWe started with a corn and millet muffin, freshly baked and still warm from the oven. The muffin was crumbly and a bit hard to eat but the crust on the muffin top was crunchy and the millet added crispy bits to the slightly sweet corn muffin. Seriously though, all muffins should be eaten fresh and warm from the oven. \n\nNext up were a la carte orders of an almond pancake (gluten-free!) and a pumpkin pancake. The pumpkin pancake was fine, similar to what I make at home, but the almond pancake was really interesting. I didn't believe it was actually gluten-free at first b/c the texture was so spot on and it wasn't heavily almond flavored. I dislike marzipan, so I was quite pleased at the neutral flavor profile of the pancake. We asked the server and she informed us that it was made with almond, oat, and coconut flour. An excellent option for the g-f people out there.\n\nThe soft scrambled eggs were the turning point for me, where I switched from liking Plow to loving Plow. Of course we've all read about the proper way to slowly scramble eggs, slow and over low heat a la Julia Child or Jacques Pepin, and I thought I had it right before. I was wrong. These eggs were so, so silky. Not runny, but perfectly silky, highlighted by fava greens, chanterelles, and goat cheese. The much lauded crispy potatoes and some levain toast (well buttered with butter you could actually taste) were also there. I don't even like eggs and I kept going back to them, passing over the crispy fried potatoes!\n\nWe also tried the Chinese Breakfast whose name manages to simultaneously bring to mind my family and Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast. Anyway, of course you can't go wrong with gingery braised pork shoulder over rice, but the soft scrambled eggs are really where it's at.\n\nAll the ingredients used were obviously quality; seasoning levels and ingredient ratios were also well balanced. Loved the clean yet rustic vibe of the naturally sunny dining room. Also loved our server who understood that we were there to sample some different dishes vs eating at a traditional pace.

Out waitress was so nice and came by to check it everything was well. \n\nNow for the food. I had the plow, which consisted of bacon, eggs, crispy potatoes (my 2nd favorite item on the plate), and the mini lemon ricotta pancakes (the best part on the plate). I don't know why, but the potatoes just stood out for me. They were perfectly crispy and had a nice herb flavor. I've wanted to try lemon ricotta pancakes for a while and I'm glad I got to try it here. They were fluffy and moist. You get the subtle underlying flavors of lemon in there, like when eating a lemon cream filled cookie. So good. \n\nI also got to try the french toast. Just delightful. The pure maple syrup really made it taste as good as it did, but I think the ingredient that really did it was the caramel. There was a bit of caramel on the bananas and it just made it stand out from all the other french toast that I've had before. \n\nI'd love to come here again.

When we got there, we were promptly greeted by the hostess, and got our name on the list.   The wait was about 20 minutes on a Sunday morning around 10.  The service was fantastic, and the food was even better.   What gives their dishes a final \"wow\" are the crispy potatoes.  Never have I had a potato fried and seasoned quite like theirs.  They were excellent.  The fried egg sandwich, while good - should only be eaten with a knife and fork.  And the Plow - is just awesome.   To top it off, when we were done, we asked the waitress where we should walk to try and hail a cab, as the restaurant is in a more residential area, and we were worried that taxis wouldn't be readily available.  She instantly offered to call one for us!   As we were waiting in front while she was on the phone, she noticed one down the street and we were able to hail that one.  It was impressive that she was going out of her way to help us, as she did more than we were expecting!

The rest all culminates together - the friendly service, the intimate ambiance, the very nice owners-couple, the other excited patrons, the location, the venue - to make for a perfect way to start off your day.

This magical combo with chili, garlic egg fried up, frisee (a type of endive) and parsley atop a toasted Acme brioche ($15) was heavenly. With a side of plow potatoes, this meal leans on the carb-heavy side of the breakfast food spectrum, but I cannot complain because it was simply amazing. *I do have to warn you, however, that the egg is super runny, so consume with extreme caution* They also serve Equator drip coffee! Although not a seasoned coffee drinker myself, I do appreciate this particular brand of coffee ever since my first tasting at its home base location in Marin County. My two other classmates each ordered the plow signature dish, a tasting platter, if you will, and a good first-timer dish according to the waitress. It included two eggs with your choice of house made pork sausage patties, Nueske's bacon, or chicken apple sausage, and two (mini) lemon ricotta pancakes with a side of yet again those delicious plow potatoes ($17.50). One of them also ordered fresh grapefruit juice and a warm buttermilk biscuit with honey butter (omg). \n\nSERVICE. 5 stars. The waitress even knew how to use an instax mini 9. She deserved bonus points for this. Tuesday morning around 10am is also the best time to come if you can. We were seated almost instantly upon arrival-- it took longer for my instax camera to produce an image on the Polaroid film. She was also very accommodating and gave great recommendations. We got pretty good seats by the window, but do be aware that since space is tight, the tables feel communal even though they're separate from each other. So if you're okay with sitting right next to the table next to you, then it should be fine. Get friendly.\n\nI will reiterate: excellent food, excellent service.

The restaurant had quite a number of people, so we were kicked to curb, to wait in the wind. By kicking us to the curb, I mean they told us to step outside to wait till we're seated because they don't want it cramping up by the entrance. I like this idea because it makes the dining experience more enjoyable. They told us to wait about 5 mins, but we were seated within 3 mins. \n\nLocated on the corner of Mississippi St and Texas St, this place can easily be missed..only because it's located in a residential area. They do have a sign sticking out that says \"The Plow\" though.

The drink looks adorable and instagram-worthy with its cute striped straw and lemon on the side, but don't let that fool you! I like the looks of it, but the straw is made of paper which can make it soggy. That's the only thing that irks me because the longer it sits in the lemonade, the faster it becomes soggy and the harder it becomes to drink. \n\nFor my dish, I ordered The Plow ($16) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#NYJXSTwF-Ugv0vFpKULyvQ] and a side of Nueske Bacon ($5.50) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#fzy-q83TFoTe12n157Wu4Q].

I asked her nicely if she could move her chair in, well, she moved her butt, not moving the chair and barely at that. So basically I just shoved past her. Good thing I was sitting next to her and didn't have to stare at her sour-puss face the entire meal like DK did sitting across from her. Anyway, she made for good conversation.\n\nOnto the food...once we were seated, our waitress took a while to bring us our waters and by then we were ready to order. You really can't go wrong with a breakfast place that has a pig sign under the name of their restaurant. Mmmm.....oink.\n\nI had: the plow  two eggs, choice of Nueske bacon, house made pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage, two pancakes + crispy potatoes  14\n\nDK had: max's biscuits + gravy  two buttermilk biscuits, pork sausage gravy, crispy potatoes  11\n\nIt came out fairly quickly and it was GOOD. The bacon was plentiful and was cooked just right, the pancakes had this lemony hint to them and were on the smaller size, but that's because they're not your average pancakes. They were really good though, but kind of had a french toast consistency and about the size of English muffins. The potatoes had some sort of Saffron or something on them, because they were as yellow as my egg yolks, but boy, were they good. I normally leave potatoes untouched on my plate (except for the hash brown kind), but these were awesome and just the right amount of crispy.\n\nDK's biscuits and gravy were really good and the gravy was coma-inducing. \n\nI really enjoyed my breakfast, sans bitch.

I've been reading about restaurants scamming their customers a lot lately down in Santa Ana, so I was extra careful to check the tab.

However, the meal was worth the trouble!\n\nWe arrived around 9:30 on a Tuesday and it was much busier than I expected. Fortunately not busy enough that we had to wait because thankfully, there were two seats available at the bar. Some helpful notes: they will not seat you unless your entire party is present. Even if it is just one other person. No exceptions. Also, there's only 6-7 seats at the bar and roughly seven tables (very small space). There are a couple tables for outside dining as well.\n\nOwner/Chef Maxine Siu was directly in front of us busily preparing dishes in their small partially-open kitchen. She was careful not to make eye contact with any patrons. Totally understandable, but it would have been so much fun to talk food. \n\nRuben started with a cup of Equator Coffee ($3.50) and we shared a Cinnamon Brioche ($4). It was a delicious rendition of a cinnamon roll and the center was perfectly gooey and flavorful. I selected The Plow ($16) with sunny side-up eggs, housemade pork sausage, two Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and crispy potatoes. The sausage was nice, but dry. Not my favorite sausage.

By kicking us to the curb, I mean they told us to step outside to wait till we're seated because they don't want it cramping up by the entrance. I like this idea because it makes the dining experience more enjoyable.

They do have a sign sticking out that says \"The Plow\" though.

Their menu changes weekly, so come back often. The boast fresh organic produce from local farms, which is the norm in San Francisco, but not the standard.\n\nTheir french toast is crunchy outside with a custard-like creaminess inside, delicately sweet and garnished with fresh berries and a brulee'd banana. Served with subtle sweet Vermont syrup (not too sweet, not too thick, just perfect syrup). \n\nLemon ricotta pancakes is my favorite and it's one of the reasons I keep coming back. I have convinced many patrons to try their lemon ricotta pancakes when I brunch here. They are dense with pockets filled with ricotta (a light cheese, similar to mozzarella) and a subtle lemon flavor. I've tried to replicate their lemon-ricotta pancakes and while my pancakes can be similar in taste, they do not have the same thick, rich and hearty elements that Plow creates.\n\nThe eggs benedict are okay. The star of the dish is the hollandaise sauce which I feel is too zesty.  Most holllandaise sauce has a mild creamy flavor with subtle tang, however Plow's hollandaise sauce has a robust tang that overpowers the other mildly flavored components. I suspect a heavy hand in lemon juice. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. \n\n\"The Plow\" is a good way to sample all of their good things (it comes with lemon ricotta pancakes -smaller version). The potatoes are tasty but their inconsistent size makes the large pieces stand out in buttery goodness and the tiny bits too burnt to eat. Their homemade sausages are a bit dry. However, you can't go wrong with the chicken apple sausages (yum). \n\nThe house made organic yogurt + granola with fresh fruit is not worth it. I think that it could have used more berries and less citrus fruits in my honest opinion. \n\nThe fried egg sandwich is okay. The nueske bacon makes it a tad better. The acme bun was lovely. Everything else was standard. \n\nThe dungenous crab scramble was tasty. It had hearty pieces of crab meat. Definitely a go to dish to try. But I think it's a bit pricey at $17. \n\nThe almond pancake was disappointing. I didn't taste any flavor of almond. But I suppose that it is a fan for gluten-free eaters. \n\nThe counter seating is quite small and can be uncomfortable, however that's where you get to see the magic of everything being cooked. I like sitting outside because it's quieter. Inside its warm and loud. \n\nPrice wise, I think it's expensive. IMO, I think that brunch should be $10 and under. Many of the dishes here can be made at home for the fraction of the price. The prices here $10-$17 per meal. Not including extra such as drinks or side dishes. The coffee alone is a whopping $3.75.\n\nOverall, I think that the food is prepared well and presented beautifully. I will return because think their lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious.

The combination with farmer's cheese, pickled red onion, caper, dill, Acme levain, and simple green salad served only to complement the dish even better. As for the Plow, I loved the potatoes because of the seasoning that the chefs use on it, which is most stellar & left my mouth most happy. The lemon ricotta pancakes were just as soft, moist, and their tartiness was just perfect & not too overpowering. Eggs & sausage were also done well.

The best move is to arrive at 7:45am and you're most likely guaranteed to get seated with the first group. 15 min wait is worth the early rise.

Sure the soft and warm yolk of fried egg on top of the toast slowly dripping onto the prosciutto and soaking in to the toast makes it irresistible, but this toast did not change my life. In fact, I am confident that I can recreate this at home. Additionally, the potatoes were solid, but I've had much better potatoes in the past. At this point I was leaning towards 4 stars.\n\n...then I tasted the pancake...\n\nAnd, for the first time in my life, I understood what a perfect pancake feels and tastes like. The pancake itself was an oxymoron: fluffy, but compact; light, but rich in flavor; strong lemon flavor, but hidden sweetness. It was so good, I forced my friend (who was full at that point) to try some. Hands down, the best pancake I've ever had. There is no comparison. None.\n\nThe most striking thing about Plow is the fact that the space is so simple and unsuspecting. And that's what gives it character. You come in with high expectations given the favorable reviews, but somehow Plow still manages to make you feel comfortable and catches you off guard. \n\nI didn't fully believe the hype before I ate here, but after experiencing it for myself I can truly say I'm sold.

The location itself is pretty small and very homely / cozy, with huge windows that allow sunlight to pour in (especially valuable for those who don't enjoy as much sunlight due to living elsewhere in SF...).  If only I could park myself here on weekdays and read a book / eat breakfast every day... (and if only I had unlimited monetary resources...)\n\nThe food itself is delightful.  During my last visit, I ordered the almond flour pancakes, which are perfectly fluffy on the inside, with the right amount of almond flavor so as to deliver a rich taste without being overwhelming.  I've also ordered the french toast with strawberry compote, mascarpone, and syrup, which was tremendous.  I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment on meat dishes, but friends whom I have gone to Plow with all rave about the dishes they've gotten (everything from The Plow to the Nicoise salad).  Plow is also one of the few places that serve Equator coffee in SF (especially now that La Boulange is being acquired by Starbucks) - while expensive at $3.75 / cup (unlimited refills), it complements a meal perfectly.  Service is great given how hectic things seem to be every time I visit (which has always been on weekends), as the staff is very friendly.\n\nThe main negative aspect, as other folks have noted here, is the wait - it can be absolutely brutal at 1-2 hours on weekends.  That wait will get you a single table for 2 if you're lucky, or perhaps a seat at a table of 4 (typically shared with other people if your party is fewer than 4 people) or at the bar.  If you show up after 10:30am on a weekend, be prepared to wait a while ... with limited breakfast / brunch options nearby if you decide that you can't stand the wait.  Plow is also quite pricey for brunch (even by SF standards) - in my opinion, it's worth it, but coupled with the long wait it's something to keep in mind.\n\nAll in all, Plow is definitely worth visiting - and if you can make it work, visit on a weekday to avoid the brutal lines (note that they're closed on Mondays).", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I started with the Equator coffee (GREAT), and ordered the Plow for brunch.
