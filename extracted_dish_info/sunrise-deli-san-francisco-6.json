I never tasted shawarma before and had no idea what I was getting myself into but evidently schawarma is a little SWEET and I hate SWEET meat! On top of that, the lamb was so dry I had a really hard time swallowing it... I almost choked at one point.

They're really into Yelp.  One of the employees was sporting a People love us on Yelp shirt and they had Yelp cards on the counter.  Cute.\n\nThe items in the deli case looked good: hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli, and some other salads.

There are half a dozen tables.  \n\nI ordered the chicken shawerma ($5.99).  Good price.  The all white meat chicken pieces were on the larger side (I like my meat in smaller, thinner pieces) but tender and flavorful (marinated with lemon and garlic).  Good tahini sauce. Quite a bit of fresh parsley.  Lettuce, tomatoes.  Everything was very good though the pita bread itself wasn't out of the ordinary (you have to try the pita bread at Rihab's/Good Bites in Belmont to know what really extraordinary flatbread is like).\n\nI tried the Armenian pizza ($2.59), a doughy flatbread topped with ground beef, onions and spices.

We ended up parking in front of this place and noticed the sign on the window that says \"follow our truck, best falafel in town etc.\" so I decided to whip out my trusty yelp app and check out their reviews. Reviews were almost 5 stars so we decided to check it out.\n\nWalked in, looked at the menu and immediately noticed the avocado falafel pita sandwich.. I love avocado and was excited to take the first bite but unfortunately that fantasy was short-lived because they said that their avocados were not good enough to be served which is a good sign of customer service even though that was the only thing that looked appealing :(\n\nI was then forced to pick something else and with the help of my bf, picked the falafel plate.

Also, in the front there is this case of sweets.. we got the pistachio baklava (which is TO DIE for! love the flaky-ness) and this chocolate almond crunch thingie which was also heaven. \n\nCons: the lamb schawarma plate was not as good as it smelled.. I never tasted shawarma before and had no idea what I was getting myself into but evidently schawarma is a little SWEET and I hate SWEET meat! On top of that, the lamb was so dry I had a really hard time swallowing it... I almost choked at one point. Their hummus taste like any other kind of hummus except they put some purple sour steak fry looking things in it, which killed it for me. \n\nThe thing that disappointed me the most was their tahini sauce.. I was expecting it to be thick and creamy because to me, that's always the best part of Mediterranean food! Sunrise deli's version of tahini sauce is EXTREMELY watery and sour and bitter all at the same time.. the taste echoed through my nostrils like wasabi.\n\nThey also have this chili sauce which is noticeably filled with chili seeds so when I took a spoonful and put it directly into my mouth, I was expecting it to be so hot that my eardrums would burn but it was not even close.\n\nIf I ever do come back it would be ONLY for the falafel, baklava and other sweets..", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-07-28"}, {"excerpts": ["I had a falafel plate and loved it.

I came here for takeout and got a falafel wrap and a chicken kabob plate. \n\nFalafel wrap ($7) - 5 stars. It was so full of falafel, veggies and hummus that made it really messy to eat. The falafels were really the star of this. They were perfectly crunchy and had so much flavor, really stood out from other falafels that I've had.\n\nChicken kabob plate ($12) - 3 stars. It had a decent amount of chicken but I thought it just lacked flavor. It came with 2 sides so my sister tried the rice/lentils and babagonoush. The rice and lentils were good. The other was just alright. Kind of lacked flavor there. \n\nCouple other notes, parking kind of sucks being on Irving. If you eat in, you order, eat, and then pay. Service is a bit slow. It took us about 15 mins to get our food and were the only ones there. \n\nWould definitely come back for falafels and maybe will try their shawarma next time.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the Chicken Kabob plate for $12."], "author": "Rod M.", "review": "Food was cold and the hummus was just o.k.
