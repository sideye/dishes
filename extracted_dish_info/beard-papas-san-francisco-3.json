It wasn't even 5 seconds, Sheez! and I was her only customer at the time too.\n\nNormally bakeries/ pastry shops that sell sweet products, hire cheerful people to match the food they sell. The manager of this branch didn't get that memo. The employees looked unhappy, with a deadpan, monotone voice and blank facial expressions, like if either they were inside a jail or they thought that they're too cool to work in that job, not sure. Definitely a disincentive to buy more stuff.\n\nI just came here to try the new mini-croissants, available in 3 flavors: butter (regular), chocolate and cheese (cream cheese). Sold by 3 for $2.95/$3.45, 1/2 dozen for $5.25/$6.25, or one dozen for $10/$12. I bought a mix to try every flavor. The \"Petit-cro\" looked nice and tasted okay, but the inside is a little dry.

The milk tea puff is available in San Francisco only. The coffee one is available in Redwood City only. \n\nThey have cheesecake sticks for $1.25. It was good but not as good as a regular cheesecake. \n\nThe Fondant Au Chocolat ($2.25) is mouthwatering!!! It's not too sweet either. \n\nThe eclairs cost a little bit more than the cream puffs. I'm not very fond of them. To me, they look exactly like a cream puff except the puff part of the eclair is more dry. And the taste is.....bleh.

For real.\n\nMy co-worker and I got a Daily Candy email one day that notified us to the cream puff bakery just two blocks (dangerous) from our place of employment.  Before lunch, we headed over and ordered the vanilla cream puff (other flavors are not currently available).  We waited a few minutes as a fresh batch of puffs came out of the oven and watched in amazement as the baker inserted the vanilla cream into the pastry.  A woman then gave the puffs a dusting of powdered sugar and handed the treats to us.\n\nAs we sat down on a sunny bench right outside, we looked at each other and exclaimed our excitement.  We both admitted, however, that we thought we didn't like cream puffs or couldn't remember having or wanting one before.  Even with this prejudice, the anticipation from the Daily Candy blurb and all of the happy customers in the surrounding area made us eager to stuff our faces.  Which we did.\n\nOh, that first bite!  The warm buttery outer layers of pastry hit my tongue and were immediately followed by the cold cream custard filling.  We exclaimed many superlatives as we ate the puffs in a 2 minute span that felt like time had stopped.  \"Look, I can see pieces of vanilla bean!\" my co-worker stated with glee.  \"It's like a vanilla cloud in my mouth!\" I replied.\n\nWe walked back to the office unable to gripe about the day's awful start and instead talked about the greatness of the puff.

I've enjoyed BP in Japan, Singapore, Hollywood, Gardena, and now here in the Bay Area.  My opinion is purely my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own.  I'm just here to educate and answer questions raised on previous reviews.\r\n\r\nFYI...this is a long post and yes I have too much time on my hands =).  I base all my info on a 15min chat session with the manager of the Yerba Buena store and my personal experiences.\r\n\r\n1) Japanese vs French Puffs\r\nKeep in mind this is a Japanese style cream puff.  Hence the crispy shell, softer dough inside, and semi-sweet japanese Nama custard (custard and whipped cream).  I believe this is what makes the taste and texture unique.  French style puffs are softer and have a heavier, sweeter cream.  See #2 below for puff size differences.\r\n\r\n2) Napkins required?\r\nFirst of all, these puffs are big and a good amount of japanese style custard cream is purposely injected into the crispy shells.  Thus the flaky shell, amt of cream, and dusted baker's sugar leads to quite a mess.  If you saw the CNN Anderson Cooper piece on BP, the messy eating experience was one of the funny things they mentioned.  **WARNING...my opinion here** I personally feel you get quality and quantity in this pastry.  Because of the larger size puff and extra room for cream, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth and don't experience the sugar sickness afterwards because of the lighter, semi-sweet custard.  I couldn't consume french style cream in equal amounts...hmm now that I think of it maybe that's why French cream puffs are smaller. \r\n\r\n3) Pricey?\r\nSome may think $1.75 for a cream puff is expensive, but personally for me and my taste...I'd rather pay for a fresh, larger-than-norm BP puff than $3 for a Satura Cream Puff (decent, but not flaky...more bread like), $1.50 for a Ranch 99 Cream Puff, or $2+ for a behind-the-glass muffin/scone/danish at my local Starbucks.  But a BP puff does go perfectly with Starbuck's dark roast.\r\n\r\n4) Are they really fresh?\r\nShells are baked every 20mins and custard made every 2-3hours.  The puffs are never served hot or piping from the oven.  They need to be cooled out of the oven to get that flaky texture.  If the shells are not cooled properly or if the custard is pumped in too soon...moisture will soften the shells prematurely.  \r\n\r\n5) Why the lines?\r\nGoing back to #4 above, the lines primarily form when patrons are left waiting for the ovens to finish baking or when the puff are still in the cooling process.  Plus add in the marketing factor here.\r\n\r\n6) What's up with all the workers?\r\nEvery BP I've visited has had a Cream Puff line of workers so its part of the experience whether you like it or not.  Keep in mind, if they had fewer workers things might move slower.  But there is a difference between BP bakeries ambiance...I'll explain.  Have your ever been to a sushi restaurant where they greet you loudly in Japanese, proceed to shout orders, bow to you while saying Domo (sp?).  Well some BP's have this same experience where they greet/shout in Japanese which makes it more \"entertaining\"...purely my opinion here.  The Yerba Buena store is bland in this sense, but at least the workers are nice and courteous.    \r\n\r\n7) Other locations?\r\nThere are two more to be open this year...Redwood City and the SF Center a block away.  Is it just me or are the two SF stores a bit close?  Why not spread them out?  In any case, living in the Peninsula myself...I'll be a regular in the Redwood City spot.  After doing a bit of research with the Yerba Buena baker, the Redwood City BP will be bigger, have more coffee house style seating, and have a barista.\r\n\r\n8) Why only vanilla?  Where's the fondant and cheesecake fingers?\r\nThe manager I spoke to didn't really have a good answer here, but at least they finally started serving chocolate puffs this week.  As for the fondant and cheesecake fingers...good news is that  they also are baked fresh daily, bad news is that they don't start selling these sweets until a month after grand opening...bah! \r\n\r\n9) Who is Beard Papa?\r\nWell its kind of an entertaining story...I suggest you walk in and ask one of the workers.\r\n\r\nSorry for the Beard Papa thesis, hopefully you'll enjoy them as much as I do!", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-06-02"}, {"excerpts": ["there are chocolate and vanilla creams, then 5 other flavors which are rotated weekly (caramel, green tea, milk tea, pumpkin and strawberry).

The San Francisco store on the new Yerba Buena Lane is one of a few U.S. franchises; the others are in New York, New Jersey, Boston, Hawaii and Los Angeles. \n\nAfter we'd waited for about 10 minutes, one of the staff came down the line, apologized, and told us it would be 30 minutes before another batch was ready. Because we were only ordering one, we decided to stay, in hopes it would be quicker. \n\nBeard Papa is quite the scene. Besides the long line winding out the door, there's a lot going on inside. When you first step over the threshold, you're hit with this delicious buttery scent. You can see the puffs baking in these industrial-looking, high-tech ovens. They start off the size of a hockey puck, and then rise into a much larger, 3-inch puff. The staff, dressed chef's whites, forms an assembly line when the puffs are done cooling, with one person injecting the custard into the puff, the second dusting it with powdered sugar and placing it in a bag, and the third packing them into carrying boxes.\n\nThis place inspires some kind of weird fanaticism, and after having a vanilla cream puff, I have to say it may be merited. The people in line were mostly all Asian, as were all of the staff. A family with four little boys was taking pictures with one of the staff. Overhead, on two flat screen TVs, news clips about Beard Papa played; at one point, I looked up and saw Anderson Cooper on CNN eating a cream puff. The store sells T-shirts with its mascot --- an old, bearded man in a cap, and the saying, \"Who's Your Papa?\" This is probably temporary, but there was a sign saying \"Limit: One dozen per customer.\" \n\nThe menu over the cream puff area had \"Coming Soon\" taped over all of the selections, except the vanilla cream puffs. Under coming soon: cream puffs of different flavors --- chocolate, caramel, green tea, pumpkin, milk tea and strawberry. With the exception of chocolate, the flavors will rotate on a weekly basis. There are also the curiously named cheesecake sticks, the fondant au chocolat and clairs. \n\nThe puff itself is a marvel of choux pastry: flaky, buttery, and crunchy. The cream is also unique, and delicious. It is a not-too-sweet mixture of whipped cream and custard that the sign in Beard Papa's claims it takes two hours to make. You can see them scraping the vanilla bean pods, too, to extract the vanilla that flecks the cream in the vanilla cream puffs.

I had actually bought these cream puffs and brought them back to my hotel so as to enjoy breakfast in bed...I thought it'd be all luxurious, but I ended up just making a big flaky, creamy mess for the hotel maids to clean up later.\n\nThese cream puffs are delicate little things - the cream will ooze out the minute you bite into it so be prepared to lick all the cream off before it falls to the floor.  Let's play a little game of, 'Don't drop the cream!'.  These things are not only delicate, but also fairly small.  They aren't so small in that it's not worth buying them; I would actually say that for their size, they are filled with cream!  What's great about this place is that you can actually choose which filling you want.  I had come on a day where there was a bunch of construction outside and I guess they were preparing to close down temporarily because of it so there were limited flavors available.  They only had the vanilla and chocolate fillings available; and as for the glazed puff itself: only strawberry, green tea, chocolate and vanilla were available.  I was so looking forward to trying all these other flavors, but that wasn't in the cards for me that day.\n\nThere was a selection of cream puffs already to go, but then you had the option of picking and choosing your puff and your cream.  For each cream puff, either created by yourself or pre-prepared, it was about $3-4, so I ended up walking away having spent about $12 on cream puffs.  I didn't blink too much of an eye at this because I do love cream puffs...in fact, these cream puffs made for a breakfast of champions.

The sprinkling of powdered sugar did very little to enhance the flavor.\n\nThe whipped cream custard, so proudly advertised as having lots of vanilla beans in it, was similarly lacking.

"], "author": "Deb K.", "review": "At 3:30 p.m., the line was 25 people long for Beard Papa, the new cream puff shop owned by the Japanese corporation Muginoho. The San Francisco store on the new Yerba Buena Lane is one of a few U.S. franchises; the others are in New York, New Jersey, Boston, Hawaii and Los Angeles. \n\nAfter we'd waited for about 10 minutes, one of the staff came down the line, apologized, and told us it would be 30 minutes before another batch was ready. Because we were only ordering one, we decided to stay, in hopes it would be quicker. \n\nBeard Papa is quite the scene. Besides the long line winding out the door, there's a lot going on inside. When you first step over the threshold, you're hit with this delicious buttery scent. You can see the puffs baking in these industrial-looking, high-tech ovens. They start off the size of a hockey puck, and then rise into a much larger, 3-inch puff. The staff, dressed chef's whites, forms an assembly line when the puffs are done cooling, with one person injecting the custard into the puff, the second dusting it with powdered sugar and placing it in a bag, and the third packing them into carrying boxes.\n\nThis place inspires some kind of weird fanaticism, and after having a vanilla cream puff, I have to say it may be merited. The people in line were mostly all Asian, as were all of the staff. A family with four little boys was taking pictures with one of the staff. Overhead, on two flat screen TVs, news clips about Beard Papa played; at one point, I looked up and saw Anderson Cooper on CNN eating a cream puff. The store sells T-shirts with its mascot --- an old, bearded man in a cap, and the saying, \"Who's Your Papa?\" This is probably temporary, but there was a sign saying \"Limit: One dozen per customer.\" \n\nThe menu over the cream puff area had \"Coming Soon\" taped over all of the selections, except the vanilla cream puffs. Under coming soon: cream puffs of different flavors --- chocolate, caramel, green tea, pumpkin, milk tea and strawberry. With the exception of chocolate, the flavors will rotate on a weekly basis. There are also the curiously named cheesecake sticks, the fondant au chocolat and clairs. \n\nThe puff itself is a marvel of choux pastry: flaky, buttery, and crunchy. The cream is also unique, and delicious. It is a not-too-sweet mixture of whipped cream and custard that the sign in Beard Papa's claims it takes two hours to make. You can see them scraping the vanilla bean pods, too, to extract the vanilla that flecks the cream in the vanilla cream puffs. I think this may be a new obsession for me.", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-05-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I did not appreciate waiting in line and then being told they only have 2 items available - Green Tea and Chocolate, I tried both.

I had actually bought these cream puffs and brought them back to my hotel so as to enjoy breakfast in bed...I thought it'd be all luxurious, but I ended up just making a big flaky, creamy mess for the hotel maids to clean up later.\n\nThese cream puffs are delicate little things - the cream will ooze out the minute you bite into it so be prepared to lick all the cream off before it falls to the floor.  Let's play a little game of, 'Don't drop the cream!'.  These things are not only delicate, but also fairly small.  They aren't so small in that it's not worth buying them; I would actually say that for their size, they are filled with cream!  What's great about this place is that you can actually choose which filling you want.  I had come on a day where there was a bunch of construction outside and I guess they were preparing to close down temporarily because of it so there were limited flavors available.  They only had the vanilla and chocolate fillings available; and as for the glazed puff itself: only strawberry, green tea, chocolate and vanilla were available.  I was so looking forward to trying all these other flavors, but that wasn't in the cards for me that day.\n\nThere was a selection of cream puffs already to go, but then you had the option of picking and choosing your puff and your cream.  For each cream puff, either created by yourself or pre-prepared, it was about $3-4, so I ended up walking away having spent about $12 on cream puffs.  I didn't blink too much of an eye at this because I do love cream puffs...in fact, these cream puffs made for a breakfast of champions.  They didn't hold me over for long and their sugary base probably wasn't good for my diet, but they tasted pretty good in the moment.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-24"}, {"excerpts": ["- we had a strawberry glazed one and a matcha glazed one, both with vanilla cream.

The consistency is light.\n\nAnd of course all of the puffs are topped off with powered sugar.  So if you don't like having powdery sugared lips/ mouth, then you should request for non.

I'm not sure what the most disturbing part of those sentences are, but I'll leave that up to you to decipher.\n\nRegardless, the cream puffs are pretty damn amazing. I'm not normally a fan of puffed pastry seeded in custard and whipped cream, but stopping in was an unexpected treat.  I had the cookie crumb pastry with vanilla bean filling.  It was... awesome.  They also serve treats in stick form which is a form I am fond of.  They had tiramisu, cheesecake and strawberry.  They also have eclairs and chocolate fondant.

"], "author": "Deb K.", "review": "At 3:30 p.m., the line was 25 people long for Beard Papa, the new cream puff shop owned by the Japanese corporation Muginoho. The San Francisco store on the new Yerba Buena Lane is one of a few U.S. franchises; the others are in New York, New Jersey, Boston, Hawaii and Los Angeles. \n\nAfter we'd waited for about 10 minutes, one of the staff came down the line, apologized, and told us it would be 30 minutes before another batch was ready. Because we were only ordering one, we decided to stay, in hopes it would be quicker. \n\nBeard Papa is quite the scene. Besides the long line winding out the door, there's a lot going on inside. When you first step over the threshold, you're hit with this delicious buttery scent. You can see the puffs baking in these industrial-looking, high-tech ovens. They start off the size of a hockey puck, and then rise into a much larger, 3-inch puff. The staff, dressed chef's whites, forms an assembly line when the puffs are done cooling, with one person injecting the custard into the puff, the second dusting it with powdered sugar and placing it in a bag, and the third packing them into carrying boxes.\n\nThis place inspires some kind of weird fanaticism, and after having a vanilla cream puff, I have to say it may be merited. The people in line were mostly all Asian, as were all of the staff. A family with four little boys was taking pictures with one of the staff. Overhead, on two flat screen TVs, news clips about Beard Papa played; at one point, I looked up and saw Anderson Cooper on CNN eating a cream puff. The store sells T-shirts with its mascot --- an old, bearded man in a cap, and the saying, \"Who's Your Papa?\" This is probably temporary, but there was a sign saying \"Limit: One dozen per customer.\" \n\nThe menu over the cream puff area had \"Coming Soon\" taped over all of the selections, except the vanilla cream puffs. Under coming soon: cream puffs of different flavors --- chocolate, caramel, green tea, pumpkin, milk tea and strawberry. With the exception of chocolate, the flavors will rotate on a weekly basis. There are also the curiously named cheesecake sticks, the fondant au chocolat and clairs. \n\nThe puff itself is a marvel of choux pastry: flaky, buttery, and crunchy. The cream is also unique, and delicious. It is a not-too-sweet mixture of whipped cream and custard that the sign in Beard Papa's claims it takes two hours to make. You can see them scraping the vanilla bean pods, too, to extract the vanilla that flecks the cream in the vanilla cream puffs. I think this may be a new obsession for me.", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-05-14"}, {"excerpts": ["it was milk tea. which is better than strawberry for sure, but i was still so dissapointed to get stuck with a vanilla when i wanted pumpkin.

According to their website (best watched after you've ingested said cream puffs) the original inspiration of the cream puffs came from the original Beard Papa's .... shockingly, from his facial hair.  He also seemed to be smoking while baking these \"World's Best Cream Puffs\".  I'm not sure what the most disturbing part of those sentences are, but I'll leave that up to you to decipher.\n\nRegardless, the cream puffs are pretty damn amazing. I'm not normally a fan of puffed pastry seeded in custard and whipped cream, but stopping in was an unexpected treat.  I had the cookie crumb pastry with vanilla bean filling.  It was... awesome.

I've enjoyed BP in Japan, Singapore, Hollywood, Gardena, and now here in the Bay Area.  My opinion is purely my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own.  I'm just here to educate and answer questions raised on previous reviews.\r\n\r\nFYI...this is a long post and yes I have too much time on my hands =).  I base all my info on a 15min chat session with the manager of the Yerba Buena store and my personal experiences.\r\n\r\n1) Japanese vs French Puffs\r\nKeep in mind this is a Japanese style cream puff.  Hence the crispy shell, softer dough inside, and semi-sweet japanese Nama custard (custard and whipped cream).  I believe this is what makes the taste and texture unique.  French style puffs are softer and have a heavier, sweeter cream.  See #2 below for puff size differences.\r\n\r\n2) Napkins required?\r\nFirst of all, these puffs are big and a good amount of japanese style custard cream is purposely injected into the crispy shells.  Thus the flaky shell, amt of cream, and dusted baker's sugar leads to quite a mess.  If you saw the CNN Anderson Cooper piece on BP, the messy eating experience was one of the funny things they mentioned.  **WARNING...my opinion here** I personally feel you get quality and quantity in this pastry.  Because of the larger size puff and extra room for cream, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth and don't experience the sugar sickness afterwards because of the lighter, semi-sweet custard.  I couldn't consume french style cream in equal amounts...hmm now that I think of it maybe that's why French cream puffs are smaller. \r\n\r\n3) Pricey?\r\nSome may think $1.75 for a cream puff is expensive, but personally for me and my taste...I'd rather pay for a fresh, larger-than-norm BP puff than $3 for a Satura Cream Puff (decent, but not flaky...more bread like), $1.50 for a Ranch 99 Cream Puff, or $2+ for a behind-the-glass muffin/scone/danish at my local Starbucks.  But a BP puff does go perfectly with Starbuck's dark roast.\r\n\r\n4) Are they really fresh?\r\nShells are baked every 20mins and custard made every 2-3hours.  The puffs are never served hot or piping from the oven.  They need to be cooled out of the oven to get that flaky texture.  If the shells are not cooled properly or if the custard is pumped in too soon...moisture will soften the shells prematurely.  \r\n\r\n5) Why the lines?\r\nGoing back to #4 above, the lines primarily form when patrons are left waiting for the ovens to finish baking or when the puff are still in the cooling process.  Plus add in the marketing factor here.\r\n\r\n6) What's up with all the workers?\r\nEvery BP I've visited has had a Cream Puff line of workers so its part of the experience whether you like it or not.  Keep in mind, if they had fewer workers things might move slower.  But there is a difference between BP bakeries ambiance...I'll explain.  Have your ever been to a sushi restaurant where they greet you loudly in Japanese, proceed to shout orders, bow to you while saying Domo (sp?).  Well some BP's have this same experience where they greet/shout in Japanese which makes it more \"entertaining\"...purely my opinion here.  The Yerba Buena store is bland in this sense, but at least the workers are nice and courteous.    \r\n\r\n7) Other locations?\r\nThere are two more to be open this year...Redwood City and the SF Center a block away.  Is it just me or are the two SF stores a bit close?  Why not spread them out?  In any case, living in the Peninsula myself...I'll be a regular in the Redwood City spot.

The San Francisco store on the new Yerba Buena Lane is one of a few U.S. franchises; the others are in New York, New Jersey, Boston, Hawaii and Los Angeles. \n\nAfter we'd waited for about 10 minutes, one of the staff came down the line, apologized, and told us it would be 30 minutes before another batch was ready. Because we were only ordering one, we decided to stay, in hopes it would be quicker. \n\nBeard Papa is quite the scene. Besides the long line winding out the door, there's a lot going on inside. When you first step over the threshold, you're hit with this delicious buttery scent. You can see the puffs baking in these industrial-looking, high-tech ovens. They start off the size of a hockey puck, and then rise into a much larger, 3-inch puff. The staff, dressed chef's whites, forms an assembly line when the puffs are done cooling, with one person injecting the custard into the puff, the second dusting it with powdered sugar and placing it in a bag, and the third packing them into carrying boxes.\n\nThis place inspires some kind of weird fanaticism, and after having a vanilla cream puff, I have to say it may be merited. The people in line were mostly all Asian, as were all of the staff. A family with four little boys was taking pictures with one of the staff. Overhead, on two flat screen TVs, news clips about Beard Papa played; at one point, I looked up and saw Anderson Cooper on CNN eating a cream puff. The store sells T-shirts with its mascot --- an old, bearded man in a cap, and the saying, \"Who's Your Papa?\" This is probably temporary, but there was a sign saying \"Limit: One dozen per customer.\" \n\nThe menu over the cream puff area had \"Coming Soon\" taped over all of the selections, except the vanilla cream puffs. Under coming soon: cream puffs of different flavors --- chocolate, caramel, green tea, pumpkin, milk tea and strawberry. With the exception of chocolate, the flavors will rotate on a weekly basis. There are also the curiously named cheesecake sticks, the fondant au chocolat and clairs. \n\nThe puff itself is a marvel of choux pastry: flaky, buttery, and crunchy. The cream is also unique, and delicious. It is a not-too-sweet mixture of whipped cream and custard that the sign in Beard Papa's claims it takes two hours to make. You can see them scraping the vanilla bean pods, too, to extract the vanilla that flecks the cream in the vanilla cream puffs.

But, when I'm in the city I 80% of the time make a stop here for two reasons: one, the menu has expanded and they have a \"special\" daily flavor, my favorite so far being pumpkin; two, it just smells soooo good and I always feel like I should be rewarded for my small life efforts so I'll dish out for one or two pastries. I'll buy more if I'm visiting family because they're absolute die hard fans of the original vanilla Beard Papa's cream puffs.

The chocolate lava cake is absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS. They would ask you if you want to eat it right away, or would like to bring it home.
