I can't pretend I know what good Filipino food tastes like, so I can't vouch for its authenticity. It tastes very homey though, as if I were eating a home cooked meal with my parents. Filipino food seems to be all about heartiness so don't expect to find anything healthy here. Even any sort of vegetables are scarce, with food centering around meat.\n\nFood is ordered a la carte here, cafeteria style. If you're not familiar with Filipino food, you can just point at whatever looks appealing to you behind the glass. I had no idea what anything was, so I ended up pointing and asking what everything was. The lady helping me asked if it was my first time there, and when I said yes, she was kind enough to give me small samples of her favorite dishes to try.\n\nPrices vary depending on the type of protein/dish, averaging about $6 for small, $10 for medium and $13 for large sizes. Rice is $1.25. You can easily get a pretty filling lunch here for less than $10 with a small entree and rice.\n\nI went with 2 small entrees and no rice:\n\n* KARE KARE ($5.50, small)\nPork (knuckle I think?) in a peanut-based broth. The meat was a tad try, and the small size came with only 1 piece. I was expecting the broth to be thicker, but it was pretty thin and light in flavor.

Anyway - when I got there, they didn't receive the Eat24 order, talked about how they don't get the order, but that it would be on Maria's cell phone, etc etc.  Also more importantly, of the 4 things I ordered and paid for, 2 of the items were not available that day - which, again - had I looked, is totally understandable when knowing it's a steam plate / to go type of place.\n\nRather than go through the process of calling Maria and deal with the order, I showed them my receipt, and then I was able to substitute items to make up the same totals.   The ladies in there were super accommodating and helpful (even though I was a bit disappointed that I cldn't have 2 items I had been craving on my walk over).

I've been there 3 times during already. Had the pork adobo twice and the beef stew over steam rice and was quite pleased.The portions are quite big, they even offered  a bowl of soup too. I don't mind fish being fry right there because you know it is freshly cooked.  I'm trying the fried fish next time. The staff is courteous. Reasonable prices, main dishes are either $6 or $7, but  I rather  eat here than having a burger from Burger King or Carl's Jr. My only complaint is that the volume on the TV way too high.

I wanted a quick meal, so I went through Eat24, placed an order for pick-up and waited a bit.  I guess I should have looked at the photos, to better understand that it's essentially a steam plate restaurant so it wasn't necessary to do that.   Anyway - when I got there, they didn't receive the Eat24 order, talked about how they don't get the order, but that it would be on Maria's cell phone, etc etc.  Also more importantly, of the 4 things I ordered and paid for, 2 of the items were not available that day - which, again - had I looked, is totally understandable when knowing it's a steam plate / to go type of place.\n\nRather than go through the process of calling Maria and deal with the order, I showed them my receipt, and then I was able to substitute items to make up the same totals.   The ladies in there were super accommodating and helpful (even though I was a bit disappointed that I cldn't have 2 items I had been craving on my walk over).  Luckily I'm a glutton, and love to eat - so there were plenty of other options.  \n\nWhile not filipina myself, I grew up in Asia, and had home cooking at home often.  I ended up with Chicken Adobo, the mung beans stew (mongo), a stewed pork (i think it was binagoongan) ... and taro leaves in coconut milk - all in small sizes - along in with a side of rice.  so so so yummy.  For ME, everything hit the spot and took me 'home' to my childhood.  I was pleasantly surprised at the flavours and quality.  Perhaps it was because I was hungry, perhaps because it was just that good.  Hard to tell.  \n\nNeighbourhood is a bit sketchy - some might not feel 'comfortable' eating in the restaurant, though there is seating.  I took mine to go and ate in my room - and would likely have preferred to do that, simply because my room was more comfortable.\n\nAnyway - worth a shot.  Definitely don't bother ordering online in advance. There will not be a long wait, as it's pretty much ready to serve - and you never know what will still be available at any given time.\n\nEnjoy!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-07-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Favorites: laing, mongo beans, lechon kawali and chicken adobo."], "author": "Javid S.", "review": "Authentic filipino food, hella big portions, everything made with lots of love. \n\nFavorites: laing, mongo beans, lechon kawali and chicken adobo.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Noticing my small frame and apprehension to the mongo-load of rice she wanted to dish me, she conceeded to providing a smaller portion.
