I'm going to have to elaborate on this order because I found the best way to eat it.  It's tender, tart and creamy but not the milky creamy taste. More yogurt creaminess. It's an appetizer but I always ask for it to be served with my meal. It goes so well with rice, the red tart stuff, and raw onions. YES, the raw onion adds a sweet kick to the tart flavor. You'll thank me on the onion suggestion but not your significant other.\n\nThe only downside to this place is how pricey the soltani has gotten over the years. It was in the high teens back in the early 90s but it's over $30 now.  I don't mind paying for good meat, and it is supposedly filet mignon. However, I would rather eat filet mignon at a steakhouse.  Their koobideh is nearly just as good. For $19, you get a generous portion. Also, they used to provide complimentary feta cheese with the bread and sabze, but it's now extra charge for the cheese.\n\nI would give 5 stars if the prices are more reasonable or maybe if they brought back the feta cheese (lol, I know it's just cheese but I hate it when something is taken away).

This spread went really well with the pita bread provided. However, the portion size was pretty large so we really only got through half, trying to save room for our entrees....wrong move. About 30-40 minutes after we stopped picking at our appetizer, we noticed the waitstaff making more frequent visits to our table to \"check in\" - refilling water, rearranging the utensils, taking away plates....but never to update us on whether or not our entrees would (if ever) arrive. That's when we came to the conclusion that we probably were supposed to finish all the cheese first...\n\nI understand not wanting to \"rush\" patrons, but observation should have shown that we were pretty ready for our entrees...a simple question would have sufficed rather than constant checks. Eventually, we did receive our entrees (and we didn't even have to finish the cheese!) and what we ordered was really good!\n\nThe Shishlik was our runaway favorite! Done medium-rare, these lamb chops were impossibly tender with amazing flavor and just enough char. The order is delivered with 6 bone in chops - a great value too! Second favorite was the Khoresht Fesenjoon. Made of pomegranate and walnuts, you can really pick up on the fruity and nutty undertones in this \"sweet and sour\" sauce. The chicken was also fork tender. The Ghorme Sabzee was pretty good. The kidney beans mixed in with the onion, leeks, herbs, and lime was a nice touch...perfect accompaniment for the basmati rice in my opinion. The lamb shank was also fall of the the bone tender.

The atmosphere is first class, the service is too. And, for me, (as I am not an expert on Persian Cuisine) the food was delicious! \n\nYet, keep in mind fellow Persian food fans, Maykadeh is pricey! \n\nI was hesitant to go in because it was only me and no one else. Persian food is something to be shared and so it is best having it with family and friends. Yet, I was so hungry and I had a few hours before I was to meet up with friends at Davies for the SF Symphony performance. \n\nTo be honest, I had intended to eat very inexpensive. My aim was Golden Boy Pizza, which is nearby. But the line was all the way around the block. \n\nMost of the eateries in and around North Beach are expensive and they are for tourists. I am a local and did not want to get caught up in that. I figured if I am going to spend even a little bit of money, I might as well spend it on a place that is local and truly established. And, somewhere I could sit and enjoy my meal, not have to stand. I also wanted to be somewhere that was going out to a special place. But at the same time was a bit like home. \n\nMaykakeh has been in North Beach for years and it is one of the spots Persians and Persian-Americans go to have dinner and be with family. Whenever I go into North Beach I am often stuck with a bit of sadness because all of the family style Italian-American restaurants I remember as a little kid are gone. Caesar's, New Pizza, Capps Corner, the places I remember as family-style, they are all gone. All from another era. \n\nI watched as various groups arrived at Maykadeh; some dressed up and others more causal. \n\nBits of Farsi could be heard amid the conversations and as one elegantly dressed older couple drove up. They asked the parking attendant outside the door to park their car. I watched them and I wondered, \"are these expatriates? Would these be some of the people who escaped the turmoil that emerged in Iran in the late 1970s?\" \n\nThey looked distinguished, so glamorous, finely dressed. Persians are unique in their standards of dress and hospitality, compared to us Americans. For them it is important to always make guests feel like they are welcomed and honored. And, to dress up is a sign of respect as well as celebration.\n\nEven most of the causally dressed people had at least one or two pieces of clothing that were stylish and chic. In a way, their gathering reminded me of those old Italian-American restaurants I recall. It was when families gathered for a Sunday dinner.\n\nThe aroma of the saffron rice and the roasted lamb was alluring, if not beckoning. \n\nFortunately, the parking attendant was very persistent that I go in anyway and that yes, there is room for someone to dine alone. I sat at the little bar which is near the front door. Good thing I did because staff was making a \"Persian Martini.\" It looked scrumptious. \n\nStill, mindful that I would be going off to the Symphony later on, I figured I best stay with a reliable standard, a glass of Syrah. \n\nI had the kabob appetizer. Wow! The staff was so gracious they provided me with fresh baked bread,warm right out of the oven.  And, they gave me fresh a green salad with basil to go with my lamb/beef kabob. On the plate was also a fresh stewed tomato and onions. Oh so delicious! \n\nI should have ordered some rice to go with it, so to soak up the gravy on the plate. \n\nI had been to Maykedeh once before and enjoyed it. I had forgotten that it is a hub of happy gatherings and savory meals.\n\nI have been a Persian food fan for some time. Yes, even long before Anthony Bourdain's show (God Bless him, may his soul be at peace). \n\nSome years back, my nephew was dating a Persian-American girl from Sunnyvale. She introduced us to Persian food and all the Persian restaurants in the City. Albourz, Maykekeh and Lavash out in the Sunset, she took us to them all. We (my family and I, were instantly won over and have been fans ever since). \n\nPersian food is a delight for the senses and a taste sensation like no other. Well, yeah, there's Indian and Thai food. But Persian is made with that something special that sets it apart from all others. \n\nAnyway, back to my visit on Saturday night. I concluded my meal with Persian style Baklava and some Persian tea. Oh, so scrumptious! I wanted more. \n\nService was excellent as everyone there aims to please. Yes, I will go back. I have to go back to try that \"Persian Martini.\" But I will make sure I bring friends and family too.

It was very enjoyable but a little pricey not your daily stop for a quick bit kind of place.\n\nThe Soltani (skewered thin slices of filet mignon and skewered Koobideh i.e. lamb + beef, marinated in lemon juice and onion) was delicious, mouth watering and outstanding.  Highly recommended for meat kebab lovers.  You won't regret it.  Their Basmati rice was out of this world.\n\nBe sure to try their Persian Lady (vodka and pomegranate juice), the Persian tea, and the Makhlaut with rice stick.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-05-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Finally...the tea was a bit weak (for Persian tea anyway) but the coffee was great.

As far as Persian restaurants go this place is nearly as good as it gets.  Not only do they have the usual fare (kabbobs and so on) but they also have a variety of the more exotic stuff...prairie oysters, tongue, etc.  They also have a great selection of gholmes (stews) that you generally won't find at a lot of lower end Persian restaurants because they are labor intensive and expensive to make in small batches.  Even the wine list is nice.  The ONLY thing that I can say needs improvement is that like most Persian places, they don't have a decent bartender and can't make use of the full bar if you ask for a cocktail.  But then again, most people that go to a Persian joint usually just have wine with dinner.  Finally...the tea was a bit weak (for Persian tea anyway) but the coffee was great.  All in all though, it's a wonderful place.\n\n\nSepand Tehrani", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["I also had Persian tea, which was pretty good.\n", "And a yogurt drink...

Both times we ordered the Kashke Bademjan appetizer (eggplant and mint garlic sauce) - yum! Spread it on the warm flat bread they provide with a little bit of the basil that they also provide- it is to die for!  The first time I ordered the Ghorme Sabzee (Lamb shank cooked in finely chopped onion,leek, scallions, chives & herbs, dried lime, Basmati rice) - and the lamb was nice, tender, and did not at all land in your stomach like a rock. And we all know that lamb can be a hit or miss meat. The second time I ordered the Poussin \n(Baby chicken with all the bones marinated in onion, saffron,\nlime juice, vegetables and Basmati rice). The lime juice helps keep the chicken moist and tender - so you are not chewing on tough meat. I topped it off with a nice cup of hot Persian tea.
