Our delivery order arrived via Caviar a little past 11:30am.\n\n*Samosa: Two pieces, Deep fried pastry shells, stuffed with potatoes and peas ($4)\n*Tikka Masala: Chicken cooked in a tomato based curry ($9)\n*Stuffed Naan ($2 each): Onion Naan, Garlic Naan (+$0.50)\n\nAt work, we have a $20 limit for lunch. Price wise, Raavi was great as I was able to place my usual delivery order. (It's over $20 most of the time.) I noted the curry should be extra spicy and they listened. It had a nice heat. Both naan were soft with a nice chew. Though I did think both could have used more garlic and onion. The samosas were crispy and the filling soft. I did wish the mint chutney was more flavorful to add a contrast. It wasn't very minty. Also, there wasn't much of it.\n\nDefinitely a comforting meal. And all for $17.50.

They were not too soft. \n\nPlain Basmati: The rice was a little bit dry, but we got huge portions! \n\nIt was nice to see the pictures of some of the meals on the wall. The Butter Chicken that we ordered looked different from the image on the wall; our dish was much lighter and looked nicer, :p. \n\nThe employees placed the food on the table, but we were expected to pick up our own utensils. There were water cups near the side of the cashier register. At first, I thought that there was no ice since I just saw a large container of water.
