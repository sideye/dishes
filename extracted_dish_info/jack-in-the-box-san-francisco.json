I wouldn't say that the order was served real quick, but the wait time was neither too long.

It's average fast food. There's nothing about it that really stands out, in a good or bad way. When I go here I know my taste buds will be going \"meh\" with every bite, but at least my stomach will be happy. To their credit, the seasoned curly fries are pretty tasty, but I've yet to have a more than average \"entree\" here.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, this place is a major homeless magnet. But what makes it worse is that the employees do not care in the slightest. At all. I can't think of a single other business I've been to in this city (outside of the Tenderloin obviously) that is as tolerant of homeless people as this place. I bet they'd let them sleep on the tables if they tried, that's honestly how little they care.\n\nAs you can imagine, this makes the dining experience here horrible. If you come here, it's in your best interest to just get your food as quickly as possible and leave. It's okay during the day, but at night... well, let me put it this way. The last time I dined here at night, a bum stole a dollar from me because I didn't have my \"bumdar\" active when he asked for a dollar in exchange for 4 quarters, two homeless people came up to my friend and I during our meal to ask for some change, and during the 15 seconds it took me to get a straw, a homeless person managed to run down from the upper level, beg my friend for her milkshake, and leave with it before I got back. That experience may be a bit worse than normal but I assure you that it's very much a rarity to have a bum-free experience here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-03-25"}], "mini churros  pieces": [], "jr bacon cheeseburger": [], "fountain drink": [], "strawberry shake": [], "hamburger combo": [{"excerpts": ["I ordered a hamburger combo.

I knew i had some ground beef in the freezer... and some Cheeseburger Macaroni Hamburger Helper in my pantry.  I got all *sadface* when I realized I didn't have milk.  \n\nToday, I was elated to finally peep this JITB franchise, as I usually pass by this joint on my way to Katana-Ya.  Yes, I chose option two to cope.\n\nI asked Luis (a huge meat and cheese aficionado) to join me at JITB.  We synchronized our BlackJacks and met up at the corner of O'Farrell and Mason.  We've been talking about Ultimate Cheeseburgers and Sourdough Jacks in the past 48 hours, so it was exciting to know that we will eventually get satisfaction.\n\nI took the 6-Parnassus and got off on 6th and Market.  It was such a nice day for a stroll, so I walked up Mason, which was perfumed with the day's fresh sprinkling of urine.  I see Luis at the corner of the parking structure and we head up a block to JITB.\n\nHe was set on getting a sourdough jack and two-for-99cents tacos, and a regular-sized rootbeer.  I had a mac n' cheese lunch (craving for comfort food) and some curly fries, so I felt it would've been a daunting task to order a Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger, or a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger, or an Ultimate Cheeseburger.  I was almost tempted to just get the Grilled Cheese (off the Kid's Menu), but I had to stay focused and get a sandwich that had some meat.  I settled for a Sourdough Jack and a regular soda.  Asked for two packets of mayonnaise and we were set.\n\nLuis noticed that there was an upstairs dining area.  We ascended the stairs and marveled at how empty the area was.  There were fake floral arrangements everywhere, but the place was very clean and devoid of human presence.  We chose a cozy corner table, in front of one of three security cameras that monitored whatever activity at the upstairs area.  \n\nWe both agreed that this area was somewhat of a haven for vagabonds who may need a place to crash.  Speaking of vagabonds, a wise crack-head, with a bright turqouise 90s styled jacket and green pajamas (bedecked with Christmas bells prints), joined us upstairs.  He kept a distance, being careful not to cross whatever areas that can be captured by the security cameras.  Luis gave me the play by play, as I was not facing the dude. \n\nL: Grace, just keep eating your sandwich.  There's a guy right there who is changing his pants.\nG: I don't care.... can I look?\nL: well... yeah okay, he's done.\nG: oh.\n\nwe continue to eat.\n\nL: Grace, he has a shank\nG: (turns around)  wow.  I bet he's using it to cut up some coke or crack\nL:  yeah, he looks like he is cutting up something.\nG: oh yeah he is!  wow, i only heard of stories, but never really saw this stuff in action.  oh heck no, he is straight up sniffing some stuff.\n\nwe continue to enjoy our wonderfully-made Sourdough Jacks.\n\nL: Grace, he is smoking\nG: (thinking.... \"I can't smell cigarette smoke\") really?  I don't smell...\n     (turns around).... oh.... OH!!!  \n     (whispers).... you mean... crack?\nL: (nods)\n\nwe finish our food\n\nL: okay, he is straight up coming over here.... oh okay, he stopped.....  oh okay he's heading over.\n\nDude:  could you guys spare some money?\n\nL/G: sorry\n\nDude:  (makes : [  face)\n\nTIP OF THE DAY:  if you're a hobo or crackhead.... there are prime locations upstairs to do your thang (smoking or sleeping), with some limited privacy.  The areas adjacent to the staircases are actually not within the field of scope of the security cameras.  That is why Mr. Dude was successful at getting his fix.
