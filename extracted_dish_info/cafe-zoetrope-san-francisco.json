Justin Timberlake has Southern Hospitality, Eva Longoria has Beso, and Ashton Kutcher has Dolce, to name just a few. These Hollywood youngsters may be taking a cue from Francis Ford-Coppola, who has owned Cafe Zoetrope (formerly Cafe Niebaum-Coppola) in North Beach since 1999.\n\nCoppola's Italian eatery is nestled on the ground floor of Columbus Tower, the top floors of which house Coppola's American Zoetrope studio. The readers of California Home & Design recently voted Columbus Tower their favorite building in San Francisco, and it is truly spectacular at night, with the oxidized copper facade emitting a soft green glow that is starkly juxtaposed with the night sky, the bright lights of Columbus Street, and the silhouette of the nearby Transamerica Pyramid.\n\nWhile I've always been somewhat disappointed that you aren't greeted with a massive poster of The Godfather immediately upon entering, the inside of the restaurant is still a film buff's dream, with the walls adorned with movie posters, photos of Coppola himself, and various other pieces of motion picture paraphernalia. The back wall is lined with bottles upon bottles of different wines from Coppola's Napa Valley vineyard. There's a small red booth tucked into a corner of the restaurant which is reserved for Coppola in the event that he's in town and chooses to eat there, and it is literally roped off until the servers get the green light to seat other diners there. All in all, Cafe Zoetrope is one of those restaurants that, delicious food aside, is worth visiting just for the decor and atmosphere.\n\nThat being said, the food is nothing to sneeze at, either. At a post-movie dinner the other night, my fellow diners and I (happily seated in Coppola's booth!) started off with a bottle of the Sofia Coppola Blanc de Blancs champagne and the Picada Tray, which was filled with mixed olives, salami and prosciutto, four different types of cheese, and more. This was a perfect appetizer for a table of four, whetting our appetites for what was to come, but not filling us up too much.\n\nWhen it came to the entrees, I ordered the penne all'arrabbiata, which was met with an approving nod from our server. My fellow diners opted for the Argentine-style short ribs, spaghetti with veal and pork meatballs, and the spinach and ricotta \"malfatti\" dumplings in a blended tomato and cream sauce. I tried a bite of everyone's dish, and while I found the meatballs to be a bit dry, everything else was quite good. I personally think I had the winning dish, with a wonderfully spicy and flavorful arrabbiata sauce topping house-made penne, which was flawlessly al dente. The short ribs were cooked deliciously with a tasty chimichurri flavoring, and the oversized malfatti dumplings were soft and fluffy. Considering the quality of our entrees, the dessert menu was impossible to resist, so we all split a chocolate tartufo as the perfect ending to the meal.\n\nThe other night was just one out of dozens of times that I've been to Cafe Zoetrope, and it's never disappointed.

When I entered, I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, and I said no, I was here for lunch and preferred a table.  No problem, I was seated at a table, and sat there for the next 10 minutes waiting for someone to bring me a menu, or water, or acknowledge that I was there.  Never happened.  So I got up and searched someone out for a menu.  A few minutes later, I had a few questions for the server, which he answered.  When asked if he would recommend the short ribs, he said they were very fatty-about 50% fat-and gave me the impression that no, he would not recommend the ribs.  I asked about the special pasta of the day and he said it was in a very rich sauce, very heavy, and also gave me the impression he would not recommend it.  OK, so I asked about the special grilled chicken salad and the muffaletta.  He said both were good so that's what I ordered.\n\nI waited over 20 minutes for the salad.  I wasn't in a hurry, so that's OK, but given how slow the restaurant was, it seemed odd.  The people next to me, who came in after me and ordered after me, were already done with their pizza and I was still waiting to be served anything.  Well, hopefully the wait would be worthwhile.  It wasn't.  The chicken was cut into small greatly over-cooked pieces which had no flavor except dried out chicken.  And very skimpy on the amount.  There were also \"caramelized onions\" which were simply burned onions.  So $11 for a salad with maybe 1 ounce of dried out chicken, and a few pieces of burned onion.

Since both the building and bistro are owned by Francis Ford Coppola, whose American Zoetrope offices are situated above, the renowned director is often on the premises. The menu includes family recipes for mostly northern Italian favorites. One exception is the muffaletta - the classic New Orleans sandwich of mozzarella, ham, mortadella, and salami with an olive topping - a whole one of which easily can feed a family of four. Among the pasta options is an outstanding Penne all' Arrabbiata, with a spicy sauce comprised of tomatoes, olives, capers, and garlic. I haven't tried any of the wide array of pizzas, but the Calzone Ripieno, stuffed with tomatoes, mozzarella, salami, ham, mushroom, and artichokes, is excellent and large enough for two to share. Not surprisingly, the spotlight is on wines from Niebaum-Coppola in the Napa Valley.

To my surprise and delight our hostess greeted us at the door after a couple of seconds and was able to get us a little private booth for two in the right corner of the restaurant. It was a perfect little booth close to the bar but also with a window view to keep claustrophobia at bay.\n\nComplimentary bread with oil/balsamic is served and the male server brought our waters and menus out immediately. The menu has some interesting appetizers, pizzas, and the normal Italian fare. We were in the mood for pasta so I decided on the spaghetti with meatballs and my BF got the Linguini Vongole. To drink we went with waters and a tasting of 3 wines.\n\nWhile waiting for food we did some people watching and observed that the waitstaff seemed to be on their game for the most part. I read that some other reviews found the staff to be distant or cold, even rude, this was not our experience. Our main server was a bit dry but polite nonetheless and the others were perfectly cordial and friendly. The bar scene was interesting; this seems to be a trendy little watering hole for some of the locals and you are in such proximity to others due to the size of the restaurant that you cannot help but be part of their conversations at times. Definitely entertaining.\n\nThe wines arrived first (the pasta is cooked fresh to order and takes at least 20 minutes), we sampled a Syrah, a Malbec, and a Zinfandel which were all good. The Syrah was my favorite, although I would not call myself a wine enthusiast.\n\nWhen the food came, I could not have been happier with the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs are a house specialty and mixture of beef, pork, and veal which were delicious and the sauce was fantastic;very rustic but light and flavorful at the same time. My BF was not as much of a fan of the Linguini Vongole (with clams). The pasta was a bit more Al Dente than he prefers and the white wine butter sauce was a bit thin and did not really adhere to the noodle at all.

After perusing the wine list, I quickly realized it was a Coppolla restaurant - which was fine by me because I normally enjoy Coppolla's wines.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer (a cheese and meat plate) and when it came, the waiter just dropped it off and left. Now, normally, when I order some sort of sampler appetizer item (especially meat and cheese plates,) the server gives you a little detail on what he's laid in front of you. For example: \"This is a Chevre with herbs and blah blah from Oregon, this is a prosciutto di parma from blah blah and is one of my personal favorites....\" etc etc. You get the picture.\n\nWe then followed up with entrees.
