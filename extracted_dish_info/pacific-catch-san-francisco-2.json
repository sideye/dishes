There is also some cozy outdoor seating under some heaters, but keep in mind, it is right next to the bus stop. \n\nThey start you off with some complimentary shelled edamame and pretzel goldfish, which is a cute nod to the seafood menu, but I'd still prefer bread. I also think edamame is more enjoyable with the shell on.\n\n$16.50 Japanese Wasabi rice bowl w/ Hawaiian poke - seaweed salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori, soy-wasabi sauce:\nThe bowl has a decent portion of bite-size chunks of sweet, juicy tuna. The soy-wasabi sauce is mild and not too strong on the wasabi. It is also seasoned with green onions, chives, and sesame seeds. Everything tastes fresh including the pale slivers of creamy avocado and crunchy, crisp seaweed salad. Be sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite, otherwise you're left with a lots of rice at the bottom of the bowl. \n\n$15.50 Ahi Tuna Salad w/ seared ahi, greens & romaine, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, soy-wasabi vinaigrette:\nWhen I want something lighter, I'll go for the salad. The ingredients are pretty much the same, but with lettuce instead of rice. But with a salad, I go for the seared tuna instead of poke, because it creates the illusion of a meatier salad. Again, try to eat a little of everything together, otherwise you're left with a ton of greens, or as my friend calls it, 'rabbit food.'\n\nA lot of people like the sweet potato fries.

The menu features mainly California seafood dishes with some Asian fusion touches here and there. This corner venue is large and spacious with very high ceilings, but they keep the place pretty cold. There is also some cozy outdoor seating under some heaters, but keep in mind, it is right next to the bus stop. \n\nThey start you off with some complimentary shelled edamame and pretzel goldfish, which is a cute nod to the seafood menu, but I'd still prefer bread. I also think edamame is more enjoyable with the shell on.\n\n$16.50 Japanese Wasabi rice bowl w/ Hawaiian poke - seaweed salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori, soy-wasabi sauce:\nThe bowl has a decent portion of bite-size chunks of sweet, juicy tuna. The soy-wasabi sauce is mild and not too strong on the wasabi. It is also seasoned with green onions, chives, and sesame seeds. Everything tastes fresh including the pale slivers of creamy avocado and crunchy, crisp seaweed salad. Be sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite, otherwise you're left with a lots of rice at the bottom of the bowl. \n\n$15.50 Ahi Tuna Salad w/ seared ahi, greens & romaine, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, soy-wasabi vinaigrette:\nWhen I want something lighter, I'll go for the salad. The ingredients are pretty much the same, but with lettuce instead of rice. But with a salad, I go for the seared tuna instead of poke, because it creates the illusion of a meatier salad. Again, try to eat a little of everything together, otherwise you're left with a ton of greens, or as my friend calls it, 'rabbit food.'\n\nA lot of people like the sweet potato fries.

The verde sauce is on the runny side and is quite spicy.

It wasn't even until the third time did I realize they had a parking lot next to the restaurant! How handy! Such a rare find in San Francisco. \n\nFish & Chips: Everyone loves these but I don't think its their best thing there. You should definitely get 4 pieces though since its $14 and 2 pieces is already $10. The pieces of fish aren't that big. I love the sauces it comes with but the Jalapeno Tartar sauce was never spicy to me. I think the coleslaw side is far too small as well but I love their sweet potato fries (the only reason I wanted to come in the first place haha)\n\nCalifornia Roll Salad: I love this salad! Although I had it at every meal and I got kind of sick of it at the end. The salad is huge and you'll probably have a hard time finishing it. It comes with a ton of avocado and a even bigger mound of real crab. It really does taste like a california roll! I think its around $13. \n\nHawaiian Poke Brown Rice Bowl: I never would've thought of ordering this if it wasn't for Yelp! I'm eating it right now as I type. I had a ton leftover because it wasn't the best thing to eat yesterday morning hungover! By far my favorite thing from Pacific Catch. You can also get it with white rice or 1/2 rice & 1/2 greens. \n\nMochi Fondue: Nothing special. Just 3 mochi balls cut in half and a little bowl of tasty melty chocolate to dip it in. There was way too much chocolate in the bowl though and I felt bad for wasting it. I don't think its worth the money since it isn't very creative and you could just make the same thing yourself for far less. \n\nThere is never a wait when I go. My friend and I were about to get dinner at the Presidio location until we drove by it noticed how tiny and packed it was. We just drove all the way to the 9th street location. This location is huge. Service has always been nice as well.

It was pretty fresh, but the sauce was very sweet and seemed kinda creamy and citrusy. The wonton strips it came with was mostly folded and I could not eat it with the tuna. I probably would try something else next time.\n\nFish Tacos- \nI got the 3 taco platter plate to share. First off, I got the grilled Mahi-Mahi tacos. Kind of dry, to be honest, and pretty bland. The steak taco was pretty good! very filling! Then for the third taco, I got the shrimp one. The shrimp were pretty large and fried and it was my favorite taco out of the three.

The food was mediocre at the very best and forgettable.\n\nOn Friday, 5.27.11, I came to Pacific Catch for my friend's Birthday Dinner. We had reservations for a party of 14 at 7 pm. Upon arrival, it took about 5-7 minutes for them to set up our table and be seated.\n\nF O O D:\nThis time I did my due diligence and made sure I looked at the other Yelper's reviews to see what to order. The Poke and Sweet Potato Fries were overwhelming mentioned in many reviews, so I decided to entrust in my fellow Yelpers and I was not disappointed.

The thick chunks of tuna were uber fresh, tender and succulent. The soy wasabi sauce, albeit a bit salty, gave the tuna a nice savory sweet flavor with a hint of spice while the sesame seeds and roasted nori gave it a touch of nuttiness. The accoutrements of wakame salad, daikon sprouts, cucumber, and ginger were all very fresh and crisp. The brown rice, however, was undercooked and hard.\n\n*SWEET POTATO FRIES ($3.50 for a Side Order): DANGEROUSLY ADDICTING!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3bxO8T8U96uKu2numljjsw?select=neBvXM0nJIZivB8_tiEe7g\n\nThe fresh-out-of the fryer sweet potato fries were crispy throughout with a soft, fluffy center. The light sprinkle of salt brought out the natural sweetness of the potatoes. There were two accompanying sauces: Thai Sweet Chili and Wasabi Aioli. I preferred the Wasabi Aioli as it added a layer of creaminess with a slight nose tingle from the wasabi.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nVery friendly but slow which is understandable because we were in a large party and the restaurant was packed. Nevertheless, the staff did a good job making sure everyone got their entrees at the same time although the last three took 5 minutes longer than the others. I did have to ask several times for my water glass to be refilled so perhaps leaving a water pitcher for larger parties may be a good idea.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nContemporary and fun; Pacific Catch is good for casual lunch and dinners. Since it's a large restaurant, it's also good for large parties. The noise level is very, very loud though so it's very likely you'll have to scream across the table if you want to be heard.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nAlthough Pacific Catch has a small lot with a 10-car capacity, getting a parking space in that lot is like hitting the jackpot. Street parking is no easy task either so make sure to allot an extra 15 minutes to find parking. Your best bet is looking for parking at Golden Gate Park which is just across the street. \n\nThe is one of the few times that Yelpers didn't lead me astray, so if you're coming to Pacific Catch, definitely order the Poke and Sweet Potato Fries.

The good: fish tacos, sweet potato fries and their Happy Hour.\n\nThe bad: I was served a taco containing a 1/4\" chunk of hard plastic (nearly as hard as metal, not soft plastic). I discovered this on my first bite, and it hurt the hell out of my crown and upper tooth for many days.\n\nThe worse: when the \"manager\" came over to deal with it, she looked at the remains of what I had to spit out and said \"oh, that shouldn't be in there, we'll make you a new one,\" and that was it. No \"wow, are you hurt?\" or anything even feigning empathy.\n\nTo their credit, I did get a replacement taco that DIDN'T have a dangerous foreign object inside, that was awesome. Even more awesome after being ignored for the next half hour after food delivery was they took an entire twelve dollars off the bill for nearly requiring me to do an emergency visit to the dentist (or possibly the hospital had I swallowed). \n\nTheir response was appropriate for an instance where they served the wrong drink, not where they served contaminated and dangerous food that caused injury. We were stunned and almost amused at the level of their tone-deafness.\n\nThe \"real\" manager came by after we had paid and briefly discussed it then tried to take my money again. Then the kitchen chef came by and actually apologized and showed some empathy for what had happened, but at that point it was too little and far too late. But he was the one guy who seemed to give a damn about what their mistake did.\n\nI have given it a couple weeks before writing this. Wrote a note to to their corporate headquarters while still at the table and later received back some mumbo-jumbo that didn't really indicate they gave a sh_t. They also promised to get back to me but they didn't. \n\n-------\nUPDATE: Within a day of posting this review, I finally heard back from them (thanks, power of social media...). I'll bump it up a star just because I got the sense that management is aware of ongoing issues at this location and the guy was real with me. The food is decent, location good and prices reasonable, I would really like this place to succeed and never put anyone else through this (or worse).

He had a large party already booked but recommended I book 2 reservations and he would try to seat the parties close to each other. \n\nWe all adjourned in the bar area for drinks. The bartender was awesome, great customer service! We were then seated and Rob reserved  2 booths next to each other. It worked out perfect because we used 1 booth as the kids table and the other for the 8 adults. \n\nThere are peeled soy beans and pretzel gold fish on the tables to start munching. The menu rocks!  You can order sushi rolls, and sashimi for the sushi lover but for the not so seasoned raw fish eater there are teriyaki bowls and great specials available as well. I started with the seaweed salad and clam miso, so good. The table ordered the fried calamari which was liked by everybody. Watch out!  It comes with a spicy creamy dipping sauce which was received well, but it is hot! \n\nThe tacos were a favorite of the group. Each taco has a different fish, mahi mahi, cod and salmon. They come with sweet potato fries, yum! I had the Surf and Turf, for 19.95, amazing!  The surf was shrimp with 2 skewers loaded, about 6 shrimp to a skewer. The meat was seasoned and juicy, very good. The entree also came with fried shoestring onions and pineapple fried rice, you have the option to substitute for plain brown rice. Large portion and great price! \n\nThe staff brought out a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl. I didn't try any but I have a pic I'll attach.

The food is good while offering many healthy options, the prices mostly reasonable, the feel is spacious, clean and stylish, and there's even a small parking lot by the side of the building with free parking for patrons...it's hard not to love this place!\n\nThis place doesn't add anything special to the neighborhood from a culinary standpoint, since it's another Asian Fusion place on the same block with three (yes, THREE!!!) other Japanese restaurants and within a block or two of several more sushi bars and fish restaurants...and arguably there's something formulaic and trite about the intentional hipness of the decor...\n\nBut there's also something to be said for dining in comfort, which is exactly what whoever designed and decorated this restaurant seemed to have in mind:  the lighting is mild and pleasant, the ceiling vaulted, giving the overall feeling of weightlessness, and the chairs and booths are mostly comfortable...although the booths will feel slightly cramped if you are very tall or have a big butt or tummy, since the tables are low and there's a non-removeable 1/2-height cushion behind your back that takes up about 5-6\" of your rump room.  If you are under 6' tall and on the slender side, you'll be just fine.\n\nThe servers are very friendly and attentive, which is a pleasant departure from many restaurants in San Francisco, where courteous service sometimes seems to have been otherwise forgotten in the shuffle.  Pacific Catch seems to operate the way many serious, highly rated professional restaurant environments do, with a highly trained staff, attention to detail overall, and a menu that reflects modern trends.  For example, this menu offers not only foodie versions of Miso soup, but also a brown rice substitution option for those of us watching our waistlines or simply attempting to eat a more healthy diet.  \n\nI recommend the coconut skewered shrimp and ordering anything that will get you some of their delicious sweet potato fries (healthier than regular fries, at least!)!  Be warned that you won't be able to eat just one...\n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed their salmon teriyaki bowl which came with shitake mushrooms, asparagus cut into the perfect size bites, and bok choy which was cooked to perfection, served over brown rice that's been dosed with some more of their flavorful teriyaki sauce (normally it's served with pineapple fried rice, but I opted for their complimentary brown rice substitution instead).\n\nTheir traditional miso soup is average at best, and at twice the price that other Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood will charge for the same size bowl, it's nothing special and you get the feeling it's pricier because everything on the menu is priced a little higher, not because of an increase in quality.  Still, the presentation of the bowl, which arrived covered and was quickly de-topped by the server at the table, gives at least some clue as to what your money buys here:  a higher end experience, even if it's at a chain restaurant, even if the menu looks like a mash-up of Sushi-Bar-Meets-Fish'n'Chips-Joint, even if it's a Monday night in the Inner Sunset.  \n\nThere's something to be said for a restaurant that does what it does well.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-02-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Ceivche - Too limey, not enough chips\nSweet Potato Fries - YUMMM\nCatch of the Day - YUM\nTeriyaki bowls - TOO SWEET, sickkk\n", "Any Tacos - Mediocre (go to Nick's Crispy Tacos instead)\n"], "author": "Heidi C.", "review": "This review is for both the Marina district and 9th Ave locations.\n\n9TH AVE -- accommodating for a huge party (takes reservations)\nMARINA -- the whole restaurant seats maybe 20 at a time.

The salad was a bit interesting with mixed greens and Romanians top off with some Japanese style shredded green seaweed with the soy-wasabi sauce too.  I am a fan of brown rice and there brown rice is made perfect, not to soft or hard.  If you are not a fan of wasabi, I would not recommended because it is a little bit mild spicy.

I had the following in the order of favorite to least favorite:\n\nAsparagus & Shiitake Roll: It was an interesting vegetarian take on a sushi roll and I found the asparagus tempura and the tiny strings of mushroom and carrot to be quite lovely.\n\nThai Coconut Shrimp: It's funny because when I had my first bite, I was like \"OMG...it feels like a Thai restaurant in my mouth.\"  Now looking at the menu as I write this entry, the dish's name is quite befitting. The coconut flavors are so quintessentially Thai.  I loved the crunch of the crispy coconut flakes and the juicy shrimp.  Frankly, I ended up just eating the coconut flake outer layer instead of the shrimp because it was so good.  The sweet and sour dipping sauce (that you can buy at any Asian market) was a nice complement. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: This roll was actually spicy, which I appreciated.  It was yummy with the bitterness of the daikon sprouts.  \n\nHawaiian Poke:  This was a disappointment as everyone had been raving about it.  Mainly because the poke tasted so gummy.  It did not simply melt in my mouth and the chopped green onions were a bit too overpowering.  I do like my poke to be marinated for a few hours so that the fish really soaks up the flavors but I just felt it had been marinated too long.  And the crispy chips started to give me a headache...which I get when I eat too much fried food.  Disappointing.\n\nSpicy Cabo Calamari:  Pretty good but nothing too spectacular.  It was interesting that they also deep-fried slices of lemon and peppers.  The peppers were really yummy and SPICY...hehe...I attempted to eat the lemons too, but I suggest you not do that.      \n\nThe food is pretty good and very well priced. They also played good music...love Bob Marley. :) I think I hyped myself up for this dining experience as I hadn't been here in a long time.  I probably won't go for a few months.

My friend and I wanted sushi and our moms wanted fish and chips or ceviche so we came here.\n\nI was surprised the restaurant wasn't more crowded on such a beautiful day. We got a table outside and sipped beer and pisco sours in the warm sun. My friend's mom did not like her pisco sour martini, she said it tasted like it was made from a mix. Well, in all fairness it was a pisco sour *martini* so it was not going to taste exactly like a pisco sour. She is from Chile and a connoisseur :)\n\nI ordered the shrimp tempura sushi and my friend got the spicy tuna and a vegetarian roll. The rolls are huge and definitely well priced for 8 pieces ($7.00-8.00.) They drizzle a mayo-like sauce on them so if you're a purist I would suggest skipping the sauce.\n\nWe got the sweet potato fries and they were just as good as everyone else has commented here. I've never had bad ones so I have nothing to compare them to. I loved the horseradish dipping sauce they served with them. I'd like to come back just for drinks and appetizers sometime.\n\nMy friend's mom got the shrimp ceviche which was very good. It was loaded with cilantro and avocado. It came with corn chips for dipping. My mom got the fish and chips and was very happy with hers. Overall, everything was delicious, fresh, flavorful and satisfying. \n\nThe service was great too. Our table was tiny but we had two servers helping us rearrange things to get everything to fit.

Chestnut St. is just way too tiny and crowded, though that might result in the food tasting better because you had to fight so hard to park/get a table. Corte Madera's location is too embedded in the outdoor mall scene and has way too many kiddies running around. But this 9th Ave. location is pretty much perfect with plenty of seating for the bar and regular dining area. It also has its own parking lot so you don't have to compete for the street meters. \n\nFood is pretty consistent at all locations. You can count on the fact that mostly everything you order from the regular menu will be very good. Some of my favorites are the wasabi bowls (with brown or sushi rice) and any of the fried seafood baskets. I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. SO GOOD. Everything comes freshly fried with those awesome sweet potato fries. But eat everything while they are fresh! I don't recommend taking leftover fries home. They really those their flavor after they've cooled down. \n\nThough their sushi roll selection lacks raw fish, I think they are still made very well with the mostly cooked ingredients. One of my favorites and one that DOES have raw fish is the Rising Sun roll. It has tempura shrimp and avocado wrapped in ahi tuna with a citrus sauce. I don't like that they stuff pickled ginger into the roll but if you're like me, just request that they leave it out. Otherwise it's a very tasty roll. The ahi tuna is always fresh and flavorful.  I love that they give you big pieces of it too. (We got that roll totally F-R-E-E! with the coupon in the Green Zebra book!) I could dine happily on their sushi rolls alone. \n\nJust recently I ventured off from my regulars and tried one of the their specials: Trout bbq'd baja style so it was spice rubbed and grilled, served with tomatilla avocado sauce, some thin slices of veggies, and fresh grilled corn over sweet potato fries. I could tell the fish was very fresh but for me, it was TOO seasoned and got a little salty since the fish wasn't very thick. And though I had originally wanted the fries, I would now have preferred and wished that the fish was served over rice. I think I'll stick to my regulars next time. \n\nBig pluses:\n-I've talked to the workers and seen for myself that Pacific Catch is environmentally conscious. They use biodegradable materials, from the takeout containers to the straw in your drink. Pacific Catch also practices composting from their kitchen to the leftover food scraps. Smiles all around. =D\n-I don't know anywhere else that you can get UNLIMITED refills on Thai iced tea. I could drink three glasses easy.

The spicy tuna roll was OK, but everything else was heaven.  It also helps that there's $3 pints and $4 well drinks.  NICE.  \n\nThe service is attentive and friendly.

The manager working that night was very apologetic about out previous visit and went to great pains to make sure we were taken care of.\n\nThis time, I'm pleased to report that PC lived up to the expectations we'd initially gone in with.  No shards of glass this time. Of course, that's sort of to be expected, but I think our second visit was probably more representative of the typical PC experience and the 4 stars were definitely well-deserved.

Again my only criticism here was the sauces. The ponzu wasn't as tart as I would have liked and the aioli definitely could have been punched up a couple of notches.

Aside from the bok choy which was very al dente and very difficult to eat (it should have been pre-cut or served with a steak knife- it was very hard to cut with a butter knife and too large and stringy to just take a bite), her meal was excellent. The fish and rice went together beautifully and he bok choy would have been a nice complement if it had been less cumbersome to eat.

Grilled Salmon with artichoke and a layer of tomatos\nDessert:\nMochi ice cream fondue with vanilla, coffee and chocolate flavored ice cream\nDrinks: Sparkling white wine\n\nThe portions were pretty good sized for $65 for 2 people.  The firecracker roll was rather large, but if you look closely, it's a lot of rice wrapped in them.  It still tasted good though and didn't come out looking all sloppy like some restaurants make their sushi.  I really liked the ahi 3-way.  The seared kinds were better and more buttery than the poke, which to me was kind of chewy.  Not exactly the way I pictured poke.  But every other piece was fine.  My husband had the salmon and said he wished he picked something else.  Salmon is salmon - nothing special, but cooked really nicely - not overcooked, just right.  \nDessert was really good.  I love chocolate and I like mochi ice cream on a stick.  This was just right.  \nThe wine was definitely not the best.  I think with our chosen food, the wine just ended up tasting sour.

The salad on the side was not to my liking. I don't know what it was, but the flavor was horrible and the texture was really tough. \n\n- Korean BBQ Steak: First of all, the waiter hadn't asked my boyfriend how he wanted it cooked.

Mix them together...its perfect!\n\nSalmon Wasabi Bowl:  I thought it was going to be raw salmon but it turned out to be grilled. Apparently the raw stuff is the Hawaiian Poke?  How the hell was I suppose to know that??!!  I wish there was a description on the menu.  Boooo!!  Even though I was in the mood for raw fish the salmon was a great compliment to the brown rice covered with a wasabi miso sauce, radish sprouts, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, pickled ginger and avocado.  It was all the ingredients to a honkin sushi roll but in a bowl.  For about $15, the portions were huge, fresh, and tastey.  I probably ate a little less than half and was STUFFED!  \n\nTuna Wasabi Bowl: Same condiments in the bowl just with lighly seared tuna.\n\nI think I was a little disappointed that the salmon was cooked, obviously my fault, but I still enjoyed my meal.  Looking around at the other tables and their selections, the wasabi bowl was probably the best priced dish.  The menu will definitely bring me back to finalize their rating.

Pacific Catch on 9th lived up to and exceeded our expectations based on our experiences at the Corte Madera and Marina locations.\n\nWe like our poke bowls and didn't stray from our typical ordering.  The poke bowls arrived and were perfectly made.  The poke was fresh, abundant, and authentic (confirmed by the Hawaiian at our table).  It went well with the accompanying seaweed salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, shredded cucumber, and pickled ginger.  The sweet potato fries also hit the spot.  We had some wine and beer but it was too early to have a hard drink from the full bar.  I do look forward to trying their cocktail menu though.\n\nIt seems to be a huge staff.  The waiters seemed a tad nervous but the hostesses, general manager, and head chef were pros.  Overall, service was nice, happy, friendly and attentive.  But granted, it's an opening and to be expected.  We hope they can maintain it.\n\nIt was nice to see that they made good use of the enormous Canvas Gallery space.  There are plenty of comfy booths and tables all around and many counter seats are also available by the kitchen.  The bar is set off and mostly faces Lincoln and the park, which will help to siphon off the expected noise and buzz.  There is also a section by the 9th Street side, which can probably be closed off and booked for private parties.\n\nThe design is warm and inviting, similar to the Corte Madera location.  We liked all the bamboo too.  Good feng shui.\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood, Pacific Catch.\n\nP.S. And to everyone that got annoyed I reviewed this location before it opened, well, hey, tough.  Chalk it up to my rational exuberance.  And c'mon, there are more things in life to have snits about.\n\n6/20/2007\nHow funny.  I had gone to the Pacific Catch in the Marina earlier this month and whined on Yelp about how they should open one in Inner Sunset  (see review on 6/3/2007).

Since I had a $20 Opentable cheque to use and some friends actually said good things about the new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.  Oh and also, nothing seems to be open on Easter Sunday for dinner and we desperately needed to take a friend out for his birthday. \n\nWe had a reservation for 6:30 and one of us was very late, but the hostess and waitress gave us no grief and didn't make us feel guilty at all.  That's a giant plus for me.  It didn't seem like a lot of people made reservations, as our table was the only visible one with the sign \"reservation\" on it.  \n\nThe decor, well, I get it, it's Hawaiian themed.  The color is a bit loud for me and made the space look much smaller than its actual size.  I am glad they retained the high ceiling that I loved when it was Canvas, and we were all in awe that we were sitting where the middle bar used to be.  One thing I really didn't like was the carpet.  It was just ugly.  I don't see why they couldn't do some sort of chic hardwood floor.  And the noise level---it sounded like Happy Hour with a hundred suits packed in some Financial District bar at 5.  \n\nOur waitress was prompt and friendly and efficient.  Our dishes arrived timely.  Among the three of us, we had a basket of sweet potato fries, which was enormous (I mean, it doesn't look like much but sweet potatoes can be dense!)  I don't think anyone can mess up on sweet potato fries, so I was happy.  The sauces were pretty good, but I prefer to eat them without anything.  \n\nI had an unsweetened iced tea, which reminded me of the iced tea from the Grove.  Meaning, it's good---fruity aroma but not actually really sweet.  My boyfriend had a glass of sake.   Our friend had a mojito, which looked really good. \n\nWe wanted to get some grilled corn but apparently they ran out, cuz it was a nice day and therefore everyone ordered corn (our waitress' explanation).  But she came back and told us the kitchen managed to find a piece so they will throw that in our dish.  Free corn?  I was thrilled.  But it was just okay.  I imagined it to be that famous Mexican grilled corn from Cafe Habana in New York, but nope, just your ordinary slightly charred, buttery, hard corn.  Kinda disappointing.\n\nFor entree, I had the ahi poke wasabi bowl.  I am not a huge wasabi fan, but I do enjoy wasabi noodles from the House and thought it might be a subtle flavor like that.  It basically came as a giant bowl with every ingredient you can find in a tuna roll, but deconstructed, and enlarged.  I didn't think the rice was flavored enough to be called \"sushi rice.\"  But the ahi poke was delicious and the soy-wasabi sauce was pungent and flavorful.  Did I mention it's giant?  After my indulgence on sweet potato fries and a piece of corn, I could only finish a quarter of my rice bowl.  I think it'll be good as left over. \n\nThe other two had the specials, sturgeon and some other fish---I can't remember!  Both fish dishes looked just alright to me that I didn't even feel tempted to try them, but they both claimed that the dishes were good.  So I will take their word for it.  \n\nWe also shared a macadamia nut brownie with ice cream.  It was nice and sweet, and comes in a good portion for sharing.  \n\nThe restaurant was packed around 6:30 but by the time we left at 9, it was practically empty.  Sorta surprising to me that people ate so early.  I was glad that no one pressured us to leave long after we ate everything and paid and sat around.

Their sushi rolls are average, and nothing spectacular...\n\nI tried their soup special one day... I forget the actual name of it, but it was similar to a ciopinno.  It was a tomato based soup with seafood.  The broth was very flavorful!  There was plenty of content in the soup too.  I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it!!  The soup cost about $12 though.  But very delicious.  It's something not always on their menu.\n\nTheir fish and chips were very good, comes with about 3-4 pieces depending on what combo you get...  The fish was fresh.  I also got a fish special of the day.  The fish was cooked nicely, and not overcooked.

Again, here is another place that overloads on the sodium to masque the taste of their food. Not only was the fish too salty, but there was something fishy about the fish. After a while, I decided to cease my \"chow down\" and wrapped the food back into the bag. There is a huge problem if I order food and do not devour the entire thing. This means I either am not hungry or the food does not taste good. Thinking that I must not have been hungry, I decided to eat the bowl later that day. From the moment I went to my bfs house to later that afternoon, my stomach was hurting. I assumed it was due to the hangover from B2B, but it did not make sense. I went to go finish the bowl and figured out my stomach was hurting from the food. Pretty sad. The bowls used to be enjoyable.\n\nWhat I have eaten here: \nBaja Shrimp Ceviche\nSweet Potato Fries (Get them!)\nCabo Calamari\nSeared Ahi Bowl\nHawaiian Poke Bowl\n\nI'll keep the rating 3/5 because this could have been the one bad experience. I was always a fan of Pacific Catch, but I may need to take a permanent break from them.

It reminded me of the Korean dish bibimbap but this in a Japanese/ Hawaiian fusion version. You have a choice of white rice, sushi rice or brown rice.  And you can also have it with half salad half rice instead of full rice.  It is a big bowl for its price and can definitely be split into at least 2 servings.   The tuna was well seasoned and the rice had a great wasabi soysauce all over it.  We also order a small side order of sweet potato fries.  It's sweet potato fries.

Anyways, I am writing this review after my last visit there on a Thursday night (after my mouth watered from staring at the fish in CA Academy)....I went around 9 pm and Pacific Catch was pretty packed.

As we were all finishing up our food, one of my friends was drinking waster out of his glass...when all of a sudden I see a big splash. At first I thought he dropped his glass of water but it turned out that the bottom of his glass broke and all the ice and water spilled out! And let me just tell you...it broke just on the bottom of the glass in almost a perfect, complete circle! How weird is that!?! Luckily he already finished his meal. We, of course, complained to our server and he was able to get his meal for free. He mentioned that it probably happened because the glass was hot when they poured in cold water.\n\nNow for dessert...always my favorite part! The four of us shared 2 different plates....the mochi fondue and the fried dulce de leche spring rolls. Both were scrumptious!

The place wasn't crowded when we came so we didn't have to wait for a table, which is always nice.  We saw one table had ordered the Baja Shrimp Ceviche so we decided to start with that.   The presentation was really cool.  The ceviche, stuffed full of shrimp and avocado, was served in a tall martini glass with a pile of tortilla chips sprawled around the base.  The best thing about this dish was how much shrimp they gave us!  It's always annoying when you pay a premium for a shrimp entre and get 3 shrimp.  We counted each shrimp as we were going through the ceviche, they were good sized shrimp mind you, and ended up with almost 20! The chef was overly generous with the shrimp for the price we payed.\n\nFor my entre, I went with 3 tacos; 1 BBQ salmon with corn salsa and lime crema, 1 tropical grilled shrimp with mango salsa, and 1 spice-rubbed grilled mahi mahi with avocado tomatilla salsa.  Now let me first say that I am a little biased when it comes to fish tacos.  I've been a long time advocate for Wahoo's fish tacos and nothing has ever compared to their tacos.  Pacific catch however served me some really tasty fish tacos, which can definitely compete with Wahoo's.  I really appreciated the nice quality of salsas and toppings that went into the tacos.  They worked well and tasted great with the various fish and shrimp pairings.

Now, ask anyone close to me, and they will affirm that my palette is adamantly of the anti-salad mode, but Pacific Catch's hawaiian poke salad has converted me.  The salads are HUGE, comprised of a generous helping of rare hawaiian poke atop a bed of mixed greens garnished generously with slices of avocado, a handful of baby tomatoes, a healthy sprig of daikon sprouts, shredded carrots in a joyous, unassuming soy-wasabi vinaigrette.\n\nIf you're doubtful that the salad won't quench your appetite, order a side order of their sweet potato fries to push you just over the edge.

W-O-W!!  That's all I have to say.  It was a sweet perfection of texture and flavor that honestly, you won't comprehend unless you experience it yourself.  The warmth of the deep fried outside and the contrast with the vanilla ice cream that it's served with is an absolute wonder in the mouth.

Breaded on the outside and when you bite into, it's soft, not quite slimy, and very good!! We could have done without the so-so fish, and the coconut shrimp)\nLast but not least, we also had:\n-today's special appetizer - seafood in sauce(i love sauce) with a piece of very crispy bread that was grilled and tasted excellent dipped in the seafoody sauce, and it was topped with some spicy mustard that gave some surprising zing)\n\nOur family also shared:\n-Hawaiian Poke (very good. many pieces of poke with little chips to eat with it, though the poke was a little salty)\n-Baja Shrimp Ceviche (this was great. tortilla chips with the sour sauce tasted good. and there were many large shrimp we kept discovering beneath the sauce too)\n\nOther family members had:\n-Pineapple fried rice - apparently not very good\n-Shrimp taco - tasted ok\n-sweet tea - basically just sweetened tea\n-spicy fries - not too special\n-shrimp tempura roll - nothing special. the tempura just didn't do much for me\n\nAND, because my family had 3 birthdays, they comped 3 desserts for us! We got two Mochi Fondues, that come with the ice cream mochis in chocolate, vanilla, and coffee flavors to be dipped in warm chocolate sauce. I had the vanilla and that tasted pretty good. We also had the Macadamia Nut Brownie Sundae. I had a bite, and it was good, but just too sweet for my taste.\n\nAlso, the service was interesting. They kept collecting our chopsticks, and once even collected plates they gave my sister and I to use to share our food. We hadn't even used our chopsticks (2nd set) and plates yet! So our food came, and we're like...where are our plates AND our chopsticks! So I was onto my 3rd pair of chopsticks. After that, every time they came by, I held onto my chopsticks.

So Pacific Catch has an upscale look and feel to the place. Nice decor, lighting and a friendly wait staff.  But the menu is not vegetarian friendly.  Lot of choices (sake salmon, calamari, thai coconut shrimp, tuna tataki etc etc...) if you like your meats and fish but not if you're vegetarian.  Most places in SF by now have a section on their menu for vegetarians. Not here. (Btw, I asked the waiter and she didn't have a suggestion off the menu for me as well)  Frustrated, I asked for peanut butter & jelly sandwich and they didn't have that.

She didn't give us nearly enough attention.  She barely served our table.  In the beginning, we asked for water and she completely forgot about them.  We had to ask another server to bring it for us.  The waitress only took our order then another server basically brought us our food and waited on us.

However, I found that I was very much disappointed by several things, which are enough to deter me from coming back here.  \n\n1.  The prices are higher (possibly for the ambiance)\n2.

We recommended this place to our friend who liked it too.  The only complain they had was that everything on the menu is fish but that was fine with us.\n\n1/1/2008: This is the 2nd time I've been here and I would still give it a 4 star.  We had reservations at 7pm for 7 people and they seated us late for about 10 mins and they comped all our appetizers, without us complaining or mentioning it at all.  Now that's a restaurant that cares about their customers.  It was a pleasant surprise and treat.  The service was great throughout the meal as well.  \n\nWith 7 people, we tried alot more different dishes.  \n\nAppetizers:\n1) Shrimp ceviche - They were whole shrimp and there were lots of them.  I think they should dice up the shrimp because it was served with tortilla chips and there's no way you can get a whole shrimp on the chip.  But the taste was decent overall, nothing spectacular so I probably won't order it again\n2) Grilled artichokes - Fresh, good, seasoned properly.  Would order it again.\n3) Calamari - very good, came with fried lemon slices too which is an interesting touch.  the sauce was a little spicy.  Would recommend trying this and I would order it again.\n\nRolls\n1) CA roll - good that it was real crab meat, not some doughy fake ones.  There was too much rice which will fill you up quickly.  I prefer less rice.  Probably would not order it again just because I don't think this is not a signature dish.\n\n2) Rock 'n roll - Too much rice, couldn't find/taste the unagi (bbq eel).  Again, it tastes ok, but wouldn't order it again.\n\n3) Firecracker roll - We had this last time, loved it.  This time it was still good.  For some reason, this roll doesn't not have as much rice as the other too, which is good.  Would order it again\n\nEntrees\n1) Mahi mahi fish of the day - came with grilled veggie, sweet potato fries, mahi mahi served with tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish had a cajun spice rub that was a bit pungent.  The sweet potato fries as always was great.  Grilled veggie - can't go wrong with this.  Don't like the spice rub so won't order it again\n\n2) Grilled shrimp teriyaki bowl - Very tasty, great teriyaki sauce.  Liked that it came with veggie and mushroom, chopped and mixed into the rice.   Would order it again\n\n3) Ono fish of the day - very good.  came with fried onion rings that were delicious.  came with pineapple fried rice which everyone loved.  the fish was grilled on banana leaf so it had a great aroma and taste.  would order it gain.\n\n4) Organic chinook fish of the day - it came with grilled artichoke and brown rice and the fish was served with a tomato sauce.  it was fresh and decently good.  i'm not a big grilled salmon fan so that's why i won't order it again. \n\n5) Grilled Korean beef (another daily special) - I don't eat beef so I can't comment, but my husband thought it was decent.  This place is called \"Pacific Catch\" so I'd stick with the fish but if you have a friend that doesn't like seafood, at least there is an option to have meat.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place and would go again.  Good atmosphere for couples or groups.  Great service.  Nice decor and clean.  Lots of cocktails, decent size wine list.\n\n2/14/08: This is visit #3.\n\nCocktail Review:\nSun Burn - average; menu says there's a tropical syrup in it which I think is what gave it a little after taste of some sort.\nSome cocktail with Gin 209, kiwi and cucumber juice - DELICIOUS!  We had to order a 2nd one.  \n\nHouse salad - Good size, very fresh greens, salad dressing was yummy, if you like a Japanese type kinda dressing w/miso; The mushrooms that were in the salad was delicious.  They're cooked in some sauce, not some uncooked mushroom.\n\nCatch of the Day Fish and Chips - The ling cod fish and chips is the freshest fish and chips we ever had.  It's lightly fried, lightly crispy and covered in a thick batter where you eat a lot of batter and not fish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and fresh and was juicy.  The sweet potato fries as usual, are always yummy!!!\n\nSalmon and mahi mahi taco: Both were good and fresh.  The salsa on each one are good.  The salmon one has a spicy kick to it so if you like spicy, try that.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-12-29"}, {"excerpts": ["The sweet potato fries were ok.

The d\u00e9cor was marine themed, and the place appeared clean. Being my first visit here, and sitting in one of the booths I had an impression that they may have some kind of identity confusion. I don't know if it was because the name gave me the assumption they were a California Cusine restaurant with a slant of seafood offering, or the extensive menu that included American entrees, alongside Japanese items like sushi, teriyaki, and Mexican with the tacos. The edamame they served as soon as we were seated tells me they are Japanese. Maybe it was the Hawaiin entrees, or the fact that the visible cook staff was completely Hispanic, except for the one white guy calling out orders at the pass. Mexliforniapanese Dining. Nah, doesn't have the right ring to it. \n\nWe were disappointed in the ahi tuna poke appetizer. The ahi was fresh enough, but the seasoning was monotone, and overdone. There is no evidence of poke seasoning. Just soy sauce with bits of red and green onions. I love salty foods, but even I thought this dish was too salty, and finishes flat.\n\nOur entrees were Wasabi Ahi Tuna sandwich, and the Mixed Catch Basket. The Ahi Sandwich was over-seared (see Medium Well), and missing any kind of a wasabi bite. It tasted good, with the avocado slices providing a nice buttery texture for the sandwich and a somewhat experimental addition of pink ginger slices (yes, the same ones served alongside sushi) that didn't do much. It was an okay sandwich, for what its worth. I couldn't help but think this was some deli's version of a sushi on a french roll - take a roll, replace rice and seaweed with bread. The Mixed Catch Basket was served with sweet potato fries. It was the probably the best component of the dish. You couldn't go to far off track with fried foods, and this basket was no exception. Good, but nothing worth writing about. I should stop here.\n\nThe coleslaw that accompanied our entrees were suprisingly good. It was a light cream dressing with a distinct Korean-type pickling tang I detected. It was light and palette refreshing.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience. The place is nice to be in, be seen in, but not particularly nice to eat. I'll probably be back only when we are doing something in the park, and want to hit a bar...

We were both surprised to find whole shrimp in the ceviche.  It was a refreshing dish, but could've used a little bit more flavor.  I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Surf and Turf.  The asparagus had to be substituted with bak choy cause they were out of that, too.  I'd hate to hear what else they ran out of, but hey, it was hot and I'm sure they were busy all day long.

I swear the slice of the salmon was the thickness of 10 sheets of paper... not the filet that you would expect from a salmon sandwich. The bread was not toasted and so it was cold and not warm and crispy. I think texture is key when making a sandwich, you get the lettuce, tomato, avocado and salmon (all of which have a moist texture -- except the lettuce) and you want the bread to add a different texture... this is just me, I like my bread warm and crispy.

It was yummy with the bitterness of the daikon sprouts.  \n\nHawaiian Poke:  This was a disappointment as everyone had been raving about it.  Mainly because the poke tasted so gummy.  It did not simply melt in my mouth and the chopped green onions were a bit too overpowering.

Lot of choices (sake salmon, calamari, thai coconut shrimp, tuna tataki etc etc...) if you like your meats and fish but not if you're vegetarian.  Most places in SF by now have a section on their menu for vegetarians. Not here. (Btw, I asked the waiter and she didn't have a suggestion off the menu for me as well)  Frustrated, I asked for peanut butter & jelly sandwich and they didn't have that. So I ended up with some starters and sides: wakame seaweed salad (kindda fishy), pineapple fried rice (kindda bland) and sweet potato fries (ok...the fries were good especially with their special dips).  Not very satisfying for $25 (w/ tips) per person bill.\n\nTip for Pacfic Catch.  Have something vegetarian. Something noodly on your menu. And if you can't do that, at least have peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

"], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "Pacific Catch West Coast Fish House is a solid place to get good if unspectacular seafood dishes like soft tacos, poke and rice bowls and sushi rolls. This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite. But there are other more unique and mom and pop style options out there in the Inner Sunset area that are dying to be supported by the community and newcomers alike.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-07-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Highlights were the peruvian ceviche, thai coconut shrimp, cabo calamari, let's get saucy, and shiso fine.

The coconut flavors are so quintessentially Thai.  I loved the crunch of the crispy coconut flakes and the juicy shrimp.  Frankly, I ended up just eating the coconut flake outer layer instead of the shrimp because it was so good.  The sweet and sour dipping sauce (that you can buy at any Asian market) was a nice complement. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: This roll was actually spicy, which I appreciated.  It was yummy with the bitterness of the daikon sprouts.  \n\nHawaiian Poke:  This was a disappointment as everyone had been raving about it.  Mainly because the poke tasted so gummy.  It did not simply melt in my mouth and the chopped green onions were a bit too overpowering.  I do like my poke to be marinated for a few hours so that the fish really soaks up the flavors but I just felt it had been marinated too long.

I'm not that big on fries, but I must admit that it was pretty delish. \n\n- Hawaiian Poke: My absolute fave of the night. I always have to try poke if a restaurant has it on their menu and this one totally hit the spot. Not as good as homemade, but close enough! Could do without the won ton chips. Would have been great with a seaweed salad. \n\n- Cabo Calamari: This is another dish we usually always try if it's on the menu. We were quite disappointed. Usually when you eat a piece of calamari without the sauce, it should still have some flavor from the breading its coated in, but this was just so...BLAND. Then when we dipped it in the sauce, it completely broke apart. No good. \n\n- Miso Glazed Salmon: Loved the crispy outside and buttery inside. Sauce, mushroom & edamame side, was delicious. The salad on the side was not to my liking. I don't know what it was, but the flavor was horrible and the texture was really tough. \n\n- Korean BBQ Steak: First of all, the waiter hadn't asked my boyfriend how he wanted it cooked. It came out medium rare which was fine though. Tim loved the flavor, but the meat was TOUGH. Don't think it was the way it was cooked, just that that particular cut of meat was tough. He also didn't like the salad. \n\n- Lemongrass Mojito: Pretty good. Bartender made it strong, just the way I like it. \n\nOverall, it was alright.

Excited to chow down, I ran to Gordos and proceeded to stuff my face. However, one thing felt wrong. The fish did not taste the same. Again, here is another place that overloads on the sodium to masque the taste of their food. Not only was the fish too salty, but there was something fishy about the fish. After a while, I decided to cease my \"chow down\" and wrapped the food back into the bag. There is a huge problem if I order food and do not devour the entire thing. This means I either am not hungry or the food does not taste good. Thinking that I must not have been hungry, I decided to eat the bowl later that day. From the moment I went to my bfs house to later that afternoon, my stomach was hurting. I assumed it was due to the hangover from B2B, but it did not make sense.

This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite.

Just a suggestion I think they should put more cheese in with the beans since it added more flavor than without the cheese bites. Also parking here is TOUGH! Best parking is either at the park across the street or a couple blocks down on one of the streets. The meters were 30 min max and the parking enforcement marked tires I think so knew if you put in more money and still ticket you.\n\nOverall, I give this place 2 stars for the food we liked and had to give 1 star to Andrea or Audrea (sorry I butchered your name) since she rocks! She gave EXCELLENT customer service, was helpful, very friendly and considerate to give free sodas once she realized the customers had to go with Plan B. THAT is what customer service is all about!

There wasn't anything special about this, except the fact that her side of Sweet Potato Fries were YUMMY!!\n\nI ordered the Ahi Tuna Wasabi Bowl, topped with (of course) ahi tuna, wakame salad, avocado, ginger and cucumber. The sushi rice was flavored with a wasabi sauce, which was somewhat mild, but SO GOOD!!

Considering it was a Friday, there was a 30 min. wait for the tables inside, so we decided to dine outside, which turned out really nice...although it was butt-freezing cold at first. Thank god they had the protective sheet to block off most of the wind. \n\nTried the Ahi Poke Wasabi bowl this time and it was delicious! Although I did like my Ahi Tuna from my last dining here, I would recommend the Ahi Poke over that. My Lemon Grass Mojito was refreshing as well.

The mochi fondue was a little bit different than we envisioned. We thought there will actually be a \"fondue\" instead of just a container of hot fudge that we dip the mochi in. I guess it's a more economical version of fondue... The hot fudge was warm by the time it got to our table, it was a little bit hard to dip.\n\nI am surprised to see so many great reviews on yelp, we must've gotten the b team that day.

The bartender was awesome, great customer service! We were then seated and Rob reserved  2 booths next to each other.

I started with the seaweed salad and clam miso, so good. The table ordered the fried calamari which was liked by everybody. Watch out!  It comes with a spicy creamy dipping sauce which was received well, but it is hot! \n\nThe tacos were a favorite of the group. Each taco has a different fish, mahi mahi, cod and salmon. They come with sweet potato fries, yum! I had the Surf and Turf, for 19.95, amazing!  The surf was shrimp with 2 skewers loaded, about 6 shrimp to a skewer. The meat was seasoned and juicy, very good. The entree also came with fried shoestring onions and pineapple fried rice, you have the option to substitute for plain brown rice.

If you are under 6' tall and on the slender side, you'll be just fine.\n\nThe servers are very friendly and attentive, which is a pleasant departure from many restaurants in San Francisco, where courteous service sometimes seems to have been otherwise forgotten in the shuffle.  Pacific Catch seems to operate the way many serious, highly rated professional restaurant environments do, with a highly trained staff, attention to detail overall, and a menu that reflects modern trends.  For example, this menu offers not only foodie versions of Miso soup, but also a brown rice substitution option for those of us watching our waistlines or simply attempting to eat a more healthy diet.  \n\nI recommend the coconut skewered shrimp and ordering anything that will get you some of their delicious sweet potato fries (healthier than regular fries, at least!)!

Still, the presentation of the bowl, which arrived covered and was quickly de-topped by the server at the table, gives at least some clue as to what your money buys here:  a higher end experience, even if it's at a chain restaurant, even if the menu looks like a mash-up of Sushi-Bar-Meets-Fish'n'Chips-Joint, even if it's a Monday night in the Inner Sunset.  \n\nThere's something to be said for a restaurant that does what it does well.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-02-27"}, {"excerpts": ["My salmon sandwich was yummy ", "and I want to try the rest of the menu, ", "but maybe I'll try a different location."], "author": "Annaliese D.", "review": "Went here with a group for lunch on a Sunday.

I'm not that big on fries, but I must admit that it was pretty delish. \n\n- Hawaiian Poke: My absolute fave of the night. I always have to try poke if a restaurant has it on their menu and this one totally hit the spot. Not as good as homemade, but close enough! Could do without the won ton chips. Would have been great with a seaweed salad. \n\n- Cabo Calamari: This is another dish we usually always try if it's on the menu. We were quite disappointed. Usually when you eat a piece of calamari without the sauce, it should still have some flavor from the breading its coated in, but this was just so...BLAND. Then when we dipped it in the sauce, it completely broke apart. No good. \n\n- Miso Glazed Salmon: Loved the crispy outside and buttery inside. Sauce, mushroom & edamame side, was delicious. The salad on the side was not to my liking. I don't know what it was, but the flavor was horrible and the texture was really tough. \n\n- Korean BBQ Steak: First of all, the waiter hadn't asked my boyfriend how he wanted it cooked. It came out medium rare which was fine though. Tim loved the flavor, but the meat was TOUGH. Don't think it was the way it was cooked, just that that particular cut of meat was tough. He also didn't like the salad. \n\n- Lemongrass Mojito: Pretty good. Bartender made it strong, just the way I like it. \n\nOverall, it was alright.

So we sat at the bar instead so that we didn't have to wait, which turned out great cuz the bartender was very nice and both our cocktails tasted delicious!  We ordered the Firecracker Salmon roll which was very good.  We also ordered the sturgeon fish of the day which came with an avocado sauce, grilled vegetable, and sweet potato fries.  The fries were really good.  The overall portion size for the entree was just right because it still allows room for appetizer if you want.  We are small eaters so it was just right.  Our total bill was about $60 which is not too bad given we had drinks too.  We're definitely going back and will try some of the other menus.  We recommended this place to our friend who liked it too.  The only complain they had was that everything on the menu is fish but that was fine with us.\n\n1/1/2008: This is the 2nd time I've been here and I would still give it a 4 star.  We had reservations at 7pm for 7 people and they seated us late for about 10 mins and they comped all our appetizers, without us complaining or mentioning it at all.  Now that's a restaurant that cares about their customers.  It was a pleasant surprise and treat.  The service was great throughout the meal as well.  \n\nWith 7 people, we tried alot more different dishes.  \n\nAppetizers:\n1) Shrimp ceviche - They were whole shrimp and there were lots of them.  I think they should dice up the shrimp because it was served with tortilla chips and there's no way you can get a whole shrimp on the chip.  But the taste was decent overall, nothing spectacular so I probably won't order it again\n2) Grilled artichokes - Fresh, good, seasoned properly.  Would order it again.\n3) Calamari - very good, came with fried lemon slices too which is an interesting touch.  the sauce was a little spicy.  Would recommend trying this and I would order it again.\n\nRolls\n1) CA roll - good that it was real crab meat, not some doughy fake ones.  There was too much rice which will fill you up quickly.  I prefer less rice.  Probably would not order it again just because I don't think this is not a signature dish.\n\n2) Rock 'n roll - Too much rice, couldn't find/taste the unagi (bbq eel).  Again, it tastes ok, but wouldn't order it again.\n\n3) Firecracker roll - We had this last time, loved it.  This time it was still good.  For some reason, this roll doesn't not have as much rice as the other too, which is good.  Would order it again\n\nEntrees\n1) Mahi mahi fish of the day - came with grilled veggie, sweet potato fries, mahi mahi served with tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish had a cajun spice rub that was a bit pungent.  The sweet potato fries as always was great.  Grilled veggie - can't go wrong with this.  Don't like the spice rub so won't order it again\n\n2) Grilled shrimp teriyaki bowl - Very tasty, great teriyaki sauce.  Liked that it came with veggie and mushroom, chopped and mixed into the rice.   Would order it again\n\n3) Ono fish of the day - very good.  came with fried onion rings that were delicious.  came with pineapple fried rice which everyone loved.  the fish was grilled on banana leaf so it had a great aroma and taste.  would order it gain.\n\n4) Organic chinook fish of the day - it came with grilled artichoke and brown rice and the fish was served with a tomato sauce.  it was fresh and decently good.  i'm not a big grilled salmon fan so that's why i won't order it again. \n\n5) Grilled Korean beef (another daily special) - I don't eat beef so I can't comment, but my husband thought it was decent.  This place is called \"Pacific Catch\" so I'd stick with the fish but if you have a friend that doesn't like seafood, at least there is an option to have meat.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place and would go again.  Good atmosphere for couples or groups.  Great service.  Nice decor and clean.  Lots of cocktails, decent size wine list.\n\n2/14/08: This is visit #3.\n\nCocktail Review:\nSun Burn - average; menu says there's a tropical syrup in it which I think is what gave it a little after taste of some sort.\nSome cocktail with Gin 209, kiwi and cucumber juice - DELICIOUS!  We had to order a 2nd one.  \n\nHouse salad - Good size, very fresh greens, salad dressing was yummy, if you like a Japanese type kinda dressing w/miso; The mushrooms that were in the salad was delicious.  They're cooked in some sauce, not some uncooked mushroom.\n\nCatch of the Day Fish and Chips - The ling cod fish and chips is the freshest fish and chips we ever had.  It's lightly fried, lightly crispy and covered in a thick batter where you eat a lot of batter and not fish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and fresh and was juicy.  The sweet potato fries as usual, are always yummy!!!\n\nSalmon and mahi mahi taco: Both were good and fresh.  The salsa on each one are good.  The salmon one has a spicy kick to it so if you like spicy, try that.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-12-29"}, {"excerpts": ["i had the king salmon special, and it was a little overcooked and basically drowning in this really sweet, thick sauce.

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and the nearest place where there are notably tons of great eclectic spots to eat, was in the inner sunset district along Irving and 9th. Right on the corner of 9th and Lincoln is Pacific Catch, you cannot miss it. Parking can be a little difficult to find especially on weekends, but it was just our luck that we found a spot right in front. They say the law of attraction can make things happen & that's exactly what happened as my hubby and I were claiming a close spot beforehand. And on top of that, the meters said free parking, which is normally in service on Sundays. Made us feel like we won the lottery!!\n\nAnyways, we were seated right away since it was mid-afternoon and not so crowded. The boys had kids meals: fish and chips and fish tacos. The mister and I shared the white tuna Poke, served with fried wontons. Then we both ordered mix & match tacos. I chose mahi mahi, shrimp, and steak. Hubby chose baja (fried cod), mahi mahi, and steak as well. We each ordered them with a side of fries--spicy and sweet potato. Everything was pretty much devoured really quickly, even my boys cleaned up their plates which is really rare. Either they were just hungry or they loved it, turns out to both.The only flip-side to it was that there was some damage done to our wallets. Total cost for a family of four came out to almost $80 including tax.

The menu features mainly California seafood dishes with some Asian fusion touches here and there. This corner venue is large and spacious with very high ceilings, but they keep the place pretty cold. There is also some cozy outdoor seating under some heaters, but keep in mind, it is right next to the bus stop. \n\nThey start you off with some complimentary shelled edamame and pretzel goldfish, which is a cute nod to the seafood menu, but I'd still prefer bread. I also think edamame is more enjoyable with the shell on.\n\n$16.50 Japanese Wasabi rice bowl w/ Hawaiian poke - seaweed salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori, soy-wasabi sauce:\nThe bowl has a decent portion of bite-size chunks of sweet, juicy tuna. The soy-wasabi sauce is mild and not too strong on the wasabi. It is also seasoned with green onions, chives, and sesame seeds. Everything tastes fresh including the pale slivers of creamy avocado and crunchy, crisp seaweed salad. Be sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite, otherwise you're left with a lots of rice at the bottom of the bowl. \n\n$15.50 Ahi Tuna Salad w/ seared ahi, greens & romaine, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, soy-wasabi vinaigrette:\nWhen I want something lighter, I'll go for the salad. The ingredients are pretty much the same, but with lettuce instead of rice. But with a salad, I go for the seared tuna instead of poke, because it creates the illusion of a meatier salad. Again, try to eat a little of everything together, otherwise you're left with a ton of greens, or as my friend calls it, 'rabbit food.'\n\nA lot of people like the sweet potato fries. They're alright, but sweet potato fries are becoming a ubiquitous offering across the board.\n\nHappy hour deals are pretty good if you are in the area in the afternoons. Poke is about $8.\n\n$9 Baja Shrimp Ceviche - lime, serrano chili, avocado, cilantro, tortilla chips:\nThese bite-size shrimp are springy, meaty and seasoned well. The verde sauce is on the runny side and is quite spicy. I could eat this on its own without tortilla chips too, but the thin, crunchy chips make a nice vehicle.\n\n$12.50 Hawaiian Poke with wonton chips - original ahi tuna, sesame-soy marinade, spicy seasonings:\nA small bowl of juicy ahi cubes covered in sesame seeds and micro greens are accompanied with some fried wontons.\n\n$7 Mochi Fondue - vanilla, chocolate, coffee mochi balls & chocolate dipping sauce:\nI've tried this out of curiosity, but if you've ever had store-bought mochi ice cream balls, I'd say skip it. The taste is pretty similar with the addition of a little bowl of chocolate sauce on the side for dipping.\n\nThe tasty rice bowls are still my go-to items to order here.

I got the Serrano along with my bowl, while my boyfriend got the Serrano and Grilled Salmon. You get a choice of getting it with all rice (White or brown) or half rice and half salad. We both chose half,half. \n\nAt first, I was really surprised how expensive the bowls were, being that it was at $16.50, but when it came out, oh my lordy! They are HUGE. Since my boyfriend got two choices, it was $5 more, which is pricey. The bowl came out and it was a mixture of greens, ocean salad, avocado, and your fish choice and our rice on the bottom. I couldn't finish it! My boyfriend barely finished it. \n\nThe fish quality surprised me! It was just like home. The only thing I did not particularly like were the jalape\u00f1os in the poke.

I swear the slice of the salmon was the thickness of 10 sheets of paper... not the filet that you would expect from a salmon sandwich. The bread was not toasted and so it was cold and not warm and crispy. I think texture is key when making a sandwich, you get the lettuce, tomato, avocado and salmon (all of which have a moist texture -- except the lettuce) and you want the bread to add a different texture... this is just me, I like my bread warm and crispy. As for flavor, it had enough flavor and it was actually tasty, just sad that the main attraction in this sandwich was nowhere to be seen.\n\nService was great! The lady came by quite often to make sure our water will filled and to make sure we were ok. Overall, the food was ok and the service was great.

Of the tacos, my favorite was the cabo shrimp as that one was moist and juicy while the other two tacos were a bit on the drier side which makes sense given that it was fish.

This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite.

That was tasty but a bit messy (it's nice they have napkins and wet naps to clean off your hands).  We then ordered the Sunset Sushi Roll (which comes in 8 pieces) and Poke Fest Trio (we tried the original, California, and the Macadamia Nut).  I personally liked the Macadamia Nut and Original Poke. I think the California Poke was too citrusy (is that a word).  \n\nI definitely want to try their happy hour (see what deals I can get). They have happy hour both from 4-6 M-F and 10-close! Great for those late night eats. Also, I have to try their rice bowl. From what I saw, they are HUGE! \n\nOur server (forgot her name) was real nice and pretty attentive. I don't think it was too busy but even if, good service always makes the meal (and review) even better  \n\nThey technically have a parking lot in the rear but it's usually full but at least it's an option in the busy inner sunset. \n\nDefinitely a place to come again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-05-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Hawaiian influenced; excellent tasting tuna poke, ahi salad and fish tacos ... very crowded on a Friday nite at the sunset district location [better make reservations] - great service n friendly ... definitely will be back when in SF again ..."], "author": "Jerry G.", "review": "One of the better places ive eaten in SF this past week ... something a little different, but not too different!

Instead of serving you bread, they give you a small plate of fish pretzels and edamame beans.  \n\nThey have a large variety of dishes to try.  I like their wasabi bowls.  It comes with seaweed, fish (depending on what kind, I get the Ahi Tuna or Poke Tuna), guacamole, and some other ingredients I don't remember.  The bowl itself is pretty big, and will definitely fill you up!  It costs about $15 for this bowl.  Their sweet potato fries are also very delicious, served with sweet and sour sauce.  Their sushi rolls are average, and nothing spectacular...\n\nI tried their soup special one day... I forget the actual name of it, but it was similar to a ciopinno.  It was a tomato based soup with seafood.  The broth was very flavorful!  There was plenty of content in the soup too.  I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it!!  The soup cost about $12 though.  But very delicious.  It's something not always on their menu.\n\nTheir fish and chips were very good, comes with about 3-4 pieces depending on what combo you get...  The fish was fresh.  I also got a fish special of the day.  The fish was cooked nicely, and not overcooked.  I don't remember what was in it, but it was reallygood over all.\n\nOverall, if you go here, get their fish dishes.

Now, ask anyone close to me, and they will affirm that my palette is adamantly of the anti-salad mode, but Pacific Catch's hawaiian poke salad has converted me.  The salads are HUGE, comprised of a generous helping of rare hawaiian poke atop a bed of mixed greens garnished generously with slices of avocado, a handful of baby tomatoes, a healthy sprig of daikon sprouts, shredded carrots in a joyous, unassuming soy-wasabi vinaigrette.\n\nIf you're doubtful that the salad won't quench your appetite, order a side order of their sweet potato fries to push you just over the edge.  These crispy, subtly sweet fries score big on their own, but what knocks them out of the ballpark for me is the sweet chili dipping sauce.  For those who enjoy variety (as my hubby and I do!), they also have a wasabi-aioli dipping sauce too.\n\nJust when we thought Pacific Catch couldn't impress us anymore, today we tried their fried dulce de leche 'spring rolls' for a sweet finish to our already yummy meal.

"], "author": "Julia T.", "review": "Out of the three Pacific Catch locations, I would say this is my overall favorite. Chestnut St. is just way too tiny and crowded, though that might result in the food tasting better because you had to fight so hard to park/get a table. Corte Madera's location is too embedded in the outdoor mall scene and has way too many kiddies running around. But this 9th Ave. location is pretty much perfect with plenty of seating for the bar and regular dining area. It also has its own parking lot so you don't have to compete for the street meters. \n\nFood is pretty consistent at all locations. You can count on the fact that mostly everything you order from the regular menu will be very good. Some of my favorites are the wasabi bowls (with brown or sushi rice) and any of the fried seafood baskets. I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. SO GOOD. Everything comes freshly fried with those awesome sweet potato fries. But eat everything while they are fresh! I don't recommend taking leftover fries home. They really those their flavor after they've cooled down. \n\nThough their sushi roll selection lacks raw fish, I think they are still made very well with the mostly cooked ingredients. One of my favorites and one that DOES have raw fish is the Rising Sun roll. It has tempura shrimp and avocado wrapped in ahi tuna with a citrus sauce. I don't like that they stuff pickled ginger into the roll but if you're like me, just request that they leave it out. Otherwise it's a very tasty roll. The ahi tuna is always fresh and flavorful.  I love that they give you big pieces of it too. (We got that roll totally F-R-E-E! with the coupon in the Green Zebra book!) I could dine happily on their sushi rolls alone. \n\nJust recently I ventured off from my regulars and tried one of the their specials: Trout bbq'd baja style so it was spice rubbed and grilled, served with tomatilla avocado sauce, some thin slices of veggies, and fresh grilled corn over sweet potato fries. I could tell the fish was very fresh but for me, it was TOO seasoned and got a little salty since the fish wasn't very thick. And though I had originally wanted the fries, I would now have preferred and wished that the fish was served over rice. I think I'll stick to my regulars next time. \n\nBig pluses:\n-I've talked to the workers and seen for myself that Pacific Catch is environmentally conscious. They use biodegradable materials, from the takeout containers to the straw in your drink. Pacific Catch also practices composting from their kitchen to the leftover food scraps. Smiles all around. =D\n-I don't know anywhere else that you can get UNLIMITED refills on Thai iced tea. I could drink three glasses easy.

Parking was a nightmare there.  Make sure you come early to allow yourself to look for parking.\n\nAll the staffs were friendly there.  Our server was very nice and friendly but was lacking service toward the end of the meal,  I guess he was too busy with the other big party (15 people).  He was pretty slow and did not refill our water.\n\nThe menu was extensive.  There were a lot of varieties that you could choose from.  You can choose from Salad, Rice Bowls, Tacos, Sandwiches, etc...\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nPacific Ceviche Trio ($17) - a sampling of shrimp ceviche, Hawaiian poke & Peruvian ceviche with chips.  It was great.  The portion was good for share.  I really like the purple potato chips.  It was perfect to eat with the poke.  Poke was so fresh and flavorful.  \n\nSweet Potato Fries ($6) - Portion was big.  The fries was so good.  Thick, crispy outside and soft inside.  It came with ginger wasabi aioli and sweet Thai chili sauces.  I think the wasabi aioli was better with the fries.  \n\nSpicy Tuna Sushi Roll ($8.50) - The sushi roll was huge.  very filling......everything was so fresh.\n\nCalifornia Roll ($9.00) - Again, the roll was big.  The crab meat was real crab salad.  Tasty.......\n\nI got the Hawaiian Poke Rice Bowl ($15).  It had tuna, wakame salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, cucumber, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori and soy-wasabi sauce.  I agree with other Yelpers.  The portion was huge and had a lot of rice but not much fish.  $15 was a little bit over price.  But the taste was pretty good.   The fish was fresh and flavorful.  I got half brown rice and half salad.  All ingredients were very fresh and tasty.  The only thing is the soy-wasabi sauce was little bit too much.  Kinda of salty to me.\n\nMy sister got the Ahi Rice Bowl ($15).  The ingredients were the same as the other rice bowls except the fish.  Ahi was very fresh.  I did not read the menu carefully.  If I knew the Ceviche Trio had poke, I would order Ahi rice bowl instead.\n\nI really wanted to try their mochi for the dessert but I was too full.....Ok, next time!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-08-22"}, {"excerpts": ["My partner and I shared the spicy tuna rolls which were amazing.

We sat at one of the tables with the tall bar stools, which was quite uncomfortable as the bottom of the table was not hollow for our legs to fit into.  My knees kept hitting the sides of the table. \n\nNow for the food.  I was tempted to order everything on their Bar Bites menu but opted to have just the first 5 items (minus the edamame beans and sweet potato fries) and 2 refreshing cosmos - YUM YUM.  I have been here before but for some reason the food was not as good as I remembered.  I had the following in the order of favorite to least favorite:\n\nAsparagus & Shiitake Roll: It was an interesting vegetarian take on a sushi roll and I found the asparagus tempura and the tiny strings of mushroom and carrot to be quite lovely.\n\nThai Coconut Shrimp: It's funny because when I had my first bite, I was like \"OMG...it feels like a Thai restaurant in my mouth.\"  Now looking at the menu as I write this entry, the dish's name is quite befitting. The coconut flavors are so quintessentially Thai.  I loved the crunch of the crispy coconut flakes and the juicy shrimp.  Frankly, I ended up just eating the coconut flake outer layer instead of the shrimp because it was so good.  The sweet and sour dipping sauce (that you can buy at any Asian market) was a nice complement. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: This roll was actually spicy, which I appreciated.  It was yummy with the bitterness of the daikon sprouts.  \n\nHawaiian Poke:  This was a disappointment as everyone had been raving about it.  Mainly because the poke tasted so gummy.  It did not simply melt in my mouth and the chopped green onions were a bit too overpowering.  I do like my poke to be marinated for a few hours so that the fish really soaks up the flavors but I just felt it had been marinated too long.  And the crispy chips started to give me a headache...which I get when I eat too much fried food.  Disappointing.\n\nSpicy Cabo Calamari:  Pretty good but nothing too spectacular.  It was interesting that they also deep-fried slices of lemon and peppers.  The peppers were really yummy and SPICY...hehe...I attempted to eat the lemons too, but I suggest you not do that.      \n\nThe food is pretty good and very well priced. They also played good music...love Bob Marley. :) I think I hyped myself up for this dining experience as I hadn't been here in a long time.  I probably won't go for a few months.

Chestnut St. is just way too tiny and crowded, though that might result in the food tasting better because you had to fight so hard to park/get a table. Corte Madera's location is too embedded in the outdoor mall scene and has way too many kiddies running around. But this 9th Ave. location is pretty much perfect with plenty of seating for the bar and regular dining area. It also has its own parking lot so you don't have to compete for the street meters. \n\nFood is pretty consistent at all locations. You can count on the fact that mostly everything you order from the regular menu will be very good. Some of my favorites are the wasabi bowls (with brown or sushi rice) and any of the fried seafood baskets. I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. SO GOOD. Everything comes freshly fried with those awesome sweet potato fries. But eat everything while they are fresh! I don't recommend taking leftover fries home. They really those their flavor after they've cooled down. \n\nThough their sushi roll selection lacks raw fish, I think they are still made very well with the mostly cooked ingredients. One of my favorites and one that DOES have raw fish is the Rising Sun roll. It has tempura shrimp and avocado wrapped in ahi tuna with a citrus sauce. I don't like that they stuff pickled ginger into the roll but if you're like me, just request that they leave it out. Otherwise it's a very tasty roll. The ahi tuna is always fresh and flavorful.

I could tell the fish was very fresh but for me, it was TOO seasoned and got a little salty since the fish wasn't very thick. And though I had originally wanted the fries, I would now have preferred and wished that the fish was served over rice. I think I'll stick to my regulars next time. \n\nBig pluses:\n-I've talked to the workers and seen for myself that Pacific Catch is environmentally conscious.

So we sat at the bar instead so that we didn't have to wait, which turned out great cuz the bartender was very nice and both our cocktails tasted delicious!  We ordered the Firecracker Salmon roll which was very good.  We also ordered the sturgeon fish of the day which came with an avocado sauce, grilled vegetable, and sweet potato fries.  The fries were really good.  The overall portion size for the entree was just right because it still allows room for appetizer if you want.  We are small eaters so it was just right.  Our total bill was about $60 which is not too bad given we had drinks too.  We're definitely going back and will try some of the other menus.  We recommended this place to our friend who liked it too.  The only complain they had was that everything on the menu is fish but that was fine with us.\n\n1/1/2008: This is the 2nd time I've been here and I would still give it a 4 star.  We had reservations at 7pm for 7 people and they seated us late for about 10 mins and they comped all our appetizers, without us complaining or mentioning it at all.  Now that's a restaurant that cares about their customers.  It was a pleasant surprise and treat.  The service was great throughout the meal as well.  \n\nWith 7 people, we tried alot more different dishes.  \n\nAppetizers:\n1) Shrimp ceviche - They were whole shrimp and there were lots of them.  I think they should dice up the shrimp because it was served with tortilla chips and there's no way you can get a whole shrimp on the chip.  But the taste was decent overall, nothing spectacular so I probably won't order it again\n2) Grilled artichokes - Fresh, good, seasoned properly.  Would order it again.\n3) Calamari - very good, came with fried lemon slices too which is an interesting touch.  the sauce was a little spicy.  Would recommend trying this and I would order it again.\n\nRolls\n1) CA roll - good that it was real crab meat, not some doughy fake ones.  There was too much rice which will fill you up quickly.  I prefer less rice.  Probably would not order it again just because I don't think this is not a signature dish.\n\n2) Rock 'n roll - Too much rice, couldn't find/taste the unagi (bbq eel).  Again, it tastes ok, but wouldn't order it again.\n\n3) Firecracker roll - We had this last time, loved it.  This time it was still good.  For some reason, this roll doesn't not have as much rice as the other too, which is good.  Would order it again\n\nEntrees\n1) Mahi mahi fish of the day - came with grilled veggie, sweet potato fries, mahi mahi served with tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish had a cajun spice rub that was a bit pungent.  The sweet potato fries as always was great.  Grilled veggie - can't go wrong with this.  Don't like the spice rub so won't order it again\n\n2) Grilled shrimp teriyaki bowl - Very tasty, great teriyaki sauce.  Liked that it came with veggie and mushroom, chopped and mixed into the rice.   Would order it again\n\n3) Ono fish of the day - very good.  came with fried onion rings that were delicious.  came with pineapple fried rice which everyone loved.  the fish was grilled on banana leaf so it had a great aroma and taste.  would order it gain.\n\n4) Organic chinook fish of the day - it came with grilled artichoke and brown rice and the fish was served with a tomato sauce.  it was fresh and decently good.  i'm not a big grilled salmon fan so that's why i won't order it again. \n\n5) Grilled Korean beef (another daily special) - I don't eat beef so I can't comment, but my husband thought it was decent.  This place is called \"Pacific Catch\" so I'd stick with the fish but if you have a friend that doesn't like seafood, at least there is an option to have meat.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place and would go again.  Good atmosphere for couples or groups.  Great service.  Nice decor and clean.  Lots of cocktails, decent size wine list.\n\n2/14/08: This is visit #3.\n\nCocktail Review:\nSun Burn - average; menu says there's a tropical syrup in it which I think is what gave it a little after taste of some sort.\nSome cocktail with Gin 209, kiwi and cucumber juice - DELICIOUS!  We had to order a 2nd one.  \n\nHouse salad - Good size, very fresh greens, salad dressing was yummy, if you like a Japanese type kinda dressing w/miso; The mushrooms that were in the salad was delicious.  They're cooked in some sauce, not some uncooked mushroom.\n\nCatch of the Day Fish and Chips - The ling cod fish and chips is the freshest fish and chips we ever had.  It's lightly fried, lightly crispy and covered in a thick batter where you eat a lot of batter and not fish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and fresh and was juicy.  The sweet potato fries as usual, are always yummy!!!\n\nSalmon and mahi mahi taco: Both were good and fresh.  The salsa on each one are good.

"], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "Pacific Catch West Coast Fish House is a solid place to get good if unspectacular seafood dishes like soft tacos, poke and rice bowls and sushi rolls. This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite. But there are other more unique and mom and pop style options out there in the Inner Sunset area that are dying to be supported by the community and newcomers alike.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-07-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Ahi Tuna Salad w/ seared ahi, greens & romaine, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, soy-wasabi vinaigrette:\n", "When I want something lighter, I'll go for the salad.

They weren't horrible, but comparing my dish to everyone else, it felt like I was a kid who got chicken fingers and fries at a wedding whereas everybody else got the prime rib. Speaking of fries, SWEET POTATO FRIES, yummay!! The Cajun fries weren't bad too, but I love sweet potato fries and these would be rated 9 on my scale of 10 (10 being absolute perfection).\n\nFor a casual encounter, I would definitely recommend fish tacos which comes with the choice of fries (choose sweet potato). But everyone at the table (or at least 90% of the people) ordered the Wasabi bowl. Next time I'm back, I will definitely get that. Not only does it look delish, it's also quite healthy as well. From what I noticed with other people, they had a choice of white or brown rice, half salad and half Ahi tuna. Oh my gosh my mouth is watering and my stomach just grumbled a bit while I thought about that.\n\nNext time...

Chestnut St. is just way too tiny and crowded, though that might result in the food tasting better because you had to fight so hard to park/get a table. Corte Madera's location is too embedded in the outdoor mall scene and has way too many kiddies running around. But this 9th Ave. location is pretty much perfect with plenty of seating for the bar and regular dining area. It also has its own parking lot so you don't have to compete for the street meters. \n\nFood is pretty consistent at all locations. You can count on the fact that mostly everything you order from the regular menu will be very good. Some of my favorites are the wasabi bowls (with brown or sushi rice) and any of the fried seafood baskets. I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. SO GOOD. Everything comes freshly fried with those awesome sweet potato fries. But eat everything while they are fresh! I don't recommend taking leftover fries home. They really those their flavor after they've cooled down. \n\nThough their sushi roll selection lacks raw fish, I think they are still made very well with the mostly cooked ingredients. One of my favorites and one that DOES have raw fish is the Rising Sun roll. It has tempura shrimp and avocado wrapped in ahi tuna with a citrus sauce. I don't like that they stuff pickled ginger into the roll but if you're like me, just request that they leave it out. Otherwise it's a very tasty roll. The ahi tuna is always fresh and flavorful.  I love that they give you big pieces of it too. (We got that roll totally F-R-E-E! with the coupon in the Green Zebra book!) I could dine happily on their sushi rolls alone. \n\nJust recently I ventured off from my regulars and tried one of the their specials: Trout bbq'd baja style so it was spice rubbed and grilled, served with tomatilla avocado sauce, some thin slices of veggies, and fresh grilled corn over sweet potato fries. I could tell the fish was very fresh but for me, it was TOO seasoned and got a little salty since the fish wasn't very thick. And though I had originally wanted the fries, I would now have preferred and wished that the fish was served over rice. I think I'll stick to my regulars next time. \n\nBig pluses:\n-I've talked to the workers and seen for myself that Pacific Catch is environmentally conscious. They use biodegradable materials, from the takeout containers to the straw in your drink. Pacific Catch also practices composting from their kitchen to the leftover food scraps. Smiles all around. =D\n-I don't know anywhere else that you can get UNLIMITED refills on Thai iced tea. I could drink three glasses easy.

I don't know if it was because the name gave me the assumption they were a California Cusine restaurant with a slant of seafood offering, or the extensive menu that included American entrees, alongside Japanese items like sushi, teriyaki, and Mexican with the tacos. The edamame they served as soon as we were seated tells me they are Japanese. Maybe it was the Hawaiin entrees, or the fact that the visible cook staff was completely Hispanic, except for the one white guy calling out orders at the pass. Mexliforniapanese Dining. Nah, doesn't have the right ring to it. \n\nWe were disappointed in the ahi tuna poke appetizer. The ahi was fresh enough, but the seasoning was monotone, and overdone.

Good, but nothing worth writing about. I should stop here.\n\nThe coleslaw that accompanied our entrees were suprisingly good. It was a light cream dressing with a distinct Korean-type pickling tang I detected. It was light and palette refreshing.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience.

The fries were really good.  The overall portion size for the entree was just right because it still allows room for appetizer if you want.  We are small eaters so it was just right.  Our total bill was about $60 which is not too bad given we had drinks too.  We're definitely going back and will try some of the other menus.  We recommended this place to our friend who liked it too.  The only complain they had was that everything on the menu is fish but that was fine with us.\n\n1/1/2008: This is the 2nd time I've been here and I would still give it a 4 star.  We had reservations at 7pm for 7 people and they seated us late for about 10 mins and they comped all our appetizers, without us complaining or mentioning it at all.  Now that's a restaurant that cares about their customers.  It was a pleasant surprise and treat.  The service was great throughout the meal as well.  \n\nWith 7 people, we tried alot more different dishes.  \n\nAppetizers:\n1) Shrimp ceviche - They were whole shrimp and there were lots of them.  I think they should dice up the shrimp because it was served with tortilla chips and there's no way you can get a whole shrimp on the chip.  But the taste was decent overall, nothing spectacular so I probably won't order it again\n2) Grilled artichokes - Fresh, good, seasoned properly.  Would order it again.\n3) Calamari - very good, came with fried lemon slices too which is an interesting touch.  the sauce was a little spicy.  Would recommend trying this and I would order it again.\n\nRolls\n1) CA roll - good that it was real crab meat, not some doughy fake ones.  There was too much rice which will fill you up quickly.  I prefer less rice.  Probably would not order it again just because I don't think this is not a signature dish.\n\n2) Rock 'n roll - Too much rice, couldn't find/taste the unagi (bbq eel).  Again, it tastes ok, but wouldn't order it again.\n\n3) Firecracker roll - We had this last time, loved it.  This time it was still good.  For some reason, this roll doesn't not have as much rice as the other too, which is good.  Would order it again\n\nEntrees\n1) Mahi mahi fish of the day - came with grilled veggie, sweet potato fries, mahi mahi served with tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish had a cajun spice rub that was a bit pungent.  The sweet potato fries as always was great.  Grilled veggie - can't go wrong with this.  Don't like the spice rub so won't order it again\n\n2) Grilled shrimp teriyaki bowl - Very tasty, great teriyaki sauce.  Liked that it came with veggie and mushroom, chopped and mixed into the rice.   Would order it again\n\n3) Ono fish of the day - very good.  came with fried onion rings that were delicious.  came with pineapple fried rice which everyone loved.  the fish was grilled on banana leaf so it had a great aroma and taste.  would order it gain.\n\n4) Organic chinook fish of the day - it came with grilled artichoke and brown rice and the fish was served with a tomato sauce.  it was fresh and decently good.  i'm not a big grilled salmon fan so that's why i won't order it again. \n\n5) Grilled Korean beef (another daily special) - I don't eat beef so I can't comment, but my husband thought it was decent.  This place is called \"Pacific Catch\" so I'd stick with the fish but if you have a friend that doesn't like seafood, at least there is an option to have meat.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place and would go again.  Good atmosphere for couples or groups.  Great service.  Nice decor and clean.  Lots of cocktails, decent size wine list.\n\n2/14/08: This is visit #3.\n\nCocktail Review:\nSun Burn - average; menu says there's a tropical syrup in it which I think is what gave it a little after taste of some sort.\nSome cocktail with Gin 209, kiwi and cucumber juice - DELICIOUS!  We had to order a 2nd one.  \n\nHouse salad - Good size, very fresh greens, salad dressing was yummy, if you like a Japanese type kinda dressing w/miso; The mushrooms that were in the salad was delicious.  They're cooked in some sauce, not some uncooked mushroom.\n\nCatch of the Day Fish and Chips - The ling cod fish and chips is the freshest fish and chips we ever had.  It's lightly fried, lightly crispy and covered in a thick batter where you eat a lot of batter and not fish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and fresh and was juicy.  The sweet potato fries as usual, are always yummy!!!\n\nSalmon and mahi mahi taco: Both were good and fresh.  The salsa on each one are good.  The salmon one has a spicy kick to it so if you like spicy, try that.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-12-29"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered a variety of stuff with the kids mostly getting various fish tacos, adults ranging from the grilled salmon to beef salad.

For $15, I wish I ordered the Hawaiian bowl cause I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be tasting anything.  With a decent amount of crab that they give you, and an overdose of avocado, surprisingly, and the soy-wasabi sauce, it had HARDLY any taste.  I was confused.

Whether it's because they've been around for so long or because I've b een here so many times, it's gotten to the point now where they just kind of fade into the background for me.  Which might explain why, despite all of those trips here, I've still never written a review for these guys!  Although, I could've sworn I wrote something about them at some point over the years...\n\nWhile the place is starting to show a bit of its age (though they did convert part of their entry way into an outdoor seating area with a fire pit), Pacific Catch hasn't let its menu get outdated.  Along with expanding the choices for their long time staples (rice bowls, fried seafood, fish-centric entrees, sushi rolls, etc.), they also keep a rotation of daily chalkboard specials and added a \"raw bar\" menu, which features varieties of ceviche, poke, taktaki, platters/towers, and more.\n\nGiven how many times I've been here, I've been able to try a number of things on their menu, so I'd like to think I have a pretty good sense of them overall.

However, whether it's been when I've dined in or when I used to get takeout, I usually end up getting the same thing every time - their JAPANESE WASABI BOWL with Poke ($16.50).\n\nFilled with Seaweed Salad, Avocado, Daikon Salad, Ginger, Sesame Seeds, Shredded Nori, and Soy-Wasabi Sauce, this isn't bad, but lacking compared to what you can get from poke joints.  While their poke (tuna) is generally pretty fresh, everything else is hit or miss.  The seaweed salad and avocado are good, but I'm not a fan of their daikon salad and the sauce is just okay (I personally prefer ponzu-based ones).  What's more, the rice can be a little inconsistent (can be overcooked).\n\nDespite how their food may not strike me like how it used to, I certainly appreciate how steady and consistent Pacific Catch has been.  From my first trip here, to the time we sat at their bar and watched the Giants clinch the 2014 World Series, to this most recent trip, the food hasn't changed much, for better or worse.

To eat on the epic journey to CAS, and to eat on the way back, and to eat for breakfast, and oh for heaven's sake...why don't I have a personal chef?\n\nEDIT - 03/30/09 --\nI took my dad, uncle, and assorted other people here on a Saturday night.  They were pretty good about serving a party of 8, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food.\n\nTwo things I wanted to update about: \n1. The spicy pacific martini.  Holy CRAP, that is good.  Mango puree, vodka, and serrano chili - the perfect fruit drink, with a spicy kick.  Goes so well with seafood, and worth the $8 (I don't say that lightly, either).\n\n2. Food mixup.  When I pointed out to the server that my mixed catch basket lacked crispy oysters (ack!) she was going to bring me a side of them, but ended up bringing me another entire entree!  I was really pleased, and it never hurts to bring home leftovers.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. ", "SO GOOD. "], "author": "Julia T.", "review": "Out of the three Pacific Catch locations, I would say this is my overall favorite. Chestnut St. is just way too tiny and crowded, though that might result in the food tasting better because you had to fight so hard to park/get a table. Corte Madera's location is too embedded in the outdoor mall scene and has way too many kiddies running around. But this 9th Ave. location is pretty much perfect with plenty of seating for the bar and regular dining area. It also has its own parking lot so you don't have to compete for the street meters. \n\nFood is pretty consistent at all locations. You can count on the fact that mostly everything you order from the regular menu will be very good. Some of my favorites are the wasabi bowls (with brown or sushi rice) and any of the fried seafood baskets. I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. SO GOOD. Everything comes freshly fried with those awesome sweet potato fries. But eat everything while they are fresh! I don't recommend taking leftover fries home. They really those their flavor after they've cooled down. \n\nThough their sushi roll selection lacks raw fish, I think they are still made very well with the mostly cooked ingredients. One of my favorites and one that DOES have raw fish is the Rising Sun roll. It has tempura shrimp and avocado wrapped in ahi tuna with a citrus sauce. I don't like that they stuff pickled ginger into the roll but if you're like me, just request that they leave it out. Otherwise it's a very tasty roll. The ahi tuna is always fresh and flavorful.  I love that they give you big pieces of it too. (We got that roll totally F-R-E-E! with the coupon in the Green Zebra book!) I could dine happily on their sushi rolls alone. \n\nJust recently I ventured off from my regulars and tried one of the their specials: Trout bbq'd baja style so it was spice rubbed and grilled, served with tomatilla avocado sauce, some thin slices of veggies, and fresh grilled corn over sweet potato fries. I could tell the fish was very fresh but for me, it was TOO seasoned and got a little salty since the fish wasn't very thick. And though I had originally wanted the fries, I would now have preferred and wished that the fish was served over rice. I think I'll stick to my regulars next time. \n\nBig pluses:\n-I've talked to the workers and seen for myself that Pacific Catch is environmentally conscious. They use biodegradable materials, from the takeout containers to the straw in your drink. Pacific Catch also practices composting from their kitchen to the leftover food scraps. Smiles all around. =D\n-I don't know anywhere else that you can get UNLIMITED refills on Thai iced tea. I could drink three glasses easy.

There are booths and tables; indoor and outdoor seating.  Wine bottle light fixtures here are a cool touch.  There's an open kitchen and a bar you can hang out at if you don't want to sit down and eat.\n\nFood:  I ordered the California Salmon sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries.  The sandwich was really good.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, cooked all the way through, but it was still tender.  The bread was surprisingly good.  It was a Ciabatta, but the outside was crisp and the inside was soft and warm.  It also came with avocado, and a citrus aoli.  I have to talk about the avocado because the avocado here is extremely good.  Usually, the avocado I get at restaurants are not ripe and bland, but at PC it was soft and very flavorful.  The aoli was good too.  Not sure how it's supposed to taste like, but I liked it.  The sweet potato fries were decent, this last time I had them.  When I had them this time, they were a little soggy and cold.  \nI was disappointed because I had them once before and they were on point.\n\nService: Here's where PC loses some stars. Minus one star for being slow.  The waitress actually took our orders and brought our food out very quickly, but after that the service fell off.  Took awhile to get a refill on my drink, and to get the check after the meal was over.\n\nThis might be mean, but minus one star for the hostess.  Don't get me wrong, the hostess was nice and all, but she was wearing this black mini-skirt, showing off way too much skin (she wasn't the attractive).  The whole time I was thinking, you're a hostess at a restaurant, not a vegas night club.

Yeah, we were still full from lunch, but we took my folk's offer and headed out. Problem was that it was 7PM on a Saturday night, we had no reservations, and most places were pretty crowded already. We struck out on a couple of places either because parking sucked (No Nopa this time), business closed (bye PJ's), or I was wearing the wrong clothes (I had a sweater, and Naan and Curry was steaming inside, unless I wanted a permanent tandoori smell).\n\nWe walked into Pacific Catch, and got a table in the bar area. Pretty lively inside the bar area, with the Cal vs. UCLA hoops game going on (too bad Cal). A lot of people in the bar section were dining in, so the waitresses were doing double duty serving drinks and serving food. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n-House Cured Sake Salmon. This came with 2 crispy nori rice cakes, wasabi creme fraiche, onions, and black tobiko caviar. Salmon had a mildly cured taste, the wasabi creme fraiche had a little, but not overpowering kick.

They are beyond flavorful and help you forget that you're eating at a chain restaurant. I also like the quaint Honolulu Tribune newspaper wax/butcher paper that the fish tacos come on because it feels like how a mom-and-pop fish stand would serve 'em. I like to get the three taco platter ($17.50 with the sweet potato fries) with traditional baja and cabo shrimp. With the cod and avocado-tomatillo salsa, the traditional baja is my personal favorite because it seems juicier and fresher, but I'm also a sucker for the cabo shrimp because of the generous amount of avocado it comes with. $17.50 certainly seems like a lot to pay for three fish tacos, but I've never been disappointed with the quality of the fish or found myself hungry again a few hours later.\n\nSpeaking of prices, the Mai Tai here sure is tasty and will fulfill all your rum-related dreams, but at $11, I have a hard time justifying it because it's not exactly of cocktail bar caliber. So get a pitcher of it instead -- $40 for five servings!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. "], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "Pacific Catch West Coast Fish House is a solid place to get good if unspectacular seafood dishes like soft tacos, poke and rice bowls and sushi rolls. This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite. But there are other more unique and mom and pop style options out there in the Inner Sunset area that are dying to be supported by the community and newcomers alike.", "rating": 3, "date": "2016-07-27"}, {"excerpts": ["We both had the two taco platters - traditional Baja and grilled steak.

There is a full bar on the outside looking out onto Irving street. The lighting is dim and warm (very complementing to your skin :) ). As well as their paintings on the walls, very welcoming.

After we were seated, we had a waiter named Neal, tall, middle-aged, white male with glasses and long-ish white hair, He was really impatient and rude. He did not give us that much time to review the menu before he kept bugging about ordering. By the second or third time of him asking, we were actually ready and he left in the middle of us telling him we were ready to order in irritation. He also made four mistakes on the bill (we had split checks) and was very sarcastic when we had to add more money (because he did not divide the cards right), and I quote, \" Wow how generous of you all, now I am blushing because you added more money\", it might not sound as bad as he said it, but it came off very rude and sarcastic. After the fourth mistake we asked for the manager to set the cards right because clearly he didn't know what he was doing. And even the manager cut my friend off in the middle of expressing our frustration with the cards and also Neal's service to us. Then, once the manager spoke to Neal he came back to us saying \" SO whats the problem now!?!\" then walking away AGAIN in the middle of our sentence shaking his head. I have NO IDEA why they were so out of it with their service but it was EXTREMELY disappointing because the FOOD WAS REALLY GOOD.

We were early for happy hour by a 1/2 hour, but I was starving so we ordered anyways. 3 mahi mahi tacos ($16)  and a sushi roll ($13), I already forgot the name of. \n\nThe sushi roll was good, and huge. The shrimp was a nice, actually huge tempera'd shrimp (though the crunch was lost) and not those tiny ones I normally see. Lots of avocado and julienned cucumber with a sliver of ginger, topped with a nice slice of ahi tuna. I like ginger and really liked this roll, although, just wish the shrimp had retained a bit of crunch. \n\nI didn't try the fish tacos, but Cory seemed happy. Big pieces of fish in here and he ate them all. The fries were, fries, a little too mushy for my preference. Cory had a few beers and I had water as we sat on the patio area with a view of the corner so prime people watching area. We were told by another frequent customer they had recently renovated everything, including enclosing the patio area. More glass would be nice, but you would lose seating I guess.

We weren't sure what to expect because it was new, but the online menu sure looked great.\n\nThe decor is modern and clean, providing a rather trendy atmosphere.  The place wasn't crowded when we came so we didn't have to wait for a table, which is always nice.  We saw one table had ordered the Baja Shrimp Ceviche so we decided to start with that.   The presentation was really cool.  The ceviche, stuffed full of shrimp and avocado, was served in a tall martini glass with a pile of tortilla chips sprawled around the base.  The best thing about this dish was how much shrimp they gave us!  It's always annoying when you pay a premium for a shrimp entre and get 3 shrimp.  We counted each shrimp as we were going through the ceviche, they were good sized shrimp mind you, and ended up with almost 20! The chef was overly generous with the shrimp for the price we payed.\n\nFor my entre, I went with 3 tacos; 1 BBQ salmon with corn salsa and lime crema, 1 tropical grilled shrimp with mango salsa, and 1 spice-rubbed grilled mahi mahi with avocado tomatilla salsa.  Now let me first say that I am a little biased when it comes to fish tacos.  I've been a long time advocate for Wahoo's fish tacos and nothing has ever compared to their tacos.  Pacific catch however served me some really tasty fish tacos, which can definitely compete with Wahoo's.  I really appreciated the nice quality of salsas and toppings that went into the tacos.  They worked well and tasted great with the various fish and shrimp pairings.  I took down these bad boys so fast and had to restrain myself from ordering more!\n\nWe also ordered sweet potato fries which were good.  I tend to find any type of french fry that offers a spin off the traditional French fry (different potatoes, etc) very satisfying.\n\nPacific Catch is definitely a decent restaurant and we will for sure go there again.  They had other dishes, such as sushi and fancy deserts that I would also like to try.  I also noticed they had a pretty nice full bar with comfy seats and a decent happy hour.  This would be a good place to come have some drinks and a nice dinner with some friends or even a date.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["The fish tacos are always delicious; especially the Mahi Mahi Fish Taco which is one of my favorites. \n\n"], "author": "Jen Y.", "review": "I was excited to try the Pacific Catch on 9th because I've heard great things about the space and it's kind of a hassle to go all the way to Chestnut. The look of the restaurant is beautifully casual and comfortable with plenty of seating. For that, I give this restaurant big ups. \n\nOur waitress on the other hand was just blah. It looked like she cared more about socializing and dancing with her co-worker friends more than earning her tip from us. The whole time she seemed insincere from the moment she brought us our drinks to handing us the check. \n\nI always liked Pacific Catch's food, even though it's slightly over-priced.  The food is the same in terms of taste and the sweet potato fries (which I love w/ the wasabi aeoli) were consistantly yummy. Even though we ordered the Firecracker Salmon Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll, I don't recommend trying the sushi here. It lacks flavor, authenticity, and freshness..but I didn't expect it to be good so I wasn't surprised. The fish tacos are always delicious; especially the Mahi Mahi Fish Taco which is one of my favorites. \n\nThe atmosphere, location, and food is great. However, the waitress we had and the sushi are not. Something else was just lacking as a whole but I can't put my finger on it.

Even when I got home I was thirsty. My friend had the grilled mahi mahi which I tasted and thought it was good. We got the sweet potato fries as an appetizer. While they were good I've had them elsewhere so it wasn't that exciting. The sweet potato fries don't hold their temperature long so you need to enjoy them fast.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is eco-friendly and asian themed. They used quite a bit of bamboo throughout the restaurant and use environmentally friendly products per the insert in the menu. Overall I liked the decor and the openess of the restaurant which is a result of the high ceilings. Regardless it's nice to be able to have room when you're dining. \n\nService was decent but nothing really spectacular.

So we sat at the bar instead so that we didn't have to wait, which turned out great cuz the bartender was very nice and both our cocktails tasted delicious!  We ordered the Firecracker Salmon roll which was very good.  We also ordered the sturgeon fish of the day which came with an avocado sauce, grilled vegetable, and sweet potato fries.  The fries were really good.  The overall portion size for the entree was just right because it still allows room for appetizer if you want.  We are small eaters so it was just right.  Our total bill was about $60 which is not too bad given we had drinks too.  We're definitely going back and will try some of the other menus.  We recommended this place to our friend who liked it too.  The only complain they had was that everything on the menu is fish but that was fine with us.\n\n1/1/2008: This is the 2nd time I've been here and I would still give it a 4 star.  We had reservations at 7pm for 7 people and they seated us late for about 10 mins and they comped all our appetizers, without us complaining or mentioning it at all.  Now that's a restaurant that cares about their customers.  It was a pleasant surprise and treat.  The service was great throughout the meal as well.  \n\nWith 7 people, we tried alot more different dishes.  \n\nAppetizers:\n1) Shrimp ceviche - They were whole shrimp and there were lots of them.  I think they should dice up the shrimp because it was served with tortilla chips and there's no way you can get a whole shrimp on the chip.  But the taste was decent overall, nothing spectacular so I probably won't order it again\n2) Grilled artichokes - Fresh, good, seasoned properly.  Would order it again.\n3) Calamari - very good, came with fried lemon slices too which is an interesting touch.  the sauce was a little spicy.  Would recommend trying this and I would order it again.\n\nRolls\n1) CA roll - good that it was real crab meat, not some doughy fake ones.  There was too much rice which will fill you up quickly.  I prefer less rice.  Probably would not order it again just because I don't think this is not a signature dish.\n\n2) Rock 'n roll - Too much rice, couldn't find/taste the unagi (bbq eel).  Again, it tastes ok, but wouldn't order it again.\n\n3) Firecracker roll - We had this last time, loved it.  This time it was still good.  For some reason, this roll doesn't not have as much rice as the other too, which is good.  Would order it again\n\nEntrees\n1) Mahi mahi fish of the day - came with grilled veggie, sweet potato fries, mahi mahi served with tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish had a cajun spice rub that was a bit pungent.  The sweet potato fries as always was great.  Grilled veggie - can't go wrong with this.  Don't like the spice rub so won't order it again\n\n2) Grilled shrimp teriyaki bowl - Very tasty, great teriyaki sauce.  Liked that it came with veggie and mushroom, chopped and mixed into the rice.   Would order it again\n\n3) Ono fish of the day - very good.  came with fried onion rings that were delicious.  came with pineapple fried rice which everyone loved.  the fish was grilled on banana leaf so it had a great aroma and taste.  would order it gain.\n\n4) Organic chinook fish of the day - it came with grilled artichoke and brown rice and the fish was served with a tomato sauce.  it was fresh and decently good.  i'm not a big grilled salmon fan so that's why i won't order it again. \n\n5) Grilled Korean beef (another daily special) - I don't eat beef so I can't comment, but my husband thought it was decent.  This place is called \"Pacific Catch\" so I'd stick with the fish but if you have a friend that doesn't like seafood, at least there is an option to have meat.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place and would go again.  Good atmosphere for couples or groups.  Great service.  Nice decor and clean.  Lots of cocktails, decent size wine list.\n\n2/14/08: This is visit #3.\n\nCocktail Review:\nSun Burn - average; menu says there's a tropical syrup in it which I think is what gave it a little after taste of some sort.\nSome cocktail with Gin 209, kiwi and cucumber juice - DELICIOUS!  We had to order a 2nd one.  \n\nHouse salad - Good size, very fresh greens, salad dressing was yummy, if you like a Japanese type kinda dressing w/miso; The mushrooms that were in the salad was delicious.  They're cooked in some sauce, not some uncooked mushroom.\n\nCatch of the Day Fish and Chips - The ling cod fish and chips is the freshest fish and chips we ever had.  It's lightly fried, lightly crispy and covered in a thick batter where you eat a lot of batter and not fish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and fresh and was juicy.  The sweet potato fries as usual, are always yummy!!!\n\nSalmon and mahi mahi taco: Both were good and fresh.  The salsa on each one are good.

The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite.

There is also some cozy outdoor seating under some heaters, but keep in mind, it is right next to the bus stop. \n\nThey start you off with some complimentary shelled edamame and pretzel goldfish, which is a cute nod to the seafood menu, but I'd still prefer bread.

Everything else was very delicious, the rice was a little bit on the tougher side. The Hawaiian Poke was quite fresh and delicious. \n\n++    2 Piece Fish and Chips with Sweet Potato Fries - $10 - 3/5 - When ordering this, there is a choice of regular, spicy, or sweet potato fries or a salad. Yelp says get the sweet potato fries! After ordering, the waitress returned and had to ask which fries I asked for. The presentation of this dish is quite cute. It comes on a newspaper themed wax/butcher paper. The fish wasn't very crispy. They were large slabs of fish, but after sitting there for under 5 minutes, the whole bottom side was soggy. No bueno. \n= The sweet potato fries were very very good when they came out hot. If you don't order the appetizer, it doesn't come with the ginger wasabi aioli, but it does come with the Thai chile sauce. Pairs really well with the Thai Chile sauce.\n\n++    Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale - $5.50 - 5/5 - YUM. Upon my first sip, I thought I was drinking an IPA, but then I looked down and saw it was a warm amber colour. Amber Pale Ale? The flavours were great, complex body, and hops off the end. Great beer, decently priced. \n\n**It's a weighted average.\n\nPRICE 3.5/5\nThe pricing is fairly average, but just a little bit on the pricier side. Nothing spectacular, but also pretty affordable for SF.\n\nSERVICE 4/5\nThe service was very very nice. My waitress smiled a lot, was very attentive. I saw in my peripheral that she would talk to the other waiters/waitresses but occasionally glance over to see I was still doing okay. She came over to see how everything wa around my half way point. Only thing is that she should have just written down my order so nothing was missed. (sauce on the side, sweet potato fries)\n\nROOM AND DECOR 5/5\nThere is plenty of seating, good for both intimate conversations and large groups. The decor is primarily fish paintings and sculptures. Very fitting.\n\nTIPS / NOTES:\n+ UCSF (students?) employees get 10% off\n+ They are currently running a $10 off if you pay with Paypal Mobile (the receipt will generate a code, you enter the code into your phone, and it'll pay them automatically.

It wasn't even until the third time did I realize they had a parking lot next to the restaurant! How handy! Such a rare find in San Francisco. \n\nFish & Chips: Everyone loves these but I don't think its their best thing there. You should definitely get 4 pieces though since its $14 and 2 pieces is already $10. The pieces of fish aren't that big. I love the sauces it comes with but the Jalapeno Tartar sauce was never spicy to me. I think the coleslaw side is far too small as well but I love their sweet potato fries (the only reason I wanted to come in the first place haha)\n\nCalifornia Roll Salad: I love this salad! Although I had it at every meal and I got kind of sick of it at the end. The salad is huge and you'll probably have a hard time finishing it.

The food was mediocre at the very best and forgettable.\n\nOn Friday, 5.27.11, I came to Pacific Catch for my friend's Birthday Dinner. We had reservations for a party of 14 at 7 pm. Upon arrival, it took about 5-7 minutes for them to set up our table and be seated.\n\nF O O D:\nThis time I did my due diligence and made sure I looked at the other Yelper's reviews to see what to order. The Poke and Sweet Potato Fries were overwhelming mentioned in many reviews, so I decided to entrust in my fellow Yelpers and I was not disappointed. Thank you, Yelpers!\n\n*HAWAIIAN POKE WASABI BOWL w/ Tobiko & Brown Rice ($14.95 +$2 for Tobiko):  YUMMY!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3bxO8T8U96uKu2numljjsw?select=GXy8_YmqbfOJ6fPhUrOi7w\n\nThe poke was hands down the BEST I've ever had! The thick chunks of tuna were uber fresh, tender and succulent. The soy wasabi sauce, albeit a bit salty, gave the tuna a nice savory sweet flavor with a hint of spice while the sesame seeds and roasted nori gave it a touch of nuttiness. The accoutrements of wakame salad, daikon sprouts, cucumber, and ginger were all very fresh and crisp. The brown rice, however, was undercooked and hard.\n\n*SWEET POTATO FRIES ($3.50 for a Side Order): DANGEROUSLY ADDICTING!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3bxO8T8U96uKu2numljjsw?select=neBvXM0nJIZivB8_tiEe7g\n\nThe fresh-out-of the fryer sweet potato fries were crispy throughout with a soft, fluffy center. The light sprinkle of salt brought out the natural sweetness of the potatoes. There were two accompanying sauces: Thai Sweet Chili and Wasabi Aioli. I preferred the Wasabi Aioli as it added a layer of creaminess with a slight nose tingle from the wasabi.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nVery friendly but slow which is understandable because we were in a large party and the restaurant was packed. Nevertheless, the staff did a good job making sure everyone got their entrees at the same time although the last three took 5 minutes longer than the others. I did have to ask several times for my water glass to be refilled so perhaps leaving a water pitcher for larger parties may be a good idea.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nContemporary and fun; Pacific Catch is good for casual lunch and dinners. Since it's a large restaurant, it's also good for large parties. The noise level is very, very loud though so it's very likely you'll have to scream across the table if you want to be heard.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nAlthough Pacific Catch has a small lot with a 10-car capacity, getting a parking space in that lot is like hitting the jackpot. Street parking is no easy task either so make sure to allot an extra 15 minutes to find parking. Your best bet is looking for parking at Golden Gate Park which is just across the street. \n\nThe is one of the few times that Yelpers didn't lead me astray, so if you're coming to Pacific Catch, definitely order the Poke and Sweet Potato Fries.

I had the following in the order of favorite to least favorite:\n\nAsparagus & Shiitake Roll: It was an interesting vegetarian take on a sushi roll and I found the asparagus tempura and the tiny strings of mushroom and carrot to be quite lovely.\n\nThai Coconut Shrimp: It's funny because when I had my first bite, I was like \"OMG...it feels like a Thai restaurant in my mouth.\"  Now looking at the menu as I write this entry, the dish's name is quite befitting. The coconut flavors are so quintessentially Thai.  I loved the crunch of the crispy coconut flakes and the juicy shrimp.  Frankly, I ended up just eating the coconut flake outer layer instead of the shrimp because it was so good.  The sweet and sour dipping sauce (that you can buy at any Asian market) was a nice complement. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: This roll was actually spicy, which I appreciated.  It was yummy with the bitterness of the daikon sprouts.  \n\nHawaiian Poke:  This was a disappointment as everyone had been raving about it.  Mainly because the poke tasted so gummy.  It did not simply melt in my mouth and the chopped green onions were a bit too overpowering.  I do like my poke to be marinated for a few hours so that the fish really soaks up the flavors but I just felt it had been marinated too long.

NO PARKING during evening hours stated clearly on the signs, but many cars were parked. A cop car drove in and I decided not to risk it. They do have a small parking lot next to the restaurant, but it fills up quickly. I suggest biking or walking. What better way to burn off those after dinner calories than riding/taking a stroll in GG park (warning: it gets really dark in there at night)?!\n\n- Salmon Teriyaki Bowl ($14.95): Asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, grilled bok choy, sesame seeds with teriyaki sauce, served over pineapple fried rice (I substituted with brown rice). The brown rice was a little too hard for my liking. Other than that, I really liked the abundance of vegetables and the sweet/flavorful mix of pineapple in the rice was delicious. \n\n- Sushi Grade Ahi Salad ($12.95): Subsituted with Hawaiian Poke. Avocado, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds with soy-wasabi vinaigrette. The portion size of this salad is quite generous, great for a meal or for sharing with another dish. The poke accompanied the vegetables well giving me a healthy yet satisfying feeling of fullness. \n\n- Pineapple-Orange-Guava juice ($2.95): Tasted just how it sounds like; a mixture of all 3 with the guava juice standing out the most. Came in a pretty small glass, so I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. \n\nNo reservations were made and there were plenty of empty tables in the main dining area, but the hostess escorted us and said the only table available was in the bar area. I did not even see the empty tables in the dining area fill up throughout my meal. I don't like the tables at the bar, not much leg room. Other than that, service was quick and efficient.

I ended up sitting next to my boyfriend, which is nice, but I like sitting across from him so we can talk easier. Our waiter (his name totally slipped my mind, sorry!) was nice and attentive. Took our orders and our appetizers came out in like 10 minutes! Kind of threw me off on how fast it came out. \n\nwe ordered: \n\n- Sweet Potato Fries: My boyfriend is a fries fiend so he totally enjoyed this. I'm not that big on fries, but I must admit that it was pretty delish. \n\n- Hawaiian Poke: My absolute fave of the night. I always have to try poke if a restaurant has it on their menu and this one totally hit the spot. Not as good as homemade, but close enough! Could do without the won ton chips. Would have been great with a seaweed salad. \n\n- Cabo Calamari: This is another dish we usually always try if it's on the menu. We were quite disappointed. Usually when you eat a piece of calamari without the sauce, it should still have some flavor from the breading its coated in, but this was just so...BLAND. Then when we dipped it in the sauce, it completely broke apart. No good. \n\n- Miso Glazed Salmon: Loved the crispy outside and buttery inside. Sauce, mushroom & edamame side, was delicious. The salad on the side was not to my liking. I don't know what it was, but the flavor was horrible and the texture was really tough. \n\n- Korean BBQ Steak: First of all, the waiter hadn't asked my boyfriend how he wanted it cooked. It came out medium rare which was fine though. Tim loved the flavor, but the meat was TOUGH. Don't think it was the way it was cooked, just that that particular cut of meat was tough. He also didn't like the salad. \n\n- Lemongrass Mojito: Pretty good. Bartender made it strong, just the way I like it. \n\nOverall, it was alright. If I were to go back it would be for the sweet potato fries, Hawaiian poke, and maybe to try the Wasabi Bowls and fish tacos.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["The Japanese Wasabi Bowl with Hawaiian Poke was delicious and very filling.

All good...beauiful day in the sunset...cant beat those!!  Walked past the cute little tables in their patio and was seated right away and attended to.  The entire menu looked super yum!  I seriously had to narrow it down from sweet potato fries, crispy oysters, teriyaki bowls, macademia crusted seabass, catfish sandwich, sushi....it was rather extensive!!  We finally narrowed it down to....\n\nSpicy Fries:  Normal fries just tossed with a cajun seasoning I think.  I LOVE fries so it was a great version...especially since they were \"skinny\" fries that were super crispy.  The dipping sauces were a nice touch: sweet chili sauce (the one for lumpia!!...I blended that combo LONG before I came here!!  I like their thinking here) and a creamy miso dip!!  yum!!  Mix them together...its perfect!\n\nSalmon Wasabi Bowl:  I thought it was going to be raw salmon but it turned out to be grilled. Apparently the raw stuff is the Hawaiian Poke?  How the hell was I suppose to know that??!!  I wish there was a description on the menu.  Boooo!!  Even though I was in the mood for raw fish the salmon was a great compliment to the brown rice covered with a wasabi miso sauce, radish sprouts, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, pickled ginger and avocado.  It was all the ingredients to a honkin sushi roll but in a bowl.  For about $15, the portions were huge, fresh, and tastey.  I probably ate a little less than half and was STUFFED!  \n\nTuna Wasabi Bowl: Same condiments in the bowl just with lighly seared tuna.\n\nI think I was a little disappointed that the salmon was cooked, obviously my fault, but I still enjoyed my meal.  Looking around at the other tables and their selections, the wasabi bowl was probably the best priced dish.  The menu will definitely bring me back to finalize their rating.

I've had fun happy hour times with some friends and even quick one drink hang outs. I had not eaten here in over a year and was excited when the opportunity came to indulge in a yummy lunch. After Bay to Breakers, my friends went to Gordos (YUM) and I chose to order take out from Pacific Catch. I requested the seared ahi rice bowl.  Excited to chow down, I ran to Gordos and proceeded to stuff my face. However, one thing felt wrong. The fish did not taste the same. Again, here is another place that overloads on the sodium to masque the taste of their food. Not only was the fish too salty, but there was something fishy about the fish. After a while, I decided to cease my \"chow down\" and wrapped the food back into the bag. There is a huge problem if I order food and do not devour the entire thing. This means I either am not hungry or the food does not taste good. Thinking that I must not have been hungry, I decided to eat the bowl later that day. From the moment I went to my bfs house to later that afternoon, my stomach was hurting. I assumed it was due to the hangover from B2B, but it did not make sense.

Everything was neatly proportioned...a couple slivers of avacado, wakame salad, radish, a lotta poke, etc.  When I took my first bite, I nearly grimaced.  I forgot to request no wasabe sauce.

It's a big, comfortable-looking restaurant with a large-ish bar area facing the Park. The menu has a large selection of seafood dishes (as the restaurant name would suggest) done in a variety of fusion-ish ways. Some of these are predictable, and in my experience, not that exciting. I have had the Fish & Chips and the Fish Tacos in the past, and I wasnt very impressed by either. (Big portions... though on the flip-side, the prices are on the high side.) However, I was very impressed by some of the more unusual and interesting dishes. In particular, the different Rice Bowl options are very good. I have become addicted to the  Hawaiian Poke Rice Bowl & Brown Rice. VERY tasty, and it feels healthy, with its variety of veggies and carbs (though it probably isnt!)\n\nThe place itself feels a bit impersonal - especially, the large restaurant area. It has the feel (just a bit...) of a suburban Red Lobster or TGI Friday's. (Not anything like as cheezy -- but there's a sense of it - not a good thing in an area where there are so many other places that do have personality & character.) The bar feels a bit better - tho the quality of the wait-staff & bartenders is hit-and-miss. \n\nSo - definitely ambivalent about the place, and typically, the price-tab for a meal is a bit on the high side  - but Pacific Catch has its upsides.

This sad dish looked like it had been sitting out all day--scallops looked dried out and definitely not fresh. There were little pieces of mango in the dish but there just wasn't much natural sweetness to the scallops so it isn't something I'd order again. I ordered the Chirashi which was literally $23 of old poke served on a platter of very little sushi rice. The ahi was gristly as all hell--I ended up spitting out 1/4 of it because I simply could not chew it down enough to swallow. Both the ahi and salmon looked days old and was very low quality raw fish. For being in San Francisco, I wouldn't even give this a rating of mediocre because it was far below that.

It had tuna, wakame salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, cucumber, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori and soy-wasabi sauce.  I agree with other Yelpers.  The portion was huge and had a lot of rice but not much fish.  $15 was a little bit over price.  But the taste was pretty good.   The fish was fresh and flavorful.  I got half brown rice and half salad.  All ingredients were very fresh and tasty.  The only thing is the soy-wasabi sauce was little bit too much.  Kinda of salty to me.\n\nMy sister got the Ahi Rice Bowl ($15).  The ingredients were the same as the other rice bowls except the fish.  Ahi was very fresh.  I did not read the menu carefully.

The place wasn't crowded when we came so we didn't have to wait for a table, which is always nice.  We saw one table had ordered the Baja Shrimp Ceviche so we decided to start with that.   The presentation was really cool.  The ceviche, stuffed full of shrimp and avocado, was served in a tall martini glass with a pile of tortilla chips sprawled around the base.  The best thing about this dish was how much shrimp they gave us!  It's always annoying when you pay a premium for a shrimp entre and get 3 shrimp.  We counted each shrimp as we were going through the ceviche, they were good sized shrimp mind you, and ended up with almost 20! The chef was overly generous with the shrimp for the price we payed.\n\nFor my entre, I went with 3 tacos; 1 BBQ salmon with corn salsa and lime crema, 1 tropical grilled shrimp with mango salsa, and 1 spice-rubbed grilled mahi mahi with avocado tomatilla salsa.

"], "author": "Jason F.", "review": "Pacific Catch West Coast Fish House is a solid place to get good if unspectacular seafood dishes like soft tacos, poke and rice bowls and sushi rolls. This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite.

If you are under 6' tall and on the slender side, you'll be just fine.\n\nThe servers are very friendly and attentive, which is a pleasant departure from many restaurants in San Francisco, where courteous service sometimes seems to have been otherwise forgotten in the shuffle.  Pacific Catch seems to operate the way many serious, highly rated professional restaurant environments do, with a highly trained staff, attention to detail overall, and a menu that reflects modern trends.  For example, this menu offers not only foodie versions of Miso soup, but also a brown rice substitution option for those of us watching our waistlines or simply attempting to eat a more healthy diet.  \n\nI recommend the coconut skewered shrimp and ordering anything that will get you some of their delicious sweet potato fries (healthier than regular fries, at least!)!

Still, the presentation of the bowl, which arrived covered and was quickly de-topped by the server at the table, gives at least some clue as to what your money buys here:  a higher end experience, even if it's at a chain restaurant, even if the menu looks like a mash-up of Sushi-Bar-Meets-Fish'n'Chips-Joint, even if it's a Monday night in the Inner Sunset.  \n\nThere's something to be said for a restaurant that does what it does well.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-02-27"}], "sticky ribs": [{"excerpts": ["We had the Korean Sticky Ribs and Calamari for our appetizers.

Whether it's because they've been around for so long or because I've b een here so many times, it's gotten to the point now where they just kind of fade into the background for me.  Which might explain why, despite all of those trips here, I've still never written a review for these guys!  Although, I could've sworn I wrote something about them at some point over the years...\n\nWhile the place is starting to show a bit of its age (though they did convert part of their entry way into an outdoor seating area with a fire pit), Pacific Catch hasn't let its menu get outdated.

From their appetizers and fish tacos to their fish & chips and daily chalkboard specials, the food at Pacific Catch is generally pretty fresh...except for all of their fried stuff, like their Mixed Catch plate that my buddy likes).  However, whether it's been when I've dined in or when I used to get takeout, I usually end up getting the same thing every time - their JAPANESE WASABI BOWL with Poke ($16.50).\n\nFilled with Seaweed Salad, Avocado, Daikon Salad, Ginger, Sesame Seeds, Shredded Nori, and Soy-Wasabi Sauce, this isn't bad, but lacking compared to what you can get from poke joints.  While their poke (tuna) is generally pretty fresh, everything else is hit or miss.  The seaweed salad and avocado are good, but I'm not a fan of their daikon salad and the sauce is just okay (I personally prefer ponzu-based ones).  What's more, the rice can be a little inconsistent (can be overcooked).\n\nDespite how their food may not strike me like how it used to, I certainly appreciate how steady and consistent Pacific Catch has been.  From my first trip here, to the time we sat at their bar and watched the Giants clinch the 2014 World Series, to this most recent trip, the food hasn't changed much, for better or worse.

So Pacific Catch has an upscale look and feel to the place. Nice decor, lighting and a friendly wait staff.  But the menu is not vegetarian friendly.  Lot of choices (sake salmon, calamari, thai coconut shrimp, tuna tataki etc etc...) if you like your meats and fish but not if you're vegetarian.  Most places in SF by now have a section on their menu for vegetarians. Not here.

My face was red and I was pretty buzzed.

You get a slice of salmon that you can't even see at all, but can taste it. I swear the slice of the salmon was the thickness of 10 sheets of paper... not the filet that you would expect from a salmon sandwich. The bread was not toasted and so it was cold and not warm and crispy. I think texture is key when making a sandwich, you get the lettuce, tomato, avocado and salmon (all of which have a moist texture -- except the lettuce) and you want the bread to add a different texture... this is just me, I like my bread warm and crispy. As for flavor, it had enough flavor and it was actually tasty, just sad that the main attraction in this sandwich was nowhere to be seen.\n\nService was great!

Be sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite, otherwise you're left with a lots of rice at the bottom of the bowl. \n\n$15.50 Ahi Tuna Salad w/ seared ahi, greens & romaine, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, soy-wasabi vinaigrette:\nWhen I want something lighter, I'll go for the salad. The ingredients are pretty much the same, but with lettuce instead of rice. But with a salad, I go for the seared tuna instead of poke, because it creates the illusion of a meatier salad. Again, try to eat a little of everything together, otherwise you're left with a ton of greens, or as my friend calls it, 'rabbit food.'\n\nA lot of people like the sweet potato fries.

I really wanted to order the famous rice bowls but I opted for ahi tuna 3 ways!!!! And 3 ways I was pleased.  Sweetie got the beef with prawns.  I don't know what it was called because I was busy concentrating on my tuna.  He said his was delicious except it was not enough. (Disclaimer:  my sweetie is a hefty eater. Pacific Catch's portions are adequate for normal human eaters like me who is Asian, petite but can pack  it in once in a while if the food is yummy!)  \n\nThen we shared the mochi fondue which was nice contrast between the hot and the cold.

I still could not give it 5 stars, though, even though the venue was hip and welcoming.

Since I had a $20 Opentable cheque to use and some friends actually said good things about the new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.  Oh and also, nothing seems to be open on Easter Sunday for dinner and we desperately needed to take a friend out for his birthday. \n\nWe had a reservation for 6:30 and one of us was very late, but the hostess and waitress gave us no grief and didn't make us feel guilty at all.  That's a giant plus for me.  It didn't seem like a lot of people made reservations, as our table was the only visible one with the sign \"reservation\" on it.  \n\nThe decor, well, I get it, it's Hawaiian themed.  The color is a bit loud for me and made the space look much smaller than its actual size.  I am glad they retained the high ceiling that I loved when it was Canvas, and we were all in awe that we were sitting where the middle bar used to be.  One thing I really didn't like was the carpet.  It was just ugly.  I don't see why they couldn't do some sort of chic hardwood floor.  And the noise level---it sounded like Happy Hour with a hundred suits packed in some Financial District bar at 5.  \n\nOur waitress was prompt and friendly and efficient.  Our dishes arrived timely.  Among the three of us, we had a basket of sweet potato fries, which was enormous (I mean, it doesn't look like much but sweet potatoes can be dense!)  I don't think anyone can mess up on sweet potato fries, so I was happy.  The sauces were pretty good, but I prefer to eat them without anything.  \n\nI had an unsweetened iced tea, which reminded me of the iced tea from the Grove.  Meaning, it's good---fruity aroma but not actually really sweet.  My boyfriend had a glass of sake.   Our friend had a mojito, which looked really good. \n\nWe wanted to get some grilled corn but apparently they ran out, cuz it was a nice day and therefore everyone ordered corn (our waitress' explanation).  But she came back and told us the kitchen managed to find a piece so they will throw that in our dish.  Free corn?  I was thrilled.  But it was just okay.  I imagined it to be that famous Mexican grilled corn from Cafe Habana in New York, but nope, just your ordinary slightly charred, buttery, hard corn.  Kinda disappointing.\n\nFor entree, I had the ahi poke wasabi bowl.  I am not a huge wasabi fan, but I do enjoy wasabi noodles from the House and thought it might be a subtle flavor like that.  It basically came as a giant bowl with every ingredient you can find in a tuna roll, but deconstructed, and enlarged.  I didn't think the rice was flavored enough to be called \"sushi rice.\"  But the ahi poke was delicious and the soy-wasabi sauce was pungent and flavorful.  Did I mention it's giant?  After my indulgence on sweet potato fries and a piece of corn, I could only finish a quarter of my rice bowl.  I think it'll be good as left over. \n\nThe other two had the specials, sturgeon and some other fish---I can't remember!  Both fish dishes looked just alright to me that I didn't even feel tempted to try them, but they both claimed that the dishes were good.  So I will take their word for it.  \n\nWe also shared a macadamia nut brownie with ice cream.  It was nice and sweet, and comes in a good portion for sharing.  \n\nThe restaurant was packed around 6:30 but by the time we left at 9, it was practically empty.  Sorta surprising to me that people ate so early.  I was glad that no one pressured us to leave long after we ate everything and paid and sat around.  But then again, it wasn't like they needed the table or anything. \n\nI would go back for the fries.
