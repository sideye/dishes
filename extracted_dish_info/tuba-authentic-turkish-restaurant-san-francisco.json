The restaurant space is small, and was crowded when we arrived.  There is no dedicated waiting area, so the majority of diners waiting for a table have to huddle awkwardly by the door, or lurk next to someone's table. \n\nSERVICE: Friendly, apologetic... but... not the greatest.  For one thing, we arrived a few min early (5) for our 8:30PM reservation, only to be told by the owner (? An older gentleman) that he was so sorry, but we would have to wait a few minutes, on account of our early arrival.  Ok, NBD, we stand outside the doorway like awkward creepers and check out their menu.  We ended up waiting for over 15min before I requested to be seated outdoors.  They quickly set up the table, and we ordered pretty much immediately upon sitting down.  It took them another 15min to bring us water, which they never refilled.\n\nFOOD: The food arrived lukewarm to cold at our table... which was quite unappetizing.\n- Falafel ($7): Very loosely packed falafels (4) with a small mound of hummus.  This app came out nice and hot, and was fairly satisfying.  I prefer a denser falafel but the flavor of these were good.\n- Mercimek Corbasi (bowl $7): Red lentil soup in a bowl was a decent sized portion, but did not come out quite as hot as I would've liked.

The complimentary flatbread they bring out was yummy and perfect for eating with the accompanying seasoned butter, olives, and feta as well as the cold mezes. We also used the bread to pick up the oils from the mezes. The waitress brought us another basket presumably after seeing us wolf down the first plate of bread.     \n\nKIZARTMA (Cold Meze)\nThis appetizer came in two mounds of pan-fried eggplant, bell peppers, and zucchini topped with tomato sauce. (Both mezes came in twos actually.) I loved the natural sweetness of the vegetables (technically fruits but you know what I mean). And they were chopped and cooked to perfection. The small scoops left me craving more. \n\nCEVIZLI EZME (Cold Meze)\nA mix of walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin, this  signature meze had incredibly deep flavor. It was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The walnuts added a nice, nutty texture. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this combination of ingredients. I also appreciated the bed of spinach.  \n\nADANA KEBAB\nA succulent kebab of spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers. The meat was very tender and easy to chew. I didn't think it was spicy at all. The portion was extremely small and probably not worth the price. It did come with rice and grilled and pickled vegetables which took up most of the plate.  \n\nKARNIYARIK (Signature Entree)\nMy favorite out of the two entrees. Even though there was half of a whole eggplant, I wished there was more of it. The baked eggplant was wonderfully tender, but its subtle flavor was overpowered by the ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and chopped parsley stuffing which was exceptionally seasoned. The flavor was very rich and deep. I could see it pairing quite well with pasta. Although I appreciate leafy greens, the salad was a bit boring. \n\nAll in all, I had a very enjoyable and hearty meal here. Everything was so flavorful and aromatic. \nI noticed that prices have gone up by $2 for the Cold Mezes and $3 for the Signature Entrees based on the menu posted in 2014 which is somewhat more reasonable than another place I went to that started raising their prices within a month.

The fish was delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked.  They offered to debone it for us but still presented it as if it were whole.  The sea bream came with a salad, vegetables and pickles.  \n\nCups of turkish tea and a plate of Kunefe, sweet cheese coated in shredded phyllo soaked in syrup and nuts rounded out the meal.  The dessert wasn't too sweet or too rich and paired well with the earthiness of the tea.\n\nThe portions sizes were just right and I felt the prices were fair for the quality of the meal.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was full the entire time of our visit and service never lapsed.\n\nThe restaurant is located in what I regard as the quieter section of the Mission such that parking was fairly easy (okay, I really lucked out).

The meaning of life is contemplated over a cup of warm Turkish tea. \n\nDark no-running cloud hovering my heart. Just then, he said, when you get better, we should try that Egyptian place in Outer Richmond. \"Remember that place?\" Yes indeed. We ate dinner after running once by there.

We arrived late due to traffic and walked in at 6:15pm. Parking wasn't bad, but you definitely have to look.\n\nThe restaurant only had 2 other tables when we sat down. This place is very quaint. Dim lightening, colorful decor, and a special scent within the restaurant. It was relaxing, yet very classy. We were than greeted by a waitress that handed us the menu and poured us glasses of water. Being the very first time of having Turkish cuisine for both of us...we needed some time to digest the menu. \n\nMomentarily, this gentlemen came over and asked if it was our first time. We later on figured out his name was Burke. He gave us recommendations and was very personable. As my boyfriend butcher the names of the dishes, Burke was so nice to tell us that it is pronounced the way it looks. We decided to go with:\n\nAppetizer: Cevizli Ezme Walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, and tomato paste with fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin. SO GOOD! The bread was fresh and delicious. The red pepper paste really caught Mr.MC's attention. It complimented the bread very well. It was tasty.\n\nFor entrees, we went ahead and ordered two to share:\nSarma Beyti Kebab\u0131 -  Adana kebab wrapped in lava\u015f bread, topped with homemade\ntomato and garlic yogurt sauce. VERY saucy. If you are not someone that likes too much sauce, you might not like this dish. However, this dish was very flavorful. The garlic yogurt sauce was just right. It wasn't sour or anything. It was a generous portion.\n\nMant\u0131 - Dumplings stuffed with ground beef, topped with garlic yogurt sauce,\npepper flakes and dried mint. The dumpling were tiny! They were bite-sized! But the meat within was very fresh. The ground beef was a tad bit dry, however, it didn't both us because it paired well with the the sauce as well. \n\nBread and water were refilled without request. We were able to eat the bread with the yogurt sauce as well!\n\nAt the end, we were stuffed but we HAD to order Pyramid Noisette Chocolate to satisfy my sweet cravings and 2 orders of the Turkish coffee. I am a coffee lover and I approve! Turns out Turkish coffee isn't in a cup or glass, it actually comes in a super tiny small mug shot.

I also recommend the Haydari, cucumbers, mint and dill, to accompany your richer dishes like H\u00fcnkar Be\u011fendi, pureed aubergine with leg of lamb.  The last time we dined here, we went with our veggie friends and decided to go vegetarian with them for the evening. This proved to be very easy as many of their dishes, especially the mezes are vegetarian.  Our friends said it was possibly some of the best food they've ever had.

It was muggy outside and the heat carried into the restaurant which unsurprisingly does not have AC. SF is not equipped for this kind of weather.

The complimentary flatbread they bring out was yummy and perfect for eating with the accompanying seasoned butter, olives, and feta as well as the cold mezes. We also used the bread to pick up the oils from the mezes.

The small scoops left me craving more. \n\nCEVIZLI EZME (Cold Meze)\nA mix of walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin, this  signature meze had incredibly deep flavor. It was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The walnuts added a nice, nutty texture. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this combination of ingredients. I also appreciated the bed of spinach.  \n\nADANA KEBAB\nA succulent kebab of spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers. The meat was very tender and easy to chew. I didn't think it was spicy at all. The portion was extremely small and probably not worth the price. It did come with rice and grilled and pickled vegetables which took up most of the plate.  \n\nKARNIYARIK (Signature Entree)\nMy favorite out of the two entrees. Even though there was half of a whole eggplant, I wished there was more of it. The baked eggplant was wonderfully tender, but its subtle flavor was overpowered by the ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and chopped parsley stuffing which was exceptionally seasoned. The flavor was very rich and deep. I could see it pairing quite well with pasta. Although I appreciate leafy greens, the salad was a bit boring. \n\nAll in all, I had a very enjoyable and hearty meal here. Everything was so flavorful and aromatic. \nI noticed that prices have gone up by $2 for the Cold Mezes and $3 for the Signature Entrees based on the menu posted in 2014 which is somewhat more reasonable than another place I went to that started raising their prices within a month.

For those who don't know, it's essentially zucchini and other random green vegetables mashed together and fried into a ball using an egg batter that's a little heavy on the dill. It reminded of me aunt's cooking and it might have actually been the highlight of the meal!\n\nWe then had the hunkar begendi (bay-end-ee), which was a creamy pile of eggplant mush, heavy on garlic, with pieces of lamb in it. If you like eggplant, you should definitely get this dish. If you don't, avoid it all costs. Because you're really just eating delicious eggplant mush.\n\nLast, we had the mixed grill, which had a chicken kebab, lamb kebab, kofte kebab, adana kebab, and the world's tiniest single lamb chop. The tiny lamb chop of good, the kofte kebab standard, and the chicken/lamb kebab forgettable (as they usually are most everywhere). That said, the adana kebab was awesome. Really spicy all the way through the meat, flavorful, cooked just right. I'd go back here just for more adana kebab. Awesome.\n\nThe services was Turkish-friendly and they made ice tea out of Turkish tea, which is why I was on a caffeine high until 2am. Overall, this might be the best Turkish restaurant in San Francisco right now.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The Mucver (zucchini fritters) also had great flavor but was too wet in the center both times I ordered them.

You will LOVE their lamb.  no? why?  you don't like gamey meat?  You will LOVE their lamb.  Oh my god!  Thank you. Finally.  A place that knows how to prepare and cook lamb.  There is not one hint of gaminess.  It is simply delicious.  The lamb chops are marinated for 3 days and oh so delish.  I had the lamb shank special, and it was literally falling off the bone - fork tender and delicious.  So so so delicious.  Did I say try the lamb?  Really.. if you read any of my reviews, because I know how lamb is \"supposed\"to taste (like it does here) I have a hard time eating it in places that don't know how to prepare it. \n\nThe falafel with the goat cheese center... YUM!  oh so good. \n\nMy brother really liked the Cevizli Ezme (walnut red pepper paste)\n\nI also highly recommend the crabcake, falafel, and borek (boregi). The lentil soup is wonderful, fresh & hit the spot. I wouldn't say it is the 'best\" but I will definitely order it again.  \n\nThe feta prawns I thought were ok- my mom loved them. \n\nThe icli kofte (kibbeh) was not crispy on the outside as it should be, but had good flavor.  I would order it again hoping that it was an off batch. \n\nThe Mucver (zucchini fritters) also had great flavor but was too wet in the center both times I ordered them.  It may be a consistency you like, but I prefer it them a bit more dry & with a little bit of crispiness on the outside.  \n\nFor dessert we got the baklava, Pyramid Noisette Chocolate, and Kunefe. My favorite was the pyramid. The kunefe was so good. The baklava was a bit dry & I was told that it depends on the batch of baklava, since it is made in house.

It could be a steakhouse or a Z Gallerie exhibit, it didn't ring anything resembling Turkish.  Bottomline, it didn't transport me (and that's what I liked most in ethnic dining).  No music, no dancing, and no special d\u00e9cor.  So food, service, vibe, and energy is what's left to enjoy, and judge further.\n\nService\n=======\n...is a high-point.

That probably wasn't so necessary as the restaurant was still quite empty at 6 and there were plenty of two-person tables. The place did become quite filled by the time we left around 7pm. It was muggy outside and the heat carried into the restaurant which unsurprisingly does not have AC. SF is not equipped for this kind of weather. It thankfully cooled down as the sun set. \n\nThe flavors of the dishes we had were all delicious but the amount of food felt incredibly small. Portion control, I guess. The service was excellent. The complimentary flatbread they bring out was yummy and perfect for eating with the accompanying seasoned butter, olives, and feta as well as the cold mezes. We also used the bread to pick up the oils from the mezes. The waitress brought us another basket presumably after seeing us wolf down the first plate of bread.     \n\nKIZARTMA (Cold Meze)\nThis appetizer came in two mounds of pan-fried eggplant, bell peppers, and zucchini topped with tomato sauce. (Both mezes came in twos actually.) I loved the natural sweetness of the vegetables (technically fruits but you know what I mean). And they were chopped and cooked to perfection. The small scoops left me craving more. \n\nCEVIZLI EZME (Cold Meze)\nA mix of walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin, this  signature meze had incredibly deep flavor. It was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The walnuts added a nice, nutty texture. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this combination of ingredients. I also appreciated the bed of spinach.  \n\nADANA KEBAB\nA succulent kebab of spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers. The meat was very tender and easy to chew. I didn't think it was spicy at all. The portion was extremely small and probably not worth the price. It did come with rice and grilled and pickled vegetables which took up most of the plate.  \n\nKARNIYARIK (Signature Entree)\nMy favorite out of the two entrees. Even though there was half of a whole eggplant, I wished there was more of it. The baked eggplant was wonderfully tender, but its subtle flavor was overpowered by the ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and chopped parsley stuffing which was exceptionally seasoned. The flavor was very rich and deep. I could see it pairing quite well with pasta. Although I appreciate leafy greens, the salad was a bit boring. \n\nAll in all, I had a very enjoyable and hearty meal here. Everything was so flavorful and aromatic. \nI noticed that prices have gone up by $2 for the Cold Mezes and $3 for the Signature Entrees based on the menu posted in 2014 which is somewhat more reasonable than another place I went to that started raising their prices within a month.

I am very familiar with Turkish food, so I will admit that the dips were all very authentic, with warm bread served it was heavenly.\n\nAll main courses were good as well, nice presentation. The danger of ordering lamb kebab is that it can be dry, but this one was perfectly cooked. This is not some intricate creative upscale cooking, but good solid Turkish food, prepared with love.\n\nMost of their wines are from Turkey. I didn't care for red wines (sampled one), but the white wine we had was excellent. \n\nWe also ordered kanafee for desert, and I must say, it was the best one I've had in a while (and the capital of best kanafee is Nablus, Palestine, and thought Tuba's was better). Perfect temperature, often it is too warm or too cold. \n\nService is outstanding. \n\nThe only recommendation is perhaps to play more subtle music, folk music, instead of loud Turkish pop.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-10-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Husband got the Adana kebab in lavas bread ", "and I got the lamb chops ", "and it was amazing!

My husband had the Sarma Beyti Kebab\u0131 -- Adana kebab wrapped in lava\u015f bread and topped with tomato and garlic yogurt sauce -- also wonderful and flavorful.

You can have it with ice cream, we opted to leave it plain. It was delicious as was the Turkish coffee - I asked for it not to be too strong and medium sweet and it was PERFECT.\n\nIt's a wee bit crowded, the tables somewhat closer than I like, but the atmosphere overall was very nice and relaxed. Our only quibble was the service was...strange. A waitress appeared almost immediately after we were seated to tell us the specials and then asked to take our order - being new to the restaurant, we needed more time to look over the menu, but she never came back. The owner/manager came over, asked if we wanted wine - we didn't - and then hovered a moment, so we figured he wanted to take our order, so we gave him our appetizer order and he said, \"I will let them know\" and left without taking our entree order. The appetizer arrived very quickly, but no one came back to take our entree order even though we still had the menus on our table. We were busy eating the appetizer and almost done with it by the time I realized our entree order hadn't been taken, so I told said something when our water was refilled and we finally made our order. The dishes arrived pretty quickly, so it wasn't like we were waiting forever for our food, but it was still strange. And the couple who was dining next to us had to ask repeatedly for a sharper knife to cut the lamb he had for an entre - the butter knife just wasn't doing the job even though the lamb was tender. \n\nSo....great food...the service was strange for us, but not to the point that we wouldn't go back there again since we got our food in good time and it was all delicious (which is why we go to restaurants in the first place).", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["We had the Adana Kebab which was gluten free!

", "It was plenty of food for both of us after all the appetizers, and yet another affirmation that Oh. ", "Yes. "], "author": "Yakamoz S.", "review": "Merhaba Tuba! Welcome to my neighborhood; I've been waiting for you for soooo long!\n\nI can't begin to describe how excited I am about this place. When people ask me what I miss about Turkey (I moved to the US in 1994), my answer  always begins with the same duo: \"I miss the Aegean Sea and I miss the food.\" I always add that I also miss Turkish hospitality. \n\nWell. \n\nThe Aegean Sea remains far away, but Tuba brings to my adopted home, the Mission, both the food and the hospitality that I'd been missing. \n\nReservations (in response to an earlier review): I made reservations on Opentable.com, and upon arriving at the restaurant (a little after 6 pm--I was rushing to get to a show that night), I realized I didn't need to. The place was empty when I arrived. I think more people began coming in around 6:30 or so. By the time I left the restaurant around 7:30 pm, the restaurant was full, but there were still tables available. My suggestion: if you can, use Opentable.com -- it's handy, has an iPhone app, and you get credit the more you use it.  \n\nHospitality: My partner-in-crime wasn't there when I arrived at Tuba, so I stood there for a second, looking at the menu. The owner immediately noticed me and welcomed me in. As soon as I sat down, he asked if I would like some tea or coffee while I waited. We chatted a bit about his restaurant, and because he doesn't have his liquor license yet, he encouraged me to bring my own from the store at the end of the block if I needed some beer or wine with my meal. He mentioned he expects to get his license in the next two weeks (this was about a week ago). He was happy to provide a corkscrew or a bottle opener and glasses for us. Such a warm person. I immediately felt at home in this space, and getting to speak in Turkish with him was an added bonus. \n\nThe food: My ultimate test of authenticity is the dolma. I can walk into a Middle Eastern caf\u00e9, take one look at the dolmas, and be able to tell whether they're from a can or homemade (sorry to say, folks, most of the time, they're from a can). A restaurant, of course, is different. I asked our waiter if they were homemade just in case, and they were...and they were almost as good as grandma's. Almost. My partner-in-crime, who apparently doesn't usually like dolma, ate all of his, so there you go. \n\nThe other appetizers we got were the sigara b\u00f6rek and ezme (the regular kind, not the zucchini kind). The b\u00f6rek was great (careful with your first bite--it's hot!), and the ezme was out of this world. We tried in vain to stop ourselves from spreading the ezme on the delicious pide (not pita) bread so we didn't get too full. \n\nWell, we did get too full, and we weren't so hungry at 6 pm to begin with. Fortunately, we had ordered the mixed grill to share (the one-person version rather than the mixed grill for two). It came with lamb chop (fantastic!), chicken kebab, shish kebab, adana kebab, rice, and veggies (I think I'm forgetting one more kind of kebab on there). It was plenty of food for both of us after all the appetizers, and yet another affirmation that Oh. Yes. I do looooove meat on a skewer. \n\nWith no room for dessert, I had to skip the irmik helvasi that I was looking forward to sampling. Next time! \n\nJust thinking about the menu makes my mouth water. There's so much variety and deliciousness on that menu that I just can't wait to return! \n\nBonus points for Tuba: \n1. As someone who learned English as a second language, and who is now an English teacher, I have an instinctive habit of recognizing typos and grammatical errors on menus, especially when they're not American restaurants. I saw no errors on Tuba's menu. \n2.

I love the texture too. The dish was smaller than I thought, but it was more than enough to go with all our bread, plus we had leftovers. \n\nSIGNATURE ENTREES\n* Sarma Beyti Kebab (adana kebab wrapped in lavas bread, broiled, topped w/ homemade tomato & garlic yogurt sauce. $20) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#bE-KpN3-zG9ZRfeVPOrxrA\nVery very tasty. The lavas bread was soft and had a great consistency, but held together well. The kebab meat was dense and full of flavor. The sauces were fantastic. This came with a big slice of roasted green pepper (very spicy!) and tomato, which were a little out of place as you had to go out of your way to cut small pieces of both and mix it in with a bite of the sauce and the meat/bread.\n\n* Karniyarik (eggplant, stuffed w/ ground beef, tomatoes, onions, chopped parsley, then baked. rice & salad. $18) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#Ebl4uCw0CmeJya3CvqypAg\nThe ground beef mixture was really great! However, I wish the flavor had soaked more into the eggplant. If you took a cross-section slice of the eggplant, it was about 60% eggplant (which was bland and a little dry, plus the skin was super tough), but the meat was great. The rice and onions actually had pretty good flavor. The salad was simple.\n\nDinner menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw\n\nDESSERTS: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#Gjihsvgi9ZiLPXzck4F2Ug\n* K\u00fcnefe (2 layers of kadayif, shredded fillo dough, filled w/ sweet cheese, baked. w/ homemade syrup & pistachio nuts, ice cream. $10) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#Zq5OQ_kZrk48lV3j35NP4w\nWow, nice! Intense honey-like flavors. The filo dough ends up being pretty hard, but this comes fresh out of the oven. The ice cream was really sweet and a little icy in texture when it first came out (but I guess it worked out well because it melted quickly with the hot kunefe.\n\nOur receipt: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#lq9nUyxOE9op5EqoabvIJA", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Try the Kuzu Pirzola (Lamp Chops) or Sarma Beyti Kebab or Kuzu Sis...

However, a couple of disappointments led us to a bad experience. Our food came out all at once in tiny small table that could not accommodate all our food.

Given that it was all hot items, we would of enjoyed it if they brought out 2 dishes at a time so we could enjoy it while it was hot, but that was not the case, despite me asking our server if she could possibly not bring it all at once. \"Too late\" was her response. \n\nWe didn't even get to enjoy our hot food since it quickly got cold before we could move on to another dish.

Basically they're made of spicy ground lamb breaded and fried into the shape of a small football. My mouth is watering.\n\nFrom there we moved to the main courses: Hunkar Begendi and Beyti Adana. The first one is unlike anything else we have in America. It's basically mashed potatoes made out of eggplant. I was perplexed. And of course, it's topped with delectable lamb chunks. The second entree was again lamb, wrapped in dough with yogurt and a tomato sauce.\n\nLastly, dessert. Obviously, I was getting pretty full, but if I was gonna go Turkish, I was gonna go big. So for dessert we got Kunefe. I ate it, loved it, and then asked what it was....CHEESE! Baked stringy cheese covered in honey sauce and pistachios.

Piyaz white bean salad with green onions, tomato and tahini vinegar lemon sauce was very nice, but the Ezme crushed walnuts, pepper paste, tomato paste, garlic, cumin was too spicy for my palate. I really, really enjoyed the Haydari fresh dill, mint, thick yogurt, light garlic and wish I could make it myself!\n\nFor our entree, we shared H\u00fcnkar Beendi pureed eggplant with mozzarella cheese topped with lamb cubes.

The Kunefe is layered shredded dough, cheese, pistachio, fried to perfection.  It was sweet, but not over sweat, but has an interesting crusty texture for a dessert.  The biggest draw for the this restaurant was the service.  The host and waitress was very kind and attentive.  They were very nice to us.  I read some recent posting that people were annoyed with the service, but I believe it might have been because of the mass number of people arriving during the final day of Groupon expiration.

I believe food is dynamic and can change, as long as it tastes good or better than the original.  However, I do believe authenticity is important for those who missed the taste of their homeland.  If you are tasting food for childhood memories, they have to be authentic.  My mom used to pay a lot of money for not-so-great tasting desserts and fruit.  When I asked her why she would eat something that doesn't taste good, she said the taste and flavor brings back good memories.  Now that my mother has past away, I long for home cooked meals that reminds me of my mother's cooking more than anything restaurants can dish out.  \n\nTabu is a modern restaurant - whether you go there for authenticity or creativity, you must admit, the food there taste pretty darn good", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-10-29"}, {"excerpts": [", Moussakka was a cheesy casserole, kofte kabab was ho-hum.

It was muggy outside and the heat carried into the restaurant which unsurprisingly does not have AC. SF is not equipped for this kind of weather. It thankfully cooled down as the sun set. \n\nThe flavors of the dishes we had were all delicious but the amount of food felt incredibly small. Portion control, I guess. The service was excellent. The complimentary flatbread they bring out was yummy and perfect for eating with the accompanying seasoned butter, olives, and feta as well as the cold mezes. We also used the bread to pick up the oils from the mezes. The waitress brought us another basket presumably after seeing us wolf down the first plate of bread.     \n\nKIZARTMA (Cold Meze)\nThis appetizer came in two mounds of pan-fried eggplant, bell peppers, and zucchini topped with tomato sauce.

The small scoops left me craving more. \n\nCEVIZLI EZME (Cold Meze)\nA mix of walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin, this  signature meze had incredibly deep flavor. It was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The walnuts added a nice, nutty texture. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this combination of ingredients. I also appreciated the bed of spinach.  \n\nADANA KEBAB\nA succulent kebab of spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers. The meat was very tender and easy to chew.

This experience prompted me to select the sea bream, one of two specials offered us at the outset of a recent dinner at Tuba, not necessarily expecting a mirror recreation of what was made available in Turkey but curious nonetheless what the local chefs might make of the dish. My girlfriend ordered the karniyarik eggplant off of the menu. \n\nAs the food began to arrive the server asked if we intended to share our dishes, which is certainly feasible given the ample portions delivered and perhaps is the answer to one of the few repeated complaints on Yelp (the price per entree, that is). I think the entrees are meant to be shared. If/when we return to Tuba we have decided we will order one entree and augment this with mezzes. I think this will work very well. My sea bream was tasty but I'll likely choose something different next time. Ayran appeared on the drink menu, which thrilled me because we had tried the salted yogurt drink while on holiday and liked it a lot. I had to order it at Tuba, and it tasted very similar, just as refreshing paired with the food. \n\nWe had actually made a reservation for early in the evening, then canceled because we weren't ready to eat yet and ended up going later just ahead of the dinner rush. We had a pokey little table pushed against the wall near the wait station that I was prepared not to enjoy but that turned out fine. The high-backed, cushioned chairs were extremely comfortable and ticked up the enjoyment scale. There appear to be a lot of people on hand to wait on the hungry at this establishment, translating to warm and convivial attention. We got to blab about our visit to Istanbul to a young woman who wasn't even our server but that had approached us anyway. The maitre d'hotel complimented me on the scarf I was wearing, and later held the door open for us to exit. I remember a similar warmth and hospitality extended to us in Istanbul, so experiencing it here was a sort of special confirmation of something that I won't preach about on Yelp. \n\nWhat a nice experience, though.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-13"}, {"excerpts": ["The moussaka, karniyarik (stuffed eggplant), and manti (small meat-stuffed dumplings with yogurt sauce and spices) were all delicious!

Being from Los Angeles myself, I made sure I visited Tuba Restaurant the next time I came to San Francisco. \n\nI called and booked ahead of time. Reserved a table for a party of 9 people. I told them over the phone that I was from Los Angeles and how excited I was about trying their authentic Turkish cuisines. \n\nAt first glance, the restaurant is chic and cozy, on a cute little street. Street parking was hard to find. \n\nOnce we sat down, with my American family, I introduced myself to the server and told them that I am Turkish and that I am very excited to be here. I told them about how much my friends had raved about their food, and thus, I brought my whole American family from San Francisco to try their food. \n\nWe decided to eat family style, with lots of big dishes to share. At first we ordered a bunch of appetizers. \n\nSo here is the part that drops the stars from 5 to 3: \nThe first combo appetizer plate we get, I take a bite off the spinach dip and there is a hair in it! Immediately I spit it out, quietly, and drop it off to the floor so the rest of my party is not grossed out. But I am now very grossed out and dissapointed. \nI then call our server and tell her, quietly, in Turkish, that I got hair in my food. \nShe looks at me in disbelief, and instead of apologizing, grabs my plate and brings me a new one. I decide that I am not going to ruin my whole family's experience so I tell no one. \nAfter all the appetizers are finished and we move on to the entree, the same server comes back and asks how everything was. I tell her the food was good, and then she says, \"well I hope the good food made up for the bad start\".  I tell her \"yes\" and we continue to eat. \n\nWe order: \nappetizer plate\nsigara borek\nseveral plates of lamb, several plates of combination kebabs, \nManti\nTurkish wine, \nVarious deserts: Kunefe, baklava, helva, chocolate pyramid\nTurkish coffee and turkish tea.\n\nOur bill is $500 plus tip.\n\nSo here is my verdict: \n\n1) Although they had charged us 20% gratuity, they never told us so my husband ended up giving them an additional 20% tip on top \n\n2) Even though the food was great, the hair in my food at the very beginning was a big buzz kill. What was even more annoying was at no point did they attempt to apologize about it. She just kind of looked at me in disbelief. What I expected, instead, was for them to apologize and perhaps bring a desert as a gesture for apology. Generally, in such establishments, that is the right thing to do. Especially for a table this big, who just dropped almost $500 for food, the least you could do is take out a desert or two off the bill as a sweet gesture of apology. \n\nYes, the food was good and the ambiance was lovely.

We kind of ate too much of it, honestly, especially once our waiter, Michael, brought out some sort of yoghurty dip and some spicy red stuff.\n\nWe started with crab cakes for me and lentil soup for him. The crab cakes had this awesome consistency, soft and moist with a crunchy crust, and a bonus surprise of toasted pine nuts! What a perfect addition!

Never, during the course of our meal, did we reach for the salt or pepper. Everything was perfectly seasoned. \n\nEntrees. Yes. I had the lamb chops, Boy had the Salmon. Amazing. The salmon was perfectly tender, seasoned but not overly so. It was a great piece of fish, and you could taste it. The seasoning, and the slight bitterness in the rice (bay?) complemented, instead of covering, the taste. The lamb was perfectly cooked, with herbs that combined to make some sort of magical aura around the lamb, but I couldn't identify if you paid me a million dollars, on a bed of the same rice as the salmon, with some awesome kindofmaybe pickled carrots, zucchini and maybe cucumber? Anyway, awesome, and perfect consistency, a slight crunch, but not too much. \n\nDessert! Boy had this incredible pyramid of panna cotta. Something like chocolate, then regular, then dark chocolate? It was some sort of creamy custardy chocolatey thing, then the most perfect panna cotta ever invented. Seriously. The whole thing was shaped into a pyramid, then covered in dark chocolate the Incas and Egyptians would be jealous of, mottled with white chocolate in cute little stripes, then surrounded in (mango? apricot? mangicot?) syrupy-puree stuff that had me literally licking his plate.

Ezme, Manti and irmik helvasi dessert are traditional fare that many places don't offer and those three things were some of the most memorable and tasty eats I had while visiting Turkey. I know everyone thinks kabobs when they think Turkish food but there is so much more to the cuisine than meat on a stick. \n\nThe Ezme was something I had from a street vendor in Istanbul. This was the cart that the locals lined up for. The Ezme paste of crushed walnuts, tomatoes and spices were slathered in a lavash style piece of bread and then whole leaves of romaine lettuce were placed on top and rolled up to be easy to eat as you roamed around the city. At Tuba they present it a bit more elegantly with the paste prettily plopped on a plate and the bread broken into pita chip like pieces to scoop it up with. \n\nThe Manti is similar to beef ravioli but the sauce that tops it is a yogurt/tomato sauce. This is good stuff. The creamy , tangy yogurt sauce is incredibly addicting. It's also pretty to look at with the contrast of white and red swirled together and not completely mixed. \n\nThe irmik helvasi is a semolina flour desert that I stopped a passing boy in the Grand Bazaar to try. In Turkey, the ice cream was encased in the flour mixture but here it's served on the side. The slightly gritty texture of the moist semolina tastes heavenly with the cold smooth accompaniment of ice cream. \n\nTuba restaurant is a great find for authentic Turkish delights here in the states.

How can you go wrong. Other menu standouts I've tried include beyti kebap (kebap wrapped in lavash bread and topped with tomato and yogurt sauce), manti (meat dumplings served in yogurt sauce--I guess I really like my dairy) and Adana kebap. The Adana kebap is different then those I've had elsewhere (and from what I'm told more authentic). The meat had a softer texture and was a lot spicier, so keep that in mind. I find most Turkish food pretty heavy so by the time I'm done with an entree I feel like I'm going to die and therefore too full for dessert. If you don't have that problem I'd suggest the kunefe and or irmik helvasi.\n\nThey have a nice selection of Turkish beers (gotta love Efes Dark) and wines.

"], "author": "Yakamoz S.", "review": "Merhaba Tuba! Welcome to my neighborhood; I've been waiting for you for soooo long!\n\nI can't begin to describe how excited I am about this place. When people ask me what I miss about Turkey (I moved to the US in 1994), my answer  always begins with the same duo: \"I miss the Aegean Sea and I miss the food.\" I always add that I also miss Turkish hospitality. \n\nWell. \n\nThe Aegean Sea remains far away, but Tuba brings to my adopted home, the Mission, both the food and the hospitality that I'd been missing. \n\nReservations (in response to an earlier review): I made reservations on Opentable.com, and upon arriving at the restaurant (a little after 6 pm--I was rushing to get to a show that night), I realized I didn't need to. The place was empty when I arrived. I think more people began coming in around 6:30 or so. By the time I left the restaurant around 7:30 pm, the restaurant was full, but there were still tables available. My suggestion: if you can, use Opentable.com -- it's handy, has an iPhone app, and you get credit the more you use it.  \n\nHospitality: My partner-in-crime wasn't there when I arrived at Tuba, so I stood there for a second, looking at the menu. The owner immediately noticed me and welcomed me in. As soon as I sat down, he asked if I would like some tea or coffee while I waited. We chatted a bit about his restaurant, and because he doesn't have his liquor license yet, he encouraged me to bring my own from the store at the end of the block if I needed some beer or wine with my meal. He mentioned he expects to get his license in the next two weeks (this was about a week ago). He was happy to provide a corkscrew or a bottle opener and glasses for us. Such a warm person. I immediately felt at home in this space, and getting to speak in Turkish with him was an added bonus. \n\nThe food: My ultimate test of authenticity is the dolma. I can walk into a Middle Eastern caf\u00e9, take one look at the dolmas, and be able to tell whether they're from a can or homemade (sorry to say, folks, most of the time, they're from a can). A restaurant, of course, is different. I asked our waiter if they were homemade just in case, and they were...and they were almost as good as grandma's. Almost. My partner-in-crime, who apparently doesn't usually like dolma, ate all of his, so there you go. \n\nThe other appetizers we got were the sigara b\u00f6rek and ezme (the regular kind, not the zucchini kind). The b\u00f6rek was great (careful with your first bite--it's hot!), and the ezme was out of this world. We tried in vain to stop ourselves from spreading the ezme on the delicious pide (not pita) bread so we didn't get too full. \n\nWell, we did get too full, and we weren't so hungry at 6 pm to begin with. Fortunately, we had ordered the mixed grill to share (the one-person version rather than the mixed grill for two). It came with lamb chop (fantastic!), chicken kebab, shish kebab, adana kebab, rice, and veggies (I think I'm forgetting one more kind of kebab on there). It was plenty of food for both of us after all the appetizers, and yet another affirmation that Oh. Yes. I do looooove meat on a skewer. \n\nWith no room for dessert, I had to skip the irmik helvasi that I was looking forward to sampling. Next time! \n\nJust thinking about the menu makes my mouth water. There's so much variety and deliciousness on that menu that I just can't wait to return! \n\nBonus points for Tuba: \n1. As someone who learned English as a second language, and who is now an English teacher, I have an instinctive habit of recognizing typos and grammatical errors on menus, especially when they're not American restaurants. I saw no errors on Tuba's menu. \n2.

I tried a little of the lamb chops from the Mixed Grill which was also very good. I wish you could order an extra serving of rice!\n\nBecause we were celebrating a birthday, they gave us a complimentary dessert, which I believe is the Pyramid noisette chocolate. The only downside about the restaurant was the Chocolate cup creme brulee. We ordered three of them-- two of them were frozen on the inside, and one was soft and melting. We assumed there was something wrong with the melting creme brulee and complained to the waitress. The waitress said that the dessert was supposed to be like that, which meant two out of three of the creme brulees were prepared incorrectly.

Had the lentil soup which was nice. The falafel and hummus plate wasn't as satisfying. My friend didn't like her dish either (meatballs with yogurt)-she thought it also didn't have much taste.\n\nI might return in the future but I think I've tried a lot of their dishes.

Being from Los Angeles myself, I made sure I visited Tuba Restaurant the next time I came to San Francisco. \n\nI called and booked ahead of time. Reserved a table for a party of 9 people. I told them over the phone that I was from Los Angeles and how excited I was about trying their authentic Turkish cuisines. \n\nAt first glance, the restaurant is chic and cozy, on a cute little street. Street parking was hard to find. \n\nOnce we sat down, with my American family, I introduced myself to the server and told them that I am Turkish and that I am very excited to be here. I told them about how much my friends had raved about their food, and thus, I brought my whole American family from San Francisco to try their food. \n\nWe decided to eat family style, with lots of big dishes to share. At first we ordered a bunch of appetizers. \n\nSo here is the part that drops the stars from 5 to 3: \nThe first combo appetizer plate we get, I take a bite off the spinach dip and there is a hair in it! Immediately I spit it out, quietly, and drop it off to the floor so the rest of my party is not grossed out. But I am now very grossed out and dissapointed. \nI then call our server and tell her, quietly, in Turkish, that I got hair in my food. \nShe looks at me in disbelief, and instead of apologizing, grabs my plate and brings me a new one. I decide that I am not going to ruin my whole family's experience so I tell no one. \nAfter all the appetizers are finished and we move on to the entree, the same server comes back and asks how everything was. I tell her the food was good, and then she says, \"well I hope the good food made up for the bad start\".  I tell her \"yes\" and we continue to eat. \n\nWe order: \nappetizer plate\nsigara borek\nseveral plates of lamb, several plates of combination kebabs, \nManti\nTurkish wine, \nVarious deserts: Kunefe, baklava, helva, chocolate pyramid\nTurkish coffee and turkish tea.\n\nOur bill is $500 plus tip.\n\nSo here is my verdict: \n\n1) Although they had charged us 20% gratuity, they never told us so my husband ended up giving them an additional 20% tip on top \n\n2) Even though the food was great, the hair in my food at the very beginning was a big buzz kill. What was even more annoying was at no point did they attempt to apologize about it. She just kind of looked at me in disbelief. What I expected, instead, was for them to apologize and perhaps bring a desert as a gesture for apology. Generally, in such establishments, that is the right thing to do. Especially for a table this big, who just dropped almost $500 for food, the least you could do is take out a desert or two off the bill as a sweet gesture of apology. \n\nYes, the food was good and the ambiance was lovely.

It was a generous portion.\n\nMant\u0131 - Dumplings stuffed with ground beef, topped with garlic yogurt sauce,\npepper flakes and dried mint. The dumpling were tiny! They were bite-sized! But the meat within was very fresh. The ground beef was a tad bit dry, however, it didn't both us because it paired well with the the sauce as well. \n\nBread and water were refilled without request. We were able to eat the bread with the yogurt sauce as well!\n\nAt the end, we were stuffed but we HAD to order Pyramid Noisette Chocolate to satisfy my sweet cravings and 2 orders of the Turkish coffee.

The lamb was perfectly cooked, with herbs that combined to make some sort of magical aura around the lamb, but I couldn't identify if you paid me a million dollars, on a bed of the same rice as the salmon, with some awesome kindofmaybe pickled carrots, zucchini and maybe cucumber? Anyway, awesome, and perfect consistency, a slight crunch, but not too much. \n\nDessert! Boy had this incredible pyramid of panna cotta. Something like chocolate, then regular, then dark chocolate? It was some sort of creamy custardy chocolatey thing, then the most perfect panna cotta ever invented. Seriously. The whole thing was shaped into a pyramid, then covered in dark chocolate the Incas and Egyptians would be jealous of, mottled with white chocolate in cute little stripes, then surrounded in (mango? apricot? mangicot?) syrupy-puree stuff that had me literally licking his plate. When he wasn't looking. Because he's embarrassed by me sometimes. I had the house specialty, a (guys, I loved it so much I copied from the menu and emailed it to my mother with a picture) \"Kunefe: Two layers of kadayif (shredded fillo dough) filled with sweet cheese, baked to perfection, and served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts\" Salty-sweet, warm in the middle with a cool syrup, crunchy and delicious, I can see why it was the house special. I can't wait to go back and try the other one I couldn't pronounce. \n\nBoth of us had Turkish Coffee with dessert, which explains why I'm in Shotwell's Bar at 11:50 pm buzzing and drinking red wine and writing this review. OMGWHOAGUYS\n\n\nAnyway, highly recommended, a great asset to that block, which already has some excellent businesses (Tao is amazing, people.

Service from start to finish was efficient and very personable and seemed to be quick without making us feel rushed. We got to sample a few by-the-glass wines before making our decision. They brought out warm flat bread with olives, feta and humus. Very yummy. We had the crab cake appetizer which was delicious. Very crabby (in a good way) and nice crisp crust on the outside (made with bulgar, I think). My entree was the beef manti. Loved the dainty little pockets and the sauce was just great. Hubby had the chicken shishkabobs which can be the epitome of sameness. This was just great. The meat was tender and flavorful. Loved the grilled veggies with it. The sole reason we picked this restaurant was to satisfy my craving for kunafe. I've had kunafe at a few other spots in the city, but this one was my favorite so far.

Being from Los Angeles myself, I made sure I visited Tuba Restaurant the next time I came to San Francisco. \n\nI called and booked ahead of time. Reserved a table for a party of 9 people. I told them over the phone that I was from Los Angeles and how excited I was about trying their authentic Turkish cuisines. \n\nAt first glance, the restaurant is chic and cozy, on a cute little street. Street parking was hard to find. \n\nOnce we sat down, with my American family, I introduced myself to the server and told them that I am Turkish and that I am very excited to be here. I told them about how much my friends had raved about their food, and thus, I brought my whole American family from San Francisco to try their food. \n\nWe decided to eat family style, with lots of big dishes to share. At first we ordered a bunch of appetizers. \n\nSo here is the part that drops the stars from 5 to 3: \nThe first combo appetizer plate we get, I take a bite off the spinach dip and there is a hair in it! Immediately I spit it out, quietly, and drop it off to the floor so the rest of my party is not grossed out. But I am now very grossed out and dissapointed. \nI then call our server and tell her, quietly, in Turkish, that I got hair in my food. \nShe looks at me in disbelief, and instead of apologizing, grabs my plate and brings me a new one. I decide that I am not going to ruin my whole family's experience so I tell no one. \nAfter all the appetizers are finished and we move on to the entree, the same server comes back and asks how everything was. I tell her the food was good, and then she says, \"well I hope the good food made up for the bad start\".  I tell her \"yes\" and we continue to eat. \n\nWe order: \nappetizer plate\nsigara borek\nseveral plates of lamb, several plates of combination kebabs, \nManti\nTurkish wine, \nVarious deserts: Kunefe, baklava, helva, chocolate pyramid\nTurkish coffee and turkish tea.\n\nOur bill is $500 plus tip.\n\nSo here is my verdict: \n\n1) Although they had charged us 20% gratuity, they never told us so my husband ended up giving them an additional 20% tip on top \n\n2) Even though the food was great, the hair in my food at the very beginning was a big buzz kill. What was even more annoying was at no point did they attempt to apologize about it. She just kind of looked at me in disbelief. What I expected, instead, was for them to apologize and perhaps bring a desert as a gesture for apology. Generally, in such establishments, that is the right thing to do. Especially for a table this big, who just dropped almost $500 for food, the least you could do is take out a desert or two off the bill as a sweet gesture of apology. \n\nYes, the food was good and the ambiance was lovely.

It was Turkish and it is said to be authentic according to its description. Tracy A came here and wrote a nice review on Yelp. I tend to follow her around these days - perhaps our dining choices are starting to collide. \n\nG promptly guided me to another spot. He was way off. I should never trusted his sense of direction. We arrived 15 minutes later than expected but it was still early and they gladly took our call and said that the table was waiting for us. Nice!\n\nIncoming the free and tasty warm house made bread with three dipping sauces. The one thing I did not like Seattle eating scene is that they charge you for the bread, even those terrible ones that I won't even feed the pigeons with. I don't understand it. I like a place that makes yummy authentic Turkish bread and serve them with three kind of dipping sauces. All free of charge. And they did refill and the refill was a basket of warmer breads. Can I just eat that instead? \n\nOf course not. Ordered their signature cold meze which is called Cevizli Ezme. It's a big portion and very flavorful. Then for a hot meze we did \u0130\u00e7li K\u00f6fte. It's impossible to pronounce so of course it's deliciously foreign and exotic. Stayed away from the salad based off Tracy's review.

Superb.\n\nG is an excellent runner. I often get my running tips from him. We also are friends and we took the opportunity to catch up: I updated him on the revolving door part of my life (because the rest of my life is insanely boring), and he debriefed me on his comings and goings. We concluded that I must lay off running until I'm all healed fro the annoying back injury. I sort of want to kick him because what am I if I'm not a runner any more? The meaning of life is contemplated over a cup of warm Turkish tea. \n\nDark no-running cloud hovering my heart. Just then, he said, when you get better, we should try that Egyptian place in Outer Richmond. \"Remember that place?\" Yes indeed. We ate dinner after running once by there.

In fact, we found street parking within two blocks. Ambiance: warm and welcoming. Service: impeccable. They cleared our silverware midway and wiped our table before dessert.  Dishes: we ordered ezme (crushed walnuts, pepper paste, etc.), lentil soup, moussaka, beyti adana (grilled lamb wrapped in lavash with yogurt and grilled pepper), and for dessert, kiinefe (delicious), Turkish coffee, and Turkish tea.  Each dish was well prepared and attractively presented.  The complimentary bread was served warm with  spicy butter/olives/feta cheese. We loved the decor of deep red walls, hanging lights, splashy abstract paintings, and unusually colorful salt and pepper shakers.

My number one love and activity there has been the food.  \n\nI really wanted to love this place, but it is unfair for me to expect what you would experience food-wise in Turkey here in San Francisco, but I can't help to compare.  All things considered, I thought the food at Tuba was good, the service very good.\n\nI was so excited to try this place and never would have known about it had I not seen their Groupon offer (thank you for offering up one as adding incentive to try and making your presence know in SF).  The name doesn't exactly imply Turkish, so never would have known.  I've walked by this place a few times in the past and had no idea.  I'm always on the lookout for Turkish restaurants, especially with menus that go beyond kebap and baklava.  Tuba certainly does.\n\nThe front of house staff were super friendly and accommodating.  We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed, but they were able to seat us anyway.  We had a few appetizers, entree, and desert.\n\nFood-wise, the highlight was the Kunefe with a little tea (in the little curvy Turkish tea glasses at that) to wash it down.  I never had Kunefe like this in Turkey.  The Tuba version had generous amount of cheese filling really made it stand out.\n\nOverall, yes this place is worth a try, the food is good, service friendly, ambiance ok, but if you have experienced Turkish food in Turkey and are expecting the same, you may be a little disappointed.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-08-06"}]}
