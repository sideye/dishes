Pretty simple: shredded cabbage and carrots, but the dipping sauce (a sweet chili sauce?) was amazing.  For an entree, I ordered the Sesame Meatless Chicken with Broccoli, which was so yum. My boyfriend had the Kung Pao Meatless Prawns, which was also very good. It came with lots of sauteed veggies (peppers and onions) in a light sauce. The meatless prawns looked like actual prawns, which always freaks me out since I've never eaten seafood, but they were really good nonetheless. I'm really impressed that this restaurant decided to offer something other than tofu or meatless chicken. \n\nI don't think they have any vegan options for dessert, but you do get unlimited hot tea with your meal, which was a nice bonus.\n\nI definitely plan to go back soon, and when I do, I think I'm going for the General Tso or the Lemon Meatless Chicken.

This restaurant is a paradigm example of one of those hole-in- the-wall restaurants dispersed throughout SF. This genre of owners have other passions in life besides unscrupulously operating their businesses to maximize profits and $$$$. I believe when one operates a business out of passion and in pursuit of other dreams in life, the products and services are always exceptionally remarkable. Kung Food is clearly different from large chain restaurants that only want your $$$$.\n\nOnce in a rare blue moon, I experienced the warmth of dining as a welcomed and cherished patron.

You get an entree with a side of steamed white rice or for an extra dollar you can opt for egg fried rice, veggie chow mein, or brown rice. Soup and an egg roll are also included for free. All of this for $8.50. \n\nEntrees that I've tried here thus far:\n\nMongolian Beef - tender slices of beef saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers and green onions along with whole red chili peppers. This dish is especially good because the sauce is not overpowering and the meat is cooked to perfection. The veggies are not served limp, and they remain crisp and light with every bite. \n\nCurry Chicken - I ordered this as spicy, and it came out surprisingly balanced. The cuts of chicken were moist and the curry flavor was prominent without being overwhelming. \n\nHoney Walnut Prawns - These babies are so juicy and plump, they pop in your mouth. The sauce is creamy, slightly sweet, and savory, yet not heavily doused in oil. The candied walnuts dusted with sesame seeds played a supportive role in rounding out this dish. \n\nOrange Chicken - Citrusy with a hint of tangy and a touch of sweetness, I was relieved to see that this common dish was not over-fried and dry.  \n\nKung Food promises outstanding Chinese cuisine, excellent service, and friendly staff; all of which I have personally experienced and can vouch for. \n\nWhen it comes to cheap, Chinese takeout, I thing Kung Food is definitely a game changer in the definition of how this food can be perceived. \n\n5 Stars!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The walnut prawns was not bad.

And you thought that I rely heavily on a burrito and an Oscar Mayer bologna sandwich (not all on one serving) for lunch!?! \n\nI was here last month and twice within a week, both times checking out the lunch specials.  The lunch specials range from $7.50-$9.95. My first visit, I was hungry and ordered the Mongolian lamb over rice. For $9.95, the spicy dish has lean and grilled lamb meat, spicy peppers, onions and extra heat. Every lunch specials comes with a complimentary egg roll. You can also choose white rice, brown or fried rice, both at extra cost.   I like any spicy Mongolian rice dishes, the restaurant's version is very good with the grilled lamb a difference maker. This dish is classified as spicy, but this dish is tolerable for wimps. \n\nI also ordered a side of chicken wings. The chicken wings were just okay with overly excessive amount of batter. Plus, it was an overkill with the hefty and large rice plate. They say, \"my eyes are bigger than my stomach\" It definitely shows. But I struggled and finished both dishes anyway. \n\nMy second visit came a few days later. I ordered Dragon beef over rice. For $8.95, the beef was slightly fried with a hint of Hunan-blended spices. The dish is very mild with a tangy taste of Hunan flavor. I also like this dish too. \n\nThe restaurant is really small and is located on the McAllister street side and not the busy Divisadero corridor side.

All of this for $8.50. \n\nEntrees that I've tried here thus far:\n\nMongolian Beef - tender slices of beef saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers and green onions along with whole red chili peppers. This dish is especially good because the sauce is not overpowering and the meat is cooked to perfection. The veggies are not served limp, and they remain crisp and light with every bite. \n\nCurry Chicken - I ordered this as spicy, and it came out surprisingly balanced. The cuts of chicken were moist and the curry flavor was prominent without being overwhelming. \n\nHoney Walnut Prawns - These babies are so juicy and plump, they pop in your mouth. The sauce is creamy, slightly sweet, and savory, yet not heavily doused in oil. The candied walnuts dusted with sesame seeds played a supportive role in rounding out this dish. \n\nOrange Chicken - Citrusy with a hint of tangy and a touch of sweetness, I was relieved to see that this common dish was not over-fried and dry.  \n\nKung Food promises outstanding Chinese cuisine, excellent service, and friendly staff; all of which I have personally experienced and can vouch for. \n\nWhen it comes to cheap, Chinese takeout, I thing Kung Food is definitely a game changer in the definition of how this food can be perceived. \n\n5 Stars!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Korean fried chicken lunch meal and it came with white rice, hot & sour soup and egg roll.

The delivery was fast and the food was hot.  However, the dumplings were not tasty, they were doughy and bland.  The soup had a bit too much sour and not enough hot while the fried rice was dry and missing a lacking  in egg, vegetables and pork.  Skimpy comes to mind.
