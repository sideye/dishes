After all, we like Thai food, and we pass by it every time we're on Castro, or at least we pass by the sign since you can't really see the restaurant from street level. It's upstairs on the second floor of a Victorian where the windows face the neon marquee of the Castro Theater (photo: http://bit.ly/1bQis8o). There are also two other so-so Thai places in the Castro where you don't have to climb stairs to get to them. Maybe we've concluded so-so Thai is better than a potential groin injury on those stairs. Now I'm just making up excuses, but we finally made it.\n\nYes, we tried Thailand, and I have to say that satisfying Thai food continues to be an elusive search in the Castro. We started on a misstep because we didn't read the descriptions carefully enough. We thought we ordered true Spring Rolls when we asked for the $6.95 Thailand Rolls, but it turned out to be fried ones, and it turned out to be two dollars extra for \"Fresh\" Spring Rolls. Even though they were decent enough, it was a bummer since I didn't want to have an oily crunch in my mouth when I wasn't prepared for it (photo: http://bit.ly/1yDshLN).  Jamie was more forgiving, and he segued into the $8.95 Chicken Noodles.\n\nIt was a rather bland plate of pan-fried noodles sauteed with chicken, egg, bean sprouts, onions and ground peanuts (photo: http://bit.ly/1GNZHOX). I decided to get into a more vegetarian mode with the $8.50 Pad Ma Keau, a full plate of sauteed eggplant mixed in black bean sauce, garlic and basil (photo: http://bit.ly/1CzIaXI). It was tasty enough for me but still lacked a certain oomph to make it completely winning. Weak menu choices? Perhaps but even a base hit among the three dishes would have been nice. Couple that with the rather passive service, and it made for an evening infused with a pervasive mehness despite the passing quality of the food that was served. So down the stairs we go.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Thai dishes make the journey to the top of the stairs a fitful one\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a bit like someone's living room converted to a restaurant, for better or worse\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...not sure if they were trying to be unobtrusive but it came across as a bit passive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...don't expect a stairway to heaven", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-04-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Thailand Rolls (Spring Rolls).

After all, we like Thai food, and we pass by it every time we're on Castro, or at least we pass by the sign since you can't really see the restaurant from street level. It's upstairs on the second floor of a Victorian where the windows face the neon marquee of the Castro Theater (photo: http://bit.ly/1bQis8o).

Now I'm just making up excuses, but we finally made it.\n\nYes, we tried Thailand, and I have to say that satisfying Thai food continues to be an elusive search in the Castro. We started on a misstep because we didn't read the descriptions carefully enough. We thought we ordered true Spring Rolls when we asked for the $6.95 Thailand Rolls, but it turned out to be fried ones, and it turned out to be two dollars extra for \"Fresh\" Spring Rolls. Even though they were decent enough, it was a bummer since I didn't want to have an oily crunch in my mouth when I wasn't prepared for it (photo: http://bit.ly/1yDshLN).  Jamie was more forgiving, and he segued into the $8.95 Chicken Noodles.\n\nIt was a rather bland plate of pan-fried noodles sauteed with chicken, egg, bean sprouts, onions and ground peanuts (photo: http://bit.ly/1GNZHOX). I decided to get into a more vegetarian mode with the $8.50 Pad Ma Keau, a full plate of sauteed eggplant mixed in black bean sauce, garlic and basil (photo: http://bit.ly/1CzIaXI). It was tasty enough for me but still lacked a certain oomph to make it completely winning. Weak menu choices? Perhaps but even a base hit among the three dishes would have been nice.

Despite asking to make it highest level of hot flavor, dishes were extremely sweet, almost inedible. Whenever we asked for something, like chopsticks and hot sauce, the server looked extremely surprised and had a very unwilling to serve attitude.

I stopped here with my friend after a yoga class. It was about 9:40 and they close at 10. It was her birthday and I was really excited to take her out. As soon as we got there, the host said abruptly we could only order take out and we couldn't eat there since the restaurant is closing.\n\nFrom experience, usually you do allow guests to still seat 20 minutes before closing and if you can't, then you usually say something like, \"Hi guys, we're really sorry but the best we can do is provide take out because the restaurant is closing soon. Is this okay with you?\" We decided to do takeout anyway. Strike 1.\n\nFive minutes into looking at the menu, the host then says, \"I don't want to be rude but the kitchen is closing soon so you need to order!\" Again, a better approach might be, \"Hi guys, our kitchen is closing soon and I want to get your order in before it does. I have some great recommendations if you are having trouble deciding. Is there anything I can help with?\" Strike 2.\n\nWe rush our order and I hand the host my American Express. He glances at it haughtily, hands it back and says, we don't take American Express. Do you have something else. Exasperated by my whole experience in the course of 5 minutes, I replied this is kind of ridiculous. He looked up, glared at me said you have a bad attitude. He cancels our order and then kicks us out of the restaurant making snide remarks as we leave.\n\nLook, I know the restaurant industry is stressful - I've lived it.

The rest of the dishes also lacked the traditional palate of Thai spices, making them mediocre at best. \n\nThe spicy dishes were only hot from the sliced raw jalapenos that were added. They did not even use Thai peppers/chilis. The shrimp tasted like pre-cooked frozen shrimp that had just been thawed and tossed into the wok last minute making them very bland. No searing of any kind could be seen on the shrimp or veggies. I have definitely made much more flavorful and authentic tasting Thai food at home just by using Thai curry paste and coconut milk!\n\nAnother disappointment was the lack of rice options.  Brown or Jasmine only, no sticky or coconut rice. \n\nIf I were only reviewing the food I would give Thailand Restaurant 2 stars since the food didn't necessarily taste horrible, but it paled in comparison to other Thai food I have had.

The scoop of rice was less than the size of my palm (very small indeed) and came in a little soap dish holder size rice plate. The duck curry came in a long dish, but very few pieces of duck and 4 pieces of pineapple. I have to give credit to the place for their saucing as it was pretty good- not too salty or spicy. It suited my taste buds well, but I was very VERY disappointed in the duck. I probably got a total of 5 actual pieces of duck and even within those pieces (about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide), half of it was seriously fat. Cmon now! I've never had duck in the bay area with that much fat. The duck wasn't very lean. True, sauce was great, but fatty duck doesn't make a girl happy. Then came the dessert I ordered because I wasn't full off the 5 pieces of duck and 4 pineapple slices. I ordered the roti (think Southeast Asian style \"bread\"/fried with condensed milk) for $3.00. I got it with the condensed milk on top of the \"bread\". I thought it was okay though it's hard to go wrong by pouring condense milk onto something like fried \"bread\". All together, my meal totaled $18.00 including a 15% ish tip. \n\nAmbiance: Credit for the restaurant for keeping part of the Victorian style facade and for not over decorating. During half way through my dinner, the waiter came by and placed a light candle on my table.

I liked it! The iced tea was better too. And, even though it was late, we weren't rushed out. b liked his soup too. My other roomie n likes this place too, so now that I know what I should order when I come here, its good, and I would come back again. so the moral of this story is, if you don't like this place the first time, give it a 2nd try. If you still don't like it, maybe you just don't like it.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-03-03"}], "fresh young coconut juice": [], "thai ice coffee": [], "regular ice tea": [], "thailand hot tea": [], "hot green tea": [], "sprite": []}
