We've passed by this ristorante in the past without giving it a thought, but the thought of a plate of pasta sounded just right for Sunday supper. Fortunately it wasn't very crowded at about 7:30PM, and we got a table right away surrounded by bottles of wine on their dining room divider (photo: http://bit.ly/2gA2x5s). The menu was chock full of items that sounded like comfort food for paisans like us. OK, we're not real paisans, but you know what I mean.\n\nWe were first handed quite a bread plate with huge slices of rustic goodness accompanied by a creamy tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2gc49z7). We tried to control ourselves for the carbs to come but to little avail. The Bruschetta seemed a tad pricey at $9.50, but we understood why the moment it arrived. The toasted and buttered garlic bread slices were as big as rice paddles and topped with Kalamata olives. Two were piled high with fresh tomatoes and basil in the traditional way, and the other two were spread with pesto and piled high with sliced mushrooms marinated in olive oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2gtSJcx). Really delicious, especially the unexpected mushroom bruschetta, and their abundance made us second-guess our soon-to-arrive entrees.\n\nJamie went for a pizza as is his natural want, and it was the $16.95 Pizza Capriciossa topped with prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms, mozzarella, and just a smidgen of tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2fiBSYd). All the ingredients were tasty, and the crust was not too bready. However, a bigger ladle of tomato sauce would have been welcome to lubricate the gullet as it went down. I was in a seafood mood, so I ordered the $16.95 Spaghetti Alla Vongole, a heaping plate of thick spaghetti pasta with fresh clams, garlic, white wine, chili pepper flakes, all of it in a light tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2fJsXzW). It was frankly just what I wanted even if it wasn't a culinary masterpiece. Neither of us could finish our entrees, so we had enough for our respective lunches at work the following day.

And every time I visit they live up to their elevated level of quality, decadence and service. \n\nRecently they have added house made breadsticks to their welcoming bread sampler accompanied by their unique tapenade. The breadsticks aren't Olive Garden-esque doughy, nasty breadsticks but also aren't a traditional hard as a rock, pretzel-like breadstick. They're a slightly crispy well seasoned addition to their happy welcome. \n\nCannot say enough tremendous things about their specials menu. It's quite large without being overwhelming with too many options. And it changes seasonally which is the mark of a restaurant on top of utilizing the best ingredients available per time of year. \n\nOne of my favorite dishes is the cold seafood salad. The seafood is precisely cooked to maximize the fresh seafood flavor without being too robust or fishy. It's well dressed with a mustard, garlicky based sauce and pairs well with the bruschetta. \n\nThe Eggplant Parmesan is stacked with such grace and elegance that one would think the chef graduated from MIT. Not overloaded with marinara sauce and cheese, it allows the eggplant to breath and sing into the mouths of its diners. \n\nThe aspect I appreciate the most of Spiazzo is the ideology that the customer should be pleased with everything they order. If you request extra sauce, additional meats, no meat, extra cheese, pink sauce - even if it's not on the menu, they make it happen. The servers treat you like royalty and don't give you a nasty look if you ask for something outside of the normal realm of spaghetti and meatballs.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-11-09"}, {"excerpts": ["but I get with spaghetti noodles), penne al salmone, lasagna, bruschetta (mushrooms and tomatoes), insalata con pere (pear and gorgonzola salad), creme brulee, grilled salmon, calamari appetizer with arabiatta sauce, shrimp scampi, as well as goat cheese with eggplant appetizer.\n\n"], "author": "Vicki G.", "review": "I have been going to spiazzo for 19 years now.

Who knew Spiazzo was just one of a couple of places that could fit the bill?\n\nWalking in, I liked the feel of the restaurant - a little nicer than other casual, Italian joints but with a relaxed, neighborhood type of vibe.  We were able to snag the last free table, and I was moderately impressed with the assortment of dishes the menu had to offer.  I ordered the Minestrone and Spaghetti Portofino, and I was able to try the Beef Carpaccio my friend ordered for the table.\n\n- Minestrone (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NWu1cDtYArkjWw2F8PzU9Q?select=obS63fHpNd1fFiUVVaeRZg) - the portion was larger than I expected, but that's about it.

I didn't like the prawns, but the scallops were okay and I liked the sauce.\n\nEven though I don't usually care about the bread a restaurant serves, Spiazzo's seemed a little weird.  Typically, fresh bread has a soft and fluffy core, but this one was dense and \"chunky\" (no other way to describe it).  Also, the service left me a little mixed - \"cold but efficient\" as my friend described.  Our waiter wasn't that friendly and didn't say more than he needed to, but he didn't mess up and was pretty quick.  Hard to complain when he didn't make a mistake.\n\nEven though it didn't really bowl me over, I can see why people might like Spiazzo.

I enjoyed the burrata and prosciutto. The burrata was creamy while the prosciutto added a nice meaty saltiness. I adore anchovies so I ordered the caesar. It satisfied my veggie craving, but it was over dressed. I also could have used more anchovies! The pizza was a nice way to try a couple different pies, but it seemed like it was only a half and half versus a sampling of three pizzas. I thought the calamari was average.

If you want gourmet Italian food in an unrushed, romantic atmosphere, go somewhere else. If you want unpretentious food in generous proportions at reasonable prices served promptly, Spiazzo will fill the bill. \n\nThis restaurant is very popular with moviegoers (Cinearts at Empire is just down the street), and is always packed and noisy on weekends. You'll have a better experience if you can come on a weekday, when the pace is more leisurely and you might have a chance at getting one of their comfortable upholstered booths. Service here has always been very good. The servers are friendly and efficient.\n \nI recommend the following dishes, which have been consistently good over the years: Minestrone (vegetarian), Spaghetti Bolognese (the best I've ever had), Salmon Fantasia, Spaghetti Calabrese (vegetarian), Pollo Piccatina, Chicken Marsala, the grilled Pork Loin and the Pizza Vegetale (If you are a vegan, they'll gladly omit the cheese).  All the pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven. Occasionally on the specials menu they offer Pappardelle with Lamb Sauce. Don't miss this dish; it's heaven on a plate!\n\nUnless you like tart flavors, I would avoid the fish dishes that are prepared with lemon sauce and capers or artichokes. The kitchen tends to go a little too heavy on the lemon for my taste. I also don't care for the fish dishes that are prepared with spicy tomato sauce; the strong flavor of the sauce overwhelms the delicate taste of fish, and it's tough to find a good wine pairing. \n\nSome have complained about the Caesar Salad, but I happen to like it. It's a bit small and unpretentious, but has a pleasantly tangy dressing (and no anchovies). Even better is the more generously-sized Insalata Etrusca, with marinated white beans, shaved parmesan and fennel on a bed of mixed greens with a tart balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend the sinfully delicious house-made tiramisu or the chocolate pot de creme. I also like the chocolate brownie cake, the spumoni cake and chocolate-dipped biscotti. The cannoli is OK, but it's imported frozen from Italy so it doesn't taste as fresh as a locally-made product.\n\nIn 20 years, I've only had to send one dish back -- a fish dish that had an oily \"off\" taste. The waiter said it was fresh, and I believe him, but it just didn't taste right. No problem, no attitude, they were happy to prepare a different entree for me.\n\nFor those who say they've had a bad experience at Spiazzo, all I can say is that either you are awfully hard to please or you must have been there on a rare off night.

We were seated around 7:20pm.\n\n*Burrata E Prosciutto: fresh mozzarella shell and stracciatella, with 12 months aged prosciutto and kalamata olives + EVOO ($16.95) x2\n*Fried Calamari: calamari, baby shrimps, zucchini deep fried with arrabiata sauce, spicy ($18.95) x2\n*Insalata Alla Cesare: caesar salad ($8), add Anchovies (+$3.50)\n*Pizza Tricolore: 1/3 Margherita with fresh tomato and basil, 1/3 Four cheeses, and 1/3 Pesto and Mozzarella ($16.95)\n*Sangiovese Pasqua ($34)\n*Barbera d'Asti ($36)\n\nWe all shared appetizers and wine. I enjoyed the burrata and prosciutto. The burrata was creamy while the prosciutto added a nice meaty saltiness. I adore anchovies so I ordered the caesar. It satisfied my veggie craving, but it was over dressed. I also could have used more anchovies! The pizza was a nice way to try a couple different pies, but it seemed like it was only a half and half versus a sampling of three pizzas. I thought the calamari was average. It was a pretty big portion though. The wines were moderately priced. I liked that we could get decent reds for under $40 a bottle.\n\n*Gnocchi Romoletto: italian potato dumplings with fresh tomato, basil, mushrooms and secret spices of the chef ($16.95)\n*Spaghetti Alla Vongole: spaghetti with fresh clams, garlic, white wine, a touch of chili peppers in a tomato sauce ($17.95) x2\n*Spaghetti Portofino: spaghetti, prawns, scallions, white wine + garlic sauce ($19.95)\n*Fettuccine Con Gamberoni: egg fettuccine, fresh tomato, garlic, a touch of chili pepper, white wine, basil, prawns and green onions ($17.95)\n*Ravioli Con Pesto E Pollo: large ravioli, pesto and chicken filled, in a light cream sauce, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach ($19.95)\n*Filetto Alla Dolce Vita: grilled grass fed filet mignon with mushrooms, prosciutto in a marsala wine sauce ($27.95)\n*Garretto Romanesco: braised lamb shank with mushrooms and green peas in a tomato wine sauce served with risotto ($26.95)\n\nI ordered the filet since I'm a big meat eater. It was cooked rare and I adored the mushrooms, but it was a little too sweet for me. And the prosciutto didn't seem to go with the wine sauce. I'm not a big pasta eater, but hands down, my favorite dish was the ravioli. So creamy and comforting. Mushrooms and spinach are two of my favorite vegetables, so I adored them in this dish!\n\n*Tiramisu ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7.50)\n*Zanze's Cheese Cake ($7.50)\n*Graham's Tawny Port n/v ($7.95) x2\n*Graham's 20 Years ($12)\n*Harveys Bristol Cream n/v ($7.95)\n*Vin Santo di Toscana ($12.95)\n*Coffee \u00d73\n\nBirthday celebrations always ended with dessert and drinks.

Being the geniuses that we are, no one thought about making reservations for a party of 5 at 7pm on a weekday. Thankfully, the restaurant was not full (usually a bad sign...) and we were seated immediately by a lovely waitress that was very accommodating. Not only did we not make reservations, we had the nerve to bring in a birthday cake and requested them to store it for us while we surprised our friend who worked across the street. I must give them high praises for their friendliness and high-quality customer service.\n\nAfter a terrible attempt at ambushing our friend, we brought him over to Spiazzo and were again warmly greeted. A charming, older Italian gentleman handed menus to us and made suggestions. From the vibe that I got, he is either the manager or the owner.\n\nWe ordered the Penne Al Salmone, Fussilli Allas Genovese, Spaghetti Portofino, Pizza Tricolore, and Pizza Spiazzo.

There was a good amount of salmon in the Penne Al Salmone but it was strange to see the salmon flaked and mixed with the pasta, instead of being served as a whole salmon fillet or even chunks.

There was the perfect amount of cheese and the various toppings added the perfect amount of texture and savoriness to the lovely sauce and melty mozzarella.\n\nAfter we finished the dishes (or rather, the ladies at the table packed their half-finished meals in take-home boxes), we asked the nice Italian gentleman to bring out the cake. As sweet as can be, he brought out the cake and some plates and silverware. Then, he led us in a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday. However he threw us a curveball and began to sing in Italian. It was extremely charming and endearing. I wish he was my uncle, but I will avoid my uncle issues in this post... To make things even better, when the bill came, we were surprisingly not charged a cake-cutting fee, as is standard at most other institutions. We felt obliged to tip generously and thank him profusely. \n\nBottom line, the food was good and the service was amazing. If the dishes were lighter and the pizza was more spectacular, it would be receiving five stars from me.\n\nThank you, old nameless Italian gentleman.

If you want unpretentious food in generous proportions at reasonable prices served promptly, Spiazzo will fill the bill. \n\nThis restaurant is very popular with moviegoers (Cinearts at Empire is just down the street), and is always packed and noisy on weekends. You'll have a better experience if you can come on a weekday, when the pace is more leisurely and you might have a chance at getting one of their comfortable upholstered booths. Service here has always been very good. The servers are friendly and efficient.\n \nI recommend the following dishes, which have been consistently good over the years: Minestrone (vegetarian), Spaghetti Bolognese (the best I've ever had), Salmon Fantasia, Spaghetti Calabrese (vegetarian), Pollo Piccatina, Chicken Marsala, the grilled Pork Loin and the Pizza Vegetale (If you are a vegan, they'll gladly omit the cheese).  All the pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven. Occasionally on the specials menu they offer Pappardelle with Lamb Sauce. Don't miss this dish; it's heaven on a plate!\n\nUnless you like tart flavors, I would avoid the fish dishes that are prepared with lemon sauce and capers or artichokes. The kitchen tends to go a little too heavy on the lemon for my taste. I also don't care for the fish dishes that are prepared with spicy tomato sauce; the strong flavor of the sauce overwhelms the delicate taste of fish, and it's tough to find a good wine pairing. \n\nSome have complained about the Caesar Salad, but I happen to like it. It's a bit small and unpretentious, but has a pleasantly tangy dressing (and no anchovies). Even better is the more generously-sized Insalata Etrusca, with marinated white beans, shaved parmesan and fennel on a bed of mixed greens with a tart balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend the sinfully delicious house-made tiramisu or the chocolate pot de creme. I also like the chocolate brownie cake, the spumoni cake and chocolate-dipped biscotti. The cannoli is OK, but it's imported frozen from Italy so it doesn't taste as fresh as a locally-made product.\n\nIn 20 years, I've only had to send one dish back -- a fish dish that had an oily \"off\" taste. The waiter said it was fresh, and I believe him, but it just didn't taste right. No problem, no attitude, they were happy to prepare a different entree for me.\n\nFor those who say they've had a bad experience at Spiazzo, all I can say is that either you are awfully hard to please or you must have been there on a rare off night.

If you want unpretentious food in generous proportions at reasonable prices served promptly, Spiazzo will fill the bill. \n\nThis restaurant is very popular with moviegoers (Cinearts at Empire is just down the street), and is always packed and noisy on weekends. You'll have a better experience if you can come on a weekday, when the pace is more leisurely and you might have a chance at getting one of their comfortable upholstered booths. Service here has always been very good. The servers are friendly and efficient.\n \nI recommend the following dishes, which have been consistently good over the years: Minestrone (vegetarian), Spaghetti Bolognese (the best I've ever had), Salmon Fantasia, Spaghetti Calabrese (vegetarian), Pollo Piccatina, Chicken Marsala, the grilled Pork Loin and the Pizza Vegetale (If you are a vegan, they'll gladly omit the cheese).  All the pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven. Occasionally on the specials menu they offer Pappardelle with Lamb Sauce. Don't miss this dish; it's heaven on a plate!\n\nUnless you like tart flavors, I would avoid the fish dishes that are prepared with lemon sauce and capers or artichokes. The kitchen tends to go a little too heavy on the lemon for my taste. I also don't care for the fish dishes that are prepared with spicy tomato sauce; the strong flavor of the sauce overwhelms the delicate taste of fish, and it's tough to find a good wine pairing. \n\nSome have complained about the Caesar Salad, but I happen to like it. It's a bit small and unpretentious, but has a pleasantly tangy dressing (and no anchovies). Even better is the more generously-sized Insalata Etrusca, with marinated white beans, shaved parmesan and fennel on a bed of mixed greens with a tart balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend the sinfully delicious house-made tiramisu or the chocolate pot de creme. I also like the chocolate brownie cake, the spumoni cake and chocolate-dipped biscotti. The cannoli is OK, but it's imported frozen from Italy so it doesn't taste as fresh as a locally-made product.\n\nIn 20 years, I've only had to send one dish back -- a fish dish that had an oily \"off\" taste. The waiter said it was fresh, and I believe him, but it just didn't taste right. No problem, no attitude, they were happy to prepare a different entree for me.\n\nFor those who say they've had a bad experience at Spiazzo, all I can say is that either you are awfully hard to please or you must have been there on a rare off night.

There was just the right amount of cheese and topings on it so you get a perfect mouthful with every bite. We definitely would order pizza again here, quite a few other on the menu to try.

I had always been curious about the place, but never enough to make it inside.  It wasn't until a couple of my friends put some serious limits on where to go for dinner one night that Spiazzo even came to mind.  Italian in this area of the city that's not Olive Garden?  Who knew Spiazzo was just one of a couple of places that could fit the bill?\n\nWalking in, I liked the feel of the restaurant - a little nicer than other casual, Italian joints but with a relaxed, neighborhood type of vibe.  We were able to snag the last free table, and I was moderately impressed with the assortment of dishes the menu had to offer.  I ordered the Minestrone and Spaghetti Portofino, and I was able to try the Beef Carpaccio my friend ordered for the table.\n\n- Minestrone (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NWu1cDtYArkjWw2F8PzU9Q?select=obS63fHpNd1fFiUVVaeRZg) - the portion was larger than I expected, but that's about it.  Pretty average considering you can find the same at a lot of other places in SF.  \n- Carpaccio di Manzo (Beef Carpaccio) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NWu1cDtYArkjWw2F8PzU9Q?select=67HuoK9sKfUvtMiuNbUmYw) - the beef was okay, but I liked the shaved parmesan and the argula.\n- Spaghetti Portofino (Spaghetti with Prawns and Scallops in a White Wine and Garlic Sauce) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NWu1cDtYArkjWw2F8PzU9Q?select=iEQuYUx3tf2fzcnkYxK9gA) - not too shabby.  I didn't like the prawns, but the scallops were okay and I liked the sauce.\n\nEven though I don't usually care about the bread a restaurant serves, Spiazzo's seemed a little weird.  Typically, fresh bread has a soft and fluffy core, but this one was dense and \"chunky\" (no other way to describe it).  Also, the service left me a little mixed - \"cold but efficient\" as my friend described.  Our waiter wasn't that friendly and didn't say more than he needed to, but he didn't mess up and was pretty quick.  Hard to complain when he didn't make a mistake.\n\nEven though it didn't really bowl me over, I can see why people might like Spiazzo.

It was extremely charming and endearing. I wish he was my uncle, but I will avoid my uncle issues in this post... To make things even better, when the bill came, we were surprisingly not charged a cake-cutting fee, as is standard at most other institutions.

It was pretty packed when we first got there and more and more people kept coming in as the tables were turned over. That must be a good sign that it's this busy on a weeknight.

The bread was delicious, light and fluffy, but not exactly like foccacia-texture. Though I do think it was suppose to be foccaccia. The marinara was cool that they give you a sauce instead of the usual butter, but it didn't taste exactly like just marinara and it was orange... I went with the butter instead. Others in my party liked it, I didn't care for it too much. \n\nOn to the food... every dish that came out looked so yummy and delicious and I don't think anyone had a complaint about the food.

But either way it was delicious and lots of fresh yummy seafood and the soup broth was so good! My husband's aunt ordered the clams and pasta dish, and the clams are SOO huge! Not your typical linguine and clams item. And it had a lot of pasta with some sort of sauce. My husband ordered the lamb meatballs with risotto, which did not look like risotto. It was rice i swear. But the lamb meatballs were very good, not gamey at all, fluffy with breadcrumbs and also crispy on the outside from searing it. My mother-in-law got the salmon pasta and she raved about how good it was also. So much pasta and salmon mixed into it. My husband's cousin got the ravioli with spinach and chicken I believe and the ravioli were also a large portion size! So you're eating more filling than just the pasta. \n\nOne downside to the place, the service of our waiter. He was definitely italian, but he was ALL over the place. He took the order of my mother-in-law then he walked away to take another table's order. Then he never returned to us until we beckoned another waiter. Then in the middle of taking our large party order, he refilled our bread and sauce! He definitely tried and worked hard, he just seemed very scattered-brain. \n\nParking was easy with street parking in front, or maybe we got lucky. But it didn't seem too bad on a weeknight. e", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Fusilli holds the sauce really well\n\nZuppa Di Pesce  - sauteed mussels, clams small shrimp calamari, scallops and generous pieces of seasonal fish in a light tomato broth served with spaghetti and garlic crostini.
