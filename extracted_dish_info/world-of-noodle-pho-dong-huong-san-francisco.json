It's clean. It's close to my place, so I will continue to go there.  \n\nNo onto the bad, they have a terrible customer experience, it appears they are very stingy.  This is worse than almost any economical Chinese restaurants in SF for instance.\n\nFirst off the the hours of this place are unreliable. The hours listed on Yelp are not accurate, the restaurant windows sign is different, and they tend to close a lot earlier. Worse, they frequently won't seat you if its within the last hour of their operation.  I've been turned away 40 minutes before closing. I've been turned away 4 times.  It doesn't take that long to eat a bowl of Pho.  And since you don't really know what time they are closing when you get there it makes it pretty hit or miss if it's after 8pm.\n\nSecond, they are beyond stingy with things like napkins, condiments etc. It always feels like you are disappointing them if you need more than one napkin etc.  You have to beg for these things apparently. \n\nThird, they don't heat the place. I was there today and it was the same temperature inside as outside, about 58 degrees.  Even the staff were wearing winter coats.   I was wearing a heavy sweat shirt and sweat pants, and I had to go back to my car to retrieve a full winter jacket to endure it.

The bus boy (lady) was around, but there were at least four tables that were not cleared. We sat among four other tables in the restaurant and the guy who asked us if we wanted water or tea. We asked for tea, but he returned with cups of hot water and apologized that they didn't have any tea. \n\nThe couple dishes are indeed good. Plenty of meat and the broth is great. The cost is a bit on the high side - $11. This was offset by the fact that they offered free Thai Iced Tea with an order. Take away the drink, account for so-so service, an 86 health score, an often cold dining room (tonight the were buckets because ceiling was leaking from the rain) and 3.5 stars falls around two. The table next to us was apparently discussing issues as well, so I asked how long they've been waiting-around 5min. They had cups of tea, strangely. I told them things seem very weird this evening and that I'm contemplating on leaving. They were thinking the same, but before we could finish talking the pissed off manager comes by and takes their order. He turns to us and I asked about the Thai Iced Tea, to which he flatly said \"we don't do no more\". That pretty much sealed the deal and we left.\n\nWe walked over to Shanghai Dumpling King.

After being such a long time patron, I felt that I should finally give a review to one of my favourite places to eat.  In my review I will cover the following: Prices, Location, Ambiance, Food, amongst other topics. I hope to provide the most accurate review possible for anyone planning on visiting this lovely place.\n\n-Food:\nFirst topic is food, since that is probably one of the most important questions -- \"Is the food good?\"\nThe food is great! i'ave had probably 1/3 of the items on their menu. My favorite is the #1 Dac Biet, i fell in love with that soup.  \nThe quality and quantity of food is definitely above average, and out of the six different Pho restaurants i've been too I can confidently say that this place has the best pho.  They don't skimp on the meat, the sides of pepper and cilantro/basil they give really adds flavor, and the broth is full of flavor. \n\"Well, is Pho the only thing they have that's good?\" I am glad you asked imaginary person who is talking to me. Yes. They have a wide variety of appetizers, which I would suggest getting the \"Goi Cuon Chay\" or the vegetarian spring role. They give this peanut sauce that taste amazing with the spring roles! I love meat, but the vegetarian spring roles with the peanut sauce is just fantastic. Also, try their noodle salad! I've not had it yet, but my friend went there and texted me saying it was great. So if you try it and don't like it you can blame Dominic for leading you astray.\n\nThat being said, they do have some foods that I wasn't a fan of. I tried their \"Nem Nuong Cuon\"\" aka their New Spring Role. It had pork in it which got me interested. There is this crunchy wafer in the center that I wasn't a fan of though and I thought clashed with the overall texture of what a spring role should be like.\n\"So Matt, you say they have overall good food but what about their prices?\" I was just about to get into that.\n\n-Price:\nThe overall price of this place i would say is mostly great. A bowl of Pho goes for about 10-14$. Actually, i think they only have one or two Pho Soups, out of their ten or so options, that are actually 14$. The overall prices for their Pho, Rice Plates, and Salads are very acceptable/affordable and with the quality and quantity of their food and their overall friendly and attentive service -- you won't feel cheated.\nThe exception I would say is their Drink selection and several of their appetizers. An Iced Coffee and Coconut Water are both $4. A little pricey considering you can just go next door to safeway and get the same thing for half that cost. HotTea is good though\nAs for the appetizers, I feel that some of the prices are a little inflated. The minimum for almost every single of the appetizer courses is $7, which is almost the price of an entree ($10 for a rice plate.) Granted, aside from their New Spring Roles i have been relatively pleased with their appetizers. I have had their egg role, new spring role, fried shrimp cake, pot sticker, vegetarian spring role, and vegetarian egg role. So 1/6 isn't bad.\n\n-Setting & Ambiance:\nwi-fi? No. Learn to hold a conversation or read a book you pleb.\nThe interior of the store is very clean. Like... they take good care of the restaurant you can tell. The colors of the interior is very plain, and they don't try and lure you in with fancy \"Asian\" motifs and decor. The feel of the place is very relaxed and, maybe it's the colors, but I always feel relaxed when I eat there. I think the only qualm I have about the place is that they play the same song over and over. One of the store guys hooks up his ipod and has that song playing in the background. Granted, it is a decent song. It's a female vocal singing in soft-pop kinda way. On top of them playing the same song over and over again, the song itself is kinda redundant like you can't really tell where is starts or ends. At least the song they choose is a relaxing and nice song. I mean it could be \"what's new pussy cat\" and that's much worse.\n\n-Location:\nThat's this place's greatest downfall in my opinion. There is little parking. I mean tons of people just park in the safeway parking lot... and i am NOT condoning that! Don't want my boss to find this and fire me cause I'm telling everyone to park at our store's parking lot and not buy stuff. Just stating a fact based on observation.\nBecause of where they are located, their primary clientele is normally locals, like me, or college students from the nearby campus that bother to look for restaurants in the area that aren't on ocean ave. \n\n-Recap & other:\nFood? Great\nPrices? Affordable entree, pricey appetizers\nClean? Always\nLocation? You should uber, take the bus, or walk -- don't drive there\n\nService? Always professional and friendly. They do a good job at giving you service without being overbearing. \n\nIn short, come try this place out!

Although the broth was flavorful, it was too spicy for my taste.\n\n\nTips: \n- After you get your delivery, I would suggest eating immediately because the noodles do tend to harden pretty quickly if not placed in hot broth in time.\n\nOverall:\n- I definitely have had better noodle soups than this place, but I would try this place again for delivery because of convenience, and I liked that they gave a free iced coffee. While they are convenient in this way, I think that their pricing is a teeny bit higher than expected, since I have had better quality elsewhere for cheaper.

You just gotta. I barely come to this homespun part of town because it's not on my way to anything in particular, maybe Big Joe's for their breakfast egg tart, but I think this pho spot just showed up on the Hot on Yelp list on my app. That's when I decided I would Shanghai Jamie W. for some pho. It's right next to the little Safeway on Monterey where there is conveniently an empty parking lot to use on a quiet Sunday evening. The place was spacious and pretty empty except for what looked to be some students, so we were able to park ourselves into one of their roomier booths.\n\nPho was on my mind, so I ordered the $11.99 Pho Combo (Dac Biet) and got a bonanza of beef in my bowl. Sliced rib-eye, flank tendon, brisket, and of course, those infamous beef balls made from God-knows-what animal by-product, or at least I thought it was an animal once (photo: http://bit.ly/2eVYknB). Despite a plethora of scallions and cilantro on top, the broth was lackluster and somewhat lukewarm. But I had no complaints about the amount of meat in there. Jamie was even more daring and ordered the $9.99 Combination Rice Noodle Soup (Hu Tieu Nam Vang) with the extra-wide noodles.\n\nHe just loves those extra-wide noodles ever since he discovered chow fun in some Chinese restaurant from his Michigan-based memory (Go Blue!). It also had shrimp, fish cakes, slices of pork, ground pork, and chicken, so it was quite a cornucopia of protein in there (photo: http://bit.ly/2fFMcHo). He liked his a bit more because of the variety, but he had similar complaints about the thinness of the broth. To offset some of our disappointment, we took a chance on a $6.99 order of the Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Banh Bao Soup Thuong Hai), and they weren't half-bad (photo: http://bit.ly/2fFl5Q5).

I work at the safeway next door to this restaurant & I go to the nearby college CCSF. After being such a long time patron, I felt that I should finally give a review to one of my favourite places to eat.  In my review I will cover the following: Prices, Location, Ambiance, Food, amongst other topics. I hope to provide the most accurate review possible for anyone planning on visiting this lovely place.\n\n-Food:\nFirst topic is food, since that is probably one of the most important questions -- \"Is the food good?\"\nThe food is great! i'ave had probably 1/3 of the items on their menu. My favorite is the #1 Dac Biet, i fell in love with that soup.  \nThe quality and quantity of food is definitely above average, and out of the six different Pho restaurants i've been too I can confidently say that this place has the best pho.  They don't skimp on the meat, the sides of pepper and cilantro/basil they give really adds flavor, and the broth is full of flavor. \n\"Well, is Pho the only thing they have that's good?\" I am glad you asked imaginary person who is talking to me. Yes. They have a wide variety of appetizers, which I would suggest getting the \"Goi Cuon Chay\" or the vegetarian spring role. They give this peanut sauce that taste amazing with the spring roles! I love meat, but the vegetarian spring roles with the peanut sauce is just fantastic. Also, try their noodle salad! I've not had it yet, but my friend went there and texted me saying it was great. So if you try it and don't like it you can blame Dominic for leading you astray.\n\nThat being said, they do have some foods that I wasn't a fan of. I tried their \"Nem Nuong Cuon\"\" aka their New Spring Role. It had pork in it which got me interested. There is this crunchy wafer in the center that I wasn't a fan of though and I thought clashed with the overall texture of what a spring role should be like.\n\"So Matt, you say they have overall good food but what about their prices?\" I was just about to get into that.\n\n-Price:\nThe overall price of this place i would say is mostly great. A bowl of Pho goes for about 10-14$. Actually, i think they only have one or two Pho Soups, out of their ten or so options, that are actually 14$. The overall prices for their Pho, Rice Plates, and Salads are very acceptable/affordable and with the quality and quantity of their food and their overall friendly and attentive service -- you won't feel cheated.\nThe exception I would say is their Drink selection and several of their appetizers. An Iced Coffee and Coconut Water are both $4. A little pricey considering you can just go next door to safeway and get the same thing for half that cost. HotTea is good though\nAs for the appetizers, I feel that some of the prices are a little inflated. The minimum for almost every single of the appetizer courses is $7, which is almost the price of an entree ($10 for a rice plate.) Granted, aside from their New Spring Roles i have been relatively pleased with their appetizers. I have had their egg role, new spring role, fried shrimp cake, pot sticker, vegetarian spring role, and vegetarian egg role. So 1/6 isn't bad.\n\n-Setting & Ambiance:\nwi-fi? No. Learn to hold a conversation or read a book you pleb.\nThe interior of the store is very clean. Like... they take good care of the restaurant you can tell. The colors of the interior is very plain, and they don't try and lure you in with fancy \"Asian\" motifs and decor. The feel of the place is very relaxed and, maybe it's the colors, but I always feel relaxed when I eat there. I think the only qualm I have about the place is that they play the same song over and over. One of the store guys hooks up his ipod and has that song playing in the background. Granted, it is a decent song. It's a female vocal singing in soft-pop kinda way. On top of them playing the same song over and over again, the song itself is kinda redundant like you can't really tell where is starts or ends. At least the song they choose is a relaxing and nice song. I mean it could be \"what's new pussy cat\" and that's much worse.\n\n-Location:\nThat's this place's greatest downfall in my opinion. There is little parking. I mean tons of people just park in the safeway parking lot... and i am NOT condoning that! Don't want my boss to find this and fire me cause I'm telling everyone to park at our store's parking lot and not buy stuff. Just stating a fact based on observation.\nBecause of where they are located, their primary clientele is normally locals, like me, or college students from the nearby campus that bother to look for restaurants in the area that aren't on ocean ave. \n\n-Recap & other:\nFood? Great\nPrices? Affordable entree, pricey appetizers\nClean? Always\nLocation? You should uber, take the bus, or walk -- don't drive there\n\nService? Always professional and friendly. They do a good job at giving you service without being overbearing. \n\nIn short, come try this place out! It's pretty great and I've yet to be disappointed.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-06-12"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered 2 vietnamese coffees, a coconut water, a taro shake, and a mango shake.

I was disappointed that you had to add $2 to get spring rolls though xD but they do give you a generous amount of sauce to pour in so watevs\n\n - 24 Com Suon $9.99 - Grilled/BBQ pork is my go to meat at Vietnamese restaurants~ Rice with a side of soup, grilled pork chop (a little saucier than the vermicelli one), and a few pickled vegetables with lettuce ---- I recommend getting this one because of all the pork/it's a bit cheaper for a full stomach\n\n- S3 Goi Du Du $6.99 - Ehh, this was pretty bland/tasteless, but if you like crunchy vegetables with a sprinkle of peanuts then go for it\n\n- Thai Iced Tea $4.00 - loved how it wasn't too sweet or too bitter! :)\n- Honeydew Shake $4.00 - you can definitely taste the honeydew/SUPER sweet in my opinion \n- Vietnamese Coffee $4.00 - more on the bitter side\n- Ordered but did not try: 2 Pho Tai, HK Milk Tea\n\nEach order can easily be shared between two people that aren't crazy hungry!
