So what better stuff to write about than the great stuff they serve at Stuffed!\n\nStuffed located on Mission Street near 24th Street serves up freshly made pierogies and other Polish inspired specialties.  I had them bookmarked on Yelp seemingly forever when I finally tried them last month.  I loved their food so much that I returned for more this weekend.  For those of you not in the know a pierogi is a dumpling usually boiled then either baked or fried consisting of a filling of mashed potatoes, meat and or vegetables.\n\nMy first encounter with the pierogi came many years ago in possibly the last place you'd expect.  Sold under the brand name \"Mrs. T's\" the little potato and cheese dumplings were boiled up and served to event participants at the finish line of the world famous Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon.  Served with a bit of marinara sauce and a dusting of parmesan cheese those little dumplings became a staple of mine in training for various races in which I took part in.  Finding the brand in my supermarket freezer became a bit of a chore though, and I eventually gave up looking and returned to more common pasta dishes for my carbo-loading and training ways.\n\nIt had been at least 10 years since I've had a real pierogi so I was excited.  I ordered the 2 pierogi meal with a jalapeno pierogi and a bacon cheddar one (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stuffed-san-francisco?select=FylvFlTVxWKZUqAhkKjDqg#QPaRawibu3D0ot_IG1rU5Q).  The pierogies come with a sweet red cabbage slaw and a very different and very delicious sauerkraut which incorporates apples and caraway seeds all sweetened with a bit of agave.  I got to choose between a creamy cucumber salad or a cold asparagus salad for which I chose the latter.  Everything on the plate blew me away.  I especially liked how the dumpling dough for the jalapeno pierogi was infused with jalapeno.  That was my favorite of the two.\n\nThis past weekend I happened to be in the neighborhood again for the Carnaval San Francisco parade, and after standing under the hot sun for 6 hours of Carnaval fun I immediately thought of Stuffed for a cold beer and more delicious pierogies.  Going with the theme for the day I ordered an icy cold Corona with lime and a 2 pierogi meal with the smoked salmon pierogi and the spicy avocado sausage pierogi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stuffed-san-francisco?select=FylvFlTVxWKZUqAhkKjDqg#FylvFlTVxWKZUqAhkKjDqg).  My salad choice for the day was the bell pepper broccoli salad.  Once again I enjoyed everything on the plate but I found I liked the spicy avocado pierogi with its smooth potato and avocado puree and chunks of sausage even more than the jalapeno one.\n\nStuffed offers delicious pierogies in many varieties including a blueberry dessert one that is served only during the dinner hours.  They also began pickling their own vegetables just a few weeks ago.  With cool bar style seating and an assortment of cold beers offered I imagine I'll be eating here more often.\n\nIf only Stuffed weren't open on weekdays at the exact same hours that I'm at my job.  That's okay though.  They're opened all day on weekends and that gives me more delicious pierogi stuff to look forward to.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-05-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Get the three pierogi meal and you will be satisfyingly full.

The buffalo is probably my favorite, but it is really hard to choose a favorite among all of the great pierogi offerings they give. \n\nYou can't forget the sides either. Every meal gets three sides: Apple sauerkraut, sweet slaw, and your choice of cucumber or bell pepper salads. The bell pepper is my favorite of the two. \n\nHungry and eating alone? Get the three pierogi meal and you will be satisfyingly full. You won't feel like you ate a ton of bricks like a lot of bigger portions. It's just perfect. \n\nI highly recommend checking it out as a pre or post bar food and drink or just a lunch or dinner date for something different than any other joint in San Francisco can offer.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-06-08"}, {"excerpts": ["My wife and I stopped in for dinner and each had the three pierogi meal.
