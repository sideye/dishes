San Francisco has never really been known for its Vietnamese food and it's place like this that prove the notion to be true. Most of all I've sampled here in some way remind me of the Vietnamese fare back home in NYC. which is not a good thing. Hence, 3.5 stars rounded down is the best I can do for now.\n\nLike most Vietnamese spots that specialize in noodles and soups, pho is a natural benchmark to go on. Only problem is, the broth is mad bland. I've had my fair share of pho tai and pho tai chin / nam bowls here, all priced accordingly at less than $7 each but either its loaded with MSG (likely) and / or prepped with subpar seasoning (also likely). In the unlikelihood its just bad luck, I still haven't mustered a decent bowl of pho here just yet.\n\nThe other noodle soups, like bun rieu, hu tieu, and bun bo hue  or even mi hai son (seafod) are also low on the Viet totem pole of deliciousness. The broth in all need some work. From a noodle standpoint, the consistency is there, but the broth is one essential that locks everything in place; an equalizer of sorts. It's just not there and that strikes out a sizeable portion of the menu. \n\nRice plates have fared better, which is their saving grace. Their meaty combo platter - com suon lap xuong tau hu ky (aka Chinese sausage, pork chop, and shrimp cake) is a mean dish, especially when doused with a tangy but sweet nuoc mam fish sauce. I also have some love for the bun thit nuong cha gio, otherwise known as vermacelli with pork chop and spring rolls. It's got a lot of textures going on, served in a decent portion if I've ever seen one.\n\nWhile there are some Viet servers, let us not forget this is The Richmond area. Most everyone will be Chino, which includes lots of the wait staff.

The cuts of beef in the soup are good quality, and the noodles are fine. And he appreciates that \"small\" sizes are available (\"People from Vietnam think it's weird how our bowls of pho in the U.S. are so big\").\n\nParking is not always the greatest in this part of the Sunset, but during the weeknights it's not so bad. The restaurant is pretty spacious, and the longest we've ever waited for a seat is 5 minutes.\n\nSide note to the pho: the spring rolls (goi cuon), which my fianc\u00e9 usually doesn't go for even in the South Bay, are fresh and delicious here. The consistency when you bite into them is just perfect. Probably because they are made to order, with good quality rice paper and fresh shrimp and veggies.

Number tables sequentially so you can put it on the guests check and manage the logistics of payment after the meal. The numbers must be in standard gold and black sticker decals of regulation height and placement, centered on the wall next to the table, or affixed prominently on the side of the silver napkin holder or silver table accessories caddy if there is no nearby wall. \n\n2. The guest check must be in 2 parts, with a detachable small bottom that you throw randomly on the table, where you can write the table number that matches the table, and the top part of the check, which you leave at the cashier in random cascaded piles. \n\n3. Have the standard Chinese/Vietnamese silver table caddy for: \na) Faux marble plastic beige chopsticks (must hold at least 50, try green/red if you want to look different, but not recommended) \nb) Soup spoons, must be plastic with faux blue porcelain appearance, rice or fish design\nOptions C - room for red squeeze bottle of Hoy Sin Sauce and off the 99 Ranch store shelf Sri Racha Tung Ot sauce, soy sauce, and glass dish for hot chili oil with silver lid and plastic spoon. If not room in caddy, place on table as if there was. \nOption D - add room for mini-saucer for condiments, i.e. Hoy Sin sauce and Sri Racha, to dip your Pho meat to season and eat, instead of dumping all of that into the broth and spoiling the 4 hour broth flavor you tried to create \n(but let Low Fan squeeze into broth, because that is what they are trained to do with catsup bottle on French Fries, or mustard on Hot Dogs, or thousand Island on Salads) \n\n4. Have 1 man serve as arbitrator of guest seating, and order taking. Must know menu by number and name, and good at pointing. Must know how to decipher Low Fan pronunciation in Vietnamese of Pho (Foh instead of Fa-uh). \n\n5. Substitute for man only when necessary with young cute girl (preferable a relative) who is tough and doesn't smile, otherwise leave women at cashier desk to handle money and sort out guest checks (preferable matriarch from Vietnam with poor English skills). Secret is, women are observant, so even though guests don't know their table number, she does, and can find the right check within 3 attempts, max, usually in 1 try.  \n\n6. Have older male staff as food runners, because their skin isn't as sensitive.  Must be able to handle hot bowls of soup, possibly with thumb over lip into bowl, for balance. No English skills required, in fact avoid. Refer to #4 man/arbitrator for questions. Cart/bussing skills a plus. \n\nI ordered Pho Tai Gau, medium. The broth was pretty good, a decent balance of sweet and sour. Not too mucked up with extras, but nice onions. The noodles were good, clumped as is typical, but not falling apart, or milky or mushy. The meat was average in quantity, but it was tougher than my now standard near Concord,  Pho Lee Hoa Phat (which also has several locations in the east bay).

May warts grow all over the feet of your proverbial walks in life.\n\nMoving on.  Were it not for the cursed place I mentioned above, Marina and I would not have found our way over here.  It was around 9:15 on a Saturday night.  We found parking about a block away.  We had previously been shopping in Union Square.  I was getting a suit (grown up clothing!) and she got this nice pair of knee lenth clam-digger type jeans.  All on sale.  \n\nAfter attempting to go to Chez Papa Resto and realizing how incredibly small that place was, we looked around at another french place before getting in to the car.  Whilst in the car, I told her about the amazing broth of pho.  It was spiced, cinnamon, anise, a bit of cardamon.  I sold it so well that we headed straight for the sunset.  \n\nThere was a false start (and we'd found such GOOD PARKING too), we ended up here.  I was famished.  Hadn't eaten since noon.  Not even a snack.  I ordered the Imperial rolls and the fried chicken wings.  The imperial rolls were nice and compact.  Meaty, tight, turgid tubes of fried loveliness.  \n\nThe chicken wings were HUGE.  I don't know what chickens these came off of, but the wingspan was the size of my hand!  Not just the palm.  I'm talking about the biggest wings ever.  The drumette looked like a full size leg drumstick.  \n\nAnd now the pho.  Marina go the Pho Tai.  I got the Pho Tai Gan.  This time I paid more attention to the tendon.  This place had nice juicy thick pieces that quivered and shook in my unsteady hands.  The tendon was substantial and not chopped up in to sliced like the TL plcaes. It was something I could sink my teeth in to.  \n\nI made sure to sip the broth before adding anything.  While I could still smell the anise and a bit of cinnamon, the fragrance was not as strong as at Yummy Yummy or Pho King.  But it was there.  A different style of broth.  It's ok.  Not all pho broth has to taste the same.  \n\nLet us not allow pho broth to go the way of expensive trendy wines: suiting the tastebuds of that guy who gives out points just so they get a high score.

San Francisco has never really been known for its Vietnamese food and it's place like this that prove the notion to be true. Most of all I've sampled here in some way remind me of the Vietnamese fare back home in NYC. which is not a good thing. Hence, 3.5 stars rounded down is the best I can do for now.\n\nLike most Vietnamese spots that specialize in noodles and soups, pho is a natural benchmark to go on. Only problem is, the broth is mad bland. I've had my fair share of pho tai and pho tai chin / nam bowls here, all priced accordingly at less than $7 each but either its loaded with MSG (likely) and / or prepped with subpar seasoning (also likely). In the unlikelihood its just bad luck, I still haven't mustered a decent bowl of pho here just yet.\n\nThe other noodle soups, like bun rieu, hu tieu, and bun bo hue  or even mi hai son (seafod) are also low on the Viet totem pole of deliciousness. The broth in all need some work. From a noodle standpoint, the consistency is there, but the broth is one essential that locks everything in place; an equalizer of sorts. It's just not there and that strikes out a sizeable portion of the menu. \n\nRice plates have fared better, which is their saving grace. Their meaty combo platter - com suon lap xuong tau hu ky (aka Chinese sausage, pork chop, and shrimp cake) is a mean dish, especially when doused with a tangy but sweet nuoc mam fish sauce.
