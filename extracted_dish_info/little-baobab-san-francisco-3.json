It is a \"hipster\" joint BUT IT IS A VERY WORTHY HIPSTER JOINT. Every Tuesday night there is something happening and this evening they had dancing and drumming. Place gets very packed and we got a table. Great menu, alcoholic drinks are cheaper then regular drinks, and there's happy hour specials on the food. \n\nHEFER STATS.\n\nWe stayed with the happy hour food special (1 cocktail, 1 appetizer, and 1 main dish) for $20... worth it and you will be leaving STUFFED. Check-in with yelp and you get free Aloko.\n\n(1) ALOKO - Ripe plantains fried to perfection and served with our handmade tamarind yogurt dipping sauce. This was pretty good, that handmade tamarind sauce put the good sweet factor on top of the plantains.\n\n(2) BAOBAB GAMBAS - Sauteed prawns marinated in garlic and cayenne pepper, served in a red curry with pita bread. CRACKING!!! OMG SO GOOD!!! It came with pieces of flatbread. If you think chachacha's gambas are good, you really have no idea about Baobab Gambas. One of the best gambas I've ever had. I couldn't get enough of this. I like to call this GAMBAS IN CRACK SAUCE, so addicting and delicious. We wrapped up dinner a couple hours ago and I'm still sprung on it.\n\n(3) MAFE - Chicken, sauteed mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and spinach served in a curry peanut sauce. This was very nice. The chicken was fall off the bone good and the sauce reminded me of a Filipino dish called KareKare. It had a nice peanut flavor, at first the heat isn't there but after half way you will start to feel some heat. ITS SO GOOD!!!! \n\n(4) TATU - hibiscus margarita. Nothing margarita about this drink at all. It tasted like spiked hibiscus juice!!!! \n\n(5) PITCHER OF SORANGE - i think thats the drink. We shared a pitcher, enjoyed each others company, and some music. I think i like this drink better then the Tatu.\n\nAfter dinner we were able to watch the performances of drummers and dancers.

"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Senegal.\n\nWell, we all know how my geography is. I thought Cancun was in the United States so naturally, I thought Senegal was in Spain. Why? Because \"Senegal, Spain\" had a nice ring to it. I then remember that I confused that with Portugal.\n\nUmm yah, I wouldn't last a day much less a round on the Amazing Race. =/\n\nAnyhow, Senegalese cuisine is like Afro-Caribbean cuisine; where most meat and veggies dishes are stewed then poured over rice or couscous. Bissap Baobab and Little Baobab are the only restaurants in SF that serve Senegalese cuisine. They're actually two places in one as Bassip Baobab (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bissap-baobab-san-francisco) is inside Little Baobab. Both serve the same food but Bassip has late night live music performances while Little Baobab turns into a club after dinner.\n\nLittle Baobab is one funky place; it's divey, loud, hot, and kitschy. Not an ideal place to bring a date because there's just too much going on (i.e annoying flashing lights) that it's distracting to even maintain a convo, however, it's a cool place to check out once as it showcases the vast diversity of the city. \n\nLittle Baobab offers numerous deals. From their everyday happy hour menu: http://bit.ly/17xI6Yj and 1 app, 1 entr\u00e9e, and 1 house cocktail for $20 before 7 pm to their 30% off your entire dinner bill (including drinks) if you book a reservation on Savored.com. Looks like they also have a Yelp deal and my friend told me they have a Bloomspot deal as well. Make sure to take advantage of these if you come. Had it not been for the Savored.com deal, this would be a 2 star review. As a a side note, there seems to be a lot of sketchy 5 star reviews. \n\nOverall the food and drinks were about 3.5. The much raved about Tatu: Hibiscus Margarita ($7): http://bit.ly/1038Auk was way too strong but the Coconut Infused Rum ($7): http://bit.ly/18cPXvv was deliciously creamy. If it wasn't a Sunday night, I would have gotten a pitcher all for myself. \n\nThe Avocat Creole ($8.75): http://bit.ly/130czNG was canned tuna with spicy mayo NOT crab (they should update their menu to reflect this since some people are allergic to fish). The accompanying yucca fries were hard and stale. I would skip this app. For my entr\u00e9e, I order the Mafe w/ Chicken in a Peanut Sauce & Couscous ($11.75): http://bit.ly/11VI8qM which was delicious. The chicken drumsticks were stewed to a fall-off-the-bone tenderness with a decadently creamy peanut sauce that I slathered all over the couscous before devouring. It was one satisfying dish. \n\nService was a whole other story though. \n\nFor a 15 year old restaurant, they sure operate like a rookie. Service was like watching paint dry on the wall.\n\n6:50 pm: Arrived for our 7 pm reservations.\n6:55 pm: Ordered drinks.\n7:10 pm: Ordered one appetizer while waiting for our friend to arrive.\n7:15 pm: Ordered two more appetizers and entrees.\n7:35 pm: Asked waitress for an update on our apps.\n7:45 pm: After a 35 min wait, the wrong app was brought (ordered yucca fries but received chips and guacamole).\n7:55 pm: Second app (Avocat Creole) arrived and we ask what happened to the third app.\n8:05 pm: We were told they ran out of shrimp which was why they couldn't make the third app. It took 50 minutes to figure out they ran out of shrimp?!?\n8:06 pm: Entrees arrived 50 minutes after ordering. \n\nMost of the dishes are stews which means its pre-made or at least semi pre-made so it should NOT take 50 minutes to get your food....on a Sunday night...at a less than half full restaurant. \n\nOur waitress was super sweet and apologetic about the wait and comped the apps (thank you). We later found out it was her first day so we can't fault her. Instead, the owner/manager who was making cocktails for his friends at the bar should have been overseeing his staff especially new wait staff. Instead of socializing, he could of helped the kitchen and waitresses to ensure the food arrives to customers before the paint on the walls dry.\n\nA good restaurant doesn't need to offer deals to attract business especially not simultaneous deals. Although dinner was cheap with the Savored.com deal, you get what you pay for at Little Baobab.

The appetizers were good...had something that had bread with dipping sauce with shrimp. Then we had Aloko- plantains with sweet tamarind sauce which was surprisingly good. I had the chicken mafe with rice. This was awesome. Chicken with peanut sauce and spinach. Very tasty. If I was just rating this dish, I would give it 5 stars. \n\nNow on to the club.  I like African beats and the music was very catchy. It seemed like a combination of Caribbean, House, Meringue and Salsa. You know the awkward moment at any club at the beginning of the evening where no one wants to be the first on the dance floor and people hang around till there are more people on the floor so they can lose themselves in the crowd. Well, I am kinda like that too. Anyways, since the music was really good, we got on the dance floor and were doing our thing. But other than a couple of other people, nobody else was dancing! There are benches on the sides and it seemed like folks were content just sitting and watching us. My date got weirded out after like 5 songs and we ended up leaving. Good food, great music, could have been an awesome time if only the more people got up and danced.

I know, I know... we should have asked ahead of time... sometimes forthought isn't my strongest virtue, I'm sorry.  I promise to try harder next time.  Cut me some slack, I'm giving you food intel you'll thank me for later.\n\nAll in all, the short version of this is, fear not when your friends adventurously suggest African cuisine for dinner, instead let your salivary glands go into overdrive knowing you've read this review and know what you're getting into.  It will be a flavor adventure of you will be grateful to have been a part of.\n\n**Bonus Round: Get stamped before you leave and come back when it turns into a dance club for awesome music and a loveable crowd!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-10-18"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend and I got an aloko appetizer, the seafood coco with shrimp, the maafe with chicken and the yassa with tilapia.\n\n", "The aloko served as a good appetizer/dessert.\n\n", "The seafood coco was by far the best dish; the sauce was really creamy and delicious.\n\n", "The yassa had an interesting mustard flavor profile.\n\n"], "author": "Sharon H.", "review": "My friend and I got an aloko appetizer, the seafood coco with shrimp, the maafe with chicken and the yassa with tilapia.\n\nThe aloko served as a good appetizer/dessert.\n\nThe seafood coco was by far the best dish; the sauce was really creamy and delicious.\n\nThe yassa had an interesting mustard flavor profile.\n\nThe chicken maafe was good, but nothing special.\n\nGet the coucous with your entrees instead of rice.\n\nI got all the food as takeout from Bissap Baobab because Little Baobob was closed.

We initially arrived, set on a night of sobriety, but caved to the hibiscus and ginger margaritas. And dang, they were good. It took adjusting of the taste buds but I ended up really liking the flavor of both... and you can't even taste the alcohol which is awessssomeee.\n\nWe started with the Pastelles which was helllla bomb. I had the Yassa w/ the tilapia fillet and he had the Seafood Coco with prawns. Both entrees were delicious. Mmmmmm.. and the best part was the dessert -- Mango Melba -- who knew mangos could taste so good with chocolate sauce?!\n\nLittle Baobab becomes a dance club around 10. The DJ played a good mix that night, comprised of mainly reggae. Its a good spot if you're just looking to unwind and not get too cray cray.\n\nThe shack-like feeling of the restaurant, the benches, the cramped space, the paintings/photos on the wall, the friendly service, the amazing food, the good music at the end of the night -- makes you feel like you're not even in SF anymore!

The place was pretty crowded. Its small with limited seating. Get a reservation and  reach on time to get seated. We had  to wait at the bar till we were seated as we reached late. The ambiance had a cozy and fun vibe.\n\nWe ordered : \n1 pitcher hibiscus margarita and a tamarind pitcher - both of which were delicious like never tasted before!!\n\nEntree : \nGambas - prawns in curry sauce with rice, was yummilicious!\nseafood coco - heavenly with the creamy sauce \ndibi - tilapia dish, totally enjoyed\n\nThe food and drinks score a perfect 10, everyone enjoyed the heartiest meal. 5 star for food.\n\nHowever inspite of the great food we had a few complaints. As they started rearranging the dining area at 10 to make the dance floor everything went hay way. They didn't care of the people who were still eating and the service completely disappeared. As we were still eating, tables and chairs were removed, many of our orders just didn't arrive and noone even bothered to inform, for every little thing we had to run after a waiter to catch their attention! WHAT THE HELL!! You cant just throw away the customers who are still dining to start off your dance floor or atleast have some plan of order !!\n\nSomehow we finished our food in a hurry and as a compensation to our complaints we were offered a complimentary pitcher without an apology! Great!! Hence the service deserves just 1 star.\n\nOnce the music started the fun began, a complete refreshment to hear some different music unlike other clubs. The music was fantastic and everyone enjoyed. But the space was soo crammed that soon we could hardly stand and had to leave soon. \n\nMight return some day due to the impression the food made, but still forces to give a second thought for the clumsy service!!", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-08-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered:\n\nEntree: Seafood Coco w/ tilapia \nOH.

I enjoyed every dish and can't wait to come back for more.\n\nAloko is their fried plantain. The description says it's served with a yogurt  sauce but I thought it's more like a vinaigrette. I preferred a heavier yogurt base in the sauce, but still good. \n\nPastellas with beef: Carbs and Protein are my absolute favorite! This reminded me of an empanada except it's served in a sauce which was delicious.\n\nBaobab Gambas: Shrimp in red curry  sauced served with pita bread. I am so happy they have this dish. All I needed was a scoop of rice and a spoon.\n\nMy favorite dish here is the Seafood CoCo with Talapia. The Talapia is skewered on a bamboo stick, seared to perfection and served in a coconut curry sauce with rice. BOMB! My fianc\u00e9 couldn't stop pointing at the dish with his fork after each bite. The rice is a bit dry so make sure you mix it into the curry to soak up that flavor.\n\nWe also ordered the Chicken Mafe. Its drumsticks braised in a peanut based curry sauce. The chicken was soft and fell off the bone. The description says peanut curry, so expect a very strong peanut base. I don't mind peanuts, but this was a bit much for me.\n\nThe hibiscus juice was a popular item on yelp so we ordered a regular hibiscus and ginger hibiscus. It was refreshing, but not worth the $3.50 price tag.\n\nLastly we had the Thiakry for dessert. I didn't like this.

The ambiance is lovely: somewhat dim lighting, but candles light up every table, while lights on strings line the walls and parts of the ceiling. \n\nThe Tropical Salad was refreshing and delicious. Plenty of feta cheese sprinkled on top of fresh salad leaves and a circle of grapefruit and orange slices on the plate's outer ring. Bursts of flavor, sweet, slightly salty and sour, made it a great appetizer. Only bummer was that I asked for it with shrimp, but maybe they ran out? All good, still very appetizing.\n\nTook a tiny sip of the tamarind margarita, Salaan. Stung instantly and I scrunched up my face at its bitterness, but the aftertaste was alright; it settled into a smoother, sweet flavor. Guess I just like my juice/other basic sweet drinks haha. OJ over here, please!\n\nChicken Mafe with couscous. YUM. The sauce was just right, not over or under whelming, and the chicken meat just fell right off the bone. That is chicken done right! Came with two large drumsticks and a hearty serving of couscous, which I was surprised to find tons of raisins in - good thing we like raisins! The proportions of couscous and chicken were just right and both tasted great.\n\nBanana Flambee... wow. Anything banana is a plus in my book, but it was warm, chocolatey, rich, and the perfect ending to the meal. There were plenty of banana chunks too, so we were stuffed with dessert goodness.
