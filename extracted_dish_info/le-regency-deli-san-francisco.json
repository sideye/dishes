They're extremely quick, always friendly, and offer tasty sandwiches with fresh ingredients.\n\nSPEED\nEven when there's a line out the door, it's never taken me more than a few minutes to get through the line, order my sandwich, pay, and make my way out.  There's only one line, but two people making sandwiches.  Sometimes they even have assistants helping out.  I think it helps that both staff and patrons seem to have a routine here, which helps things keep moving smoothly.\n\nFRIENDLINESS\nWhen I first started coming here, I was caught a little off guard that the lady at the counter used terms like Baby, My Love, and Papi to address me.  Let's be honest, I didn't mind. Then I realized that she speaks to ALL of the customers this way.  The rest of the staff is always friendly as well.\n\nFOOD\nThe only reason I didn't rate this place 5 stars is because there are better sandwiches out there.  That's not to say these aren't good sandwiches, because they are.  The ingredients are always fresh.
