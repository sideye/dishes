We ordered:\n- Hummus appetizer: flatbread cracker chips and hummus, along with lots of veggies on the plate. Pretty good, worth the $9 I think\n- Fried Rainbow carrot appetizer: deep fried carrots served with a yummy sauce: Good, but not a large enough portion to warrant the $12 I don't think\n- Margarita Flatbread - 6 pieces, about 9 inches by 6 inches. Delicious, and the cheese was particularly noteworthy as being something other than standard mozzarella. Worth the $16\n- Wild Mushroom Pasta - relatively small pasta dish served on a big plate, with a foamy sauce. Neat presentation and apparently really good, I'm really excited to pay the $19 to get this next time I come. \n- Broccoli De Cicco Flatbread - Looked good, with roasted broccoli on the top. Also $16\n- Bacon Flatbread - It was decent, but I think I would have preferred a second Margarita flatbread if I could do the order over. Also $16\n- Tri-Tip Sandwich - Served with fries, this sandwich came between huge toasted pieces of bread. It looked amazing!  $18\n- Flank Steak - Well seasoned and garnished, but relatively small (6-8oz maybe?) and with a side of potatoes, if I recall. $28\n\nAll in all the 30 minute wait in the entrance left us in a poor mood, but the comped appetizers and the good food / cool environment / attentive waitress and hostess made up for it.

The decor is apparently inspired by the 1849 Gold Rush with a predominance of dark woods and steel beams with a marble bar and a conspicuous chandelier encased in an oversized glass lantern. There's a 60's-style abstract painting of the Transamerica building at the bar which I assume is mounted there to remind you what city you're in. I've come here for lunch twice now, both times as a solitary diner at the bar just trying to test the limits of my plant-based dietary direction.\n\nThe first time I came I tried the $12 Panzenella Salad with Bloomsdale Spinach, which I thought was pretty good though a bit hamstrung from the puckery flavor of the fresh lemon oregano vinaigrette that was doused over it. It was mixed with chunks of roasted root vegetables, mostly turnips, and topped with shaved pecorino. The second time I visited, I ordered the $13 Berries and Rucola Salad, which was certainly pretty on the plate (see photo). The fresh raspberries and blackberries freckled the peppery greens and offered a nice contrast. It only came with two Shaft bleu cheese fritters, and I couldn't even taste the bacon lardons or even the bacon vinaigrette. On both trips, I ordered the $4 cup of Soup of Yesterday, which I assume was made for the dinner menu from the evening prior.\n\nI must admit the soup was the best part of both lunches probably because in both cases, it was luxuriantly creamy. The most memorable was the Carrot Puree with a drizzle of what I assumed to be extra virgin olive oil infused with red peppers (see photo). Chef Adam Hinojosa comes from the more traditional Osteria, so the Italian accents in the dishes are to be expected here. I'm not sure if the upstairs room has more of a dining room ambiance since the downstairs area appears to be centered around the bar with a robust wine and cocktail menu. Perhaps I'll come back with some colleagues to try those. Right now, my impression is that the food is above average with prices that seem a tad excessive for the portions. I would really need a per diem to cover the bill.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty good salads, soup is better even if it was made yesterday\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nice decorator touches and quieter than you would expect, at least for lunch\nSERVICE - 3 stars...reasonable, nothing more\nTOTAL - 3 stars...middling until I try some of their other entrees, I hope", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-06-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Boosting two levels and two bars with dark woods, bronzes, and steel beams the ambiance was reminiscent of the Gold Rush Era.

Filing consultant contracts, I would be in awe of the payment terms \"USD 1,000 per day plus $150 per diem\". As I looked at my paycheck, I would silently curse at myself for ever majoring in Human Resources aka Professional Paper Pusher aka Office B*tch. \n\nFrom the people that brought you The Brick Yard (a sports bar in the Marina) comes Per Diem which is located in the epicenter of the Financial District. Boosting two levels and two bars with dark woods, bronzes, and steel beams the ambiance was reminiscent of the Gold Rush Era. The space screams M-O-N-E-Y which is correctly captured in their old money and new money cocktail list. Glancing over the $13 cocktails, I asked myself, \"So THIS is what consultants use their per diem (daily allowance) for?\" Again, I silently cursed at myself; talk about choosing the wrong career path. \n\nAlthough categorized as New American cuisine, Per Diem's menu is very Italian-centric. With 5 apps, 4 salads, 5 pasta, 4 entrees, and 3 pizzas options, I thought the menu was a bit scant (the online menu had more choices). Unless you're carbo loading for a marathon, there were few options. \n\nWith my imaginary per diem to burn, I started with the Blue Chip Martini w/ Bleu Cheese & Olive Crostini ($13). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=4yVLomcsA_-c0l1U4g3Jsw Worth every penny, the Nolet's Gin martini was stiff and made for one \"happy\" hour sans the happy price.  \n\nWe started our meal with the PEI Mussels in a Fennel Sausage Broth ($12). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=6havZYT-e-fqvAcXcJ-MSA What the mussels lacked in size, the complexity of the broth made up in flavor. The rich, herbaceous broth was intensified with the small chunks of fatty sausage. I think \"spicy\" was inadvertently omitted from the title as the broth packed quite a powerful and lingering heat. \n\nEverything was going seemingly well until I got my entree. The Braised Tomato Truffle Brisket, Lentils & Marinated Cipollini Onions ($21) was a disaster on a plate and should have never left the kitchen.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=mjnQ_DyMJRmv3A6qypco1w The brisket bricks were severely underseasoned and not braised long enough (to break down the collagen in the connective tissue) causing the texture to be that of shoe leather. Instead of a butter knife, a chain saw should have been included with this dish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=BsSgdKyB2osonsfzswGb9w The accompanying lentils were overcooked to a prison food mush. Tomatoes? Truffles? I think they were playing hide & seek on me as not even an essence was present. \n\nService was pleasant but unpolished; understandable for a restaurant open less than three months. However, simple things like providing new utensils (after taking ours away) and refilling BOTH our water glasses were overlooked. \n\nThough Per Diem has solid cocktails, their menu and food need work. I'll be back though...the day I have the luxury of a per diem. Until then, I will happily enjoy my $2 Gordon's Gin & Tonic at the Tappa Kegga Dayya brotherhood event at City Tavern in the Marina on Tuesday nights.

Trickled in for lunch on a Friday afternoon, found a couple seats at the bar as the rest of the 1st floor tables were taken and what a great decision it was.
