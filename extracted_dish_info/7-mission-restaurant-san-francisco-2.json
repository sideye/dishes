I can't tell if the resto is more Chinese or Vietnamese as they serve both but their food is decent.\n\nSo far, I've had their Won Ton Soup w/Noodles, which was good but it didn't have pieces of chicken or pork like others spots serve it up but, it fixed my craving, not sure I'd order it again though.  I've also had their Salt & Pepper Pork Chop Rice plate.  For some reason at the time, it was served to me warm, borderline cold but the steamed rice was piping hot.  There was a good, lunch sized portion of pork chop, which was tasty, could've used a little more pepper and jalapeno but, that's just me.  Their Mongolian Beef Rice plate was decent, my only complaint, which is common for most every Chinese resto I've been to is that they load it up with veggies, the red peppers, green peppers, green onions, onions and just a few pieces of beef.  By the time I was done, all those veggies were what was left on the plate.\n\nThey serve you hot tea automatically but sometimes you have to ask for it.  I've ordered their Vietnamese Iced Coffee twice which was a nice treat to end my meal, not to mention, to keep me awake for the rest of the day.\n\nService, just like the tea, is hit or miss, but overall has been friendly.

Theirs are fatter, thicker, and soak up sauce way better (plus they strain better so you don't have soo much water at the bottom). The BBQ pork was the most tender thing that I have ever ate, Mississippi smoked BBQ included. Honestly, my only beef with this is that the wrapping for the imperial rolls are not the glass wrapper dough (like they use for any salad roll). Easy way to tell this is if your eggroll is brown/tan it's normal wanton wrapper, it is a dirty white -- you got glass wrapper, which gets crispier. \n\nShrimp Salad Roll (2): IT HAS BBQ BEEF IN IT.
