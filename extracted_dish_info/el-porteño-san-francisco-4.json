And I ain't talking about the food; Hello Russell Wong and Christian Meier! Too bad, they can't make babies together. And too bad, I don't know anyone of that joint ethic makeup so I'll have to revert to talking about food. Boring I know...\n\nEl Porteno | Chifa Peruano is home to the only Chinese-Peruvian restaurant in SF (that I know of). It's basically the successors of Chifa Peruano (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chifa-peruano-san-francisco-2) with new owners and a more expensive menu. The prices aren't yipster expensive but at about 20-30% more than their old menu, it's a bit pricey for this more sketchy area of the city.\n\nOne side of the menu features your typical Americanized Chinese food while the other side features Peruvian items. Other than the ceviche, expect a carb heavy menu with lots of fried items and meat. Not a place I could eat at frequently because the food is heavy. For those who are sensitive to msg, El Porteno uses it even in their Peruvian items. Most of the sauces are premade beforehand with msg but you can ask that they chef prepare you something without it.\n\nWe started with the Causa de camarones ($8.95) which is basically a shrimp salad stacked between a mash potato mixture and topped with an aioli sauce: http://bit.ly/1m6kpim. Very creamy and delicious but I could detect some msg in the sauce as it numbed my tongue and made me thirsty. \n\nIf you like fried food, El Porteno is the place for you. The Chicharron de pollo ($7.98) is a solid choice is you like chicken karaage: http://bit.ly/1hCkV2p. It was crunchy and moist. A dab of the citrus sauce helped cut through some of the richness. I'm not sure what possessed us to order another fried dish but we did. The Jalea ($14.98) is a must order if you're a fried calamari (or fried seafood) fan: http://bit.ly/Rv98wK. The combo of the fresh seafood and light, uber crunchy (not greasy) batter made this a winner. Loved the accompanying fried corn and pickled red onions. Too bad, I was fried out from out former dish to eat more of this dish.  \n\nInitially, I wanted a stewed chicken dish for my entr\u00e9e but the chef/owner told me the sauce they use is already made using msg. I was bummed but she offered to whip up a plate of her Lomo Saltado without msg and promised it would be good. I'm not a fan of Lomo Saltado, this is usually Mr. NSS' go-to dish but the chef/owner delivered on her promise. This was by far the best Lomo Saltado ($12.95) I've tried and was even better than La Mar's, Mi Lindo Peru's, and Limon's version: http://bit.ly/1m6kUZE. The strips of beef were incredibly tender and flavorful while the fries still maintained a slight crispness to them. That rice doe, perfectly al-dente with a subtle richness from the broth (?) it was cooked in. I gave my leftovers to Mr. NSS and he made it a point to text me at work at how good it was. \n\nThey do serve pisco sour but it's premade from a bottle. Being responsible adults now, my childhood bff and I chugged chicha moradas (Peruvian purple corn drink) instead. Such a far cry from waking up and wondering how we got home. We're all grown up now!\n\nService from the chef/owner was very sweet and timely. I really appreciated that she was forthcoming about the use of msg (so many restaurants claim to not use it and I later find out the hard way that they do) and did her best to make sure our dishes were free from it. My only minor gripe is they charge $1-$1.50 for to-go boxes. What the heezy?!\n\nIf you're ever in this neck of the woods and Popeye's across the street is too hood for you, give El Porteno a shot.

I go to the better ones, where recipes have been handed down from generation to generation, & are made with a little TLC. Those are the places that I would take my friends that visit Lima with me, & that's exactly what I found today at El Porte\u00f1o!\n\nSo today I finally made the trek to give El Porte\u00f1o a world. I ordered three of my favorite chifa dishes. \n\nFirst up, Camlu Wonton... food came out in about 10 mins, nice and hot. We went in for the first bite wontons were not over saturated with sauce, and crunchy. Veggies, although in sauce, still had some crunch to them which is how I like it. The pork perfect, the chicken also just right, and the shrimp on point. 9/10 (only because I'm used to bigger slices of pork, and chicken). \nNext up Pork arroz chaufa, not greasy and full of flavor. Wasn't overwhelmed with soy sauce, but one of those times where something just happens to be exactly as it should be. 10/10. \nLast but definitely not least the Chijaukay. Just enough soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions and crunch on the chicken. Once again 10/10. \n\nWhat's left? DESERT!!\nWe said well we are 3 for 3 tonight, if they mess this up, I'm ok since the main course was damn near perfect!\n\nPicarones!! We were advised it would take a little longer, since they cook it apart from main course dishes in order to maintain that distinct flavor Picarones have. Maybe 14 mins later, which gave us some time to digest our dinner, they came out pippin hot with authentic miel. Not too thick where the center doesn't cook and is still doughy, and not too thin where they get overcooked quickly, damnit they were perfect! \n\nI am happy to say that we have found our new Peruvian spot that's worth the 45min drive. And maybe not just for Chifa, maybe for everything. Can't wait to visit again. \n\nCompliments to the chef, & Kimberly for her attention to detail when it comes to customer service. Thank you for a wonderful dinner experience. \n\nYes, parking is a pain to find, but when you do, the wait will be worth it! Can't blame the business for that.

For dessert we got alfajores and crema volteada, the alfajor was fresh and pleasant to bite into, and the crema volteada very rich.\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're into authentic Peruvian food, by the way the Peruvian/Chinese dishes looked amazing.\n\nWe'll be back :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-11-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Our Favorites\nChicha Morada\nAnticucho\nLomo saltado \nPicarones\nTallarin verde con Bisteck\n"], "author": "Elena C.", "review": "I'm from Peru and I have tried many Peruvian restaurants in the Bay Area and this is one of the better ones by far. This is not a fancy place, nor is it located in the best part of town. But the food alone is worth coming for. It's authentic and really good, portions are big and prices are very reasonable. Also, one of our friends has eaten at this restaurant 6 times already so she knew all the best dishes in the menu.\n\nOur Favorites\nChicha Morada\nAnticucho\nLomo saltado \nPicarones\nTallarin verde con Bisteck\nArroz con mariscos\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem. I highly recommend El Porteno to anyone who is looking for good authentic Peruvian food.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-11-02"}], "pisco y passion fruit sour": []}
