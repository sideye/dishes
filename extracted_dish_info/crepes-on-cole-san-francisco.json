Before I left the counter I checked on this and the guy got visibly frustrated with me like I was playing some kind of trick on him. I told him I didn't go anywhere and I thought the other person grabbed my number. Not really a huge deal but seriously man... check with your staff before you vent on people. I feel like he gave me weird look when I only put a 10% tip on my check, but that could have just been my impression. If you want more, seriously chill out and show some patience with people.\n\nWhile waiting for the food I saw him repeat this kind of behavior with everyone else in line and figured it was worth mentioning. \n\nSo we waited. And waited. I saw several tables with much larger parties than mine who arrived later get all their food. By the time 40 minutes went by I checked with a blonde server about my order and she said she would go back to the kitchen. Cool, there was hope now.\n\nShe came back out and visited several other tables without saying a word. I gave her another 5-10 minutes before I went up to her and asked about the order. \"YES! I'll bring it to you when it's ready!!\" she impatiently replied. Seriously? I'm being unreasonable here?\n\nIt only takes 10 seconds to let someone know what's going on. It makes them feel better when they've waited a long time and they're hungry. I've worked in a restaurant and I can tell when something goes back as a re-fire because someone forgot the ticket. Customers can be really understanding. But this staff apparently can't even spare a few seconds of politeness. When someone's hungry, it's really the wrong time to be impatient or rude. Especially if you want repeat business.\n\nThe food came out soon after I checked on it and 2 out of 3 of our orders were good. The french toast was great.

We had been playing at the playground at Golden Gate Park when it started raining, so we decided it was time to get some lunch. This was about a brisk one mile walk from the park. When we arrived at about 1pm every table was full. It is a seat yourself kind of place, so we worried for a few minutes about finding someplace that would accomodate our party of six with two kids, one needing a high chair. \n\nCrepes on Cole looks like your typical crepe place right down to the very similar chalk board menus on the wall.

My husband decided to start ordering at the counter without asking if I was ready and my mom and brother were hanging back looking for a table. The guy who was taking orders was very impatient and brusque when I took a second to name what I wanted. I turned to try and wave my mother over to place her order and he was already giving us our total. There was no one else behind us in line, so I thought that was fairly ridiculous. When my mom had to go up and place her order afterwards, he was similarly rude to her when she inquired if they had french fries. \n\nMy brother managed to snag a table while we were ordering and they did have high chairs, so my youngest son had a decent place to sit. After we were seated everything took a turn for the better. The waitresses who dropped off the food were all very friendly and efficient and our food was much better than I have experienced in crepe places in the past. My crepe was large and filled with yummy chicken, pesto, cheese and tomatoes. I loved that it came with both salad and potatoes and I was not forced to just choose one. My boys' grilled cheese sandwiches also came with potatoes and fruit. My mom got a huge salad that looked abundant and very fresh with nice slices of apples, chunks of blue cheese and candied walnuts on top.

They will only hire Hispanic men to work in the kitchen. Why? Because they know they can get away with overworking them and sticking them in a little hole of a kitchen without any ventilation.\n\nThey pay minimum wage with no chance for a raise. And they never, ever pay over time or time and a half (as the law requires). Ever. Even though they make all their employees work on New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and all other major Holidays. Why? Because they know they will be busy because everyone else is closed.\n\nIf you ever have the misfortune of working at this dump, you will be subject to the shorter brother's little temper tantrums, who one day decided to fire me because I had the cook rearrange my breakfast bagel and side of portabello mushrooms  into a sandwich. \n\nWhy, you ask? Because employees are only \"privileged\" to eat crepes with 2 or 3 ingredients not including chicken, avocado and some cheese (I can't remember which), unless they paid for it. And they are not allowed to have a sandwich, unless they pay for it. But we were allowed to have eggs with a bagel and a side of something. So I order the bagel, skip the eggs, with a side of portabello mushrooms, and asked the cook to arrange it as a sandwich instead. \n\nNow, I will admit that the first time I did it was to piss-off that little bitch of an older brother (the shorter on with feminine hands). Unfortunately, that day he was in a good mood and just laughed it off. So I guessed it didn't matter. I ordered my breakfast like that from then on until one when he wasn't in a good mood and he went off. He yelled something about sandwiches not being on the employee menu and that made me laugh.

Their blueberry pancakes are phenomenal, though you may have to request extra syrup- they give you a HUGE portion.
