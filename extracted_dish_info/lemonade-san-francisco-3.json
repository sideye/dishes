The outdoor seating has heat lamps up above that are set at the perfect temperature. You know how sometimes the heat laps elsewhere seem like its burning your head off that when you touch your head your hair is hot? This isnt the case here. Plus..what other restaurant allows you to sample their dishes AND lemonade before purchase?!?! I cant even name one restaurant that permits this. This fact alone blows me away. By sampling your food before you eat, prevents you from ordering something you dont like!! So, all these reviews about this dish being \"just ok\" or not good or whatever... Well buddy. If it wasnt good why did you order it?? You couldve sampled it first. And if you didnt sample and took a chance well you dont know how to use your resources correctly so that is on you. \n\nI highly recommend this place for amazing quality and fresh food. They provide very unique dishes that would take so much time if you tried to replicate yourself. This aint just a grilled chicken cesar salad kind of place. Can you make \"Watermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas and ginger and sesame vinaigrette\"??? Actually Im sure someone can but how long would that take you. Convenience is key in such a busy city. Emphasizing again, quality is great! \n\nThe cucumber mint lemonade is very refreshing. The blood orange lemonade is to die for if you love blood orange. We ordered a lot of food and spent $50 for 2 people.\n\nFrom the Marketplace section:\nWatermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas\nArugula and asian pears\nBLT panzanella\nSmoked salmon\n\nFrom Land & Sea:\nShrimp\nSeared ahi tuna (with orange ginger ponzu on top or on the side)\nTheir special of the day was a curry apple and chicken\n\nFrom the Hot Section:\nBbq brisket\n\nFrom Desserts:\nMacaron- Salted Caramel -- which was huuge. The biggest macaron Ive ever had. It didnt taste like your typical salted caramel though. It wasnt oozing with caramel. To me it tasted more along the lines of a snickerdoodle for some reason. But I still enjoyed it. It wasnt too sweet. There was a lot of filling so you cant cut it with a knife or bite into it like a sandwich because all the filling will come out of the sides. The best way to eat it is with a fork. You are able to control the oozing much better. The macaron is chewy yet soft and very flavorful. \n\nLemonades:\nBlood orange\nCucumber Mint\n\nEvery dish was excellent. We sampled everything we ordered so Im not going into detail on how well each dish tasted. They were all good. The macaron was not typical so that info I had to share.\n\nThis place is worth a try. I promise you wont regret it. The lemonade alone will bring me back every time. I'll be back again for sure.

We came on a sunny Saturday afternoon around 4pm following a trip to the SFMOMA a block away. A greeter explained the concept and menu to us after we entered. If you are looking to order food to-go, you go straight to the register to order. However if you want to eat in, you get in line at the food bar and order all your food a la carte. True to the cafeteria-style concept, grab your tray and then pick the items you want. The stations include: Marketplace (hearty denser savory salads), Leafy Greens (salad...), Land and Sea (fish, chicken, beef), Sandwiches (which get delivered to your table), and Hot Dishes (pasta, bbq, and specials). At the register you can order desert and drinks (specialty lemonade).  At the time we went, the restaurant wasn't crowded at all, and we moved through the line fairly quickly. However, I could definitely imagine this place being more stressful to navigate during the lunchtime rush hour.\n\nWe tasted the pickled watermelon radish and seared ahi tuna salad, the BLT panzanella, and the roasted cauliflower, all of which were fantastic and well-seasoned. We also tried the baked buttermilk chicken sandwich, which was a little dry I thought and ended up being too much food. In the future, 2 marketplace sides and a protein or hot dish would probably be a solid lunch. \n\nAmbience-wise, this spot definitely exudes SoCal coolness. There is ample indoor and outdoor sitting. We sat on the patio since it was such a nice day.  This place is great for lunch with friends or a date after doing some shopping or sightseeing downtown.

It reminds me of the prepared food counters at Whole Foods.  Everything looks so pretty, sounds fancy, is a tad pricey but tastes kinda mediocre.  For about $25 (after tax and health surcharge) I got two fish items, one side and a drink.  I don't mind dropping some cash for a nice lunch, but I feel like there are better places to spend that money in the SoMa/FiDi area.\n\nAhi Tuna Poke: Poke seems to be the hottest trending it food in San Francisco now, so there is some stiff competition.  The avocado made the poke more pasty than juicy.  It also offset the kick you get from ingredients such as garlic.  Overall, it tasted a bit too mild for me.  The tuna chunks were large, however, they were a little tougher than I've had elsewhere.\n\nAvocado Salmon Louie: Very cool presentation.  Salmon mixed with all sorts of flavoring and presented in half of an avocado.  I really liked the dill; always a classic salmon pairing.  It was fun to eat, having to dig into the avocado after getting some salmon on your fork.  Probably my favorite of the items I got.\n\nTruffle Mac 'n Cheese: Biggest flaw was that the noodles were quite soggy instead of al dente, making a huge texture faux pas.  They were very heavy on the white peppercorn and pretty light on the truffle.  There was ample cheese sauce though.  Would have been nice if they had some crusty gratin\u00e9ed cheese or breadcrumbs to add a crunchy texture.\n\nGuava Limeade: I'm a huge guava fan, so had to get this one.  It was definitely stronger on the lime side than the guava side.  And more tart than sweet.

And here I was, thinking they were all about lemonade, like Hot Dog on a Stick (minus the giant stomper thing they use to juice the lemons).\n\nSince I wasn't all that familiar with Lemonade (obviously), I didn't really know what to expect the first time I came here.  Their set-up was a little confusing initially, but I actually liked how you can walk up directly to each station rather than work your way down a line cafeteria-style (though perhaps not during the lunch rush).

Ive heard so much about their LA location that I could not wait until they opened here. First let me say that a lot of reviews complain about the price. Well, quality comes with a price. That should be a fact everyone knows. Id like to say thats common sense, but common sense is not common. In SF, everything good has a price. If our standard of living here is amongst the highest, why did anyone think that this place would be \"cheap\". If you expect \"cheap\" salad go to Fresh Choice with absolutely no quality at all. Im just saying. \n\nThis place has excellent customer service. Amazing, fresh and delicious food. Indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has heat lamps up above that are set at the perfect temperature. You know how sometimes the heat laps elsewhere seem like its burning your head off that when you touch your head your hair is hot? This isnt the case here. Plus..what other restaurant allows you to sample their dishes AND lemonade before purchase?!?! I cant even name one restaurant that permits this. This fact alone blows me away. By sampling your food before you eat, prevents you from ordering something you dont like!! So, all these reviews about this dish being \"just ok\" or not good or whatever... Well buddy. If it wasnt good why did you order it?? You couldve sampled it first. And if you didnt sample and took a chance well you dont know how to use your resources correctly so that is on you. \n\nI highly recommend this place for amazing quality and fresh food. They provide very unique dishes that would take so much time if you tried to replicate yourself. This aint just a grilled chicken cesar salad kind of place.

The biggest macaron Ive ever had. It didnt taste like your typical salted caramel though. It wasnt oozing with caramel. To me it tasted more along the lines of a snickerdoodle for some reason. But I still enjoyed it. It wasnt too sweet. There was a lot of filling so you cant cut it with a knife or bite into it like a sandwich because all the filling will come out of the sides. The best way to eat it is with a fork. You are able to control the oozing much better. The macaron is chewy yet soft and very flavorful. \n\nLemonades:\nBlood orange\nCucumber Mint\n\nEvery dish was excellent.

I was really excited to take full advantage of the samples, and try new, fresh foods. However, it was completely packed when I walked in, making it very difficult to ask for samples, as they were busy and it seemed rude to hold up the line, so I had just one sample. I'm glad I got it, because I ended up not getting the Catavelli Pasta. It didn't seem like anything special, just your everyday pasta salad with olives and tomatoes. \n\nOf course after spending so much time researching, I had to get the Watermelon Radish and Grilled Tuna. I was sadly underwhelmed. It was quite salty, probably due to the seasonings they used for the tuna, but the tuna was wonderful quality, and I got quite a lot. The snap peas added a nice crunch to the dish, but were also sometimes bitter, which made the dish both salty and bitter (like me after I spent $3 on it). I also definitely got more of this than the other marketplace item I ordered, because it was in a very small to-go box.\n\nOn a whim I also got the BLT Panzanella, which I'm pretty sure I pronounced wrong when asking for it. I loved everything about it in my first bite. The turkey is moist, the avocado was fresh, the tomatoes were sweet, and the bread pieces soaked up the vinaigrette, which added a perfect tartness to the dish. And then I had a bite with the purple lettuce and a part of me died on the inside. It was more bitter than anything I've ever tasted, and I love bitter melon. It was worth it to me to pick out the five or so pieces of lettuce to enjoy the rest of the salad. I wish it came with more avocado, though, but maybe that depends on you scoop and random selection.\n\nI had planned to get the mac and cheese and was delighted to find out they do a half and half of the Traditional and the Truffle. The server accidentally packed me a full truffle one, but he happily packaged a new mixed one for me once he realized his mistake. The cup was so full he couldn't even put the lid on, which is really a bang for my 4.5 bucks! I could have had just the mac alone and been full. The traditional mac was plain, as expected. The truffle mac was very cheesy, the strings followed my fork everywhere it went. I definitely think it tasted more buttery and just made me warm and happy inside. \n\nThe lemonades were interesting. I sampled their blueberry mint, old fashioned, and watermelon rosemary, and ended up getting the former. The watermelon rosemary seemed watered down, in the way an unripe watermelon tastes.

The blueberry mint tasted neither like blueberries or mint, but it was the sweetest of the three (but this does not mean it wasn't very sour). \n\nThe desserts looked very very tempting, but with my meal coming out to be almost $16, I had to say no thank you and hope I could come back next time.

The dream gets even better because we will be blessed with not one, but SIX Bay Area locations total. \n\nIt does get a bit overwhelming here, especially if it's your first time. There's a plethora of options: marketplace, land & sea, salad & sandwiches, hot dishes, dessert and of course lemonade, but you only need to know one thing: WATERMELON RADISH AND SEARED AHI TUNA from the marketplace.

I tried 5 (yes 5!) different menu items before landing on my selections. Everything I tasted was amazing. The poke was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth perfect. The truffle mac was out of this world. The pasta salad with kalamata olives & feta was unreal. Aaaand then if that wasn't great enough, the lemonade itself. The namesake. Good lord, 5 options?! But, I knew as soon as I saw the cucumber mint that my heart would belong to no other. So I ordered my beverage without second thought and then rushed to a table to pig out on my feast for one. \n\nPros: Tons of options, clearly labeled veg/vegan selections, unlimited sampling of menu items, friendly staff, clean location, DELICIOUS FOOD!\n\nCons: Everything is way too enticing...

Ive heard so much about their LA location that I could not wait until they opened here. First let me say that a lot of reviews complain about the price. Well, quality comes with a price. That should be a fact everyone knows. Id like to say thats common sense, but common sense is not common. In SF, everything good has a price. If our standard of living here is amongst the highest, why did anyone think that this place would be \"cheap\". If you expect \"cheap\" salad go to Fresh Choice with absolutely no quality at all. Im just saying. \n\nThis place has excellent customer service. Amazing, fresh and delicious food. Indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has heat lamps up above that are set at the perfect temperature. You know how sometimes the heat laps elsewhere seem like its burning your head off that when you touch your head your hair is hot? This isnt the case here. Plus..what other restaurant allows you to sample their dishes AND lemonade before purchase?!?! I cant even name one restaurant that permits this. This fact alone blows me away. By sampling your food before you eat, prevents you from ordering something you dont like!! So, all these reviews about this dish being \"just ok\" or not good or whatever... Well buddy. If it wasnt good why did you order it?? You couldve sampled it first. And if you didnt sample and took a chance well you dont know how to use your resources correctly so that is on you. \n\nI highly recommend this place for amazing quality and fresh food. They provide very unique dishes that would take so much time if you tried to replicate yourself. This aint just a grilled chicken cesar salad kind of place. Can you make \"Watermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas and ginger and sesame vinaigrette\"??? Actually Im sure someone can but how long would that take you. Convenience is key in such a busy city. Emphasizing again, quality is great! \n\nThe cucumber mint lemonade is very refreshing. The blood orange lemonade is to die for if you love blood orange. We ordered a lot of food and spent $50 for 2 people.\n\nFrom the Marketplace section:\nWatermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas\nArugula and asian pears\nBLT panzanella\nSmoked salmon\n\nFrom Land & Sea:\nShrimp\nSeared ahi tuna (with orange ginger ponzu on top or on the side)\nTheir special of the day was a curry apple and chicken\n\nFrom the Hot Section:\nBbq brisket\n\nFrom Desserts:\nMacaron- Salted Caramel -- which was huuge. The biggest macaron Ive ever had. It didnt taste like your typical salted caramel though. It wasnt oozing with caramel. To me it tasted more along the lines of a snickerdoodle for some reason. But I still enjoyed it. It wasnt too sweet. There was a lot of filling so you cant cut it with a knife or bite into it like a sandwich because all the filling will come out of the sides. The best way to eat it is with a fork. You are able to control the oozing much better. The macaron is chewy yet soft and very flavorful. \n\nLemonades:\nBlood orange\nCucumber Mint\n\nEvery dish was excellent. We sampled everything we ordered so Im not going into detail on how well each dish tasted. They were all good. The macaron was not typical so that info I had to share.\n\nThis place is worth a try.

Once my friend and I were in the door, someone working at Lemonade handed us a menu. We were both pretty surprised to see how many options they had. There were quite a few sections: the marketplace (small salads and sides), greens (entree sized salads), land and sea (different protein items), hot dishes, desserts, and of course lemonade! The menu also featured a nice little combo deal! It offered two items from the marketplace and one item from the land and sea section for only $12.75. This seemed like the best option for me. Another nice thing is that you can taste anything you want! Just gotta ask! This is probably why the line is so long! The Hawaiian poke was pretty good. After my friend and I got all of our food, we were told we could skip the other sections and go straight to pay. It felt weird to \"cut\" the line but no one else seemed to notice. We each got a lemonade. There were so many choices! After tasting a few, I chose the cucumber mint lemonade and it was delicious! It was a generous serving of probably 24 oz? 32 oz?

I was really excited to take full advantage of the samples, and try new, fresh foods. However, it was completely packed when I walked in, making it very difficult to ask for samples, as they were busy and it seemed rude to hold up the line, so I had just one sample. I'm glad I got it, because I ended up not getting the Catavelli Pasta. It didn't seem like anything special, just your everyday pasta salad with olives and tomatoes. \n\nOf course after spending so much time researching, I had to get the Watermelon Radish and Grilled Tuna. I was sadly underwhelmed. It was quite salty, probably due to the seasonings they used for the tuna, but the tuna was wonderful quality, and I got quite a lot. The snap peas added a nice crunch to the dish, but were also sometimes bitter, which made the dish both salty and bitter (like me after I spent $3 on it). I also definitely got more of this than the other marketplace item I ordered, because it was in a very small to-go box.\n\nOn a whim I also got the BLT Panzanella, which I'm pretty sure I pronounced wrong when asking for it. I loved everything about it in my first bite. The turkey is moist, the avocado was fresh, the tomatoes were sweet, and the bread pieces soaked up the vinaigrette, which added a perfect tartness to the dish. And then I had a bite with the purple lettuce and a part of me died on the inside. It was more bitter than anything I've ever tasted, and I love bitter melon. It was worth it to me to pick out the five or so pieces of lettuce to enjoy the rest of the salad. I wish it came with more avocado, though, but maybe that depends on you scoop and random selection.\n\nI had planned to get the mac and cheese and was delighted to find out they do a half and half of the Traditional and the Truffle. The server accidentally packed me a full truffle one, but he happily packaged a new mixed one for me once he realized his mistake. The cup was so full he couldn't even put the lid on, which is really a bang for my 4.5 bucks! I could have had just the mac alone and been full. The traditional mac was plain, as expected. The truffle mac was very cheesy, the strings followed my fork everywhere it went. I definitely think it tasted more buttery and just made me warm and happy inside. \n\nThe lemonades were interesting. I sampled their blueberry mint, old fashioned, and watermelon rosemary, and ended up getting the former. The watermelon rosemary seemed watered down, in the way an unripe watermelon tastes. It would be a good option for those seeking a less intense lemonade.

"], "author": "Brittany D.", "review": "I'm always reminded of Beyonce when I think of Lemonade. Too bad unlike her album, this place left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nTbh, we settled on Lemonade because the Super Duper Burger line was seemingly endless. Aside from the short line, eating at Lemonade was a poor decision. The restaurant was out of nearly half of their featured menu to the point where my boyfriend ended up settling for the truffle mac&cheese (his 4th choice). Some of you may argue that this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when there aren't enough appealing entree options available forcing you to settle on a side, I beg to disagree. I hoped that since it was a Saturday evening, there would be an overflow of food options given that this is a bustling city and it was dinner time. I was wrong. To my dismay, I even had to settle for a less desired option myself. \n\nWhat went wrong? As for one of the reasons given to me by the shift supervisor, the wrong chicken was ordered for the mango chicken bowl that my boyfriend initially wanted. They only had enough from a prior batch to feed a small subset of people. This, I let slide but for 2 more entrees to be unavailable that evening, it was clear to me that mismanagement was a deep-seeded issue. The supervisor on duty also mentioned that employees called in sick, reducing their staffing. I know that the holidays are a busy time for everyone, but I think they could have anticipated for it. It showed in their lack of cleanliness and organization. I was appalled by the sight of dirty dishes left on tables and the messiness of the food serving areas. I think based on this alone, I was being generous when I gave them 2 stars. \n\nAs far as the food goes, I couldn't even take more than 2 bites out of mine. I originally requested for the \"original\" poke bowl with ahi tuna, rice and seaweed. Unsurprisingly, they ran out of that, so I went for the spicy option. **HOT TIP** I would recommend sampling something first if you're unsure of the dish. I did just that and realized it wasn't that spicy so I decided to order the spicy poke bowl. I disliked it for several reasons: the rice was soggy, the coconut chips didn't complement the dish well imo, and the fish didn't taste fresh (how could it be when it was sitting out in the open all day behind a glass shield?). Never again will I order this dish. I could get fresher poke and better-tasting add-ons at a nearby poke joint for the price of this one ($11.50) or cheaper. My boyfriend first wanted the mango chicken bowl, which they didn't have. Then, he asked for 2 more meat entrees, which they ran out of as well. That's when he was left to order the truffle mac&cheese, which I'm glad he did because that was what I ended up eating in the end. I think the other redeeming quality of this meal was the blood orange lemonade-- not too sweet or sour. It was a pretty good balance. \n\nI guess I had high expectations after visiting the Palo Alto location, but they were hardly met at this one.

It's just okay to me. \n\nI will say that for a business operating on opening day, the line kept moving quickly and the flow of things were much smoother than other places that open their doors to the public on the first day. However, it was still quite a hectic time trying to navigate through the different booths for food. From what I understand, you start off in the \"marketplace\" where you choose your vegan/vegetarian foods, and as you make your way up the line, you can get \"Land and Sea\" foods (meat and seafood), sandwiches, hot dishes (rice, mac n cheese, rotisserie meats, chili, etc), and dessert. When you arrive at the counter, that's where you can opt to get your lemonade drink(s). \n\nOn opening day, I opted for 3 dishes and one of their lemonades: \n\nSoba Noodles & Kimchi Vegetables - Soba noodles were very cold and refreshing, and had a good texture to them. There was a nice twist to the kimchi vegetables, as they were not red nor particularly spicy. I guess that's just to please the palette of the average person who has yet to be graced by the flavor of the red kimchi the Koreans are known for. Anyway, nice dish! \n\nLemongrass Chicken Slaw - I didn't like this one too much, mainly because the \"Szechuan vinaigrette\"...didn't taste like Szechuan cuisine (i.e. not spicy). It also did not have a particular \"lemongrass\" taste to it, which was disappointing. \n\nSeared Ahi Tuna - Tuna was fresh, had no smell to it, and the crushed orange ginger ponzu dipping sauce is a surprisingly nice complement to it. \n\nBlood orange lemonade - If you don't like tangy aftertastes, go for this one. However, it kind of walks the line between \"too sweet\" and \"just right\". I have a feeling the other lemonades will be the same. \n\nAnyway, it's worth a try!

Ive heard so much about their LA location that I could not wait until they opened here. First let me say that a lot of reviews complain about the price. Well, quality comes with a price. That should be a fact everyone knows. Id like to say thats common sense, but common sense is not common. In SF, everything good has a price. If our standard of living here is amongst the highest, why did anyone think that this place would be \"cheap\". If you expect \"cheap\" salad go to Fresh Choice with absolutely no quality at all. Im just saying. \n\nThis place has excellent customer service. Amazing, fresh and delicious food. Indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has heat lamps up above that are set at the perfect temperature. You know how sometimes the heat laps elsewhere seem like its burning your head off that when you touch your head your hair is hot? This isnt the case here. Plus..what other restaurant allows you to sample their dishes AND lemonade before purchase?!?! I cant even name one restaurant that permits this. This fact alone blows me away. By sampling your food before you eat, prevents you from ordering something you dont like!! So, all these reviews about this dish being \"just ok\" or not good or whatever... Well buddy. If it wasnt good why did you order it?? You couldve sampled it first. And if you didnt sample and took a chance well you dont know how to use your resources correctly so that is on you. \n\nI highly recommend this place for amazing quality and fresh food. They provide very unique dishes that would take so much time if you tried to replicate yourself. This aint just a grilled chicken cesar salad kind of place. Can you make \"Watermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas and ginger and sesame vinaigrette\"??? Actually Im sure someone can but how long would that take you. Convenience is key in such a busy city. Emphasizing again, quality is great! \n\nThe cucumber mint lemonade is very refreshing. The blood orange lemonade is to die for if you love blood orange. We ordered a lot of food and spent $50 for 2 people.\n\nFrom the Marketplace section:\nWatermelon radish & seared ahi tuna with snap peas\nArugula and asian pears\nBLT panzanella\nSmoked salmon\n\nFrom Land & Sea:\nShrimp\nSeared ahi tuna (with orange ginger ponzu on top or on the side)\nTheir special of the day was a curry apple and chicken\n\nFrom the Hot Section:\nBbq brisket\n\nFrom Desserts:\nMacaron- Salted Caramel -- which was huuge. The biggest macaron Ive ever had. It didnt taste like your typical salted caramel though. It wasnt oozing with caramel. To me it tasted more along the lines of a snickerdoodle for some reason. But I still enjoyed it. It wasnt too sweet. There was a lot of filling so you cant cut it with a knife or bite into it like a sandwich because all the filling will come out of the sides. The best way to eat it is with a fork. You are able to control the oozing much better. The macaron is chewy yet soft and very flavorful. \n\nLemonades:\nBlood orange\nCucumber Mint\n\nEvery dish was excellent. We sampled everything we ordered so Im not going into detail on how well each dish tasted. They were all good. The macaron was not typical so that info I had to share.\n\nThis place is worth a try. I promise you wont regret it. The lemonade alone will bring me back every time. I'll be back again for sure.

Some of my friends, on the other hand, were rather stoked to have another light and fresh option for lunch downtown.  And here I was, thinking they were all about lemonade, like Hot Dog on a Stick (minus the giant stomper thing they use to juice the lemons).\n\nSince I wasn't all that familiar with Lemonade (obviously), I didn't really know what to expect the first time I came here.  Their set-up was a little confusing initially, but I actually liked how you can walk up directly to each station rather than work your way down a line cafeteria-style (though perhaps not during the lunch rush).  Especially since the two times I've been here, I was able to skip the cold selections and go straight to their sandwiches!\n\n-- GANDOLFINI - Turkey, Chicken, Ham, Swiss, Pepperoncini, and Olives...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=4nn8NdESKCDqal0NG6bpAQ)\nI knew immediately I wanted to try this when I saw it.  The ingredients may not be super unique, but it looked so good!  There was a decent amount of all three meats, the cheese was uber gooey, andI liked the bitterness of the arugula.  Even the olives weren't too shabby.  I especially liked the bread though, which was soft and just lightly toasted.\n\n-- AHI TUNA & AVOCADO POKE with Tangerines, Icicle Radish, and Sesame...$6.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=op5-6NIDedN0cRZQlJoFCA)\nI figured it was going to be overpriced (and it was, based on the portion size), but I had been craving some poke pretty badly.  While it wasn't super flawed, I thought it was just okay. The tuna was pretty fresh, as were the rest of the ingredients, but I didn't care much for the sauce the used, which was fairly sharp/acidic.\n\n-- BLOOD ORANGE LEMONADE...$3.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=Fn9_wmUJErYOj8c50jKhPw)\nI was torn between this one and their regular lemonade, but the girl at the register mentioned this was her favorite.  After just a couple of sips, I could definitely see why!  While it's a little sweet, I liked the overall taste, as well as the bit of tartness from the blood orange.\n\n-- GUAVA LIMEADE...$3.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=EnTAQ5TKfndHQlB3GoZU9Q)\nI would've ordered the Blood Orange Lemonade again, but I had to try this one for the guava.  Unlike the lemonade, this was more sour than sweet, though I was fine with that (it's limeade, after all).  I do wish there was a bit more guava to it, but I'd definitely get this again!\n\n-- TURKEY \"EL TIJUANA\" with Jicama Slaw, Queso Fresco, Avocado, and Jalapeno Aioli...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=Gglr5xYcf9TDwVeC0W_N6A)\nNot as tasty as the Gandolfini, but solid nonetheless.  The turkey, queso fresco, and avocado blended well together, the bread was just as good, and the jalapenos and aioli were great (the heat wasn't super intense).  The jicama slaw didn't do much for me (it didn't add a lot of flavor), but it did provide a nice, refreshing crunch.\n\n-- WHITE TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE...$4.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-3?select=SmsZULk0SzEnjqL5XFVmmw)\nDespite how I wish the consistency of the sauce was gooier/cheesier, this was great!  The noodles were were perfectly tender and there was a good amount of truffle flavor in the dish.  Something like toasted breadcrumbs would be nice to add some texture, but it's a minor quibble.\n\nWhile I can't say how this Lemonade compares to its brethren in LA, it does seem like the prices here are a shade higher based on the online menu's on their homepage.  However, even with that in mind, I'm more inclined to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS since I haven't had any major problems with them.

For about $25 (after tax and health surcharge) I got two fish items, one side and a drink.  I don't mind dropping some cash for a nice lunch, but I feel like there are better places to spend that money in the SoMa/FiDi area.\n\nAhi Tuna Poke: Poke seems to be the hottest trending it food in San Francisco now, so there is some stiff competition.  The avocado made the poke more pasty than juicy.  It also offset the kick you get from ingredients such as garlic.  Overall, it tasted a bit too mild for me.  The tuna chunks were large, however, they were a little tougher than I've had elsewhere.\n\nAvocado Salmon Louie: Very cool presentation.  Salmon mixed with all sorts of flavoring and presented in half of an avocado.  I really liked the dill; always a classic salmon pairing.  It was fun to eat, having to dig into the avocado after getting some salmon on your fork.  Probably my favorite of the items I got.\n\nTruffle Mac 'n Cheese: Biggest flaw was that the noodles were quite soggy instead of al dente, making a huge texture faux pas.  They were very heavy on the white peppercorn and pretty light on the truffle.  There was ample cheese sauce though.  Would have been nice if they had some crusty gratin\u00e9ed cheese or breadcrumbs to add a crunchy texture.\n\nGuava Limeade: I'm a huge guava fan, so had to get this one.

The Pineapple Chicken is reminiscent of a healthier version Kung Pao Chicken dish which has the tangy flavor from their dressing yet sweet from the pineapple. The toasted coconut also gives it the perfect crunch. The New Mexican Roasted Butternut is my favorite mainly because it's good and second because I love corn.\n\nAs for Land and Sea, you can never go wrong with their Avocado Salmon Louie or Roasted Chicken.

I was not handed a menu or anything (and it was my first time at a Lemonade) so I wasn't familiar with the concept and ended up over ordering.\n\nI hope that they open up a location closer to my workplace to help me stay on track for summer body 2016! ;)", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-02"}, {"excerpts": ["I also ordered the guava limeade.

Love the ambiance, its bright and perky. Love the Yellow everywhere. It's really great for anyone who wants quick & healthy food. It's also reasonably priced. Very delicious and fresh.

There are sections of marketplace, leafy greens, land and sea, sandwiches, and hot dishes. You are encouraged to mix and match between the categories to make your meal. There are so many options in each of the categories that it can be overwhelming to make a decision, something that I don't like. There are about 30 options to choose from. Add that with the lunch crowd, confusing layout, and there is a large amount of confused people in a little area. The choices displayed looked good and I chose a buttermilk baked chicken sandwich with a side of truffle mac and cheese. To drink I opted for the carrot ginger juice and my meal was about $18. The sandwich was ok. The bread was thick and dry, but the chicken was tasty. The truffle mac had good flavor, but the noodles were overcooked and mushy. All in all the meal was ok and definitely not worth the cost. \n\nBut the staff are very friendly and accommodating to new diners. They help walk you through the process and will answer your questions. You are also encouraged to sample the dishes as you move along, which is nice to help decide what you order. The indoor seating can get crowded and clustered since it is right next to the food area, but the outdoor seating is open and airy.
