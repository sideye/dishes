So I'm hopeful that they can manage to iron out some minor issues with food service, explained below.\n\nObviously since the place is new, it's nicer and cleaner than the location on Valencia street. They've kept the layout and decor from the previous tenant Baraka. So they also inherited the same design flaw, a one person bathroom (back right corner, next to private dining table). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunflower-potrero-hill-san-francisco?select=MtM9OVSb2d0BeihKN-WDXA#MtM9OVSb2d0BeihKN-WDXA Might be a long wait for the bathroom, when the restaurant is full. You've been warned.\n\nOverall the food is good (note that I prefer the Vietnamese places on Larkin street). \n\nThe one flaw that I saw with food service was the inability of the kitchen to keep up with orders with a half full restaurant. Also they couldn't deliver all the food for a table at the same time. I saw 4 or 5 tables were only one person had their plate, while their companion was still waiting for food. Apparently the kitchen was not checking the ticket orders, and just making whatever dishes were easier to make.\n\nIn my case, they took a long time to make my BBQ pork combination. While 2 tables that came after me got their food first (they had noodle soup bowls and crispy egg noodles).

Later someone found it after most of the orders were gone, and got the soup person to complete the set. Therefore, I can only conclude that they have a very disorganized kitchen.

I make every effort to patronize all the restaurants encompassed around my zip code area.  I went for lunch yesterday, Sunday, 3/29 and ordered the appetizer combination which includes the Vietnamese spring rolls.  It also includes strips of pork, prawns, and raw or marinated veggies.  I have tried other menu items, but I am fed up pretending this restaurant of cooks and its owner(s) know, or willing to cook authentic Vietnamese food.  They take way too many inexpensive shortcuts which fools other customers who have no previous gastronomical or hands on cultural experience in Vietnamese cuisine.  I do, so I know the difference.  \n\nThis restaurant serves what should pass for fast food taste style version.  No culturally proud authentic traditional Vietnamese cook or chef would ever use canned pineapple as a menu ingredient.  Even the rice paper, used to encase bits of food, roll around like a cigar and dip into fish sauce, was so thin that it could not be removed from the plastic plate holding each one.  The food is boring including the broths. Obviously, this restaurant caters to customers with unsophisticated palates simply happy to brag that they had a menu with the word Vietnamese.  I took the diplomatic step to ask the waitress if the cooks were Chinese trained to cook Vietnamese.  She replied they were all Vietnamese.  However, the few times I have been there, I am pretty sure I recognize Chinese language being spoken by the wait staff and cooks.  I worked alongside of Vietnamese diplomats and several Vietnamese refugees at the time, when I was assigned to a Vietnamese embassy for almost four years, so II do know the difference there too. I am city born with Hispanic heritage but traveled and associated with an expansive range of cultural leaders and culinary professionals to know when food is fusion, traditional, or just diluted to appease those content with thinking they ate something culturally authentic.\n\nSunflower Restaurant must presume that nonVietnamese residents of this part of the city are too culturally naive to know the difference and they are probably accurate. I doubt this restaurant can fool anyone serving overseas before the communist took over all of Vietnam and the Vietnamese themselves or those of us with close links in various capacities with the Vietnamese community.   Many previous Vietnamese restaurants in other parts of town tried to appease the middle of the road Americanized  palate, but most of those don't last long in business. Fortunately, aside from a handful of us in Potrero Hill and surrounding neighborhoods, most remote from the 1970's introduction of Vietnamese culture and cuisine into the U.S. have a very sparse point of reference which Sunflower Restaurant hopes will be the common factor in serving unimpressive, boring rendition of Vietnamese food.
