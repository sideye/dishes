Horrible suki-yaki, jive ass rolls, and nigiri.\nBack in the day this was the more famous Japanese restaurant in the area, and pre-Yelp nobody else knew where to go nearby.\n\nJessica T is right. Ebisu and San Tung are the only restaurants in the area that always have lines. The only difference with me is that I will go back, no, CRAWL back,  to San Tung in a heartbeat and am willing to line up for their five spices beef noodle soup (apologies if some of you don't like it, but this was a favorite of my late father's when we used to spend Saturdays at the original hole in the wall location), spicy honey garlic chicken wings, and of course the boiled pork and cabbage dumpling goodness.\nI've always walked out happy at San Tung, even at its current location #2 that doesn't quite taste the same as the former #1.\n\nIf sitting at the sushi bar only and getting the original old #1 sushi chef serving you is the only way to enjoy a visit here, then it is not worth my time. Especially when Koo is just a stone's throw away where Kiyoshi-san's craft and ingenuity can easily give you improvisational multiple orgasms while jazz music is playing in the background.\n\nSo anyway, I'm in a foul mood today. \n\nLooky at the restaurant's website and their online menu:\n\nAppetizer: Matzoh Ball - Fresh ground fish with spices and deep fried. Oy vey, this is so wrong. What is a deep fried fish ball with a Kosher/Jewish food name doing here? If I were hard core Jewish, I'd rather be banned from the synagogue for eating nigiri laced with crab, scallops, and oysters, than eating a deep fried fish ball called Matzoh (and not in chicken soup either). OK I take that back, deep fried fishball is ok so long as it is skewered and served in a Hong Kong style curry sauce....\n\n------OOOOOO (accept no substitutes)\n\nMud Pie 7.00  (Sea urchin tempura) - this sounds so wrong. Inside the sea urchin, inbetween the yellowy golden brown lobes of gonads are some dark black yucky stuff. Perhaps if the stuff is tempura fried then the name mud pie would be apt.\n\nLunch: \nSashimi $9.50 - Fresh raw filet of tuna | soy sauce | Japanese green mustard. I thought wasabi was a horseradish kinda thing, or a root. Japanese mustard is karashi and yellow brown. \n \nSushi:\nTORA fatty white/red tuna seasonal.

Negi-ba? \n\nEBISU MAKI salmon with vegetables 5.50 - OXYMORON, when they explain in ABOUT US, that Ebisu himself in the restaurant logo,  holds a fishing rod and a sea bream (tai).

Lately, since the closure of its sister restaurant across the street, Hotei, Ebisu has been completely full by 5:30 pm on weekends, so to avoid waiting for up to an hour for a table or bar seats to open up, I have had to get there by 4:45 (it opens at 5:00) and put my name on a list for bar seats.  It is worth the wait, though, as it has always had consistently excellent, fresh sushi.  As a long-time patron I have come to know the owner, Steve Fujii.  He has introduced me to some amazing new special dishes and appetizers which have become favorites.  His lobster dynamite, served in three large oyster shells, is fabulous.  The tempuras are fantastic, with light, non-greasy crisp batter coating farmer's market vegetables, fresh shrimp, or my favorite, squid tempura.  My dinner companion loves the panko fried oysters, cooked to perfection.  I prefer the fried shrimp heads that come with the ama ebi order, and also the pan-fried sand dab, especially if the whole fish is small enough to fit on the plate.  Other great dishes include the sake-steamed clams (also available with mussels), and grilled teriyaki scallops wrapped in bacon and served with an amazing red hot sauce.\n\nSince I always sit at the sushi bar, that is what I mainly order.  Sometimes the chefs have specials that are only available for a short time, such as house-made pickled smelt, which are eaten whole.  The last time I was there, the chef prepared halibut fin sashimi dribbled with small bits of monk fish liver and shredded shiso leaves in a mild miso sauce which was to die for.  The seafood salad is also wonderful, made with several types of fish, seaweed, and pickled vegetables, with chunks of mountain potato.  This and other sushi dishes can be modified to your specifications and the chefs will also make anything you can think of, as well as creating their own surprise dishes on the spot.

This is quite possibly my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco. I almost didn't go to Ebisu as my friend asked, but then my Hinge date bailed on me so I didn't feel guilty about trying a new Asian place near where my friend lives. \n\nFirst off, location: good location in the Inner Sunset, near UCSF Parnassus and some Metro Muni lines. I haven't spent much time in that neighborhood but really liked the vibes I got from walking around before and after dinner. \n\nSecondly: lines. My friend and I got there just before 6 on a Friday night and were seated immediately. Shortly after, a large line appeared and people were waiting both inside and outside! Luckily there's lots of cute shops to explore in if you have to wait. \n\nThirdly, the food: the best part. There were so many cold and hot appetizers to choose from, so many entrees, so many sushi dishes, and specialty rolls, my friend and I spent a good 15-20 minutes figuring out what to order. We decided to split everything: the 49er roll, kakuni, 1-2 person Omakase, and matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nThe 49er roll had salmon, avocado, tobiko, shiso, and lemon. We were hesitant to try it due to the lemon but it worked! It was a thin slice and brought a unique tang to the roll that I wouldn't recommend for everyone, but I enjoyed it. We did not try the Dexter Carter but had considered it. \n\nThe kakuni appetizer was TO DIE FOR. The fatty pork belly tasted caramelized, and, like the 49er roll with lemon, fruity due to a satsuma sauce. 10/10 would recommend the kakuni. \n\nThe omakase for 1-2 people was plenty for us! It came with tuna, salmon, butterfish, yellowtail, amberjack, and halibut. The butterfish and amberjack were surprisingly perfect (they were the pale-colored ones I think), but they were all good and fresh and hearty slices. I believe each one came with 3 slices each. It was filling and well-worth $28! \n\nEven though my friend and I were stuffed, we went ahead and tried the matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The wait and trip out to the Inner Sunset would be worth it just for this unique dish. There was a thick layer of mousse beneath the crispy burnt top layer. The bottom layers were colder than that layer on top. It came with a thin shortbread-like cookie with matcha filling that was alright--the main focus was on flipping matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! A must-order. \n\nLastly, service: some other reviews here said service wasn't very good or professional, which was the opposite of my experience. Everyone working there was calm, knowledgeable (I asked which sashimi was what at least three times), warm, and kept filling up my water cup! They politely and discreetly tried to get us to leave to flip the table by giving us the check early and asking if we wanted dessert when we still had some sashimi left on our plates, which is to be expected. \n\nBathrooms could be cleaner but they are gender-neutral. \n\nTLDR: amazing restaurant with great service. Order the kakuni and matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, as well as a specialty sushi roll.

This will be a super long review since we went all out :)\n\nCame here on a Saturday around 6:30pm, waited about 45 minutes for a table for 4. The hostess in charge of the waitlist seemed grumpy (at least she was equally indifferent to everyone I guess....).\n\nOnce seated, the food was served very quickly after we ordered and the waitresses were really nice and friendly. \n\nAppetizers:\nKobe (Beef) Sashimi -3.5 stars- always heard about this raw beef sashimi but never actually tried it, wasn't sure if I would able to stomach raw meat but it was fine! The meat was unsalted, soft and chewy. It came with a small plate of soy sauce, which was good, and three types of spicy sauce, which I did not like so I skipped.\n\nSake Steamed Mussels -4 stars- I really liked this appetizer but it was very salty. I liked the flavors in the soup containing a leafy green (spinach?), shiitake mushrooms and dried scallops in a sake/soy sauce soup base I think. Glad we made the switch to mussels based on the waitress's recommendation, she said it has a bigger portion than the clams.\n\nGindara (Sake kasu marinated black cod) -5 stars- almost missed this gem! Very tasty, the fish practically melts in your mouth, the smooth garlicky (sake kasu) sauce was also very good. This was definitely our favorite appetizer/dish of the night. The only unfortunate part was the small portion size since it was an appetizer, we had to savor every last piece \n\nOyster Dynamite -4.5 stars- YUM! Oyster and sea urchin covered in tasty mayo and tobiko sitting in shells that rested on top of mounds of salt, be careful not to accidentally eat some of the salt on the bottom! I think that may be why my family complained that it was \"too salty\".\n\nHotate (Bacon wrapped scallop) -2 stars- just as simple as the description says, nothing special. Can be skipped.\n\nSeafood salad -2.5 stars- was just okay, just sashimi pieces and imitation crab mixed in with seaweed salad and some type of balsamic vinaigrette. Would not order again.\n\nSushi:\nDespite this being a sushi bar, sushi is NOT what I would recommend at this restaurant. Sushi rice is bad quality and the quality of the sushi got progressively worse with every dish presented at our table. \n\nFamily Affair -3.5 stars- this was one of the better rolls of the night.\n\n49er -2.5 stars- We usually go for this roll when it's an option at sushi places because we like that sour, refreshing lemon taste that goes well with the salmon but the slices of lemons on this roll tonight was TOO RIPE and a little bitter/salty- ruined the roll for us.\n\nRomeo & Juliet -3 stars- nothing special.\n\nCherry Blossom -1 star- this was the last sushi dish that arrived, some of the pieces of salmon sashimi was starting to turn grey and it was just nauseating. We were so upset that we had to bring it up to the waitress, who listened but didn't offer anything to make up for it.\n\nDessert:\nMatcha Creme Brulee -3 stars- I had expected this to be a hot or warm desert but the creme brulee was a bit cooler than room temperature when it arrived at the table. Nothing extraordinary about this green tea-flavored creme brulee, it was okay but not something that I would highly recommend. It comes with a thin wafer cookie that had green tea cream filling, which was pretty good.\n\nMochi ice cream -4 stars- packed with flavor! We tried green tea and mango flavors.\n\nIn conclusion, YES to appetizers and NO to sushi here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-07-06"}, {"excerpts": ["The wife ordered the oyster dynamite, which was very rich and flavorful.

So far so good.... however, the negative follows. \n\nIve never had sashimi (omakase) tasted this horrible along with two fish bone left in it. The $28 twelve pieces omakase didn't look too fresh. And I thought maybe it was the lighting where we were seated. Oh man, was I wrong?!? Three of the \"pieces\" of sashimi was not a complete piece. But rather two small chunks put together and formed into \"one piece\". One pieces of the hamachi even had a small piece of skin attached to it, which was very chewy and I had to spit it out. Being a Chinese when I was taught not to be wasteful. I've forcefully finished the whole dish of \"omakase\" while the wife had only two pieces and dropped her chopsticks. \n\nThe reason I am offering two stars as review was because the staffs' service was on point, and the cooked food was actually decent. \n\nThe wife ordered the oyster dynamite, which was very rich and flavorful.

I'd say it's somewhere closer to 4.5, but I'm rounding up.\n\nI came here tonight (a Friday night) with a classmate close to 8:45pm. There was a ridiculous \"line\". By line, I mean you add your name to a list of names on a piece of paper. At first, I was a bit discouraged by the 10 small parties above our name, but it moved quite quickly. The wait really wasn't that long. While we waited, we looked at the menu and decided what to get. \n\nTo be honest, I've been to Kiki, Hotei, Kazu, and Izakaya Sozai and have not been impressed at all with any of the foods. Mediocre at best. Thus, I was pretty skeptical about Ebisu. However, all my presumptions have been destroyed.\n\nHere's what we got:\n++Sake Steamed Clams - Dashi sake butter broth - $9\nThis dish was probably the favourite of the night. The broth was delicious. If you've had belgian mussels, this is the japanese equivalent. Very delicious, and there were a handful of clams.\n\n++Live Scallops with fried something on the side - around $18ish\nThese scallops were like butter and melted in your mouth. It was really good. I wasn't quite sure what the fried stuff was. I asked but didn't hear, and didn't ask for further clarification. Scallops that melt in your mouth though, omg. Use the lemon.\n\n++Oyster Dynamite - Oysters and sea urchin baked in house dynamite sauce - $11\nThis dish was okay. It didn't stand out as anything special. It came with 4 pieces and were mounted on a mound of salt. It looks like mashed daikon, but don't be fooled.\n\n++Bincho Tataki - Seared albacore w/ onions, tobiko & ponzu - Small $16\nVery flavourful. A little bit too salty for my tastes, but all the other flavours meshed really well. This was a very good dish though. It was nicely seared on the outside, and very tender on the inside. Again, the inside was fresh enough to melt in your mouth.\n\n++Double Hamachi - Yellowtail, Scallion and Tobiko - $14.50\nI like hamachi. Lots of hamachi. This sushi was a standard size, with very fresh hamachi. For just the size, 14.50 isn't quite worth it, but you're also paying for the quality of the fish I guess. It was worth getting for sure, but I'll try a different roll next time!\n\nService was very good. Our table was too small for the amount of food we ordered. We tried to finish some dishes to be cleared away. Water was promptly refilled, tea was refilled, and we were checked on a few times to make sure everything was good. Towards the end, we were checked on quite often. I can appreciate the attentiveness.\n\nOverall:\n+Good service\n+Fresh fish\n+Delicious dishes\n-Long wait\n\nI am for sure coming back and I highly recommend this place.

"], "author": "Bryan W.", "review": "Let me first start off by saying that every sushi aficionado is entitled to his/her opinion on what the best sushi place is...\n\nThat said, I have found incontrovertible proof that, in my honest opinion, Ebisu is perhaps the best sushi experience I have had thus far. To make things short and simple, here are my 7 paths to Nirvana that I experienced.\n\n# Path 1: First Impressions\nBecause of budget constraints, I have never really taken the time to explore fancy sushi restaurants, so I am not well versed in the vibe of what a true sushi bar looks like. But stepping into Ebisu, I felt like I was in another world. Immediately after you step across the lavender curtains, you will feel like you have crossed into another part of SF that you have never seen before. On top of the aroma of tempura and the lovely interior decor (i think they recently remodeled), I felt right at home. \n\nThe menu is very lengthy and exquisite. Don't be turned off by the prices (it's not that bad), and but be turned ON by the wide selection of sashimi, rolls, appetizers, etc. After a long debate with my friend, we ordered the Okasame, Toro (albacore belly), Family Affair, and Romeo and Juliet. Now, here goes...\n\n# Path 2: Okasame. \nIn Japanese, Okasame means \"I'll leave it to you,\" which is a fine and beautiful name. The Okasame, is basically a chef's selection of sashimi for you and possibly another person to eat. My friend and I got the $25 one, which included, halibut, skipjack, escolar, tuna, salmon, hamachi (I think that's all?). It's definitely safe to say that each one had its one unique, fresh, flavor that I have never experienced before at any sushi bar/ restaurant. The hamachi and escolar in particular were very fatty and mouthwateringly delicious (melts in your mouth).\n\n# Path 3: Toro\nOMY, THIS IS THE ONE. Even though this one was a bit pricy, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE. Sometimes it's not offered or they're out, but ask! The taste, texture, and everything in between is too hard to describe, so please do yourself a favor and check it. You get two pieces, so share with a friend!\n\n# Path 4: Family Affair\nFirst of all, I usually don't get rolls (yuck, California), but the descriptions on Ebisu's menu, on top of their fancy names, caught my eye. The Family Affair -Tuna, Avocado, Albacore, Maui Onions, Negi,Tobiko and Spicy Aioli- was definitely something I have never experienced before. So many flavors in one!!!\n\n# Path 5: Romeo and Juliet\nCan it get better? YES. Romeo and Juliet-Scallop, Salmon, Avocado, Tobiko and Japanese Mayo- definitely stole the show for us. With every mouthwatering bite, you not only taste the soft, fatty, texture of the salmon, but you also experience the chewy goodness of scallop. That... plus the mayo! \n\n# Path 6: The Atmosphere\nIf you ever have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, make like Shia Labeauf and DO IT. I had my initial hesitations about sitting at the bar (less quiet), but it's safe to say we had a blast. Our chef (forgot his name :( ) was so funny, kind, and everything in between. He answered any questions that we had and made our time a memorable one! And next to us was a funny drunk couple who was served by Sazuki, apparently a sushi chef who rivals that of Jiro. We're definitely checking him out next time. \n\n# Path 7: The generosity. \nHowever, what really made our experience was the generosity and kindness of our chef. Seeing that we were curious about a lot of the items, he generously let us try some! For example, we got to sample this roll (i forgot the name omg) but best yet, he let us try Sazuki's famous kobe beef. Even though we only had a small slice, I think I was in heaven haha.\n\nOverall, this place is THE PLACE that I have been looking forward to. Maybe you have found better, but I honestly had a blast and felt really bad leaving. In the end, the total was about 69 (add another 13 or so for tip), which was a lot less than my WTP (I was thinking it'd be 100).

The sushi chefs were friendly and outgoing and extremely attentive. We tried multiple pieces of nigiri, the Kobe beef appetizer and the Hanukkah roll with smoked salmon.

Approaching closing time for most locations around the area, we jumped on Yelp. 4.5 stars, 400 reviews?

The lady over the phone said 'it's not too bad', so we rushed over there and only saw the line was almost out of the door.  But I was determined to try this place, so we waited for our table.  Luckily, we got to sit at the bar after 30 minutes or so.  It was a very busy evening, but I like to take my time and enjoy my sushi at the bar (especially if we are paying a lot for this meal!)  \nWe saw some special on the menu and asked the chef about it. Instead of explaining to us exactly what they had, he just said he will order for us. So we trusted him... but I wish we didn't...    The kobe beef sashimi ($15) was too much for us (12 pieces) since i wanted to try other fish.  So i was not too happy about that.  \n\nWe also tried some nigiri:\n\n1. hamachi toro: pretty good ($8.5)\n\n2. salmon toro: also good ($7.5)\n\n3. amaebi:  had better ones ($9.5).  And when i asked what options we had for the shrimp head, the chef said they would fry it. When i asked about cooking it in miso soup, he responded that they would do that too.. So when we requested for miso soup, he came back and told us that the kitchen already fried the head!  again, this should never happen at a Japanese restaurant! \n\n4. lobster tempura ($15):  never had lobster this way before. interesting, wish there were more sauces to make it more flavorful.\n\n5. ocean trout nigiri ($8): i've asked for it to be slightly torched.  not bad... but again, i wish the chef can recommend more and better choices. \n\n6. we ended up trying live scallop special at the end since there weren't any other fresh fish we were really interested in.  However the problem was it was an order of 8 pieces of scallop nigiri ($18). why would they do that again?  i just want to try one piece!!! but i was 'forced' to commit to eating four pieces if i wanted to try it..  and sadly enough, it was not the freshest or the best scallop i've had!  again, a bit disappointed!  \n\nafter all that, our bill was around $100.   Were they good sushi? not bad. I've had better and cheaper ones.  The sad part is although i was full, i didn't walk out satisfied.

When I moved to SF, it was from the mid-west, where... sushi is *not so good.*  Always an experience that made me a bit apprehensive.  Ebisu was the first place I was taken in SF, the place that made me love sushi, crave it, eat it several times a week.\n\nThe wait staff is nice, friendly, and attentive in a polite way -- not hovering but there when you need them.  They pace meals well, bringing one or two orders at a time, clearing plates constantly through the meal, and checking back to make sure everything is OK frequently.  Someone is almost constantly coming through with water and tea refills as well.  There can be a long wait for a table during peak hours on weekends, but it's a very popular place, so that is to be expected.  I usually go in early or on week nights and rarely have a wait.\n\nThe restaurant was remodeled a couple of years ago, and I like it a lot better now.  It looks cleaner and more modern.  That said, I miss the tatami room in the back, which was great for larger parties. It is a bit difficult to bring a group to Ebisu now.  I find it is best suited for parties of 4 or smaller, and the dining configuration is even more cramped now that they've eliminated some of the seating space in the remodel.\n\nOn to the most important matter:  the food.  I'm easily put off by \"fishy\" smells or tastes.  I've never found that to be a concern here.  Fish is always very fresh, cuts are good.  They have a wide selection of both more conventional dishes and Westernized specialty rolls.  Some of the rolls are unique to Ebisu and quite inventive compared to other sushi places in this city.  It is true that they have scaled down the menu after the remodel, but there are still enough choices to keep anyone happy.  My \"must order\" list always seems to grow, far beyond what I can actually eat in one sitting. :)\n\nMy standard order (why, yes, I'm a glutton):\n\n1) 49ER ROLL - This is a must order.  Ebisu has ruined me. Theirs is the best; if it's on the menu at any other sushi restaurant, I order it, and then am disappointed when it's not as good as Ebisu's.  If it's not on the menu elsewhere, I'm crestfallen.  It is now impossible to be satisfied with a sushi meal if there is no 49'er roll.  Last weekend, one of my friends had to endure my attempt to peel slivers of lemon to put on my non-49er-roll at another establishment.  The combination is really *that* good.\n\n2) Sashimi - usually sake or hirame in my case, but I've yet to hear of anything that's not good.\n\n3) Kobe beef sashimi or nigiri, whatever is on the day's special\n\n4) UMESHISO maki roll - I feel as strongly about this as I do the 49er roll; not coincidentally, this is also one of the standards by which I judge sushi places.  A bit unfair, unbalanced, and strange, I know, but hey, I am all of those things!\n\n5) Ebisu Maki - I'd thought they'd dropped this from the menu, but it's just been relocated under the non-specialty roll section.  It's a maki roll with salmon and a bunch of vegetables (like sprouts, cucumber, some root veggies, can't recall exactly).\n\n6) The a la carte skewers I've tried have been quite good and I usually order one or more after failing to convince myself that I've ordered quite enough already.\n\n\nThere are a lot of other wonderful things that I don't order, because I am allergic to them, and consequently, my life is very sad.  But my friends order them, rave over them, and I drool and wish I could eat them.  For example:\n- Potato Bug\n- Dragon Roll\n- Caterpillar\n- Hamachi Sashimi, in particular, I've heard is very good\n\n\nThe portions for most items are pretty generous.  Obviously sashimi and nigiri orders are not very large, but the specialty rolls are enormous.   If I am being reasonable about the amount of food that is strictly necessary, I would be content with one specialty roll, one piece of sashimi and maybe a small maki roll (like umeshiso or avocado).  I am not very reasonable though....\n\nThe only negative experience at Ebisu, is when the check comes, and I do a double take before remembering how much I ordered.\n\nI have tried just ordering take-out to avoid this problem but it doesn't really work since as soon as I look at the menu, I find myself rattling off half a dozen items.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["KOBE BEEF is a must try.\n", "2.

It's all about the smile!\n\nThere are two servers who stood out the most to me. I believe their names are Maname and Charlie.

Depending on how busy, you can always ask them to try and make something different for you and they will do it.\n\nThe owners are usually there so you can ask them any questions that you have about their menu and all that.\n\n\n\nPrice:\nThere are a lot of overpriced sushi restaurants out in the city, but I have to admit that the prices here are VERY reasonable for the quality.\n\nI've heard/read a lot of people giving really good ratings for high-end sushi restaurants that have great quality foods and beautiful presentations and HIGH prices. This spot can give you that for so much more less than what you would pay at a super fancy sushi restaurant.\n\n\n\nParking:\nBecause it's in the sunset, there's street parking.

After all three of us nearly finished the dishes, we still were not satiated so we ordered the deluxe sushi dinner which is composed of tuna, salmon, scallop, yellowtail tuna, clam, salmon roe, sea urchin, unagi, and CA rolls (see pic).

Not all chefs here are great.  But they're all pretty good if you communicate with them on what you want; and 2. the price is high...  so it's tricky to control that when you go freestyle.  On the chefs...  Why are some of them not up to the standard?  I think after making spicy tuna roll, roll after roll, a lot of your desire to be a good sushi chef can just simply evaporate.  How good does one need to be at making spicy tuna roll...  anyway?  It's got lower grade tuna with a lot of hot sauce.  Buy it at Whole Foods if you will.  So how should one order at Ebisu?  You have to let go the old fashioned approach of trusting your chef blindly, but not so much as to embrace everything you see on the menu.  \n\nI go there (or used to go there when my rent was cheaper at a few blocks away from the restaurant) for the guarantee on certain items I love so much.  Black cod.  Live scallops.  The entire Aji prepared from head to tail.  Incomparably fresh Uni (or live Uni from time to time, if you're lucky ).  And once in a while I throw in Kobe beef sashmi and some salmon belly.  Or any other interesting fish that is on the special board that day.  I have not been disappointed.\n\nTo be able to indulge ridiculously fresh fish that many other restaurants will just outrightly tell you that they don't have it because people don't eat that here...

One thing I noticed is the perfect cohesion of rice to fish on their nigiri.  Rice was perfectly seasoned: no textural issues, didn't fall apart, was good rice to fish ratio (i.e. Good balance) and the fish was excellent quality.  Falling apart from freshness, clean smelling and so texturally consistent.  The aji and Kobe roll were highlights.  Never had aji and it's resemblance to Saba is only skin deep.  Eric sliced the top of the skin in diagonal slices along the length of the fish and it was the meatiest, sweetest simplest offering that had the best bite of the night.

This will be a super long review since we went all out :)\n\nCame here on a Saturday around 6:30pm, waited about 45 minutes for a table for 4. The hostess in charge of the waitlist seemed grumpy (at least she was equally indifferent to everyone I guess....).\n\nOnce seated, the food was served very quickly after we ordered and the waitresses were really nice and friendly. \n\nAppetizers:\nKobe (Beef) Sashimi -3.5 stars- always heard about this raw beef sashimi but never actually tried it, wasn't sure if I would able to stomach raw meat but it was fine! The meat was unsalted, soft and chewy. It came with a small plate of soy sauce, which was good, and three types of spicy sauce, which I did not like so I skipped.\n\nSake Steamed Mussels -4 stars- I really liked this appetizer but it was very salty. I liked the flavors in the soup containing a leafy green (spinach?), shiitake mushrooms and dried scallops in a sake/soy sauce soup base I think. Glad we made the switch to mussels based on the waitress's recommendation, she said it has a bigger portion than the clams.\n\nGindara (Sake kasu marinated black cod) -5 stars- almost missed this gem! Very tasty, the fish practically melts in your mouth, the smooth garlicky (sake kasu) sauce was also very good. This was definitely our favorite appetizer/dish of the night. The only unfortunate part was the small portion size since it was an appetizer, we had to savor every last piece \n\nOyster Dynamite -4.5 stars- YUM! Oyster and sea urchin covered in tasty mayo and tobiko sitting in shells that rested on top of mounds of salt, be careful not to accidentally eat some of the salt on the bottom! I think that may be why my family complained that it was \"too salty\".\n\nHotate (Bacon wrapped scallop) -2 stars- just as simple as the description says, nothing special. Can be skipped.\n\nSeafood salad -2.5 stars- was just okay, just sashimi pieces and imitation crab mixed in with seaweed salad and some type of balsamic vinaigrette. Would not order again.\n\nSushi:\nDespite this being a sushi bar, sushi is NOT what I would recommend at this restaurant. Sushi rice is bad quality and the quality of the sushi got progressively worse with every dish presented at our table. \n\nFamily Affair -3.5 stars- this was one of the better rolls of the night.\n\n49er -2.5 stars- We usually go for this roll when it's an option at sushi places because we like that sour, refreshing lemon taste that goes well with the salmon but the slices of lemons on this roll tonight was TOO RIPE and a little bitter/salty- ruined the roll for us.\n\nRomeo & Juliet -3 stars- nothing special.\n\nCherry Blossom -1 star- this was the last sushi dish that arrived, some of the pieces of salmon sashimi was starting to turn grey and it was just nauseating. We were so upset that we had to bring it up to the waitress, who listened but didn't offer anything to make up for it.\n\nDessert:\nMatcha Creme Brulee -3 stars- I had expected this to be a hot or warm desert but the creme brulee was a bit cooler than room temperature when it arrived at the table. Nothing extraordinary about this green tea-flavored creme brulee, it was okay but not something that I would highly recommend. It comes with a thin wafer cookie that had green tea cream filling, which was pretty good.\n\nMochi ice cream -4 stars- packed with flavor! We tried green tea and mango flavors.\n\nIn conclusion, YES to appetizers and NO to sushi here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-07-06"}, {"excerpts": ["shiitake mushroom skewers had a lot of flavor.

The beef Sukiyaki is unbelievable - huge iron skillet filled with so many ingredients I lose count, and it's also a wonderful dish to share. The teriyaki and katsu dishes are also top notch - plentiful portions with a generous helping of salad and roasted vegetables including carrots, potatoes and broccolini, something I wouldn't have imagined at a Japanese restaurant. Feels more like an Italian presentation on the plate, but I find the veggies a wonderful contrast. If you love batter-fried anything, try the Chicken Nanban; the accompanying sauce is creamy and wonderful, similar to tartar sauce. Also love the Kobe beef kushiyaki; yes the skewers are small, but the meat is tender and sprinkled with sesame seeds.

We were craving some fishy fish fish sashimi! We got the Oysters Barnabi and the Chirashi! We all got the same thing since we didn't want any of those rolls. The oysters barnabi, holy smokes, was that thing DELICIOUS! I dreamt about it all the time! Everything just melted together once you slurped it up. The uni, especially, was so delicious. First you taste the uni, quail egg, and oyster melting together and then you get an aftertaste of ponzu sauce, sealing the deal. We kept gushing about it even after our chirashi came. As for the chirashi, wow, so much delicious fish! Extremely filling and definitely worth the price! The fish was all so fresh and delicious. Melt in your mouth kind of stuff too!\n\nThe second time I went on a date with my boyfriend. Since he's not too fond of fish, we got a roll. Well, we still ordered the oysters barnabi since I kept dreaming about it, as well as the Ebisu Combo. This time however, the oysters barnabi didn't exactly knock my socks off. The uni didn't seem that great and it didn't taste as fresh. Maybe it was just the day and time... But I was definitely a little upset it wasn't that great. As for the Ebisu combo, I would have to say the chirashi is much better. The ebisu combo has an extra roll and not as much fish as I wanted. We also ordered the Swamp roll, which was good! \n\nHowever, they charged us $13 each for the oyster barnabi when the menu clearly stated it was $9. They also overcharged the first time I came with my girlfriends, $10 instead. But it was only a dollar more so we didn't complain. But the second time, there was no way I was going to let it slide. One more star off for that.\n\nOverall, the second time was just average compared to the first time. I think it's just because of what I ordered.

"], "author": "Teri C.", "review": "It is with much sadness that I write this review.  \n\nEbisu used to be my all time favorite restaurant years ago. I have brought friends, boyfriends, lovers and everything in between to this place, sitting only at the sushi bar (tables are for squares).  I used to come here before sushi became popular, before I had my first job, before it got crazy.  (I don't know how I ever paid for this pleasure before!)  The sushi chefs and the owners would see me coming in each week with a different person.  They would greet me with a \"Hey Teri!\" and turn to greet whoever is following me in, only to realize it's someone different than the previous week.  (If anything, the staff at Ebisu must have known more about my business than anyone else!)  They would ask me about my family, mentioning they saw my sister or brother there the other day.  Yeah, our family goes there a lot.\n\nAt one point, I used to come every night, dropping almost a hundred dollars with my dining companion as we gorged on nigiri, ankimo, oysters on the half shell, and whatever we desired that evening.  I remember this one night we were across town eating sushi.  We ordered one thing, tasted it, looked at each other and said \"Ebisu?\", paid for our one order, and left.  We hauled ass back to the Sunset so we can take a seat at the bar and eat what we knew would satisfy our craving.\n\nIt's been awhile since I've returned to Ebisu, and I was bringing a friend who hadn't been there in over 7years.  She was skeptical as her first time wasn't the most memorable.  But she was willing to try again...with me.  \n\nI arrived at 7 pm and there was no wait as I sat at the sushi bar.  Drink orders were taken and hot towels came out.  Edamame was placed in front of me as I waited patiently for my guest to arrive.  I was sitting in front of a new sushi chef, new to me, and maybe new to Ebisu?  The guy next to him I've seen before, but my regular was booked up on his end.  \n\nWe ordered nigiri - maguro, amaebi, hamachi, aji, sake, unagi, and ikura.  I was disappointed with the thin slices of fish sitting on my rice.   I was used to generous slices laid out over my rice, covering it completely.  Hmmm...what happened?  My ikura eggs were so little!  Two pieces smashed together, and I initially thought it was just one piece.  When I realized it was my two order, I felt gypped!  \n\nI ordered the ankimo and our amaebi heads arrived with tempura dipping sauce.  I always ask for Ponzu sauce to dip the heads in and had to ask not once, but twice for my sauce.  Meanwhile, my heads were not hot by the time I got to them.\n\nI'm a big water and tea drinker, especially when I'm at Ebisu and I have always appreciated that my glasses have never been empty when I am there.  Usually they are pretty good with filling my glasses so I don't notice they are doing it, but that wasn't the case this time.  Maybe they cup was closer to me than usual and they had to interrupt my conversation to ask to refill it.  But I remember when they used to come around the other side and just fill it w/o any interruptions, I miss that.  \n\nI guess the next time I go, I'm going to wait until I get to sit in front of my sushi chef regulars because I think that alone will change my experience.  Ebisu brings back such fond memories.  Gosh, the screaming laughter that would evoke from my mouth when I was in great company, and that was always without alcohol involved.  How  I miss those crazy days!\n\nUpdate: 12/01/06 - Sadly, Ebisu remains three stars...barely at this point.  The service was okay.  I waited for my regular chef, but no luck! The one I had was juggling too many parties at one time, and sushi was just average.  The only highlight was the live uni - see the photo above ($17.50).  Damn good for that.  \n\nUpdate: 11/28/07 - Open seats were available in front my sushi chef and that made all the difference!  They were out of live uni though, which made me sad.  But I had the bonito sashimi with creamy sauce and I just love picking up every single tobiko egg left in that dish. It's just so good with the onions and stuff.  Yum!  Good size nigiri pieces in general, much better than my original visit for this review.  The BF was impressed with the fattiness of our amaebi here as well. \n\nService was much better this time, and more like what I was used to.  Tea and water were perfect and I didn't feel any vultures on me.  And of course, hearing \"Hi Teri!\" didn't hurt either.

At $15, there was a generous amount of meat and not too much batter. I preferred soy sauce and wasabi to their aioli, but I really liked the dish. For vegetables, the ohitashi duo was a nice light dish (spinach and pea sprouts with bonito).\n\nAs for the sashimi, it was fresh, and favorites included the escolar (butterfish), hamachi toro, and maguro. We also got a couple of rolls - the Tokyo tower was probably the prettiest one.\n\nAs for sake, they have a limited selection, but prices are reasonable. We had a large bottle of the hoyo kuro no Hana for $45.   \n\nPresentation of the dishes is beautiful. It's a pretty small place, so it's probably not the best for huge groups.  With 2 or 3 people, sitting at the sushi bar in front of the chefs is probably a better option (per my friend, who's a regular there).

The tobiko ... so crisp and flavorful. One little pop carried the full force of the sea with it. The Bonito Tataki, a true favorite of mine, was the best I've had anywhere. \n\nOn the downside, no reservations, and it is a bit of a hassle to get and stay seated. Took about 1/2 hr to get 2 seats on a Friday at 8pm, not surprising. Ended up at the bar, which I highly recommend, as our sushi chef made great off-the-menu recommendations. However, us and another couple were asked to \"scoot down\" during our meal so they could shuffle seats at the bar. Not the end of the world, but not 5 star treatment.\n\nThe menu is a bit unwieldy, with way too many items. I recommend picking a few things you know and love, and then letting the chefs take control. Everything we ordered off the specials menu was outstanding. When we requested the XXX roll, our chef went off the menu, I noticed the same things going on next to us, with the chefs interacting with the customer and coming up with a tailored creation. The Ohitashi Duo was really yummy and unique, if you want some veggies involved.\n\nThe prices are pretty standard for SF Sushi joints. We blew about $100 for 2 people with 3 beers each and a belly packing meal. They have a holiday deal going on, where you can get a $100 gift card for $90.

Randomly decided to pop into Ebisu in the Inner Sunset.\n\nI've been here once before a long time ago (back when they had that awesome pork belly app on the menu) and I had loved it.  This time was no different.  The fish has been fresh every time I've dined here.  We had a miso soup and seaweed salad to start.  Many places use frozen seaweed salad that they thaw out during the day.  Sometimes this can lead to pretty slimy stuff but Ebisu must rinse theirs out with water or something because it comes out clean and vibrant not dark and mushy.  Maybe they just have a really good supplier.  I don't know but that stuff is addicting.\n\nI guess I should mention my parents used to run a sushi joint and I worked in many a sushi restaurant in my early years.\n\nAnyway, back to the food.  We had a tempura appetizer; tako (octopus), hamachi toro (yellowtail belly), saba (mackerel) with shiso leaf (Japanese mint), and ikura with uzura (salmon roe with raw quail egg on top) nigiri.  All were fresh and cut in decent portions.  Large enough to be worth the price but small enough that it didn't choke you when you put it in your mouth.  \n\nFor the rolls we chose 3: Behind the Green Door, Hanukah, and the Louisiana Hot Link.  \"Green Door\" was on the crazier side with numerous ingredients.  Still very delicious and plated beautifully.  The Hanukah was a smoked salmon/salmon skin roll which had a bit too much rice and not enough salmon skin.  The famous Louisiana Hot Link was spicy yellowtail, burdock root and bonito.  That one was an odd but still tasty flavor.\n\nThe food is fantastic.  The space is really small so there was a wait the last 2 times I was here.  Not a big deal for some good food but the waiting area just inside the front door is TINY.  Last time I was here it was winter and waiting outside was a bummer.\n\nService is efficient and friendly but they need to work on pacing.

The lady over the phone said 'it's not too bad', so we rushed over there and only saw the line was almost out of the door.  But I was determined to try this place, so we waited for our table.  Luckily, we got to sit at the bar after 30 minutes or so.  It was a very busy evening, but I like to take my time and enjoy my sushi at the bar (especially if we are paying a lot for this meal!)  \nWe saw some special on the menu and asked the chef about it. Instead of explaining to us exactly what they had, he just said he will order for us. So we trusted him... but I wish we didn't...    The kobe beef sashimi ($15) was too much for us (12 pieces) since i wanted to try other fish.  So i was not too happy about that.  \n\nWe also tried some nigiri:\n\n1. hamachi toro: pretty good ($8.5)\n\n2. salmon toro: also good ($7.5)\n\n3. amaebi:  had better ones ($9.5).  And when i asked what options we had for the shrimp head, the chef said they would fry it. When i asked about cooking it in miso soup, he responded that they would do that too.. So when we requested for miso soup, he came back and told us that the kitchen already fried the head!  again, this should never happen at a Japanese restaurant! \n\n4. lobster tempura ($15):  never had lobster this way before. interesting, wish there were more sauces to make it more flavorful.\n\n5. ocean trout nigiri ($8): i've asked for it to be slightly torched.  not bad... but again, i wish the chef can recommend more and better choices. \n\n6. we ended up trying live scallop special at the end since there weren't any other fresh fish we were really interested in.  However the problem was it was an order of 8 pieces of scallop nigiri ($18). why would they do that again?  i just want to try one piece!!! but i was 'forced' to commit to eating four pieces if i wanted to try it..  and sadly enough, it was not the freshest or the best scallop i've had!  again, a bit disappointed!  \n\nafter all that, our bill was around $100.   Were they good sushi? not bad. I've had better and cheaper ones.  The sad part is although i was full, i didn't walk out satisfied.   Maybe I am just too spoiled by all the other really good Japanese restaurants I've been in LA and San Diego.  Come on, SF, show me some good sushi!!!

This time was no different.  The fish has been fresh every time I've dined here.  We had a miso soup and seaweed salad to start.  Many places use frozen seaweed salad that they thaw out during the day.  Sometimes this can lead to pretty slimy stuff but Ebisu must rinse theirs out with water or something because it comes out clean and vibrant not dark and mushy.  Maybe they just have a really good supplier.

All were fresh and cut in decent portions.  Large enough to be worth the price but small enough that it didn't choke you when you put it in your mouth.  \n\nFor the rolls we chose 3: Behind the Green Door, Hanukah, and the Louisiana Hot Link.  \"Green Door\" was on the crazier side with numerous ingredients.  Still very delicious and plated beautifully.  The Hanukah was a smoked salmon/salmon skin roll which had a bit too much rice and not enough salmon skin.  The famous Louisiana Hot Link was spicy yellowtail, burdock root and bonito.  That one was an odd but still tasty flavor.\n\nThe food is fantastic.

Itamae Isa-san is the epitome of a convivial, funny chef.  I arrived at 2pm, after the lunch rush, and the place was relatively empty (compared to Saturday, when it was packed!).  He and I chatted at length about cuts of fish, the history of sushi, and obscure terms like \"jabara\" and \"shimofuri.\"  If he didn't have an answer, he dragged other members of the staff into the conversation.  Did you know that shimofuri is a term,  meaning fat-marbled red meat, that is used for toro and beef carpaccio because shimo evokes images of frost, delicate and white?\n\n2. Isa-san cured me of my aversion to escolar (because of the icky watery cuts -- post-frozen --- I'd had at Daimaru).  I simply asked him about escolar -- without ordering it -- and he quickly prepared a mini sashimi dish with three little pieces of escolar on it, with minced ginger and a dab of yuzu paste.  It was terrific, cost me nothing, and will undoubtedly inspire me to order lots more of it from them!  That's good service!\n\n3. Isa's cutting and presentation are top notch.  He served my hamachi toro and otoro sashimi plate with a couple of pieces of halibut wrapped around cucumber sticks.

The only difference with me is that I will go back, no, CRAWL back,  to San Tung in a heartbeat and am willing to line up for their five spices beef noodle soup (apologies if some of you don't like it, but this was a favorite of my late father's when we used to spend Saturdays at the original hole in the wall location), spicy honey garlic chicken wings, and of course the boiled pork and cabbage dumpling goodness.\nI've always walked out happy at San Tung, even at its current location #2 that doesn't quite taste the same as the former #1.\n\nIf sitting at the sushi bar only and getting the original old #1 sushi chef serving you is the only way to enjoy a visit here, then it is not worth my time. Especially when Koo is just a stone's throw away where Kiyoshi-san's craft and ingenuity can easily give you improvisational multiple orgasms while jazz music is playing in the background.\n\nSo anyway, I'm in a foul mood today. \n\nLooky at the restaurant's website and their online menu:\n\nAppetizer: Matzoh Ball - Fresh ground fish with spices and deep fried. Oy vey, this is so wrong. What is a deep fried fish ball with a Kosher/Jewish food name doing here? If I were hard core Jewish, I'd rather be banned from the synagogue for eating nigiri laced with crab, scallops, and oysters, than eating a deep fried fish ball called Matzoh (and not in chicken soup either). OK I take that back, deep fried fishball is ok so long as it is skewered and served in a Hong Kong style curry sauce....\n\n------OOOOOO (accept no substitutes)\n\nMud Pie 7.00  (Sea urchin tempura) - this sounds so wrong. Inside the sea urchin, inbetween the yellowy golden brown lobes of gonads are some dark black yucky stuff. Perhaps if the stuff is tempura fried then the name mud pie would be apt.\n\nLunch: \nSashimi $9.50 - Fresh raw filet of tuna | soy sauce | Japanese green mustard. I thought wasabi was a horseradish kinda thing, or a root. Japanese mustard is karashi and yellow brown. \n \nSushi:\nTORA fatty white/red tuna seasonal. I like TORO (and of course the reviews of my man Toro E), but WTF is TORA?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORA\n\nor is it Ebisu's Freudian slip about the Pearl Harbor attack movie?\n\nNEGIMACHI yellow tail with green onion 4.75. How cute. Re-inventing something called Negi-Hama. Maybe it is a play on \"Nihonmachi?\"\nWhat's next? Negi-rame? Negi-guro?

"], "author": "Heidi M.", "review": "I've been eating here fairly regularly for at least 10 years and have never had a bad meal or an unpleasant experience.  When I moved to SF, it was from the mid-west, where... sushi is *not so good.*  Always an experience that made me a bit apprehensive.  Ebisu was the first place I was taken in SF, the place that made me love sushi, crave it, eat it several times a week.\n\nThe wait staff is nice, friendly, and attentive in a polite way -- not hovering but there when you need them.  They pace meals well, bringing one or two orders at a time, clearing plates constantly through the meal, and checking back to make sure everything is OK frequently.  Someone is almost constantly coming through with water and tea refills as well.  There can be a long wait for a table during peak hours on weekends, but it's a very popular place, so that is to be expected.  I usually go in early or on week nights and rarely have a wait.\n\nThe restaurant was remodeled a couple of years ago, and I like it a lot better now.  It looks cleaner and more modern.  That said, I miss the tatami room in the back, which was great for larger parties. It is a bit difficult to bring a group to Ebisu now.  I find it is best suited for parties of 4 or smaller, and the dining configuration is even more cramped now that they've eliminated some of the seating space in the remodel.\n\nOn to the most important matter:  the food.  I'm easily put off by \"fishy\" smells or tastes.  I've never found that to be a concern here.  Fish is always very fresh, cuts are good.  They have a wide selection of both more conventional dishes and Westernized specialty rolls.  Some of the rolls are unique to Ebisu and quite inventive compared to other sushi places in this city.  It is true that they have scaled down the menu after the remodel, but there are still enough choices to keep anyone happy.  My \"must order\" list always seems to grow, far beyond what I can actually eat in one sitting. :)\n\nMy standard order (why, yes, I'm a glutton):\n\n1) 49ER ROLL - This is a must order.  Ebisu has ruined me. Theirs is the best; if it's on the menu at any other sushi restaurant, I order it, and then am disappointed when it's not as good as Ebisu's.  If it's not on the menu elsewhere, I'm crestfallen.  It is now impossible to be satisfied with a sushi meal if there is no 49'er roll.  Last weekend, one of my friends had to endure my attempt to peel slivers of lemon to put on my non-49er-roll at another establishment.  The combination is really *that* good.\n\n2) Sashimi - usually sake or hirame in my case, but I've yet to hear of anything that's not good.\n\n3) Kobe beef sashimi or nigiri, whatever is on the day's special\n\n4) UMESHISO maki roll - I feel as strongly about this as I do the 49er roll; not coincidentally, this is also one of the standards by which I judge sushi places.  A bit unfair, unbalanced, and strange, I know, but hey, I am all of those things!\n\n5) Ebisu Maki - I'd thought they'd dropped this from the menu, but it's just been relocated under the non-specialty roll section.  It's a maki roll with salmon and a bunch of vegetables (like sprouts, cucumber, some root veggies, can't recall exactly).\n\n6) The a la carte skewers I've tried have been quite good and I usually order one or more after failing to convince myself that I've ordered quite enough already.\n\n\nThere are a lot of other wonderful things that I don't order, because I am allergic to them, and consequently, my life is very sad.  But my friends order them, rave over them, and I drool and wish I could eat them.  For example:\n- Potato Bug\n- Dragon Roll\n- Caterpillar\n- Hamachi Sashimi, in particular, I've heard is very good\n\n\nThe portions for most items are pretty generous.  Obviously sashimi and nigiri orders are not very large, but the specialty rolls are enormous.   If I am being reasonable about the amount of food that is strictly necessary, I would be content with one specialty roll, one piece of sashimi and maybe a small maki roll (like umeshiso or avocado).  I am not very reasonable though....\n\nThe only negative experience at Ebisu, is when the check comes, and I do a double take before remembering how much I ordered.\n\nI have tried just ordering take-out to avoid this problem but it doesn't really work since as soon as I look at the menu, I find myself rattling off half a dozen items.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["EBISU MAKI salmon with vegetables 5.50 - OXYMORON, ", "when they explain in ABOUT US, that Ebisu himself in the restaurant logo,  holds a fishing rod and a sea bream (tai).

At first I was worried that they would make it cold and uninviting, but the decor successfully blends together old-world Japanese architecture with a modern flare.  Now every time I bring someone to Ebisu, I am excited to show them the subtle details and styling cues that make the decor a winning work of interior design.  I do however miss the Japanese sitting room.\n\nThe staff is extremely courteous and knowledgeable.  The waitress that always serves me reads the specials menu as-if she wrote it herself.  Although I know the menu by heart, her suggestions for new things to try are always guaranteed to please.\n\nIn addition to remodeling the interior, they also took this opportunity to revamp the menu and give the presentation some flare.  I always knew that their chefs were culinary artists, but now their work looks as beautiful as it tastes.  There are new appetizers that could easily quality as a meal themselves (for instance, the sashimi treo), but blend seamlessly with the rest of the menu.  Luckily, my favorite items are still gracing the menu -- double hamachi and QP roll.\n\nTo pair with your meal, be sure to do yourself a favor by ordering a \"Melon Breeze.\"  This sake-based melon and cucumber drink is bound to make you grin with joy.

Shorty, Goose, Kid, Sushi Snob, etc.  And even though this is my first review I must start it on the write note.  \n\nFor the last 11 years I have been going back and forth with my love/hate relationship with Ebisu.  It was a real treat to eat there...   Expensive, long waits and sometimes meaningless service.  But the Fish was excellent and pieces nicely cut (depending on who your chef was), the creativity was endless. \n\nFor the first 5 years of my SF Sushi experience I had 2 favorite haunts.  Hamano and Ebisu.  Hamano changed owners a few years back and went to shit...   I fell back in love with Ebisu and quickly became friends with the entire Fuji family who have owned and opperated Ebisu for over 20 years.  \n\nDont be fooled!  The new menu with all the fancy pictures is for the tourists.  At one point in time the menu was a 1 page laminated piece of paper with limited items.  Much different was the colorful unique items hitting the Bar and tables that wern't listed on the menu.  Such as: The Sunrise, Dinosaur feet, QP roll, seafood salad, and the 49er roll (Salmon/AVO/Lemon, an Ebisu original so I was told, not a huge fan).  What made Ebisu special was you were forced to interact with other patrons and the chefs to discover these hidden gems for yourself.  It's a bit different these days...  Limited discovery but still an adventure no matter how you order!\n\nTo be honest...  I never use a menu at Ebisu... I use my eyes and my nose...  Then I let the Sushi Chef do his thing...  My favs are Jackson, Tommy and of course the master, Suzuki San.  A local legend who speaks 32 languages!  Amazing!  \n\nI am always up for a new adventure.  Come join me anytime.  No waiting and the experience will blow your mind.  \n\nOkay now my review:\n\nFish is some of the freshest in the world.  Sake Selection is decent.  Beers are all bottled and they have all the imported and domestic Japanese originals.  Make friends quickly by offering a sake bomb contest for free beer!  Live Uni when available will amaze.  Live Scallop is top notch.  Ankimo is house made.   O-Toro, Chu-Toro, BLUE FIN!!! The Aji rocks!  Steve says he invented the Miso Butterfish that Roy Yamaguchi made so popular.  It is great here!  The Unagi is crispy and the Tamago will take you to heaven.  The Sushi chefs have lots of tricks hidding up their sleeves let them mystify and levitate your sushi experience!

Randomly decided to pop into Ebisu in the Inner Sunset.\n\nI've been here once before a long time ago (back when they had that awesome pork belly app on the menu) and I had loved it.  This time was no different.  The fish has been fresh every time I've dined here.  We had a miso soup and seaweed salad to start.  Many places use frozen seaweed salad that they thaw out during the day.  Sometimes this can lead to pretty slimy stuff but Ebisu must rinse theirs out with water or something because it comes out clean and vibrant not dark and mushy.  Maybe they just have a really good supplier.  I don't know but that stuff is addicting.\n\nI guess I should mention my parents used to run a sushi joint and I worked in many a sushi restaurant in my early years.\n\nAnyway, back to the food.  We had a tempura appetizer; tako (octopus), hamachi toro (yellowtail belly), saba (mackerel) with shiso leaf (Japanese mint), and ikura with uzura (salmon roe with raw quail egg on top) nigiri.  All were fresh and cut in decent portions.  Large enough to be worth the price but small enough that it didn't choke you when you put it in your mouth.  \n\nFor the rolls we chose 3: Behind the Green Door, Hanukah, and the Louisiana Hot Link.  \"Green Door\" was on the crazier side with numerous ingredients.  Still very delicious and plated beautifully.  The Hanukah was a smoked salmon/salmon skin roll which had a bit too much rice and not enough salmon skin.  The famous Louisiana Hot Link was spicy yellowtail, burdock root and bonito.  That one was an odd but still tasty flavor.\n\nThe food is fantastic.  The space is really small so there was a wait the last 2 times I was here.  Not a big deal for some good food but the waiting area just inside the front door is TINY.  Last time I was here it was winter and waiting outside was a bummer.\n\nService is efficient and friendly but they need to work on pacing.  Our waitress was very attentive but kept trying to clear plates too soon.  She even stood by the table next to ours, asked the guest if they wanted the last piece of edamame on the plate, and proceeded to wait around while they ate it.

They have quite an extensive menu, so I'd advise against looking through every single option because you'd just be wasting your time. Ebisu has a lot of choices for sashimi, nigiri, and specialty rolls, along with appetizers, udon, and bento box meals. The restaurant is small and tables are very close together. There's bar seating as well, where you get to order directly from the sushi chef instead of a waiter/waitress.\n\nIf you like variety in a meal, I recommend the lunch or dinner combo bento boxes, at $15 or $20, respectively. They're excellent deals and contain enough food for up to two people! The meal includes miso soup, rice, green salad, seaweed salad, cooked spinach salad, and three entrees. The entree options include shrimp and vegetable tempura, teriyaki salmon, chicken, or beef, fried oyster, sashimi, or maki sushi. There's quite a selection here.\n\nI've tried the Omakase dinner set, which is the chef's selection of sashimi. It's priced at $25 (serves one to two people) or at $50 (serves three or four people). In reality, if you love sashimi, get the $25 set all for yourself because it's enough for one person. The sashimi selection varies, but most of the time, maguro and sake are included.\n\nI haven't been very pleased with some of the specialty sushi options here. I tried the Boston Roll (salmon, cucumber, avocado, crab and tobiko) and the 49er Roll (salmon, avocado, tobiko, shiso, and lemon). The Boston Roll had imitation crab, which was a huge disappointment. And the 49er roll had too much rice so that the fish to rice ratio was off.\n\nEbisu offers expensive, but still considered affordable, sushi. Quality is fresh. Service friendly.

Since my boyfriend lives in San Francisco and I work in the city, the trip to Alameda all the time was getting too much so we decided to venture out of our comfort zone and find a place a city that can live up to our standards. After several trial and error, we decided to give Ebisu a try since it was only a few blocks away from his house.\n\nEbisu is not some where you would want to go for a quiet dinner. The quaint little restaurant is always crowded and loud which was evidence that the food was good since so many people are there to eat! The decor of the restaurant is cute and you have the option of sitting at a table or at the sushi bar. Personally, I love sitting at the sushi bar since I generally only order sushi anyways.  The first two times we tried Ebisu, we sat at a table which can get a little annoying because the tables are very close to each other so if you're not a people person and claustrophobic, then take out might be your best bet. After those two times, we decided to sit at the bar. Sitting at the sushi bar does have it's perks! When you are seated, a waitress brings you a hot towel to clean your hands. The sushi chefs greet you immediately and serve you complimentary edamame (which is not given to you if you sit at a table). The selection of sushi is amazing! They have a wide variety of fresh fish and they even serve live Uni and live scallops! Personally, my boyfriend and I are fans of specialty rolls. Although they do not have a wide variety of specialty rolls, the ones they do carry are delicious and reasonably priced! Their Boston roll is only $6.95!! The sushi chefs are extremely nice and helpful. Ricky, who overheard my boyfriend say how he wished they had a roll with his favorite ingredients, immediately made a roll to his liking! He hasn't stopped talking about it since! Now every time we go back, we ask the chefs to make a customized roll for us depending on what we are craving. The waitresses are also extremely helpful and nice. My drinks never see the bottom of the cup because they refill it before it is even half empty! Great customer service!\n\nOne of the best things about Ebisu on top of their excellent customer service and delicious food is their rewards program. They offer a \"frequent eaters\" card that gives you 1 point for every dollar you spend (not including tax). When you hit 100 pts, you get 10% off. At 1000 pts, you get a gift card for $100! Once we heard about it, we signed up immediately and have been using it since! Great way to be rewarded for being a regular!\n\nI recommend Ebisu for sushi lovers who are in the sunset area and even if you're not, it's worth traveling to for a great meal!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-01-30"}], "catepillar": [{"excerpts": ["We had 4 rolls - Catepillar, Swamp, Romeo and Juliet, and Louisiana Hot Link.

This is quite possibly my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco. I almost didn't go to Ebisu as my friend asked, but then my Hinge date bailed on me so I didn't feel guilty about trying a new Asian place near where my friend lives. \n\nFirst off, location: good location in the Inner Sunset, near UCSF Parnassus and some Metro Muni lines. I haven't spent much time in that neighborhood but really liked the vibes I got from walking around before and after dinner. \n\nSecondly: lines. My friend and I got there just before 6 on a Friday night and were seated immediately. Shortly after, a large line appeared and people were waiting both inside and outside! Luckily there's lots of cute shops to explore in if you have to wait. \n\nThirdly, the food: the best part. There were so many cold and hot appetizers to choose from, so many entrees, so many sushi dishes, and specialty rolls, my friend and I spent a good 15-20 minutes figuring out what to order. We decided to split everything: the 49er roll, kakuni, 1-2 person Omakase, and matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nThe 49er roll had salmon, avocado, tobiko, shiso, and lemon. We were hesitant to try it due to the lemon but it worked! It was a thin slice and brought a unique tang to the roll that I wouldn't recommend for everyone, but I enjoyed it. We did not try the Dexter Carter but had considered it. \n\nThe kakuni appetizer was TO DIE FOR. The fatty pork belly tasted caramelized, and, like the 49er roll with lemon, fruity due to a satsuma sauce. 10/10 would recommend the kakuni. \n\nThe omakase for 1-2 people was plenty for us! It came with tuna, salmon, butterfish, yellowtail, amberjack, and halibut. The butterfish and amberjack were surprisingly perfect (they were the pale-colored ones I think), but they were all good and fresh and hearty slices. I believe each one came with 3 slices each. It was filling and well-worth $28! \n\nEven though my friend and I were stuffed, we went ahead and tried the matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The wait and trip out to the Inner Sunset would be worth it just for this unique dish. There was a thick layer of mousse beneath the crispy burnt top layer. The bottom layers were colder than that layer on top. It came with a thin shortbread-like cookie with matcha filling that was alright--the main focus was on flipping matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! A must-order. \n\nLastly, service: some other reviews here said service wasn't very good or professional, which was the opposite of my experience. Everyone working there was calm, knowledgeable (I asked which sashimi was what at least three times), warm, and kept filling up my water cup! They politely and discreetly tried to get us to leave to flip the table by giving us the check early and asking if we wanted dessert when we still had some sashimi left on our plates, which is to be expected. \n\nBathrooms could be cleaner but they are gender-neutral. \n\nTLDR: amazing restaurant with great service. Order the kakuni and matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, as well as a specialty sushi roll.

One of my go to places to eat is Ebisu. I love it for its location, price, atmosphere, freshness, and taste. Here's my rundown.\n\nLocation: Conveniently located at one of the stops along the N (9th and Judah), just a few stores down. Parking is pretty standard for San Francisco. You might be able to find a space along 9th or on adjacent streets. Save the environment though and take the Muni as there's also a lot that you can do in the area after your meal (drinks and dessert).\n\nPrice: Pretty reasonably priced. Not the cheapest in terms of sushi but the substance is there. I've had more expensive sushi in The City but there was no discernable increase in value at these places.\n\nAtmosphere: Very welcoming and intimate. Especially compared to the cold outside in Inner Suset, the service is warm and friendly. Just get past the wait, possibly by having something to drink, and get ready to enjoy the experience. For extra fun, sit in front of the itamae (sushi chef). They're quite a \"punny\" bunch.\n\nFreshness: Almost all of the seafood tastes like it came fresh that morning from the sea. It doesn't have the texture that might come from refreezing and thawing fish. If you want an extra special treat, take a look at their specials and, better yet, order the life uni when they have it. I ordered it once and it was still moving on the table when it was served to us. To this day, it's still some of the best sea urchin I've ever had.\n\nTaste: Unlike a lot of other sushi places I've tried in SF, Ebisu's flavor comes off as well-balanced. There is no heavy reliance on mayo or sauces. Instead, a careful balance of more natural flavors helps inform the dishes. For a great example of this, check out the Dexter Carter roll.\n\nTL;DR: Great taste, value, and atmosphere.

I'd say it's somewhere closer to 4.5, but I'm rounding up.\n\nI came here tonight (a Friday night) with a classmate close to 8:45pm. There was a ridiculous \"line\". By line, I mean you add your name to a list of names on a piece of paper. At first, I was a bit discouraged by the 10 small parties above our name, but it moved quite quickly. The wait really wasn't that long. While we waited, we looked at the menu and decided what to get. \n\nTo be honest, I've been to Kiki, Hotei, Kazu, and Izakaya Sozai and have not been impressed at all with any of the foods. Mediocre at best. Thus, I was pretty skeptical about Ebisu. However, all my presumptions have been destroyed.\n\nHere's what we got:\n++Sake Steamed Clams - Dashi sake butter broth - $9\nThis dish was probably the favourite of the night. The broth was delicious. If you've had belgian mussels, this is the japanese equivalent. Very delicious, and there were a handful of clams.\n\n++Live Scallops with fried something on the side - around $18ish\nThese scallops were like butter and melted in your mouth. It was really good. I wasn't quite sure what the fried stuff was. I asked but didn't hear, and didn't ask for further clarification. Scallops that melt in your mouth though, omg. Use the lemon.\n\n++Oyster Dynamite - Oysters and sea urchin baked in house dynamite sauce - $11\nThis dish was okay. It didn't stand out as anything special. It came with 4 pieces and were mounted on a mound of salt. It looks like mashed daikon, but don't be fooled.\n\n++Bincho Tataki - Seared albacore w/ onions, tobiko & ponzu - Small $16\nVery flavourful. A little bit too salty for my tastes, but all the other flavours meshed really well. This was a very good dish though. It was nicely seared on the outside, and very tender on the inside. Again, the inside was fresh enough to melt in your mouth.\n\n++Double Hamachi - Yellowtail, Scallion and Tobiko - $14.50\nI like hamachi. Lots of hamachi. This sushi was a standard size, with very fresh hamachi. For just the size, 14.50 isn't quite worth it, but you're also paying for the quality of the fish I guess. It was worth getting for sure, but I'll try a different roll next time!\n\nService was very good. Our table was too small for the amount of food we ordered. We tried to finish some dishes to be cleared away. Water was promptly refilled, tea was refilled, and we were checked on a few times to make sure everything was good. Towards the end, we were checked on quite often. I can appreciate the attentiveness.\n\nOverall:\n+Good service\n+Fresh fish\n+Delicious dishes\n-Long wait\n\nI am for sure coming back and I highly recommend this place. It's a bit on the pricer side, but it's worth it.

As a matter of fact, I haven't eaten anything that can be comparable in awhile. The food was authentic, and didn't have any of those imitation crabs or weird sauces on it.

Would make a great catching up place. Or a date =]\n\nThe live uni special was disappointing. It was pretty much an uni shell on the bottom, white radish, then around 6-7 slices of uni. I was expecting more - that sea urchin was BIG. But no, it has as much as around 3 uni nigiris. It tasted like... uni. I was expecting it to taste somewhat difference since it was literally \"freshly killed.\" But oh well. I'm a fan of uni, but I think the amount they gave wasn't worth the cost ($20)\n\nThe two rolls were great. The fishes were all fresh and firm. Dipping it with a hint of soy sauce w/ wasabi and ginger was exceptional. The rice had a unique hint of flavor in it too. I just wish it wasn't so small.\n\nThe nigiri was pretty much \"eh\" I've never had sea trout before... it looked pretty much as a sake sashimi (salmon). It also tasted similar to it. But then again, I didn't get to have a \"thorough\" taste, since the piece wasn't as large as I thought it would be, and I only had one try of it. But I don't think it was worth the money.

The hostess in charge of the waitlist seemed grumpy (at least she was equally indifferent to everyone I guess....).\n\nOnce seated, the food was served very quickly after we ordered and the waitresses were really nice and friendly. \n\nAppetizers:\nKobe (Beef) Sashimi -3.5 stars- always heard about this raw beef sashimi but never actually tried it, wasn't sure if I would able to stomach raw meat but it was fine! The meat was unsalted, soft and chewy. It came with a small plate of soy sauce, which was good, and three types of spicy sauce, which I did not like so I skipped.\n\nSake Steamed Mussels -4 stars- I really liked this appetizer but it was very salty. I liked the flavors in the soup containing a leafy green (spinach?), shiitake mushrooms and dried scallops in a sake/soy sauce soup base I think. Glad we made the switch to mussels based on the waitress's recommendation, she said it has a bigger portion than the clams.\n\nGindara (Sake kasu marinated black cod) -5 stars- almost missed this gem! Very tasty, the fish practically melts in your mouth, the smooth garlicky (sake kasu) sauce was also very good. This was definitely our favorite appetizer/dish of the night. The only unfortunate part was the small portion size since it was an appetizer, we had to savor every last piece \n\nOyster Dynamite -4.5 stars- YUM! Oyster and sea urchin covered in tasty mayo and tobiko sitting in shells that rested on top of mounds of salt, be careful not to accidentally eat some of the salt on the bottom! I think that may be why my family complained that it was \"too salty\".\n\nHotate (Bacon wrapped scallop) -2 stars- just as simple as the description says, nothing special. Can be skipped.\n\nSeafood salad -2.5 stars- was just okay, just sashimi pieces and imitation crab mixed in with seaweed salad and some type of balsamic vinaigrette. Would not order again.\n\nSushi:\nDespite this being a sushi bar, sushi is NOT what I would recommend at this restaurant. Sushi rice is bad quality and the quality of the sushi got progressively worse with every dish presented at our table. \n\nFamily Affair -3.5 stars- this was one of the better rolls of the night.\n\n49er -2.5 stars- We usually go for this roll when it's an option at sushi places because we like that sour, refreshing lemon taste that goes well with the salmon but the slices of lemons on this roll tonight was TOO RIPE and a little bitter/salty- ruined the roll for us.\n\nRomeo & Juliet -3 stars- nothing special.\n\nCherry Blossom -1 star- this was the last sushi dish that arrived, some of the pieces of salmon sashimi was starting to turn grey and it was just nauseating. We were so upset that we had to bring it up to the waitress, who listened but didn't offer anything to make up for it.\n\nDessert:\nMatcha Creme Brulee -3 stars- I had expected this to be a hot or warm desert but the creme brulee was a bit cooler than room temperature when it arrived at the table. Nothing extraordinary about this green tea-flavored creme brulee, it was okay but not something that I would highly recommend. It comes with a thin wafer cookie that had green tea cream filling, which was pretty good.\n\nMochi ice cream -4 stars- packed with flavor! We tried green tea and mango flavors.\n\nIn conclusion, YES to appetizers and NO to sushi here.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-07-06"}, {"excerpts": ["I also ordered the rock n roll and family affair and I would highly recommend giving family affair a try.

"], "author": "Bryan W.", "review": "Let me first start off by saying that every sushi aficionado is entitled to his/her opinion on what the best sushi place is...\n\nThat said, I have found incontrovertible proof that, in my honest opinion, Ebisu is perhaps the best sushi experience I have had thus far. To make things short and simple, here are my 7 paths to Nirvana that I experienced.\n\n# Path 1: First Impressions\nBecause of budget constraints, I have never really taken the time to explore fancy sushi restaurants, so I am not well versed in the vibe of what a true sushi bar looks like. But stepping into Ebisu, I felt like I was in another world. Immediately after you step across the lavender curtains, you will feel like you have crossed into another part of SF that you have never seen before. On top of the aroma of tempura and the lovely interior decor (i think they recently remodeled), I felt right at home. \n\nThe menu is very lengthy and exquisite. Don't be turned off by the prices (it's not that bad), and but be turned ON by the wide selection of sashimi, rolls, appetizers, etc. After a long debate with my friend, we ordered the Okasame, Toro (albacore belly), Family Affair, and Romeo and Juliet. Now, here goes...\n\n# Path 2: Okasame. \nIn Japanese, Okasame means \"I'll leave it to you,\" which is a fine and beautiful name. The Okasame, is basically a chef's selection of sashimi for you and possibly another person to eat. My friend and I got the $25 one, which included, halibut, skipjack, escolar, tuna, salmon, hamachi (I think that's all?). It's definitely safe to say that each one had its one unique, fresh, flavor that I have never experienced before at any sushi bar/ restaurant. The hamachi and escolar in particular were very fatty and mouthwateringly delicious (melts in your mouth).\n\n# Path 3: Toro\nOMY, THIS IS THE ONE. Even though this one was a bit pricy, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE. Sometimes it's not offered or they're out, but ask! The taste, texture, and everything in between is too hard to describe, so please do yourself a favor and check it. You get two pieces, so share with a friend!\n\n# Path 4: Family Affair\nFirst of all, I usually don't get rolls (yuck, California), but the descriptions on Ebisu's menu, on top of their fancy names, caught my eye. The Family Affair -Tuna, Avocado, Albacore, Maui Onions, Negi,Tobiko and Spicy Aioli- was definitely something I have never experienced before. So many flavors in one!!!\n\n# Path 5: Romeo and Juliet\nCan it get better? YES. Romeo and Juliet-Scallop, Salmon, Avocado, Tobiko and Japanese Mayo- definitely stole the show for us. With every mouthwatering bite, you not only taste the soft, fatty, texture of the salmon, but you also experience the chewy goodness of scallop. That... plus the mayo! \n\n# Path 6: The Atmosphere\nIf you ever have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, make like Shia Labeauf and DO IT. I had my initial hesitations about sitting at the bar (less quiet), but it's safe to say we had a blast. Our chef (forgot his name :( ) was so funny, kind, and everything in between. He answered any questions that we had and made our time a memorable one! And next to us was a funny drunk couple who was served by Sazuki, apparently a sushi chef who rivals that of Jiro. We're definitely checking him out next time. \n\n# Path 7: The generosity. \nHowever, what really made our experience was the generosity and kindness of our chef. Seeing that we were curious about a lot of the items, he generously let us try some! For example, we got to sample this roll (i forgot the name omg) but best yet, he let us try Sazuki's famous kobe beef. Even though we only had a small slice, I think I was in heaven haha.\n\nOverall, this place is THE PLACE that I have been looking forward to. Maybe you have found better, but I honestly had a blast and felt really bad leaving. In the end, the total was about 69 (add another 13 or so for tip), which was a lot less than my WTP (I was thinking it'd be 100).

When I moved to SF, it was from the mid-west, where... sushi is *not so good.*  Always an experience that made me a bit apprehensive.  Ebisu was the first place I was taken in SF, the place that made me love sushi, crave it, eat it several times a week.\n\nThe wait staff is nice, friendly, and attentive in a polite way -- not hovering but there when you need them.  They pace meals well, bringing one or two orders at a time, clearing plates constantly through the meal, and checking back to make sure everything is OK frequently.  Someone is almost constantly coming through with water and tea refills as well.  There can be a long wait for a table during peak hours on weekends, but it's a very popular place, so that is to be expected.  I usually go in early or on week nights and rarely have a wait.\n\nThe restaurant was remodeled a couple of years ago, and I like it a lot better now.  It looks cleaner and more modern.  That said, I miss the tatami room in the back, which was great for larger parties. It is a bit difficult to bring a group to Ebisu now.  I find it is best suited for parties of 4 or smaller, and the dining configuration is even more cramped now that they've eliminated some of the seating space in the remodel.\n\nOn to the most important matter:  the food.  I'm easily put off by \"fishy\" smells or tastes.  I've never found that to be a concern here.  Fish is always very fresh, cuts are good.  They have a wide selection of both more conventional dishes and Westernized specialty rolls.  Some of the rolls are unique to Ebisu and quite inventive compared to other sushi places in this city.  It is true that they have scaled down the menu after the remodel, but there are still enough choices to keep anyone happy.  My \"must order\" list always seems to grow, far beyond what I can actually eat in one sitting. :)\n\nMy standard order (why, yes, I'm a glutton):\n\n1) 49ER ROLL - This is a must order.  Ebisu has ruined me. Theirs is the best; if it's on the menu at any other sushi restaurant, I order it, and then am disappointed when it's not as good as Ebisu's.  If it's not on the menu elsewhere, I'm crestfallen.  It is now impossible to be satisfied with a sushi meal if there is no 49'er roll.  Last weekend, one of my friends had to endure my attempt to peel slivers of lemon to put on my non-49er-roll at another establishment.  The combination is really *that* good.\n\n2) Sashimi - usually sake or hirame in my case, but I've yet to hear of anything that's not good.\n\n3) Kobe beef sashimi or nigiri, whatever is on the day's special\n\n4) UMESHISO maki roll - I feel as strongly about this as I do the 49er roll; not coincidentally, this is also one of the standards by which I judge sushi places.  A bit unfair, unbalanced, and strange, I know, but hey, I am all of those things!\n\n5) Ebisu Maki - I'd thought they'd dropped this from the menu, but it's just been relocated under the non-specialty roll section.  It's a maki roll with salmon and a bunch of vegetables (like sprouts, cucumber, some root veggies, can't recall exactly).\n\n6) The a la carte skewers I've tried have been quite good and I usually order one or more after failing to convince myself that I've ordered quite enough already.\n\n\nThere are a lot of other wonderful things that I don't order, because I am allergic to them, and consequently, my life is very sad.  But my friends order them, rave over them, and I drool and wish I could eat them.  For example:\n- Potato Bug\n- Dragon Roll\n- Caterpillar\n- Hamachi Sashimi, in particular, I've heard is very good\n\n\nThe portions for most items are pretty generous.  Obviously sashimi and nigiri orders are not very large, but the specialty rolls are enormous.   If I am being reasonable about the amount of food that is strictly necessary, I would be content with one specialty roll, one piece of sashimi and maybe a small maki roll (like umeshiso or avocado).  I am not very reasonable though....\n\nThe only negative experience at Ebisu, is when the check comes, and I do a double take before remembering how much I ordered.\n\nI have tried just ordering take-out to avoid this problem but it doesn't really work since as soon as I look at the menu, I find myself rattling off half a dozen items.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["(mix of wakame salad, and different cubes of salmon, tuna, albacore, clam, hamachi, and dakion coated in a sweet miso sauce)\n\nPotato Bug.\n\n"], "author": "Lauren Y.", "review": "Recently renovated for their beautiful interior! \n\nAMAZING SUSHI. recommendations:\n\nraw oysters.\n\nDouble Hamachi Roll.  \n\nSwamp Roll.\n\nSEAFOOD SALAD!

The waitress said we can put the baby on the booth, but we politely declined and then she said if the ppl next to us need to get out the baby will be in the way but they were fine with it and we said we'd move him if they need to get out, no biggie. The waitress then proceeded to grab the baby car seat and move the baby herself. Excuse me, but you don't EVER touch anyone else's baby. If you were to drop him on accident, you'd be dead meat. My friend and I got up and said we'll just move him then, but she insisted on moving him herself, squeezing her butt in between our table and the table next to us that's not wide enough for a person to fit through and then using only one arm that looked like she didn't have a good grip at all on the car seat and placed the baby on the booth that was, in fact, too narrow but she pushed the table in so that it would be \"more stable\". If that was my baby, I would have had some strong words with management, but I kept quiet because it's not my issue, but I do see this as a big issue. I used to work in big chain restaurants and she simply should have said \"Keeping the baby under the table is a fire hazard.

It was def not worth $14. \n\nI just wasn't feeling it. It wasn't terrible though, don't get me wrong. But it was average, which is why I'd give it a 3 star but the unprofessional waitress experience made me wanna drop it down another star but i didnt this time.

"], "author": "Bryan W.", "review": "Let me first start off by saying that every sushi aficionado is entitled to his/her opinion on what the best sushi place is...\n\nThat said, I have found incontrovertible proof that, in my honest opinion, Ebisu is perhaps the best sushi experience I have had thus far. To make things short and simple, here are my 7 paths to Nirvana that I experienced.\n\n# Path 1: First Impressions\nBecause of budget constraints, I have never really taken the time to explore fancy sushi restaurants, so I am not well versed in the vibe of what a true sushi bar looks like. But stepping into Ebisu, I felt like I was in another world. Immediately after you step across the lavender curtains, you will feel like you have crossed into another part of SF that you have never seen before. On top of the aroma of tempura and the lovely interior decor (i think they recently remodeled), I felt right at home. \n\nThe menu is very lengthy and exquisite. Don't be turned off by the prices (it's not that bad), and but be turned ON by the wide selection of sashimi, rolls, appetizers, etc. After a long debate with my friend, we ordered the Okasame, Toro (albacore belly), Family Affair, and Romeo and Juliet. Now, here goes...\n\n# Path 2: Okasame. \nIn Japanese, Okasame means \"I'll leave it to you,\" which is a fine and beautiful name. The Okasame, is basically a chef's selection of sashimi for you and possibly another person to eat. My friend and I got the $25 one, which included, halibut, skipjack, escolar, tuna, salmon, hamachi (I think that's all?). It's definitely safe to say that each one had its one unique, fresh, flavor that I have never experienced before at any sushi bar/ restaurant. The hamachi and escolar in particular were very fatty and mouthwateringly delicious (melts in your mouth).\n\n# Path 3: Toro\nOMY, THIS IS THE ONE. Even though this one was a bit pricy, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE. Sometimes it's not offered or they're out, but ask! The taste, texture, and everything in between is too hard to describe, so please do yourself a favor and check it. You get two pieces, so share with a friend!\n\n# Path 4: Family Affair\nFirst of all, I usually don't get rolls (yuck, California), but the descriptions on Ebisu's menu, on top of their fancy names, caught my eye. The Family Affair -Tuna, Avocado, Albacore, Maui Onions, Negi,Tobiko and Spicy Aioli- was definitely something I have never experienced before. So many flavors in one!!!\n\n# Path 5: Romeo and Juliet\nCan it get better? YES. Romeo and Juliet-Scallop, Salmon, Avocado, Tobiko and Japanese Mayo- definitely stole the show for us. With every mouthwatering bite, you not only taste the soft, fatty, texture of the salmon, but you also experience the chewy goodness of scallop. That... plus the mayo! \n\n# Path 6: The Atmosphere\nIf you ever have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, make like Shia Labeauf and DO IT. I had my initial hesitations about sitting at the bar (less quiet), but it's safe to say we had a blast. Our chef (forgot his name :( ) was so funny, kind, and everything in between. He answered any questions that we had and made our time a memorable one! And next to us was a funny drunk couple who was served by Sazuki, apparently a sushi chef who rivals that of Jiro. We're definitely checking him out next time. \n\n# Path 7: The generosity. \nHowever, what really made our experience was the generosity and kindness of our chef. Seeing that we were curious about a lot of the items, he generously let us try some! For example, we got to sample this roll (i forgot the name omg) but best yet, he let us try Sazuki's famous kobe beef. Even though we only had a small slice, I think I was in heaven haha.\n\nOverall, this place is THE PLACE that I have been looking forward to. Maybe you have found better, but I honestly had a blast and felt really bad leaving. In the end, the total was about 69 (add another 13 or so for tip), which was a lot less than my WTP (I was thinking it'd be 100).

I was planning on meeting friends out in The Haight for the awesome drink special at Trax tonight, and I decided to meet up with my boyfriend when he got off of work and try out this new sushi spot.  I had read some really great reviews on Yelp, and a couple that worried me, but that comes with 300+ reviews.  \n\nBut what really hooked me was their website.  I visited it and their menu really impressed me.  The had a few roll combinations that sounded delicious, and I was intrigued by the idea of three different flavored edamame.  \n\nSome of the reviews had me concerned with how long our wait might be, since we were going on a Saturday @ 7.  But my boyfriend got there just moments before me and put our name in for 2, he said I wasnt there yet and that he was going to smoke a cigarette and the hostess said she would set up a table for him.  By the time I walked there and he took his last puff, our table was ready and we were seated right away.  I wouldn't say we had the best seats, allll the way in the back of the restaurant where the runners run in and out and semi-squished between the sushi bars patrons and a wall.  But none the less the lighting as good and it wasn't very loud, no need to shout, and out locations actually allowed us to get great service, so maybe it was a blessing in disguise.  Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and attentive.  She was continuously filling our water glasses and made sure to not overload our cups with just ice, very considerate.\n\nMy boyfriend has a not-so-secret obsession with crab cakes.  So when our waitress was spouting off the specials for the night I couldn't help but laugh at his facial expression as she told us about the 2 crab cakes the had for the appetizer specials.  It was 2 very large, very flavorful crab cakes for $7.50.  Not something I would normally get, but since it was date night with the hubs I decided ti splurg and do something nice for him.  And it was definitely a good choice.  They were so hot and moist and literally melted in your mouth.  They were a little rich, but I normally think that of crab dishes.  But they were both perfectly cooked and were a great treat.  We also ordered their trio of edamame.  One with normal sea salt, one with lemon garlic spice, and one with chili lime.  THEY WERE AMAZING!!!  Not only were they delicious but they gave me so many ideas of ways to flavor edamame in my own home.  I then ordered a Tokyo Tower roll (shrimp tempura), a Swamp Roll (spicy albacore with seaweed salad on top), and the Tootsie Roll with Halibut (deep fried halibut with green onions wrapped in yellow soy paper) and the boyfriend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinner.  \n\nI can honestly tell you that their Swamp Roll was hands down one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had in all of my sushi dining experiences.  Beautiful spicy albacore (we're talking a very generous portion of albacore) and perfectly seasoned seaweed salad on top.  I was very impressed and eager to try the other rolls I had ordered.  OUt next was our Tootsie Roll.  This was just ehhh, almost borderline bleeehhhh to be completely honest.  It was the smallest portion of fried halibut in the inside this roll.  And very thin sice of uncooked green onion.  I wasn't a fan of this, and was rather disappointed in fact since halibut is my favorite fish.  And then my boyfriend Chicken Teriyaki dinner came out.  There was a surprisingly large amount of chicken in his dinner.  With little potato chip thingys on the top. It was more Hawaiian BBQ than Chicken Teriyaki.  And the portion was rice served with it has half of what it should be.  And for $15 this dinner really should have come with more than a smll side of rice and miso soup.  Maybe a salad?

The had a few roll combinations that sounded delicious, and I was intrigued by the idea of three different flavored edamame.  \n\nSome of the reviews had me concerned with how long our wait might be, since we were going on a Saturday @ 7.  But my boyfriend got there just moments before me and put our name in for 2, he said I wasnt there yet and that he was going to smoke a cigarette and the hostess said she would set up a table for him.  By the time I walked there and he took his last puff, our table was ready and we were seated right away.  I wouldn't say we had the best seats, allll the way in the back of the restaurant where the runners run in and out and semi-squished between the sushi bars patrons and a wall.  But none the less the lighting as good and it wasn't very loud, no need to shout, and out locations actually allowed us to get great service, so maybe it was a blessing in disguise.  Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and attentive.  She was continuously filling our water glasses and made sure to not overload our cups with just ice, very considerate.\n\nMy boyfriend has a not-so-secret obsession with crab cakes.  So when our waitress was spouting off the specials for the night I couldn't help but laugh at his facial expression as she told us about the 2 crab cakes the had for the appetizer specials.  It was 2 very large, very flavorful crab cakes for $7.50.  Not something I would normally get, but since it was date night with the hubs I decided ti splurg and do something nice for him.  And it was definitely a good choice.  They were so hot and moist and literally melted in your mouth.  They were a little rich, but I normally think that of crab dishes.  But they were both perfectly cooked and were a great treat.  We also ordered their trio of edamame.  One with normal sea salt, one with lemon garlic spice, and one with chili lime.  THEY WERE AMAZING!!!  Not only were they delicious but they gave me so many ideas of ways to flavor edamame in my own home.  I then ordered a Tokyo Tower roll (shrimp tempura), a Swamp Roll (spicy albacore with seaweed salad on top), and the Tootsie Roll with Halibut (deep fried halibut with green onions wrapped in yellow soy paper) and the boyfriend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinner.  \n\nI can honestly tell you that their Swamp Roll was hands down one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had in all of my sushi dining experiences.  Beautiful spicy albacore (we're talking a very generous portion of albacore) and perfectly seasoned seaweed salad on top.  I was very impressed and eager to try the other rolls I had ordered.  OUt next was our Tootsie Roll.  This was just ehhh, almost borderline bleeehhhh to be completely honest.  It was the smallest portion of fried halibut in the inside this roll.  And very thin sice of uncooked green onion.  I wasn't a fan of this, and was rather disappointed in fact since halibut is my favorite fish.  And then my boyfriend Chicken Teriyaki dinner came out.  There was a surprisingly large amount of chicken in his dinner.  With little potato chip thingys on the top. It was more Hawaiian BBQ than Chicken Teriyaki.  And the portion was rice served with it has half of what it should be.  And for $15 this dinner really should have come with more than a smll side of rice and miso soup.  Maybe a salad?  Or some veg tempura?  That would really make it worth it.  And sadly, there was no Tokyo Tower.  When we ordered our waitress couldn't find her little notebook pad so she didn't write anything down.  And, just my luck, she forgot my 3rd roll.  She said she would bring one out, but by the this time we had already finished all the food and were beginning to be full.  So we just asked for the check and went on our way.\n\nThere were some great flavors I tasted here.  Our service was great and the prices were relatively reasonable.
