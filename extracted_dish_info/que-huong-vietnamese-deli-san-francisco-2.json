Goi Ga (chicken salad with cabbage) is bland and needs a lot of nuoc mam.\n\nThe place is a hole in the wall but there are limited seating inside, maybe for half a dozen eaters.

Thanks Yelp as I would have been bummed without jalapenos. I got the chicken banh mi, add pate. The chicken was good, but there was very little pate. It didn't really add the creaminess to the sandwich that I wanted. I also got the spring roll which was okay. Since it was room temp, the wrapper was a little hard which made the texture a little chewier than I wanted. The strawberry shake hit the spot but was a touch too sweet for me. The roommate got the rest of the dishes. He enjoyed the beef stew. I loved the bread as it had a great crustiness.\n\nSince we ordered through Eat24, there was $5 delivery charge and a $0.10 SF bag fee.
