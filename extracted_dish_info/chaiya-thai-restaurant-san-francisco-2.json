Shocked, but also intrigued.  Because as much as I might worry why no one has tried this place, there's always that possibility it's an undiscovered gem!  Although, in this case...\n\nSomewhat hidden from the rest of West Portal (it's on Claremont, around the corner from the station), Chaiya is a quaint spot that's easy to overlook.  The restaurant itself is decently nice and clean, with a wealth of tables for groups large or small.  Like the decor, the menu is pretty modern as well, though compared to some of the city's newer spots, it's more basic than extensive/unique.\n\n-- CORN FRITTER - Battered Fried Corn with Thai Herbs, Spices, Chopped Kaffir Lime Leaves, and a Sweet Chili Sauce...$6\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chaiya-thai-restaurant-san-francisco-2#mHu4pCXLx308b2MD3okQGQ)\nNot bad, but the texture/consistency was a little off.

The noodles had the right bite and the chili paste added just enough heat to balance the sauce's sweetness.  The overall taste didn't amaze, but it was pretty solid.\n\n-- LAVA CHICKEN - Marinated Grilled Deep Fried Thighs Topped with Bell Pepper, Onions, Cilantro, and Signature Plum Sauce...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chaiya-thai-restaurant-san-francisco-2#-yhabMownv7E_UoxOH-yGg)\nThose four big pieces got us excited, but this was a huge miss.  The sauce was spicy (albeit sweet), but the chicken was TORCHED.  Impressive, since I've never had dark meat so overcooked and dry before.  I thought it was a typo, but maybe it really was cooked twice (\"grilled deep fried\").\n\nSince coming here, I had been debating whether to round up or down from TWO AND A HALF STARS, but I ultimately decided to round up.  As bad as the chicken was, it was just one dish.  Plus, given their location and wealth of parking, they're very convenient for dining in or doing take out (they also deliver).

These are more like fried squid-looking pieces, but the sauce it comes with is AMAZING. Some type of aoili-tartar hybrid of deliciousness. Mmhmmmmmm.\n\nAfter sending the waitress back 10 times because we weren't ready, the boys and I finally decided on:\n\nTom Yum Soup w/ Tofu: Deeeeeliciously flavored broth, BUT they seemed to have just threw a bunch of leftover veggies in there right before serving it to us because the carrots, WHITE mushrooms(wtf?) and whatever else crap in there was not soft or cooked or tender or like anything I wanted in my mouth.. (heh) but the broth itself was freakn good.\n\nVolcano Duck: WARNING: THIS SHIT AIN'T CURRY-- my illiterate friend thought we were getting curry, but this dish is tender duck meat w/ a blast of spice. More bones and other ass veggies than duck meat, but that's what you get when you order duck. Let's be real. We all know and expect that.\n\nSpecial Seafood House Noodles: Flat thick chow fun-like noodles w/ big pieces of fresh seafood- clams, shrimp, scallops, + squid. Whatever their house sauce is= YUM! I'd recommend this shiet.\n\nMango Trout: This is a whole fried trout with a side of mango salsa. Each of us tasted the trout on its own and unanimously thought out loud that it was kind of dry. Then we realized we were supposed to eat it WITH the mango salsa and BOOM (*mindblown*)! The mangos were SO sweet and ripe-- it complemented the trout SO well. Frickn good. Yes.\n\nService was good. Our food didn't take too long, the waitress was attentive and refilled our waters in a timely manner. No complaints hurrrrrr!\n\nThe place is nice, clean, modern, and well-decorated. There was a fun fact on the wall (that they maybe change once in a while..?) about Thailand having the longest capital name... then there was a paragraph of gibberish following that I couldn't understand until the end that told me all that = Bangkok.

Although, in this case...\n\nSomewhat hidden from the rest of West Portal (it's on Claremont, around the corner from the station), Chaiya is a quaint spot that's easy to overlook.  The restaurant itself is decently nice and clean, with a wealth of tables for groups large or small.

The noodles had the right bite and the chili paste added just enough heat to balance the sauce's sweetness.  The overall taste didn't amaze, but it was pretty solid.\n\n-- LAVA CHICKEN - Marinated Grilled Deep Fried Thighs Topped with Bell Pepper, Onions, Cilantro, and Signature Plum Sauce...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chaiya-thai-restaurant-san-francisco-2#-yhabMownv7E_UoxOH-yGg)\nThose four big pieces got us excited, but this was a huge miss.
