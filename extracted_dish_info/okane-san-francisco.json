Soooooo flavorful and delicate texture. This includes shrimp and bok choy plus a hard item at the bottom. It is served along with a wooden spoon and my chawanmushi was very warm. That was nice.

Also, I loved the dipping soy sauce small dish that accompanied as well. It was so pretty! *hearts*\n\n~ Toriteba Karaage.\nThese chicken wings are irresistibly tasty! The memories were an explosion of epic proportions for my taste buds. So good! Is it from the shiso salt? I savored every bite before remembering the spicy mayo. \n\n~ Smoked tofu & tomato.\nThis was my special surprise adorned with tiny flower petal. I was told that this item is from Michelin One Star Omakase. I felt so special. Thank you!!! First time ever having tiny orange flower petals to dine upon, and the tomato was very soft and light with tofu invisible to the eye. I appreciate the time and skillfulness.\n\n~ Wakadori chicken karage.\nNice crunch and big pieces of chicken. \n\n~ Roppongi.\nNo comment. This is a specialty roll which consists of magruro, hamachi, snow crab, salmon, and avocado that is wrapped with cucumber. Nice presentation.\n\n~ Sake Black Cod & Sake Salmon. Salad in the center.\nNicely grilled and delicious.\n\nI didn't have time for dessert so maybe next time I hope to enjoy Mr. Japanese American Chef's homemade mochi and sesame ice cream!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-23"}, {"excerpts": ["- Vegetables Ippin: Cucumber and Daikon Salad, that ShioKombu dressing was so refreshing, my BFF ordered 2!

And by \"legit\", I mean the type that won't give you the Hershey squirts from all dat orange bukkake sauce. \n\nHow can I satiate my Japanese food craving while being mindful of my food expenditures? Go for lunch...specifically, weekday lunch. Lunch items tend to be less expensive and booze is out of the question when you have to return to work afterwards. Though I've been called a \"church girl\" at work (wtf?!) so maybe a couple of sake bombs will show them who I really am! *Muaahaaahaaa*\n\nMy co-worker and I went to Okane (same owner as Omakase next door) for lunch yesterday. Luckily, we came early and beat the lunch rush. They've only been opened for a couple of days and they were pretty packed by the time we left at 12:30 pm.  \n\nOkane is an izakaya restaurant (Japanese tapas). The menu is quite extensive - they have everything from agedashi tofu, chawanmushi, karaage, yakitori, tataki, sukiyaki, donburi, udon to sushi. Their lunch menu and dinner menu is pretty similar except that they don't offer the bento boxes at dinner. They also offer omakase at the sushi bar ($80?). Beer, sake, and wine only.\n\nWe started out with the Jidori Egg Chawanmushi ($8): http://bit.ly/1Pntwfs. The jidori egg gave the custard a brighter yellow hue than usual. Loved the silky and lush texture but it needed a touch of salt or soy for flavor. Although the shrimp tempura was perfectly crunchy and airy, I prefer the traditional steamed shrimp. The bok choy was an odd garnish and made one of the tempura pieces soggy.\n\nI ordered the Shokudo Bento Box w/ chicken karaage as my protein ($14): http://bit.ly/1OCsJUz. It was accompanied with a beautiful medley of other items: shiozake, marinated kelp, fishcake, tamago, japanese pickles, rice, and miso soup.\n\nThe miso soup was too salty for me so I just picked out the tofu and seaweed to eat but my co-worker enjoyed it. My barometer of a good Japanese restaurant is their rice. The short-grain rice was sticky and had a good chew (not mushy). For functionality purposes, I would have preferred the rice in a bowl. I'm a messy eater to begin with so it was hard to eat rice off a wooden board with chopsticks without flinging some into my hair. Told you, I'm messy af.\n\nThe chicken karaage was nicely crisp and tender but it was a little dry and I didn't taste much garlic and ginger flavor. Slurp Ramen in Chinatown has my favorite karaage to date. The other items refreshingly and subtly rounded out the meal. Save the tamago (sweet Japanese omelet) as a \"dessert\". Portions are appropriately Japanese sized. If you have a big appetite, you'll probably still be hungry after the bento box.\n\nService was cordial and prompt since we were the first customers. It slowed down as they got busier though. \n\nThe dining area is minimalistic and zen with wooden furnishings and a wall of Japanese noh masks. There's only one large high top for 8 people, so it's recommended to come in a party of 2-4 people. \n\nEasy street parking. \n\nSince we went to Okane for lunch and were being mindful of the bill, I didn't get to sample as much of the menu as I wanted to. What we had, however, was pretty solid and was approved by my Japanese co-worker. \n\nAn izakaya meal is not a true \"izakaya\" meal without sake and beer flowing so for round two, let's let our hair down and get a little ratchet - sake bomb time?", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-01-22"}], "beef skewers": [{"excerpts": ["The tempura bad, the beef skewers had no taste, the agedashi tofu was actually tofu tempura, yuck.

"], "author": "Johnny W.", "review": "*** In Short ***\n\nDecent izakaya with okay to tasty dishes, but pricing relative to portions lends to poor value.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nI took advantage of that fact that I was In the area for a nearby art exhibition last weekend to come and try Okane while they were still new, and hopefully, not too crowded. Coming in around 8pm without a reservation, my date and I were lucky enough to get seated almost immediately, at the last open table at the time.\n\nNow, I've never been to Omakase, and I'm admittedly not a huge fan of sashimi. However, Okane has branded itself as an izakaya, and I ordered accordingly, for the most part::\n\n* Sake Lees Alaskan Black Cod - I use black cod as a baseline to judge izakayas by, and while theirs wasn't bad, it was lighter in flavor than I would have expected, and not nearly as melt-in-your-mouth tender as I would have liked.\n\n* Toriteba Karaage - A little bland on its own, but very flavorful when paired with the accompanying spicy mayo and shiso salt. But, I mean, these were just chicken wings. Sorry: expensive, chicken wings. For the same price, I could have gone to Hot Sauce and Panko and gotten almost 3x as many wings, that would have been both more flavorful and juicier.\n\n* Chawanmushi - A very, very delicately flavored chawanmushi, compared to the ones I've had in the past. Not to the point of being bland, but given the two things we'd eaten right before, it definitely was on the light side, comparatively.\n\n* Shinjuku Roll - By far the best thing we had that night, and the only thing I'd consider coming back here for. It's basically a California roll (with real crab) with a hefty portion of torched wagyu beef on top. The flavor of the California roll portion was a little more dominant than the beef, but you could definitely taste both. Pricey, at $25 for seven pieces, but more reasonable when considering the components than the other items were.\n\nSo, the problem with Okane isn't that the food is bad, because it's not.

(Don't even get me started on overfishing and sustainability...lol) Anyways, I digress. The toro was ever so slightly torched and visually you could just tell it was a fatty piece of fish by the flesh. I salivated in anticipation. When the toro first hits your tastebuds, you get that immediately recognizable \"tuna\" flavor but after that is when all comparisons end and the flavor you get is just fatty, creamy goodness. It literally melts in your mouth and if you were blindfolded, you could easily be duped into thinking this was a piece of high grade Kobe or A5 Wagyu beef. You heard of Parmesan Reggiano hailed as the undisputed king of cheeses??? Then Toro has to be the G.O.A.T of sushi....lol. \n\nWe were quite pleased in the quality of all our nigiri, especially in the fish to ride ratio. Whereas most sushi bars might try to skimp on the fish ad cut a sliver of fish that's almost transparent and place it on a mountain of rice, Okane did the exact opposite and cut a generous portion of fish that pretty much blanketed the bed of rice it was placed upon. Our only complaint on the fish was the kinmedai, which we found awfully chewy and almost gristly, not good eats. Our server also neglected to give us individual plates even though we were sharing basically everything. Minus 1 star. In short, Okane is a solid sushi bar worthy of it's big brother's Michelin status. Until you get to try out Omakase, I would suggest Okane as an affordable alternative.

A 46-seat place with beautiful and comfortable wooden tables and chairs, even the bowls and plates are carefully paired with the food. Okane opened by the Omakase team, a SoMa Design District neighborhood Izakaya and Japanese share dishes. \n\n  Chef Jackson Yu, with 18 years of experience from all over the world, and recently earned his first Michelin Star at Omakase. With new chef Shin Aoki (former Kaigetsu) created a menu with dishes that warm your heart and make your belly happy. \n\n  I truly enjoy coming here, because the GM Justin Goo (former Bar Manager at Alexander's Steakhouse and Gary Danko). Under his management, Omakase and Okane will only get better. Plus I adore one of my favorite servers Quade (former Alexander's Steakhouse SF), he is there at dinner.He's a cutie and a fire cracker, we always enjoy his service. And at lunch, Barry and Molly are both awesome servers. \n\n   Their omakase starts at $80 for 10 pieces of nigiri, a sashimi course and housemade sesame ice cream which is a bargain. They serve you at the 4-seat sushi bar.  Drinks include Japanese beer, sake and a small wine list, but very reasonable priced. I love the sparkling Brut from France, only $25 per bottle, and we enjoyed the small 300ml Sake bottle too.\n\n- Vegetables Ippin: Cucumber and Daikon Salad, that ShioKombu dressing was so refreshing, my BFF ordered 2!  Aghedashi Tofu, Yo-Dofu Tofu, Grilled Shitake Mushroom, Lotus Root Chips, Bok Choy with Sesame Mousse, were all good.\n\n- Fish Ippin: Grilled Salmon, Hamachi & Jalapeno Pepper and Alaskan Cod, were delicious. I love the Hamachi and the Cod. \n\n- Meat Ippin: Wakadori Karaage fried young chicken, Beef Skewer, and assorted chicken skewer were all good. The fried young chicken is a MUST TRY here. \n\n- Rice and Noodles: Salmon and Ikura Chazuke, rice bowl served in savory tea broth was nice. Nori and tea soup, and Udon with soft egg were all on point.\n\n- Rolls: Shinjuku Snow Crab, with A5 Wagyu Beef roll is a MUST ORDER.  I don't like roll but I will eat this roll anytime!\n\n- Sushi and Sashimi: Fresh live Uni, order it when they have it, a MUST! Otoro, Kuroamago, Tai, Kinmedai, Hirame, Aji, and Ankimo Monk Fish Liver, of course. Everything was as fresh and tasty as it gets.\n\n  I've been here a few times now, and I love it here. Lunch menu is smaller but the Bento Box is a good way to try variety of dishes. For dinner, I ran into two OG Yelpers already, Euge L and Wanugee. It's definitely a good place to hang out with friends.

Also, the udon had great bite to it, and the soft boiled egg was blanched to perfection. I'm not a huge fan of rolls either, but I'd say it was pretty good quality. \n\nDefinitely a come backer.

I went to Omakase during its first month of opening and loved it, but I immediately realized it wasn't a place to frequent other than for special occasions.\n\nTherefore, I was more than excited for Okane to open. I dined here back in February and was very impressed with their Agedashi Tofu - it was super gooey, melt-in-your-mouth, with a light ponzu sauce. Other favorites included Hokkaido Uni ($15/per pair) and the Shinjuku Roll ($25) - topped with A5 Wagyu for 7 pieces.\n\nTonight, we dined here again since we were in the neighborhood and were reminiscing their amazing tofu. We ordered it again and while it was good, it wasn't as gooey and mind-blowing as the last time. We made a note to the staff and they were so kind and immediately took it off our tab, asking what made it better last time. I can certainly appreciate when the staff takes the time to take your comments and thoughts into consideration.\n\nWe again had the Shinkuku roll and it was as good as last time, if not better. We also opted for some misc nigiri such as the Domestic Uni ($10/pair), Ikura, Sake, and Kanpachi. The domestic Uni from Maine was no comparison to the Hokkaido. Very medicore and less flavorful and creamy than Hokkaido's. The udon was pretty standard- I would've liked a few slices of meat, even if the entree cost a few dollars more. Just udon with soup and an egg is pretty bland.\n\nService is solid - the staff all share duties and frequently come to check on you and refill your drinks, never really going unattended.\n\nOverall I like Okane for a casual night out or for craving any sort of Japanese dish- they really have a pretty good variety of foods on their menu, from noodles and rice dishes to nigiri/sushi and cooked dishes.\n\nThe ambiance is inviting but spacious and pretty casual.

I went to Omakase during its first month of opening and loved it, but I immediately realized it wasn't a place to frequent other than for special occasions.\n\nTherefore, I was more than excited for Okane to open. I dined here back in February and was very impressed with their Agedashi Tofu - it was super gooey, melt-in-your-mouth, with a light ponzu sauce. Other favorites included Hokkaido Uni ($15/per pair) and the Shinjuku Roll ($25) - topped with A5 Wagyu for 7 pieces.\n\nTonight, we dined here again since we were in the neighborhood and were reminiscing their amazing tofu. We ordered it again and while it was good, it wasn't as gooey and mind-blowing as the last time. We made a note to the staff and they were so kind and immediately took it off our tab, asking what made it better last time. I can certainly appreciate when the staff takes the time to take your comments and thoughts into consideration.\n\nWe again had the Shinkuku roll and it was as good as last time, if not better. We also opted for some misc nigiri such as the Domestic Uni ($10/pair), Ikura, Sake, and Kanpachi. The domestic Uni from Maine was no comparison to the Hokkaido. Very medicore and less flavorful and creamy than Hokkaido's. The udon was pretty standard- I would've liked a few slices of meat, even if the entree cost a few dollars more. Just udon with soup and an egg is pretty bland.\n\nService is solid - the staff all share duties and frequently come to check on you and refill your drinks, never really going unattended.\n\nOverall I like Okane for a casual night out or for craving any sort of Japanese dish- they really have a pretty good variety of foods on their menu, from noodles and rice dishes to nigiri/sushi and cooked dishes.\n\nThe ambiance is inviting but spacious and pretty casual.

For me that was enough of a hook to get me strolling through their doors....lol. Well that and the fact I have been super craving quality sushi  lately. I came to Okane with the mentality of finding really high quality fish with a reasonable price point, and in that regard I believe they met my expectations. I came with a friend and we shared a bunch of nigiri. Among them were the toro, sake, hamachi belly, hokkaido uni, kinmedai, and shima aji. We also split an order of the shinjuku roll which was basically similar to a fancied up California roll but used snow crab instead and was topped with lightly torched A5 Wagyu beef. \n\nI was really excited to try the toro since this was my first time ordering it coupled by its high price point and rarity. (Don't even get me started on overfishing and sustainability...lol) Anyways, I digress. The toro was ever so slightly torched and visually you could just tell it was a fatty piece of fish by the flesh. I salivated in anticipation. When the toro first hits your tastebuds, you get that immediately recognizable \"tuna\" flavor but after that is when all comparisons end and the flavor you get is just fatty, creamy goodness. It literally melts in your mouth and if you were blindfolded, you could easily be duped into thinking this was a piece of high grade Kobe or A5 Wagyu beef. You heard of Parmesan Reggiano hailed as the undisputed king of cheeses??? Then Toro has to be the G.O.A.T of sushi....lol. \n\nWe were quite pleased in the quality of all our nigiri, especially in the fish to ride ratio. Whereas most sushi bars might try to skimp on the fish ad cut a sliver of fish that's almost transparent and place it on a mountain of rice, Okane did the exact opposite and cut a generous portion of fish that pretty much blanketed the bed of rice it was placed upon. Our only complaint on the fish was the kinmedai, which we found awfully chewy and almost gristly, not good eats. Our server also neglected to give us individual plates even though we were sharing basically everything. Minus 1 star. In short, Okane is a solid sushi bar worthy of it's big brother's Michelin status. Until you get to try out Omakase, I would suggest Okane as an affordable alternative.

Coming in around 8pm without a reservation, my date and I were lucky enough to get seated almost immediately, at the last open table at the time.\n\nNow, I've never been to Omakase, and I'm admittedly not a huge fan of sashimi. However, Okane has branded itself as an izakaya, and I ordered accordingly, for the most part::\n\n* Sake Lees Alaskan Black Cod - I use black cod as a baseline to judge izakayas by, and while theirs wasn't bad, it was lighter in flavor than I would have expected, and not nearly as melt-in-your-mouth tender as I would have liked.\n\n* Toriteba Karaage - A little bland on its own, but very flavorful when paired with the accompanying spicy mayo and shiso salt. But, I mean, these were just chicken wings. Sorry: expensive, chicken wings. For the same price, I could have gone to Hot Sauce and Panko and gotten almost 3x as many wings, that would have been both more flavorful and juicier.\n\n* Chawanmushi - A very, very delicately flavored chawanmushi, compared to the ones I've had in the past. Not to the point of being bland, but given the two things we'd eaten right before, it definitely was on the light side, comparatively.\n\n* Shinjuku Roll - By far the best thing we had that night, and the only thing I'd consider coming back here for. It's basically a California roll (with real crab) with a hefty portion of torched wagyu beef on top. The flavor of the California roll portion was a little more dominant than the beef, but you could definitely taste both. Pricey, at $25 for seven pieces, but more reasonable when considering the components than the other items were.\n\nSo, the problem with Okane isn't that the food is bad, because it's not. The problem is that, for the price (we ended up spending $40 per person after tax and tip) and the small portions, I'm expecting the food to be fantastic, if not stellar, and that, these were not. The value just isn't there. If you want a solid izakaya experience, you're better off going to Kiraku in Berkeley for something casual, or Izakaya Yuzuki in the Mission for something fancier.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - It's a brand new restaurant, so accessibility isn't a problem, with plenty of space and accessible tables.\n\nBathroom - Single, private bathrooms, and quite accessible.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-02-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Shinjuku Snow Crab, with A5 Wagyu Beef roll is a MUST ORDER.

And at lunch, Barry and Molly are both awesome servers. \n\n   Their omakase starts at $80 for 10 pieces of nigiri, a sashimi course and housemade sesame ice cream which is a bargain. They serve you at the 4-seat sushi bar.  Drinks include Japanese beer, sake and a small wine list, but very reasonable priced.

The fried young chicken is a MUST TRY here. \n\n- Rice and Noodles: Salmon and Ikura Chazuke, rice bowl served in savory tea broth was nice. Nori and tea soup, and Udon with soft egg were all on point.\n\n- Rolls: Shinjuku Snow Crab, with A5 Wagyu Beef roll is a MUST ORDER.

The first course was a beautifully presented sashimi platter of Hakkaku along with the body of the fish. It came with about 15 pieces which was a pretty good amount for the two of us.
