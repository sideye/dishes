There are only two booths that hold 6 people max if you squish, so waiting for those are a huge pain (what our group had to go through...). Huge pain = 2 hours w/o breaking a sweat.\n\nFirst Impressions: 3/5. I really did not like the name... but had high hopes because quite a few friends had been here and claimed they loved it (even the hipstery ones). The location was also pretty awkwardly hidden, but that's something that I knew i had to deal with regarding all places in SF. I did like how intimate the setting was though. It even felt casual & secluded when inside despite being so popular w/ its the roughly 800 reviews already written on Yelp.\n\nDecor/Ambiance: 4/5. My first impression was a 3/5 because everything did look very average, but I could honestly see myself going to this place quite often at every chance I got, so based on my preferences of the ideal sushi bar, I added another star. It's cramped, but things seem all the more fun that way in the city I've found. The interior isn't sparkling new or anything, but I really appreciated the down-to-earth, humble feel. It's probably not what I'd recommend for a first-date kinda place (especially w/ the long wait on most times), but it's almost a great hole-in-the-wall discovery if SF weren't so hipstery to know about it already, haha.\n\nService: 4/5. Just from my first visit, I could tell everyone working there was old-staff. The way they communicated, greeted old customers... everything was very fluid and everyone was well-trained, so there weren't any mess-ups at all. There was only one waitress too, and she was able to spot that I was a newcomer and immediately guide me to their little whiteboard of sign-ins. Throughout our wait, she would also check on us from time to time and apologized for the wait even though they really didn't have to. I always appreciate service a lot more when the staff is still able to respect customers despite the unwavering stream of success. It's good karma if anything else! During dinner, the waitress was also experienced enough to tell us that we probably had not ordered enough food for the group, and she was right on the money. Had she just written our orders down and let the events fall as they would, we would've either left hungry or be forced to wait a while for just one more serving. I appreciated that she didn't force it on us, but casually brought up the idea to let us decide for ourselves. The staff at Sushi Zone definitely made me want to come visit again, support their business, and become a regular.\n\nFood: 4/5.\nBaked Bass Appetizer (Mango, Spicy Mayo, & Fish Eggs, $6.50): 4.5/5. This was definitely unlike anything I'd ever had at a sushi restaurant, and I've been to so many. The texture was so smooth and it was served in such a unique way... no wonder it cost so much!\nRolls. The only slight disappointment was that the rice didn't taste as fresh as it could've been, but for a busy restaurant, I understand this is all about timing sometimes. The presentation for most rolls was also a bit muted, but I know they're not looking to seriously WOW people with art and whatnot... that's not what they're going for and definitely not their first priority.\nSpicy Tuna: 3/5. This was probably the 2nd most average thing ordered but a necessity for a few friends to order anyway.\nSpicy Himachi: 3/5. Nothing too special... the 3rd most average?\nSpicy Mango Salmon: 2/5. This was the most average thing we ordered, but we just chose it under pressure when the waitress hinted we didn't order enough. I wouldn't recommend this.\nHawaiian Roll #1 (Tuna, Avacado, Scallion, Mayo Sauce w/ Macadamia Nuts): 4.5/5. I loved this one! What a breath of fresh air it was to even be able to choose something seriously different and unexpected. Ok, maybe it's because I haven't been to Hawaii, but this was delicious. I'm definitely going to try the HR#2 next time I visit.\nPapaya Unagi: 4/5. Also very unique and definitely worth a try too. It's amazing how complimentary papaya can be to bbq eel, flavor and texture-wise. It took me a while to wrap my head around this one in a good way!\nSpider Roll: 3/5. This was a bit dry (rice & soft shell crab), and I was left with the unfortunate task of eating one of the end-roll pieces where the crab head and legs were sticking out. I have arachnophobia so this was a big feat (it seriously looked like a spider was crawling out of both ends...), but I took one for the team because I think everyone else in my party had arachnophobia, haha.\n\nOverall: 4/5. While many of the rolls are just rated 3/5, I'd still give them another chance, and this says a lot because we waited for about 2 hours!

The aptly named Sushi Zone fills it admirably.\n\n\n While one would to best to avoid rolls (maki) and go for the good stuff at high-end sushi restaurants, and avoid nigiri and stick to California rolls and Dynamite rolls and Caterpillar rolls on the low-end, Sushi Zone has a unique niche by specializing in rolls comprised of fresh, less commonplace combos.\n\n\n Papaya unagi.

Arriving around nine in the evening, she's surprised to see it's so packed for a Tuesday night.  Sure, it's been a year since her last visit and we get on the long list of waiting hopefuls.  With only two tables for four and about 10 counter seats, our wait extends out for about an hour.\n\nDiners are in no rush as they linger over sake and Sapporo.  With only one sushi chef, one waitress, and another assistant who manages the fryer and washes the dishes, the pace of food coming out is far from a hurried state.  We get seated a little after ten despite the CLOSED sign being put out a quarter to that hour.\n\nThe waitress takes our drink orders, which is simple with water and tea.  We also throw in some edamame since we're starving and we know the sushi is going to take awhile.  Their menu is brief, one laminated page and their specials board. \n\nThe first item to arrive is the Spicy Tuna Roll (Tuna, avocado & scallion w/ a mayonnaise base $5.50) and I am reminded of why I first started enjoying the spicy tuna roll...the mayonnaise based spicy sauce.  (I hate it when they use that Sriracha sauce. Blah!)  It comes in six pieces and the roll isn't wrapped very tightly, so you definitely have to make it in one bite.\n\nNumber two is the Spider Roll (Softshell crab, avocado, and shiso $9.00), also cut into six pieces.  The crab is still very hot as it just emerged from the fryer.  The shiso adds a nice finish to this crunchy bite.\n\nWe look over at our neighbors and are tempted by their nigiri choices.  We also order one amaebi nigiri ($4.50) and its sweet plumpness is pleasant to our tastebuds.  The deep fried shrimp heads come out shortly.    \n\nLorna D. has an obsession with mango, and anytime she sees a roll with this sweet fruit, she had to get it.  The Mango Hamachi Roll (yellowtail, mango & scallion $5.50) comes out next.  \n\nThe Alaskan Roll (salmon, avocado, & scallion $5.00) is quite satisfying with its chunky salmon bits and I find myself smiling with glee on all this lovely sushi.\n\nIt's way past 11 and I tell Lorna this is our last chance for any additional rolls she may want.  (There's another party behind us that has yet to be served!)  We go for the Spicy Scallop Roll ($5.50) and learn they are out, so we opt for the Spicy Albacore Roll ($5.50) instead.  The spiciness proves a bit too much for Lorna D., but I really couldn't ask for more.\n\nService is what you can expect when there's such few staff.  The waitress will fill your water and tea glass when you ask, just don't expect her to come around and do it automatically.  She's too busy taking orders, bringing sushi platters back and forth, and clearing the dishes.  Patience is definitely a virtue here.\n\nSushi is fresh and good. No frills at all.

My partner & I made it to this restaurant on a Saturday 20 minutes before it was going to open. The wait didn't seem that long, but soon after we arrived to stand in line outside, people kept coming up to the point that by the opening at 5pm, the whole restaurant was full.

I cannot go to any other sushi place, as I already know it will never measure up to the luminous and infinite goodness that is The Zone.  Truly the apotheosis of sushi, the Platonic pinnacle of raw (and in the case of that mango hamachi mussel shell niblet of heaven, cooked) fish.\n\nSo it is freakin tragedy that the establishment that would so render all other sushi establishments superfluous (if not an affront) basically makes you a zombie slave to its infrastructural limitations.  Like everyone else has said: it's TEEN-EINTSY (two tables for four and maybe 6 or 7 at the bar), has a staff of three (one waitress, a chef, and a diswasher/rice maker/mussel baker/and more), and a waitlist system that causes endless amounts of anxiety ('course, that could just be the hunger talking).\n\nI understand the frustration that others have expressed about the wait--which is utterly ridiculous and entirely unavoidable--but we regulars put ourselves through this bcs, again: zombie slaves.  It is the best fucking sushi EVER, and some of us love sushi that much.  So here are some rules we've come up with to better manage the experience:\n\n1. Eat something before you go.  Seriously.  It will be two hours before you eat again, so pick an appropriate meal for your digestive pace.\n\n2. SZ opens at 5 pm.  You need to show up sometime around 4:40 pm to secure a place in line that will assure you seating among that first batch of diners.  Do not be surprised if there is already a queue when you get there.  Use that information to assess how much earlier you have to arrive next time.\n     NB: if you miss first seating (this is not an actual term, it's just how I think of it), you *might* be able to pare down your wait time if you arrive some time around 6:45 and get your name on that list pronto.  I've never tried this strategy, but it's one I've thought about after watching the ebb and flow of the dinner crowd.\n\n3. If you got seated at 5 pm, you will eat around 6:30.  Yup.  Hope you had that suggested meal.\n\n4.  Although you may not be able to help the hunger-induced cross-eyed grimace on your face, try not to glare at those seated.  Likewise, I *completely* understand the urge to linger at your table--finally getting seated feels like a darwinian victory--but just try not to be too gloaty about it.  Someone might eat you, and you could hardly blame them.\n\nI disagree with the reviewer who said SZ becomes more and more inefficient as the night wears on.  On the contrary, given their staff and space constraints, I constantly marvel at the well-honed efficiency of the organization.  The three of them NEVER STOP WORKING, and working HARD, and yet they are always pleasant and courteous and the food and drink come out just as fast as they can.  (90 minutes?!?  Um, again, remember the constraints.)\n\nIt's true that The Zone is not for everyone, and you really have to be ready to take in ALL aspects of that dining experience.  But if you know what you're getting into, and can prepare for it, you will be rewarded with sushi nirvana.  Get the spicy tuna, mango hamachi, and the Hawaiian #1 (oh god yess, the Hawaiian #1) and tell yourself your evening would have been a boring one anyway.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-03-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Mango Hamachi - really?.."], "author": "Wilson T.", "review": "This place sucks! \n\nI don't know what all the hype is, it's just another sushi restaurant. \n\nGood points: \nRestaurant is run by REAL Japanese people, not Juan Carlos and the crew. \n\nBad Points: \nWaited 2 hrs, finally got seats in front of the sushi chef.

We arrived around 6:30pm and, after we wrote our name on a little white board, we were told we had around an hour wait. There was a few bar stools for us to wait but they were all occupied so we walked around the area.

By 7:40pm, we were seated with our orders placed.\n\nWe chose two appetizers: Baked Mussels and Baked Sea Bass. Both of which were delicious but the winner was the Baked Mussels.

I think the wait serves as a necessary hurdle to filter out those who are impatient, or who didn't bring cash, or who prefer instant gratification, or who don't know any better.  It's probably not a good idea to bring people who are used to super fast service, or who are deliriously starving.\n\nSometimes I just can't make it to Sushi Zone because logistics prevent me from (gasp!) blocking out an entire evening for dinner.  And that's ok - going without one night makes me appreciate it the next time.  But there are ways to deal with the wait to make it tolerable so you can partake in this gift to San Francisco - no, to humanity itself.  I suggest:\n* enjoy a drink at Martuni's\n* put your name on the list right after work, then go home for an hour (and do whatever you can do in an hour) and come back\n* have a good conversation with your friends\n* take a walk through the Castro\n\nBut please - don't glare at those who are lucky enough to be eating - they had to wait, too, and they usually know enough to not take any longer than they have to.  We're all in this together.\n\nThe fish - whether in the maki or nigiri - has never been less than pristine for me.  My standards were set in Tokyo, at the Tsukiji fish market - I know.  My only quibble is that there is never any fatty tuna on the menu - sometimes I like to splurge.  But that's ok - the bare necessities are what make Sushi Zone shine.\n\nWhat I have enjoyed over and over:\nSea bass mango - what a friend calls 'sea bass crack' - is so fucking good... get it as an appetizer.\nSpicy hamachi maki - julienned jalepeno, lime, and avocado - amazing!\nSalmon skin maki - salty goodness!\nSaba nigiri - my very high mackerel standards are always met here\nSalmon (sake) nigiri - always great (best with slice of lime)\nHawaiian #2 maki - like a party in your mouth and everyone's invited\nSpicy mussels maki - like its hamachi brother above - amazing\nSpider maki - probably the most expensive thing on the menu, and worth it\nBaked salmon w/shitake - I've only had this when I'm sure I won't go without the sea bass crack - very tasty\n\nI've always had excellent service here - and by that I mean courteous, pleasant, and happy to see you.  If you can get there early, great.  If not - it's gonna be ok - sit back, relax, and enjoy the best sushi in SF for the price.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-06-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Same goes with the Stuffed Shitake w/ Salmon and the Stuffed Jalapeno w/ Albacore (which I wish were spicy).

First come, first served. \n\nThis place is pretty damn orgasmic. Be sure to write your name and party size on the white board located near the furthest booth from the entrance. If you don't have the patience to wait or don't like the sush here, I'd hit you with a chopstick, but I won't. Less people means less of a wait. I contemplated writing a review for Sushi Zone. No matter how much I want to share this goodness with the world, wouldn't it be nice to keep this place a secret?\n\nFirst time I came here it was 630pm, put our names down and waited, and waited, and waited till we couldn't wait anymore! FYI, don't come here after 5pm and hungry. It's torture to watch one person or two enjoying their sushi while everyone else is waiting for theirs either sitting or waiting to be seated, and there you are knowing you won't be able to eat for another hour or two. Thank goodness for Hunan Garden next door. Read review on Hunan Garden.\n\nSecond visit, I came here around 5. This time I stayed, and waited about an hour to eat. OMG!!! Sooo gooood! I can understand why people are willing to wait patiently even though the wait isn't so pleasant. I come here religiously and always before they open. Now if I can only do the same with Catholicism. Get here at 5, and there's a line. You could  always put your name down, grab drinks around the corner and come back in an hour. Don't forget the cash!\n\nEverything's pretty dang delish. The Baked Striped Bass w/ Mango comes in 2 pieces- I'll bet you can't just have one! Same goes with the Stuffed Shitake w/ Salmon and the Stuffed Jalapeno w/ Albacore (which I wish were spicy). The Spicy Mussel roll is good but again, not spicy.  The Spicy Mango Salmon, Spicy Albacore, and Spicy Hamachi (I like the slice of lime in this roll) are really good. A popular roll and definitely a favorite is the Hawaiian #2- Albacore, Mango, Macadamia Nuts. \n\nOmg, I'm having withdrawals and it's only been 3 days since I've been here last.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-06-02"}, {"excerpts": ["We got the stuffed shitake mushroom caps stuffed with baked salmon and some delicious sauce thing.

This restaurant is about the size of my living room..literally. There are two tables and one long counter top space which could house about 20 people max. There is usually a long wait for this place if you don't come at the right times because it is so small. Come at 5 when it opens and then every hr and half thereafter to avoid long waits. Since my friend is a regular there he knew the exact time frame we should arrive so we didn't have to wait at all. There is only one sushi chef so the food can take some time to prepare. We ordered a few appetizers to start but I could only remember the shitake mushroom with salmon because it was mui excellente!..and I'm not being bias because i am a salmon lover.
