Once we ordered, a bus full of Indian tourists walk in and the place is a mad house! The server told us they've been getting busses of hungry tourists almost every day for the past few months, great for business!\n\nGreat India offers buffet dinner, as well as a la carte options.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nGarlic Naan - warm and doughy, not overpowering garlic flavors.\nBaigan Aloo - Eggplant cooked with potatoes and fresh tomatoes\nLamb Biryani - Indian bashmati rice cooked with lamb, nuts, spices (this dish has powerful flavors and can get a little spicy so make sure you get water!)\nVegetarian Samosa - Crispy Puffs Filled With Potatoes and Green Peas\n\nOverall, service was fantastic even after the big group showed up. I think we were fortunate to always have water refills and the food came out relatively quickly. The food was great, I have no major complaints.\n\nGentle reminder: maybe take the Geary 38 line (or bike over) to avoid the horrible parking in this neighborhood.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-07-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered three entrees (aloo gobi, baigan aloo, veggie biryani), two appetizers (veggie samosas and the veggie pakora) and naan.

Hey, it was a Tuesday night, and we wanted something entertaining to do. \n \nIn search of Indian food, we consulted Yelp, and the only place we could find along the 38 line in the general vicinity of our destination was Great India.  It was only 3.5 stars, so I was a little nervous.  Even more nervous when we walked in, and there wasn't a customer in sight.  I attributed it to the location - it's way the f--- out there.\n \nGlad we risked it; everything was actually pretty great (between 3.5 and 4 stars, but I'm rounding up).  I ordered a Bud Light, and it was only $2.75.  Sister ordered a mango juice, and it was delish - pure fresh mango.  Next, they brought us out that flat, cracker like \"bread.\" (no, I'm not talking about naan).  With that came four dipping sauces ' chutneys, all perfect complements to each other - two spicy, two sweet, all very tasty.\n \nWe ordered a naan that I'd never heard of - cherry, cinnamon, and some other sweetness.  We were feeling adventurous!  As far as naan goes, it was good, and a little different in texture than what's normal (at least in my naan world).  I'm used to naan being soft and stretchy, but it was kind of crispy / flaky on the outside, and soft (and sweet) on the inside.  \n \nThe main entrees - I had the paneer tikka masala (cheese with masala sauce) - again, between 3.5 and 4 stars.  Very good, especially when I dipped the naan in it.  My sister had the mushroom korma, and that too was delightful.
