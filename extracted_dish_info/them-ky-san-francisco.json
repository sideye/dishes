Now, I don't know what makes places do the different slices of tendon, but I know that in the end, it does make a difference when it comes to texture and eating enjoyment.  The tendon today was not so good.  But there was a lot of it.  But it was sliced thin.  \n\nThe steak I ordered on the side.  See that?  I'm growing up.  I'm eating my pho in a deconstructed manner that would make top chef cringe.  This platter of beautiful RED RED RED RED REDRUM REDRUM!!!  steak beautiful color bright red.  It was a generous serving and it was bright red!  I mention this because i've been served \"dull red\" and even \"red with splotches of brown!\"  The things that one takes for granted, like red meat.  That is still red.\n\nThe broth was good today.  It was not the deep color of Nam something something something.  It was a clear.  And when I remembered to take a sip before corrupting it with basil, it had a singing clarity that was once reserved for small italian boys.

This is not a place to bring a date or to find decent services, but I'm always assured to have a pure a hole in the wall comfort food experience. In my previous visits the server was always absent minded and won't pay attention unless I was with a big party. But in exchange I find them offering one of the most dynamic menus when compare to similar types of pho restaurants. \n\nMore importantly their food lives up to its billing as I find their pho tai gan ($6) and dac biet xe lua ($6.45) top notch and hard to beat. I have had their pho with rare beef and tendon several times. The broth is always rich and flavorful anchored by a nice depth of bone marrow taste. The soup is served very hot so that their still firm noodles and rare beef and buttery tendon can be appropriately steeped with fresh servings of jalapenos, sprouts and basil leafs. It's hard to imagine a more complete bowl of pho. Whereas some places have their soup base inconsistent from opening to closing, my experiences here have been as good as it gets regardless whether I was here for brunch, late lunch or last night's dinner.

I must try their taro pancake with eggs ($6) for my next visit, among a whole slew of other interesting dishes that I have mentally bookmarked.

Not too hard or too soft.\n\nBun Bo Hue- The spicy pork soup is yummmmmy! I love the thinkly slice cabbage, lime, and herb condiment that it comes with. You get thinly slice pork and blood cubes. If you didn't grow up eating it then it won't be for you. You can ask for it w/o and save them some money on waste. I tried bun bo hue in other restaurants but this is one of my favorite.\n\nBBQ Meat (of your choice), shredded pork, and eggloaf over rice- A wonderful dish if you want to get full. I love it because of the variety on the place. Comes with the sweet, garlic, lime-chili dipping sauce and sliced cucumbers and tomatoes.  You can also get it with grilled shrimp or pork chop and egg rolls.\n\nLastly I love the grilled chicken over rice. Deliciously marinated and grilled hot and served over rice with dipping sauce and pickled carrots and diakon. If you love chicken this is the dish for you! Another variation I like is the steamed chicken over rice that comes with ginger oil. You can drink that stuff!

I've been to several places in San Francisco and West LA where the soup was either sweet or diluted, beef was already well done, side dish of sprouts were unclean and not fresh, or somehow certain key ingredients were skipped over. You won't find any of those weak links here in your piping hot bowl of pho.\n\nI come here a lot. This is not a place to bring a date or to find decent services, but I'm always assured to have a pure a hole in the wall comfort food experience. In my previous visits the server was always absent minded and won't pay attention unless I was with a big party. But in exchange I find them offering one of the most dynamic menus when compare to similar types of pho restaurants. \n\nMore importantly their food lives up to its billing as I find their pho tai gan ($6) and dac biet xe lua ($6.45) top notch and hard to beat. I have had their pho with rare beef and tendon several times. The broth is always rich and flavorful anchored by a nice depth of bone marrow taste. The soup is served very hot so that their still firm noodles and rare beef and buttery tendon can be appropriately steeped with fresh servings of jalapenos, sprouts and basil leafs. It's hard to imagine a more complete bowl of pho. Whereas some places have their soup base inconsistent from opening to closing, my experiences here have been as good as it gets regardless whether I was here for brunch, late lunch or last night's dinner.  We are talkin' about smackin' pho power with tons of street cred straight out of the Tenderloin.\n\nIf you are ever tempted to get an appetizer, try their egg roll with shredded pork rolls with lettuce ($5.50). It comes with two huge spring rolls tightly wrapped with layers of lettuce, shredded pork and crunchy delicious Vietnamese egg rolls at the core. This was one of the most unique and delicious rolls I've tried. In my previous visits I also enjoyed their com ga hap Hai Nam ($6.45) and com bi cha suon nuong ($6.45). I thought the Hai Nan chicken was really great with their rice nicely seasoned, and although the pork chop was decent, I've also had it better at Pho 99 in Daily City. The only item that I would not recommend is their oxtail over rice which I thought was too boney and the stew itself was dry and not very flavorful. \n\nThe culmination of these experiences leading up to last night made this my go-to place for pho. I must try their taro pancake with eggs ($6) for my next visit, among a whole slew of other interesting dishes that I have mentally bookmarked. Aside from the service, my only complaints are their super hot tea that makes the cup hard to hold and their chopsticks are not the cleanest.
