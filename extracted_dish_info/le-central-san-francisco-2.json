It's loud, boistrous, and the seating arrangements border on claustrophobic.\n\nDuck rillettes.  Two words that keep me coming back.  Oh, that... and \"duck aspic\".  Which is served cubed and generously scattered across the serving plate... When no one is looking, I scoop a few pieces into my mouth, and let my tongue play over them as they yield and melt across my taste buds.  \n\nWhy can't I buy duck-flavored jello at the store?  \n\nThis gorgeous slab of decadent... duckness... liberally spread across sliced table bread and sprinkled with some gelee... followed by a mini-bite of cornichon is as close to lunch-hour heaven as it gets.  For $7.50, and without risking a misdemeanor, that is.  \n\nAnd that's my appetizer!  I also adore the leeks vinaigrette, the sexy salad nicoise and when I'm feeling like a splurge (which is often) I'll have the Crab Cake Beurre Blanc.  \n\nThe latter is a portly, fist-sized crustacean-cake that arrives crisped and coated lightly in bread crumbs... basking in a freshly-poured puddle of buerre blanc.  While this item is listed as an appetizer, if you start with something else... and share a few bites of your fellow diner's dishes... the crab cake can serve as an entree. \n\nI, personally am over tiny little appetizers... like the \"lobster ceviche\" that I ordered at Nobu back in 1999 for $20 and was nothing more than a short stack of tortilla chips with a paltry sprinkling of dry lobster crumbs between them. Not that I'm holding a grudge or anything.  \n\nOkay - back to my crab cake:  it's refreshingly free of fillers and chunks of not-crab.  It is perfect with a swipe of the beurre blanc and should be consumed reverently, at a leisurely pace.  \n\nSo... maybe this place is a bit stodgy... but between the authentic bistro fare, which includes seasonal delicacies and a charcuterie selection that never leaves me wanting... I always hit that gustatory sweet spot.  \n\nLook for me if you stop by for lunch; I'll be the only other person who doesn't have an AARP membership, blissfully attending to my rillette or pate de campagne.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-02-20"}], "mussels marini\u00e8re": [], "lescargot bourguignon": [], "onion soup gratin\u00e9e": [{"excerpts": ["Onion Soup Gratin\u00e9e was OK but Escargots de Bourgogne was over the top... and the Souffle Glacee was exceptional"], "author": "William T.", "review": "wife and I went to set menu as part of restaurant week.  as so many others have said, the Cassoulet was to die for but so was the Beef Bourguignon!  the appetizers Onion Soup Gratin\u00e9e was OK but Escargots de Bourgogne was over the top... and the Souffle Glacee was exceptional", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-19"}], "foie gras terrine": [], "roasted fresh beets": [], "belgian endive": [{"excerpts": ["Excellent pate, lovely Belgian endive.

A friend and I wanted to meet up to commemorate another great year and so we looked on the website to see what affordable options that were out there that sounded good but also didn't break our wallets and we found a really solid option with Le Central.   \n\nUpon entry I noticed that Le Central could resemble a local watering hole in any American city or small local restaurant in Paris. It was cozy and warm without coming across as too pretentious. There was a huge long bar on one side of a double sided restaurant with small two top tables and booths abound. As for their menu they seem to have a number of dishes that best represent the best of what Parisian flair has to offer. Their San Francisco Restaurant Week menu best exemplifies some of the dishes they serve at a fairly decent price point. Where else could you get Escargot, Beef Bourguignon, and a Chocolate Mousse for only forty dollars total? No where in San Francisco outside of that ten day period every January.\n\nSince this was SF Restaurant Week and we were here to take advantage of the meal deal they were offering up I had to go with the traditional Onion Soup Gratinee with a boatload of Gruyere cheese and herb croutons this starter was just the way I like my French Onion Soup, gooey and cheesy.
