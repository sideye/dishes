I was really pleased with Takara on my previous visits, and it had become my favorite sashimi restaurant.  I came in from Sacramento to eat here.\n\nI have to downgrade my rating because the sashimi was SO disappointing this visit. The presentation and quality of the fish was just awful compared to what it was before.  The fish was cut sloppily and seemed thrown in the chirashi box. All of the elements (fish, shiso garnish, etc) were there, but there was no care for how it looked - it was just hunks of meat in a box. Takara, did you get a new sushi chef?  What happened?  I'm so sad.\n\nThe quality of the tuna (maguro) was the most disappointing.  The texture was mealy and crumbly - marginally better quality than what you would get with sushi at an American supermarket or an all you can eat pan-Asian buffet.  Ick. The other fish were just ok, but what I would expect from a $10 chirashi instead of the $17 we paid.  None of the fish, except for the salmon (sake), which is super fatty anyway, had that \"melt in your mouth\" quality that I looked forward to with the sashimi at Takara.\n\nTo be fair, the ebi and the tamago were pretty good still, and the tako was cooked nicely as usual (tender, not horrible and rubbery like at most places).\n\nMy aunt said that sashimi is out of season, so maybe I should cut Takara some slack, but it doesn't explain the crappy presentation of the food. Also, if the food continues to be this mediocre, then the so-so service needs to improve to make up for it (waitress from Japan with blond hair - I'm talking about you).

Something that can't be missed is their chawan mushi (savory egg custard), which comes with most of their set meals. I'd also add kamameshi (rice pots) and chazuke (tea over rice) are both comfort foods that I think are relatively rare finds in restaurants here.\n\nThe service ... has character.
