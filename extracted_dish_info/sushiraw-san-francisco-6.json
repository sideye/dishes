After the 2013 Color Run, our party of 5 was craving something light for lunch (or so we thought). We had planned on dining at Sushi Zen, but our hunger got the best of us--the more convenient, eye-catching Sushi Raw got our business.\n\nDespite the affordable lunch specials, we decided to go family style with 4 rolls and some Big Discount items (described below).\n\nWe first chose the ISLAND ROLL with tuna, salmon, and yellow tail wrapped with cucumber, 6 pieces for $12.99 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VoBBC_Z9yH2uIaZQhzsexQ/l.jpg). The combination was refreshing, although the cucumber was not that crisp and the fish were not markedly fresh. Since this is a light roll, eat this first because its flavor can be easily overpowered!\n\nNext was the FOUR SEASONS ROLL with eel, imitation crab, and avocado topped with tuna and avocado, 8 pieces for $12.99 (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d71TaWul4vjL-oIbw2uc3w/l.jpg). This was my favorite by far...EXCEPT FOR THE WASABI SAUCE. AUGH. They drizzle it on top with the other sauces, but because I have an aversion to wasabi, it totally killed my palate :(\n\nThird was the TARAVAL STREET ROLL with eel, shrimp tempura, imitation crab meat, cilantro, and mango, topped with tobiko, 6 pieces for $8.99 (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5fGG2OQ6tgVzHbvU6WNoiQ/l.jpg). This is a good, reliable roll, though the mango is not very noticeable. Gotta love that shrimp tempura though!\n\nLast was the HOT SUMMER ROLL with spicy tuna topped with crab meat, salmon, and baked with spicy sauce and tobiko, 8 pieces for $12.99 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/chB1j_Q8rzFnGwu7a_iVxA/l.jpg). The stringy red things on top were very interesting texture-wise, but the crab meat and spicy tuna overpowered the subtlety of the salmon.\n\nFor every $15 ordered off the regular menu, you get the option to choose an item off the Big Discount menu (borrowing Jessica C's picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-raw-san-francisco-3?select=GbuCLrQRKTIfUm9ue_ZgzQ#93Snh8xG0eUMkiLS4qRc9w). Since we had ordered over $45, we chose 3 items: UNAGI HAND ROLL for $1 (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MzsP_bAr1K-0v-IZyN005g/l.jpg), SPICY TUNA HAND ROLL for $1 (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OEtkgaDNi7yYFJ8muZH78g/l.jpg), and SEAWEED SALAD for $2, normally $4.99. The spicy tuna was fantastic.\n\nOur total bill was $52, which came out to $13 per person. After a morning of colorrific running that cost each of us $50, having a decent lunch at less than a third of that price was pretty good.

A bit overpriced (I'd opt to go Shimo or Okazu Ya since one has bigger cuts for the same price while the other is cheaper), but hell, its open late... \n\nThe tuna rolls were pretty normal, but good. The fish was of good quality and the rice texture was decent. Looking at the fish in the display, those were of also good quality. My gripe is on the price of their fish, which is kind of expensive for what you're getting \n\nI ordered the Salmon Teriyaki rice plate while my friend ordered the Saba Shioyaki. Both are pretty much grilled fish with some rice, salad and miso.\n\nThe miso was your standard miso soup... didn't have any green onions which was sad for me, but it tasted pretty normal. Nothing amazing, but then again I've never had amazing miso soup.\n\nThe salad was whatever. Didn't care so much for the dressing on it. Tasted almost like an Italian dressing or something\n\nThe salmon and saba portions were perfect for a post work out meal or just for any person who's trying to eat right. They both were grilled nicely and lightly seasoned. The saba also did not have as fishy a flavor as other saba that I've tried, which gets plus points in my book.\n\nThe rice is also of perfect portion control.  We opted for the sushi rice because it tastes better.\n\nOverall this place is ok. A bit overpriced for what you're getting but its an awesome late night spot to eat at for  the health conscious plus the portion control is good. I only wish they had brown rice. Since it is a healthy late night spot, I'll probably come back.

Initially, we were impressed with the attentive and friendly service, tastiness of the entrees and the good value.  Unfortunately, the restaurant has gone downhill until the final straw when we felt they no longer valued our business and walked out of the restaurant (more about that later).  As stated, our initial experiences were very positive.  Portions were generous and the service was attentive and friendly.  However, we slowly noticed a deterioration of the service, friendliness and the food.  For example, when we ordered the tonkatsu bento, we would receive two cutlets.  But more recently, it has been reduced to a single cutlet.  Although probably  better for us in the long run, we felt that we were treated inconsistently.  The final straw was when we (party of 4) arrived around 6 pm on a Friday evening.
