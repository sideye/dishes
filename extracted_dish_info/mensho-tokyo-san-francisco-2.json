I was totally pumped and ready to love it.\n\nTo start, I went there prepared to wait in line. Reviews advised that the wait would be around 30 minutes, ours was a bit closer to 40 but we did go around 7:00pm, prime dinner time, I guess! Fortunately the wait time gave us time to peruse the menu and decide what to order. I am thankful that the menu is not overwhelmingly long, but there were several interesting options so I had to choose carefully.\n\nOnce we got in, we could tell that the space is small, fitting maybe 20-25 people, which does explain the lineup. It has a nice cozy charm to it though, with a type of communal seating, and wall decor. Somehow it made the experience feel more authentic and worth the wait. This might not be ideal for some people looking for an intimate or private meal.\n\nWe decided to try the Enoki mushroom chips to start. I have absolutely zero regrets here- they were freakin' delicious! In fact, I would have been perfectly satisfied with a bowl of these for dinner! They're kind of like crispy onion strings you can get on burgers, same texture... but the flavour is just yummy. Disclaimer: I am a bit of a mushroom fanatic, so if you don't like mushrooms, these might not be for you.\n\nAfter much deliberation and recommendations from our server, I ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen (double chashu) which is what they are known for.

Super tender and packed full of flavour. I loved it. The noodles were also done well. Not too soft, but not too hard, just what I expected. Unfortunately that is where my enjoyment ends. \n\nI won't fault the restaurant for it, but apparently I am not much of a miso fan and maybe I'm just not that into ramen, even though I really wanted to be! I did enjoy the overall experience, and will say that even though there was a bit of a mishap with my soup- our server worked quickly with her manager to rectify the situation, which I always do appreciate.\n\nOverall- if you like ramen, definitely come check it out.

But just because I don't believe LeBron is the best doesn't mean I do not respect his greatness.\n\nSo what's this got to do with Mensho? Before y'all report this review as irrelevant, let me explain. First off, I understand the hype around this restaurant. Overall, the food was tasty, atmosphere felt chill, and service seemed efficient. But, just like how I feel about LeBron, I didn't think Mensho was the best ramen shop ever. Nevertheless, I have to admit that this place was legit!\n\nComing into Mensho, I had actually thought this restaurant would have a limited amount of choices. In my experience, well-established ramen joints usually specialize in only a few dishes. One look at their menu and it was clear that I was wrong. Mensho has at least 8 distinct kinds of ramen - each unique in its own way. The broth that immediately caught my attention was the Tori Paitan; although I usually don't care for a chicken-based broth, I've heard amazing things about Mensho's rendition. For those of ya'll who can eat a horse, this restaurant also serves two appetizers and double meat/extra toppings can be added to any ramen. Plus, the list of drinks is almost as large as the number of food items! In terms of pricing, Mensho is definitely on the higher end. Ramen here can cost anywhere from $14-$20 not including tax+tip. \n\nI ended up ordering the Spicy Tori Paitan and my girlfriend got the regular Tori Paitan. Here's what we thought: \n\n-- GOOD, BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE --\nTo put it bluntly, the ramen here was great but definitely not what we expected. For both our bowls, the sheer quality of our ingredients - the texture of the noodles, melt-in-your-mouth softness of the meat, and freshness of the toppings - was unrivaled. However, when it came to the broth we felt like it was WAY TOO CREAMY. I LOVE thick af soup, but the Paitain broth tasted more like a sauce than anything else. \n\n-Spicy Tori Paitan (8/10): Besides the consistency of the broth, I really enjoyed this bowl. The spicy miso definitely added some heat (was sweating!), the cabbage was fresh, and I felt like they gave a decent amount of noodles. On the other hand, I wished that I got more than 1-2 pieces of Chasu - especially if I'm paying $20 (including tax+tip).\n\n-Tori Paitan (7/10): Protip for everyone...Tori Paitan is SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT compared to the spicy version. For example, the regular one has both pork and duck. On my girlfriend's end, she echoed the same sentiments I had about my Spicy Tori. Creamy soup aside, she really loved the Chasu (very soft and flavorful) as well as the noodles. \n\n-- SMALL, BUT HOSPITABLE ATMOSPHERE -- \nAlthough the size of Mensho was SUPER TINY (can only fit like 20 people max at one time?), the restaurant made up for this with a really welcoming environment. For instance, I loved the lighting, the decor was beautiful, and they even had coat hangers/boxes for bags that helped save space. Ironically, the bathroom was big too! My favorite part had to be the setup. Every table is essentially communal, and it may force you to interact with your neighbor; some may hate this, but I was all for it.\n\n-- FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT SERVICE -- \nEvery employee was super kind and very quick to respond. Even with the large crowds, we were able to take as long as we needed to eat without ever feeling rushed. \n\n-- LONGER WAIT THAN THE DMV -- \nIf you ever want to try this place you better get here BEFORE THEY OPEN (5pm Tuesday-Sunday). We stopped by around 5:10pm and still had to wait ~30 minutes to get in. Also, don't bother showing up with more than four people unless you have all night.\n\nWhen planning a trip here, I encourage y'all to take advantage of San Francisco's public transportation system because parking/driving around this area SUCKS. The restaurant is half a mile from Powell St. BART, and there are plenty of bus lines along/near Geary. I will feel bad for you if you end up spending 30 minutes trying to find parking and then having to wait another hour to be seated.\n\nAll in all, I find that Mensho Tokyo is really for individuals who love a super thick broth in their ramen - at least when it comes to most of their options. For me personally, I enjoyed my first time here. Despite the wait, it was worth it to say that I finally had a chance to eat at Mensho. But for the price and some of the nitpicky things, I probably wouldn't come back often. I give Mensho Tokyo a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. Itadakimasu!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-02-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We were able to try the Tori Paitan and of course the Matcha Tori Paitan.

Mensho Tokyo has had such a good reputation in terms of the quality of their food and the atmosphere of their restaurant. They have a very modern, communal design for their restaurant that gives off a very at-home vibe for their customers. They also have an automatic service charge since they are a gratuity free establishment!\n\nWe were able to try the Tori Paitan and of course the Matcha Tori Paitan. You can definitely tell why they're the crowd favorites. The broth was SO rich and creamy, the noodles were better than anything we've had anywhere else, and the meat was melt in your mouth good. \n\nWe arrived an hour before closing on a Tuesday night and there was about a 10 min wait (which is not bad at all especially since were expecting a much longer wait). One thing to note is that it was a pretty cold night so my friends and I went inside to wait inside the restaurant for a little bit. A server acknowledged us and told us that it will be a couple of minutes and we should be seated soon. Before we got a chance to go back out, another server saw us and condescendingly told us to go outside since we weren't allowed to wait inside. Our apologies, we've never been there before and we were cold. \n\nOther than the weird customer service hiccup, highly recommend Mensho Tokyo!", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-02-21"}, {"excerpts": ["For food I went with the Spicy Tori Paitan Ramen with double chashu each time.

I heard it's super crazy when they first open, but I waited until after 8PM on both occasions and went by myself for easier seating. By doing this, the wait was always less than 15 minutes before I snagged a spot. If you go in a group of two, the wait wont be as bad, but if you try to come with more than that, then good luck - you might be there for a while.\n\nBecause the place is small, single eaters will be sat wherever there is space. That means if a party of five is having a dinner full of inside jokes, guess who's the creepy uncle in the corner quietly trying not to make eye contact. I didn't mind. Just buried my face into one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had.\n\nFor food I went with the Spicy Tori Paitan Ramen with double chashu each time. The first round I forgot to order an egg, the second time I wasn't so careless. The broth had a good kick and it had an amazing creamy texture.

One bowl is plenty and you'll be sweating out all those amazing spices for the next 24 hours. Worth it.\n\nIf you have some time to kill and you don't mind waiting for your food, I highly recommend Menhso.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-01-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the tori paitan ramen and it was good.

Plus it's marinated perfectly and that first bite of the marinated egg white and half cooked york is really memorable.\n\nMy friend and I also shared the poke soba ($18) as we were intrigued by the 10 bowl limit per day, but I would recommend skipping this. Because it was called poke soba, I thought all the proteins in the dish would be seafood, but for some reason there was also chashu in there.

It's very different than most places that I've been to. The Tori Paitan hit the spot! The broth was rich and bursting with so much flavor. It's a bit on the thicker side than what I'm use to, but that's because of the the way they make their chicken broth. I think they blend like actual chicken into their broth to make the flavor pop. It's great! It also comes with pork chashu and duck chashu -- both were very tender and juicy. It even had kale in it (definitely a Bay Area thing).\n\nThe enoki mushrooms were fantastic as well. I've never had enoki deep fried before. It was a yummy snack to eat before our ramen bowls came out. Crispy and bomb.\n\nGreat place for a ramen fix.

Why not give out numbers? Customers literally cannot go do something else while waiting, and it's a big time waste. Why force wasting of (a LOT of people's) time? To prove what, exactly? I'm fine with waiting, but I'm not fine with a restaurant being so arrogant to force its customers to mandatorily wait in a line. The only reasons I can think of for this is: a) marketing - if there's a lot of people waiting, it must be good so let's convince even more people to waste their time to wait in line to eat at this place! and b) efficiency - if people are readily available, the restaurant can immediately seat people when a table clears out. Reason a is just selfish. Reason b can be solved by warning customers that if they're not there when they're called, they will be skipped over/crossed out. Or better yet, they can actually invest in a good technology system of calling/texting people. A bunch of restaurants have this, and I very much appreciate places that do. PLEASE change your must-wait-in-line policy. It's just selfish, arrogant, and wastes a LOT of people's time. Making people sign in on a sheet of paper or with one of the waiters/waitresses is fine; don't have to get all fancy with technology.

The broth was good, but a tad too salty for what I am used to. If you want your egg it is an up charge. The noodle was what ruined the experience. All the ramen place I had in Japan had this soft yet bouncy texture to their noodles which were all made from scratch. Here I got this thick and undercooked doughy noodle, nothing that reminded me of Japan. \nMy friend got the shio ramen and didn't feel it was any more special than other ramen places around.\nWe won't be making our way back considering the price, and the not so great area that it located in as well.", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-05-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Tori Paitan Ramen soup was rich and creamy.

Probably because it's so thick, dense, and creamy. One of the best broths I've ever tasted in my life! I remember my shoyu ramen had pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, bamboo shoots, and some microgreens. The pork chashu was soooo fatty it melted in my mouth. I liked it but, I prefer it to be more meaty. \n\nOverall, I thought it was delicious. I didn't mind how cramped it was but if you have major claustrophobia then maybe this isn't for you.

It was very unappealing. \n\nI dug in, a bit apprehensive but still eager. My first impressions was like I was eating cardboard drenched in fat. It was rich, it was heavy. But it had no flavor. It was more texture than substance.  The noodles were about the only thing they did well. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente, thick, wavy and filling. I just wish the broth had a but more flavor. I added pepper, without avail. It just couldn't be recovered. I left disappointed with a unsatisfied tongue and empty stomach and an even emptier pocket. \n\nBottom line is the place is cramped, very intimate you barely have any room, the service is surgical and efficient.

Although there wasn't a lot of decoration, I've noticed some coffee brewers along the glass that allows you to see the kitchen. The first thing I noticed when I walked in were coat hangers but no one seems to be using them. The restaurant is very small with bar top tables and not much space to put your belongings (carry shopping bags was a bad idea). There isn't a lot of room for seating, everyone seems to be squished.

The Spicy Tori Paitan ramen that I got was $17 and the spicy lamb was $16. The portion size was like any other ramen shop but it is super filling because of the broth. I would say that it is worth every penny of your money because the ramen is just that good. \n\nCustomer Service: 2.5/5 I feel like I didn't really receive much customer service while I was her. The waitresses all seem super busy to even notice us. Our server just brought over some water, took our order, and brought out the ramen.

Thank god, my friend got there earlier than me around 5ish and got a seat 5mins later. \n\nRAMEN:\nWe ordered: \n1) Tori Paitan (single chasu) $16: super creamy chicken and pork broth and really thick and chewy noodles with a pinch of cabbage and 2 duck chasus, No egg :( The broth was perfectly flavored and a little on the creamier side but not too oily or salty. \n2) Spicy Lamb $16: This was SO SALTY. It tasted like they dunk 10 packs of spicy msg ramen packs in the broth. There were bits of ground lamb and bean sprouts mixed in. I felt like the overly saltiness of the broth toke away the enjoyment of the ramen overall. \n\nOthers:\nThey also have small appetizers and other types of ramen including: no broth ramen, shio and shoyu and a vegan ramen! No Tonkatsu (although I think Tori Paitan is closest to it but a bit more heavy). They advertise for Tsukemen (dipping) Ramen on their walls, but don't actually have it on their menu which is a little misleading.

Cute decor though! \n\nSERVICE: \nVery fast and attentive! \n\nVERDICT:\nFor flavors and thick chewy noodles I give them a 5!

One day, I noticed a long line of people waiting outside the Alcazar Theatre and wondered what the hoopla was all about. It suddenly clicked that this was one of the most anticipated opening of a Ramen shop straight from Japan. \n\nChef and owner Tomoharu Shono's Mensho Tokyo is one of many restaurants he owns in Japan, and this is the first restaurant opened outside of Japan. I think it's fitting he chose San Francisco as we have been starved of good, authentic Ramen for so long. Most of my \"best Ramen experience\" so far have been in L.A., Vegas and the Peninsula. \n\nDuring the next couple months while walking pass this place, I would often gauge at the line and figured it would eventually die down but that never happened. So this past Sunday, I tried to convince the Wifey to get here early prior to their opening time, but she didn't want to \"waste\" time waiting in line and instead we got here around 7PM. You gotta have patience and brave the crackheads and crazies if you want some good Ramen and it better be worth it....and it was. \n\nAfter about an hour, we finally got seated and we both had the Tori Paitan Ramen (Double Chasu) and Oysters in Dare Oil, the only appetizer they served. The oysters had a subtle smoky and soy sauce flavor that was quite delightful, but may be an acquired taste for some. The Ramen is a creamy mixture of chicken soup with two slices of pork belly, two slices of duck breast, menma (bamboo shoots), burdock, kale and Katsuobushi sauce. \n\nThe broth of the Ramen was thick, rich, creamy that was not too overpowering and it was quite an exquisite flavor bursting of umami. The noodles were thicker and cooked al dente to which I thoroughly enjoyed as it had a good snap to it. Now, had this been in Japan, I would have been slurping the noodles as the technique aerates the noodles and the broth, allowing the flavors to mellow out and fully develop before you chew and swallow. It also cools off your mouthful of noodles just enough to let you enjoy them while the rest of the bowl stays piping hot.\n\nHowever....I couldn't get myself to do it since we are in a communal table. I was tempted to, but this ain't Japan and I wanted to eat \"politely\" to the rest of the patrons eating beside me. Regardless, we were enjoying our bowls of Ramen as these were right up there with some of the best we've had so far. \n\nSide note: I did some researching on the Chef and I am excited to see what bold new flavors he can come up with next. There's a particular lamb-based broth he made in Japan and wonder if he can recreate that here. He also can't make the same exact broths as he would like here due to health codes and regulations.

As a fellow Yelper suggested, I arrived a little after 5PM to avoid the hour long wait. I got here around 5:30PM and found parking right around the block. When I got in line at around 5:30PM, there were approximately 5-6 groups ahead of us in line. As I studied the restaurant through their window, I realized they only had 3 large tables that seated roughly 6-10 people and a counter in the back facing the kitchen, which seated around 4. The walls had descriptions of the growing popularity of the cuisine and its origin. There were TV screens displaying clips of ramen chefs, ramen eaters and soft music playing in the background.

The noodles resembled the shape of Maruchan ramen, but the noodles are way better in quality, thickness and consistency. \n\nThe enoki chips were one of a kind because I have never seen it on any other menu in San Francisco. Comes with a side of chili powder and black sesame seeds. The taste reminded me of crispy hash browns. I definitely enjoyed the odd associations that came with ordering the enoki chips, because it also reminded me eating enoki mushrooms during hot pot too. xD\n\nI think Mensho Tokyo absolutely deserves 4-5 stars, but there is always room for improvement.

Overall, i just found it quite lacking.\n\nThe three criteria which I usually judge quality ramen are:\n\n1. Noodles - cooked with a bit of bite to it, similar to al dente\n2. The broth - flavorful and compliments the noodles and toppings\n3. The soft boil egg - a staple to most ramen, and shows how well the place cooks their food.\n\nNow, to put these criteria to the test.\n\n1. Mensho have some great ramen noodles.

The noodles are nice & thick but very soft AND chewy.  You can tell tell they're handmade noodles!!!  The texture is great but I think the best thing about these noddles is the fact that the broth flavor sticks to the noodles very well, making your bite that much more flavorful.  Most ramen places I go to, I'm that guy eating the noddles with chopsticks AND spoon like I'm eating a bowl of pho, trying to eat the noodles while enjoying the flavor of the broth.  Well, you don't need to do that here.  The broth flavor sticks very well to the nice thick noodles so you can enjoy your bowl how you're supposed to.\n\nWhat's also amazing about this place is that the broth is not overly salty like other places where you have to drink a gallon of water to keep yourself hydrated from all that salt.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is about the broth but it's very flavorful without being overly salty.\n\nI'm not going to act like this is my regular ramen place I've been eating at for the past 5 years but I highly recommend the Tori Paitan which comes with pork & duck meat!  I am not a big fan of duck meat but TRUST ME!!!  You have to try it!  The lamb ramen was really good also.  Again, I'm not a big fan of lamb but you really have to try it!!!

We waited in line for about 1.5 hour which honestly isn't that bad since Mensho is pretty small inside. So keep in mind it's not friendly for groups. As the line started to move once their doors opened and people were filling up the tables, my friends and I were so close to getting in and we were close to making the cut.\n\nWhile anxiously waiting we browsed through their menu and as people were leaving, we asked what they got which made the decision process a lot easier. Finally we got seated by this counter seating which was fine. We got to see the chefs in action and it was interesting to see the process of it all. I had ordered the Clam Butter Chashu Ramen since I've never seen anywhere serve clams with ramen. My friends got the Tori Paitan Ramen with Duck Chashu and the Spicy Lamb Chashu Ramen. We ordered the Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil, which was really yummy. There was enough pieces for the 3 of us to try and to hold off our appetite as we patiently waited for our ramen.\n\nOnce our ramen had arrived, we tried each other's broths. The ones that my friends ordered had a creamy broth and it was so savory and delicious. My broth was lighter but still delicious. At first when I tried the broth for my ramen, it had a strong seafood taste but after mixing that whipped butter and all the other ingredients in my bowl together, there was a huge shift in the taste of my broth. It was much more flavorful and that strong seafood taste was masked...probably by the butter but I'm not complaining. The noodles in my ramen were a bit different from my friends but they were so fresh and tasty. So delicious!\n\nThe service was alright. Had to flag down a server a few times to get more water. They were busy and it was packed so I understand. The decor was very simple and minimal.\n\nWhen my friend had told me it was Michelin star rated I wasn't sure how I felt but after trying the food, it definitely proved me wrong. The quality of the ingredients was amazing. As mentioned earlier, it's one of the best ramen that I've ever had. I was craving for more the next day because it was so good. We had met some tourists in line and they told us it was their second time going during their trip in SF. That speaks volume.\n\nHighly suggest trying this place and try to come as early as possible to wait in line. There was already a line at 4PM and they don't open until 5PM.

Of course, all of us in line have been waiting and waiting, so we all make a dash to the nearest ATM.

Ended up waiting 1 h 15 m, which is both far longer than we ever like to wait on a normal basis but also shorter than we expected for a clear and cold weekend evening. I was, however, already fairly hungry when we got in line, so waiting really kicked my hunger up even further, and I basically inhaled my food when I got in.

The portion size was actually larger than we expected, so we probably could have gone without them knowing we were ordering two bowls of ramen. \n\nThe tori paitan was deeeeelish, albeit heavy, since it's a 'creamy' ramen. The duck chashu was a nice change from the typical ramen we go out for, and the pork was unbelievably tender.\n\nThe spicy lamb was not too spicy in the heat sense, but rather overly spiced for my taste, which detracted significantly from my experience. The spices used were ones I've eaten before with no trouble, but usually far less in amounts, so I ended up with a severely sour stomach. Quality is still there, so my dislike of it is more a matter of preference - and the fact that I apparently have a slightly more sensitive stomach.\n\nOverall, quality and quantity is definitely more than a few notches above other ramen places I've eaten at in SF, and I would recommend going at least once to try it for yourself. Whether or not you end up going back to wait in that line subsequent times is really up to how amazing you think the ramen is.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-18"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Spicy Tori Paitan and tasted the base soup before mixing in the red peppers and miso that make this the spicy version.

"], "author": "Yong P.", "review": "Some context, I'm a foodie from LA visiting SF over winter vacation. Mensho Tokyo was one of my top restaurants to check out after reading a yelp review ranking this place over other LA places this particular yelper had tried. I've scoured the LA ramen scene and rank Tsujita Annex above all else, which is the bar to which all other ramens are judged for me.\n\nBroth: To me, broth in ramen is most important followed by the noodles. I ordered the Spicy Tori Paitan and tasted the base soup before mixing in the red peppers and miso that make this the spicy version. The base soup was thick, creamy, and frothy but paradoxically tasted both rich and bland (flavors didn't pop) at same time. Something was missing. After mixing in spices the soup started to taste like Korean doenjang jjigae, which was kinda weird because I've never had doenjang jjigae with noodles.\n\nCompared to Tsujita Annex's broth which I just want to keep drinking against my better judgment (i.e., heart attack), the broth at Mensho lost my interest after a few spoonfuls.\n\nAlso, the thickness of broth made all the other ingredients sink into it, which made my bowl of ramen looked like a primordial soup halfway through.\n\nOverall, although the broth had layers of different flavors, but it didn't grab me. Perhaps I just didn't get the complexity. I had high expectations coming in given all the signage of its unique umami flavor and special nori that they use. IMO, the soup lacked  that \"yummy\" quality that makes my mouth water, which happens when I just think about the broth from Tsujita Annex or other places like Hakata Ikkousha or even the humble Santouka in Mitsuwa food court.\n\nNoodles: Thick, chewy, bouncy, nice texture and cooked a bit al dente. The noodles in themselves were great, and on par with Tsujita Annex.  Broth clung to the noodles well, however because I wasn't that big a fan of the broth, I didn't feel a desire to finish the noodles.\n\nChashu: I ordered single portion and didn't get to try the duck chashu. The pork chashu was mediocre and served thin, lukewarm, and on lean side compared to other places. It was tender but did not melt in my mouth.\n\nExtras: Surprisingly, my favorite part of the bowl was the bamboo shoots. They were flavored very well and had a nice crunch to them.\n\nVenue: Venue is small with about four communal tables and a few seats at bar facing kitchen. I came alone and had fun watching the chefs do their magic.\n\nWait: It is what it is. There wasn't a sign in sheet which required everyone to stay in line. I waited 35 minutes at around 9pm Friday, but if longer, it would be great to have option of putting name down and wander streets a bit to pass time. \n\nService: Given how busy they are, it is understandable that waiting staff are inattentive, but they were also not very cordial. Back in my hometown of Torrance, I'm used to mom and pop japanese places where there is a loud greeting and farewell regardless of how busy the place is. At Mensho, the waitress didn't give any acknowledgement (verbal or nonverbal) after I thanked her for the meal as I walked out. Not a big deal but I left with an unwelcome feeling. Also worth noting is that they included a service charge to bill. Total came out to $22 for one bowl of ramen (ouch). I've had really really good service at other busy SF eateries so my experience here may not just be a stranger effect (\"people are strange when you're a stranger\").\n\nAtmosphere: Decor is a bit generic and did not feel like a Japanese place in a traditional sense.

A two-plus-hour wait for an $18 bowl of ramen sounds like a Louis C.K. joke about San Francisco millennials with no punchline. I got exhausted thinking about the hoops I'd have to jump through to get a taste of the broth here. However, now that at least six weeks have elapsed since the grand opening in February, I had an opening that I couldn't bypass, the Thursday before Good Friday when I got off work early.\n\nEveryone says to be there at 4PM even though they don't open until an hour later, and so I did. If you don't count the screeching homeless woman who kept sauntering by, no one else showed up until around 4:35PM. That's not to say the staff was indifferent to my presence as they thanked me for coming and waiting patiently. Eventually a line did start to form and rather quickly. I got seated at the front counter promptly at 5PM where I had a nice view of the kitchen where activity was bustling behind he coffee beakers with the broth at full boil and the pork and duck chashu being meticulously sliced. I was sitting with a Filipino family who could barely contain their enthusiasm over the forthcoming noodlefest.\n\nI was feeling the same way and knew what to order since I had well over an hour to decide. I started with their one and only appetizer, the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. There were four of them completely shelled and marinated (photo: http://bit.ly/1Vp0sEV). Tasty freshness gone too soon, but the main event was about to occur. It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls. I was timid and just had a $4.75 bottle of Sapporo Premium to wash it all down (photo: http://bit.ly/1RTN9dq), but they have pricier Japanese artisan beers which they strongly recommended to me for the next time.

Here is my attempt to be objective. I ordered the Tori Paitan ramen with double chasu, an egg, and fried garlic aka full AF. \n\nBroth: This broth is THICK. First impression when sipping it was that it was very rich and almost even gritty since it was so thick. I warmed up to it after several bites and having it together with the noodles and the other ingredients. At the end, it made me feel pretty gross though. \n\nNoodles: Springy, my favorite type. \n\nChasu: Two types of chasu, pork and duck, both thinly sliced, both had great flavor. \n\nEgg: Shoyu egg, flavorful where you can actually taste the soy sauce marinade. Perfectly soft-boiled\n\nOther: Bamboo shoots tasted a bit more fermented than what I was used to but still good. The fried onions, kale, and cabbage were good additions as it added different complimenting textures and flavors to the dish. Fried garlic was a waste of an add for 2 dollars more as I felt it didn't add that much to the dish. \n\nWait time: 10 minutes; Came 10 minutes before opening on a Tuesday and there was already a small line in front but was able to get in with the first wave of people. \n\nService: Waitresses were friendly and knowledgeable about the ramen. Had sound suggestions regarding which egg to get (miso or shoyu), which ramen to try as a first timer, and what I should try in the future. \n\nPrice: Steep for ramen. Ingredients seem high quality and the place is pretty hyped up so I guess its understandable. \n\nOverall, the Tori Paiten ramen was good but may be too rich and thick for my taste.

The duck chasu and pork chasu was tender, perfectly cooked, and enhanced the broth (wishing there were doubles of each!). Even the kale was an unusual, but nice addition. The broth was perfect, not salty or oily. And the noodles were chewy! At first, it doesn't look like there's a lot of noodles, but the bowl is shaped quite deeply at the bottom, so all the noodles are hidden there. There was so much I liked about this ramen. \n\nI couldn't figure out what the seasonings on the table were, though there was pink himalayan salt, and maybe some other seasonings to personally enhance the broth to the right taste.

Even then, we waited for at least another hour and 15 minutes until we were finally seated.

The restaurant is quite small and there's two rows of tables. The front row was one long table and the back row near the windows was sectioned off into two separate tables. It's communal seating so you may be sitting with other parties if you are a small group.

The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of).

The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast.

And I actually really like the small space haha, reminds me of a lot of shops I've been in throughout Asia.\n\nSince I had just burned through my wallet on drinks, I opted for the lower priced Shio Ramen w/ Chasiu ($9 something, ~$11 w/ tip and tax). Food came out surprisingly fast. I was kinda sad that there wasn't much in my bowl. Everything was delicious but I want a lot more for the price! Everything definitely tasted top quality but when you only get one piece of meat, it kinda has you scratching your head. Broth was great. Looks like I should have gotten the Tori Paitan since everyone on here is raving about that one's broth.\n\nI'll stick to my cheap, hefty ramen shops for now.

I arrived about 30 minutes early and was able to get in after about 50 minutes of waiting (including the early half hour). The shop itself is very small and has very few seats. The seats that are there are honestly very uncomfortable. The tables are communal style and since they're high chairs I kept feeling like I was going to fall off and knock someone over. However, the product may be worth at least some of the suffering. This soup is so delicious, I can't believe they didn't just dump cream into it. I do find it a bit salty but I usually do. The noodles had a great bite to them as well. The chashu was good and bad. The fatty portions were tender and delicious but the rest was just average. Overall a delicious bowl of ramen but wish there were more items to help lighten it a bit.\n\nI also ordered the oysters appetizer. I'm going to be frank. I did not enjoy these at all. I didn't quite know what to expect. It seems to be cured in shoyu so it has almost a liver/kidney like texture but much saltier.

The chashu was the star of the dish. Just the perfect amount of fat and cooked to perfection, so soft and tender. It literally melted in my mouth so fast I was regretting not ordering extra. The duck was also delicious, very tender and comes medium rare, that beautiful pink. It comes with some bonito flakes and cabbage. On the table they have some dried plum salt and bonito powder to complement your ramen. \n\nHowever, to make this bowl of ramen complete, it's missing the marinated soft boiled egg.\n\nThis is one place I would highly recommend everyone lining up for and trying at least once.

Mostly pairs of people. We got to the front of the line and there's a menu on a podium. There was a note that this is a \"Gratuity Free\" restaurant - a flat rate of 15% is added to all diners check. This was a little off putting at first but I came to agree with the flat rate percentage. I'll make more comments further below to support my decision.\n\nAmbiance and seating:\n\nGreat ambiance. They have three main tables: the largest seating 10-12 individuals and the other two tables seat 6 people each. The tables are elevated and have barstool seats. The tables are interesting in a sense that there's a gap built into the table, large enough to slide a thin-ish purse (anything wider than 3 inches might not fit) or a wallet and phone into the space if you don't want to put your purse on the floor. There is a coat hook by the door (I believe another person posted a photo of this). My friend and I were seated across from each over and next to us was another pair. Seating is a shared experience - most people seem to be seated across from their partner with exception of one pair that sat side to side. The fact that they only have three tables sort of suggests this. The ambiance is very welcoming, bright, and clean. Lots of chatter and you may need to raise your voice a little bit to hear your friend/SO, but definitely nice. Music in the background seemed pretty varied. It wasn't stuck on a specific radio with one type of music. There was also a TV mounted above the rest room, but it was playing on mute and no captions. It appeared to be on a loop and I believe it was more of an infomercial for the restaurant (?) - unclear.\n\nThe FOOD:\n\nFriend and I ordered the same thing: the Tori Paitan Ramen with a soy sauce egg (+$1.80/each). Menu doesn't offer that ramen as spicy but you can request Habanero (+$2/each) to spice it up - it came out in a slightly chopped/pulverized paste; makes it easier to mix into the broth in my opinion. We also ordered fried garlic (+$2) which came out in a diced form (see photo). I tried the broth first and it was sooooo delicious!! It had a milkier consistency than what I've had at other ramen places but the balance was great. It wasn't too salty nor under seasoned but just right. The chasiu was SO perfect - cooked to the point where it's falling apart when you try to bite down. I LOVED the texture and al dente-ness of the ramen. I personally prefer ramen noodles (and wonton noodles) with more of a resistance when I bite into it. I hate it when noodles are cooked to the point that they're falling apart when I pick them up with chop sticks. I cannot rave enough about their noodles!!! There were a few leaves of kale, some cabbage, bamboo shoots, and some fried/baked veg that I can't put my finger on that was also in the broth.I recognize the fried/baked beg but can't remember the name. At some point, friend and I weren't talking. We were slurping and eating intensely.\n\nThe drink menu consisted mostly of Asian (?) beers, sake, and soju. I don't believe any sodas were on the menu. Water is always an option \n\nThe SERVICE:\n\nGreat! There were three ladies taking orders,serving, and clearing tables. All of them were efficient and unobtrusive. Sometimes I feel very rushed or I'm waiting a long time to place my order but here, it felt like when I glanced around, one of the ladies immediately sensed my eyes and came right over. Everyone had a smile and was offering refills at a good rate. Food came out about 10 mins after ordering and when we were slowing down and coming to the end of our meal, I didn't feel pressured to hurry up, pay, and get out. We slowly savored the broth and when WE were done, someone came up and asked if they could take away our bowls - definitely appreciate the attention the servers give. Not too much but enough to know they're there. \n\nAll in all I would DEFINITELY come here again...I'll keep my fingers crossed that there won't be a hella long line.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-09-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I tried the organic shoyu, spicy lamb, and tori paitan broths and the flavors are all super strong (bordering on too salty) ", "but they're just sooo thick and heavy.

I think it was hard to notice the chashu in the tori paitan, due to the decadence of the soup, but in the shoyu, the chashu is a fatty standout. probably the best chashu in a ramen that i've had. the noodles in the shoyu are good, but different - thinner and lighter than it's tori paitan counterpart. it paired well w/ the shoyu broth. The broth itself tasted like bonito more than shoyu. \n\n\nI would not come back for these two ramen dishes, but I still want to come back to try the other options. As for the wait, we waited about 30 minutes the first time, and maybe 20 minutes the second time. Not bad at all. Once you're in, though, the seats and ambiance are not intended to have patrons stay and shoot the shit.

As such, what better way to get back into than start with the absolutely most mindblowing culinary experience I've had locally in years? That's right, this humble little ramen shop in the Tenderloin was exactly that.\n\nI'd been hearing about this shop for a while since it opened to great fanfare and long lines. Many of my friends went on at least a weekly basis. Since I don't live in SF, it's never been very convenient for me to go there. One time I was in SF for a Johnnie Walker event, and my friends and I thought it would be an awesome idea to check out Mensho afterwards. It was around 8:30 or 9 pm and we were starving and needed something to soak up the alcohol. We got to Mensho, but the line was ridiculously long, and starving stomachs couldn't wait. Mensho would have to wait for another day.\n\nFast forward a few months, and finally, I heard lines were starting to become more manageable. I was in SF to meet a few visitors from the mid-West, and my friends and I suggested that we check out Mensho. Again, it was around 8:30 pm. We walked over from Union Square, and there was a line, but it looked bearable. We had 6 people. Maybe waited 20 min in line, not bad at all given how small the shop is and how big our group was.

I hadn't had broth like this in a long time, and it's been a long time since I last went to Ramen Dojo, so I can't really compare except that I recall having a similar reaction. I don't even know how to describe the rich creamy flavor (but not disgustingly fatty like Orenchi), except that perhaps this is what they invented the word \"umami\" for.\n\nThe hype was not blown out of proportion. It really is as amazing as everyone hyped it up to me. Normally, I try to temper hype and go somewhere with low expectations for fear of ruining the experience.

The staff is super friendly and once youre inside, service is fast.\n\nI got recommended the Tori Paitan, which is their rich & creamy chicken soup.  I enjoyed all of the meats included, especially the chashu.  I read the ingredients but had no idea that \"menma\" was bamboo.  Now I dont necessarily hate bamboo, I'd just rather not eat it.  I would describe to you what I think bamboo tastes like, but it might spoil your appetite.  This broth has an extremely strong bamboo flavor. I wish I had ordered the shoyu instead, so next time I'll do just that.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-03-01"}, {"excerpts": ["So here are the bowls of ramen we tried: \n\n(1) Tori Paitan: I think this is their specialty.

You want a tip on when to come? Probably even at weird times, the line is better but it's still long. We came on a Thursday night around 9:15p. Maybe it was because of the NBA finals, with a game that just recently ended and people still at the bar, or maybe it was just because we caught the lull in between the dinner rush and the late dinner crowd. We ended up waiting for about 20 minutes. I would also recommend you come in a smaller group of like 2 people. You are likely to get seated faster with a small party because the shop is very small. Bigger parties just have to wait for more tables to open up. \n\nOk, on to the ramen. You want to know if it's worth the wait? I don't think any food is really worth a two-hour wait, so that's where I'm coming from. But it is very good ramen. We got three bowls to share between the two of us so that we could try more things.  My friend who had been there before said that her favorite is vegan tantanmen, and we are both partial to spicy ramen. However, they ran out by the time we got there. At least that's what our server said - but I think she must have gotten false information from the kitchen.  The dude next to us who came after got a bowl, which made us very sad. Note that if you get more food than you can eat, they do NOT do to-go orders. Meaning they won't give you a to-go box. I'm not sure I like this policy. You shouldn't make delicious food and then not let people bring it home with them to enjoy if they can't finish it all. I will also say that I still like Ramen Dojo better than this place because I'm partial to spicy broth and they didn't have the spicy one when we were here. \n\nSo here are the bowls of ramen we tried: \n\n(1) Tori Paitan: I think this is their specialty. I don't really like chicken broth ramen, but this place has the best chicken ramen I've ever had. The broth is frothy and creamy and satisfying. Also the noodles here are some of the best ramen noodles I've ever had. They're thicker than normal and really yummy. Still, I love spicy ramen and this was delicious but a little too bland for me. The toppings are good too - duck chashu and pork chashu are both yummy. \n\n(2) Shoyu: If you like shoyu ramen, this is probably the best one I've ever had. If you like lighter broths this is the one for you. I'm not as big a fan of lighter broths, but I could tell this ramen was done really well. The noodles are really good in this one too, still chewy but a little thinner than the ones that come in the tori paitan. \n\n(3) Spicy Mazesoba: Originally, we were going to get the vegan tantanmen as our third bowl but they ran out. Then we wanted to get the tsukemen, but they said they run out at 7p. So we decided on the spicy mazesoba. I have never had this before, so I had no idea what it is. Basically, it's like noodles with sauce but no soup. It comes in a bowl (see attached pic) with an egg yolk and various toppings. Note that the spicy one also comes with a side of what I think are habanero peppers, but not super sure. We thought these were carrots and put the entire thing in - it was wayyyyy too spicy this way - like wasabi style spicy. Do not do what we did! I think this noodle dish would have been really yummy to try and share if we didn't accidentally make it so darn spicy, it came with thick and chewy delicious noodles. Good alternative to the soup ramens, and interesting to try if you come with a group. \n\nAll in all, I'd give this place five stars for the food. But docking it one star because of the to-go policy and because they didn't explain how to eat the mazesoba to us. It's not really intuitive! Just don't go in expecting great service either because it's a little too crowded and busy to give great service. \n\nI will definitely be back to try to get my hands on bowls of tsukemen and the vegan tantanmen!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the single Tori Paitan which it seems this place is known for.

I sat at the table closest to the bar and I kept getting bumped into by people walking toward or serving the people at the bar.

We got in line around 4:30 PM on Sunday evening and it was already pretty long. It started raining a bit while we were in line and by the time we were inside, it was POURING. But the line was just as long at 8 PM as it was at 4:30.\n\n+ DECOR/AMBIANCE\nThe decor is very interesting and trendy. It's a hip, modern spin on a Japanese restaurant -- tons of writing on the walls, which are very fun to read! It explains what ramen is, what umami is, etc. There's a coat rack towards the front. It's very cozy and homey feeling. The restaurant itself is INSANELY small. There's three longish communal tables, and the restaurant can probably seat about 25-30 people. You will be in close quarters with everyone sitting around you. However, it's easy to ignore the conversations next to you because it is CRAZY LOUD. It was so hard to hear anything my friend said and he was sitting right across from me. It was even harder to hear/comprehend the waitresses since they all seemed to talk very quietly and softly. They play some loud pop music in the back and with the constant yelling from people trying to hear each other, I definitely wouldn't describe it as a calming atmosphere LOL. Probably not good for a date. Good for friends and small groups. \n\n+ SERVICE\nWell aside from the insanely long line, our waitresses were very attentive. There were a lot of them too. They were all girls that spoke very quietly so it made it hard to hear/understand what they were saying. I wanted to order the Tori Paitan with double cha siu but I guess our waitress was confused as to how I could eat so much because she tried to clarify the difference between the regular and the double and I kept saying I wanted the double but she was very confused. I eventually was just like yes I want the regular DOUBLE cha siu not DOUBLE DOUBLE, but the $18 one. I ended up with the normal Tori Paitain, $16 one not the $18. Sad. But oh well. They also didn't seem to know the items on the menu that well. The group next to us would ask which ramen was which once she brought it out to the table, and she'd have to run back and ask. I ordered the Tori Paitan and my friend ordered the Shoyu, and they swapped it accidentally. This made me very sad. LOL. But I will say they were very nice and apologetic about it. They randomly gave us green tea LOL. We didn't ask for it but they were just like HERE TAKE THIS TEA, so we did and we were very grateful LOL. \n\n+ THE RAMEN\nSO FREAKING GOOD. YUM. As I said, I had the Tori Paitan. It was a great portion size. They did not skimp on the noodles, which I appreciated. Sadly I did not get to eat the ramen how I usually do since they gave my friend my ramen at first and when we realized, it was already all stirred up. I like to leave it as is and eat all the vegetables first, and then eat the noodles and meat without like...disturbing the presentation of any of it LOL if that makes sense. I'm weird I know. I just like my food to look nice while I eat it. I didn't get the double cha siu like I wanted but the meat was very delicious and flavorful. Perfectly cooked, and just melted in your mouth. The vegetables were also SO GOOD. Strangely, to me it tasted very meaty. And it seemed to melt in your mouth also. The Tori Paitain comes with a thicker noodle than the Shoyu, which I loved since I'm all for the fat noodles. The broth was VERY thick, and sort of gritty...not in a bad way. It was creamy and very flavorful. It's not for the faint of heart. I tried some of the Shoyu broth, and it's noticeably lighter. Very salty. I definitely preferred the Tori Paitan more. \n\nOverall, delicious ramen. VERY LONG WAIT. Maybe the wait will die down in a few months. And by then, hopefully the service will be better. I think they just needed to work on speaking more clearly, and knowing the orders better. Obviously this place just opened recently, so I'll let the slightly less than satisfactory service slide for now. The waitresses were all very nice and the complimentary tea was a nice gesture.

It's apparently a recent food trend in Japan, so Mensho Tokyo might currently be one of the only places to offer this dish in the United States.

It's essentially a dry bowl of noodles (not quite soba though, a bit thicker and similar in consistency to their ramen) with some vegetable (green onions, chives, watercress, seaweed, garlic, etc.) and meat toppings (ground pork)--somewhat of a cross between bibimbap (it has the raw egg too) and zha jiang mian.  \n\nMixing it all together is when the magic happens.  Every bite of noodles was accompanied with a saucy mixture of meat, fragant herbs, and crunch from the vegetables.  Why hasn't anyone thought about doing this before?  It's worth mentioning that we got the extra spicy version, and it certainly did pack quite a kick!\n\nThe wait on a random Tuesday night was about 2 hours, and when we finished eating at 9ish, the line was still just as long!

Because it was freaking tasty and the ingredients are fantastic. The ramen goes for $16 which is on the higher end but the ingredients are high quality so you get what you pay for. For those people who gripe over the price probably are those who like bang for buck over quality...not my type of food philosophy. If you want the best ramen in SF and willing to pay on the higher side for it then this is your place. The lines will be long because everyone else wants in on this greatness.

Since that day it's been really clear that the inhabitants of San Francisco are suffering from a severe ramen shortage because the lines to eat at this tiny place haven't let up.

I have never had duck chashu before, but it was very tender and succulent and did not taste fatty or oily compared to Chinese roast duck.  The accoutrements with the food were pretty decent with the bamboo shoots, bonito flakes, etc.  The burdock root was a nice surprise with the katsuobushi sauce as it made it taste like there was bacon in the dish almost (or like bacon + brussel sprouts taste).  In terms of the noodles themselves, they were not as firm/springy as I would have liked, and it seemed as though I got all really short/cut up noodles and not the long strands of noodles where you can \"slurp\" the noodles as a sign of respect that you like the dish.  This could have just been my particular bowl as I noticed others in my party had longer noodles.\n\nOverall, worth a try, I probably wouldn't wait another hour for the bowl if I was really craving ramen as there are other places to get my ramen fix, but a solid choice/restaurant to visit.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["The broth of the tori paitan was creamy AF.

I did notice that they do not offer an egg, which is interesting.\n\nI'm starting to think that Tsukemen noodles tend to be the chewiest because they are not cooked in soup.  Next time, I would get the Tsukemen.  The problem is that they only have a certain number of bowls.  \n\nOverall, it wasn't worth the 1.5 hour wait in my opinion.

I have to be honest, I really enjoyed the broth. It was unique, savory, and really really hit the spot. \n\nNOODLES: The Ume broth and Tori Paitan broths were delicious, but the noodles themselves were different from what I was used to (not bad, just not what I was expecting from a bowl of ramen).\n\nPRICE: I would've given this place maybe 4/5... Unfortunately, I think the priciness of each bowl kind of put me off. It was about $16-18 per bowl, and the bowls weren't particularly large nor did it come with a lot of toppings. That was disappointing. I just can't justify paying that much for ramen, when I've had ramen that has tasted just as great (or even better) over in San Mateo for less. \n\nSERVICE: Because of the table arrangement, it was really difficult for the servers to get around us without reaching around / over you which was kind of uncomfortable. We also felt super rushed - they asked us MULTIPLE times whether we were done (and we're not even slow eaters), and tried to bus our bowls away on several occasions while we were still working on drinking the broth. I used to be a waitress, so I understand the importance of turning over tables, but definitely not at the expense of your customers' dining experience.\n\nAll in all, would I come back?

It was a surprising burst of flavour, sweet and salty, with a slight tang of nut and acidity. \n\nThe tori paitan with double chasu came in the perfect size, with the right soup to noodle ratio; however, the ratio of toppings to the noodle+ soup was underwhelming and disappointing.

It is true that the broth is slightly grainier towards the bottom of the bowl.  \n\nThe strangest thing was that everything in the bowl was fairly lukewarm which was alarming when I first tried it, however the noodles were steaming hot in contrast! Once you mix the bowl up, the broth becomes steamier and the temperature is more balanced out. Unfortunately the meat is still not hot, something I prefer my meat to be in all of my ramens. The duck was the winner compared to the pork chasu, which I've had better pork chasu's at Parlor or other places. I tried the broth of the soyu ramen which was delicious, just a tad bit too salty. The noodles for the paitain were thick and Al Dente, for the shoyu they were flatter but still consistent in springiness and chewiness.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food here. You can tell that it's high quality, and made with a lot of thought and love. I would come here after the chef arrives back from Japan and the other dishes are in stock--very eager to try the tonkotsu and the umi miso ramen (miso ramen is my favourite!! Go to Ramen Parlor for a bomb miso ramen). There are also tsukemen ramen and soba that are in the works.

Let me explain - I grew up in restaurants, worked in both small & large-scale operations, lived in Japan & LOVE ramen.  Please pardon the long review as I'm about to share...\n\nWAIT - I get it's the long anticipated grand opening, and over SB50 weekend no less but you should know there's such thing as a soft opening to work out all the kinks before your highly-anticipated US debut.  Never mind the 3hr+ wait, train your staff to know the mechanics of seating & managing a hungry mob outside.  I came by myself & waited in line patiently before the door opened but noticed how they failed to move the line (you see a LOT when you had to go thru a long wait like mine).  There were plenty of single seats available throughout the evening but they never seated solo diners to ease the line...guess they wanted to be fair to others who waited (which I get) but this only added to the angry crowd.  Either 1) designate a few chairs for solo diners to ease the line or 2) insert them where there's already a single diner seating across from an EMPTY chair or 3) seat them where there's a party of 3 or 5.  This is a ramen joint not a fancy sit-down, so operate like one...in, out & no one gets hurt!\n\nMENU - Once inside, waited yet again patiently for a menu, any menu...at this point, I was weak from enduring the cold and just sat in silence getting warm-up but quickly found out how hectic the place was w/ no server in sight, so as soon as a waitress showed up I had to flag her down for a menu.  What amazed me was the moment she handed me the menu, she asked whether I was ready to order!  I told her you just gave me the menu so please give me a sec, so she stood there expecting for an order, instantly.  Menu was limited during grand opening, no Mensho \"welcome ramen\", no chicken karaage, etc...just ramen for now.\n\nFOOD - I'm a Tonkatsu Ramen lover, was shocked to see there's none offered out of the 7 types of ramen on the menu.  I ordered the $18 Tori Paitan Chashu Ramen, got served w/o too long of a wait (yay but $18??!!).  But wait...my spoon was missing from my setting...BIG no-no!

Finally, I just dived in, too hungry to wait around for a silly spoon while my ramen's getting cold (another no-no)...who cares if I had to hold the bowl up like I was in Japan just to taste that rich, creamy broth full of yummy umami.  \n\nForget the traditional toppings of a sexy ramen 1/2 egg, nori, menma (bamboo shoot) etc...you get fried gobo (burdock root), a few chives mixed in, an odd curly leaf of kale which haunts me like an unnecessary garnish of a curly parsley in any bad dishes I've seen (let alone in a Mensho ramen).  The broth tasted incredible and lived up to the Mensho name.  I can just see how much time & effort that went into it, but the noodles was just too thick for the already thick broth.  I couldn't help but envy others who had a different flat noodle in their ramen.  Guess I'll have to come back when their ramen machine is up & running to taste it again, but for now the thick noodles just don't really belong in that rich broth...I can see it being an incredible ramen dish served cold as the noodles were perfectly chewy & got a great bite!  \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE - I was so hungry, I finished my bowl under 10min vs. my 3hr+ wait outside but at least tummy got fed.  Waited patiently for my check which never came since my waitress whom I finally had to flag down for a check said they had lost my check after some investigating.  She later came back w/ a manual check but never came back to gather my cc.  I sat & observed how hectic the place was still at 9:40pm and realized how green the staff must had been w/o much training as to offer proper customer service.  Finally, I had to flag down another waitress who was nice enough to run back w/ my cc.\n\nOVERALL - 3.5 stars and will wait for them to work out the kinks & all the hype before returning.  Lots of ideas for improvement.  It will be interesting to see if anything improved then.  I really wanted to try another bowl of ramen (that tells you how much I wanted to like Mensho) but didn't want to wait & go home at midnight due to the sheer chaos.\n\nP.S. our table (long table closet to kitchen against the wall) kept collapsing a bit on us any time someone puts their elbow down.

The soup was a great change of pace from the same old tepid, weak tonkotsu broth with curly pre-frozen noodles that you can get elsewhere in the area. The chashu was generous and delicious: a soft and fatty round of simmered pork, with two juicy slices of duck meat on the side. The tori paitan is thick and rich, for those of you who like a ramen with more body, and the noodles are appropriately matched. Agreed with others that the sprig of kale isn't much to my liking, and I miss having some of my Japanese ramen favorites (menma is a big one for me), but the fried gobo is excellent and adds a flavor that a lot of Americans aren't familiar with. The shio ramen at $9 is the single best value bowl of ramen I've had in the US: the shoyu just edges it out, but for those looking for something delicious that won't weigh you down, it's a proper shio ramen with a strong chicken flavor. The garlic tends to settle on the bottom, which leads to an interesting shift in flavor as you make your way through the bowl and the garlic sits longer in the remaining soup.\n\nThis feels like a shop transplanted from Tokyo (which it is), and beats out every one of the other 36 ramen shops I've tried across the US to take the title of #1. It competes handily with the best shops in Tokyo as well. The interior is beautifully appointed, clean, and modern, and I love that they've turned the entire restaurant into counter seating (albeit with the concession of counter-height tables for groups) for a more Japanese dining experience.\n\nThey're not launching with everything on the menu, and they're waiting on the go-ahead from the health department before they can start making their own noodles with the machine that they imported from Japan, but Mensho Tokyo is already far and away better than anything else available in the area. Can't wait until they finish sourcing ingredients and start serving additional items from the menu! When that happens, we'll finally be able to have proper tsukemen in the Bay Area.

One sip of the broth and we both swooned. The Paitan broth is incredibly savory and creamy, the texture like a mix of soup and gravy. The Ramen comes with both duck and pork chashu (1 slice of each in the regular Ramen and two slices of each in the double). The duck chashu was an interesting addition. As my friend commented, you could definitely taste the lemon. To me, it felt a little out of place in the creamy broth, but whatever floats your boat. The PORK chashu though. Omigod. I'm already a sucker for pork, so this absolutely stole my heart. \n\nAbout a third of the way through the meal, however, I could definitely feel some regret.

We decided to wait despite the fact that they had run out of the noodles for the Shio and Shoyu ramen. I even went across the street to get Hot Cheetos because I was so hungry. We entered the restaurant around 5:50 or so and sat at the \"bar\" which is really just 4 chairs looking into the kitchen. Given that our only options were the Tori Paitan, which is written about very favorably here, and the vegan ramen due to the limited menu during Mensho's early operations, we both went with the Paitan.\n\nWhen the reviews say the Paitan is really creamy, they mean it. It is almost too overwhelming with meat flavor and we could not even finish our whole bowl because we got a bit grossed out. It was just a lot of the same flavor. If you've never had Paitan, think Tonkotsu, but WAY creamier. \n\nI could tell that the ramen was really high quality, which is why I am giving 4 stars and perhaps if I would've tried the Shoyu or Shio, I would give 5 stars. I've had ramen at the best places in New York (Ippudo, Totto) so I have some idea of what good ramen should taste like. There's just no way I see myself waiting that long again for ramen, especially in San Francisco, where there must be a dozen places to get at least a decent bowl without the hassle of waiting. \n\nFor Mensho: You guys need to start recording people's cell phone numbers and texting them when their table is ready. There are two bars across the street I would have much rather sat at for 90 minutes. Also, the servers seemed confused about which seats they were covering, as I ordered with 3 different servers. I'm sure this kink will be worked out as the weeks go by, however. \n\nTL;DR - if the wait is over 1 hour, go somewhere else, especially in the first few months of the restaurant being open.

There aren't any individual tables, rather, you'll end up at a communal table that seats about 6 guests. I noticed that most people kept to themselves/the people they came with - but some people (generally the individual diners) would have a great conversation with the complete strangers that they sat next to.

They provide a little basket under each pair of seats, meant for putting any belongings (bags/jackets etc) during your dining experience.

I expect the wait for Fridays and weekends to be much longer, but I swear it is worth it. \n\nInside: Mensho is a super small ramen shop, with a simple, clean cut themed interior design. Everything looked super clean and new. All white everything. \n\nStaff: Service was not extraordinary, but its more or less like a service you get at most authentic asian restaurants. The staff's priority is to get the line rolling but rotating people in an out as fast as possible. \n\nThe Ramen: WAS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING.\n\n I ordered the Tori Paitan, which was $16, a bit on the pricey end that I am used to paying for ramen. As soon as I took a sip of the broth, I couldn't help but smile. I was absolutely stunned by the richness and intense flavor of the ramen. \n\nIt came with 2 small slivers of duck chashu and 1 ginormous sliver of pork chashu. The duck chashu was seasoned perfectly and tasted unique but delicious. The pork chashu was a bit fatty, but still flavorful. There was also a small bushel of kale and bamboo shoots. The noodles were thicker than most ramen shops I have been too (which I personally prefer) and had a little bounce to them. It was the perfect combination of chewiness and tenderness- perfect for slurping. Best of all was the broth- it was creamy, rich but not too heavy, and EXTREMELY flavorful. It tasted as if a chicken was used to make the first batch of broth, which was then boiled again with a fresh new chicken, but 10 times. Everything in the bowl came together perfectly. Although the portions may seem a bit small, the richness of the broth will make up for it. By the time I finished 3/4 of the ramen, the broth was getting a little bit overwhelming, but nevertheless I could not stop until I finished every last noodle in the bowl. So if you are worried that this bowl of ramen won't fill you, I promise that you will be A-OK. \n\nIf you are looking to get your mind blown by a bowl of ramen, Mensho is the closest you will get to authentic Japanese ramen in the city.\n\nJUST DO IT.

Or rather, step forward imperceptibly slowly along a somewhat gritty stretch of Geary. I couldn't get Google Maps Popular Times to work for this place - probably because it's so new - but my suspicion is the chart would be solid blue lines i.e. constantly busy. Fortunately my friend lives right across the street and has been carefully monitoring the line on an almost constant basis. She should really set up a pay-per-view MenshoCam (TM) that integrates seamlessly with the Eater app. That'd help fund the $18 ramen addiction.\n\nUtilizing our insider knowledge of line dynamics we seized our opportunity and the wait - thankfully - was only around 35-40 minutes. The weather wasn't terrible and we even made new acquaintances and exchanged ramen recos as we inched toward our supper. The space itself is tiny yet minimalist chic and, given the hype combined with limited capacity, it's easy to understand the long lines. The confusing thing was that the menu written on the wall doesn't correspond to what they actually sell so best not to pay attention to that.\n\nMy go-to in most noodle shops is the Tonkotsu Ramen which unfortunately Mensho doesn't yet offer, apparently they're still in the process of setting up the necessary equipment. Instead I went with the Tori Paitan, a recommendation from our line buddy, which was decent but not really my cup of soup. I kind of regretted not going with the Shoyu Ramen.\n\nOverall I liked the experience and didn't so much mind the wait but can only really give 3 stars based on the food, which admittedly was largely down to my own rash selection. I'd like to come back and try the Shoyu Ramen, or ideally the Tonkotsu once they finally have that available, and will rate again. The only thing I would say is that there was no hot sauce or hot pepper available, and frankly I like a bit of heat in my ramen - I get that this is a purist type of place though. If you like that you might want to bring your own. Just saying.\n\nAs to whether it was worth the wait, I'd say yes in this case as a new experience but wouldn't want to wait close to 1 hour even once the menu is updated. I did try to come back a few weeks after my initial visit but the line was much longer than before so ended up elsewhere.

I didn't mind so it was not too much of an issue. I do wish that there were other seating options besides stools, especially after waiting outside for so long. It would have been nice to have some back support to make the dining experience more comfortable (though I do understand the stools for aesthetic purposes). There are also baskets under each table for you to store your things, which are convenient too. This location also has just one bathroom, which had an unusual odor to it, but since it's located so close to the dining and kitchen area, there was not an opportunity to properly air it out. Better ventilation in the dining room would have also been appreciated because the aroma of the rich flavored food was a bit intense at times. \n\nIf the hype ever dies down, I might come back here and try another noodle option, but based on my first experience I am in certainly no rush. I wish they took to-go orders (or at least a boxing option), but perhaps that's an area they can get into once their business starts to grow.

Two friends ordered the tori paitan, which is their richest, creamiest option. One friend ordered the vegan tantanmen, which I loved and attempted to switch with my own bowl of ramen. I ordered the organic shoyu ramen; it was slightly lighter but just as flavorful. They're all good; it just depends on personal preferences.\n\nThey currently don't serve eggs in their ramen.

I was totally pumped and ready to love it.\n\nTo start, I went there prepared to wait in line. Reviews advised that the wait would be around 30 minutes, ours was a bit closer to 40 but we did go around 7:00pm, prime dinner time, I guess! Fortunately the wait time gave us time to peruse the menu and decide what to order. I am thankful that the menu is not overwhelmingly long, but there were several interesting options so I had to choose carefully.\n\nOnce we got in, we could tell that the space is small, fitting maybe 20-25 people, which does explain the lineup. It has a nice cozy charm to it though, with a type of communal seating, and wall decor. Somehow it made the experience feel more authentic and worth the wait. This might not be ideal for some people looking for an intimate or private meal.\n\nWe decided to try the Enoki mushroom chips to start. I have absolutely zero regrets here- they were freakin' delicious! In fact, I would have been perfectly satisfied with a bowl of these for dinner! They're kind of like crispy onion strings you can get on burgers, same texture... but the flavour is just yummy. Disclaimer: I am a bit of a mushroom fanatic, so if you don't like mushrooms, these might not be for you.\n\nAfter much deliberation and recommendations from our server, I ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen (double chashu) which is what they are known for. I was given the heads up that this is not \"typical\" ramen as it has a creamier soup, but I thought I'd try it anyway. I'll start by saying- the pork and duck chashu were delicious. Super tender and packed full of flavour. I loved it. The noodles were also done well. Not too soft, but not too hard, just what I expected. Unfortunately that is where my enjoyment ends. \n\nI won't fault the restaurant for it, but apparently I am not much of a miso fan and maybe I'm just not that into ramen, even though I really wanted to be! I did enjoy the overall experience, and will say that even though there was a bit of a mishap with my soup- our server worked quickly with her manager to rectify the situation, which I always do appreciate.\n\nOverall- if you like ramen, definitely come check it out.

They were meaty and has such great umami flavors and super crunchy. Yummmm\n\nShoyu Oysters 0/5\nThis definitely was not for me and it's really an acquired taste. The oysters seem to be cured in the shoyu leaving it in a kind of pasty and chalky kind of texture.

Or maybe there was too much flavor everything was kind of fighting each other so it cancelled everything out, which made it just.. murky. The noodles had a good bite to it and the soup was able to hold on to the noodles. The chashu was good, the best thing about the bowl of noodles, it literally melts in your mouth.

Cold beer is a must, so I had to deduct a point there. \n\nAll in all, our bill plus the mandatory tips came out to be $68 which is ridiculous for two bowls of ramen with appetizers and a bottle of beer.

I, on the other hand, prefer a very thick broth (like tsukemen) to coat my noodles so this ramen aligns perfectly with my preferences. \nThe chashu has that sort of complex, dark meat flavor that I love about duck. The broth was thick and very chicken-y while the noodles were the perfect width for holding broth.

Most recently, I came because I had heard about their new matcha tori paitan ramen and wanted to give that a shot.\n\nI came right before they opened, around 4:45 on Wednesday, and there was only a handful of people in line. To be fair, it was a hot day--maybe 80 degrees--and only the most dedicated Mensho fans would even attempt ramen in that weather. The heat was definitely a barrier to enjoying the ramen; let's just say that I've been to Mensho many times but the lack of AC has never bothered me until this meal...\n\nBut was the matcha tori paitan worth it? YES it was! At $17 a bowl, it definitely doesn't come cheap, but I appreciated the subtle addition of the matcha to the already fabulous tori paitan ramen. Both my friend and I thought that the matcha flavor was very subtle and you had to stop and think about the flavors in your mouth to really taste it. Other than that, everything else about this dish is the same. The soup is still deliciously rich and creamy, the noodles thick and satisfying to chew, and the duck and pork chashu slices were perfectly tender. \n\nAlso, I want to call out that they offer soft boiled eggs now! Unfortunately it's not included in the base ramen, so you have to fork out another $1.80 to add it, but it is completely worth it. I'm just really grateful that they've started offering it here, since for the longest time they didn't. I've had a lot of good ramen eggs before, but even then I think the one at Mensho is one of my favorites. It comes as a whole egg instead of sliced in half, and when you bite into it, you can see the perfectly partially cooked egg yolk inside. Plus it's marinated perfectly and that first bite of the marinated egg white and half cooked york is really memorable.\n\nMy friend and I also shared the poke soba ($18) as we were intrigued by the 10 bowl limit per day, but I would recommend skipping this. Because it was called poke soba, I thought all the proteins in the dish would be seafood, but for some reason there was also chashu in there. It ended up being a weird combination of warm and cold ingredients (the soba was also warm). Also we underestimated how full we'd be from the ramen. By the time we both finished with our tori paitan and were ready to start on the poke soba, we were already feeling pretty stuffed...\n\nAnother friend ordered the vegan tantanmen as he is vegetarian, and he was blown away by how delicious and flavorful the ramen is.

Although I was skeptical about trying it, I now understand why this place is so popular.\n\nFood:\nI've tried the Tori Paitan Ramen and Spicy Lamb Ramen. The noodles are incredibly fresh and flavorful . The broth for the spicy lamb has a similarity with Indian curry. Another note is that the broth is very creamy and has amazing flavor! The spice level of the spicy lamb is very mild, so unless you have an extremely  low spice tolerance you'll love it.  I think I prefer the spicy lamb over the Tori Paitan but either one is a good choice! \n\nService:\nThe waitresses are great at answering your questions and giving recommendations. But for some reason once I got my ramen I was never checked on or asked for water refills until the end but it wasn't a big deal for me. Today I got a seat that has the view of the kitchen. While I was waiting for my order I was watching the cooks work and it was amazing to see how a Michelin-starred restaurant operates in the kitchen. The way that the team in the kitchen works together and perfectly times everything is just outstanding. \n\nWait times:\nThey open at 5pm so I suggest you get their at least a half hour before. For example I showed up at 4:25pm and was the fourth person in line. At 4:50pm there was about 20 people behind me. So, show up early to get into the first wave of seating. If you have a party, make sure everyone is there or else they won't seat you. But you can try your luck and ask the waitress if you can order for the people that aren't here yet. \n\nPrice:\nI paid somewhere between $19-$20 for Spicy Lamb Ramen. They already include 15% gratuity into your bill. This is very reasonable price for the quality that you get and the fact that it's a Michelin-starred restaurant.\n\nOverall this place is amazing!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-07-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Maybe I'll come back to try the tori paitan ramen ", "but it'll have to depend on the line which is pretty bad during prime dinner hours.

That said, the noodle quality here is probably the best I've had - great chewy texture and definitely handmade. \n\nThe broth is very rich, creamy, and thick - I prefer a lighter and more soupier broth. My fiance got the lamb ramen ($16) - explosion of flavor but also very salty and heavy. I tried the vegan ramen ($18) which was a little lighter but still pretty thick as far as ramen broths go. The flavors were nice - peanut/ nuts and soy mixed in with a little kick of heat. I liked the toppings - edamame, kale sprouts, green onion, and mushrooms. The added poached egg is a must - cooked perfectly. Definitely one of the better vegan ramen's I've had. \n\nThe space is pretty tight with communal tables and bench seating. The crowd usually lines up prior to opening at 5pm so get here early if you want to be part of the first wave.

Why not give out numbers? Customers literally cannot go do something else while waiting, and it's a big time waste. Why force wasting of (a LOT of people's) time? To prove what, exactly? I'm fine with waiting, but I'm not fine with a restaurant being so arrogant to force its customers to mandatorily wait in a line. The only reasons I can think of for this is: a) marketing - if there's a lot of people waiting, it must be good so let's convince even more people to waste their time to wait in line to eat at this place! and b) efficiency - if people are readily available, the restaurant can immediately seat people when a table clears out. Reason a is just selfish. Reason b can be solved by warning customers that if they're not there when they're called, they will be skipped over/crossed out. Or better yet, they can actually invest in a good technology system of calling/texting people. A bunch of restaurants have this, and I very much appreciate places that do. PLEASE change your must-wait-in-line policy. It's just selfish, arrogant, and wastes a LOT of people's time. Making people sign in on a sheet of paper or with one of the waiters/waitresses is fine; don't have to get all fancy with technology.

The restaurant is very small with bar top tables and not much space to put your belongings (carry shopping bags was a bad idea). There isn't a lot of room for seating, everyone seems to be squished. I was glad that I got seated in one of the regular chairs and I got the view the kitchen.\n\nFood: 4.5/5 DELICIOUS! Like many people probably said already, the broth here is super rich and creamy. I ordered the Spicy Tori Paitan with an order of egg while my bf got the spicy lamb ramen. First off before I go rambling about my ramen, the spicy lamb broth was a little salty for me. Okay, so the first sip of soup I took was life changing. The broths was perfectly delicious and the both of us would have to agree. This place is prefect for those whole appreciates a thick broth. After few bites in, the broth got too overwhelming for me and I realized that I did not enjoy it as much as my first bite (which is worth every penny). I would say that the noodle grabs onto the soup really well and the soft boiled egg was prefect with the runny yolk. The chashu had the perfect meat to fat ratio; the piece of meat literally melted in my mouth. No chewing was needed! The overall texture of the ramen was great because of the complexity of the toppings that accompanies the noodle.  \n\nPrice: 4/5 It is quite pricey for a bowl of ramen here. The Spicy Tori Paitan ramen that I got was $17 and the spicy lamb was $16. The portion size was like any other ramen shop but it is super filling because of the broth. I would say that it is worth every penny of your money because the ramen is just that good. \n\nCustomer Service: 2.5/5 I feel like I didn't really receive much customer service while I was her. The waitresses all seem super busy to even notice us. Our server just brought over some water, took our order, and brought out the ramen. I don't like how there is an 18% automatic charge for service fee when I feel like the service wasn't that great. \n\nOverall, you must come and try at least once. It will be life changing, I promise! Although the price is a little high for ramen and the wait is terrible, I think it's worth a try. I probably won't be coming here again unless it's for a special occasion or something. The wait time is just too long for me.

In addition, we ordered the Oysters in Shoyu Oil ($5) for three piece. The oysters were so delicious and absolutely worth a try.

One day, I noticed a long line of people waiting outside the Alcazar Theatre and wondered what the hoopla was all about. It suddenly clicked that this was one of the most anticipated opening of a Ramen shop straight from Japan. \n\nChef and owner Tomoharu Shono's Mensho Tokyo is one of many restaurants he owns in Japan, and this is the first restaurant opened outside of Japan. I think it's fitting he chose San Francisco as we have been starved of good, authentic Ramen for so long. Most of my \"best Ramen experience\" so far have been in L.A., Vegas and the Peninsula. \n\nDuring the next couple months while walking pass this place, I would often gauge at the line and figured it would eventually die down but that never happened. So this past Sunday, I tried to convince the Wifey to get here early prior to their opening time, but she didn't want to \"waste\" time waiting in line and instead we got here around 7PM. You gotta have patience and brave the crackheads and crazies if you want some good Ramen and it better be worth it....and it was. \n\nAfter about an hour, we finally got seated and we both had the Tori Paitan Ramen (Double Chasu) and Oysters in Dare Oil, the only appetizer they served. The oysters had a subtle smoky and soy sauce flavor that was quite delightful, but may be an acquired taste for some. The Ramen is a creamy mixture of chicken soup with two slices of pork belly, two slices of duck breast, menma (bamboo shoots), burdock, kale and Katsuobushi sauce. \n\nThe broth of the Ramen was thick, rich, creamy that was not too overpowering and it was quite an exquisite flavor bursting of umami. The noodles were thicker and cooked al dente to which I thoroughly enjoyed as it had a good snap to it. Now, had this been in Japan, I would have been slurping the noodles as the technique aerates the noodles and the broth, allowing the flavors to mellow out and fully develop before you chew and swallow. It also cools off your mouthful of noodles just enough to let you enjoy them while the rest of the bowl stays piping hot.\n\nHowever....I couldn't get myself to do it since we are in a communal table. I was tempted to, but this ain't Japan and I wanted to eat \"politely\" to the rest of the patrons eating beside me. Regardless, we were enjoying our bowls of Ramen as these were right up there with some of the best we've had so far. \n\nSide note: I did some researching on the Chef and I am excited to see what bold new flavors he can come up with next. There's a particular lamb-based broth he made in Japan and wonder if he can recreate that here. He also can't make the same exact broths as he would like here due to health codes and regulations.

Unfortunately, no one opened the door, as everyone just peered through the window, watching the staff working on the computer system.... Wait 5 minutes, nothing. Wait 10 minutes, nothing. Wait 30 minutes, finally, the head hostess comes out.\n\n\"Sorry, but our system is not accepting credit card. We can only accept cash. Please go to an ATM.\" Are you kidding me? I think cash-only establishments are OK, and I have no problem with this. But really? It took you 30 minutes to let us know this? Of course, all of us in line have been waiting and waiting, so we all make a dash to the nearest ATM. I think it makes more sense to let us know at the very beginning there was issues, so while we inevitably wait more in line, we can go get some cash......... amiright?\n\nFurther insult to injury. we didn't get seated for another 15 minutes... So really, 45 minutes after \"opening.\" It doesn't make common sense.\n\nAnyway, had the Tori Paitan ramen and the Vegan Tantanmen.\n-Tori Paitan: Deep chicken broth flavor. Very creamy and filling. I think I heard it described as a chicken soup for rich people. I may be able to buy into this description. For our patience in line, we got an extra chashu (which is not the best anyway). Noodles were very enjoyable, al dente, and on point. However, the broth just didn't do it for me.\n-Vegan tantanmen: Surprisingly, I will have to rate this above the tori paitan. The flavor is fuller and more complex. It has almost a nutty quality to it, so if you don't like nuts, would not suggest this one. But it was always very creamy and filly of a broth. Noodles the same. \n\nUnfortunately, given the late start and unreasonable wait without explanation (and even with an explanation, still does not explain make us wait beyond the opening time), I have to rate an overall 2 stars.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but it was just too damn rich and creamy, almost as if they had poured cups and cups of cream and milk. I definitely wasn't able to consume much of the broth after getting through the ramen and for hours after my meal, I felt like I was going to be sick. If (IF!) I were to come back again (maybe when it's raining and there's no ridiculous line), I'd try the Shoyu broth instead. \n- so there's kale in your ramen...but no option to add an egg?

If you don't count the screeching homeless woman who kept sauntering by, no one else showed up until around 4:35PM. That's not to say the staff was indifferent to my presence as they thanked me for coming and waiting patiently. Eventually a line did start to form and rather quickly. I got seated at the front counter promptly at 5PM where I had a nice view of the kitchen where activity was bustling behind he coffee beakers with the broth at full boil and the pork and duck chashu being meticulously sliced. I was sitting with a Filipino family who could barely contain their enthusiasm over the forthcoming noodlefest.\n\nI was feeling the same way and knew what to order since I had well over an hour to decide. I started with their one and only appetizer, the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. There were four of them completely shelled and marinated (photo: http://bit.ly/1Vp0sEV). Tasty freshness gone too soon, but the main event was about to occur. It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls.

I normally order tonkotsu at ramen places, so the chicken flavor was definitely something different to try out. \n\nThe noodles are round and thicker than your average (think chow mein noodle size), but perfectly cooked and chewy. As for the toppings, the chasu was melt in your mouth delicious, but the duck was subpar for me. My friends and I also thought there should be a little more veggies just to lighten up the heavy bowl. I liked the bonito flakes, but the small amounts of kale and bamboo shoots did not cut it for us. But we did really like the toppings on the tables! The red salt was something we'd never seen before, and the other brown seasoning (smells like bonito flakes) was pretty tasty.\n\nBy the time we left at 6 pm, the line outside was crazy! If you don't like waiting, definitely don't come around that time. You're better off coming anywhere from 4-4:30 pm. The restaurant seats less than 30 people at one time, and it seems like there's a slow turnover rate.

Ok, not just \"toast\" but phuckin' bougie, tweezified toast. \n\nThis year, it's $15 coffee (for one cup!) and $18 ramen.\n\nBecause, San Francisco! \n\nNext year, I'm bracing myself for $100 pizza. Oh wait, we already had that during the super bowl (well, I didn't but it was available at Tony's Pizza Napoletana). \n\nSeriously, what's next? \n\nKindly let me know so I can start harvesting my eggs to sell! \n\n$18 ramen may sound crazy but people waited 3+ hours for this ramen on opening night! \n\n$18 for a taste of Tokyo? Why not! \n\nMensho's first U.S. location is one of the most, if not the most highly anticipated restaurant opening this year in SF! \n\nTip: Come at 4 pm (earlier on the weekends) or after 10 pm to avoid long wait times. \n\nCurrently, Mensho has 4 ramen options available ($9-$18) with a single or double chashu option. When the owner returns from Japan in March, their menu will expand. No housemade noodles yet. They have a noodle machine but are awaiting permit(s) to use it (same for the tonkotsu equipment). Disappointingly no marinated soft boiled egg is available but maybe in the future? Beer only; no sake, soda, or juice.\n\nMy friend and I ordered three bowls of ramen to share:\n\n(1) Tori Paitan: Rich, creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce | double chashu $18\nhttp://bit.ly/1XrzETT\n\nOur favorite of the three, the kotteri broth was deliciously creamy (gravy-like) and richly satisfying. It had great depth of umami flavor but did get a bit gritty mid-way. The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of). I tried Nojo's last night and there's absolutely no comparison. Mensho's is infinitely superior. \n\n(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\nhttp://bit.ly/1QfmuKm\n\nA much lighter assari broth but saltier with a slight sweetness since it's a soy sauce based. The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast. He was uber nice and offered to answer any questions I had. Really cool guy! \n\nThe space is small and only seats 28 - two communal tables and four seats at the counter. We choose to sit at the counter. There's more privacy (if you're on a date) and you can watch the chefs in action.\n\nRead all signs before parking. Do NOT park on Geary from 4-6 pm (tow-away zone) on the weekdays, otherwise your $18 bowl of ramen will turn into a $618+ bowl of ramen. \n\nBecause, San Francisco!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Once we got in, we both ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen (Double Chashu) $18.

"], "author": "Lenerd J.", "review": "I've passed this place a couple of times and there's ALWAYS a long line (at least 10+ people) but this time friend and I got there around 8:15ishPM and we waited about 15-20 mins - there were 4-5 groups in front of us. Mostly pairs of people. We got to the front of the line and there's a menu on a podium. There was a note that this is a \"Gratuity Free\" restaurant - a flat rate of 15% is added to all diners check. This was a little off putting at first but I came to agree with the flat rate percentage. I'll make more comments further below to support my decision.\n\nAmbiance and seating:\n\nGreat ambiance. They have three main tables: the largest seating 10-12 individuals and the other two tables seat 6 people each. The tables are elevated and have barstool seats. The tables are interesting in a sense that there's a gap built into the table, large enough to slide a thin-ish purse (anything wider than 3 inches might not fit) or a wallet and phone into the space if you don't want to put your purse on the floor. There is a coat hook by the door (I believe another person posted a photo of this). My friend and I were seated across from each over and next to us was another pair. Seating is a shared experience - most people seem to be seated across from their partner with exception of one pair that sat side to side. The fact that they only have three tables sort of suggests this. The ambiance is very welcoming, bright, and clean. Lots of chatter and you may need to raise your voice a little bit to hear your friend/SO, but definitely nice. Music in the background seemed pretty varied. It wasn't stuck on a specific radio with one type of music. There was also a TV mounted above the rest room, but it was playing on mute and no captions. It appeared to be on a loop and I believe it was more of an infomercial for the restaurant (?) - unclear.\n\nThe FOOD:\n\nFriend and I ordered the same thing: the Tori Paitan Ramen with a soy sauce egg (+$1.80/each). Menu doesn't offer that ramen as spicy but you can request Habanero (+$2/each) to spice it up - it came out in a slightly chopped/pulverized paste; makes it easier to mix into the broth in my opinion. We also ordered fried garlic (+$2) which came out in a diced form (see photo). I tried the broth first and it was sooooo delicious!! It had a milkier consistency than what I've had at other ramen places but the balance was great. It wasn't too salty nor under seasoned but just right. The chasiu was SO perfect - cooked to the point where it's falling apart when you try to bite down. I LOVED the texture and al dente-ness of the ramen. I personally prefer ramen noodles (and wonton noodles) with more of a resistance when I bite into it. I hate it when noodles are cooked to the point that they're falling apart when I pick them up with chop sticks. I cannot rave enough about their noodles!!! There were a few leaves of kale, some cabbage, bamboo shoots, and some fried/baked veg that I can't put my finger on that was also in the broth.I recognize the fried/baked beg but can't remember the name. At some point, friend and I weren't talking. We were slurping and eating intensely.\n\nThe drink menu consisted mostly of Asian (?) beers, sake, and soju. I don't believe any sodas were on the menu. Water is always an option \n\nThe SERVICE:\n\nGreat! There were three ladies taking orders,serving, and clearing tables. All of them were efficient and unobtrusive. Sometimes I feel very rushed or I'm waiting a long time to place my order but here, it felt like when I glanced around, one of the ladies immediately sensed my eyes and came right over. Everyone had a smile and was offering refills at a good rate. Food came out about 10 mins after ordering and when we were slowing down and coming to the end of our meal, I didn't feel pressured to hurry up, pay, and get out. We slowly savored the broth and when WE were done, someone came up and asked if they could take away our bowls - definitely appreciate the attention the servers give. Not too much but enough to know they're there. \n\nAll in all I would DEFINITELY come here again...I'll keep my fingers crossed that there won't be a hella long line.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-09-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I got the Tori paitan ramen and my friends got the spicy lamb and Tori paitan x2 chasu.

But I have heard great things about the vegan ramen and I would want to try that the next time I come back. The quality of the ramen soup is extremely thick, less like a broth and more like a sauce. Although the quantity does not look like much, it will be very filling because of how dense the soup is. Someone also ordered the mazesoba, which is known for a spicy kick and is very delicious. You can get it at a variety of spice levels, but even the medium was pretty hot. Their spicy doesn't \"linger\" the way chili paste sometimes can, but I don't know if I would be able to handle an entire dish of that. We also asked for a recommendation of sake and got the Dassai, which was so good it got me reading a bunch of articles about sake making.\n\nMy recommendation would be to go with people you like because you should just expect a wait of some substance, know that you will be dropping about $20 for a bowl of ramen, and just enjoy the experience without getting hung up on that other stuff.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-04-04"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen with extra Chashu.

The Ramen comes with both duck and pork chashu (1 slice of each in the regular Ramen and two slices of each in the double). The duck chashu was an interesting addition. As my friend commented, you could definitely taste the lemon. To me, it felt a little out of place in the creamy broth, but whatever floats your boat. The PORK chashu though. Omigod. I'm already a sucker for pork, so this absolutely stole my heart. \n\nAbout a third of the way through the meal, however, I could definitely feel some regret. It was sooo rich, maybe a little too rich for my personal taste. I think if I had to do it over, I'd personally try one of the lighter broths but hey- maybe you'll like it more!\n\nOverall, really delicious Ramen and a place I'd definitely recommend trying. Was it worth 1.5 hours of waiting? Not so much.

Waiters were all very nice and responsive. They forgot our double chashu and were a little quick to blame us for not ordering correctly rather than taking the blame for not taking down our orders correctly in the first place (we made sure to double check that it was double chashu when ordering). There are baskets under the table for your things, and coat hooks by the door. Decor was slick and urban -- big glass windows, communal wood tables, stool seating -- but still somewhat cozy because of the small space. If you're on a date, get ready to sit across from the other person, because they won't let you sit side by side (the table width is pretty wide). We were lucky enough to be able to trade with another couple to sit side by side. (Personally, I prefer this because I don't like to watch people eat, you're closer to the other person, and it makes sharing food easier, but I understand why they make this rule since there's high customer turnover.) Bathrooms were clean, which is a good sign to me of the level of kitchen cleanliness.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back!

A two-plus-hour wait for an $18 bowl of ramen sounds like a Louis C.K. joke about San Francisco millennials with no punchline. I got exhausted thinking about the hoops I'd have to jump through to get a taste of the broth here. However, now that at least six weeks have elapsed since the grand opening in February, I had an opening that I couldn't bypass, the Thursday before Good Friday when I got off work early.\n\nEveryone says to be there at 4PM even though they don't open until an hour later, and so I did. If you don't count the screeching homeless woman who kept sauntering by, no one else showed up until around 4:35PM. That's not to say the staff was indifferent to my presence as they thanked me for coming and waiting patiently. Eventually a line did start to form and rather quickly. I got seated at the front counter promptly at 5PM where I had a nice view of the kitchen where activity was bustling behind he coffee beakers with the broth at full boil and the pork and duck chashu being meticulously sliced. I was sitting with a Filipino family who could barely contain their enthusiasm over the forthcoming noodlefest.\n\nI was feeling the same way and knew what to order since I had well over an hour to decide. I started with their one and only appetizer, the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. There were four of them completely shelled and marinated (photo: http://bit.ly/1Vp0sEV). Tasty freshness gone too soon, but the main event was about to occur. It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls. I was timid and just had a $4.75 bottle of Sapporo Premium to wash it all down (photo: http://bit.ly/1RTN9dq), but they have pricier Japanese artisan beers which they strongly recommended to me for the next time.

I don't mind, as long as I have elbow room and have good food!\n\nWhile in line, we checked out the menu and had a face palm moment when I realized that the description described the items below. Basically, the items below the header start with the basic bowl, and increase in price for additional items. So the four categories are: tori paitan (most ordered based on pictures and reviews), shoyu (what I ordered), shio, and vegan tantanmen.\n\nWhen the shoyu ramen arrived, I quickly dug in because I was so hungry. The duck chasu and pork chasu was tender, perfectly cooked, and enhanced the broth (wishing there were doubles of each!). Even the kale was an unusual, but nice addition. The broth was perfect, not salty or oily. And the noodles were chewy! At first, it doesn't look like there's a lot of noodles, but the bowl is shaped quite deeply at the bottom, so all the noodles are hidden there. There was so much I liked about this ramen. \n\nI couldn't figure out what the seasonings on the table were, though there was pink himalayan salt, and maybe some other seasonings to personally enhance the broth to the right taste. I didn't need to as I liked it the way it was.\n\nThe waiter was very kind and smiling, which is something I don't see too often. All the seating is on stools, and there are baskets on the ground for bags. The whole inside has a clean and modern aesthetic, with a living wall at the entrance, descriptions of the different types of ramen, and a view into the kitchen.

Somebody will kindly let you know that there are other patrons outside who are waiting.\n\nIt's hard to say if I would wait in line for another hour, but I would come back to arrive right around opening so I don't have to wait so long.

We arrived around 8:30 pm on a Sunday evening, and the wait was most definitely real. It took us an hour to get into the restaurant, but only about ten minutes between getting seated and getting our bowl of delicious ramen served to us.\n\nAnyways, while I wanted so badly to believe that Mensho was going to be the bomb.com, I found myself enjoying the bowl of ramen greatly, though unlikely to ever return back (well, maybe if the lines die down).\n\nThe current Mensho menu that everyone posts on the wall is actually an aspirational menu--we chatted with the waitresses and apparently they won't really be serving tsukemen until at least May/June. I was bummed out because the Bay Area has a real shortage of good tsukemen (besides Iza); they currently are serving a Vegan tsukemen if you're into that, but relative to their more popular dishes, I feel like most people are more inclined to try their more popular dishes. We got the following dishes -- I'll do broth and overall reviews and then noodle and content reviews since both bowls basically served the same thing:\n\nChicken paitan -- the must have for everyone who comes here. I really was not a fan of the chicken paitan. If you love your broths thick and creamy, this is the ramen for you. SO described it like a creamy chicken noodle soup -- flavor was rich, but not particularly nuanced or complex. Overall, easy to have a couple bites of, but you better have a high tolerance for creaminess, otherwise this dish is going to be hard to finish.\n\nOrganic shoyu -- I enjoyed this and actually found it be a good ramen. The broth is very light, perhaps salty, but I have a high tolerance for saltiness so I'm not a great judge of that. I thought the flavor was quite delicious, though the soup itself was definitely quite oily. Overall, I enjoyed it, and would have again. The noodles were interesting because they were flat noodles with speckles on it.... never seen that before, but they worked well with the soup.\n\nOverall, noodles for both dishes were good -- they were appropriate complements to their soup base. The contents of the dish were interesting -- the chasu is good, but what I particularly enjoyed was the duck chasu, which I've never had before. I like duck to start with, so it was a nice textural shift to what people are normally used to in ramen. \n\nI was impressed with the careful attention to detail -- they served the chicken paitan with a wooden spoon and the organic shoyu with a flat metal one, perhaps because the flat metal one wouldn't have been quite as appropriate for the creamy paitan, but maybe we were overthinking it. \n\nFinal price was $40, so definitely on the higher end, but given how expensive everything in the city is, I was pretty happy to have a $40 meal.\n\nOverall, I found the ramen to be fairly good here, maybe not the best ever, but given the ridiculous wait times, it's hard to want to come back because it's not good enough to wait an hour for. Ippudo is also opening in Berkeley within the year, so will be interesting to see how these two big Japanese ramen stores do when they're all situated.\n\ntldr; certainly good ramen with a higher price, but you will likely have to wait an hour for it -- I wouldn't do it again, but I did like the ramen. just didn't like it THAT much.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-17"}, {"excerpts": ["(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup", ", shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\n"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "4.5 STARS\n\nSan Franciscans love shiny new places (and things). \n\nWhen it comes to the hottest new restaurant and food trends, many of us spare no expense with our paycheck (and time).\n\nLast year, it was $8 for toast.

When the owner returns from Japan in March, their menu will expand. No housemade noodles yet. They have a noodle machine but are awaiting permit(s) to use it (same for the tonkotsu equipment). Disappointingly no marinated soft boiled egg is available but maybe in the future? Beer only; no sake, soda, or juice.\n\nMy friend and I ordered three bowls of ramen to share:\n\n(1) Tori Paitan: Rich, creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce | double chashu $18\nhttp://bit.ly/1XrzETT\n\nOur favorite of the three, the kotteri broth was deliciously creamy (gravy-like) and richly satisfying. It had great depth of umami flavor but did get a bit gritty mid-way. The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of). I tried Nojo's last night and there's absolutely no comparison. Mensho's is infinitely superior. \n\n(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\nhttp://bit.ly/1QfmuKm\n\nA much lighter assari broth but saltier with a slight sweetness since it's a soy sauce based. The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast. He was uber nice and offered to answer any questions I had. Really cool guy! \n\nThe space is small and only seats 28 - two communal tables and four seats at the counter. We choose to sit at the counter. There's more privacy (if you're on a date) and you can watch the chefs in action.\n\nRead all signs before parking. Do NOT park on Geary from 4-6 pm (tow-away zone) on the weekdays, otherwise your $18 bowl of ramen will turn into a $618+ bowl of ramen. \n\nBecause, San Francisco!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["My husband got the Organic Shoyu which was served with a clear, organic chicken and pork broth.

This time I ordered the Shio and my friend ordered the Organic Shoyu. Shio was much better than the Tori Paitan I ordered before, but I thought my bowl was a little bit salty. I tried the Shoyu which tasted similar to the Shio but with a kick of light soy sauce. Noodles were great again, pork was not bad, but flawed in the broth again. I was hoping second time around would have me agree with everyone else, but with the amount of ramen bowls I've had, I can't help but compare.\n\nOVERALL: Mensho has great texture and taste for their noodles and decent pork, however although their broths are unique and somewhat similar to Japan, it still does not quite hit the spot. If you really want authentic ramen, hit up Clint at Noodle in Haystack and reserve one of his pop up ramen dinners!

I think it was hard to notice the chashu in the tori paitan, due to the decadence of the soup, but in the shoyu, the chashu is a fatty standout. probably the best chashu in a ramen that i've had. the noodles in the shoyu are good, but different - thinner and lighter than it's tori paitan counterpart. it paired well w/ the shoyu broth. The broth itself tasted like bonito more than shoyu. \n\n\nI would not come back for these two ramen dishes, but I still want to come back to try the other options.

We were seated within 20 minutes of my dropping him off.\n\nWhen we were at the front of the line, the server asked us what we wanted to order. This way our food would be served to us shortly after we were seated. As others have mentioned, this is communal type seating in a small space. I couldn't quite carry a conversation with my husband because it was so loud.\n\nWe ordered (1) enoki chips (2) tori paitan chashu ramen (3) organic shoyu double chashu ramen (3) sansho beer. We received the organic shoyu ramen first which was slightly fishy and caught me off guard. It wasn't bad just very different. The noodle were also flat noodles, which was also different from other ramen places I've tried. Next we receive the tori pain tan which came with noodles similar to chow mein. We both preferred the tori paitan broth. It was much richer and, for lack of a better word, the texture of the soup was \"fluffy.\" We then received our appetizer, which was fried enoki. We never had a dish like it and would order it again.\n\nService at the establishment needs work. The communal tables have these weird cubbies that the workers place setting in them. Without an excuse me, the workers would reach into the cubbies and startle patrons. I would never expect for someone to reach for something in front of my stomach. They should either (1) learn to say excuse me (2) place these setting elsewhere. I'm not one that dings an establishment for service but more of an FYI.\n\nWould I go back? Only if the wait didn't exceed the one we experienced. Considering the price point (our tab was over $60 with tip), I can't justify waiting 1+ hours for ramen with mediocre service. Was it good?

The chashu was generous and delicious: a soft and fatty round of simmered pork, with two juicy slices of duck meat on the side. The tori paitan is thick and rich, for those of you who like a ramen with more body, and the noodles are appropriately matched. Agreed with others that the sprig of kale isn't much to my liking, and I miss having some of my Japanese ramen favorites (menma is a big one for me), but the fried gobo is excellent and adds a flavor that a lot of Americans aren't familiar with. The shio ramen at $9 is the single best value bowl of ramen I've had in the US: the shoyu just edges it out, but for those looking for something delicious that won't weigh you down, it's a proper shio ramen with a strong chicken flavor. The garlic tends to settle on the bottom, which leads to an interesting shift in flavor as you make your way through the bowl and the garlic sits longer in the remaining soup.\n\nThis feels like a shop transplanted from Tokyo (which it is), and beats out every one of the other 36 ramen shops I've tried across the US to take the title of #1. It competes handily with the best shops in Tokyo as well. The interior is beautifully appointed, clean, and modern, and I love that they've turned the entire restaurant into counter seating (albeit with the concession of counter-height tables for groups) for a more Japanese dining experience.\n\nThey're not launching with everything on the menu, and they're waiting on the go-ahead from the health department before they can start making their own noodles with the machine that they imported from Japan, but Mensho Tokyo is already far and away better than anything else available in the area. Can't wait until they finish sourcing ingredients and start serving additional items from the menu! When that happens, we'll finally be able to have proper tsukemen in the Bay Area.

The noodles were a great texture, and the meat toppings were amazingly tender, but the soup really needed something to lighten it.\n\nBy the end, the soup itself also started to taste and feel gritty.

Hella flavor! \n\nNormally, it's $16 for a bowl but you only get one piece of meat so I'd recommend getting a double chashu for $18.

I don't mind, as long as I have elbow room and have good food!\n\nWhile in line, we checked out the menu and had a face palm moment when I realized that the description described the items below. Basically, the items below the header start with the basic bowl, and increase in price for additional items. So the four categories are: tori paitan (most ordered based on pictures and reviews), shoyu (what I ordered), shio, and vegan tantanmen.\n\nWhen the shoyu ramen arrived, I quickly dug in because I was so hungry. The duck chasu and pork chasu was tender, perfectly cooked, and enhanced the broth (wishing there were doubles of each!). Even the kale was an unusual, but nice addition. The broth was perfect, not salty or oily. And the noodles were chewy! At first, it doesn't look like there's a lot of noodles, but the bowl is shaped quite deeply at the bottom, so all the noodles are hidden there. There was so much I liked about this ramen. \n\nI couldn't figure out what the seasonings on the table were, though there was pink himalayan salt, and maybe some other seasonings to personally enhance the broth to the right taste. I didn't need to as I liked it the way it was.\n\nThe waiter was very kind and smiling, which is something I don't see too often. All the seating is on stools, and there are baskets on the ground for bags. The whole inside has a clean and modern aesthetic, with a living wall at the entrance, descriptions of the different types of ramen, and a view into the kitchen. So exciting!\n\nOne downside is that this isn't a place to sit and chat after you've eaten the food. Somebody will kindly let you know that there are other patrons outside who are waiting.\n\nIt's hard to say if I would wait in line for another hour, but I would come back to arrive right around opening so I don't have to wait so long.

We only waited an hour compared to some of the crazy 3 hours that other people have waited. All 4 of us ordered the tori paitan ramen ($16), which was seemingly the most popular! We were all really excited especially just to be some of the first people in the restaurant. \n\nThe tori paitan was incredibly flavorful, creamy, and THICK! Like others have said, the tori paitan broth has more of a sauce or gravy-like consistency rather than your normal thinner broth. If you don't like heavy meals... don't get the tori paitan. You're probably better off with the lighter shoyu or shio ramen (both look delicious!). The tori paitan broth got a bit too rich as I was finishing the bowl. However, I enjoyed it! I normally order tonkotsu at ramen places, so the chicken flavor was definitely something different to try out. \n\nThe noodles are round and thicker than your average (think chow mein noodle size), but perfectly cooked and chewy. As for the toppings, the chasu was melt in your mouth delicious, but the duck was subpar for me. My friends and I also thought there should be a little more veggies just to lighten up the heavy bowl. I liked the bonito flakes, but the small amounts of kale and bamboo shoots did not cut it for us. But we did really like the toppings on the tables! The red salt was something we'd never seen before, and the other brown seasoning (smells like bonito flakes) was pretty tasty.\n\nBy the time we left at 6 pm, the line outside was crazy! If you don't like waiting, definitely don't come around that time. You're better off coming anywhere from 4-4:30 pm.

Ok, not just \"toast\" but phuckin' bougie, tweezified toast. \n\nThis year, it's $15 coffee (for one cup!) and $18 ramen.\n\nBecause, San Francisco! \n\nNext year, I'm bracing myself for $100 pizza. Oh wait, we already had that during the super bowl (well, I didn't but it was available at Tony's Pizza Napoletana). \n\nSeriously, what's next? \n\nKindly let me know so I can start harvesting my eggs to sell! \n\n$18 ramen may sound crazy but people waited 3+ hours for this ramen on opening night! \n\n$18 for a taste of Tokyo? Why not! \n\nMensho's first U.S. location is one of the most, if not the most highly anticipated restaurant opening this year in SF! \n\nTip: Come at 4 pm (earlier on the weekends) or after 10 pm to avoid long wait times. \n\nCurrently, Mensho has 4 ramen options available ($9-$18) with a single or double chashu option. When the owner returns from Japan in March, their menu will expand. No housemade noodles yet. They have a noodle machine but are awaiting permit(s) to use it (same for the tonkotsu equipment). Disappointingly no marinated soft boiled egg is available but maybe in the future? Beer only; no sake, soda, or juice.\n\nMy friend and I ordered three bowls of ramen to share:\n\n(1) Tori Paitan: Rich, creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce | double chashu $18\nhttp://bit.ly/1XrzETT\n\nOur favorite of the three, the kotteri broth was deliciously creamy (gravy-like) and richly satisfying. It had great depth of umami flavor but did get a bit gritty mid-way. The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of). I tried Nojo's last night and there's absolutely no comparison. Mensho's is infinitely superior. \n\n(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\nhttp://bit.ly/1QfmuKm\n\nA much lighter assari broth but saltier with a slight sweetness since it's a soy sauce based. The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast. He was uber nice and offered to answer any questions I had. Really cool guy! \n\nThe space is small and only seats 28 - two communal tables and four seats at the counter. We choose to sit at the counter. There's more privacy (if you're on a date) and you can watch the chefs in action.\n\nRead all signs before parking. Do NOT park on Geary from 4-6 pm (tow-away zone) on the weekdays, otherwise your $18 bowl of ramen will turn into a $618+ bowl of ramen. \n\nBecause, San Francisco!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Since I had just burned through my wallet on drinks, I opted for the lower priced Shio Ramen w/ Chasiu ($9 something, ~$11 w/ tip and tax).

The server who looked like the manager was too into getting customers in n out of the restaurant it felt like I was in a food competition where I had to eat as fast as I could. I felt so rushed I could barely enjoy what I was eating. I get that the place is very small and you have a line outside the door but if I am going to pay for over priced ramen I would want to enjoy it. Not only did I feel so rushed trying to finish my food the server denied a customer because they wanted to share a bowl of ramen. I thought this was ridiculous and honestly felt bad for the 2 people who had to leave. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. To be honest, I would not wait outside to eat at this place. I ordered the Shio Ramen and was very oily. Besides the broth the pork was soft and tender. They add a lot of bamboo to your ramen which I thought was a plus. I really do not understand why this place has so much hype.

The soup was a great change of pace from the same old tepid, weak tonkotsu broth with curly pre-frozen noodles that you can get elsewhere in the area. The chashu was generous and delicious: a soft and fatty round of simmered pork, with two juicy slices of duck meat on the side. The tori paitan is thick and rich, for those of you who like a ramen with more body, and the noodles are appropriately matched. Agreed with others that the sprig of kale isn't much to my liking, and I miss having some of my Japanese ramen favorites (menma is a big one for me), but the fried gobo is excellent and adds a flavor that a lot of Americans aren't familiar with. The shio ramen at $9 is the single best value bowl of ramen I've had in the US: the shoyu just edges it out, but for those looking for something delicious that won't weigh you down, it's a proper shio ramen with a strong chicken flavor. The garlic tends to settle on the bottom, which leads to an interesting shift in flavor as you make your way through the bowl and the garlic sits longer in the remaining soup.\n\nThis feels like a shop transplanted from Tokyo (which it is), and beats out every one of the other 36 ramen shops I've tried across the US to take the title of #1. It competes handily with the best shops in Tokyo as well. The interior is beautifully appointed, clean, and modern, and I love that they've turned the entire restaurant into counter seating (albeit with the concession of counter-height tables for groups) for a more Japanese dining experience.\n\nThey're not launching with everything on the menu, and they're waiting on the go-ahead from the health department before they can start making their own noodles with the machine that they imported from Japan, but Mensho Tokyo is already far and away better than anything else available in the area.

In fact, we kept alternating between the two because each one seemed to make the other one taste awesomer and each was awesome by itself.\n- The oysters!

Don't tell anyone but I actually licked the oil off the mini plate after the oysters were gone.  \n- The Sansho beer, which is perhaps my favorite \"herbal\" beer ever - with a hint of Japanese peppercorn.

I liked the noodles in this one better than the other two.  I do think that overall, these aren't the best ramen noodles I've ever had. I like mine with more bite/chew to them. These noodles were maybe 1-2 mins too long. Also, towards the middle to the end of the bowl, I got a lot of residue/grit/something.

Too soggy and they were different than the tori paitan noodles and not springy at all. \n\n3.) shio:  this was was also nice. Good, clean flavor. I like the garlic in this, also.

We've said goodbye to our Indian summer in SF, so that means, pull out the chunky sweaters and scarves and head over to Mensho Tokyo in the 'Loin to warm up your soul with some incredibly rich ramen.\n\nThis is the first Japanese outpost outside of Tokyo and I loved that the owners chose SF. (why should NYC get all the cool places all the time?!) Years ago, I used to whine to my friends that I'll have to drive to San Mateo to get some fantastic ramen. But, now that we actually have choices, I can happily stay in SF and my friends don't have to hear my whining. \n\nFirst: YES. There is always a line. Come right when they open at 5pm or maybe closer to 11:30pm (but what if the soup runs out?) chances are, your wait will be less than an hour. There were 3 of us who waited around 530pm and got sat down in 20 mins. \n\nSecond: it's all communal seating. Most are high tops where you will uncomfortably balance yourself. So, leave the kids with a babysitter and don't bring big groups. You will rub elbows with your neighbors. You won't have much space for your said purse/jacket/scarves, but there are baskets on the floor where you can store them, just like in Tokyo!\n\nThird: get the Tori Paitan. Everyone talks about it, right? it's their signature bowl. At $16, you get rich and creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, Kale, Burdock and katsuobushi sauce. I love duck and I love that they give you duck here. Double up and pay the extra $2 for another slice of MMMeat. If you got vegan friends, say hello to their Vegan Tantanmen with made several types of mushrooms, nuts, chili oil, etc. in premium Japanese soy cream. You won't miss the real thing. Trust. \n\nFourth: the broth is like GRAVY. Is that groovy? if you think so (I think so!) then you'll love this place. If you prefer a lighter, cleaner taste, you won't like Mensho and you'll be pissed that you waited an hour in line for this sh*t. \n\nFifth: just like in Tokyo, eat your ramen, don't linger and leave.

Most recently, I came because I had heard about their new matcha tori paitan ramen and wanted to give that a shot.\n\nI came right before they opened, around 4:45 on Wednesday, and there was only a handful of people in line. To be fair, it was a hot day--maybe 80 degrees--and only the most dedicated Mensho fans would even attempt ramen in that weather. The heat was definitely a barrier to enjoying the ramen; let's just say that I've been to Mensho many times but the lack of AC has never bothered me until this meal...\n\nBut was the matcha tori paitan worth it? YES it was! At $17 a bowl, it definitely doesn't come cheap, but I appreciated the subtle addition of the matcha to the already fabulous tori paitan ramen. Both my friend and I thought that the matcha flavor was very subtle and you had to stop and think about the flavors in your mouth to really taste it. Other than that, everything else about this dish is the same. The soup is still deliciously rich and creamy, the noodles thick and satisfying to chew, and the duck and pork chashu slices were perfectly tender. \n\nAlso, I want to call out that they offer soft boiled eggs now! Unfortunately it's not included in the base ramen, so you have to fork out another $1.80 to add it, but it is completely worth it. I'm just really grateful that they've started offering it here, since for the longest time they didn't. I've had a lot of good ramen eggs before, but even then I think the one at Mensho is one of my favorites. It comes as a whole egg instead of sliced in half, and when you bite into it, you can see the perfectly partially cooked egg yolk inside. Plus it's marinated perfectly and that first bite of the marinated egg white and half cooked york is really memorable.\n\nMy friend and I also shared the poke soba ($18) as we were intrigued by the 10 bowl limit per day, but I would recommend skipping this. Because it was called poke soba, I thought all the proteins in the dish would be seafood, but for some reason there was also chashu in there. It ended up being a weird combination of warm and cold ingredients (the soba was also warm). Also we underestimated how full we'd be from the ramen. By the time we both finished with our tori paitan and were ready to start on the poke soba, we were already feeling pretty stuffed...\n\nAnother friend ordered the vegan tantanmen as he is vegetarian, and he was blown away by how delicious and flavorful the ramen is.

You can either wait in line later, or you can wait in line before it opens. We chose the latter. We got there at 430pm, expecting to wait 30 minutes for the 5pm opening. Luckily, there was only 1 person ahead of us. Was able to walk down the street grab a cup of coffee from Starbucks and return without any problems.\n\nCome 5 pm, window shades open. Pristine, small, clean dining room with the kitchen in the back. You could just anticipate a good ramen experience. Appeared it was well-staffed. Unfortunately, no one opened the door, as everyone just peered through the window, watching the staff working on the computer system.... Wait 5 minutes, nothing. Wait 10 minutes, nothing. Wait 30 minutes, finally, the head hostess comes out.\n\n\"Sorry, but our system is not accepting credit card. We can only accept cash. Please go to an ATM.\" Are you kidding me? I think cash-only establishments are OK, and I have no problem with this. But really? It took you 30 minutes to let us know this? Of course, all of us in line have been waiting and waiting, so we all make a dash to the nearest ATM. I think it makes more sense to let us know at the very beginning there was issues, so while we inevitably wait more in line, we can go get some cash......... amiright?\n\nFurther insult to injury. we didn't get seated for another 15 minutes... So really, 45 minutes after \"opening.\" It doesn't make common sense.\n\nAnyway, had the Tori Paitan ramen and the Vegan Tantanmen.\n-Tori Paitan: Deep chicken broth flavor. Very creamy and filling. I think I heard it described as a chicken soup for rich people. I may be able to buy into this description. For our patience in line, we got an extra chashu (which is not the best anyway). Noodles were very enjoyable, al dente, and on point. However, the broth just didn't do it for me.\n-Vegan tantanmen: Surprisingly, I will have to rate this above the tori paitan. The flavor is fuller and more complex. It has almost a nutty quality to it, so if you don't like nuts, would not suggest this one. But it was always very creamy and filly of a broth. Noodles the same. \n\nUnfortunately, given the late start and unreasonable wait without explanation (and even with an explanation, still does not explain make us wait beyond the opening time), I have to rate an overall 2 stars.

A two-plus-hour wait for an $18 bowl of ramen sounds like a Louis C.K. joke about San Francisco millennials with no punchline. I got exhausted thinking about the hoops I'd have to jump through to get a taste of the broth here. However, now that at least six weeks have elapsed since the grand opening in February, I had an opening that I couldn't bypass, the Thursday before Good Friday when I got off work early.\n\nEveryone says to be there at 4PM even though they don't open until an hour later, and so I did. If you don't count the screeching homeless woman who kept sauntering by, no one else showed up until around 4:35PM. That's not to say the staff was indifferent to my presence as they thanked me for coming and waiting patiently. Eventually a line did start to form and rather quickly. I got seated at the front counter promptly at 5PM where I had a nice view of the kitchen where activity was bustling behind he coffee beakers with the broth at full boil and the pork and duck chashu being meticulously sliced. I was sitting with a Filipino family who could barely contain their enthusiasm over the forthcoming noodlefest.\n\nI was feeling the same way and knew what to order since I had well over an hour to decide. I started with their one and only appetizer, the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. There were four of them completely shelled and marinated (photo: http://bit.ly/1Vp0sEV). Tasty freshness gone too soon, but the main event was about to occur. It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls. I was timid and just had a $4.75 bottle of Sapporo Premium to wash it all down (photo: http://bit.ly/1RTN9dq), but they have pricier Japanese artisan beers which they strongly recommended to me for the next time. And there will be a next time even as I saw the line go down the block as I departed.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...best paitan ramen broth ever, period\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...clean, white and you only wish it was triple the size to make the line move faster\nSERVICE - 5 stars...lovely people work here\nTOTAL - 5 stars...not just for self-proclaimed ramen connoisseurs...be patient or come near closing", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-04-04"}, {"excerpts": ["So the four categories are: tori paitan (most ordered based on pictures and reviews), shoyu (what I ordered), shio, and vegan tantanmen.\n\n"], "author": "Catherine W.", "review": "The short: organic shoyu ramen hits the spot\n\nIf you're not one of the first in line, be prepared to wait about an hour. This place seats about 30 people max, with 2 very long tables, and some seats facing the kitchen. Also be prepared for sitting at a communal table. Some people don't like this...? I don't mind, as long as I have elbow room and have good food!\n\nWhile in line, we checked out the menu and had a face palm moment when I realized that the description described the items below. Basically, the items below the header start with the basic bowl, and increase in price for additional items. So the four categories are: tori paitan (most ordered based on pictures and reviews), shoyu (what I ordered), shio, and vegan tantanmen.\n\nWhen the shoyu ramen arrived, I quickly dug in because I was so hungry. The duck chasu and pork chasu was tender, perfectly cooked, and enhanced the broth (wishing there were doubles of each!). Even the kale was an unusual, but nice addition. The broth was perfect, not salty or oily. And the noodles were chewy! At first, it doesn't look like there's a lot of noodles, but the bowl is shaped quite deeply at the bottom, so all the noodles are hidden there. There was so much I liked about this ramen. \n\nI couldn't figure out what the seasonings on the table were, though there was pink himalayan salt, and maybe some other seasonings to personally enhance the broth to the right taste. I didn't need to as I liked it the way it was.\n\nThe waiter was very kind and smiling, which is something I don't see too often. All the seating is on stools, and there are baskets on the ground for bags. The whole inside has a clean and modern aesthetic, with a living wall at the entrance, descriptions of the different types of ramen, and a view into the kitchen.

Ok, not just \"toast\" but phuckin' bougie, tweezified toast. \n\nThis year, it's $15 coffee (for one cup!) and $18 ramen.\n\nBecause, San Francisco! \n\nNext year, I'm bracing myself for $100 pizza. Oh wait, we already had that during the super bowl (well, I didn't but it was available at Tony's Pizza Napoletana). \n\nSeriously, what's next? \n\nKindly let me know so I can start harvesting my eggs to sell! \n\n$18 ramen may sound crazy but people waited 3+ hours for this ramen on opening night! \n\n$18 for a taste of Tokyo? Why not! \n\nMensho's first U.S. location is one of the most, if not the most highly anticipated restaurant opening this year in SF! \n\nTip: Come at 4 pm (earlier on the weekends) or after 10 pm to avoid long wait times. \n\nCurrently, Mensho has 4 ramen options available ($9-$18) with a single or double chashu option. When the owner returns from Japan in March, their menu will expand. No housemade noodles yet. They have a noodle machine but are awaiting permit(s) to use it (same for the tonkotsu equipment). Disappointingly no marinated soft boiled egg is available but maybe in the future? Beer only; no sake, soda, or juice.\n\nMy friend and I ordered three bowls of ramen to share:\n\n(1) Tori Paitan: Rich, creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce | double chashu $18\nhttp://bit.ly/1XrzETT\n\nOur favorite of the three, the kotteri broth was deliciously creamy (gravy-like) and richly satisfying. It had great depth of umami flavor but did get a bit gritty mid-way. The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of). I tried Nojo's last night and there's absolutely no comparison. Mensho's is infinitely superior. \n\n(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\nhttp://bit.ly/1QfmuKm\n\nA much lighter assari broth but saltier with a slight sweetness since it's a soy sauce based. The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast. He was uber nice and offered to answer any questions I had. Really cool guy! \n\nThe space is small and only seats 28 - two communal tables and four seats at the counter. We choose to sit at the counter. There's more privacy (if you're on a date) and you can watch the chefs in action.\n\nRead all signs before parking. Do NOT park on Geary from 4-6 pm (tow-away zone) on the weekdays, otherwise your $18 bowl of ramen will turn into a $618+ bowl of ramen. \n\nBecause, San Francisco!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Vegan Tantanmen - http://tinyurl.com/h29wb6x\n"], "author": "Lily L.", "review": "Unique and delicious ramen that is well worth the wait.

I liked the ramen here so much that I came back again the next day. \n\nTori Paitan - http://tinyurl.com/zmhmezu\nAmazingly thick and rich broth that has a strong chicken flavor. The first couple bites of this ramen is just heavenly. Then the richness gets to be a bit too much after a while. I could barely finish my bowl! The ramen came with two thin slices of pork chashu and duck chashu. The pork slices were very tender and the duck was cooked closer to medium than well - which is unusual for asian cuisine. The main flavor in both types of meat was the meat itself, not the typical chashu flavor. The burdock roots were thinly crispy and thinly sliced, which really added to the texture of the whole dish. The noodles were thick and average in terms of taste. I really liked this ramen as a whole. I felt kind of bad after finishing it because it was overwhelmingly rich and fatty. \n\nVegan Tantanmen - http://tinyurl.com/h29wb6x\nOverall, I liked this ramen more than the Tori Paitan. It still had a rich broth, but not so overwhelmingly rich that it made me feel bad after finishing it. The broth tasted like a combination of peanuts and sesame. There were a couple drops of spicy chili oil in the soup was only slightly spicy.\n\nOysters in Dare Shoyu Sauce - http://tinyurl.com/ztsb6kt\nThis is the only appetizer here. I don't eat oysters often and I've never had it cooked so this was a completely new dish to me. The order came with 6 pieces of oysters even though the menu says it's supposed to be 3 pieces. The oysters were well braised and topped with chives. (The 2nd time I came back, I saw an order of oysters topped with sprouts instead of chives so they probably change up the toppings). Taste wise, it kind of reminded me of chicken gizzard or heart. I wasn't super in love with this dish but I'm pretty sure that's just because I'm not a huge fan of oysters.\n\nYou can ask for a side of chili oil if you want to add some spice to your ramen.

The broth was VERY creamy and rich, almost like a sauce instead of a broth. If tonkotsu had a creamier poultry-based broth cousin, it would be this. You could definitely taste the katsuo in the broth, which I normally don't like but it was okay here. The slices of duck were SO tender, it was quite amazing.

You want a tip on when to come? Probably even at weird times, the line is better but it's still long. We came on a Thursday night around 9:15p. Maybe it was because of the NBA finals, with a game that just recently ended and people still at the bar, or maybe it was just because we caught the lull in between the dinner rush and the late dinner crowd. We ended up waiting for about 20 minutes. I would also recommend you come in a smaller group of like 2 people. You are likely to get seated faster with a small party because the shop is very small. Bigger parties just have to wait for more tables to open up. \n\nOk, on to the ramen. You want to know if it's worth the wait? I don't think any food is really worth a two-hour wait, so that's where I'm coming from. But it is very good ramen. We got three bowls to share between the two of us so that we could try more things.  My friend who had been there before said that her favorite is vegan tantanmen, and we are both partial to spicy ramen. However, they ran out by the time we got there. At least that's what our server said - but I think she must have gotten false information from the kitchen.  The dude next to us who came after got a bowl, which made us very sad. Note that if you get more food than you can eat, they do NOT do to-go orders. Meaning they won't give you a to-go box. I'm not sure I like this policy. You shouldn't make delicious food and then not let people bring it home with them to enjoy if they can't finish it all. I will also say that I still like Ramen Dojo better than this place because I'm partial to spicy broth and they didn't have the spicy one when we were here. \n\nSo here are the bowls of ramen we tried: \n\n(1) Tori Paitan: I think this is their specialty. I don't really like chicken broth ramen, but this place has the best chicken ramen I've ever had. The broth is frothy and creamy and satisfying. Also the noodles here are some of the best ramen noodles I've ever had. They're thicker than normal and really yummy. Still, I love spicy ramen and this was delicious but a little too bland for me. The toppings are good too - duck chashu and pork chashu are both yummy. \n\n(2) Shoyu: If you like shoyu ramen, this is probably the best one I've ever had. If you like lighter broths this is the one for you. I'm not as big a fan of lighter broths, but I could tell this ramen was done really well. The noodles are really good in this one too, still chewy but a little thinner than the ones that come in the tori paitan. \n\n(3) Spicy Mazesoba: Originally, we were going to get the vegan tantanmen as our third bowl but they ran out. Then we wanted to get the tsukemen, but they said they run out at 7p. So we decided on the spicy mazesoba. I have never had this before, so I had no idea what it is. Basically, it's like noodles with sauce but no soup. It comes in a bowl (see attached pic) with an egg yolk and various toppings. Note that the spicy one also comes with a side of what I think are habanero peppers, but not super sure. We thought these were carrots and put the entire thing in - it was wayyyyy too spicy this way - like wasabi style spicy. Do not do what we did! I think this noodle dish would have been really yummy to try and share if we didn't accidentally make it so darn spicy, it came with thick and chewy delicious noodles. Good alternative to the soup ramens, and interesting to try if you come with a group. \n\nAll in all, I'd give this place five stars for the food. But docking it one star because of the to-go policy and because they didn't explain how to eat the mazesoba to us. It's not really intuitive! Just don't go in expecting great service either because it's a little too crowded and busy to give great service. \n\nI will definitely be back to try to get my hands on bowls of tsukemen and the vegan tantanmen!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["The vegan tantanmen was so delicious.

There were 3 separate benches: one long bench that fits 12, two short bench that fit 6 each, and 4 chairs near the chef window. The place was definitely small but very clean and simple.

If you're like me and the thought of ever leaving downtown is off the table you've just kind of accepted that you'll never have ramen quite as good as you would in Tokyo or even Los Angeles.\n\nAnd then, Mensho Tokyo opened its doors. Since that day it's been really clear that the inhabitants of San Francisco are suffering from a severe ramen shortage because the lines to eat at this tiny place haven't let up. Part of the reason is that there are only around twenty spots to eat in this place but still, I would have expected the demand to let up a bit after a few months; your best bet is to show up around 4:30pm before the restaurant opens if you want to be seated in less than an hour.\n\nThere is good reason for the demand: the ramen is unquestionably the best in the city.

Everything was perfect, from the al dente noodles, to the level of spice in the broth. There's no way you could tell it's vegan, and the broth had a great earthy, nutty flavor.

We came here around 7:15pm and stood about 5 feet from the Alcatraz theatre sign. A waitress came to take down our name, and we asked how long the wait was. She said from the sign, it would be about an hour. We decided to wait, but her estimate was far from what the actual wait turned out to be. It took us almost an hour to get to the sign, and in total, we waited 2.5 hours. \n\nWhat turned my friends off the most was the service. Their seating system is the most inefficient that we have ever seen. It was baffling. Granted, our party is on the bigger side, and there are only 4 tables and a bar to sit at so approximately 35 seats in the restaurant. Their seating system really puts people with more than 2 or 3 people at a disadvantage because they won't seat you unless a party with the same number of people leaves. Once we reached the front and there were only 2 more parties in front of us, the waitress told us that we would take the table of the group of 5 that just sat down even though there was a group of 3 that was leaving. We asked if we could split up because the people next to the group of 3 on their way out would probably finish within 15 minutes. She said no because then the time of serving the food to our party would be  vary and that's not allowed. We were so confused as to why that should be a problem if we were okay with it. And if that were really a problem, since the party next to the group of 3 was close to done, it would have been practical for her to save those three seats until the other party finished so that we would all be seated at the same time. Instead, she gave it to another party behind us and multiple parties behind us went before we even got in. In total, it was a 2.5 hour wait. By the end of the wait, we were fuming at the inefficiency because it was extremely unfair that we couldn't be seated even if we agreed to split up. As we were making our way out, the same waitress, an older woman who seemed to be the manager, stopped my friend and yelled at her for not giving enough tip and demanded more. We were all in shock because we have never been put in a situation like this before. My friend said no because she explained her to how she thought the seating system was inefficient and the wait wasn't worth it. The lady then proceeded to tell her, \"If you don't want to wait, don't come back.\" We waited because we thought it would only be an hour because that's what we were told, and a lot of people would be seated faster and the line would move faster had their system been more efficient. She has our WORD that we will not be returning. \n\nFinally, onto the food. I ordered the chicken paitan ramen because that's what everyone was raving about. Upon being seated, they took our order pretty quickly and the food came pretty fast (~10-15min). Upon tasting the soup, my friends and I looked at each other with furrowed eyebrows, and said, \"it's so salty.\" This was not just the case with the chicken paitan, but my friend who had the vegan tantanmen also said hers was really salty too. You could definitely tell that the chicken broth was cooked for a long time because the natural flavors of the chicken were prominent, but I thought the broth was too heavy, salty and creamy in a bad way. I drank SO much water while eating the bowl of ramen, and 3 hours later, I'm still thirsty and my mouth is super dry. I appreciated the innovation of incorporating different ingredients that aren't traditionally seen in ramen such as kale. I am willing to accept kale because it offered a change in texture within the different types of vegetables, but I was NOT a fan of the duck. I thought that having a chicken broth with pork and duck chashu was WAY too much. 3 different types of meat in one dish and it felt like all the flavors were clashing. I liked the pork chashu though; it just melted in your mouth. The noodles were also cooked al dente and chewy. My friends and I were disappointed that there wasn't even a soft boiled egg in a bowl of ramen that costed $18. There were a lot of noodles and I was full, but I definitely will not be back.", "rating": 1, "date": "2016-04-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Unbelievable Vegan Tantanmen. ", "Expect long lines.

After 15 minutes, we didn't move forward too much, mostly because ppl lining in front of us had friends joining them - one person even had 5 people joining him! I would like to think restaurants line their customers up not just to give themselves good advertisement but also to help people decide if they are dining there based on the length of the line. Allowing too many people to cut into the line because they have sent a friend waiting does a disservice for that purpose. If the restaurant lets people line up before the whole group is there, It is better to also keep a written waiting list of names with the number in each party, so that people would not have the wrong expectation regarding the waiting time. \n\nI also noticed that mensho does not seem to seat smaller groups first. They left 4 empty seats open for sometime until 2 more people at that table left so that they can accommodate the 6-ppl group. To be honest, that's a nice thing for the restaurant to do, and I would prefer going to that kind of restaurant when I have a larger party.

Unfortunately Mensho has stolen Ippudo's spotlight and is seriously the best ramen that I've ever had.\n\nHad an impromptu day with some friends in the city and kinda winged it as to where to get food. My friend was browsing through Yelp for awhile and he picked very wisely. He asked if we were down for some ramen and off we went. Luckily when we got there, the line was starting to form so it wasn't too bad. We got in line while my friend tried to find parking. We waited in line for about 1.5 hour which honestly isn't that bad since Mensho is pretty small inside. So keep in mind it's not friendly for groups.

Finally we got seated by this counter seating which was fine. We got to see the chefs in action and it was interesting to see the process of it all.

There was enough pieces for the 3 of us to try and to hold off our appetite as we patiently waited for our ramen.\n\nOnce our ramen had arrived, we tried each other's broths. The ones that my friends ordered had a creamy broth and it was so savory and delicious. My broth was lighter but still delicious. At first when I tried the broth for my ramen, it had a strong seafood taste but after mixing that whipped butter and all the other ingredients in my bowl together, there was a huge shift in the taste of my broth. It was much more flavorful and that strong seafood taste was masked...probably by the butter but I'm not complaining. The noodles in my ramen were a bit different from my friends but they were so fresh and tasty. So delicious!\n\nThe service was alright. Had to flag down a server a few times to get more water.

It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls. I was timid and just had a $4.75 bottle of Sapporo Premium to wash it all down (photo: http://bit.ly/1RTN9dq), but they have pricier Japanese artisan beers which they strongly recommended to me for the next time. And there will be a next time even as I saw the line go down the block as I departed.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...best paitan ramen broth ever, period\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...clean, white and you only wish it was triple the size to make the line move faster\nSERVICE - 5 stars...lovely people work here\nTOTAL - 5 stars...not just for self-proclaimed ramen connoisseurs...be patient or come near closing", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-04-04"}, {"excerpts": ["OYSTERS IN SHOYU DARE OIL - 4 for $5.

That's impossible right? Well, I'm not easy to please in terms of ramen, but the fact that I actually drank the entire chicken broth is saying something! The restaurant opens at 5pm, but a huge line already started forming before it even opened. My friends got a spot in line at about 4:45pm, and I met up with them 30 minutes later. Total wait for us was about 1.5 hours, but I heard people have waited at least 2 hours for this. There is no sign up sheet for waiting, just an old fashioned wait your turn in line kinda deal. There's also not a lot of seating inside, so the wait makes more sense. Once you're inside, you still have to wait about 30 minutes from being seated to having your ramen come out.\n\nTIP: If you're comfortable and brave enough to eat alone, single seats are most likely available for you to skip the line if there are groups with odd numbers.\n\nParking in this area is kind of difficult, especially with all the one way streets and meter parking.

Parking is free and allowed at 6pm along this part of Geary. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple too, with your choice of Ramen, Tsukemen, and Mazesoba. The most popular one is the Tori Paitan Ramen, but I hear the Tsukemen is bomb as well (chilled ramen separated from the broth). There's not too many choices for additional toppings like soft boiled eggs or corn, but hey if the ramen tastes amazing by itself, who needs it? Just kidding I still want my soft boiled egg and corn.\n\nWe ordered oysters in shoyu dare oil for appetizers, and it was tasty. 4-5 pieces for $5 so not a bad deal. Once my Tori Paitan Double Chashu ($18) came out, I just stared at my ramen for a good 10 seconds. IT LOOKS SO GOOD. Okay looks are one thing, but let's taste the broth. DROOLS. A rich, thick, & creamy broth packed with a lot of flavor. It doesn't taste overly saturated with sodium at all. Double Chashu is so worth.

Even then, we waited for at least another hour and 15 minutes until we were finally seated. At reaching the top of the line, there was still a good thirty people behind us. \n\nThere is no wait list to put your name down or reservations. You do it the good old fashioned stand and wait your turn. Finding parking in this area can be a hassle but there is parking across the street that is free and available after 6pm assuming you can snag the spot (it is a no stopping zone before 6pm). The restaurant is quite small and there's two rows of tables. The front row was one long table and the back row near the windows was sectioned off into two separate tables. It's communal seating so you may be sitting with other parties if you are a small group. I was sitting in the back row near the windows and our table seated 7 so our party of 3 was seated with two other parties of 2.

They're really tiny pieces and the Yelp photos are a lie when you see the close-up and think it's bigger than it really is (so sorry, my photo is now a lie).

I would love to return here once they have some more of what I consider necessary side staples such as karaage or takowasa. \n\nFirst, we had the tori paitan with extra chashu. The broth is very hearty and fatty (creamy taste always equals high fat content). The ramen was firm and held up well. However, where was my ajitsuke tamari!? This is Japanese for soft boiled egg and I am not sure why they don't also serve this as an option. My guess is this will be added later but it was sorely missed.\n\nSecond, we had shoyu ramen.

The broth started off tasting light and delicious, but over time the taste of raw seafood (\"like the ocean\") permeated the entire bowl.  My boyfriend noted the noodles were not hot as in the Tori Paitain; perhaps that was to prevent overcooking of the clams and scallops in the dish?  I was expecting the broth to taste a little more \"cooked,\" so I would not recommend this dish if you are adverse to an overly \"raw\" seafood taste.\n\nThe Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil were similarly raw tasting; I love oysters, but from the pictures I did not expect it to taste this much like the ocean.

A two-plus-hour wait for an $18 bowl of ramen sounds like a Louis C.K. joke about San Francisco millennials with no punchline. I got exhausted thinking about the hoops I'd have to jump through to get a taste of the broth here. However, now that at least six weeks have elapsed since the grand opening in February, I had an opening that I couldn't bypass, the Thursday before Good Friday when I got off work early.\n\nEveryone says to be there at 4PM even though they don't open until an hour later, and so I did. If you don't count the screeching homeless woman who kept sauntering by, no one else showed up until around 4:35PM. That's not to say the staff was indifferent to my presence as they thanked me for coming and waiting patiently. Eventually a line did start to form and rather quickly. I got seated at the front counter promptly at 5PM where I had a nice view of the kitchen where activity was bustling behind he coffee beakers with the broth at full boil and the pork and duck chashu being meticulously sliced. I was sitting with a Filipino family who could barely contain their enthusiasm over the forthcoming noodlefest.\n\nI was feeling the same way and knew what to order since I had well over an hour to decide. I started with their one and only appetizer, the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. There were four of them completely shelled and marinated (photo: http://bit.ly/1Vp0sEV). Tasty freshness gone too soon, but the main event was about to occur. It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls.

Ok, not just \"toast\" but phuckin' bougie, tweezified toast. \n\nThis year, it's $15 coffee (for one cup!) and $18 ramen.\n\nBecause, San Francisco! \n\nNext year, I'm bracing myself for $100 pizza. Oh wait, we already had that during the super bowl (well, I didn't but it was available at Tony's Pizza Napoletana). \n\nSeriously, what's next? \n\nKindly let me know so I can start harvesting my eggs to sell! \n\n$18 ramen may sound crazy but people waited 3+ hours for this ramen on opening night! \n\n$18 for a taste of Tokyo? Why not! \n\nMensho's first U.S. location is one of the most, if not the most highly anticipated restaurant opening this year in SF! \n\nTip: Come at 4 pm (earlier on the weekends) or after 10 pm to avoid long wait times. \n\nCurrently, Mensho has 4 ramen options available ($9-$18) with a single or double chashu option. When the owner returns from Japan in March, their menu will expand. No housemade noodles yet. They have a noodle machine but are awaiting permit(s) to use it (same for the tonkotsu equipment). Disappointingly no marinated soft boiled egg is available but maybe in the future? Beer only; no sake, soda, or juice.\n\nMy friend and I ordered three bowls of ramen to share:\n\n(1) Tori Paitan: Rich, creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce | double chashu $18\nhttp://bit.ly/1XrzETT\n\nOur favorite of the three, the kotteri broth was deliciously creamy (gravy-like) and richly satisfying. It had great depth of umami flavor but did get a bit gritty mid-way. The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of). I tried Nojo's last night and there's absolutely no comparison. Mensho's is infinitely superior. \n\n(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\nhttp://bit.ly/1QfmuKm\n\nA much lighter assari broth but saltier with a slight sweetness since it's a soy sauce based. The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast. He was uber nice and offered to answer any questions I had. Really cool guy! \n\nThe space is small and only seats 28 - two communal tables and four seats at the counter. We choose to sit at the counter. There's more privacy (if you're on a date) and you can watch the chefs in action.\n\nRead all signs before parking. Do NOT park on Geary from 4-6 pm (tow-away zone) on the weekdays, otherwise your $18 bowl of ramen will turn into a $618+ bowl of ramen. \n\nBecause, San Francisco!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Sansho Beer: ", "B+.\n", "Yes, I did order that $11.75/11.5oz beer.

In fact, we kept alternating between the two because each one seemed to make the other one taste awesomer and each was awesome by itself.\n- The oysters!  These had \"shiyo oil\" on them, which gave me flashback to the first time I had truffle oil: the first bite is a bit \"unusual\" or foreign, the second bite affirms that this foreign taste is actually good and fits in with other savory aromatic foods, and by the third bite you are ready to pay double the price just to have a little more.
