I would eat dinner here and sit down next time.\n\nI'm gonna go there, you know that Adam Sandler movie, \"Eight Nights of Hanukkah\" ? Well Jews really do link with the Chinese, this shop is a GEM in what some may call an historical part of town in San Francisco. Heard of Chinatown? Idk me either. Just got these cool looking Oriental buildings in the heart of SF, Bush and Grant, says it on your Yelp! I just learned it now too, right by the Dragon Gates. \n\nIt's enough just to be here, in SF, but the aesthetic in & around the restaurant very proper & fitting. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give this place a shot despite the walk up the stairs, have you seen the hills in SF!?? Or is Uber taking over your life!!!  Yeah I know SF is all San Tech now but...\n\nThere is an Old World sense & taste in and around Sabra Grill. Consider getting there by foot, going down the Silk Road from East to West.\n\nWalk through Union Square due East, & after you pass under the towering skyscrapers of Downtown down Bush or Grant, go under the Dragon Gates and step no further than 13 steps. There you'll find the Middle Eastern Sabra Grill, right there at the head of Chinatown. You go from West to East in seconds, but Sabra Grill is that blend of both.\n\nMake a (slight) Ascent up the stairs to the Middle East , into a tight space of what looks like MOST Middle Eastern food stops I've seen myself. Nothing cute and that's the style I'm used to in the OG places, it felt like I was tucked in a corner of Jerusalem or my dad's town of Akko. The Walls have pictures of Israel, Scripture on the walls in Hebrew, maps of Israel, & if seeing the guy in a Kippah/Yamukkah wasn't enough to know I was gonna eat Kosher food, I was at peace with the man's clear appreciation for his culture and history. The place had no shame in who it was.\n\nI felt at home inside, I didn't expect anything more or less than what I saw. Do you know how hard it is JUST TO RUN A RESTAURANT!! Kosher Certification is a a big merit and meticulous task of maintaining food standards for the Jewish community! Anybody who takes that task is faced with daily scrutiny of his practices, because for the people who need it, it matters that much. It's just as important as gluten free and Halal and vegetarian! BIG props to the big guy behind the counter who works very hard & looks like my dad!!! I never seen a huger smile on my face when I asked to take a picture of them together. In fact it's the only picture I took and not even the food because we scarfed it down!! \n\nI wish I got his name because I would tell you tell him, Matan sent you, the kid who took his picture with the big Jew bear looking guy! Just show him my picture I post!! SF you gotta go give this guy more reviews and I promise you won't be let down!!!\n\nThank you for letting me feel at home sir!

And, after trying several places nearby, without a doubt the best Falafel in a several block radius.\n\nWhat I really like about them, is that the Falafel are always fried fresh, and are nice and hot and crispy when you bite into them.  Another unique thing they have is their pita bread.  It's thicker than any other pita bread I have ever been served (probably at least twice as thick, and it has air bubbles inside like you'd find in an English Muffin, only it's much thinner than that).  As a result, the pita is always very pliable, tasty, and chewy.  Best yet, it's always served warm.  The Falafel Pita is $9.95, and totally worth it; especially when compared to the Falafel served at the other restaurants nearby.\n\nMost places in San Francisco use a much thinner pita, almost all serve it cold, and when it's served dry it just crumbles into a mess, and the ingredients fall out on to your plate.\n\nA real treat here is the Lamb Shishlik.  Again, each skewer is grilled to order.  Without a doubt some of the very best tasting Lamb Shishlik I have ever had.  It's delicious.\n\nThe only major miss so far that I have eaten here is the Chicken & Onion Shawarma.  To me, it just tasted awful.  I think it might have something to do with being cooked on the same grill as the Lamb.\n\nOther than that, everything I have tried has been real good, and worth eating again.  The humus and the rice are also good.\n\nA lot of people complain about the prices here.  Yes, it's more expensive because everything has to be certified as being Kosher.  However, if you stick to the lunch specials that they have posted next to the entrance on the street (which run from 12pm to 4pm), the prices are pretty fair for the flavor of the food they serve (around $10-$16 for lunch without drinks).\n\nSince they are Jewish, it's closed on Saturday; but, open on Sundays. If you weren't specifically looking for it, you would easily miss the entrance on the street level.  If you start at the Chinatown Gate at Grant and Bush, it's about 50 feet up Grant Street on the left hand side (West Side of Grant St).

"], "author": "Tamar F.", "review": "I hate to hate on my fellow tribe members, but man is this place a big letdown.  In my summer in the Bay Area, I never once visited the \"only kosher restaurant in San Francisco.\"  Nope, it was kosher meat from Trader Joe's for me.  And yes, I passed this many a time, but just never had the urge to step foot in the restaurant.  \n\nHowever, when I had to go up to San Fran for work this week, I was meeting a friend with food allergies who suggested this place (since it would be guaranteed to not have any dairy products).  Okay, Israeli kosher food, I can deal.\n\nSabra is located at the edge of Chinatown and you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get there.  The ambiance is non-existent.  I've been to my fair share of zero-ambiance kosher restaurants, a result of having family in many Orthodox neighborhoods where \"kidproofing\" a restaurant is a much better investment than decor, but this seemed even worse.  It felt like I was in seminary at one of those Beit Midrashes (i.e. study hall at Yeshiva).  The tablecloths seemed jaded, and were covered in outdated Israel postcards with a layer of glass on top.  The artwork on the walls was a mish-mosh of Judaica.  And there were laminated numbers denoting the tables, which had metal-backed chairs that I only regularly see when I go to a shtiebel for High Holidays.  (Finally, a Yelp review where I can put my yiddish lingo to good use.)\n\nOkay, so we go up the stairs and sit down at one of the tables.  We get our menus.  Sandwiches are only for lunch or to-go, which was a bummer since this would have been a great option.  Oh well.  But a kebab?  Over $20!  Are you friggin' kidding me?  I go to my kosher meat market in West LA all the time, and a grilled-to-order kebab is $6 or less.  And even that has more ambiance than this place, so I can't say that I'm paying for atmosphere, as I may at an upscale locale.  \n\nSo we go through the menu.  Our third dining companion has a strong allergy to wheat, and couldn't have anything touching flour.  I know what you're thinking - one kosher gal, another allergic to dairy, and another flour.  It's like a joke waiting to happen, but given the menu, this place should have been quite accommodating - especially since they weren't serving sandwiches.\n\nThe waiter (dressed in a dirty tee and jeans) came to take our order.  I opted for the Shakshukah, which is an Israeli egg dish.  Oh wait, they're out of that.  Darnit.  Okay, I have to look back at the menu, since I refuse to spend $20 on a dish here.  The girl with the flour allergy orders an omelet, but asked not to be served the accompanying fries because she's hella allergic.  And stated and restated this at least five times to the dude.  No pita, no fries - kapiche?  The third one got schnitzel.\n\nSo then it's back on me to order.  I opt for the Shawarma, even though I think it's a ripoff.  But wait - waiter says - they don't actually cook this the way you do shawarma - on a rotating grill like a gyro.  No, this is just sauteed chicken.  WTF?!?!  Then don't call it shawarma.  Heck no, I ain't getting sauteed chicken - what is that even?  So I cave and order Melawach, which is a flaky Yemenite pastry I usually cook at home for under 50 cents a pop.  \n\nAs we order he asks if we'd like to start with an order of hummus and although it's also overpriced ($8) we say okay.  \n\nThe hummus never came.  The omelet came covered in the fries, despite that the diner belabored the point.  When she pointed this out to the waiter (who was the only guy covering the dining area), he just looked at her and was like \"is this really such a big deal?\" and returned with a plate to put the fries on... even though she explained that now she'd have to cut away all of the parts touching the fries.  The melawach was okay - it came with unseasoned minced tomatoes, though it traditionally also includes an egg of sorts which was missing.  So not worth the money.\n\nAnd then we get the check, a good 20 minutes after we asked.  Oh wait, they charged us for our nonexistent hummus.  Of course, we wouldn't known that had I not been able to read Hebrew, since that's what our order was written in with no English line-items.  I pointed this out and the waiter reluctantly removed the item.\n\nSo $45 for an omelet, a pastry topped in tomato, and a chicken cutlet.  In a place less comfortable than eating at a cubicle and with a rude waiter.  I've dealt with expensive restaurants (that are usually worth it), rude waitstaff, and unwelcoming restaurants.  But with that trifecta and mediocre (at best) food, the only reason I can see why this place is in business is because it's the. only. kosher. restaurant. in. San.
