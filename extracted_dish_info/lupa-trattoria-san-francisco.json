My wife and I joined some friends here for dinner a couple nights ago and we were astonished at the quality of the food, the amazing (but somewhat rare) combination of friendliness and service offered by our waiter, and our overall experience here.\n\nWe ordered what turned out to be way too much food (but were glad we did) and we ordered strategically so that we could share and try more things (also glad we did!).\n\nBetween the four of us, we ordered:\n\n. scamorza ai funghi (amazing melted cheese and sauted mushrooms in a ramekin - so delicious!)\n. insalata di spinaci (typical but excellent spinach salad)\n. gnocchi al cinghiale (regular potato gnocchi (vs. ricotta gnocci below), great texture, delicious sauce)\n. ravioli di zucca (not at all too sweet, as butternut squash ravioli sometimes tends to be)\n. saltimbocca alla romana (perfectly cooked)\n. a breaded sole filet from the daily special menu\n. homemade ricotta gnocchi with italian sausage, also from the daily specials (super soft gnocchi in an outstanding sauce)\n. for dessert, we all shared one panna cotta with fresh berry coulis (amazing texture -- I've never been a huge fan of panna cotta but am now a convert, at least as far as this one is concerned)\n. various espressos and teas along with our dessert\n\nWith dinner we had a chianti that the waiter recommended, and we all agreed that it was exceedingly delicious and amazingly went with all of our food.\n\nI unfortunately don't have enough time right now to describe each individual dish, which I know would ultimately make this a more useful review, but everything was excellent.  The one exception to this was the sole filet, which was still better than average, but is not something that I would write to mom about (although apparently I will write to the Yelp community about it).   Besides this, though, the flavors were full and rich.  Maybe a bit salty, but I seem to think the same thing about EVERY restaurant, so it's gotta be me, not the place.   \n\nAnyway, I just checked and their website has their menu complete with fairly meaningful descriptions of the dishes so you can get more info on the dishes there.\n\nWe loved our waiter because he was friendly and attentive, and also not afraid to make suggestions when asked.  My wife, Karen, asked which of two main courses was better and the waiter unhesitatingly recommended one over the other (I can't remember which things), and although we didn't try the one he guided us away from, the one she chose was delicious.  Our waiter (whose name I never got) made our experience more fun by occasionally good-humoredly joking with us.  Never annoying or over the top, just low-key and fun.  \n\nWe hadn't seen our friends in a long time, so we ended up lingering a bit longer than we would have otherwise, and on this particular Saturday night, although the place was packed the whole time, we didn't seem to be keeping any hungry customers from getting a table, so they let us linger as long as we wanted to, and kept cheerfully refilling our water glasses until we left.\n\nUltimately, when it came time for the bill, I actually gave a 30% tip.  I don't usually get so hardcore on tipping like that, but I'm also not very often that impressed with the excellent combination of factors that led us to have a spectacular time.  My only concern now is that next time I go back they'll have an extremely high bar to live up to!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWent back again on Saturday night, and this place kicked a** again.

He actually watches what's going on and times his appearances accordingly.  We were dining with friends who we hadn't seen for a long time and who had just gotten engaged.  So lots of lively chatting going on at our table.  \n\nBecause I happened to be facing in the right direction, I noticed that Stefano always waited until just the right time to show up (waiting for a pause in the flow of conversation), never interrupting us except to bring the food that we had ordered (delicious as always, so much so that our avid cyclist friends even ate the fatty melted cheese dish!).  Stefano's careful consideration to the timing of his appearances was so well executed, though, that I don't think my dinner companions noticed -- they just enjoyed themselves.

The one exception to this was the sole filet, which was still better than average, but is not something that I would write to mom about (although apparently I will write to the Yelp community about it).   Besides this, though, the flavors were full and rich.  Maybe a bit salty, but I seem to think the same thing about EVERY restaurant, so it's gotta be me, not the place.   \n\nAnyway, I just checked and their website has their menu complete with fairly meaningful descriptions of the dishes so you can get more info on the dishes there.\n\nWe loved our waiter because he was friendly and attentive, and also not afraid to make suggestions when asked.  My wife, Karen, asked which of two main courses was better and the waiter unhesitatingly recommended one over the other (I can't remember which things), and although we didn't try the one he guided us away from, the one she chose was delicious.  Our waiter (whose name I never got) made our experience more fun by occasionally good-humoredly joking with us.  Never annoying or over the top, just low-key and fun.  \n\nWe hadn't seen our friends in a long time, so we ended up lingering a bit longer than we would have otherwise, and on this particular Saturday night, although the place was packed the whole time, we didn't seem to be keeping any hungry customers from getting a table, so they let us linger as long as we wanted to, and kept cheerfully refilling our water glasses until we left.\n\nUltimately, when it came time for the bill, I actually gave a 30% tip.  I don't usually get so hardcore on tipping like that, but I'm also not very often that impressed with the excellent combination of factors that led us to have a spectacular time.  My only concern now is that next time I go back they'll have an extremely high bar to live up to!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWent back again on Saturday night, and this place kicked a** again.  I definitely still give this place two thumbs up, and I'd give it more thumbs if I had more thumbs.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOK, so updating my review for a third time is bordering on being either like a psycho Yelp! stalker or a Lupa brown-noser.  But I just can't help myself.  We went back here again with new friends, and 1) I discovered that our favorite waiter's name is Stefano and 2) I realized why he makes our experiences here amazing.  He actually watches what's going on and times his appearances accordingly.  We were dining with friends who we hadn't seen for a long time and who had just gotten engaged.  So lots of lively chatting going on at our table.  \n\nBecause I happened to be facing in the right direction, I noticed that Stefano always waited until just the right time to show up (waiting for a pause in the flow of conversation), never interrupting us except to bring the food that we had ordered (delicious as always, so much so that our avid cyclist friends even ate the fatty melted cheese dish!).  Stefano's careful consideration to the timing of his appearances was so well executed, though, that I don't think my dinner companions noticed -- they just enjoyed themselves.

One of the many advantages of a good neighborhood Italian spot--top tier food without the heat and hassle. We showed up a little bit late, but were shown to our table right away. The space was lovely, unassumingly appointed, with a vibrant, cozy ambiance. Busy, with tables close to each other, but in a good, cozy kind of way. I spied pretty shamelessly on our neighbors' pasta. Service was great, warm and professional. We had red wine by the glass--a primitivo and a falco rosso, I think were the designations--and enjoyed a wonderful meal.\n\nThe food was outstanding. We ordered the burrata and speck to start, and helped ourselves to the fresh bread in the basket. The burrata and speck were unimpeachable, great separately, and great together. There were three generous globs of milky burrata, and a nice sheaf of silky Tyrolean speck, over a bed of lightly dressed arugula. I ordered the bucatini amatriciana for my entree after ogling it so openly that I just went ahead and asked the guy at the next table if it was as delicious as it looked. He said that it was, and he was right. The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente, tossed with caramelized onion, pancetta, and Romano cheese in a tomato sauce.

The restaurant is cozy, quaint, and is a good place to come with friends, family, or a date.  \n\nWe started off with the Crostini Sampler (a special that night) and it was a hit.  The crostini was good and crusty and the high-quality mozzarella was warm, milky, and just chewy enough.  There were 3 varieties: sweet red bell pepper, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and prosciutto.  Of the three, the mushrooms had the most flavor, but I liked prosciutto the best.\n\nThe table got 3 pasta dishes to share family-style.  The special of the night was a Spaghetti di Mare-- mussels, clams, and shrimp in a light tomato-based sauce.  The Pappardelle Sugo d'Agnello featured homemade pappardelle in a lamb bolognese and the Fettuccine Tartufate served homemade fettuccine with porcini, shitake, and oyster mushrooms in a black truffle sauce.\n\nAll the homemade noodles were outstanding in texture and doneness-- ribbon thin and just the right amount of chew.  The pappardelle in lamb bolognese, in particular, was really great.  The fettuccine dish was bursting with a lot of mushroom and truffle flavor, but the dish became a bit too heavy and one-note after a while.  The seafood spaghetti was perhaps my least favorite-- the sauce was under-seasoned and the shellfish was overcooked. Would pass.\n\nService was spotty throughout, but overall, I enjoyed my wonderfully carb-y meal.

Our waiter (whose name I never got) made our experience more fun by occasionally good-humoredly joking with us.  Never annoying or over the top, just low-key and fun.  \n\nWe hadn't seen our friends in a long time, so we ended up lingering a bit longer than we would have otherwise, and on this particular Saturday night, although the place was packed the whole time, we didn't seem to be keeping any hungry customers from getting a table, so they let us linger as long as we wanted to, and kept cheerfully refilling our water glasses until we left.\n\nUltimately, when it came time for the bill, I actually gave a 30% tip.  I don't usually get so hardcore on tipping like that, but I'm also not very often that impressed with the excellent combination of factors that led us to have a spectacular time.  My only concern now is that next time I go back they'll have an extremely high bar to live up to!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWent back again on Saturday night, and this place kicked a** again.  I definitely still give this place two thumbs up, and I'd give it more thumbs if I had more thumbs.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOK, so updating my review for a third time is bordering on being either like a psycho Yelp! stalker or a Lupa brown-noser.  But I just can't help myself.  We went back here again with new friends, and 1) I discovered that our favorite waiter's name is Stefano and 2) I realized why he makes our experiences here amazing.  He actually watches what's going on and times his appearances accordingly.  We were dining with friends who we hadn't seen for a long time and who had just gotten engaged.  So lots of lively chatting going on at our table.  \n\nBecause I happened to be facing in the right direction, I noticed that Stefano always waited until just the right time to show up (waiting for a pause in the flow of conversation), never interrupting us except to bring the food that we had ordered (delicious as always, so much so that our avid cyclist friends even ate the fatty melted cheese dish!).  Stefano's careful consideration to the timing of his appearances was so well executed, though, that I don't think my dinner companions noticed -- they just enjoyed themselves.  His conscientious service really made our dinner wonderful, so much that I decided to risk my fellow Yelpers thinking that I'm a dope for updating my review a third time!", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-03-17"}], "filetto di maiale al vino rosso": [{"excerpts": ["We also ordered the Filetto di Maiale al Vino Rosso which was $19.50.

Lupa is a quaint and unassuming trattoria on 24th Street in Noe Valley with excellent service and very good food. \n\nBecause it was our first time there, we decided to order a lot of food so that we could sample many dishes and  flavors etc. \n\nDrinks: \nPeroni- beer (my favorite Italian beer--always psyched to see it offered on menus) \nMontepulciano d'Abruzzo- wine by the glass (hearty and tasty) \n\nAntipasto: \nWe split a very fresh and tasty spinach salad that was dressed with a light raspberry vinaigrette, walnuts and goat cheese. \n\nPrimo Piatto: \nWe split the Bucatini Amatriciana which was $15.00  It's a straw shaped hollow pasta (like a thick spaghetti noodle) with caramelized onion, pancetta and Romano cheese in a tomato sauce \nThis would have been enough for a main course. It was seasoned beautifully. The onion/pancetta combo was perfectly partnered with a rich tomato sauce. \n\nSecondi Piatti \nWe ordered separate main courses and shared everything. \n\nThe Saltimbocca alla Romana was $21.00. It's veal scaloppine topped with sage and prosciutto in a white wine sauce with mashed potato and swiss chard. This is going to be my order again the next time I am at Lupa.  What a wonderful dish!   Saltimbocca literally translates to \"jump in the mouth\" and that's what this entree did! \n\nWe also ordered the Filetto di Maiale al Vino Rosso which was $19.50.  It's a pan roasted pork tenderloin wrapped in smoked bacon, mashed fried polenta and swiss chard \nAgain, this was an entree that made both eyes and mouth water.  The wine reduction glaze was very good. \n\nDinner started with warm, crusty bread to be dipped into a delicious olive oil . When desserts were offered we really didn't have any room left--but, I did order the Torta di Limone (white chocolate/lemon cake) \"da portar via\" ( to go)! \n\nLupa is a great find.  Dinner came to $110.00 after taxes.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-02-12"}]}
