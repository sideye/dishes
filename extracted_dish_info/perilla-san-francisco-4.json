The reason I'm giving it four stars is because I think they still have a bit of organizing to do - my order was lost for a second and took a tad longer to get to me (30 minutes during low traffic hour) and I got up to refill my water while eating only to find one of the bussers thinking I was done with my over half full bowl and taking it back to the kitchen. Luckily, I caught her in time to let her know I was just filling up my water and will happily finish my food still. Even with those mishaps, everyone that worked there was so kind and smiling, the owner even came and asked me if I was enjoying the food. I think as they get more used to running their restaurant, it'll run more smoothly.\n\nONTO THE FOOD YAAASSSS. I ordered the Spicy Curry Chicken Noodle Soup.
