"], "author": "Mike C.", "review": "What is authentic Chinese food?\nLike any cuisine, the answer is defined by its audience.  While someone from the Midwest or Southern states might mention places like Panda Express and P.F. Chang, SoCal (Monterey Park and Rowland Heights mainly) residents, like in Monty Python's Holy Grail, might answer with another questions, \"What kind?\"... leading to a plethora of Northern style, Southern style, Hong Kong or Taiwan vs. Mainland styles, or lead into another question... \"What region?\"\nThis leads me to this quiet, hidden restaurant in the heart of the touristy part of Chinatown off of Grant Avenue.  \nMy mother was born in Shantou, center of Chiu Chow (also spelled Teo Cheow)people where, not only is the food different, the language and, in many ways, mentality is different.  When the Japanese occupied China during WWII, many locals from this region fled to Viet Nam and Singapore.  This is why many Vietnamese immigrants in the Bay Area likely speak Chiu Chow dialect.\nBack in the 1980's, there were two Chiu Chow restaurants, the upstairs restaurant now named Clay Pot City and a small place on 9th Avenue near Judah, now .\nBeing my mom's birthday, I wanted to do something special to celebrate and remembered that the owners are from there and offer some staple dishes.  \n\nAppetizers\n1) Shrimp Balls (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KLW-gN80RdqdAKqIKSowhg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I know... so many jokes can be made on this one.  Pretty good as the filling had the authentic flavor though the skin seemed a bit thick.  A bit pricey at $9.25 for four balls.\n\n2) Marinade Duck Chiu Chow style  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hSAu823ye17ZSyp4v2eWYw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This homestyle prepared dish is made in the traditional manner and served with a white vinegar garlic dipping sauce.  Being heavily flavored, goes well with rice. \n\nSoup\n3) Minced Beef Soup with Egg White  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_zlS9KApRoRBbroGUvJe9w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Never seen a restaurant apportion takeout soup in five individual small containers like this.  Would have be tastier with cilantro.\n\nMains\n4) Spicy Braised Chicken  - Even the owner warned me that this was not cooked in authentic Chiu Chow style with basil leaves.  This is a Chiu Chow cuisine signature dish that didn't quite hit the mark.\n\n5) Braised Rock Cod Fish Filet with Minced Pork, Shrimp, and Tofu Clay Pot (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pWQA4SfaquyoD5L69THPLQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -Recommended by the owner, this was just 'meh'.  No distinct flavor though cooked with peeled garlic cloves.  Pass.\n\n6) Olive Leaf Green Bean stir fry (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9m9A02tRBCaDRbSfSNP3lg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Another Chiu Chow dish, it was on the saltier side (too much olive leaves?) and would have benefited if cooked with ground pork for more flavoring.\n\nDessert\n7)  Taro pudding (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=K-mHhn5LWl7gI2_5zLYCqQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably the best dish of the evening.  Usually served family style, like the soup, apportioned in five small takeout containers.  Imagine your mom or grandmother mashing taro to a poi-like consistency, but with sweet flavors.  The gingko nuts confirmed the dish's authenticity.  A single serving is $5.75.\n\nSadly, my mom cannot fault me for the effort, but, if she knew what I paid for dinner, my ears would probably be chewed off.  All main dishes were $10.00 + with the fish being the tops at $16.75.\nI don't profess to be an expert in Chiu Chow cooking like my mom, but she's educated my palate to certain expectations.  From my first trip to Hong Kong when she told me about a small place upstairs in the herb district in Sheung Wan to the local places that opened in the late 1980's in Chinatown and in the Sunset District, she would order their staple dishes that bring back memories of her childhood.  In the late '80's to late '90's, my work travels took me to Hong Kong annually where my cousins would take me to a Chiu Chow restaurant near the Macau ferry.  Now, if only there was enough of an audience to warrant bringing those chefs here.

We did the math for them, telling the waitress (we wrote it down) which amount went on which credit card.  I swear this is true, another 15 minutes went by.  By this time I got up and went to the cashier/hostess.  I asked if there was a problem with our bill.  The woman said, \"Too many credit cards\" like their machine was overloaded or something like that made any sense.  So I had to leave to not start yelling.  I waited outside while my party finally got the checks to sign.  I realize in the food industry that splitting the check can be aggravating, but WE DID THE MATH FOR THEM.  All they had to do was run the amounts.\n\nI felt like we went from really important customers to completely unimportant.  This was supposed to be a special event for my family for Christmas and all the joy was sucked out waiting around for someone to see me with my hand raised waving frantically.

While someone from the Midwest or Southern states might mention places like Panda Express and P.F. Chang, SoCal (Monterey Park and Rowland Heights mainly) residents, like in Monty Python's Holy Grail, might answer with another questions, \"What kind?\"... leading to a plethora of Northern style, Southern style, Hong Kong or Taiwan vs. Mainland styles, or lead into another question... \"What region?\"\nThis leads me to this quiet, hidden restaurant in the heart of the touristy part of Chinatown off of Grant Avenue.  \nMy mother was born in Shantou, center of Chiu Chow (also spelled Teo Cheow)people where, not only is the food different, the language and, in many ways, mentality is different.  When the Japanese occupied China during WWII, many locals from this region fled to Viet Nam and Singapore.  This is why many Vietnamese immigrants in the Bay Area likely speak Chiu Chow dialect.\nBack in the 1980's, there were two Chiu Chow restaurants, the upstairs restaurant now named Clay Pot City and a small place on 9th Avenue near Judah, now .\nBeing my mom's birthday, I wanted to do something special to celebrate and remembered that the owners are from there and offer some staple dishes.  \n\nAppetizers\n1) Shrimp Balls (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KLW-gN80RdqdAKqIKSowhg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I know... so many jokes can be made on this one.  Pretty good as the filling had the authentic flavor though the skin seemed a bit thick.  A bit pricey at $9.25 for four balls.\n\n2) Marinade Duck Chiu Chow style  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hSAu823ye17ZSyp4v2eWYw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This homestyle prepared dish is made in the traditional manner and served with a white vinegar garlic dipping sauce.  Being heavily flavored, goes well with rice. \n\nSoup\n3) Minced Beef Soup with Egg White  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_zlS9KApRoRBbroGUvJe9w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Never seen a restaurant apportion takeout soup in five individual small containers like this.  Would have be tastier with cilantro.\n\nMains\n4) Spicy Braised Chicken  - Even the owner warned me that this was not cooked in authentic Chiu Chow style with basil leaves.  This is a Chiu Chow cuisine signature dish that didn't quite hit the mark.\n\n5) Braised Rock Cod Fish Filet with Minced Pork, Shrimp, and Tofu Clay Pot (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pWQA4SfaquyoD5L69THPLQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -Recommended by the owner, this was just 'meh'.  No distinct flavor though cooked with peeled garlic cloves.  Pass.\n\n6) Olive Leaf Green Bean stir fry (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9m9A02tRBCaDRbSfSNP3lg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Another Chiu Chow dish, it was on the saltier side (too much olive leaves?) and would have benefited if cooked with ground pork for more flavoring.\n\nDessert\n7)  Taro pudding (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=K-mHhn5LWl7gI2_5zLYCqQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably the best dish of the evening.  Usually served family style, like the soup, apportioned in five small takeout containers.  Imagine your mom or grandmother mashing taro to a poi-like consistency, but with sweet flavors.  The gingko nuts confirmed the dish's authenticity.  A single serving is $5.75.\n\nSadly, my mom cannot fault me for the effort, but, if she knew what I paid for dinner, my ears would probably be chewed off.  All main dishes were $10.00 + with the fish being the tops at $16.75.\nI don't profess to be an expert in Chiu Chow cooking like my mom, but she's educated my palate to certain expectations.  From my first trip to Hong Kong when she told me about a small place upstairs in the herb district in Sheung Wan to the local places that opened in the late 1980's in Chinatown and in the Sunset District, she would order their staple dishes that bring back memories of her childhood.  In the late '80's to late '90's, my work travels took me to Hong Kong annually where my cousins would take me to a Chiu Chow restaurant near the Macau ferry.  Now, if only there was enough of an audience to warrant bringing those chefs here.  Sadly, a magazine cover with Rachel Ray about under $40.00 per day adorns their entrance window (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q), evidence of the audience that they target.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-10-06"}], "chilled lychee": [{"excerpts": ["Caroline was kind enough to bring over a glass filled with chilled Lychee's for me...was a nice little Birthday treat.\n\n"], "author": "Flyinlow ..", "review": "As I made the right onto Clay off of Grant things started to feel familiar I entered Oriental Pearl, climbed up the stairs made another right into the entrance and realized I had been here back in 1998, was my 1st time.\n\nCaroline the current owner [daughter of the original owners] seated me in front of the fish tanks, said to her I had been here b/4 back in 1998 sat on the other side.
