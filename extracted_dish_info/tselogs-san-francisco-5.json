As soon as you step inside you're literally in the heart of everything - the take-out counter, the dining area, the kitchen and just a few steps, the restroom.  One side is a small counter and we were literally facing the kitchen where you see the cooks/staff take food out of the fridge, cook and prepare your meal. I don't remember how many people this side sits... six, maybe eight?  The wooden chairs have no backs and the seats aren't wide so, um, just take caution and take note if dining in. Behind us, well, I couldn't tell if this is another place to sit and eat because the long counter is even smaller but it may fit their tiny plates. No one sat on this side while we were there so I'm not sure. There were bar chairs.\n \nWe were given a menu. The silog choices were simple and served with garlic fried rice and one egg.  Everything looks so yummy! I was also eyeing other specials they have including palabok, arroz caldo and pancit bihon among others. And, yes, this tiny eatery also serves homemade desserts! I can't remember the choices but the halo-halo pie caught my eye.

With that being said, Tselogs would be the guy I have always wanted to date, but wasn't quite 100% sure about. Because he's rough around the edges, but once you've gotten a chance to date him once and get to know him, you think about him all the time. And want to date him again and again...no matter what the obstacles are. \n\nYes, it's that good. When I'm likening food to love, you know I'm hooked! \n\nI had just sang & danced my ass off at the Duran Duran concert in SF. It was close to midnight & I was hungry (like the wolf, haha. Sorry, couldn't resist!). What was still open? I checked my handy Yelp bookmarks & decided this would be my chance to try this place! I've read about it, as well as told that it was THE bizznomb by friend & fellow Yelper Lex. So I told my two favorite guys I was with, \"Come with me, let's try this place!\" We luckily found parking in this bustling area about two blocks away on a busy Saturday night. \n\nHere are all the Yesses. Yes, it's a small hole-in-the-wall spot. Yes, it's hard to find parking, though we lucked out (meant to be!). Yes, it's not in the greatest area, in the Tenderloin (though I wasn't in danger or scared, you just have to be alert). But even after all this, I say Yes, yes, YES, absolutely you must GO! Don't think about it, debate it, or doubt it. JUST GO, BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD! \n\nGOOD TO KNOW - There is a To-Go window! So you can call ahead & happily take your order with you. But we chose to dine there because there was no wait. But after a few minutes, there was a line out the door seven people deep!\n\nUpon walking in, if I had to guess, I would say about a dozen people fit in there. Barstool sitting against counters. Fully open kitchen diner-style. CLEAN, FRIENDLY, PERSONABLE, & DOWN-HOME FILIPINO COOKING! Just glancing at the menu made me happy. See pic for menu.\n\nA shout out to PATRICK, our server and MATT, our cook, who took care of us this night. \n\n** IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SIZZLING CHICKEN SISIG HERE! $9.99. This is what my brother ordered & I wanted to steal it because, after all, I am the older sister! He was generous & gave me some bites. :) Admittedly, I have never had sisig in my life & if I did, I just don't remember. (I know, I know, don't judge.) BUT THIS CHICKEN SISIG IS EVERYTHING! Marinated chicken grilled & served sizzling In a pan, with other ingredients on a separate plate for mixing - the garlic fried rice & egg. YOU MUST ORDER THIS. TRUST ME! I'm definitely getting this next time, and even one to-go! The flavors are undeniable the grilled, marinated chicken goodness is still haunting me & luring me back. All this FORKALICIOUS 5-STAR GOODNESS for only $9.99.\n\n** TAPSILOG (beef tapa) $9.99, was my choice, complete w/ garlic rice & fried egg. Very good & I do recommend! I enjoyed every bite of this and I would get this again. Though the chicken sisig is still the better-looking boyfriend. ;) \n\n** TOCILOG, marinated pork, the hubster's choice, was very good. He loved it so much, I looked over & it had already disappeared! Haha! $8.99.\n\nAt this price range for Filipino food in SF, I really don't think it gets better than this.

I regretted that I never got the opportunity to try it before I left. Several months before my most recent visit to SF in March 2016 I read an article about another Tselogs opening up in SF, situating itself in the space formerly occupied by Kare-Ken. The stars aligned this time and I was able to convince the No1DP to eat here for late breakfast.\n\nCONCEPT: Filipino breakfast is collectively referred to in the native tongue as -silog. It consists of a meat, garlic fried rice (sinangag) and egg (itlog). It is most emphatically NOT a healthy breakfast and actually tastes best after a night of drinking. When I'm home for the weekend I can be waken up early by the smell of the garlic fried rice or if I'm asked to cooked the rice or egg for the -silog breakfast.\n\nVENUE: The setting looked exactly the same as Kare-Ken: it's a TINY place somewhere in the Tenderloin. No1DP wouldn't feel too comfortable if I were to walk alone at night for a to-go dinner run. The place could probably seat 10 people max on the counters and twice that if they used the other side but that would be approaching being too crowded to the point of intruding other people's personal space. There's an open kitchen but even then that's tiny. It works when your brand calls for a small menu.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow but this is to be expected on a Saturday morning. Turns out she was also doing double-duty serving out to-go orders.\n\nWhile I was looking the menu I noticed that even being situated in SF the price of a -silog dish was less than $10. I was pleasantly surprised given that I expected SF prices to be high considering location but costs are similar to a -silog plate back in SD cities with a noticeable Filipino population. I'm glad that there are actually cheap yet GOOD options for dinner in the city.\n\n- No1DP got the embutidosilog ($7.99). He got it because a lot of the meats were too heavy for him to eat as the first meal of the day and the description said \"meatloaf\". Turned out that said meat contained pork, which is a meat he typically avoids but he was able to still eat most of his dish. I don't like embutido all that much.\n\n- I had my share of tapsilog, tosilog, longsilog, bangusilog and chicksilog from Filipino restaurants so I had their famous sizzling chicken sisigsilog ($8.99). Normal sisig is made with pork and the chicken variation was created as a healthier alternative. The sisig comes in its own cast-iron pan and is served sizzling. I could hear the chicken still being cooked as it was served. Some pieces of chicken were soft and tender and others that were exposed to the bottom of the pan were crispy. The lemon wedge makes a difference as it takes away from some of that fried aftertaste. Eggs were on the runny side (I usually like them less runny) and the No1DP and I observed that the rice cooled down rather quickly. Garlic fried rice is meant to be consumed hot.\n\nAs they were cooking I observed that the corned beef they use for their cornsilog was from the same company that my family buys when we make corned beef at home. Note that the corned beef is sourced from Australia and comes in a circular can, not the crappy American corned beef that comes in a square can. Though I can cook cornsilog, Filipino restaurants in SD do not serve cornsilog and I would like an option should I feel too lazy to cook.\n\nI'm glad that I was able to cross off another restaurant off my ever-growing list of restaurants to try in the Bay Area.

Traditional sisig usually consists of pork cheek, pork brains, pork ear and other fun parts of the pig. I guess to make it more appealing to the American public, they opted to use chicken instead. Fortunately the tselogs take on sisig is as delicious and possibly even better than most sisig dishes out there. When served it comes out on a sizzling stone skillet. The aroma that the sisig gives always makes me salivate. Each bite is salty and acidic. The blend of lemon, vinegar and soy sauce are flavors prominent within the sisig. What is somewhat missing in the tselogs version of the sisig is the spice of ginger and Chiles. I do love the tselogs version of the sisig as it gives the restaurant it's own flare to it and it appeals to both sisig lovers and those who have never tried sisig before. \n\nWhat I love about tselogs is the consistency in all their dishes. Whether it's this location or the one in Daly City, the food is consistently delicious from when it first reaches my table to when I knock out in my car from having a food coma.

"], "author": "Isabella B.", "review": "As a former Bay Area resident I've heard about the famous Tselogs in Daly City and had it on my list of restaurants to try. I regretted that I never got the opportunity to try it before I left. Several months before my most recent visit to SF in March 2016 I read an article about another Tselogs opening up in SF, situating itself in the space formerly occupied by Kare-Ken. The stars aligned this time and I was able to convince the No1DP to eat here for late breakfast.\n\nCONCEPT: Filipino breakfast is collectively referred to in the native tongue as -silog. It consists of a meat, garlic fried rice (sinangag) and egg (itlog). It is most emphatically NOT a healthy breakfast and actually tastes best after a night of drinking. When I'm home for the weekend I can be waken up early by the smell of the garlic fried rice or if I'm asked to cooked the rice or egg for the -silog breakfast.\n\nVENUE: The setting looked exactly the same as Kare-Ken: it's a TINY place somewhere in the Tenderloin. No1DP wouldn't feel too comfortable if I were to walk alone at night for a to-go dinner run. The place could probably seat 10 people max on the counters and twice that if they used the other side but that would be approaching being too crowded to the point of intruding other people's personal space. There's an open kitchen but even then that's tiny. It works when your brand calls for a small menu.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow but this is to be expected on a Saturday morning. Turns out she was also doing double-duty serving out to-go orders.\n\nWhile I was looking the menu I noticed that even being situated in SF the price of a -silog dish was less than $10. I was pleasantly surprised given that I expected SF prices to be high considering location but costs are similar to a -silog plate back in SD cities with a noticeable Filipino population. I'm glad that there are actually cheap yet GOOD options for dinner in the city.\n\n- No1DP got the embutidosilog ($7.99). He got it because a lot of the meats were too heavy for him to eat as the first meal of the day and the description said \"meatloaf\". Turned out that said meat contained pork, which is a meat he typically avoids but he was able to still eat most of his dish. I don't like embutido all that much.\n\n- I had my share of tapsilog, tosilog, longsilog, bangusilog and chicksilog from Filipino restaurants so I had their famous sizzling chicken sisigsilog ($8.99). Normal sisig is made with pork and the chicken variation was created as a healthier alternative. The sisig comes in its own cast-iron pan and is served sizzling. I could hear the chicken still being cooked as it was served. Some pieces of chicken were soft and tender and others that were exposed to the bottom of the pan were crispy. The lemon wedge makes a difference as it takes away from some of that fried aftertaste. Eggs were on the runny side (I usually like them less runny) and the No1DP and I observed that the rice cooled down rather quickly. Garlic fried rice is meant to be consumed hot.\n\nAs they were cooking I observed that the corned beef they use for their cornsilog was from the same company that my family buys when we make corned beef at home. Note that the corned beef is sourced from Australia and comes in a circular can, not the crappy American corned beef that comes in a square can. Though I can cook cornsilog, Filipino restaurants in SD do not serve cornsilog and I would like an option should I feel too lazy to cook.\n\nI'm glad that I was able to cross off another restaurant off my ever-growing list of restaurants to try in the Bay Area. On my next visit I definitely would like to try their variation of one of the traditional -silog dishes.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-13"}, {"excerpts": ["My friends got the chicken sisigsilog (Chicken Sisig Sizzling), which I was thinking I should have gotten since everyone seemed to be raving about it.

"], "author": "Isabella B.", "review": "As a former Bay Area resident I've heard about the famous Tselogs in Daly City and had it on my list of restaurants to try. I regretted that I never got the opportunity to try it before I left. Several months before my most recent visit to SF in March 2016 I read an article about another Tselogs opening up in SF, situating itself in the space formerly occupied by Kare-Ken. The stars aligned this time and I was able to convince the No1DP to eat here for late breakfast.\n\nCONCEPT: Filipino breakfast is collectively referred to in the native tongue as -silog. It consists of a meat, garlic fried rice (sinangag) and egg (itlog). It is most emphatically NOT a healthy breakfast and actually tastes best after a night of drinking. When I'm home for the weekend I can be waken up early by the smell of the garlic fried rice or if I'm asked to cooked the rice or egg for the -silog breakfast.\n\nVENUE: The setting looked exactly the same as Kare-Ken: it's a TINY place somewhere in the Tenderloin. No1DP wouldn't feel too comfortable if I were to walk alone at night for a to-go dinner run. The place could probably seat 10 people max on the counters and twice that if they used the other side but that would be approaching being too crowded to the point of intruding other people's personal space. There's an open kitchen but even then that's tiny. It works when your brand calls for a small menu.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow but this is to be expected on a Saturday morning. Turns out she was also doing double-duty serving out to-go orders.\n\nWhile I was looking the menu I noticed that even being situated in SF the price of a -silog dish was less than $10. I was pleasantly surprised given that I expected SF prices to be high considering location but costs are similar to a -silog plate back in SD cities with a noticeable Filipino population. I'm glad that there are actually cheap yet GOOD options for dinner in the city.\n\n- No1DP got the embutidosilog ($7.99). He got it because a lot of the meats were too heavy for him to eat as the first meal of the day and the description said \"meatloaf\". Turned out that said meat contained pork, which is a meat he typically avoids but he was able to still eat most of his dish. I don't like embutido all that much.\n\n- I had my share of tapsilog, tosilog, longsilog, bangusilog and chicksilog from Filipino restaurants so I had their famous sizzling chicken sisigsilog ($8.99). Normal sisig is made with pork and the chicken variation was created as a healthier alternative. The sisig comes in its own cast-iron pan and is served sizzling. I could hear the chicken still being cooked as it was served. Some pieces of chicken were soft and tender and others that were exposed to the bottom of the pan were crispy. The lemon wedge makes a difference as it takes away from some of that fried aftertaste. Eggs were on the runny side (I usually like them less runny) and the No1DP and I observed that the rice cooled down rather quickly. Garlic fried rice is meant to be consumed hot.\n\nAs they were cooking I observed that the corned beef they use for their cornsilog was from the same company that my family buys when we make corned beef at home. Note that the corned beef is sourced from Australia and comes in a circular can, not the crappy American corned beef that comes in a square can. Though I can cook cornsilog, Filipino restaurants in SD do not serve cornsilog and I would like an option should I feel too lazy to cook.\n\nI'm glad that I was able to cross off another restaurant off my ever-growing list of restaurants to try in the Bay Area.

As soon as you step inside you're literally in the heart of everything - the take-out counter, the dining area, the kitchen and just a few steps, the restroom.  One side is a small counter and we were literally facing the kitchen where you see the cooks/staff take food out of the fridge, cook and prepare your meal. I don't remember how many people this side sits... six, maybe eight?  The wooden chairs have no backs and the seats aren't wide so, um, just take caution and take note if dining in. Behind us, well, I couldn't tell if this is another place to sit and eat because the long counter is even smaller but it may fit their tiny plates. No one sat on this side while we were there so I'm not sure. There were bar chairs.\n \nWe were given a menu. The silog choices were simple and served with garlic fried rice and one egg.  Everything looks so yummy! I was also eyeing other specials they have including palabok, arroz caldo and pancit bihon among others. And, yes, this tiny eatery also serves homemade desserts! I can't remember the choices but the halo-halo pie caught my eye. This was my first time here and it took me a while to decide but finally went with tocilog (tocino meat) while hubby ordered his favorite, longsilog (longanisa). The plates the dishes were served on were small and the serving size seemed fit for a child but to my surprise my meal was filling and was just the right serving for me. It was tasty and delicious. The gals working there were nice... they didn't interact much with the patrons except to take your order and serve your food.  Oh well...\n \nThis restaurant is really the definition of a 'hole in the wall'.  Everything may be small but the flavorful meals packs on a big punch. Parking, as it is everywhere else in San Francisco, is always challenging. We were lucky to find one just right outside the eatery. Good luck!

One of the chefs immediately handed over a couple of menus and some water - and though I knew what I wanted, he was very happy to offer his recommendation to my dad - on and off menu. His recommendation was the spiced beef or the off-menu pork belly. \nI went for the arroz caldo and sisigsilog - both of which were great. The arroz was my favourite - if I'd chosen again I would have ordered a large arroz, added an egg and stuck to that. \nWe ordered an egg pie for dessert - and this is the only reason it doesn't get a 5*. It was tasty, however didn't taste the freshest - the pastry itself was a little stale tasting - I guess it was from yesterday. I still enjoyed it however. \nI settled the bill, and a couple minutes later the chef informed me he'd accidentally overcharged me.

I'm still Oooing & Aaaaing to myself when I think about my meal at Tselogs.  I never thought I would be impressed by Filipino food.  I'm Filipino, I grew up eating Filipino food all my life, & for the most part the cooking is simple, straightforward, & \"homey\" for the lack of a better word.  Welp.. I was wrong.\n\nI initially planned to get ramen that night, but once I got to the ramen place and saw the line was almost 1/2 a block long, plan B kicked in 'cause ain't nobody got time for that!  Reee-diculous.\n\nI got to Tselogs and the first thing I noticed was that it was really SMALL.  You have your tables to the left and your cooking/prepping space in direct view on the right.  There's about 12 seats in the restaurant so definitely be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors!  I chose to sit on the right, so I could watch the meals being prepared and because I like to have more table space when I'm eating.\n\nThe cashier/busser/server, all-around awesome guy explained the menu to me and he could probably tell I couldn't decide what to get because he quickly followed-up with explaining the \"combo\" where I could pick TWO items.  I settled on the tapsilog & sisigsilog combo.\n\nEach dish is usually paired with garlic fried rice with egg on top & some veggies.  The tapsilog - a sweet braised beef - was very tasty, but the real winner here was the sisigsilog.  It came out sizzling hot on a cast iron skillet with a lemon on top.  I took one bite & wow... Mind blown! The lemon was just the perfect touch.  The server recommended putting the itlog (egg) on top of the chicken, mixing it around the skillet, & then finishing it off with the lemon juice.  Freakin' amazing.  Why have I never had this dish?!?  So crazy.  I think the one thing they could improve on is their garlic fried rice.  It's good, but could be elevated SO much more. \n\nOverall though, the service was quick (it really needs to be in a restaurant this small to turn tables faster).

As soon as you step inside you're literally in the heart of everything - the take-out counter, the dining area, the kitchen and just a few steps, the restroom.  One side is a small counter and we were literally facing the kitchen where you see the cooks/staff take food out of the fridge, cook and prepare your meal. I don't remember how many people this side sits... six, maybe eight?  The wooden chairs have no backs and the seats aren't wide so, um, just take caution and take note if dining in. Behind us, well, I couldn't tell if this is another place to sit and eat because the long counter is even smaller but it may fit their tiny plates. No one sat on this side while we were there so I'm not sure. There were bar chairs.\n \nWe were given a menu. The silog choices were simple and served with garlic fried rice and one egg.  Everything looks so yummy! I was also eyeing other specials they have including palabok, arroz caldo and pancit bihon among others. And, yes, this tiny eatery also serves homemade desserts! I can't remember the choices but the halo-halo pie caught my eye. This was my first time here and it took me a while to decide but finally went with tocilog (tocino meat) while hubby ordered his favorite, longsilog (longanisa). The plates the dishes were served on were small and the serving size seemed fit for a child but to my surprise my meal was filling and was just the right serving for me. It was tasty and delicious. The gals working there were nice... they didn't interact much with the patrons except to take your order and serve your food.  Oh well...\n \nThis restaurant is really the definition of a 'hole in the wall'.  Everything may be small but the flavorful meals packs on a big punch.

I regretted that I never got the opportunity to try it before I left. Several months before my most recent visit to SF in March 2016 I read an article about another Tselogs opening up in SF, situating itself in the space formerly occupied by Kare-Ken. The stars aligned this time and I was able to convince the No1DP to eat here for late breakfast.\n\nCONCEPT: Filipino breakfast is collectively referred to in the native tongue as -silog. It consists of a meat, garlic fried rice (sinangag) and egg (itlog). It is most emphatically NOT a healthy breakfast and actually tastes best after a night of drinking. When I'm home for the weekend I can be waken up early by the smell of the garlic fried rice or if I'm asked to cooked the rice or egg for the -silog breakfast.\n\nVENUE: The setting looked exactly the same as Kare-Ken: it's a TINY place somewhere in the Tenderloin. No1DP wouldn't feel too comfortable if I were to walk alone at night for a to-go dinner run. The place could probably seat 10 people max on the counters and twice that if they used the other side but that would be approaching being too crowded to the point of intruding other people's personal space. There's an open kitchen but even then that's tiny. It works when your brand calls for a small menu.\n\nSERVICE: A little slow but this is to be expected on a Saturday morning. Turns out she was also doing double-duty serving out to-go orders.\n\nWhile I was looking the menu I noticed that even being situated in SF the price of a -silog dish was less than $10. I was pleasantly surprised given that I expected SF prices to be high considering location but costs are similar to a -silog plate back in SD cities with a noticeable Filipino population. I'm glad that there are actually cheap yet GOOD options for dinner in the city.\n\n- No1DP got the embutidosilog ($7.99). He got it because a lot of the meats were too heavy for him to eat as the first meal of the day and the description said \"meatloaf\". Turned out that said meat contained pork, which is a meat he typically avoids but he was able to still eat most of his dish. I don't like embutido all that much.\n\n- I had my share of tapsilog, tosilog, longsilog, bangusilog and chicksilog from Filipino restaurants so I had their famous sizzling chicken sisigsilog ($8.99). Normal sisig is made with pork and the chicken variation was created as a healthier alternative. The sisig comes in its own cast-iron pan and is served sizzling. I could hear the chicken still being cooked as it was served. Some pieces of chicken were soft and tender and others that were exposed to the bottom of the pan were crispy. The lemon wedge makes a difference as it takes away from some of that fried aftertaste. Eggs were on the runny side (I usually like them less runny) and the No1DP and I observed that the rice cooled down rather quickly. Garlic fried rice is meant to be consumed hot.\n\nAs they were cooking I observed that the corned beef they use for their cornsilog was from the same company that my family buys when we make corned beef at home. Note that the corned beef is sourced from Australia and comes in a circular can, not the crappy American corned beef that comes in a square can. Though I can cook cornsilog, Filipino restaurants in SD do not serve cornsilog and I would like an option should I feel too lazy to cook.\n\nI'm glad that I was able to cross off another restaurant off my ever-growing list of restaurants to try in the Bay Area.

The presentation is excellent and all the components match and complement but also show Filipino inspiration and tradition (garlic rice and egg!).

The lumpia shanghai needed a little more kick such as perhaps shrimp or salt and the wrapper wasn't as crunchy as it could be but again I could see how careful they were not to overcook it so clearly care is given.

It's a tiny little Filipino restaurant that cooks up some decent sisig! Ever since I've had Papa Urb's sisig, I've been searching for a Filipino restaurant locally that can make it just as good. Unfortunately, Tselogs didn't live up to that expectation. However, they do provide a nice sizzling sisig-silog skillet!\n\nI came here on a Monday evening before attending my first Yelp event. When I walked in, I was greeted right away by one of the cooks. He gave me the menu and explained the items and the process. You pick one entr\u00e9e and are able to add the \"silog\" portion which is a scoop of garlic rice topped with an egg. Since I was craving sisig, I decided to order the sisig-silog. As I mentioned before, this place is super tiny! There are no \"tables\" here per say. It's set up like a bar where you sit at the counter. It's not an ideal setup for a large group but a nice place to stop by for a quick dinner.\n\nMy food arrived and it was a sight for sore eyes! That skillet was sizzling up a storm! The smell radiated the little room and my mouth started watering. Per other Yelper's suggestions, I mashed the egg into the rice and mixed that into the sisig. My expectations were super high, especially after watching the grand sizzling entrance of my entr\u00e9e. Although it was an eye catcher, the flavors just weren't up to par. It was definitely lacking something, but I couldn't quite figure out just what. I usually like my sisig with green onions, Sriracha sauce, and cream. I don't know if that is the Americanized way of eating it, but that's what I was looking for.  It had a decent flavor to it and the meat was hot and tender but it could have used more seasoning.\n\nThe portion size was just enough to fill you up. No leftovers, but it did the job. The cook checked in on me and refilled my water cup without me having to ask. He gave me a punch card that would allow me to gain a free entr\u00e9e after so many visits.
