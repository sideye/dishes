You're probably laughing at me but once you get into your 30s, nothing sounds more alluring than plopping your hinny onto the couch after work and watching trashy reality tv. \"Thigh brows on fleek\", is the latest thing I learned. So it's cool to have bush sticking out of your panties from both sides?  \n\nAnyhow, we were debating what to have for dinner. \n\nMe: \"What do you want for dinner?\"\nMr. NSS: \"Something cheap.\"\n\nMe: \"I can cook but first I need to shop at the market.\"\nMr. NSS: \"Uhh, shopping and cooking, buzzed/drunk? You'll max out my card and chop off your fingers in the process...what about In-N-Out?\"\n\nMe: \"Umm, I guess--are you driving?\"\nMr. NSS *looks outside the bar to see rain*\n\nBoth of us: \"Pizza delivery!\"\n\nI hate doughy, thick crust pizzas so I came across Twin Peaks Pizza & Pasta on Yelp; they offer thin crust and corn meal crusts (+$1). You can order on their website (there's a $2 off $25 coupon code listed) or through GrubHub but neither offered the capability of ordering half & half specialty pizzas so I called in our order. The woman who took my order was very professional and surprisingly very friendly. I ordered an XL Pizza with Half Spicy Sausage & Honey (w/ mozzarella, mascarpone, parsley + red onion) and Half Twin Peaks (pepperoni, salami, sausage & mushrooms). An XL feeds 3-4 people but we always over order for leftovers. She said, the pizza would be delivered within an hour. It was delivered in 54 minutes. \n\nThe pizza arrived lukewarm so the crust was a bit too chewy but it was better than eating a doughy crusted pizza from other neighboring pizza joints: http://bit.ly/1UXpBDo. My half was the Spicy Sausage & Honey which was a good balance of spicy, salty, and sweet but they were skimpy on the sausage. One of the slices had just one sausage which was a bummer. Mr. NSS' enjoyed his Twin Peaks half which had more robust toppings. \n\nGood pizza aside, my biggest issue was the price. I know everything in SF is getting ridonkulously expensive but I've never paid so much for pizza delivery in my life. Usually, when you do half and half orders, they charge you for the more expensive half. Per their website, an XL Spicy Sausage & Honey is $30.67 and an XL Twin Peaks is $33.66. I was charged $33.66 plus $3.89 for ordering the Spicy Sausage & Honey which is the cheaper half. With tax and tip, our total was $47.84...for pizza! \n\nAhh the price you pay for being a lazy, drunk heffer.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-09-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Last night I had a very good experience ordering a pizza from Twin Peaks Pizza.

The crust, sauce, cheese, toppings - they were all perfect.  I began to visit more often.\n\nDuring one of my visits, while standing at the counter waiting to sign my credit card receipt, I noticed the cook peeling tomatoes and stewing them.  I asked Bruno if what I was seeing was the norm, if they were indeed making their own sauce.  He confirmed that they make their sauce and dough from scratch, and that their cheese is freshly grated.  Their veggies are never frozen, and their meats are from high-quality and reputable ranches.\n\nIt doesn't get better than that.

Their crust is the right thickness, and you can request thicker or thinner if that suites your preferences, and the fact you can order online, is AMAZING!  when will more take-out places catch on to how convenient it is to order via a website?  \n\nThe only complaint I have about this place is that they have magnets they give you with your pizza's and once you collect 10 you are supposed to get a free pizza.  Well I order from here weekly and it seems like about 1 out of every 3 pizzas I get they actually remember to put a magnet on the box....it would be cool if I didn't have to order 30 pizzas to get 10 magnets.  A promotional deal is a promotional deal and it's something that I feel should should be a priority to make sure every order receives a magnet, if you are going to offer a perk you should be consistent about it.  \n\nAside from my gripe about the magnets this place has pretty good food, and is worth checking out if you haven't eaten there...and if you have well, it's probably pretty obvious why you keep going back.\nAlso, try my favorite!! A cheese pizza with extra cheese and extra sauce!  it is DELICIOUS and for me a very nostalgic taste.  I also love the Brazilian salad minus the tomatoes with blue cheese dressing!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-05-08"}, {"excerpts": ["About a month ago I spoke to the owner about how I like ordering their salads (especially the Brazilian Salad with heart of palm - yum!), but that the fact that they use plastic \"clam-shells\" to package their salad to go gives me pause, being that the clam-shell is not recyclable in SF.
