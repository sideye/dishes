One of my co-workers has been raving on and on about this place so I finally agreed to go. \n\nWe walked from our office to the restaurant which is on the corner of 2nd and Market Street. I have to mention that this is a DIRTY part of the city b/c we found a nice steamy pile of yuck on the corner. \n\nWe went inside and there were tables spread out on a lower level and more seating up the stairs. We sat on the upper level towards the middle of the establishment. \n\nThe tables were small, marble garden tables.. we sat at one not wanting to take one of the wall tables that were for a party of 6. Which we regretted after we got our food.\n\nThe menu only had 4 items on it but the waitress told me they had tandoori chicken if i wanted (it wasn't on the menu). I ordered the Tandoori Chicken, someone ordered the curry chicken, my mgr ordered Paneer curry, and the guy that suggested the place ordered Lamb curry. Everything was served with naan and rice. My tandoori chicken was delish... i haven't had a place mess up tandoori chicken yet. All of the food was actually really good! For drinks we ordered different types of lassi: mango, salt, and a spice one. The consistency was off for the spice one.. there were big chunks of ice in it.. not blended well. The mango lassi was just ok.. the consistency wasn't as thick as i've had it else where, but it tasted ok. I didn't try the salt lassi.\n\nI must say I am disappointed with their service. Our main dishes came out prompt but the naan and rice took forever to come out, we even had to ask for it. The table was so small that they couldn't give us all our rice and naan at the same time and we had to share which was fine except we had to keep asking for more when we ran out and it took long for them to give it to us. \n\nAfter we were done, they gave us the check but never came back to check our payment.. I had to stand up and give our check to the lady. (the place wasn't even that busy). \n\nI'd order togo from this place just because the food was good, but i will probably never eat in again.", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-06-28"}], "zeera lassi": [], "zafrani lassi": [{"excerpts": ["If you are a fan of the original tart froyo flavor, you should definitely try the Zafrani Lassi, which has the same tart creaminess with a bonus of other fruity flavors and spices.\n\n"], "author": "Josephine L.", "review": "My co-worker took me here for lunch on my first day (yay corporate expense account!) and we really enjoyed the food. There's some interesting stuff here even on the lunch menu that a lot of Indian places don't have.\n\nWe both decided to do combos of one whole dish and a second half-dish (for $5.99). She got the Tandoori Salmon and Bhindi Masala, and I got the Punjabi Goat Curry and Laganshala. We also both got Zafrani Lassis, because I'd heard that was the unique thing to get here.\n\nAll of the dishes were tasty, but the salmon took the cake for most aromatic. It came on a sizzling plate and smelled wonderful--fish mixed with an array of exotic spices combined with vegetables. It was pretty delicious, though I couldn't have eaten an entire dish of it as it was quite rich. If you're not an okra fan like me, skip the Bhindi Masala. No amount of spices can cover up that slimy saliva texture. Yuck! The Goat Curry was a little spicy and very tasty, with tender pieces of goat meat. The Laganshala sounded great, but seemed kind of....bland....to me. If you are a fan of the original tart froyo flavor, you should definitely try the Zafrani Lassi, which has the same tart creaminess with a bonus of other fruity flavors and spices.\n\nDespite the fact that we had a \"sit-down\" lunch, the food came out really fast. Yet, we were allowed to enjoy at our leisure without ever feeling rush.
