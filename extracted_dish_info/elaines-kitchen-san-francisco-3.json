Unless you are drunk and in desperate need of Chinese food to satisfy your alcohol-derived munchies. Then, yes, you would be banging on Elaine's window to open up and give you something to devour. Jamie W. and I, however, were completely sober when we walked over here after a weekend up in Mendocino. I can't say the same about the loudish party across the room whose indecisiveness had Elaine in a bit of a tizzy. We were admiring her pluck.\n\nEven though we had In-n-Out in Santa Rosa on the way back home, we still ordered a lot of food. We started with the $4.95 Spring Rolls which we always forget are not the freshly wrapped ones but the deep-fried ones with the requisite cherry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1KSS8Yl). Pure Panda Express level here, but Elaine compensated by giving us a $4.95 bowl of Hot & Sour Soup free of charge (photo: http://bit.ly/1RnSLLz). This was pretty good, not quite Henry's Hunan level but it did hit the spot to counteract the grease of the rolls. Since we are planning a trip to Shanghai later this year, I had us try their $6.95 Shanghai Pork Steamed Dumplings since it seemed like a good deal given you get ten in a bamboo steamer (photo: http://bit.ly/1GqknJH). They were pretty darn tasty.\n\nThey had the squish factor down, something Jamie and I will try to replicate at our planned dumpling making lesson in Shanghai. Jamie ordered his favorite, the $7.95 General Tso's Chicken, which were prepared with chicken tenders deep-fried in a garlic sauce. The steamed broccoli florets were wholly unnecessary (photo: http://bit.ly/1FPa5Yw). I felt we needed at least one vegetable dish, but I failed and went for the $7.95 House Special Eggplant, which had plenty of sauteed eggplant but also chicken, beef pork and shrimp (photo: http://bit.ly/1QRnrnR). So frankly there wasn't anything veggie about it. Maybe I should have eaten the broccoli florets.
