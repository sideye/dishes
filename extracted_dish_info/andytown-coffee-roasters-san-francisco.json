This cortado was freaking amazing! Completely and perfectly amazing! Incredible depth of flavor, incredible color, amazing texture and mouth feel and just as importantly, perfect temperature! It was a caffeinated, mouth-gasm! \n\nI'll put it to you this way! Having this cortado is comparable to having been with a truly amazing lover. One that came in your life, broadened your horizons, created a deep and completely immersive experience and then left you just as quickly as they came, leaving you in a deep crater of emotional baggage, slightly confused how to proceed now that you've tasted the best. Do you explore to find better or do you settle for crappy lovers, I mean coffee? \n\nLuckily, we can have that great coffee experience over and over again. At Andytown's! Me?! I'm going to keep searching for really good coffee and comparing it to Andytown's and a couple of other places that have given me really good coffee.

The artsy vibe looks straight out of Pinterest, with lots of wood and an airy feel from the tall ceilings. Props to a clean bathroom, which is artsy as well. \n\nI find it an energizing environment that's decent for getting work done. The side tables against the wall can hardly fit your laptop and a cup of coffee, but the communal table is spacious. (The only catch is getting hungry staring at the delicious pastries, but realizing $7 pie pockets are not within your budget)\n\nSnowy plover $4 || Andytown's specialty soda with coffee, topped with house-made cream. Yes, soda with coffee sounds questionable, and it's exactly how it turns out--strange at first, but you it grows on you. It's a bit of an acquired taste type of drink, but whipped cream always makes it tasty at the end of the day. I would recommend if you would like to cross this off your foodie bucket list, but I wouldn't be craving soda coffee per se.\n\nCappuccino $3.50 || Woaw, you can tell from their espresso drinks that their coffee beans are of superb quality. On weekends, you might even see them roasting beans in the back. My main complaint is that there was no latte art on the cappucino.\n\nWheat soda bread with butter $4 || The obligatory $4 toast, now considered an SF norm. Pricey considering any other spreads are a hefty extra charge ($2.75 for the addition of ham cheddar and bacon... can probably get you an entire breakfast sando at most normal places) I'm usually not a fan of soda bread, but I did enjoy this because it tasted so fresh and hearty with the whole wheat composition.\n\nStrawberry corn muffin $3.25 || Cruffins and cronuts are everywhere, but why don't I ever see a corn bread muffin? This was rather ingenious, because the shape of the muffin (and extra wide muffin top!) allowed for corn bread with an extra crunch. The filling of strawberry jam paired very well, not in an odd sweet-and-savory kind of way, but in a natural muffinness/dessertness. Wonderfully clever flavors and textures.\n\nJalapeno cheddar corn muffin $4 || Mmm, the savory, more provocative cousin of the fruit corn muffin. Excellent kick with the jalapeno and burnt cheddar.\n\nOverall, Andytown Coffee Roasters is a unique cafe worth checking out, and it's much more friendly than Trouble with their troublesome mannerisms.

The shot of Espresso is a welcomed escape from the other overly eager parents back on the greens. The Espresso and its invigorating aroma give him the much needed energy to enjoy the gatorade flavored kisses from his little soccer star.\n\nTo a college student, the afternoon coffee is a weekend luxury in the form of a Almond Milk Latte. The unassuming latte art complements her leather jacket perfectly to complete an image of a budding artist. The flavors are pronounced, but not overwhelming. The touch of sweetness from the latte is just enough to entice the college student to take her first step into the sophisticated world of coffee. \n\nTo the loyal house puppy, an afternoon coffee is the flurry of relentless attempts at its companion's buttery Soda Bread. It is also a time to say hello to other dogs and lick the Barista. The last part is important because the Barista is known to have dog treats from time to time, and that would easily be a house puppy's favorite part of an afternoon coffee.\n\nTo me, my afternoon coffee is the Snowy Plover, an iced, fizzy espresso topped off with a healthy serving of whipped cream. It is reminiscent of a fifth grade root beer, bringing me back to a time when all my worries resided inside a Pokemon game. The jolt of caffeine reminds me that I'm now15 years older and none the wiser. There's nothing like pondering about life over an afternoon coffee.\n\nWhat is an afternoon coffee to Andytown? It is everything. It is providing a place where a soccer dad can tune down with son. It is helping the student slowly assimilate to the coffee culture through the beauty of their latte art. It is giving a man's best friend another opportunity to hang out with the person it loves most. \nFinally, an afternoon coffee to Andytown is giving people like me a place to cultivate my ideas and write down my inspirations. This afternoon coffee may very well be the first of my many, many steps in fulfilling my dream of becoming a writer.\n\nThank you, Andytown, for giving us our cup of afternoon coffee!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-04-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Two words: SNOWY PLOVER.

It's a small corner cafe, and when I say small I mean small. I think maybe 15 people can sit in there. Their pastries looked delicious and the soda bread that you can add cheddar and bacon too sounded bomb. I got a snowy plover per my friends request because she says \"I don't know if I hate it or love it\". I believe the snowy plover is coffee with Pellegrino and creme fraiche on top. Sounds weird but has an interesting taste, I am now at that crossroads as my friend. I can't tell if I love it or hate it. It's good but when you first sip it you get the Pellegrino carbonation which is just interesting in a coffee drink. The coffee in the snowy plover was delicious so I would definitely go back to try a coffee and soda bread with cheddar and bacon.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Snowy Plover, try it.

There's also non-coffee choices, such as hot cocoa and tea.\n\nThe food menu includes soda bread, scones, sausage rolls (highly recommended) and cookies.\n\nThe Sunset is lucky to have a coffee roaster, and a cafe that doesn't have the pretension of other coffee places in SF.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-03-22"}, {"excerpts": ["I also was a rebel and tried their hot cocoa. \n", "You can opt for a fresh whipped cream to go with your drinks "], "author": "Tracy Joy K.", "review": "I have been to my fair share of independent roasters and Andytown definitely impressed me! Located in the Outer Sunset it brings a hipster style but friendly and welcoming service. There was a bit of a line when we came but since parking was so easy we decided to try it out! The line goes faster than it looks, it is mostly long on account for how tiny the place is. \n\nThey serve your standard brewed espresso drinks but also an interesting drink called the Snowy Plover - a coffee soda would be the best way to describe it! I also was a rebel and tried their hot cocoa. \nYou can opt for a fresh whipped cream to go with your drinks :)\n\nI loved that they have a select variety of baked items as well, all huge and yummy. We tried four different baked goods including my favorite the Peach and Goat Cheese corn muffing along with Blueberry corn muffin, chocolate scone and cherry scone. \n\nI appreciated their friendly service and really great value considering all we ordered! Will definitely be back :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-08-03"}]}
