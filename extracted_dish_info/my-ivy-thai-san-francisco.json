Suckered in by the promise of free, quick delivery, I hit \"order\" and went for it.\n\nOne look at \"Lychee duck\" and I knew I had to try it, too. And Tom Kha soup *gush*. I love Thai food :D. My staple Pad Thai rounded out the order.\n\nSo do I start with good news or bad news? Uh, I'm feeling pretty good...let's do good news!\nThe Lychee duck is DELICIOUS, just like it sounds. Duck is already amazing; soak it in lychee water and it only gets better. Of course it's not like this is a particularly complex dish, but it sure is tasty.\n\nTom Kha was decent but a bit middle of the road. Should be a little more savory in my opinion.\n\nWould not order the pad thai again. I ordered it spicy and it was totally mild, which is excusable as pad thai is not traditionally served spicy. It was also super bland. Ho hum. \n\nOh, as if you needed another reason to love Yelp and Eat24, I tried to order this first through Caviar...where the prices are inexplicably more than a dollar higher on every item I looked at...AND they threw on a $5 service fee before tip! Nah. I ordered with Yelp, applied a generous tip, and my total was STILL less than Caviar was BEFORE tip. \n\nOh, and speed of delivery was definitely solid.\n\nIt's disappointing that they're not open late, and with the other good thai food in the area, I probably won't go back here on my own.

The food was quite a disappointment.   The menu is very limited (particularly in vegetables), all the dishes are a lot smaller than you would expect for the price, and nothing tastes particularly fresh or good.\n\nWe ordered Fresh Spring Rolls (raw vegetables wrapped in rice paper), and asked them to omit tofu; the waitress checked with the kitchen, and reported that they could NOT omit tofu because the rolls were all made in advance, and they specifically refused to make one to order.  (The restaurant was empty at the time except for us.)  We ordered it anyway and picked out the tofu, and indeed it tasted tired and pre-made.  Another appetizer was Salmon Rolls, small amounts of mashed salmon rolled up in wonton wrappers and deep-fried; the filling tasted OK, but the wrappers were much too thick and chewy so they dominated the salmon and were hard to eat (four small rolls).\n\nFor entrees, we had Pumpkin (Kabocha) Curry with chicken; the red curry sauce was OK, with nice coconut milk flavor, but the dish was small with very little chicken and even less pumpkin (five small cubes).  Another dish was Spicy Eggplant with Pork; this lacked flavor (it was certainly not spicy, at all), had pork cut too thick, and was again short on eggplant (half a dozen pieces).  Carmelized lychee duck featured good roasted duck, but the raw spinach salad served under it had a distasteful sweet dressing, completely inedible.  Trying to get more green vegetables, we had asked for anything made with asparagus, gai lan, snow peas, dao miu, bok choy, sugar snap peas--anything, but nothing was available.  The only green vegetables in the kitchen (we were told) were broccoli, green beans, cabbage, and spinach.  We ordered a side dish of Steamed Mixed Vegetables with Garlic Sauce; it included carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, and a little cabbage,but didn't have much flavor (and in particular we couldn't taste any garlic to speak of).  \n\nTwo appetizers and four entrees made a scant dinner for two, because the portions were so small.\n\nThe wine list is extremely limited, and restricted to only a few very modest choices.  But corkage is offered at $10, so you should take your own wine.  (We did, and the wine service was fine.)\n\nThe restaurant space is clean and new, but minimal.  Very few people came in to sit down while we were there, but there was a trickle of take-away customers.  Service was competent, but not particularly attentive.\n\nComparing My Ivy to its neighborhood competition, a much better choice would be the nearby Sweet Lime thai restaurant.  Sweet Lime has a wider menu, more vegetables, larger portions, and all the food there tastes much fresher.  It also has a nicer environment, full of fresh flowers, very gracious and welcoming service, and a more-extensive wine list.\n\nI cannot recommend My Ivy based on this visit.

Just a couple of people were seated. So service was fairly quick (just one person was manning the phone, serving tables and taking our orders). We had two dishes, an appetizer, and two deserts and liked the deserts best.\n\nThe appetizer, Golden Calamari, was our least favorite. The calamari was tough, and was served under a glaze of a too sweet Thai smoked chili paste. For calamari, less would have been more: they should have been served straight up with the sauces on the side for dipping if needed. And the quality of the calamari itself could really been improved by not overcooking them.\n\nThe Pineapple Fried Rice was good. Kind of a Singapore curry flavor going on, with slices of chicken, and chunks of pineapple with onions and cashews, but we did not have an \"OMG, this is amazing\" kind of moment. We had such a large serving that we took most of this home.\n\nWe also had their dish that they called \"Ivy Best Friends\" which are three things served together but separated: Boneless BBQ Chicken (thigh served dry), shredded green papaya salad, and a black sticky rice served with a thin sweet and sour sauce. Separately these items were OK (the crispy-skinned chicken was a bit on the dry side for a thigh) but really were at their best when mixed, all the different textures of sweet, sour, crunchy, chewy, tangy, cold and hot were all represented in this dish. \n\nThe execution of this entree might have been better if the chicken were more juicy and had more inherent flavor, but this dish had a great potential to be an eye-opening lesson on why Thai food is so good at combining so many textures and tastes into their wondrous cuisine.\n\nThe deserts were the stand-out for us: Mango Sticky Rice and Fried Banana with coconut Ice Cream. \n\nThe sticky rice was amazing: this warm short-grained white rice was so dense and chewy that it seemed like it was on its way to being mochi, covered in a thick, sweet coconut milk. This was perfectly offset by mango slices that were not too sweet, so they complemented the rice's sweet stickiness with a firm cold tartness.\n\nThe Fried Bananas were coated in a perfectly crisped batter that was not oily and were perfectly sweet. Again those many textures: cold sweet coconut ice cream, crunchy warm and sweet banana fritters--just heaven in a spoon.\n\nWe would definitely visit this place again to check out their other main dishes.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-11-10"}, {"excerpts": ["My fav were \"Golden Calamari\" \n\"Salmon Rolls", "\" \"Papaya Salad\" and \"Seafood fried rice\"  ", "The food tasted fantastic.

The food was quite a disappointment.   The menu is very limited (particularly in vegetables), all the dishes are a lot smaller than you would expect for the price, and nothing tastes particularly fresh or good.\n\nWe ordered Fresh Spring Rolls (raw vegetables wrapped in rice paper), and asked them to omit tofu; the waitress checked with the kitchen, and reported that they could NOT omit tofu because the rolls were all made in advance, and they specifically refused to make one to order.  (The restaurant was empty at the time except for us.)  We ordered it anyway and picked out the tofu, and indeed it tasted tired and pre-made.  Another appetizer was Salmon Rolls, small amounts of mashed salmon rolled up in wonton wrappers and deep-fried; the filling tasted OK, but the wrappers were much too thick and chewy so they dominated the salmon and were hard to eat (four small rolls).\n\nFor entrees, we had Pumpkin (Kabocha) Curry with chicken; the red curry sauce was OK, with nice coconut milk flavor, but the dish was small with very little chicken and even less pumpkin (five small cubes).  Another dish was Spicy Eggplant with Pork; this lacked flavor (it was certainly not spicy, at all), had pork cut too thick, and was again short on eggplant (half a dozen pieces).  Carmelized lychee duck featured good roasted duck, but the raw spinach salad served under it had a distasteful sweet dressing, completely inedible.  Trying to get more green vegetables, we had asked for anything made with asparagus, gai lan, snow peas, dao miu, bok choy, sugar snap peas--anything, but nothing was available.  The only green vegetables in the kitchen (we were told) were broccoli, green beans, cabbage, and spinach.  We ordered a side dish of Steamed Mixed Vegetables with Garlic Sauce; it included carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, and a little cabbage,but didn't have much flavor (and in particular we couldn't taste any garlic to speak of).  \n\nTwo appetizers and four entrees made a scant dinner for two, because the portions were so small.\n\nThe wine list is extremely limited, and restricted to only a few very modest choices.  But corkage is offered at $10, so you should take your own wine.  (We did, and the wine service was fine.)\n\nThe restaurant space is clean and new, but minimal.  Very few people came in to sit down while we were there, but there was a trickle of take-away customers.  Service was competent, but not particularly attentive.\n\nComparing My Ivy to its neighborhood competition, a much better choice would be the nearby Sweet Lime thai restaurant.  Sweet Lime has a wider menu, more vegetables, larger portions, and all the food there tastes much fresher.  It also has a nicer environment, full of fresh flowers, very gracious and welcoming service, and a more-extensive wine list.\n\nI cannot recommend My Ivy based on this visit.
