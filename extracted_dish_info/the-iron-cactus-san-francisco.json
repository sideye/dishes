He drops our entrees off, then proceeds to bus all of the dirty tables, followed by him entering the food preparation area and picking up more entrees for guests. Still with the same dirty glove on. He drops them off at their respective tables. With the same dirty-ass glove on. I mention this to the lady at the cash register, who appears to also be filling the manager role. I tell her it's not a safe practice and he needs to remove his one glove and wash his hands after bussing dirty tables, before picking up guests' food. She agrees to talk to him. She does, then he removes his dirty glove and happily prepares his own lunch at the food preparation area-without washing his hands prior to doing so. If I needed a sign that none of my message had landed with the manager, it came quickly. She takes a new client's order, rings him up, heads straight to the food preparation area without washing her hands, grabs a tortilla and throws it on the grill, patting the tortilla several times, heads to the dining area to bus tables (as ALL of the employees are taking their lunch (this never happens when the gentleman I mention above is acting as the manager), buses tables, heads jack to the food preparation area without washing her hands after handling two tables-worth of dirty dishes, and continues to grab the tortilla off the grill with her bare hands and hands the dude his hepatitis A burrito.

First, I was pretty impressed by their menu.  A good variety of typical Mexican taqueria classics, plus an added bonus for me.  They actually have an alternative to meat which isn't very common in Mexican spots.  They had tofu burritos.  Love it.  \n\nOn top of the diverse menu, the atmosphere is pretty cool.  Certainly nicer than a typical hole in the wall taqueria, more restaurant vibe.  Lots of vintage(or vintage looking) wood, bid tables, consistent decor.  It all fits the vibe well.  It is an \"order and sit\" spot, which is nice and casual.  The people working there were super nice and friendly.\n\nNow to the food...the food was good.  \nWas it the best Mexican food ever?  No.  \nWas it quality?  Yes.  \nWere the portions substantial?  Yes.  \n(People were complaining about \"small sizes\", I'm a 6'2\" 200lb athlete, and I was full on a burrito.)\nWas it worth the $? Yes. \n(We had two meals and a sangria for $20.)\n\nI'd certainly come back next time I'm hitting a Giants game, probably try something different for fun next time.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-11"}, {"excerpts": ["1 burrito plz\"\n\n", "burrito is ok size.

My excitement was short-lived though.\n\nI had lunch here on Friday morning.  I managed to get in just before the crunch of the lunch time masses.  You order at the counter and you're given a number.  You pay and you wait for your number to be called.

I ordered a Crispy Taco plate with pollo asado (grilled chicken).  Rice, choice of beans and a green salad come with the tacos.  As is my norm I chose the whole black beans although it was interesting to see that they offer refried black beans in addition to the regular refried beans.\n\nThe person that takes your order is the person that prepares your food.  The wait for my food was fairly short.  For take out orders I notice they use biodegradable utensils.  You can also use metal utensils if you're eating in.

My food preparer put lots of chicken meat into the crispy taco shells, but she forgot to give me cheese.  Sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo (salsa) come on the plate along with the rice, salad and beans.  The chicken was all big chunks of warm, tender, moist chicken breast.  The orange colored seasoning on the chicken was not well defined though and the chicken just tasted bland.  I added parts of my salad, which is served plain with a small lemon wedge, into the taco shell along with the sour cream, the guac and the salsa.\n\nI like chunky guacamole and the avocado here is whipped up too smoothly.  It kind of just ran off of the taco shell instead of staying put.  The Spanish rice mixed with peas and corn was just slightly warm too.  The place is still new so I kind of expect some of the shortfalls.  I'll definitely come back again.

The unassuming exterior belies the soaring ceilings and brick walls inside:  while not exactly \"cozy,\" the space is homey - warm, inviting, and clean.\n\nLet's get it straight:  Iron Cactus is not competing with dive Mexican places in The Mission.  Situated in South Beach, it caters to more refined tastes than the traditional taqueria at 16th and Mission.  Yes, the offerings may not be as spicy as El Farolito or Pancho Villa, but they are also not as greasy, nor as dangerous to your health - organic and sustainable where possible, the establishment uses ingredients that won't kill you.\n\nThe menu sticks to the basics:  burritos, tacos, quesadillas, etc.  There is nothing inventive here, and it is just as well.  In a setting such as this, diners are looking for tried and true favorites, not foamed creations from Ferran Adri\u00e0 from El Bulli.\n\nPatrons cannot go wrong with any of the burritos, quesadillas, or salads from Iron Cactus:   as in any Mexican restaurant worth its salt, you choose your meat, choose your tortilla, choose your beans, and choose your level of spiciness.  The result is pure Americanized, Mexican goodness.  Yes, not as spicy as some. Yes, not as greasy as some.  Yes, not as Hispanic as some.  But, hey, this is South Beach, not The Mission.\n\nA burrito de pollo asado was quite tasty.  Yes, even though ordered \"picante,\" it could have been spicier, it was still good.  Chicken Caesar was great:  crispy Romaine lettuce, spicy pollo asado, and light dressing.  Quesadilla de camarones tipped the tabnels at \"awesome\" - lots of shrimp, good cheese to shrimp ratio, not overcooked. \n\nHappy hours rock:  cheap beer and cheap tacos. Need I say more?\n\nService es muy bueno:  everyone is polite, service-oriented, and just all around nice.  Drinks consists of sodas, beers (both by the bottle and on tap), and some wines.\n\nWant greasy, cheap Mexican food?  Go to The Mission.

Sure, the carne asada was not 100% consistent across the board, and when I first tasted it I couldn't taste barely anything, but when I focused and looked for the taste, I found it and I liked it. The al pastor was even better; nice mix of spices, tender, consistent...I really enjoyed eating it.\n\nThe salsa here is tasty, but in no way is it spicy. The mild is a joke, and the 'hot' salsa is what mild salsa would be at a real Mexican place. I'm really confused as to these people who say they eat spicy food but thought this place was too spicy. The spiciest thing they have is the green salsa they have on the tables, which is somewhere between mild and hot at a real Mexican place. I don't get it.\n\nSelf-serve water is a huge plus.

Warning shot #1: he wrote down my order and my girlfriend's order once for the kitchen, then spent a solid minute rewriting it on a second piece of paper, which he gave to us to take to the cashier.  Note there was no one else in line, so why we couldn't just order directly from the guy behind the counter is a mystery.

Steady, into the breach!!!\n\nWarning shot #3: as we sat down, guy at the table next to us took one bite of his food, doused himself in gasoline, lit a match, and ran screaming from the restaurant down 4th Street, ultimately flinging himself in front of a speeding Baby Bullet.\n\nOk, I made that one up.\n\nFood arrives.  And sure enough, 3 of the 4 orders were wrong.  Plus, I paid $4 for an order of guacamole that never arrived.  My fish tacos were beyond bland (think tilapia sauteed with nothing but green onions) and slightly undercooked.  I'll usually eat anything you put in front of me, but this was one of the few times I literally couldn't touch my food.  It was inedible.  My girlfriend felt the same about her burrito.\n\nSpeaking of the burrito, she ordered the \"small\", and got a \"large.\"  When we asked why, the waiter said, and I quote: \"oh, when you order the small you get the large anyway.\"  Ladies and gentlemen, we are officially through the Iron Cactus looking glass.\n\nA few minutes later, a different poor waiter came over to our table to ask how we were doing.  We were as nice as possible as we ran through our own list of the approximately 47 things wrong with our meal (seeing a pattern here?)  As we proceeded (with utmost politesse) through the litany, he literally started backing slowly away from our table, smiling embarrassedly and nodding.  By the time my friend asked for black beans rather than refried, I think the waiter had backed all the way to Harrison Street.  At the rate he was going, he's probably well past Sacramento at this point.  Hopefully finding work at a decent burrito joint.\n\nConclusion: the guy had been going through this all day and had reached his breaking point.  He never came back, and the meal was such a disaster that we didn't bother hunting him down.

I always figured someone else would shoulder the burden of finding the best happy hour specials or late-night sushi delivery.  I never thought any place I had gone to was extremely bad or good enough to merit another review.  I'm only telling you these things so you will know what a momentous occasion this first review is -- and so you will understand how strongly I feel about the experience I had at the Iron Cactus.\n\nI initiated our small group's Friday evening dinner experience with hesitation because of the abysmal reviews thus far.  I so wanted a local Mexican joint that wasn't Chava's down the street (sorry Chava's).  I so wanted the Yelpers to be collectively wrong, their standards for a newly opened restaurant to be too high, the food to be, in truth, edible.  Lesson learned: heed the warning of 2.5 stars from 62 reviews less than a month after opening.\n\nTalking points:\n\n* Complete confusion in the order line.  Where does the line start?  Who takes our order?  Why is the hot food abandoned to the cold drafts from the constantly-opening door?  How can so many menu options be presented so inexplicably?  The entire ordering  & payment process begs for a do-over.\n\n* You know that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you realize something is about to go horribly wrong, just as you've predicted?  That's the feeling I had as I watched the customers in front of us mill about confusedly at the cash register, attempting to order drinks/sides, correct their orders, or explain the problems with their meals.  That sinking feeling grew more intense as I watched about 8 employees attempting to address the problems without much success.\n\n* The food.  Sweet lord, the food.  Bland, bland, bland!  Lukewarm.  Almost entirely unseasoned and of suspect quality.  As I said to the group that night, I grew up in Vermont and am quite forgiving of bad Mexican food.  I was completely put off by my 6 dollar burrito filled with tasteless rice and sub par meat (I wouldn't even try my boyfriend's sad-looking little fish taco or my friend's \"crispy\" taco with a shell that looked as though it came straight from an Old El Paso box via the microwave) and the fact that I could find no redeeming qualities in any of this food says a lot.\n\n* The mistakes.  I was floored.  My boyfriend ordered a side of guacamole that never materialized.  3 of our 4 orders had something wrong, from run of the mill errors like the wrong kind of beans to pretty unforgivable grievances like serving the wrong kind of taco altogether.  But the final nail in the Iron Cactus coffin was that our waiter, upon asking how we were doing (big mistake, buddy), listened to us explain our problems then pulled a disappearing act the likes of which I've never seen.  Not a single one of our many issues was addressed.

True Mexican food is very complex, yet at the same time very simple and clear.\n\nThat said, it's good to see Iron Cactus in the neighborhood, because it is just one more place to eat around the SOMA/Ballpark area, and it's another takeout option, which are scarce.  The area has Fine Dining locked down, but on the rare occasions that I'm not cooking, takeout comes up short for me.\n\nThe space is warm and inviting, large, slightly cavernous, lot's of rustic wood furnishing, high, wooded beam ceilings, polished concrete floors, complete with scattered tables and a long communal table in the center.  Dimly lit, with flowers scattered here and there, which as a florist, I'm happy to see,  a large chalk board is scratched with the standard menu as well as the specials.\n\nAs this was the first day open, and I arrived 30 minutes before closing, I'd say it was relatively bug-free for the first day,  the service was fast and very friendly.  \n\nHowever, the food does need a bit of work; I ordered the Crispy tacos ($3.50) which comes with your choice of meat, beans,rice, sour cream and salsa.  I chose the spicy chicken which was tender and pleasantly pulled and stringy, but was very bland for a spicy selection.  I expected the shells to be rustic, handmade corn shells, and whole thing deep-fried (similar to what they do at Dona Tomas's Tacubaya in Berkeley) but the shell I presume was pre-purchased and perhaps flash-fried, but it wasn't objectionable; thin and crisp, with a satisfying crunch, but can get soggy quickly from the whole beans (black) and the salsas and cream.  As I don't drink soda, and only drink beer unless I plan on getting laid, a nice fruity Zinfandel from Santa Cruz, from a vineyard I knew I wasn't going to remember complimented the tacos nicely.\n\nMy friend had the spicy chicken Enchilada plate (10.50) which was tasty, but again, a bit bland.  The sauce had a good flavor with an ever so slight hint of tomato, cumin and chili powder, but it wasn't very exciting to the taste buds.  The portions were adequate, which is what they should be, as I personally feel that these places serve way too much food anyway, and since I'm not looking for value for money, I'm much more interested in quality.  The burritos from what I could see resembled overstuffed dish towels, basically the usual-size burrito that you see everywhere, that most people snarf down in one sitting but would take me a week to eat.\n\nAll and all I'd say Iron Cactus satisfies the need and perhaps if they concentrate on the food, and maybe branch out and be adventurous, then they'll get better and will probably do a great business during baseball season. \n\n But I don't understand why any of these Mexican places don't cook with any exciting spices; whenever I cook Mexican food, I'm using cumin seed, garlic, cayenne pepper, ancho, pasilla and poblano peppers and chiles, achiote and chile powder.  Tacqueria-style food here in the Bay Area is so bland and lifeless and tastes the same everywhere (Azteca Tacqueria is one exception).  All of the meats usually are overcooked and the chicken is boiled instead of roasted, the shrimp is rubbery , whole beans are cooked just in water and salt and the rice is always looks flavorful, but isn't.  And the Pico de Gallo which is mistaken for 'salsa' is always made with those pink insipid, cheap, fast food quality tomatoes (as was the pdg at Iron Cactus).  Although I'm adamantly against using tomatoes past their proper seasons, perhaps these places should consider using Roma tomatoes for their Pico de Gallo, if only just for the color.  A bit more expensive, but hell, this is the Bay Area!\n\nI'd like to see some real Mexican grandmothers open up a place, and show us what real Mexican cuisine is like, or better yet, where the hell is Rick Bayless when you need him?", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-10-21"}, {"excerpts": ["Receive a regular burrito with carnitas.

For example, on my fish tacos, instead of sour cream I wanted guacamole and was told very strictly, that there were NO substitutes. Interesting at a made to order place. But the fish tacos were excellent as well as guacamole. And my brother who should be the King of Burritos was impressed by his steak burrito.

You order your grub at the counter, pay for it and take a number. Nothing wrong with that (almost all the best Mexican food I've had was from street vendors), just don't come here expecting white table cloths and a mariachi band.\nUnfortunately the level of service is belied even by the humble interior (I guess they're going for the faux vintage look that's inexplicably still popular in SOMA). It took 5 minutes to explain my complicated order of 2 soft tacos, 2 crispy tacos and a 'dilla to the cashier. After that she inexplicably decided to tack on a burrito to my order. The manager was pleasant, however, and quickly refunded me the burrito bucks.\nThe food took significantly longer than I expected to arrive, and when it did it was savory but not spectacular. None of the dishes were memorable and the ingredients, while allegedly fresh, were rather bland and had to rely on the salsa for flavor.\nIf the Iron Cactus gets competent staff and jazzes up their dishes (or at least obtains a full liquor license so they can serve margaritas) then they have all the makings of a success.

The unassuming exterior belies the soaring ceilings and brick walls inside:  while not exactly \"cozy,\" the space is homey - warm, inviting, and clean.\n\nLet's get it straight:  Iron Cactus is not competing with dive Mexican places in The Mission.  Situated in South Beach, it caters to more refined tastes than the traditional taqueria at 16th and Mission.

But, hey, this is South Beach, not The Mission.\n\nA burrito de pollo asado was quite tasty.  Yes, even though ordered \"picante,\" it could have been spicier, it was still good.  Chicken Caesar was great:  crispy Romaine lettuce, spicy pollo asado, and light dressing.  Quesadilla de camarones tipped the tabnels at \"awesome\" - lots of shrimp, good cheese to shrimp ratio, not overcooked. \n\nHappy hours rock:  cheap beer and cheap tacos.

True Mexican food is very complex, yet at the same time very simple and clear.\n\nThat said, it's good to see Iron Cactus in the neighborhood, because it is just one more place to eat around the SOMA/Ballpark area, and it's another takeout option, which are scarce.  The area has Fine Dining locked down, but on the rare occasions that I'm not cooking, takeout comes up short for me.\n\nThe space is warm and inviting, large, slightly cavernous, lot's of rustic wood furnishing, high, wooded beam ceilings, polished concrete floors, complete with scattered tables and a long communal table in the center.  Dimly lit, with flowers scattered here and there, which as a florist, I'm happy to see,  a large chalk board is scratched with the standard menu as well as the specials.\n\nAs this was the first day open, and I arrived 30 minutes before closing, I'd say it was relatively bug-free for the first day,  the service was fast and very friendly.  \n\nHowever, the food does need a bit of work; I ordered the Crispy tacos ($3.50) which comes with your choice of meat, beans,rice, sour cream and salsa.  I chose the spicy chicken which was tender and pleasantly pulled and stringy, but was very bland for a spicy selection.  I expected the shells to be rustic, handmade corn shells, and whole thing deep-fried (similar to what they do at Dona Tomas's Tacubaya in Berkeley) but the shell I presume was pre-purchased and perhaps flash-fried, but it wasn't objectionable; thin and crisp, with a satisfying crunch, but can get soggy quickly from the whole beans (black) and the salsas and cream.  As I don't drink soda, and only drink beer unless I plan on getting laid, a nice fruity Zinfandel from Santa Cruz, from a vineyard I knew I wasn't going to remember complimented the tacos nicely.\n\nMy friend had the spicy chicken Enchilada plate (10.50) which was tasty, but again, a bit bland.  The sauce had a good flavor with an ever so slight hint of tomato, cumin and chili powder, but it wasn't very exciting to the taste buds.  The portions were adequate, which is what they should be, as I personally feel that these places serve way too much food anyway, and since I'm not looking for value for money, I'm much more interested in quality.  The burritos from what I could see resembled overstuffed dish towels, basically the usual-size burrito that you see everywhere, that most people snarf down in one sitting but would take me a week to eat.\n\nAll and all I'd say Iron Cactus satisfies the need and perhaps if they concentrate on the food, and maybe branch out and be adventurous, then they'll get better and will probably do a great business during baseball season. \n\n But I don't understand why any of these Mexican places don't cook with any exciting spices; whenever I cook Mexican food, I'm using cumin seed, garlic, cayenne pepper, ancho, pasilla and poblano peppers and chiles, achiote and chile powder.  Tacqueria-style food here in the Bay Area is so bland and lifeless and tastes the same everywhere (Azteca Tacqueria is one exception).  All of the meats usually are overcooked and the chicken is boiled instead of roasted, the shrimp is rubbery , whole beans are cooked just in water and salt and the rice is always looks flavorful, but isn't.  And the Pico de Gallo which is mistaken for 'salsa' is always made with those pink insipid, cheap, fast food quality tomatoes (as was the pdg at Iron Cactus).  Although I'm adamantly against using tomatoes past their proper seasons, perhaps these places should consider using Roma tomatoes for their Pico de Gallo, if only just for the color.  A bit more expensive, but hell, this is the Bay Area!\n\nI'd like to see some real Mexican grandmothers open up a place, and show us what real Mexican cuisine is like, or better yet, where the hell is Rick Bayless when you need him?", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-10-21"}], "crispy taco plate": [{"excerpts": ["I ordered a Crispy Taco plate with pollo asado (grilled chicken).

My excitement was short-lived though.\n\nI had lunch here on Friday morning.  I managed to get in just before the crunch of the lunch time masses.  You order at the counter and you're given a number.  You pay and you wait for your number to be called.

I ordered a Crispy Taco plate with pollo asado (grilled chicken).  Rice, choice of beans and a green salad come with the tacos.

The wait for my food was fairly short.  For take out orders I notice they use biodegradable utensils.  You can also use metal utensils if you're eating in.

Sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo (salsa) come on the plate along with the rice, salad and beans.  The chicken was all big chunks of warm, tender, moist chicken breast.  The orange colored seasoning on the chicken was not well defined though and the chicken just tasted bland.  I added parts of my salad, which is served plain with a small lemon wedge, into the taco shell along with the sour cream, the guac and the salsa.\n\nI like chunky guacamole and the avocado here is whipped up too smoothly.  It kind of just ran off of the taco shell instead of staying put.  The Spanish rice mixed with peas and corn was just slightly warm too.

The area has Fine Dining locked down, but on the rare occasions that I'm not cooking, takeout comes up short for me.\n\nThe space is warm and inviting, large, slightly cavernous, lot's of rustic wood furnishing, high, wooded beam ceilings, polished concrete floors, complete with scattered tables and a long communal table in the center.  Dimly lit, with flowers scattered here and there, which as a florist, I'm happy to see,  a large chalk board is scratched with the standard menu as well as the specials.\n\nAs this was the first day open, and I arrived 30 minutes before closing, I'd say it was relatively bug-free for the first day,  the service was fast and very friendly.  \n\nHowever, the food does need a bit of work; I ordered the Crispy tacos ($3.50) which comes with your choice of meat, beans,rice, sour cream and salsa.

As I don't drink soda, and only drink beer unless I plan on getting laid, a nice fruity Zinfandel from Santa Cruz, from a vineyard I knew I wasn't going to remember complimented the tacos nicely.\n\nMy friend had the spicy chicken Enchilada plate (10.50) which was tasty, but again, a bit bland.  The sauce had a good flavor with an ever so slight hint of tomato, cumin and chili powder, but it wasn't very exciting to the taste buds.  The portions were adequate, which is what they should be, as I personally feel that these places serve way too much food anyway, and since I'm not looking for value for money, I'm much more interested in quality.  The burritos from what I could see resembled overstuffed dish towels, basically the usual-size burrito that you see everywhere, that most people snarf down in one sitting but would take me a week to eat.\n\nAll and all I'd say Iron Cactus satisfies the need and perhaps if they concentrate on the food, and maybe branch out and be adventurous, then they'll get better and will probably do a great business during baseball season. \n\n But I don't understand why any of these Mexican places don't cook with any exciting spices; whenever I cook Mexican food, I'm using cumin seed, garlic, cayenne pepper, ancho, pasilla and poblano peppers and chiles, achiote and chile powder.  Tacqueria-style food here in the Bay Area is so bland and lifeless and tastes the same everywhere (Azteca Tacqueria is one exception).  All of the meats usually are overcooked and the chicken is boiled instead of roasted, the shrimp is rubbery , whole beans are cooked just in water and salt and the rice is always looks flavorful, but isn't.
