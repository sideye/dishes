Authentic Italian pizza from a wood-fired oven just like the pizza I enjoyed in Umbria and Toscana.  The chef was very solicitous and sent out one and a half free pizzas to \"try\" in addition to our order.  The first was a fresh mozzerella with proscuitto that was loaded with ingredients over the crispy crust.  The second \"try\" pizza blew my palate away...fresh squash blossoms, fresh zucchini, onions and a little truffle oil.  Mamma Mia!  \n\nThe individual size pizzas are sizeable.  Five of the six slices is pushing the limits of my stomach and I usually take one or two home or donate to my worthy companions.\n\nThis pizzeria deserves to survive.  The staff really does want to do well and I think they will with a bit more experience.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-09-28"}]}
