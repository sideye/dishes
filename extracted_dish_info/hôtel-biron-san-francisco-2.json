Yes, they've definitely got the Parisian look and feel hands down here - exposed brick and stone, wrought iron fixtures, very dim lighting, classic looking bar.  The wines by the glass list runs the gamut, touching every major wine producing region across the world giving you plenty of room to explore and experiment.  Oh, and the classic French nibbles like charcuterie, pate, cheeses, etc. pair wonderfully with the wines - and are quite generous portions.  I've honestly made a whole meal out of a couple of plates of the generous nibbles they have here.  This is definitely my favorite wine bar and is in the running for my favorite bar period.

Mostly European with a smattering of South America, Australia, and US, they are interesting and well-chosen, which means you will get a tastier glass of lesser known wine at this price than paying half more at most restaurants.\n\n* The cheese plates here are even better than the wine, and if you ask they know the menu and are great at pairing.  Huge hunks of thick cut cheese from all over the world and half a loaf of sliced baguette.  A $6 plate plus a $2 quince paste or almond side can substitute for dinner.\n\n* The place is comfortable and completely unpretentious.  A dark candlelit cave off a back alley, there is barely a sign, just a slightly illuminated blue B.  You nave to know where to look.  But what an alley!  It's in the same cluster as one of SF's landmark restaurants and another great but expensive wine bar: Zuni and Cav.  Half the crowd are neighborhood regulars who have been coming  for years.\n\n* They play good music, mostly eclectic alt rock, noise pop, post punk, 60s psychedelia, and European pop, at high volume from a good sound system considering the space.\n\n* It is open until 2AM.  Every.  Day.  \n\nIf I found Biron in any city in the world I would write home how good the wine bars are there.
