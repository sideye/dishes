I got the Fettuccini Funghi and it was pretty good- though the chicken was a bit dry. My husband got the Penne Gamberi and that was also delicious. The focaccia bread and tomato and olive oil dip was a nice complement to our meal. We also had the Cavolini side, which was good but I wish they were more crispy. All in all, a good meal!", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-07-23"}], "molten cake": []}
