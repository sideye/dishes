Or did you think I was referring to all of the delicious wings they have here?\n\nDue to their tiny confines, Hot Sauce and Panko is more of a to-go shop than a restaurant.  With just a few tables available, getting a seat can be hard when they're busy.  However, what might be even harder is choosing which of their dozen or so varieties to try!  Across the board, the wings have come out terrific - perfectly cooked, piping hot, and, most importantly, intact.  No broken bones so far!\n\n-- THE ULTRA GOLIATH WAFFLE SANDWICH with 2 Pcs. of Boneless Chicken Karaage, Cabbage, Kewpie Mayo, and Sriracha Caramel...$6.99\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#mys7NWMtCuydESDXzcgpag)\n\"Ultra goliath\" is right; this thing is HUGE!

Rather, it just felt similar to others I've had at Korean restaurants.  The gochujang didn't have a ton of heat (it's more sweet than spicy), but it creep up on you with each wing you eat.\n\n-- CHRIS'S HONEY SALTY CRISPY PEPPER WINGS...$6.49 sm / $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#HOK0f_hAJ-eKHSWabZQHHA)\nThe concept isn't as unique as my favorite two, but it's still really good.  The honey served as a sort of sweet glaze, which contrasted nicely against the pepper's sharp smokiness.\n\n-- GREEN WINGS - Cilantro, Jalapeno, Ginger, Sesame Oil, and a House Spice Mix...$6.49 sm, $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#Lkn-kGlKtuYBRKCG7edGQA)\nMy favorite so far, which is saying something since I HATE cilantro.  Quite simply, the sauce is amazing - a subtle mix of flavors from the spices, ginger, and sesame oil (the cilantro and jalapeno weren't too potent, but in a good way).\n\n-- RED ROOSTER WINGS - Housemade Dry Rub, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Aioli...$6.49 sm, $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#qHm8ojY5RJrwBWSBFE7s6Q)\nThe Green Wings are my favorite, but this is a close second (despite the cilantro!).  The aioli was pretty good, but the wings are great on their own.  The dry rub is really flavorful and the citrus from the lime really perks up the flavors.\n\nBesides the thickness of the waffle (again, just a preference), my only quibble is with the size of the wings, which I don't even hold against them.  How can you when (A) it's more of a supply issue and (B) smaller wings actually taste better.  In fact, I only bring this up because I wish there was that much more for me to devour!\n\nDespite how they may be pricier than chains like Wing Stop, Hot Sauce and Panko is so much better.

There was maybe one table inside and then a few countertops outside in front of the store. You order and then they give you a toy wooden block as your order ticket. Our wings came out in batches as they were done cooking, so they were always fresh out of the fryer. Each order pretty much came with at least 6 wings. \n\nSince it was already our 3rd lunch of the day (good ol vacation diet), we unfortunately only had enough appetite to try 3 flavors. We ordered Chris's wings, Korean, and Old Bay. Maybe it was just our imagination but I swear for each sauce they had a different cut of chicken wing that best highlighted each flavor. We might've read too much into it but it seemed like each wing was customized to have a different size, texture, and overall flavor profile. \n\nChris's - This was the most similar of the group to just ordinary wings you can get from Bdubs. It had that classic sweet Asian glaze with a sticky, crunchy texture. The wing was very sweet for the most part but you can definitely pick up hints of that peppery taste. From a size standpoint they were pretty standard. Overall, a pretty solid wing.\n\nKorean - This was the closest of the 3 to a traditional Korean wing. They were bigger than Chris's wings and wasn't as saucy. The skin was crispy and it was super meaty, cooked to pefection. The sauce almost tasted like straight up gochujang paste with not too much spin to it. There wasn't too much unique about this one, but it was just a tasy, well-executed wing.\n\nOld Bay - This was our wildcard order. The menu described it as a Sriracha caramel flavor, so I was expecting that sweet/spicy combo going on. First off, these were enormous and by far the meatiest of the 3 orders. I have no clue how they get their wings so big. The texture was so good. It was the closest I've seen to the NYC Bonchon wings with their super crispy, thin/smooth skin that had a layer of air between the meat and the skin. The sweet caramel flavor was infused into the skin itself and then a Sriracha based sauce was poured on top instead of having the wings tossed in it. This was spiciest of the 3 but also the most unique.\n\nOverall, Hot Sauce and Panko lived up to my expectations. I just wish I was hungrier when we came here so I could have tried more of their flavors. Judging from other pics on Yelp, each flavor definitely varies in the skin texture and sauciness so my theories may be correct haha.

It's not spicy, but does have quite a bit going for it. Plus, the jalapeno/cilantro topping makes for a great eye-catching garnish. Within minutes of receiving this order, I had 3 people stop to ask what variety it was. (5/5)\n\nRed Rooster - This was probably one of the biggest letdowns. Sure, the Sriracha coating made for good heat, but the single wedge of lime didn't add enough tang to this dish. It's probably best considered a buffalo wing, Asian style. (3/5)\n\nChris's - Very basic, but classic. You can't go wrong with salt, pepper, and honey...you just can't. This proved to be a pretty good wing to eat to reset our palate between some of the bolder wings. (3.5/5)\n\nKorean Fried - The gochujang actually wasn't spicy and it had this sweet undertone. Add in the nuttiness from the sesame seeds and this wing easily proved to be an immediate contender to the Green for best flavor. (5/5)\n\nOld Bay - Old Bay is a mix of 18 spices. The dry rub definitely made this wing the crispiest of them all and was super yummy. The Sriracha caramel added this sweet undertone that also definitely cut the salty factor typically associated with Old Bay spice which was a nice change-up in flavor.

It has just the right amount of spice. \nKorean was just okay. Nothing too exciting unless you're a big fan of gochujang. \nThai was really good! Very similar to BWW's Asian zing I would say. \nOld Bay (sriracha caramel) was my absolute favvvvv! The spice from the sriracha and the sweetness from the caramel blends so well together.

The same for if your heart should race or if your mouth starts to water as you gaze back and forth.  No one would blame you.

Or did you think I was referring to all of the delicious wings they have here?\n\nDue to their tiny confines, Hot Sauce and Panko is more of a to-go shop than a restaurant.  With just a few tables available, getting a seat can be hard when they're busy.  However, what might be even harder is choosing which of their dozen or so varieties to try!  Across the board, the wings have come out terrific - perfectly cooked, piping hot, and, most importantly, intact.  No broken bones so far!\n\n-- THE ULTRA GOLIATH WAFFLE SANDWICH with 2 Pcs. of Boneless Chicken Karaage, Cabbage, Kewpie Mayo, and Sriracha Caramel...$6.99\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#mys7NWMtCuydESDXzcgpag)\n\"Ultra goliath\" is right; this thing is HUGE!  The batter was crispy and the chicken was so juicy, but I really liked the additional layer of flavors the aioli added.  A thinner waffle wouldn't have sokaed up as much of the aioli, but that's just my preference.\n\n-- GOJU (aka KFC) WINGS...$6.49 sm / $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#AsHq4pEfacu4WHhI_6YBKw)\nMy least favorite of the four I've tried, but not because it failed.  Rather, it just felt similar to others I've had at Korean restaurants.  The gochujang didn't have a ton of heat (it's more sweet than spicy), but it creep up on you with each wing you eat.\n\n-- CHRIS'S HONEY SALTY CRISPY PEPPER WINGS...$6.49 sm / $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#HOK0f_hAJ-eKHSWabZQHHA)\nThe concept isn't as unique as my favorite two, but it's still really good.  The honey served as a sort of sweet glaze, which contrasted nicely against the pepper's sharp smokiness.\n\n-- GREEN WINGS - Cilantro, Jalapeno, Ginger, Sesame Oil, and a House Spice Mix...$6.49 sm, $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#Lkn-kGlKtuYBRKCG7edGQA)\nMy favorite so far, which is saying something since I HATE cilantro.  Quite simply, the sauce is amazing - a subtle mix of flavors from the spices, ginger, and sesame oil (the cilantro and jalapeno weren't too potent, but in a good way).\n\n-- RED ROOSTER WINGS - Housemade Dry Rub, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Aioli...$6.49 sm, $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#qHm8ojY5RJrwBWSBFE7s6Q)\nThe Green Wings are my favorite, but this is a close second (despite the cilantro!).  The aioli was pretty good, but the wings are great on their own.  The dry rub is really flavorful and the citrus from the lime really perks up the flavors.\n\nBesides the thickness of the waffle (again, just a preference), my only quibble is with the size of the wings, which I don't even hold against them.  How can you when (A) it's more of a supply issue and (B) smaller wings actually taste better.  In fact, I only bring this up because I wish there was that much more for me to devour!\n\nDespite how they may be pricier than chains like Wing Stop, Hot Sauce and Panko is so much better.  The flavors are much more unique in comparison, and the food is so good that it's worth any difference in price.

I'd stick to the first two sections of the menu for at least 75% of your meal, and the waffles if that's your tune. \n3. Wait and watch the cooks dash around each other in the cramped kitchen. Send your friend to get water and napkins. \n4. Order. We were only half-ready and the lady who took our order didn't rush us at all, but the people behind you definitely will. \"For here\" comes in a plastic fry basket, \"To go\" comes in a paper box.\n5. Pay - Square has your cards covered. After you order, you'll get a wooden block with a letter on it. \n6. Wait some more. Browse the wall of hot sauce.

It's on a quiet, mostly residential stretch of Clement Street, and we met up right when it opened at noon. That gave us some time to study all the host sauce bottles and finally the menu of wings available. Since we were both neophytes, we decided to split two eight-wing baskets for $5.89 each, a pretty good deal if you ask me. The first was their signature KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) which was liberally coated with a red chili paste mixed with ginger and sprinkled with sesame seeds (see photo).\n\nAlthough quite sloppy, it was quite succulent with the chicken skin quite thick and the meat surprisingly tender. I was wiping my fingers a lot since I was trying to alternate them with the Green W(a)ngs which were not coated but seasoned with cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, sesame oil, and their special spice mix (see photo). I definitely had a preference for the green this time since it wasn't quite as overwhelming, but I would kick either one out of bed. There were about a half-dozen sauces on the condiments stand, so we doused a few pools for dipping. I honestly preferred the wings naked as they were flavorful enough for me.\n\nOne funny thing happened when the owner inadvertently thought we were using the sauces off the shelves. He snapped at us and was immediately corrected by the girl waiting on us. He immediately rectified the situation by serving us both cups of free vanilla soft-serve ice cream (see photo). It was refreshing, but it came in the middle of our wings fest, so now we were alternating two different wings and ice cream before it melted.

Nonetheless, they were delicious - the kick from the gojujang was awesome.\n\n 2.] GREEN - cilantro jalapeno ginger sesame oil house spice mix:\nThis was my family's least favorite flavor but personally I found the golden outside and juicy bitefuls enjoyable.\n\n 3.] BUFFALO - based loosely on the buffalo wing from Buffalo, NY (choice of: hot/ medium/ mild/ hot sweet) not coated:\nIt was average, if I was driving all the way to the Richmond for chicken, I'd go for the more exotic flavors, as you can get regular buffalo wing practically anywhere. However my plain Jane child aka picky eater loved the Mild Buffalo.\n\n 4.] BULGOGI - korean marinated bbq sweet soyu sauce + coated and triple-fried:\nThis sweet savory mix was my FLAVORITE. The sauce was awesome, as was the crispy texture of the triple fried wings.\n\nVERDICT:\n3 stars for great service and flavors\na 4th star for the deliciously awesome homemade-to-order waffle. \n\nWe can't wait to return & try the other varieties they offer (and of course to get another waffle).", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-02-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Korean - A Really really good.

LOSER.\n\nMy obsession with chicken wings started 3 years ago when I first tried the Bon Bon Korean Fried Chicken Wings in NYC. Since then, I've been hooked on the cluck cluck fried crisp deliciousness lacquered with varying tongue tingling sauces.\n\nHot Sauce & Panko is one of the two non-chain shops in SF that specializes in gourmet chicken wings. Wing Wings in the Haight is the other place but they do not do this highly addictive snack justice. Link to my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/wing-wings-san-francisco#hrid:OPQVyk16POSOiQ58lnaJmg \n\nWhat Hot Sauce & Panko lacks in size, they make up in flavor. The store is tiny with a small counter, a condiments table, a wall of hot sauces for sale and two small tables for sitting.\n\nAfter running a bunch of errands, I came to Hot Sauce & Panko for a late lunch last Friday. I went for the 5-piece KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) Wings, one of their best sellers (Green is the other) and made it a combo with a Belgium Waffle for $5.99.\n\nBoth cooked to order, the KFC wings were some of the best I've had. The meaty, succulently juicy wings were fried to a tantalizing crispness before bathing in the luscious sauce of chili, garlic, sesame oil and agave. Since they're non-battered, the wings aren't as crisp as other wings but they were still crisp around the edges. The sauce was a winner, winner chicken dinner, infusing an addicting savory, garlicky, nutty and fiery kick with a subtle sweetness that  set fireworks off in my mouth. \n\nAs the waffle was cooking, the light aroma of vanilla wafted into the air and intoxicated my senses. The hot waffle was crisp, soft and ever so fluffy. The whipped butter along with the maple syrup created for one HELLAVA waffle. \n\nBy the way, they also have gift certificates available for Wing Lovers. Christmas may be over but I will happily accept these in any denomination all-year-round. :D \n\nCLUCK CLUCK WINGS FOR THE WIN!!!! *SHUFFLES*\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*WING SAUCE FLAVORS: Naked (no sauce), Buffalo (mild, medium, hot and xxx hot), Pure Capsaicin, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Soy Dijon Blue Cheese, Brown Sugar & Ham Glazed, Proscuitto Wrapped, Green (cilantro, jalapeno and ginger), KFC (chili, garlic, sesame oil and agave), Gringo Bandito, Peruvian Aji Limo Rojo, Habanero, Bulgogi, Thai Peanut, and Miso. \n*Two new flavors will roll out tomorrow: Wings Katsu (panko crusted) and Filipino Adobo\n*SANDWICHES ($5.99): Fried Chicken, Roast Beef BLT, Smoked Salmon and Spicy Chipotle Black Bean\n*BELGIUM WAFFLES ($1.99-$2.49)\n*SIDES: Fries, Onion Rings, Clam Strips, Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, etc.\n*Catering Available: 1/2 pan (25 wings-$19.99) and whole pan (50 wings-$39.99)\n*Natural drinks like unfiltered Gingerale available (perfect for relieving sore throats)\n*Moderately difficult street parking\n*CC's accepted", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-12-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Am not fan of the popular Korean (KFC) ", "though"], "author": "Lille L.", "review": "Crack cocaine....that's all I can say.

If you are too lazy to go to Costco and buy the back of hot wings and make them yourselves for so much cheaper, this is your place then. \n\nThird, be ready to get to go. This is not a place you want to eat inside (they have tables outside for standing). If you do decide to sit, you are either wedged right next to the door (where a crazy kid and walk in and punch you in the face without you even knowing), or you ware wedged right next to the shelf with hot sauces for sale.

I came here believing in the hype, with the hopes of anointing this place as the chicken wing mecca that others have proclaimed it to be.\n\nThis place is very unassuming, sitting on a very quiet block on Clement, looking more like a random novelty shop since the walls are covered with plethora of different kinds of hot sauces together with a bunch of Star Wars figurines, and there is minimal seating. That's kind of a good thing, cuz I could imagine how horrific the wait for wings would be if this place was actually trendy. The lady at the register was very nice and she delivered all of the food to our table even thought we sat right next to the counter. The wings are actually fairly small, which means an average guy can polish off at least 2 small orders on his own. You serve your own water (nice) using small jars as glasses (not so nice, went back for 5 refills). To the food items:\n\nThai chicken waffle sandwich: Fried chicken is well prepared, with refreshing raw cucumber and pickled(?) jalapenos that gave the impression of the pickled daikon/carrots found on banh mi sandwiches; in fact, they could use some raw carrots or bean sprouts to give this sandwich more crunch. The waffle itself is a little on the flimsier side as it is thick and airy, it would be much better if you ate the mess on top of the waffle as a knife-and-fork job. They are surprisingly skimpy on the peanut sauce as compared to the picture on the website, but thankfully they provide extra sauce free of charge.\n\nPanko 2.0: Their namesake. This order comes out smoldering hot, beware the juices that are released with the first bite. It's essentially delicious chicken katsu with chicken bones to hold so you don't need a knife and fork. Innovative and excellent.\n\nChris': My friend's favorite. It provides a nice crispy texture, a little peppery kick, and well-balanced flavor. It's essentially a much less saucy and floured version of peppery orange chicken.\n\nGreen: A very \"Asian herby\" mix of flavors, unfortunately the cilantro is a little overpowering. If you like your chicken wings to be \"refreshing\", then I guess this is as close as you'll get without throwing them in the juicer with some beets and kale. An intriguing flavor that I am going to have to be in the mood for to truly crave...I'm just not sure if I will ever be in the mood for this flavor again.\n\nKFC: Bonchon, you most certainly are not. For those who have experienced Korean fried chicken in NYC or elsewhere, this is does not even come close. First, there is no double-fried crispy goodness that is the hallmark of true Korean fried chicken. Second, the flavoring is predominantly sweet and almost reminiscent of ketchup, offering none of the tanginess or heat that serves as the follow-up punch in the typically delicious KFC 1-2 combo. In fact, a closer flavor profile could probably be achieved by mixing the flavor from Chris' with jalapeno pur\u00e9e. Considering this was the first order that came to our table, we went from unbridled excitement to instantly crestfallen.\n\nI would give this place a 3.5 if possible, in part because they serve a variety of ginger beers (I had the ginger jasmine tea, quite good) and because the absolute lack of fiber somehow did not result in GI distress later that night. I'm still looking to try a bunch of their other chicken wing flavors, and I'd much rather get a waffle on the side, but my expectations will be significantly tempered when I return.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-01-16"}, {"excerpts": ["We got 2 chicken sliders, Sweet potato fries, and 1 bulgogi beef slider (which, when I asked what it was - the flavor was explained as a \"korean beef\", which didn't really help -- but I was game to try it)\n\n"], "author": "Amy W.", "review": "I think I need to give this place another chance and I certainly will.\n\nMy experience today however was jus \"eh\" I went Sunday at around 4pm (there was no parking so we decided to get our order to go)\n\nTurns out on Sunday they do not offer full size sandwiches... only \"sliders.\" When I asked why, the guy mumbled something incoherent like \"it is too difficult to keep up with sandwich demand on weekends.\" --- So maybe I'm an idiot , but isn't it MORE work to make MORE (qty) small sandwiches than fewer big sandwiches???\n\nI tried to order Onion rings - they were out.

I had to get a little creative with the parking since the kitchen was about to close, so my suggestion would be to plan ahead if you are one of us idiots that actually drive around SF.\n\nThe place was barely big enough for the 5 people behind the counter to work. There were a couple of (occupied) tables inside and honestly they don't look all that comfortable so I would recommend getting the wings to go if you can. The cashiers were quite friendly and are quite helpful especially with the massive selection of hot sauces on the shelf, most of which contains names that reference doing things to my rear end that I often hear from playing against 10-year old kids on Halo.\n\nWith the wings, if you are the picky type, I suggest calling ahead to see if they have what you want available since they run out of stuff from time to time.

The sauce is on the thicker side and tended to stay on the surface of the wing, so there is quite a deep and sharp taste to them as when they are hot.\n\nOn the other hand, the Old Bay Sricha wings were great after they have had a little time to cool down, as the sauce got deeper into the wings. Normally I just prefer good old fashioned hot sauce instead of Sricha since I am not a hipster/foodie/terrible person looking for an ethnic hot sauce experience, but in this case it worked beautifully with the Old Bay seasoning and I am still not sure why.

Thanks to him, this is by far, my favorite spot to cure my fried chicken cravings!\n\nSmall spot and minimal places to sit down, we looked over their one page menu figuring out what to order. I suggested we start off the first two, so our next visits we can work our way down the listed items. So far, we've tried the following:\n\ngreen (cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, sesame oil and house spice mix): I love the hint of jalapeno and cilantro mixed into their house spice mix. Mild in flavor so it's not spicy as you may think because of the jalapeno. This is my favorite!!\n\nkfc (Korean fried chicken: garlic, ginger, soy sauce, gojujang, vinegar, sesame oil, blue agave, coated, triple fried): I love the garlic and sweetness flavor of the chicken with the right crispiness after my first bite! Not bad for all the fixin' flavors mixed together.\n\nbulgogi (Korean marinated BBQ sweet soyu sauce, coated, triple fried) I'm not quite a fan of this one in particular. It didn't come out as I pictured it in my head. I may have to try it again to give it another go. Seemed a bit similar to KFC but completely drenched with the sauce so I couldn't get the crisp texture when eating the chicken all the way through.\n\nten-spice (used 10 spice instead of 5, garlic, ginger, coated, triple fried resulting in a \"pomme souffle effect\") Another favorite of mine! I sure love my chicken wings spicy! This wasn't fiery and flaming-hot-in-my-mouth kind of chicken so I'm still working my way down the REAL hot sauce chicken wings. However, I enjoyed the little hint of spiciness and garlic resulting in a \"fro souffle effect.\" \n\nskinny fries: nothing but average fries. You can't really call it anything special.\n\nBelgian waffle (whipped cream): we had the choice of whipped cream or butter. Of course, we went with the sweet tooth craving opting for whipped cream. I tried a small bite of the waffle without drizzling nutella hazelnut chocolate, boy-oh-boy....soft, chewy, and deliciously sweet and tasty with a little bit of crunch from the outer part of the waffle! Goes great hand-in-hand with the chicken wings! FYI: Free waffle on Thursdays!!\n\nAll mentioned above, this is only the beginning. I'm still working on the rest of the menu. I'm coming back for more! The owner and cook is super sweet and funny! I love their SpotOn app they use too. Check-in and earn a small pan-size of chicken wings after a couple of trips here! You can't help but look at the galore of hot sauces shelved around you! I spotted numerous amount of hot sauces including sweet and garlicky sauces. The wait time may be 10-20 minutes but that doesn't stop me from coming back. Well priced for the amount of chicken wings you get. They're not your typical small wings you get at BWW or Hooters.

WAFFLE. mmmmm. \n\nBUFFALO wing After trying different types of wings, getting the buffalo chicken is pretty much my staple whenever I need to get a H.S.A.P fix. It's not your typical crispy buffalo wing but there's something in that sauce that gives it a nice kick and a pickled taste, which if it weren't for the hot-ness, I would instantly devour them quickly like the cookie monster eating cookies. Really. \n\nKFC wings: A mildly spicy wing with some sweetness because of the agave. It definitely reminds me of the sauce used in many korean dishes and it's finger licking good.\n\nBULGOGI Wings: Very crispy wing with a side of the bulgogi sauce that you can use to dip or completely drench the wing in. The one thing I really like about this wing is that it's very well made. Often times, chicken wings are either too crispy to the point that the meat is really dry or that the fryer was not hot enough so the skin is just mushy, oily and just. gross. (This is why I'm so picky with eating chicken skin.) This place has the PERFECT balance. \n\nHABANERO wings: unfortunately, it seems like this wing has been discontinued but asides from the buffalo, it was actually my favorite because it had a really good balance of tangyness and spice. Perhaps one day they'll have it back up. * hint hint* :)\n\nGREEN wings:  A dry spice rubbed wing with cilantro, ginger and jalapeno. It's really good and the jalapeno gives the wings a mild flavor, which is good for those who don't really like wings that are too spicy. \n\n\nAhhh the best part about this place is that it's right in my neighborhood.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Waffle and 5 wing combo (Bugolgi wings)\nOrder of 15 wings (Buffalo sauce, and Korean sauce)...\n", "15 minutes later after putting our order in I'm thinking there is NO way 15wings is enough for 4 people!!

I don't typically read a restaurant's blog before going in so I had NO CLUE about any threats that were placed against the owners, which is very sad and unfortunate, sorry for that. But you can't blame all yelpers or all of your clients for others mistakes. Maybe think of a solution to why customers are unhappy and try to fix it. Hire another staff member if it's becoming too overwhelming, but it's not cool taking it out on your clients who are not threatening you and just there for some good food.

The consistency is light and fluffy, and it's cooked to a perfect golden brown color with edges that have just the right amount of crispiness and crunch.  Topped with a delicious scoop of whipped butter and a choice of maple, blueberry, or strawberry syrup and you have one AMAZING waffle! \n\nThe place is very clean and the main decor is a wall displayed with about 100 different types of hot sauces for purchase.  You also have an extensive choice of hot sauces to try with your wings.  Being rather space limited, with only about 2-3 small tables, this is more ideal for take out.  If you do decide to eat there, be sure to empty your bladder before arrival since there is no bathroom. \n\nI had one great, satisfying meal and it was a bargain!  I will definitely be back to try the Fried Panko Wings.  Mmm Mmm Finger Lickin' Good!", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Excellent Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) and Hot Buffalo Wings.

Small tiny storefront with a catchy name that made me go \"hmmm...? what the heck is this place?\". Of course, I yelped it and saw good reviews and WINGS? done and done! I'm thinking this is more of a 3.5 star review than 4 though. \n\nTried this place out last night for some takeout wings. Got the \"triple\" size (15-18 wings) for $14.99. Got the three \"best seller\" sauces: buffalo wings, KFC (korean fried chicken), and the green sauce (a dry rub). \n\nI'm not normally a fan of dry rubs on wings, but this was pretty tastiest and the wings were fried nicely giving a nice crunch. The KFC sauce that everyone raves out is pretty good, tang with a hint of sweetness. I'm not a fan of sweet with my spice, but this was pretty tasty. The wings, however, were not \"fried\". Still yummy but I do like the crunch. The buffalo sauce was pretty good, it leaves a nice burn... but it wasn't spicy enough for me. I took it easy JUST IN CASE their xxhot was TOO spicy. \n\nI'm going to come back again to try their habernero sauce, the xxhot sauce, and their miso wings. And everyone raves about their waffles so I'll give that a try too. Update later!\n\nThe lady at the cashier wasn't too friendly at first, but I chatted her up and she opened up a lot more. The guy cooking the wings was friendly and was telling me about the sauces. I ordered on the spot and didn't wait too long. I was the only one there though so that probably played a factor. \n\nThey also have the frequent buyer cards near the cashier register. Cleverly hidden on the back of their business card... I only knew about it because I saw \"freebie\" on one of the spots and asked. For my $14.99 order, I got three stamps. I don't think it'll take very long for me to get my \"freebie\". \n\nOh and last tidbit, credit card swipe/signing/emailed reciept via iPad. SMART!!!

I also tried one of my roommates Brown Sugar and Ham Glazed wings.  Also, very tasty although I would never order them over the KFC wings.  Plus when I arrived to get my order while my wings were ready they didn't cook the waffle until I arrived so it would be fresh.  I really appreciated it and made sure to drive fast and take chances on the ride home so it would still remain as fresh as possible.\n\nThe Prices:  I could eat here every meal without breaking the bank.  Definitely a plus.\n\nSo far we have some pretty delicious food at a great price.  A solid four stars.  But they take things here to the next level to get to that fifth star.\n\nThe Hot Sauces: It's not just that they have a huge selection of hot sauces here.  It's that it is a selection of hot sauce built by someone who loves their hot sauce.  If you are looking for a hot sauce especially for a specific purpose talk to the owner (the guy cooking up all of your food) and he will rain down on you with some hot sauce knowledge.  Also, they have a ton of hot sauces that you can throw on your food to give it some extra spice or just sample to see what you like before you buy a bottle of the it.  Some people I've told about this did not seem impressed but to me this is nothing short of amazing!\n\nSome Other Stuff:  Super nice staff.

The shelves after shelves of hot sauces for sale make me want to come back and try a new bottle every week.

And a serious range from ass-in-the-tub light your face on fire sauces to milder flavored sauces, in addition to classic habanero lime flavors and your tame Tabascos.\n\nWe ordered a half pan between three of us ($7 apiece, easy).

Wings are drunchie heaven.\n-Delivery: awww that'd just too cool.\n-Menu: A little more clarity on what you're ordering.

While I am guessing xxx hot is probably outside of my comfort zone, I could foresee it as not being spicy enough for some of the hard core chiliphiles out there; the ones who can EAT habaneros, but again, there is a great selection of hot sauces at your disposal to up the ante so it's probably an unnecessary point to make.  Not sure if the Ghost Chili hot sauce they sell was on the condiments counter.\n* I would have liked for the wings to be crispier.  Do people double fry wings like they do fries?  Not sure how some places get them extra crispy.  That extra layer of crunch makes hot wings so much better.\n* ok value?  hooters sells hot wings at 10 for $6.79.  but that's hooters =P  San Tung at ~12 for $9.00.  HS&P 5-6 for $5, or 10-11 for $10.  Not bad but they are also not at San Tung's level of crackilicious in my opinion, but those are altogether two different types of hot wings.\n* Speaking of San Tung, they need (if they don't have it already) their version of San Tung dry fried hot wings.  Crackilicious!\n* They have a \"buy 9 or 10 orders of hot wings get one free\" stamp card.\n* You can call in and order giant pans of hot wings ($19.99 and $39.99) for parties or football games.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-08-14"}, {"excerpts": ["I tried the KFC , korean wings and it tasted different than most korean wings ", "but i dig it and ", "the wings were cooked to perfection.

Clearly, there is a reason why this one is one of their best sellers. They top their crispy wings with cilantro, jalapeno, and ginger. I don't know if it's just me but it somewhat reminds me of the green onion sauce for hainan chicken. YUM!\n\n+ Chris's\nFor those of you who like that sweet and salty combo, this is the one for you. It is a honey salty pepper flavor and it has a great balance between being tangy and savory.\n\n+ Hot\nNeed I say more? HOT! It was pretty spicy at first but you get used to it after a few bites. Now, I can't speak for everyone because personally I love spicy food. One of my friends did say that it was too spicy for her liking but that's up to you to decide.\n\n+ Korean (KFC)\nI  gotta say, this is my least favorite one. This is made with gochujang, which is a Korean fermented chili paste. It has a mixture of savory, spicy and a hint of sweetness to it. It was still good but just not on the top of my list.\n\n+ Yaki\nMy feelings are neutral with this one. The teriyaki sauce was great but it wasn't the best. \n\n+Belgian Waffles\nTheir waffles were so warm and fluffy! You can eat it with the wings or if you have a sweet tooth, they have maple syrup and Marion berry syrup for you to drench it in.\n\nEach order of wings is about $7 but I recommend getting their wings & waffle combo for $10.99.

I love spicy, but the chidlers can't handle it and the kentucky yaki were right up their alley.  The old bay were amazing, as I had heard...spicy, sweet with just the right amount of sauce.  The goju were a take on traditional kfc with a little pepper kick that really made them and a slight crunch, despite the bit of sauce (just the right bit!)\n\nAnd, because I just HAD to, I ordered the ham macaroni and cheese WAFFLE FREAKING SANDWICH!  I mean, come on!  It was awesome...the mac and cheese itself was perfect and the waffle had just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Definitely recommend this one.\n\nNext time I will try their kaarage chicken waffle sandwich and possibly (probably) one of the sweet ones too.\n\nSuper friendly service, didn't take too long (though if you are in a hurry I'd recommend calling in ahead) and if their teeny tiny \"dining room\" is full, I heard you can go next door to chomp n' swig (another review in the writing!) and eat your wings with a beer.\n\nThe only sad thing, they are only open until 6:30.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-04-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Kentucky-yaki -- ", "Awesome.

Now, I can't speak for everyone because personally I love spicy food. One of my friends did say that it was too spicy for her liking but that's up to you to decide.\n\n+ Korean (KFC)\nI  gotta say, this is my least favorite one. This is made with gochujang, which is a Korean fermented chili paste. It has a mixture of savory, spicy and a hint of sweetness to it. It was still good but just not on the top of my list.\n\n+ Yaki\nMy feelings are neutral with this one. The teriyaki sauce was great but it wasn't the best. \n\n+Belgian Waffles\nTheir waffles were so warm and fluffy!

It's no where near as spicy as the mango habanero from Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop, think more along the lines of Dominos.  It's has a nice kick, but really captures the sweetness from the mango.  I definitely recommend this if you want a less spicy flavorful sauce.  But besides the great sauces, I've tried a few, the wings are so tender that it blows my mind how wings can be so delicious.  I've honestly never had wings even remotely close to the consistency as the ones here.  \n\nAlong with wings they also have friend chicken and waffle sandwich.

With just a few tables available, getting a seat can be hard when they're busy.  However, what might be even harder is choosing which of their dozen or so varieties to try!

Rather, it just felt similar to others I've had at Korean restaurants.  The gochujang didn't have a ton of heat (it's more sweet than spicy), but it creep up on you with each wing you eat.\n\n-- CHRIS'S HONEY SALTY CRISPY PEPPER WINGS...$6.49 sm / $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#HOK0f_hAJ-eKHSWabZQHHA)\nThe concept isn't as unique as my favorite two, but it's still really good.

Quite simply, the sauce is amazing - a subtle mix of flavors from the spices, ginger, and sesame oil (the cilantro and jalapeno weren't too potent, but in a good way).\n\n-- RED ROOSTER WINGS - Housemade Dry Rub, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Aioli...$6.49 sm, $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#qHm8ojY5RJrwBWSBFE7s6Q)\nThe Green Wings are my favorite, but this is a close second (despite the cilantro!).

Nonetheless, they were delicious - the kick from the gojujang was awesome.\n\n 2.] GREEN - cilantro jalapeno ginger sesame oil house spice mix:\nThis was my family's least favorite flavor but personally I found the golden outside and juicy bitefuls enjoyable.\n\n 3.] BUFFALO - based loosely on the buffalo wing from Buffalo, NY (choice of: hot/ medium/ mild/ hot sweet) not coated:\nIt was average, if I was driving all the way to the Richmond for chicken, I'd go for the more exotic flavors, as you can get regular buffalo wing practically anywhere. However my plain Jane child aka picky eater loved the Mild Buffalo.\n\n 4.] BULGOGI - korean marinated bbq sweet soyu sauce + coated and triple-fried:\nThis sweet savory mix was my FLAVORITE.

So fresh, hot and crispy my fingers are burning and my mouths watering.\n\nI came on a Thursday and it was not busy.  THURSDAYS are free waffle day with a purchase of small wings and a check in with the app Spot On.\n\nSmall orders of wings consist of 5-6 pieces and large orders 7-11. The wings are a very good size, not small and shrunken in like wing stop nor humungous like they have been injected with hormones. Wings are cooked just perfectly crispy, juicing at every bite.\n\nThe menu selection of wing flavors are so uniquely named and flavored, from green wings and ramen wings to sticky pepper garlic wings. My friend and I ordered the lime wings, sticky pepper garlic and ghost pepper  wings. We were very dissapointed with the sticky pepper garlic because we expected it to be sweet and spicy, instead they were very salty and not spicy at all with just some garlic powder on top that we saw but couldn't taste. I beleive the stickiness was oyster sauce, that's why it was so salty? The lime wings were bomb, it is made with fish sauce and I love those 2 combos. Finally, ghost pepper wings, Cheeses!!!!! They were spicy, but so flavorful! !!! I can't handle more than 2. Usually any type of spicy wings like habanero or ghost pepper items are just overwhelmingly spicy with no flavor, but these were flavorful.  I like this place because everything's crispy and even though the sauce is wet, it is still somewhat dry but still has enough sauce to it. I personally do not like wet sauce wings. To go with the wings I bought their ginger ale bottled drink, I had pomegranate and my friend had green tea. It was all natural and very delicious with bits of fruit pieces and ginger floating at the bottom. Definitly helped with the ghost pepper wings.  \n\nThe place is small, not good for big groups or families. Definitly not to dine in at least. There are 4 seats inside and 2 tables about side to stand at. Take it to go or stand around and eat it. Prices are reasonable, around 6 bucks you can get a small order of wings!

Yes, Hot Sauce & Panko was the place that used to serve ramen wings, no I never wanted to try it, though a ramen burger is another story!  Anyways, he was in the mood for something spicy we chose to share a small order of Red Rooster Wings ($6.49) and the Ultra Golaith ($6.99) .

If you love your hot sauce, they have so many different kinds for you to check out and buy.  When you buy a small you're told that you would get at least 8 pieces, we got 9.  The Red Rooster was a Sriracha lime cliantro sauce.  I couldn't quite put my finger on what the dipping sauce was though..perhaps some kind of light ranch with a hint of sriracha?

Since then, I've been hooked on the cluck cluck fried crisp deliciousness lacquered with varying tongue tingling sauces.\n\nHot Sauce & Panko is one of the two non-chain shops in SF that specializes in gourmet chicken wings. Wing Wings in the Haight is the other place but they do not do this highly addictive snack justice.

The store is tiny with a small counter, a condiments table, a wall of hot sauces for sale and two small tables for sitting.\n\nAfter running a bunch of errands, I came to Hot Sauce & Panko for a late lunch last Friday. I went for the 5-piece KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) Wings, one of their best sellers (Green is the other) and made it a combo with a Belgium Waffle for $5.99.\n\nBoth cooked to order, the KFC wings were some of the best I've had. The meaty, succulently juicy wings were fried to a tantalizing crispness before bathing in the luscious sauce of chili, garlic, sesame oil and agave. Since they're non-battered, the wings aren't as crisp as other wings but they were still crisp around the edges. The sauce was a winner, winner chicken dinner, infusing an addicting savory, garlicky, nutty and fiery kick with a subtle sweetness that  set fireworks off in my mouth. \n\nAs the waffle was cooking, the light aroma of vanilla wafted into the air and intoxicated my senses. The hot waffle was crisp, soft and ever so fluffy. The whipped butter along with the maple syrup created for one HELLAVA waffle. \n\nBy the way, they also have gift certificates available for Wing Lovers.

The waffle itself is a little on the flimsier side as it is thick and airy, it would be much better if you ate the mess on top of the waffle as a knife-and-fork job. They are surprisingly skimpy on the peanut sauce as compared to the picture on the website, but thankfully they provide extra sauce free of charge.\n\nPanko 2.0: Their namesake. This order comes out smoldering hot, beware the juices that are released with the first bite. It's essentially delicious chicken katsu with chicken bones to hold so you don't need a knife and fork. Innovative and excellent.\n\nChris': My friend's favorite. It provides a nice crispy texture, a little peppery kick, and well-balanced flavor. It's essentially a much less saucy and floured version of peppery orange chicken.\n\nGreen: A very \"Asian herby\" mix of flavors, unfortunately the cilantro is a little overpowering. If you like your chicken wings to be \"refreshing\", then I guess this is as close as you'll get without throwing them in the juicer with some beets and kale. An intriguing flavor that I am going to have to be in the mood for to truly crave...I'm just not sure if I will ever be in the mood for this flavor again.\n\nKFC: Bonchon, you most certainly are not. For those who have experienced Korean fried chicken in NYC or elsewhere, this is does not even come close. First, there is no double-fried crispy goodness that is the hallmark of true Korean fried chicken. Second, the flavoring is predominantly sweet and almost reminiscent of ketchup, offering none of the tanginess or heat that serves as the follow-up punch in the typically delicious KFC 1-2 combo. In fact, a closer flavor profile could probably be achieved by mixing the flavor from Chris' with jalapeno pur\u00e9e. Considering this was the first order that came to our table, we went from unbridled excitement to instantly crestfallen.\n\nI would give this place a 3.5 if possible, in part because they serve a variety of ginger beers (I had the ginger jasmine tea, quite good) and because the absolute lack of fiber somehow did not result in GI distress later that night.

The breaded wings were nice and crispy, and the sauce on both was AMAZING. Neither were too spicy, but had just enough spice to add really good flavor.

Mild in flavor so it's not spicy as you may think because of the jalapeno. This is my favorite!!\n\nkfc (Korean fried chicken: garlic, ginger, soy sauce, gojujang, vinegar, sesame oil, blue agave, coated, triple fried): I love the garlic and sweetness flavor of the chicken with the right crispiness after my first bite! Not bad for all the fixin' flavors mixed together.\n\nbulgogi (Korean marinated BBQ sweet soyu sauce, coated, triple fried) I'm not quite a fan of this one in particular. It didn't come out as I pictured it in my head. I may have to try it again to give it another go. Seemed a bit similar to KFC but completely drenched with the sauce so I couldn't get the crisp texture when eating the chicken all the way through.\n\nten-spice (used 10 spice instead of 5, garlic, ginger, coated, triple fried resulting in a \"pomme souffle effect\") Another favorite of mine! I sure love my chicken wings spicy! This wasn't fiery and flaming-hot-in-my-mouth kind of chicken so I'm still working my way down the REAL hot sauce chicken wings.

Again, perfectly fried and just salty enough to get the juices flowing... very good.\n\nWaffle - very good... i typically don't like big squared waffles, but this was perfect for a few reasons... 1) it was not sweet at all, so all of the sweetness comes from the syrup if you add. 2) since it isnt sweet, you can add the wing meat and make a sandwich with it, which is really good, and since it isn't salty at all, you aren't really impacting the flavor of the chicken, and are instead creating an envelope of awesome. 3) with the butter and syrup, this is super good...  and I would rate this waffle at the same level as Little Skillet's\n\nA little pricey for wings but given the amount of flavors and specialization, and real estate for storage, it evens out... not to mention they're so good, that I'm glad this place is out of the way... because I'd probably be fat and broke.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-02-06"}, {"excerpts": ["this is a secret spot for super bomb chicken and waffle combination!

It's not your typical crispy buffalo wing but there's something in that sauce that gives it a nice kick and a pickled taste, which if it weren't for the hot-ness, I would instantly devour them quickly like the cookie monster eating cookies. Really. \n\nKFC wings: A mildly spicy wing with some sweetness because of the agave. It definitely reminds me of the sauce used in many korean dishes and it's finger licking good.\n\nBULGOGI Wings: Very crispy wing with a side of the bulgogi sauce that you can use to dip or completely drench the wing in. The one thing I really like about this wing is that it's very well made. Often times, chicken wings are either too crispy to the point that the meat is really dry or that the fryer was not hot enough so the skin is just mushy, oily and just. gross. (This is why I'm so picky with eating chicken skin.) This place has the PERFECT balance. \n\nHABANERO wings: unfortunately, it seems like this wing has been discontinued but asides from the buffalo, it was actually my favorite because it had a really good balance of tangyness and spice. Perhaps one day they'll have it back up. * hint hint* :)\n\nGREEN wings:  A dry spice rubbed wing with cilantro, ginger and jalapeno. It's really good and the jalapeno gives the wings a mild flavor, which is good for those who don't really like wings that are too spicy. \n\n\nAhhh the best part about this place is that it's right in my neighborhood.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Waffle and 5 wing combo (Bugolgi wings)\nOrder of 15 wings (Buffalo sauce, and Korean sauce)...\n", "15 minutes later after putting our order in I'm thinking there is NO way 15wings is enough for 4 people!!

Yelp is where I found out about your business in the first place, I saw the high ratings and the photos that made your food look good. I don't typically read a restaurant's blog before going in so I had NO CLUE about any threats that were placed against the owners, which is very sad and unfortunate, sorry for that. But you can't blame all yelpers or all of your clients for others mistakes. Maybe think of a solution to why customers are unhappy and try to fix it. Hire another staff member if it's becoming too overwhelming, but it's not cool taking it out on your clients who are not threatening you and just there for some good food.

Their fries are delicious as well.\n\nOf the wings I have tried here is a basic scorecard:\n\nGreen: 4 out of 5 stars, as the name gives away - not very spicy in comparison to its neighbors on the menu.\n\nKFC: 5 out of 5 stars. Unique and bomb.\n\nChris's Honey Sal+y Crispy Pepper: 5 out of 5 stars: The honey glaze makes for a cripsy and exquisite outside coating to the perfectly spiced wing.\n\nRed Rooster: 5 out of 5 stars. Again with a crispy, but flaming hot coating.\n\nThe folks that own and run this place are very polite and let you know that they appreciate their business. The free waffle Thursday is also very popular, and worth the trek out to the Richmond for a order of wings and a waffle any day. It was not uncommon during the NFL season for the wings to be completely ordered out, and for them to close early. This just goes to show that they are doing things right, and that the diverse palate of San Francisco finds it to be a \"Must-Try\".", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-05-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Add a waffle if you're feeling like brunch!\n\n"], "author": "Jose F.", "review": "These are hands down the best chicken wings I've ever had.\n\nIf you're a first time visitor, I'd get the first item on the menu (green something) and also an order of the \"10 spices\" wings.

That is if you don't miss it, literally!  The entrance of this establishment is very inconspicuous, not resembling an eatery but perhaps a personal residence or small business office.  However, the food is DELISH!\n\nTheir menu features a large variety of wings, sides, waffles, and sandwiches.  A single order of wings consists of 5 pcs for about $6, but a better deal would be the 8X1 (8 pcs with one sauce for about $9).  The wings are good sized and are meaty, tender, and moist.\n\nI tried 3 different types of wings with a waffle:\n\n*  KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) Wings - A mildly spicy wing (not fried with a batter) covered with a sauce of chili paste, garlic, sesame oil, and agave.  They had a unique flavor with the little kick from the spiciness.\n\n*  Green Wings - A very tasty wing dry fried and covered with a sauce of cilantro, ginger, jalapeno, sesame oil, and a dry spice blend.  Great tastin'!  The jalapeno is not overpowering but provides a flavorful mild blend.  YUM!\n\n*  Bulgogi Wings - OMG!  My favorite!  A dry fried wing drenched in a bulgogi sauce with the perfect blend of sweetness and tanginess.  One bite and I was in heaven!\n\n*  Belgian Waffle -  For about $3.50, this is one of the best tastin' waffles I've ever had.  Not one of the small miniature-sized waffles, but a large 7-8\" round Belgian.  The consistency is light and fluffy, and it's cooked to a perfect golden brown color with edges that have just the right amount of crispiness and crunch.  Topped with a delicious scoop of whipped butter and a choice of maple, blueberry, or strawberry syrup and you have one AMAZING waffle! \n\nThe place is very clean and the main decor is a wall displayed with about 100 different types of hot sauces for purchase.  You also have an extensive choice of hot sauces to try with your wings.  Being rather space limited, with only about 2-3 small tables, this is more ideal for take out.  If you do decide to eat there, be sure to empty your bladder before arrival since there is no bathroom. \n\nI had one great, satisfying meal and it was a bargain!  I will definitely be back to try the Fried Panko Wings.

I've always been the type to keep on checking out new places while only occasionally coming back to a few places.  This is all going to change due to this place.  I am going to eat everything on this menu in the next 30 days.  Why when I have so many more restaurants in my neighborhood I haven't been to yet?\n\nObviously the food: So far I've ordered the Bulgogi wings and the Korean Fried Wings.  The Bulgogi wings had a good sweetness to them that sort of reminded me of street food in Bangkok.  The Korean wings were pretty delicious although I would have appreciated some extra spiciness.  I also tried one of my roommates Brown Sugar and Ham Glazed wings.  Also, very tasty although I would never order them over the KFC wings.  Plus when I arrived to get my order while my wings were ready they didn't cook the waffle until I arrived so it would be fresh.  I really appreciated it and made sure to drive fast and take chances on the ride home so it would still remain as fresh as possible.\n\nThe Prices:  I could eat here every meal without breaking the bank.  Definitely a plus.\n\nSo far we have some pretty delicious food at a great price.  A solid four stars.  But they take things here to the next level to get to that fifth star.\n\nThe Hot Sauces: It's not just that they have a huge selection of hot sauces here.  It's that it is a selection of hot sauce built by someone who loves their hot sauce.  If you are looking for a hot sauce especially for a specific purpose talk to the owner (the guy cooking up all of your food) and he will rain down on you with some hot sauce knowledge.  Also, they have a ton of hot sauces that you can throw on your food to give it some extra spice or just sample to see what you like before you buy a bottle of the it.  Some people I've told about this did not seem impressed but to me this is nothing short of amazing!\n\nSome Other Stuff:  Super nice staff.  The guy who's cooking everything and the younger dude working there are very friendly and easy to talk to.  The lady was nice but not as cool as they were.

I also ordered a Belgian waffle on the side.  It was a perfect compliment to the hot somewhat sweet sauce on the wings.  I would highly recommend it to anybody.  \n\nOn top of that they have an immense selection of hot sauces.

Just this past Sunday i went in around 1:30pm to get some chicken wings and right when we got in we were greeted by the cashier and the guy in the back. I even downloaded the spoton app and when I actually used it the cook actually came out and said thank you. He even told me if I liked them on facebook I would be more spots. I ordered the Green and herb crusted panko and it was the best chicken wings I have ever had. I usually don't eat chicken wings however this place has me craving for them. After I received my order the lady at the cashier and the guy cooking the chicken wings both said thank you for coming.
