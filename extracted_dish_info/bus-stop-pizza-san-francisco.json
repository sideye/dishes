So a few nights later, sober I might add, we were staying in for the night and decided to give them a second try for me it was their Hawaiian Pizza - fantastic. My partner had his old standby, Pepperoni. He said it was good and he would order from there again. The staff was very nice and some nice, short, conversation was had. All in all a repeat food stop for us when we return. Give them a try i think you will be surprised.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-11-16"}, {"excerpts": ["My friends and I had orderd a hawaiian pizza.
