It just didn't seem right to eat it without having the full experience -- by which I mean the injera -- and nobody in San Francisco was making injera with 100% teff. But then Moya came along. \n\nTimes are hard in Africa, especially hard right now, and there is a severe teff shortage. Teff is an impressively tiny grain grown in Africa that is dark brown in color, sour-flavored, a bit gummy when cooked, and is the basis for traditional injera. You can still buy teff in America -- at a price. Most restaurants are keeping their costs down by cutting their teff with wheat, which is great for the budget but frustrating for folks with gluten allergies. Moya, instead, makes two kinds of injera -- one with wheat, and one without. They charge a little more for the teff-only version, which is brilliant. I wish other Ethiopean places would do this. \n\nSo, I decided to reverse my moratorium on Ethiopean food and give Moya a try. My date and I visited on a Friday evening; the restaurant had a few diners but wasn't packed. The decor is more cafe than African, though it is clean and feels friendly. We were encouraged to sit anywhere, and urged to try the ye beg wot, a tender lamb dish that had just come out of the pot and was getting rave reviews from other diners. I ordered it, while my date braved the ultra-rare kitfo. I also explained that I am allergic to gluten, and ordered the teff-only injera for my meal. \n\nMy date ordered the azifa, and I had a taste of the zesty lentils before he began spooning them onto pieces of flatbread (wheat-based, so I couldn't have it). His kitfo came out soon after, along with a plate with a couple of extra rolls of injera. The woman who brought the food set the injera down next to me, so I assumed it was mine. Excited to try it, I took a bite. \n\nA few minutes later, my food came out -- and I noticed the injera on my plate was much darker than the stuff I'd just eaten. It tasted different, too; more like pure teff. Uh oh. I talked with the woman who'd served our food, and she confirmed that the injera I'd tried earlier had wheat in it. She claimed she told us that it was my date's, not mine, but admitted it was confusing that she had set it in front of me. They agreed to knock the cost of my injera off the order, and I wondered if that would make up for the allergic reaction I might have later. \n\nNevertheless, the lamb was amazing. The meat was tender and rich, complemented by the light sourness of the injera. The sauce was buttery and spicy, also a perfect foil for the bread. I would have loved more salad, and was surprised by how quickly I was filled by the meal. I had enough to take home and enjoy for lunch the next day. My date liked his kitfo even more than my lamb. \n\nI didn't wind up having a truly bad reaction to the bite of wheat I got, though I did feel crummy for a couple of days after. Plus, I learned how to tell the difference between the wheat-laced injera and the stuff that's safe for me to eat, so I would feel comfortable going back. \n\nI'm docking one star for the allergy-related confusion, and reluctantly docking one more because I wish they had a wine selection to go with the food -- Ethiopean honey wine, at the very least.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-07-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Mouth-watering kitfo ( I love kitfo!!) mixed with collard greens, Ethiopian home made cottage cheese, and wonderfully spicy!\n"], "author": "Akasha A.", "review": "I'm so happy there's an Ethiopian restaurant in SOMA!!!\n\nWhat we had:\n\nAzifa- Delicious cold appetizer of lentils, tomatoes, onions & spices served with Ethiopian flatbread;\nMoya Special Kitfo- Mouth-watering kitfo ( I love kitfo!!) mixed with collard greens, Ethiopian home made cottage cheese, and wonderfully spicy!\nAtkilti Wot- Seasonal vegetables simmered in spices.\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious served family style on a huge plate.

This was the first Ethiopian I have had in the Bay area, but it is better than my other experiences, even when I was living in the DC area.  \n\nThe staff was very personable and spent time explaining how to eat Ethiopian as well as suggesting dishes to the people in my party who had not had Ethiopian before.  Our sever even explained some of the cultural significance of different dishes.  \n\nThe flavors were rich and not overpowered by heat.  The sauces had a great mixture of savory and spicy, and were not overly greasy.  The injera was fresh and of perfect consistency.  We started with the ye timatim fit fit, which was a fresh and lite salad, perfect for introducing those new to Ethiopian food to the injera.  The vegetarian combination was very good.  The gomen, collard greens, was a stand-out as far as the vegetarian dishes.  The Moya Special Kitfo was full of a great herbal flavor that I couldn't quite figure out.  The ye doro wot was also delicious, and even better when mixed with a little of the ayb (home made cottage cheese) as suggested by our server.\n\nThe interior is new and clean, with ample seating available when we arrived for an early dinner at 6:30pm.

We were led to believe on the menu stuck to the window that each veggie sampler was $9.95. However, when we went in to the cash register, it ended up costing $12.95. \n\nAs a matter of principle, I queried this as it is deceptive and misleading advertising. I was not disputing the price, as the server was arguing with me, but I was asking why they had advertised the incorrect price for the meal. All other restaurants can advertise the correct price on their menu!!\n\nThe server responded that they had just put the wrong menu out, however like I explained, that is not my error. Moya (like all restuarants, cafes, bars, pubs etc) should have the CORRECT price advertised on their menu's, otherwise it is deceptive and misleading to the customer.\n\nMoya, just so you are all aware in the United States, there are state and federal false advertising laws that prohibit various types of deceptive advertising, misleading labeling, and related practices. False advertising laws provide important rights for consumers and competitors, arming them with the ability to seek redress when they've been overcharged unlawfully.\n\nAn advertisement is a message that promotes a product or a service or gives information to the public. Advertisements may take many forms; such as press advertisements in newspapers or magazines, television and radio advertisements or SIGNS and MENUS in SHOPS.\n\nMisleading advertising means advertising that deceives or is likely to deceive anyone that sees it. Misleading advertising may affect consumers' choices regarding what they buy, such as advertising a meal for $9.95 when the amount charged is $12.95. It's worth bearing in mind, that it may be an offence for a trader to advertise good or services if it is likely to mislead and therefore cause loss (financial or otherwise) to the public.\n\nThe server then began arguing that the price was $12.95 so I used an example... would you go to a store and buy a coke advertised for $1.00 then when you go to pay for it, you are charged $2.00? Would you be happy that the incorrect price was advertised? Or would you pay the $2.00 and be happy with the fact you were misled by a false price? When I mentioned this to the server, she became more irate and asked us to leave.......... and  short changing us, we had paid $30 for our two meals and the server refunded $21\n\nClearly being dishonest and unethical is more important than good customer service.\n\nIn summary, Moya;\n\n1. Deceptive and misleading advertising on their menus - prices are incorrect, you need to correct the prices. If a meal is $12.95 it should be $12.95 on the menu and NOT $9.95\n2. Short change people - a refund is the FULL amount. I paid $30 not $21\n3. Unethical business practice and dishonest\n4. No apology was offered, staff were rude\n\nPlease read:\nCalifornia's False Advertising Law and California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act\n\n\nDishonest conduct - shame on you, Moya.", "rating": 1, "date": "2014-08-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Veggie sampler and Kitfo with collard greens is the way to go.

This one is a common dish in all ethiopian restaurants.  It tasted to me like it always does.  There was also a nice little salad with this plate.  Refreshing.  \n\nSuro:  This was a chickpea stew with 15 spices.  It had a great flavor (right in between the lentil and pea dishes in terms of spiciness).  It had a very creamy consistency though. \n\nINGUDAI TIBS:  Mushrooms. The kind waitress brought this dish out for free when she saw how much we were enjoying the food.  This had an excellent flavor!  A good kick to it with the jalape\u00f1o.  It was really good. \n\nI think they could do a bit better job on the decor.

So, \"very good.\"\n\nValue: Considering the quantity of food, it's very good.\n\nDrawbacks: \n\n1) the prices were a bit high for lunch (average entree was about $13). Since they seem to want to attract a noontime crowd, they need to have prices that are appealing. Note: their website indicates that they have \"lunch specials\" now, so perhaps that's since been remedied.\n\n2) Because you eat this food with your hands, they need to provide tableside hand-cleaning both BEFORE and AFTER you eat.

I had called earlier in the day to check if they were serving a particular item that day and the lady I spoke with seemed annoyed that I even called. \n\nThen, while I was waiting for my order, two customers were waiting in line to order and the person cooking who is also the cashier passed by them several times with no sense of urgency and ignoring their presence. Pretty rude IMO...a simple, \"I'll be right with you\" would have been the proper thing to do.\n\nIt's counter service so these things can be overlooked but NOT when customers can only denote a 20%, 25%, or 30% tip when paying with a card (didn't see an option for \"custom tip\") .

As an Ethiopian restaurant, I would expect a lot more African-inspired vibrant color and music.  Right now, it's a newly renovated, perfectly clean, pleasant but somewhat \"beige\" environment.  I don't want to judge too harshly - they're new and probably want to get into a groove before they start livening up the place.\n\nThe staff is very friendly (we met the owner's daughter), and we're happy to have this establishment in our community.
