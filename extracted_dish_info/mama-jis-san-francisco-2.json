"], "author": "Vince N.", "review": "Dim sum before 10am?  Sure!  \n\nSadly, our 2016 visit had to come to an end.  The big decision of the day for me was naturally where to eat!  A few restaurant names were thrown at us from our local friend.  Our only restrictions were that it had to be close to our hotel, and we needed to be finished by 12 noon in order to head to SFO.  I was not about to waste this meal on breakfast as I feel it can be easily made at home.  The name Mama Ji's was mentioned, so I hopped on Yelp to check out their pics and menu.  I was a little turned off by what I saw, but you know what?  I'm glad we tried them.  \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe simple eatery is in the middle of a residential area in the Castro, with regular table seating and a few outdoor sidewalk seats.  It's not a traditional Chinese restaurant by any means.  No gaudy chandeliers, no big floor vases, not a big dining room at all.  Quaint, simple and clean.\n\nBecause we came in on a Sunday morning just before 10am, we were the only ones in there.  By the time we left an hour later, the place was jam packed!  \n\nMENU:\nDim sum items though no cart, dumplings, rice rolls, steamed buns, noodles, soups,vegetable dishes, chicken/pork/beef dishes, dessert, teas, wine, beer.\n\nA nicely printed order paper inside the menus are used to mark down your items.\n\nFOOD:\nPan Fried Pot Sticker - Though they're listed under the deep fried category on the menu, they we actually steamed and pan fried the traditional way.  The 3 gyoza were on the larger size, stuffed plump with pork and shrimp, and were nicely finished with crisp bottoms.  Went perfect with the bottle of dark vinegar on the table.\n\nShrimp Stuffed Mushrooms - 3 big mushrooms caps were stuffed with a heaping shrimp mixture and sat in a pool of a mildly sweet & savory sauce.  Nice and light.\n\nPork Shumai - One of my favorite dim sum items were tasty as expected here.  The 4 pieces of pork mixture encased in a won tun shell were nicely steamed and flavorful.\n\nNoodle with Chili Bean Paste - Yowza, this was absolutely orgasmic!  The noodles were a thick chow mein style, simply boiled, then topped in a thick, brown chili bean paste gravy that consisted of ground pork, frozen peas and carrots, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os.  Maximum savoriness and extremely delicious, and not spicy.  Highly, highly recommended.\n\nShanghai Dumplings - These 3 little dumplings sat in mini baking aluminum pans that were steamed with a pork mixture and were very juicy when biting into them.  Be mindful of geyser-like squirts lol!\n\nBBQ Pork Rice Roll - Similar to a look funn dish, or what I refer to as Chinese burritos.  The big rice rolls were stuffed with char siu and bits of cilantro (yuck for me), steamed, sliced, and covered in a thin, savory brown sauce.  Delish!!!!\n\nSteamed Golden Lava Buns - The only disappointment of our meal, IMO anyway.  I'm a fan of Chinese custard tarts, but because they weren't available, we thought we'd try this as the menu lists it as \"flowy egg custard\".  I knew they weren't tarts but knew I'd get that custard flavor that I love.  What came were 3 white steamed buns with a yellow dot marked on the top.  Tore off a piece, and this thick yellow liquid poured out.  It would've been good but the liquid custard was super gritty like unbaked custard.  Yuck.

Came here on a Monday around 11ish? And thankfully, guess no one likes Mondays because it wasn't as packed as people have complained it to be YAY!\n\nIt's a very hole-in-the-wall place, and if I didn't know of it, I'd pass by it without looking back. It's pretty easy to miss (as someone who's not from here), because it's located in a neighborhood area.\n\nBut let's talk about the food. WOW. I have been disappointed multiple times by people overhyping restaurants but this place was amazing!! We ordered the har gao (shrimp dumplings), pork and shrimp shumai, the soup dumplings (xiao long bao), Bang Bang chicken, and the fried pumpkin. Everything was so delicious, I can't even begin to describe it, but I'll try.\n\nStarting with the dim sum: har gao and shumai. I love both those things, and since they're some of the basic dim sums, hard to go wrong. But the har gao was perfectly juicy and steaming hot. It was pretty packed to the brim with delicious shrimp and was really melts in your mouth good. The shumai taste was pretty average (obviously on the tastier side of average), but the texture was awesome. It's topped with some kind of fish roe or something and it gives another dimension to the texture, which is really fun. \n\nI dedicate an entire paragraph to the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) because I LOVE THEM. I LOVE THEM TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND I WISH I COULD EAT THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. But anyway, the way the XLB is served here is pretty interesting, because it's not on top of the steam paper on inside of the bamboo/metal steamer like most XLB are. They come in their own cute little scalloped individual tin (almost like an egg tart tin). It's 3 to a steamer, which isn't that many, but HO LEE COW. It's one of the best XLB I've ever had. Haven't had Din Tai Fung, so sorry I don't know, but this place is juicy and the piping hot soup inside is AMAZING. The only downside it that the XLB wrapper is a little bit thicker than I'm used to, but I can dig it. Doesn't affect the wonderful taste at all.\n\nThe Bang Bang chicken was WOW. I love love spicy food, and this totally hit the spot. Perfectly crunchy, and the garlic hits you (in a good way). Some of the best wings I've had. Wingstop and BWW, please step up your game (sorry, do you guys have this in California??) Then comes the fried pumpkin. At first, the name was not appealing to me at all--\"fried pumpkin with salty duck egg yolks\"--??! What?? Do not be repealed by the name! The pumpkin is sweet, and goes well with the saltiness of the egg yolk. The egg yolk gives yet another texture to the fried crispiness of the pumpkin with its soft powdery-ness. At first, the taste is a bit odd, but I found myself liking it more and more and kept eating until I wanted to pass out from food coma.\n\nBetween 2 people, this was more than enough and we were really really full afterwards.

But their buns were not nearly as nice as they ought to be: the meat was too hard (the fats didn't melt into the meat like they should), and there isn't enough gravy in the bun to keep the insides moist.

It's a shame to call it fried rice. \n\n SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS\nAfter reading the raving reviews about the Shanghai dumplings (xiaolongbao), we decided to give it a try and give this place one last chance at redemption.

If you think that this xiaolongbao is good, wait till you taste the real ones. \n1) the skin is too thick; real xiaolongbaos have thin skins that house the meat and soup within. \n2) there isn't enough soup in the dumpling.

Usually, there are many things that they are still trying to get right including the food. However, since my partner and I had been to Queen Malika before the renovation to change it over to MaMa Ji's and had tried the Dim Sum and had a great experience then, we decided to come and show support for the new incarnation as MaMa Ji's.\n\nWhat we were not prepared for was the fact that with the new renovation comes a new head chef directly from Yang Sing (known as one of the top Dim Sum restaurants in San Francisco). The chef makes all his own sauces from scratch and has a NO MSG policy. The food was top notch, from the amazing Seafood Shumai, to the delicious Steamed B.B.Q. Pork Bun, and the Chive Shrimp Dumplings. However, if I had to pick only one Dim Sum as #1, I would say that the Steamed Egg Custard Bun is probably the best I have ever tasted -- including several trips that I have taken to Hong Kong!\n\nThere were a few Dim Sum that one could not yet order as I guess they were not yet ready for prime time -- but we will definitely be back to try them soon. \n\nThey serve four types of Chinese teas directly from Taiwan and each one is served with it's own small teapot -- so that everyone at the table can order what they want and get unlimited refills of hot water.\n\nThe other exciting thing about MaMa Ji's is that at night they will be open to serve Szechuan cuisine -- if the food is anything close to the Dim Sum, which I'm sure it will be, it will be very exciting to have a great Chinese dinner place in the Castro.\n\nIf you love Dim Sum as much as I do and want a local neighborhood setting, then you should definitely try MaMa Ji's!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-05-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Shumai, pork dumplings, and the spare ribs are really good too!

I guess its location in the Castro was a pretty good hint that dim sum was not a common cuisine in that neighborhood, but still I was expecting something more authentic and Chinese-y when I was reading the yelp reviews. Instead of that rowdiness and loudness I normally associate with going out to eat dim sum, my experience at Mama Ji's was surprisingly quiet and civilized (I'm only half joking). The restaurant itself is a sit-down environment, rather than the round tables with dim sum cart pushers walking to and fro. What is normally a half sheet of 8x11 paper given with a little pencil at most other dim sum places, the ordering sheet here was a piece of paper complete with full-on color, sufficient English titles of the dishes, and pictures (that's practically unheard of!) I was so amazed for the first 5 minutes because I've never seen such a well-done ordering sheet in my life. I didn't even want to write on it, but I was hungry...so I did. \n\nHere, dim sum is served all day, which you order on their glossy colorful ordering sheet, or you can order from their regular bound menu. We only ordered dim sum at our particular visit last week, but we saw other people enjoying dishes off their regular menu that looked amazing! \n\nJust a few comments on the dim sum we ordered:\n-for the most part, I was able to recognize the dishes on the menu, but their selection is extremely limited compared to a legit dim sum place. But it is reasonable to say they have a smaller menu since their size is a lot smaller and the restaurant does not have the capacity to offer as many dim sum selections as other established dim sum joints. \n- soup dumplings were served with tin cups underneath..what's up with that? Never have I ever been served soup dumplings that way (see pic.) it was just a bit off-putting for me, and ruined the experience of eating them as all the soup would fall out when you peel the dumpling off the cup. Oh, and also, they're tiny as hell. I could eat one in one bite if I really wanted to. (PS: make your own soup dumpling sauce with the vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil.) \n- shrimp shumai was on the better side of ok. Meat was juicy but it tasted a little bit sweeter than what I'm used to tasting with shrimp shumais?\n- rice roll plates were close to 75% rice roll and 25% meat (in our case, we ordered shrimp rice rolls, and there were only 3 pieces of shrimp lying in a huge bed of rice sheet). We did not finish this dish because it just did not taste right with the disproportionate ratio.\n-pea sprout shrimp dumpling: I DO recommend this dish. It's awesome, try it.\n- steamed pork buns was too dry for my taste. Bleh.\n- lotus rice order was made traditional and was wrapped with not only the tea leaf, but also two layers of paper. Talk about really unwrapping your meal before you eat it. Made with dried shrimp and salted duck yolk, which are traditional ingredients, but over all, it tasted a lil bland.\n\nIn general, I do not consider myself a picky person but after reading what I wrote in this review, I am reconsidering that conception. I do say that I enjoyed my meal here at Mama Ji's but not as much as I could have, knowing that I've had much much better dim sum experiences. Also, the prices are higher, with portions smaller, for what I've had before, which comes to no surprise, given its location. Overall, I cannot see myself making a special trip back to this place for dim sum when there are way better places in Chinatown, but if I ever do find myself in that neighborhood with a killer craving for dim sum, yall already know I'll be at Mama Ji's.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-08-14"}, {"excerpts": ["We decided to order the pork buns, pork & shrimp shumai, shrimp & pea sprout dumplings and the shanghai dumplings.

I'm giving it five stars with the expectation that the few hiccups will improve as they work out the kinks in a new operation. Here's the scoop: Szechuan food in the Castro, apparently with a hefty dim sum menu, and a selection of craft beers and Ritual coffee.  Yes, you read all of that right. \n\nAs an aside, I've felt that aside from Frances (hardly a frequent dinner choice), the Castro is a good food desert.  Forever-dieting gay boys do not require a hot food scene.  But the Castro is a food desert no longer. \n\nI came here last night with my dude, two coworkers, and one of the coworkers' young child.  The place was basically empty, and the ambiance could use a bit of work.  For example, as others note, the lighting is really harsh.  But we were basically attacked by waiters, and the dude behind the counter working the beer taps was answering questions and making suggestions left and right.  I felt like the service was extremely friendly. \n\nWe ordered: \n- Pork Shumai: These were good, but nothing special.  But hey, I like good, and don't usually look for special in my shumai. \n\n- Shrimp dumplings: The dumplings were great! They were filled with plump, well-cooked (read: not overcooked and pasty) shrimp, and had a delicate lining.  They were kind of higher-priced at around $9, but worth it. \n\n- Spare ribs:  These were a delicious set of cut up spare ribs in some sort of a soy-like but thickened brown sauce.  Not spicy, and very tasty. \n\n- Steamed fish and tofu special:  Holy hell, this needs to go on the regular menu.  Big chunks of fish with slices of tofu in a light-your-mouth-on-fire spicy red sauce. Very big yum.  Order a second glass of water. \n\n- Stir-fried pea sprouts with garlic:  This felt necessary after all of the heavy indulgence.  This again was good, but nothing special, but I just wanted some relief for my tongue so that was what I wanted. \n\n- Deep-fried pumpkin special: This again needs to go on the regular menu.  Chunks of pumpkin, dipped in I think it was duck eggs, and crispy fried, almost tempura style.  It was delicious, especially after being dunked in a chili-soy-vinegar mixture. \n\n- They made a special noodle dish for my coworkers' little girl who doesn't like spicy food. \n\n- We also ordered beer and wine. I think the wine list could use a bit of work (this is San Francisco, after all).  A nice dry rose or crisp riesling would compliment the spicy food very nicely.  But they have a ton of options for beer, and a couple of belgians on tap that will quench the fire in your mouth very nicely. \n\nIn all, a couple of kinks, but I'm excited to see what this place turns into.

Hooray for some great food in the Castro! And some of the best Chinese food I've had in the city. I totally stand by that. \n\nBoth the dim sum and the wok-fried entrees were excellent. And dim sum for dinner! I don't know why this isn't more common. Why wouldn't I want that? Why wouldn't ANYONE want that? \n\nWe got the pork buns, fried turnip, seafood shumai, and shanghai dumplings to start. Everything was a cut above what I was expecting, except the shanghai dumplings, which were not as delicate as the best ones are. Still tasty. We got a beef with green beans entree, and it, too, was better than I was expecting.\n\nThe desserts are amazing.

The Place is always busy and the reviews were good. I think the owner or someone related was our server, we told her it was our first time so she started recommending things. Everyone around us had the usual, fried green beans, dim sum, so we decided to be different and go with all her \"house specialty\" recommendations. \n\nWe ended up getting Nam Yu Spare Ribs and Spicy Fish Fillet. The spare ribs resembled Chicken Tikka Masala but more brown, and the fish tasted like hot oil, nothing else. Neither one of them was visually appealing and I actually had to have them remove the fish, it was completely inedible and the fish and tofu together were just mush. I grew up in my parents restaurant so really am not a difficult customer and only say something when it's truly bad.\nWhen I told her we didn't like it she told me how many Chinese people go in there and order it all the time. 1. That will not make me like it. 2. I DOUBT many Chinese people are running to the Castro to Mama Ji's for authentic Fish and Tofu. \nWe then ordered chicken Su mei and she brought us pork because she said the chicken would take too long. \nShe still charged me for the fish then brought us a dessert of a macaroon and oreo, which I can tell you, I am Chinese and those desserts are not typically paired with Chinese  food.\n\nI think if you stick to the basics, dumplings, green beans, chow mein you're fine.

You don't have to like hot but if you do you'll really love some of the choices, this place offers some really impressive \"home style\" dishes that are a refreshing change from other Chinese places. A couple of the most impressive dishes were not hot at all, the chicken won ton soup was full of fresh cabbage in a decent broth and hand-crafted won tons with tons of greens in them - biting into the dumplings was a delight.  The rib main course was also rich in a home cooked style sauce that was a pleasant change from the over-corn starched sauces of other places. Other mains that were impressive were the Chicken with Tofu in a red sauce laden with spices but not too overwhelming.  Beer selection is heavy on craft monk-brewed Belgium ales that go well with the robust flavors. Desserts included a steam dumpling egg custard bun, where the pillow of fluffy white dough encased a tasty real egg custard, and such good value with three puffy balls arriving for a very reasonable price.
