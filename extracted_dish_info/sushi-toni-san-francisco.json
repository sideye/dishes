As you would expect, the server was a very nice mama-san, and the place has a family-run vibe.\n\nOverall, the food is good and the restaurant is clean. I would suggest going for sushi/sashimi and passing on appetizers, which are quite pricey and were responsible for racking up the bill to ~$45 for 2.

The fish was not very fresh and many of the pieces tasted too fishy.  Some of the pieces tasted as if they had been frozen.  We ordered a sashimi combo dinner which included 12 pieces of assorted fish (chefs choice).  There were no special fishes, just the usual tuna, salmon, yellowtail, etc.  Again some of it fishy, some of it has a weird color and texture (as if it was frozen).  We also ordered a couple of specialty rolls.  Word to sushi places, ease up or don't use mayo.  I don't know why this has become a convention in sushi places, but I have found that the good ones don't use much if any mayo at all.  Honestly the texture and the throat feel of mayo makes the sushi taste even more fishy and less fresh.  Good  fish should stand on its own and in my opinion leave you with a fresh and crisp feel after  the meal.  This place used too much mayo in their sauces for the rolls.  It was so bad, I had to find a dessert place just to cleanse the palate.  \n\nI wish I liked the food more, because the people that worked there were so nice.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-03-01"}, {"excerpts": ["I order the saba nigiri, albacore nigiri, Hanakah roll (salmon skin, smoked salmon, Ikura), and Swamp roll (wakame salad and spicy tuna).

Not only did the boy and I enjoy some bomb@ss grub, but we did so to the tunes of the aforementioned, as well as Jon B, Shai, H-Town, New Edition and more of the smooth R&B jams I used to bump when I was in my teenage-angst phase.\n\nSo imagine my delight when I walked into this tiny, cozy restaurant right by Union Square and the first thing I hear is, \"Ahhhh, yeah....Give me some good love (some body rockin, knockin da boots)...Some body rockin baby, Give me some good love (some body rockin, knockin da boots)\" Uh-huh. Word. This place is the truth. But five star review for the music aside, this place was a real surprise. I don't expect much in terms of quality or value at any restaurant in the vicinity of Union Square. But Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! (yes, I will refer to this place as such from now on) is both yummy and affordable.\n\nOur meal breakdown:\n\n* Romeo & Juliet Roll- absolutely delicious! This roll is described as salmon & avocado inside with scallops on top. Now I am not a fan of raw scallops, or scallops in general, but this roll was SO good! And for $9.95, there were at least 7 or 8 pieces! The salmon slices were fresh and perfectly complemented the avocado squares. Again, the scallops were delicious. Almost melted in our mouths!\n\n* Chirashi- This is the boy's go-to Japanese order. Always. Anywhere. Anytime. This is his barometer. Chirashi (chef's choice of sashimi-styled sushi atop vinegared rice) at Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! was amazing! Unlike other Japanese restaurants, they served their Chirashi in a longer, but more shallow bowl. Most places serve it in a bowl (kinda like what you would eat udon or cereal out of). Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! gave generous portions, thick (but well-cute sashimi slices) and they put furikake (AKA the salt & pepper of Japan- it's got sesame seeds, spices, and seaweed) atop the vinegared rice. This extra flavoring took this Chirashi plowl (plate + bowl = zinger!) to another level. Definite re-order. MUST TRY THIS, PEOPLE! $18.\n\n*  Nabe Udon- Sadly, $12.50 cannot buy you much these days. Especially for Japanese. That's what- 2 1/3 pieces of sashimi at some uppity joint? Or maybe 7/8 of a specialty roll? Well at Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! , $12.50 bought me all that is good and right in the world.  This dish takes a while to make, so if you are super starved, you may need a starter to tide you over til the real deal. The nabe udon comes out in a hot iron mini-pot. It is hot (I know this because I am lame and touched it even though the waitress said not to). Every bit is filled with something: chicken, calamari, shrimp, mussel...you name it, it's there! Most Japanese places are hella shady about their nabe ingredients. You may get ONE shrimp or ONE clam, but definitely not the infinite portions i received at Sushi Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!!! And the broth was simply divine. Not too salty, but perfectly flavored.\n\n*** each entree comes with salad  and soup (tho noodles will not get miso soup since you're eating soup as an entree ***\n\nMiscellaneous Mentionings-\nThere were lots of 20 and 30-somethings in the restaurant when the boy and I went. Many of whom had a little too much Sake. One table went buckwild when \"Rumpshaker\" came on. One dude walked up to a girl at another table and threw his number at her (she didn't take it). All through this, the waitresses and sushi chefs stayed professional and friendly.\n\nSo aside from reliving my junior year of high school by listening to the grooves of the 90s, I got fed and fed WELL.

The food was really good, but I have to say that it is not very Japanese-y as I tasted lots of flavors in our tempura udon (w/ salad) and chicken donburi (w/ salad & miso soup) that tasted more Korean than Japanese (the giveaway was the prevalent sesame seasoning).  Don't get me wrong, I still liked our dishes a lot (and I love Korean food!), but really, this place is a fusion of Japanese and Korean food and flavors.  \n\nGood tempura batter (not too thick) and the miso soup was right on.  \n\nThe decor is definitely Korean-influenced, tea cups would normally be much thicker so you don't burn your hands on the hot green tea contents, and soup spoons are not normally given with miso soup.  \n\nService was really nice and friendly, and it's an upbeat place with lively music (I hear there is live music now and then - very cool!).  I might come back to try the sushi.\n\nTempura udon+chicken donburi+2 hot teas = $25\n\nLastly, my sincere condolences to the family of the owner of the previous restaurant located here called Sushi Man.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-10-23"}], "chicken teriyaki combo": [], "beef teriyaki combo": [], "salmon teriyaki combo": [], "tonkatsu combo": [], "tempura banana": [{"excerpts": ["This rating would have been lower, but upon remarking that the sushi wasn't that good they gave a free dessert of tempura banana and ice cream.
