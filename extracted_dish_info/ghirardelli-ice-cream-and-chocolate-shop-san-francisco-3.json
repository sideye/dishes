If you come into the store and buy a single scoop of ice-cream with no toppings, you are wasting your money. THE TOPPINGS ARE WHAT MAKE THE ICECREAM.\n\nTip #2: If you order a sundae, such as the Ghirardelli famous Hot Fudge sundae, I urge you to ask for your hot fudge ON THE SIDE. Otherwise, the Hot Fudge will melt the ice-cream, and you will be left with a puddle. It happened all the time while I worked there, and it left a lot of people unhappy.\n\nTip #3: There are a lot of specialty sundaes/beverages that are not provided on the menu. Ask about the Domingo, the Marina Sundae, the Muir Woods, the Seacliff, and the drinking chocolate.\n\nTip #4: Customize your order! One of the best parts of Ghirardelli was that anything in the menu could be customized to your palate. Add butterscotch, a second cherry, marshmallow syrup, dark chocolate fudge, pineapples, and a variety of other savory treats to really improve your experience. \n\nTip #6: For all of you coffee lovers, i recommend you not to waste your money here. Ghirardelli beverages are not as good as its ice creams. The coffee, espressos, lattes, and cappuccinos are fairly average quality and fairly high costing. The Hot chocolate can be good, but it is very sweet, so you must keep that in mind. ALSO, While the brownies and cookies are delicious, they are NOT made in the store, but rather shipped in frozen. They are also VERY sweet, so keep that in mind. If that doesnt bother you, feel free to try them :)\n\nTip #7: My final tip is basically just some of the sundaes which I liked most. Unlike most of the yelp reviews on  here, I have been able to try every single flavor of ice-cream, topping, milkshake, chocolate, and sundae that the store has sold. \n\nFavorite icecream: plain Icecream is really nothing special at Ghirardelli. Id say that the mint and blackcherry have the most accurate flavors though.\n\nFavorite topping: All of Ghirardellis toppings are shipped in pre-canned except for the fudge, which is made right in the store, and because the store specializes in chocolate, I highly recommend it. \n\nFavorite milkshake: the Quake shakes are by far the best milkshakes in the store. My favorite is the seasalt caramel quake shake, but you cant go wrong with any option.\n\nFavorite Chocolate: All of the Ghirardelli chocolate is delectable, but each has an important characteristic. For dark chocolate lovers, its important to remember that the higher the cacao percentage is, the more bitter the chocolate will be. 86% dark chocolate is very bitter, while 60% is typical dark chocolate. As for the flavored chocolates, I dont recommend the brownie fillings. They are too sweet (which is a common flaw in the store). You can never go wrong with sample chocolates. Typically, caramel chocolate and Sea Salt Almond are the most popular, as well as my personal favorites.\n\nGood luck! Enjoy the store.

Unlike most of the yelp reviews on  here, I have been able to try every single flavor of ice-cream, topping, milkshake, chocolate, and sundae that the store has sold. \n\nFavorite icecream: plain Icecream is really nothing special at Ghirardelli. Id say that the mint and blackcherry have the most accurate flavors though.\n\nFavorite topping: All of Ghirardellis toppings are shipped in pre-canned except for the fudge, which is made right in the store, and because the store specializes in chocolate, I highly recommend it. \n\nFavorite milkshake: the Quake shakes are by far the best milkshakes in the store. My favorite is the seasalt caramel quake shake, but you cant go wrong with any option.\n\nFavorite Chocolate: All of the Ghirardelli chocolate is delectable, but each has an important characteristic. For dark chocolate lovers, its important to remember that the higher the cacao percentage is, the more bitter the chocolate will be. 86% dark chocolate is very bitter, while 60% is typical dark chocolate. As for the flavored chocolates, I dont recommend the brownie fillings. They are too sweet (which is a common flaw in the store). You can never go wrong with sample chocolates. Typically, caramel chocolate and Sea Salt Almond are the most popular, as well as my personal favorites.\n\nGood luck! Enjoy the store.

The chocolate wasn't too bad either.\n\nHowever, my hot cocoa was extremely sweet.  So sweet to the point that my throat started to hurt as soon as I took a few sips.
