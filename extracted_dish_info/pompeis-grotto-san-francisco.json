Then we ordered one shrimp sandwich and one crab sandwich, as well as two cups of clam chowder.\n\nI'm really bad a gauging time when I'm involved in a conversation, but it didn't seem too long before our soups were in front of us! They were the perfect temperature to dig in (not too hot, but not luke warm, either). A cup was the perfect serving size for me. I'm not usually a huge clam chowder fan, but this was really good. It wasn't bulked up with excessive chunks of potatoes. There was a good amount of clams and pieces of diced celery, along with thin slices of potatoes. The broth also wasn't too creamy. They didn't give us any oyster crackers, but there was sourdough bread for the table.\n\nWhen they cleared our cups, our sandwiches came out shortly afterwards. My date and I traded halves so we could try the crab and the shrimp sandwiches. The shrimp one came with bay shrimp coated in mayo with some added spices and a thick layer of iceberg lettuce on thinly sliced sourdough bread. It was pretty good, but not super amazing. The crab one, however, was really good. One bite into it and I could taste how fresh it was! The crab was also coated in mayo, but it didn't take away from the crab. Our sandwiches were accompanied by shoestring fries and a small container of dipping sauce (my guess is thousand island dressing). Our waitress also brought out a bottle of ketchup, just in case.\n\nService-wise, our waitress was very attentive, making sure our food was good and checking up to see if my date wanted another glass of wine when his was empty. We pretty much closed the place down since we got there so late and were involved in conversation, but our waitress didn't hurry us out or anything.\n\nIt was a seafood restaurant with good food in a touristy location, so it was fairly pricey, as can be expected.

My wife got the clam chowder and crab sandwich. Chowder had no clams and just bland. The crab sandwich had minimal shredded crab, that did not taste fresh, a wilted piece of iceberg lettuce and was on cold sourdough bread. The more I think about it, I think it was imitation crab. We complained about the chowder. The waitress who had piercings and tattoos told us the chef is getting a new batch ready. I think that was out of a bag, but who knows.
