I had the same thing at Rouge et Blanc earlier this week, for the same price and it was cowgirl creamery cheeses, excellent meats, olives, fun condiments that truly compliment the cheeses (mustard should not have been the only condiment on that plate at cafe meuse).\n\nthe chevre & crostini and beef carpaccio plates were good, but not at all exciting.\n\nwith 8 glasses of wine (a couple of which were free for me) and a few plates it was over $100. say what??!!!?? normally it would seem fair...but...\n\nwe felt like it was pricey for the such poor quality. the gal serving was super sweet, but scattered towards the end of the night and it took a while to get out of there.\n\nthe ladies night deal is great, but the quality of the wines, getting info about them and the food is not very good. go for 2, get one free, then definitely eat somewhere else. \n\ni don't think we'll ever go back, which sucks since we're long time local residents in that neighborhood.", "rating": 2, "date": "2008-06-12"}], "cornichons  olives": [], "mixed charcuterie": [], "mixed olives": [], "warm tomato soup": [], "shrimp cocktail martini": [], "ahi tuna tartare": [{"excerpts": ["As a warning, the ahi tuna tartare is really spicy.
