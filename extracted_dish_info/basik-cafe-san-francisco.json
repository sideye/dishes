I substituted the apple juice for almond milk, but found the Brasilian bland. All I could taste was granola. They told me they use one scoop of acai and it's unsweetened. The owner/manager let me try two different acai bases to compare. He said a lot of places over sweeten their acai base making their bowls more like ice cream, but Basik only adds honey as a topping to their acai bowls. The unsweetened acai that they use has a very subtle, slightly bitter flavor. I do prefer my acai base sweetened; he told me that Brazilians like to use a lot of guarana as a sweetener. \n\nI was curious to try Basik again so I visited first thing in the morning on a weekday.

It came with granola, honey, bananas, and was blended with peanut butter. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!

Basik Acai in Kona was one of my favorite places on the Big Island so I would go there at least 2 times every time I visited. I haven't had an acai bowl in California that tasted like the one in Kona, so needless to say, I was extremely excited for this and had high expectations. \n\nI tried the puna bowl, kilaueau bowl, and banyan bowl with two friends. Perhaps because the girl behind the counter is still new and hasn't perfected proportions needed to make the acai base, but the acai base for our 3 bowls had varying textures.  It was very apparent that the puna bowl was the iciest since there were ice crystals...\nThe kilaueau bowl tasted extremely diluted and barely had acai taste to it. The banyan bowl had more flavor since the peanut butter thickened the acai base and gave it more taste. The fresh fruit toppings and granola on all the bowls were the best part!  \n\nOverall I was very disappointed in the lack of flavor in the acai base.
