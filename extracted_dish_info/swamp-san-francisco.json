My bf & I were both craving cajun food (second time) and it was between Swamp & Cajun House. Last time we were to Cajun House, it was super crowded, hard to find parking, and a bit of disappointment after purchasing a GroupOn deal. Swamp is located on the busy streets of Geary, but I don't think parking is too bad as compared to 5th Ave.. and they also have the awesome check-in deals for dine-ins - FREE cajun fries as appetizers! \n\nThe interior here kinda brings me back home in NOLA because of all the festive decorations they have up. The staff is friendly and attentive. The manager(?) I think .. whoever the guy is, is funny. \n\nMy typical order is always a pound of shrimp and a side of corn and rice. Hurricane flavor with medium spicy (always a regret). \n\nPricing for my order: \nShrimp - $14/lb \nCorn - $0.75\nRice - $1.50 \nCoke/soft drink - $2.50 (free refill!) \n\nI guess for my review, I will let you know what my bf & I do. When our order comes out, we like to dump all the shrimp onto the plate to cool off. After a couple mins (even when still kinda hot), we peel all the shrimps and dump the excess remains into a bowl (provided by staff) and put the shrimps meat into the bowl that it came with (into the sauce bowl). Before we add the rice into the sauce bowl, we take out the excess sauce with a spoon and put it onto our plates, since we have no where else to put it (and in case you took out too much, you can add it back in). Lastly, we add the rice into the sauce bowl that already has the shrimp, and we mix it! Ta-da!! Even the manager guy liked our idea! ;) \n\nAs for the medium spicy, I always forget that I shouldn't order it and regret it during my meal. For my second visit, I asked our waitress how spicy it would be and she said on a scale of 1-10, it'd be a 6. I took the chance and it felt like an 8!! T_T I should just order mild next time .. \n\nFrom what I remember on our first visit, we ordered Grilled Alligator Sausage ($6.50) and it tasted like chicken to us. It's always a good experience to try something new though, even if you may or may not like it. The gumbo ($8) from what I remember was good, nothing all that spectacular but maybe I'm biased because I lived in NOLA for awhile. \n\nOverall, I always enjoy my experience here and would definitely come back. When ordering the pound of shrimps, I highly recommend the hurricane sauce! Add a corn to your liking too ;)\n\nWant to know the inside joke for the poster child thing? It's cause my bf & I were seated next to the front window when the restaurant was empty. People would see us eating and stop and stare or look at the menu before walking off or coming in.

Pay by the pound.\n2) Choose a sauce/flavor.\n3) Choose level of spice.\nThere is a good selection of starters and sides. Other than the usual seafood apps, like oysters & calamari, they also have some interesting ones like alligator sausage, hush puppies, and the crawfish beignet. \n\nWe went with the 2-item Combo ($15/lb.) of Shrimp & Mussels in Hurricane / Mild Sauce,\n& added Corn ($0.75) + Hot Link Sausage ($2.95):\nThe shrimp were tender and sweet, and the mussels were nice and springy. The dark red Hurricane sauce was quite tasty. I think the spicy sausages we added brought the mild close to a medium spice.\n\nKing Crab Legs in Garlic Butter ($29/lb):\nThese king crab legs tasted fresh, tender, and sweet. The leg meat was nice and springy. I appreciate that the crab legs were cut into smaller segments. They fit nicely in the bowls and made for easier eating. It went really well with the creamy garlic butter sauce.\n\nWe checked in for the free Cajun fries. They were a thicker cut, not too crunchy, lightly seasoned, pretty good. \n\nAfter we ate all the contents in our bowls, we were still left with a lot of sauce, which was perfect for dipping the toasted bread.\n\nI enjoyed the dishes we ordered. I have to say I prefer the garlic butter to their hurricane sauce. I would come back to try out the rest of their menu, including the alligator sausage.

"], "author": "Meghan L.", "review": "WARNING: If you recently got back from Louisiana and are hoping to relive your amazing food and customer service experience, keep your expectations in check, this is SF after all. \n\nService: What's that? When we first arrived it wasn't very busy, the 3 or 4 servers seemed flustered and confused. It only got worse as more customers arrived. No one is greeted when you walk in, and it isn't clear if you wait to be seated, or seat yourself. Once seated, menus were tossed at us hastily without a word being said. We quickly decided what we wanted, put down the menu and waited, and waited and waited until we eventually flagged someone down. She didn't ask us if it was our first time, didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, didn't ask if the sky was blue, nothing.  We neglected to order drinks and had to flag her down again. They didn't check on us ONE TIME during our meal, we had to flag them down for extra napkins and bibs which should already be provided because...messy. During our meal we saw several frustrated customers having to regularly flag someone down to get any services. I saw a women with a To-Go bag walk BACK in, speak to a server regarding her bill and then walk away, I made eye contact with her as she was leaving and she rolled her eyes and said \"OMG\". \nI hear ya girl! They also made a *BIG* error on our final bill. \n\nOn a side note, the guy running around in sweat pants, who I assume to be the owner and didn't seem to do much of anything but hang near a couple tables in the back randomly turned on the music in the middle of our dinner, when he first turned on the music it was so loud, we saw several people startle, myself included. \n\nFood: This is NOT authentic. It is more Asian/Cajun Fusion. \n~ They should AT LEAST invest in Crystal hot sauce. It is straight from Louisiana.\n1) Oysters: Can't really mess up raw oysters, but you CAN mess up the raw oyster experience. The limes (not lemons, LIMES) we were given were dry, they had no juice at all. The horseradish and cocktail sauce were in the same tiny container and if you don't like horseradish it was difficult to get the cocktail sauce out, they did NOT provide a spoon for the condiment and we had to try and use our forks....fail, Oyster Experience Ruined.\n\n2) Hush Puppies - dry, hard and BLAND. Zero flavor. They came with a sauce which was tasty, but didn't fit with the Hush Puppies. SKIP THEM.\n\n3) Alligator Sausage and Slaw - This was the best part of the meal. Sausage was flavorful, tender and juicy. The slaw was drenched in a tangy sauce. Good Combo. Needed Crystal Hot Sauce though!\n\n4) Cajun Fries - Free with our YELP Check-In. The check in on Yelp says that it expired 6/30/2014, but apparently they are still accepting it. These were good, regular fries with a spicy seasoning. I'd order them again, but I'll never be back so maybe not. \n\n5) Shrimp and Clam Boil w/ Signature Hurricane Sauce - They should really put down what the Hurricane Sauce is, we were pretty disappointed. Given the name, we figured it would be a blend of true LA Cajun flavors...wrong. It is curry. The shrimp was cooked nicely, not overly done, however we have experienced shrimp much easier to peal than these ones.. The clams were good, but I did have a few that were really gritty. \n\nDecor: It is cute. I like the maroon wall painted up like bourbon street. I do think the other wall could use a huge mural of a bayou, but the small photo is OK too. \n\nFinal Thoughts: I would not return to this place.

I usually enjoy oysters that are sweet and briny. It came with one slice of lime which was weird because I think oysters should be served with an abundance of lemons. There were 3 of us and we went with two orders of the 2 item combo, the first combo with clams and mussel, and the 2nd with crawfish and shrimp, in the hurricane boil (all the flavors in one - Original cajun, Garlic Butter, and Coconut Curry), medium spicy and threw in 3 corns, $14/pound. The hurricane boil flavor is definitely recommended; the sauce is rich from the coconut curry and spices. I loved it. My favorite items from the 4 we ordered are the clams and the shrimp because they were much more rewarding and meatier. The clams were big and plump that night. I have made the decision that I am not a fan of crawfish because for the amount of work you have to put in, the reward is meager. The garlic noodles are delicious and garlicy.

It went really well with the creamy garlic butter sauce.\n\nWe checked in for the free Cajun fries. They were a thicker cut, not too crunchy, lightly seasoned, pretty good. \n\nAfter we ate all the contents in our bowls, we were still left with a lot of sauce, which was perfect for dipping the toasted bread.\n\nI enjoyed the dishes we ordered. I have to say I prefer the garlic butter to their hurricane sauce. I would come back to try out the rest of their menu, including the alligator sausage.

Exactly one month later I dragged a friend with me to give Swamp another try.  They've read the reviews and have definitely done some fixes.  The restaurant was nice and toasty upon entering and the staff was very attentive throughout the meal and that's with at least 7 other tables they were waiting on, also the hurricane boil for our crab was less saltier and more flavorful.  The shrimp is still my favorite as i can tear through 1 pound quick!  This 2nd return visit replaces my 1st so-so visit so there will likely be a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc....\n\nOn 11/19/12, we ended up here after the owner/manager of Cajun SF stole our parking and we decided to ditch that place for this one but that's another story.  So here is the review for Swamp:\n\nI know people have mentioned it's like the Boiling Crab type of places.  In overall concept it is except for one thing - food DOES NOT come in a bag!  It comes in a bowl and you better eat it fast because compared to coming out in a bag, it will cool down faster than you can eat it!  By the time you reach the last few pieces in your bowl you will be lucky if the sauce temp is luke warm.  Now what did we order?  1lb shrimp (Garlic Butter - Medium), Garlic Noodles and 1 crab (hurricane style - medium).  Overall, it's ok, nothing spectacular, perhaps i am simply used to the crab in the bag thing and flavoring so that it's no longer a novelty to me.  Not to mention they're cropping up more and more.  Anyone notice the old Cable Car Pizza/Hookah Lounge is now going to be something called Rockin' Crawfish?   \n\nThe food is ok, the crab wasn't the meatiest and the hurricane flavoring was too salty for my taste.  But the shrimp were pretty meaty and with spicy garlic butter pretty yummy but then I'm not surprised that they do garlic butter well.  After all the people running this place are related to the folks a few blocks away at PPQ!  Who...if you can keep following me....ran/run Perilla (also on Irving) which was replaced by Swamp!  \n\nService?  They're working out the kinks.  Like all new restaurants, they'll get it down.  They were attentive but tentative and tried to be helpful.  \n\nA the end of the meal?  A bill total of $80, including tip, for two people, had me expecting a little more as far as food quality and left me feeling like I overpaid big time!  Of course had we not ordered the crab and just ordered another pound of shrimp, the bill would have been a lot less but then where is the fun in that?  Must have crab!\n\nPS - If you go to my post about the old Perilla that was replaced by Swamp, I have a mention about the waiter who does not write orders down.

Last time we were to Cajun House, it was super crowded, hard to find parking, and a bit of disappointment after purchasing a GroupOn deal. Swamp is located on the busy streets of Geary, but I don't think parking is too bad as compared to 5th Ave.. and they also have the awesome check-in deals for dine-ins - FREE cajun fries as appetizers! \n\nThe interior here kinda brings me back home in NOLA because of all the festive decorations they have up. The staff is friendly and attentive. The manager(?) I think .. whoever the guy is, is funny. \n\nMy typical order is always a pound of shrimp and a side of corn and rice. Hurricane flavor with medium spicy (always a regret). \n\nPricing for my order: \nShrimp - $14/lb \nCorn - $0.75\nRice - $1.50 \nCoke/soft drink - $2.50 (free refill!) \n\nI guess for my review, I will let you know what my bf & I do. When our order comes out, we like to dump all the shrimp onto the plate to cool off. After a couple mins (even when still kinda hot), we peel all the shrimps and dump the excess remains into a bowl (provided by staff) and put the shrimps meat into the bowl that it came with (into the sauce bowl). Before we add the rice into the sauce bowl, we take out the excess sauce with a spoon and put it onto our plates, since we have no where else to put it (and in case you took out too much, you can add it back in). Lastly, we add the rice into the sauce bowl that already has the shrimp, and we mix it! Ta-da!! Even the manager guy liked our idea! ;) \n\nAs for the medium spicy, I always forget that I shouldn't order it and regret it during my meal. For my second visit, I asked our waitress how spicy it would be and she said on a scale of 1-10, it'd be a 6. I took the chance and it felt like an 8!!

It's always a good experience to try something new though, even if you may or may not like it.

Why are all these Louisiana seafood boil restaurants here in the Bay Area opened by Asian people? I'm always a little perplexed by that. They must have a lot of  Cajun culinary talent!\n\nStarted off with a dozen of Kusshi, Washington oysters to share. They were fresh and meaty, but didn't have a lot of flavor. I usually enjoy oysters that are sweet and briny. It came with one slice of lime which was weird because I think oysters should be served with an abundance of lemons. There were 3 of us and we went with two orders of the 2 item combo, the first combo with clams and mussel, and the 2nd with crawfish and shrimp, in the hurricane boil (all the flavors in one - Original cajun, Garlic Butter, and Coconut Curry), medium spicy and threw in 3 corns, $14/pound. The hurricane boil flavor is definitely recommended; the sauce is rich from the coconut curry and spices. I loved it. My favorite items from the 4 we ordered are the clams and the shrimp because they were much more rewarding and meatier. The clams were big and plump that night. I have made the decision that I am not a fan of crawfish because for the amount of work you have to put in, the reward is meager. The garlic noodles are delicious and garlicy. I like to pour the hurricane sauce all over it for more flavor! For checking in on Yelp, you get a free side of Cajun fries which was a nice addition because I wanted to add that anyway. I love free!\n\nIt wasn't very busy that night so the service was great! They came around to empty our shell bowls frequently. One big plus about this place is that the food is served in nice metal bowls, we get real plates and utensils instead of paper plates, plastic forks and food served in plastic bags.

Maybe the spider likes Cajun food too?\n\nThe shellfish menu is pretty simple. You just...\n1) Choose your shellfish. Pay by the pound.\n2) Choose a sauce/flavor.\n3) Choose level of spice.\nThere is a good selection of starters and sides. Other than the usual seafood apps, like oysters & calamari, they also have some interesting ones like alligator sausage, hush puppies, and the crawfish beignet. \n\nWe went with the 2-item Combo ($15/lb.) of Shrimp & Mussels in Hurricane / Mild Sauce,\n& added Corn ($0.75) + Hot Link Sausage ($2.95):\nThe shrimp were tender and sweet, and the mussels were nice and springy. The dark red Hurricane sauce was quite tasty. I think the spicy sausages we added brought the mild close to a medium spice.\n\nKing Crab Legs in Garlic Butter ($29/lb):\nThese king crab legs tasted fresh, tender, and sweet. The leg meat was nice and springy. I appreciate that the crab legs were cut into smaller segments. They fit nicely in the bowls and made for easier eating. It went really well with the creamy garlic butter sauce.\n\nWe checked in for the free Cajun fries. They were a thicker cut, not too crunchy, lightly seasoned, pretty good. \n\nAfter we ate all the contents in our bowls, we were still left with a lot of sauce, which was perfect for dipping the toasted bread.\n\nI enjoyed the dishes we ordered. I have to say I prefer the garlic butter to their hurricane sauce. I would come back to try out the rest of their menu, including the alligator sausage. I had some alligator in Australia and I quite like it! I'd definitely like to take advantage of their Happy Hour menu (2-6PM) too.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-03-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I checked in on Yelp for the free Cajun fries.

"], "author": "Tina P.", "review": "I came here because of the groupon deal because their seafood prices by the pound are pretty expensive and I would say overpriced. I did have high expectations of this place because it did have decent ratings and I've been wanting to try it, but I was disappointed :( \n\nThe server came pretty quickly but we weren't ready yet. However, when we were, it was pretty hard to get ahold of the server even though the restaurant was pretty empty. We were also not offered bibs, while I noticed other people had them on. A few other things I've noticed that were different from other Cajun places I've been to was that the food came in bowls instead of bags, we weren't offered limes, and we use plates and forks instead of the table and our hands. \n\nI checked in on Yelp for the free Cajun fries. Thank god I did not pay for those fries. It was the worse fries I've ever had and the smallest! It was not crunchy nor was it hot. In addition, there was barely any Cajun powder. I couldn't taste any Cajun at all. \n\nWe started off with a pound of shrimp and clams in the hurricane sauce and the medium and habanero spice. The clams weren't worth it at all. The clam meat was very small and there were even some that were empty. The shrimp wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. The shell was stuck to the shrimp pretty well, so it was hard to peel. \n\nAs for the hurricane sauce, I am not the biggest fan of coconut curry, so it didn't come as a surprise that I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauce. It wasn't bad, but I prefer the house sauces at Cajun House and Boiling Crab. I don't really like the sweetness of it, so I probably should've tried the garlic sauce instead. Not to mention, there wasn't enough garlic in the sauce like I would normally expect.\n\nWe were still hungry so we decided to order another pound of shrimp and to try the garlic noodles. My mom told me not to because it's easily made and pretty expensive but since there were so many reviews about it, I thought I should. Man did I regret it. The bowl of garlic noodles came in a smaller bowl than the shrimp! My mom thought it would be oily because it would be made with butter but it barely had any at all. Normally that would be good, but this meant that the noodles had no flavor! I could barely see any garlic and you couldn't taste the garlic much either. The garlic hadn't been cooked to the point where the flavor had all come out yet or there just wasn't enough. I wished I had gotten something else instead....\n\nLastly, when I was about to use the groupon deal I found out I couldn't use the $50 value one because we didn't have four people, so we ended up paying an extra 30 instead. I guess it was my fault that I misunderstood the terms when it said dinner for 4 but I had just thought that it meant that the food was enough to fill four people...I mean if 2 people are eating $50 worth, doesn't that mean each person is paying more? That should be better for the business right? Well apparently not. If I had known ahead of time, we wouldn't have ordered the second pound of shrimp and the garlic noodles, especially since the groupon wasn't saving us that much to begin with. \n\nIn conclusion, I probably wouldn't come back here again. The groupon is a good deal but $25 can't get you much food and definitely not enough for two people to be full. I don't particularly like the sauce either and definitely not the fries and noodles. Both my mom and I have agreed that we prefer Cajun House in terms of sauce, portion, freshness, service, and noodles! Of course, my favorite will always be Boiling Crab, but that's considerably further.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Cajun Fries - Free with our YELP Check-In.

When we first arrived it wasn't very busy, the 3 or 4 servers seemed flustered and confused. It only got worse as more customers arrived. No one is greeted when you walk in, and it isn't clear if you wait to be seated, or seat yourself. Once seated, menus were tossed at us hastily without a word being said. We quickly decided what we wanted, put down the menu and waited, and waited and waited until we eventually flagged someone down. She didn't ask us if it was our first time, didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, didn't ask if the sky was blue, nothing.  We neglected to order drinks and had to flag her down again. They didn't check on us ONE TIME during our meal, we had to flag them down for extra napkins and bibs which should already be provided because...messy. During our meal we saw several frustrated customers having to regularly flag someone down to get any services. I saw a women with a To-Go bag walk BACK in, speak to a server regarding her bill and then walk away, I made eye contact with her as she was leaving and she rolled her eyes and said \"OMG\". \nI hear ya girl!

It is more Asian/Cajun Fusion. \n~ They should AT LEAST invest in Crystal hot sauce. It is straight from Louisiana.\n1) Oysters: Can't really mess up raw oysters, but you CAN mess up the raw oyster experience. The limes (not lemons, LIMES) we were given were dry, they had no juice at all. The horseradish and cocktail sauce were in the same tiny container and if you don't like horseradish it was difficult to get the cocktail sauce out, they did NOT provide a spoon for the condiment and we had to try and use our forks....fail, Oyster Experience Ruined.\n\n2) Hush Puppies - dry, hard and BLAND. Zero flavor. They came with a sauce which was tasty, but didn't fit with the Hush Puppies. SKIP THEM.\n\n3) Alligator Sausage and Slaw - This was the best part of the meal. Sausage was flavorful, tender and juicy. The slaw was drenched in a tangy sauce. Good Combo. Needed Crystal Hot Sauce though!\n\n4) Cajun Fries - Free with our YELP Check-In. The check in on Yelp says that it expired 6/30/2014, but apparently they are still accepting it. These were good, regular fries with a spicy seasoning. I'd order them again, but I'll never be back so maybe not. \n\n5) Shrimp and Clam Boil w/ Signature Hurricane Sauce - They should really put down what the Hurricane Sauce is, we were pretty disappointed. Given the name, we figured it would be a blend of true LA Cajun flavors...wrong. It is curry. The shrimp was cooked nicely, not overly done, however we have experienced shrimp much easier to peal than these ones.. The clams were good, but I did have a few that were really gritty. \n\nDecor: It is cute. I like the maroon wall painted up like bourbon street.

I liked that at the end of the meal, they gave us a hot towelette; makes the bathroom trip afterwards a lot cleaner as far as touching the handles and what not. \n\nTaste: \nFor appetizers, we ordered the cajun calamari, cajun wings, and got a free cajun fries by checking in on Yelp. The calamari was pretty good, it had like a curly fries taste to it and they were really crispy. The cajun wings were meh... I thought they were going to be dry rubbed sort of wings, but they are really saucy. I am guessing the sauce is their hurricane sauce. I was not digging all the sauce on the wing, although it was okay tasting. Imagine the shrimp sauce on a wing? The fries were really good. They're perfectly crispy and seasoned; comparable to the Boiling Crab ones. \n\nWe also ordered 1 lb of mild shrimp in the hurricane sauce with one corn. Shrimp was so friggen hot, so be careful when you start peeling them. Shrimp was pretty good. Sauce is on the thicker side, but still tasty. \n\nThe bill came out to $60 after tax and tip (bf ordered a lb and 2 corns togo) (before that the total was around $35). I was surprised to see that a lb of shrimp costs $15. I am used to paying ~$10 at boiling crab, so the price kind of shocked me. Overall the food was good.

When our order comes out, we like to dump all the shrimp onto the plate to cool off. After a couple mins (even when still kinda hot), we peel all the shrimps and dump the excess remains into a bowl (provided by staff) and put the shrimps meat into the bowl that it came with (into the sauce bowl). Before we add the rice into the sauce bowl, we take out the excess sauce with a spoon and put it onto our plates, since we have no where else to put it (and in case you took out too much, you can add it back in). Lastly, we add the rice into the sauce bowl that already has the shrimp, and we mix it! Ta-da!! Even the manager guy liked our idea! ;) \n\nAs for the medium spicy, I always forget that I shouldn't order it and regret it during my meal.

The seafood comes in metal bowls and they give you empty bowls to put the shells which is nice so you don't a mess make everywhere. It took awhile to peel the seafood because it was scorching hot, but we were hungry so we fought through the heat to peel them. My fianc\u00e9s' one pound shrimp had about 10-12 shrimps in there and I had 6-7 shrimps and 9 crawfish. We managed to eat everything in sight and was pretty satisfied and full. \n\nOverall, I have a bias because I compare all seafood places to Boiling Crab and this restaurant is decent, but not as good as boiling crab. I personally don't like curry sauce in my seafood so that's why they lost a star for me and as the prices for boiling crab is cheaper than Swamp.

This was my first time going here. \n\nThe service from the waiter (possibly the guy running the place) is deplorable and combative. \n\nFood: We had a prawn and shrimp boil with cajun seasoning. The prawn were undersized, but my wife really liked them as they had good flavor. The shrimp (whole and with veins) was good sized and tasted fresh. The watermelon iced tea was nearly undrinkable. The cajun fries were OK, but not spectacular as it was difficult to taste the seasoning.  If you ask for more ketchup, they'll bring the bottle over and squirt some into the small ketchup dish instead of giving you the bottle. \n\nService: Based on the service within only the first few moments of walking in the door, I was ready to walk out of the door. A few simple correspondences as a guest of the establishment shouldn't get your blood boiling and discomfort level up. For the quick and dirty on the place, you can stop here, if you are interested in knowing what happened, I've outlined the 4 painful experiences below. \n\nUnfortunately tone and volume are not yet transmissible via text, so you will need to imagine a very loud and angry guy who can make people uncomfortable with simple words. There were at least 5-6 witnesses (which is what I believe they should be termed in this type of situation) in the restaurant. \n\n#1 - Taken Aback: Walked in and the place was at about 20% capacity. The guy said \"can I help you\" from all the way across the restaurant which is a strange way to greet people.  Being that it was my first time here, I also walked in with that normal level of social anxiety of not knowing where to sit.  I responded in a joking manner that we're just trying to find a place to sit.  The guy told me that you don't choose, he will seat you himself.  Taken aback, I jested that there should be a sign if that is the case, but he said that they don't need a sign since he just tells people where to sit.... This went on for a demeaning 30-40 seconds. \n\n#2 - The Jab: They give you two menus, one of them has all the main seafood and one has drinks & lunch specials.  Outside the door they have a sign advertising Po-Boy sandwiches, this doesn't appear to be dependent on the time of day.  Not finding the Po-Boy on the regular menu, my wife found it on the lunch special page.  I asked if it is possible to get a poor boy at this time (after the end of lunch specials), the guy told me he could give it to me, but it wouldn't be at the happy hour price. I was fine with this pricing fact.. I guess.. but the way he said it was very rude and condescending. I would think that it's either on the menu or not (especially when it's on the sign outside and plastered in ads on the window). \n\n#3 - On the Ropes: We happened to have a Yelp coupon for free cajun fries.  I'm a scaredy cat, so after #1 & #2, I asked my wife to present the coupon to the guy.  She showed the coupon which still needed a few clicks to complete the transaction.  The guy very curtly said to her to click \"this\" now \"that\" now \"this.\"  I don't recall the commands on the phone, but basically instead of saying, OK, you just need to click through these steps, he elevated everyone's blood pressure in the room by using a high volume to spew the commands at her. Sometimes an economy of words with people can seem so much ruder...\n\n#4 - The Death Blow:  The menu for the seafood boils have prices by the pound.  We ordered a combo shirimp/prawn at about $14/lb, but didn't exactly say how many pounds and the guy didn't ask.  After ordering, and given the awful experience so far, I did start to worry that perhaps the default might be more than a pound, so I asked my wife to confirm with the guy when she walked back from washing her hands.  She asked the guy on her way back, and the guy got very loud and confrontational to explain how the menu works and that if you order the combo, it is simply $14.  She said that she was just worried because we didn't say one way or another and the price is in per pound increments.  The guy said he doesn't need to ask since it just is $14. She explained that it's our first time here so we didn't know how it works.  Disregarding this comment, the guy then \"went over her head\" and came over to me to explain how the menu works.  I told him that we just weren't sure and wanted to make sure and that I was the one who actually had the question.  He failed to grasp the situation and his handling was quite rude - particularly trying to go over my wife's head as though I could somehow explain his specious argument to her (if you've ever ordered something on a menu listed as market price, you know that you had better double check prices first!). \n\nP.S. Luckily he disappeared 20 minutes into our experience, so we were able to let our guard down and try to enjoy our meal on an otherwise nice Friday afternoon.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered the alligator sausage, cajun fries, garlic noodles, 1 lb of shrimp (hurricane medium spicy), and 1 lb of mussels. \n\n", "The cajun fries needed to be crunchier/crispier and were steak-cut which I don't prefer.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, I was quite surprised that it was not the typical generic boiling crab decorations with the wooden pillars and fish nets. Instead, there was a stand with an assortment of seafood laid out for decoration near the entrance, Marci gras mask and beads amidst red walls. In the back of the restaurant, there is  a mini bar.  \n\nWe ordered the kusshi/washington oysters for $18 and those were fresh and briny. \n  \nThere were four flavors : original cajun, garlic butter, lemon butter, and hurricane (the combination of everything) in either no spice, mild, medium, and spicy habanero. My rule of thumb is to always choose the second to spiciest as I usually can take most spices. Next, we choose however much pound of seafood amongst shrimp, mussels, clams, crawfish, and so on. Crawfishes and shrimps are about 12 dollars a pound. I ordered a pound of medium crawfish in the hurricane flavor with a corn thrown in. If you check-in, you get a free side of cajun fries. They were pretty fresh and crispy fries. Once the order came, the crawfishes were very fresh and succulent. Sizes range from small to medium. I would not suggest getting the corn.

I came with a friend... not expecting much since the city doesn't have much to offer compared to places in San Jose. BUT OMG! It may not be as good as boiling crab or other places, but it's definitely, in my opinion, the best place so far in San Francisco. Assuming that everything stays the same and the seafood stays fresh, then I won't have to be making my long journeys to San Jose anymore... or as much at least! And guess what!??!! They offer UNLIMITED soda refills!!!! Unlike other Cajun places in the city, they give you just can soda which you have to pay for each one. Being a soda lover myself, I love that it's free refills here!\n\nOkay, onto the food! Ordered 1lb of crawfish, mild hurricane. Nice little kick but very flavorful. Some of the crawfish were tiny though, while some was average sized. I guess it's not their fault, they should consider another vendor of crawfish though. Ordered 2lbs of shrimp, mild hurricane again. Again, very flavorful. Eat it fast because near the end, I guess we let the shrimp soak too long in the sauce (which is pretty hot) so it overcooked the shrimp... so it became chewy in the end. The only sad thing was that they didn't give limes and salt/pepper for you to squeeze and dip into. I'm not sure if it's going to be like that forever or if it's just now... but I hope they consider offering that. Cajun fries was free with checkin on yelp, so woot woot (free.... they just know how to draw me in). Nice and hot, and tasty. The only thing I didn't care too much for during the meal was the garlic noodles. The noodles were like they left it out too long so they all were stuck to each other... also needed more of that garlic flavor or whatever they need to make it taste like garlic noodles. \n\nService was excellent, always brought us more napkins, checked on us a few times, and the guy kept refilling my water without me having to ask (then again, it wasn't too busy... so I don't know how they would do if it were busy though). Place is pretty clean and the restrooms seem pretty well maintained. Oh, and they don't serve their food out of plastic bags! At first it didn't seem the same... but I guess it's better since you don't know what kind of chemicals may be leeching from the plastic into your food! Overall, I'm happy that there is finally ONE good Cajun place in San Francisco!

"], "author": "Brian L.", "review": "The main dish here came through and my wife is hoping to go back again.  This was my first time going here. \n\nThe service from the waiter (possibly the guy running the place) is deplorable and combative. \n\nFood: We had a prawn and shrimp boil with cajun seasoning. The prawn were undersized, but my wife really liked them as they had good flavor. The shrimp (whole and with veins) was good sized and tasted fresh. The watermelon iced tea was nearly undrinkable. The cajun fries were OK, but not spectacular as it was difficult to taste the seasoning.  If you ask for more ketchup, they'll bring the bottle over and squirt some into the small ketchup dish instead of giving you the bottle. \n\nService: Based on the service within only the first few moments of walking in the door, I was ready to walk out of the door. A few simple correspondences as a guest of the establishment shouldn't get your blood boiling and discomfort level up. For the quick and dirty on the place, you can stop here, if you are interested in knowing what happened, I've outlined the 4 painful experiences below. \n\nUnfortunately tone and volume are not yet transmissible via text, so you will need to imagine a very loud and angry guy who can make people uncomfortable with simple words. There were at least 5-6 witnesses (which is what I believe they should be termed in this type of situation) in the restaurant. \n\n#1 - Taken Aback: Walked in and the place was at about 20% capacity. The guy said \"can I help you\" from all the way across the restaurant which is a strange way to greet people.  Being that it was my first time here, I also walked in with that normal level of social anxiety of not knowing where to sit.  I responded in a joking manner that we're just trying to find a place to sit.  The guy told me that you don't choose, he will seat you himself.  Taken aback, I jested that there should be a sign if that is the case, but he said that they don't need a sign since he just tells people where to sit.... This went on for a demeaning 30-40 seconds. \n\n#2 - The Jab: They give you two menus, one of them has all the main seafood and one has drinks & lunch specials.  Outside the door they have a sign advertising Po-Boy sandwiches, this doesn't appear to be dependent on the time of day.  Not finding the Po-Boy on the regular menu, my wife found it on the lunch special page.  I asked if it is possible to get a poor boy at this time (after the end of lunch specials), the guy told me he could give it to me, but it wouldn't be at the happy hour price. I was fine with this pricing fact.. I guess.. but the way he said it was very rude and condescending. I would think that it's either on the menu or not (especially when it's on the sign outside and plastered in ads on the window). \n\n#3 - On the Ropes: We happened to have a Yelp coupon for free cajun fries.  I'm a scaredy cat, so after #1 & #2, I asked my wife to present the coupon to the guy.  She showed the coupon which still needed a few clicks to complete the transaction.  The guy very curtly said to her to click \"this\" now \"that\" now \"this.\"  I don't recall the commands on the phone, but basically instead of saying, OK, you just need to click through these steps, he elevated everyone's blood pressure in the room by using a high volume to spew the commands at her. Sometimes an economy of words with people can seem so much ruder...\n\n#4 - The Death Blow:  The menu for the seafood boils have prices by the pound.  We ordered a combo shirimp/prawn at about $14/lb, but didn't exactly say how many pounds and the guy didn't ask.  After ordering, and given the awful experience so far, I did start to worry that perhaps the default might be more than a pound, so I asked my wife to confirm with the guy when she walked back from washing her hands.  She asked the guy on her way back, and the guy got very loud and confrontational to explain how the menu works and that if you order the combo, it is simply $14.  She said that she was just worried because we didn't say one way or another and the price is in per pound increments.  The guy said he doesn't need to ask since it just is $14. She explained that it's our first time here so we didn't know how it works.  Disregarding this comment, the guy then \"went over her head\" and came over to me to explain how the menu works.  I told him that we just weren't sure and wanted to make sure and that I was the one who actually had the question.  He failed to grasp the situation and his handling was quite rude - particularly trying to go over my wife's head as though I could somehow explain his specious argument to her (if you've ever ordered something on a menu listed as market price, you know that you had better double check prices first!). \n\nP.S. Luckily he disappeared 20 minutes into our experience, so we were able to let our guard down and try to enjoy our meal on an otherwise nice Friday afternoon.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-02-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered their watermelon iced tea which was also blended perfectly with fresh watermelon.
