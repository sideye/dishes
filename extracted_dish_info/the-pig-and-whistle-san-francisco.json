Oh, I had them in New Zealand too, but they sucked, everything there tastes like it was fried in sheep.\n\nSo my suggestion is that the oil probably needs to be hotter (too greasy) and for the chips, here's the deal:  read Anthony Bourdain's book on how to cook fries, it has to do with tempering them first I think, or something like that, um, cooking them before you cook them.\n\nAnyway, those couple suggestions and people will be raving about the fish and chips and since the beer selection was good, the staff very friendly and all that, the place would be five stars and always crowded with beautiful coeds, and that, my friend, sells some beer.\n\nUnless you're in England, where they don't like chicks in the pub, but this ain't the case.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-12-21"}, {"excerpts": ["I had shepherd's pie, my bf had fish and chips.

The inside looks like what I expected from a pub - wood interior, including the furniture, paintings/pictures all over the wall, a bar, and tv's. Some of the staff even complemented the ambiance of the pub with their British accent.  \n\nFor our first time to a place like this, we had to order the fish and chips. Out comes this plate with HUGE pieces of fried fish and chips=fries. This had to be the biggest (and cheapest) order of fish and chips I have ever seen! We also ordered the buffalo wings, which were different than what I'm used to. Instead of the sauce being on the wings, you get the cooked wings served with 3 types of sauces. Others in my group also ordered food and were happy with their selections.\n\nThere was a good crowd there for Quiz Night. Some had to be regulars! What you do is get into groups of however many people you want, and form teams. There are many different rounds which involve a variety of topics such as current events, geography, a celebrity picture round, or music. It was fun to see what kinds of random facts people know! Basically which ever group can answer the most questions correctly wins a prize. That night it was $30 cash. Although I don't drink, the rest of my group surely does, so the pitchers kept coming.

Now I essentially live @ work and school, so i don't come as often as I'd like, and I don't have as good a grasp on this bar as say the Dogpatch or Mission Bars. But let me tell you about this little gem.\n \nGreat food (fish and chips can be a bit bland but shepherds pie = god)\nAmple free pool & less ample free darts (save your quarters for laundry!)\nPitchers of plentiful beer selection.\nNeat mixed crowd, lots of folk. Make no mistake, this is a scots bar!\n\nSo as you can see, this is a great freaking bar. Now let me regale you with why I decided to yelp it now, after attending quite a few times.  With Bars I like to have a real story before I yelp them, unless they really stand out or I might be the first to yelp em.  Often also I go home and drunk yelp the place only to find that i never actually submitted my review and just forgot about it entirely. This was not the case with PNW, this was...\n\nSo I had just gotten off a long shoot (where we totally nailed the product shot, only to see that the Heineken bottle was out of focus, so much for an A on that film project). Rode the bus home, showered, and ba-dum-sum-cha my buddy Dave is at my door with a 12-pack of Newcastle.  We crack em open, let the dogs run out back and start talking about school.  Shortly after my friend (and now yelp friend) George M. shows up as well.  A few more beers later we mosey to the Pig and Whistle to meet an actor from our school + girlfriend, Dave's girlfriend Jill and her two co-workers, Later to be met by friend Kent. This is where the night turned bad.  Now Dave is as solid as a brick wall, but he acts crazy. Most people would think him pulling his knife on me three times was why it went bad, you'd be wrong (and if you thought that, you wouldn't be friends with Dave). Now Jill is always a hoot-n-a-half so no problems there. Kent is an awesome guy and George has quite a few markings of \"coolest mother on the planet.\" So we've eliminated them, which leaves us with, Jill's co-workers.  OK, they were really nice for awhile - kinda dull, but that's more than ignorable with pitcher after pitcher of beer and a group of 9 people. But it all goes downhill when you start proclaiming that this is such a nice Irish bar. It's Scottish, I don't expect you to know that, but I'm Irish and I'm sensitive about that stuff. Of course it's a small mistake, all is forgiven. Then the new tidbit of insight from a blonde's head was that my friend \"looked like marina boys.\"  That's a bad move, he doesn't like the Marina, and he lives close enough to catch shit for it regularly.\n\nHere's the similarities between my group and yours, we don't live in the Marina.\nHere's the differences, my group doesn't think it's a compliment to be called Marina-esqe. \n\nSo please young woman, if you are so hateful about living in the Sunset (understandable) then move out, go to the Marina! If there's anything more sad than a Marina mom it's a Marina wannabe. But that was really just more funny than anything else as my friend decided to push the issue, \"What about me makes you think Marina, seriously I'm not going to hold it against you, I want to know so I can rid myself of it, what makes you think Marina?\" Her back peddle and eventual excuse was hilarious. More importantly the other friend (after a solid four hours of drinking), pulls a half eaten burrito from her purse and begins munching on it. It wasn't wrapped well in the foil, I'm sure there are rice and beans all over her purse. I proceed to ask her with awe \"where'd you get that?!\" I'm meaning, why was it in your purse, she's a bit more literal and states some place in union sqaure. She didn't know the name. She goes there twice a week. What, is wrong, with her?\n\nShe should know the place's name, she shouldn't have left it in her purse, and for god sakes \"real San Franciscans don't eat Mexican food anywhere but the mission. Not even in Mexico!\" (Sally K.)\n\nanyway, called em a cab and went to bed -- just another night in laurel heights -- and a vote for why you met girls at the bar, and don't bring them with you.\n\nProximity to the Bridge Theater (currently playing Grindhouse) is a huge plus and bumps it up to the 5th star!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-04-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Place smells incredibly of fish and chips.

"], "author": "Tyler W.", "review": "This place is literally 700 feet from my house, needless to say I frequent it.  Now I essentially live @ work and school, so i don't come as often as I'd like, and I don't have as good a grasp on this bar as say the Dogpatch or Mission Bars. But let me tell you about this little gem.\n \nGreat food (fish and chips can be a bit bland but shepherds pie = god)\nAmple free pool & less ample free darts (save your quarters for laundry!)\nPitchers of plentiful beer selection.\nNeat mixed crowd, lots of folk. Make no mistake, this is a scots bar!\n\nSo as you can see, this is a great freaking bar. Now let me regale you with why I decided to yelp it now, after attending quite a few times.  With Bars I like to have a real story before I yelp them, unless they really stand out or I might be the first to yelp em.  Often also I go home and drunk yelp the place only to find that i never actually submitted my review and just forgot about it entirely. This was not the case with PNW, this was...\n\nSo I had just gotten off a long shoot (where we totally nailed the product shot, only to see that the Heineken bottle was out of focus, so much for an A on that film project). Rode the bus home, showered, and ba-dum-sum-cha my buddy Dave is at my door with a 12-pack of Newcastle.  We crack em open, let the dogs run out back and start talking about school.  Shortly after my friend (and now yelp friend) George M. shows up as well.  A few more beers later we mosey to the Pig and Whistle to meet an actor from our school + girlfriend, Dave's girlfriend Jill and her two co-workers, Later to be met by friend Kent. This is where the night turned bad.  Now Dave is as solid as a brick wall, but he acts crazy. Most people would think him pulling his knife on me three times was why it went bad, you'd be wrong (and if you thought that, you wouldn't be friends with Dave). Now Jill is always a hoot-n-a-half so no problems there. Kent is an awesome guy and George has quite a few markings of \"coolest mother on the planet.\" So we've eliminated them, which leaves us with, Jill's co-workers.  OK, they were really nice for awhile - kinda dull, but that's more than ignorable with pitcher after pitcher of beer and a group of 9 people. But it all goes downhill when you start proclaiming that this is such a nice Irish bar. It's Scottish, I don't expect you to know that, but I'm Irish and I'm sensitive about that stuff. Of course it's a small mistake, all is forgiven. Then the new tidbit of insight from a blonde's head was that my friend \"looked like marina boys.\"  That's a bad move, he doesn't like the Marina, and he lives close enough to catch shit for it regularly.\n\nHere's the similarities between my group and yours, we don't live in the Marina.\nHere's the differences, my group doesn't think it's a compliment to be called Marina-esqe. \n\nSo please young woman, if you are so hateful about living in the Sunset (understandable) then move out, go to the Marina! If there's anything more sad than a Marina mom it's a Marina wannabe. But that was really just more funny than anything else as my friend decided to push the issue, \"What about me makes you think Marina, seriously I'm not going to hold it against you, I want to know so I can rid myself of it, what makes you think Marina?\" Her back peddle and eventual excuse was hilarious. More importantly the other friend (after a solid four hours of drinking), pulls a half eaten burrito from her purse and begins munching on it. It wasn't wrapped well in the foil, I'm sure there are rice and beans all over her purse. I proceed to ask her with awe \"where'd you get that?!\" I'm meaning, why was it in your purse, she's a bit more literal and states some place in union sqaure. She didn't know the name. She goes there twice a week. What, is wrong, with her?\n\nShe should know the place's name, she shouldn't have left it in her purse, and for god sakes \"real San Franciscans don't eat Mexican food anywhere but the mission. Not even in Mexico!\" (Sally K.)\n\nanyway, called em a cab and went to bed -- just another night in laurel heights -- and a vote for why you met girls at the bar, and don't bring them with you.\n\nProximity to the Bridge Theater (currently playing Grindhouse) is a huge plus and bumps it up to the 5th star!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-04-07"}], "deli sandwich": [], "chicken marsala curry": [], "garden burger": [{"excerpts": ["Love the garden burger!
