I was taking the California Street cable car one night expecting to enter a regular restaurant with formica tables, naugahyde chairs, surly waiters, and a sun-faded poster of the Eiffel Tower half-torn on the wall. You know, like Sam Wo's reborn. But I guess I wasn't really in the Tenderloin, and real estate is clearly at more of a premium on Nob Hill. Surely that's the explanation for the walk-in closet that is Cordon Bleu on California near Polk Street. It reminds me of any number of greasy diners in New York like Johny's Luncheonette (no second 'n' please) where the counter is pretty much your only alternative other than the large-group tables in the back.\n\nIt was pretty crowded when I entered but not fully. Because a couple of mouthy hipsters decided to hog three stools between them, I stood against the wall waiting for an opening. They were so self-absorbed that it took a five full minutes before one of them acknowledged I was perhaps wanting to use the stool to eat and only after leaving his money (cash only). Thanks dudes...hope the cable car doesn't run you over when you jaywalk across the street. The two women who run the place pay no attention to such matters... they have a grill to master and rice to scoop. I grabbed one of the few well-used, laminated menus on the counter and started to peruse.\n\nLemme see... there are five combo plate entrees, four house specials, and on the other side of the menu, four veggie options. The choices struck me as more pan-Asian than strictly Vietnamese... kinda Korean by way of Saigon with a heavy emphasis on country comfort food, in other words, pure catnip for budget-conscious slackers. I decided to order the $9 Number Five, which consisted of a Five-Spice Roast Chicken Leg, \"Shish Kebab\" (without a stick and served in thin slices Korean-style), a large Imperial Roll chopped and heavily deep-fried, a \"Country Salad\" (a.k.a. shredded lettuce with some dressing), and the mysteriously described \"Meat Sauce on Rice\" (see photo).\n\nIronically it was this latter item that turned out to be the most satisfying component if only because it sopped up the drippings from the other four items. I still couldn't tell what kind of meat I was eating, but it was sloppy-Joe-good. The shish kebab and chicken were a tad overcooked for my taste, even though that didn't stop me from devouring either one. Despite the tasty filling, the roll was just way too crunchy-greasy to eat comfortably without having nightmares of a coronary where I would have to lay down on the dirty-plate-covered counter since there would be no room for a gurney in there.

Does it really assuage your corporate guilt or make you feel that much cooler to come here? \n\nThe food's alright if you need something cheap, substantial and fast, but it doesn't really stretch beyond that. Five spice chicken ($5.75) was two huge pieces of grilled chicken, the skin all blackened and crispy and with a slight hint of the spice flavor but nothing distinctive. Because the pieces were so big, this flavor couldn't really seep into the white meat inside which tasted fairly bland.\n\nThe shish kebab ($2.60) was more disappointing. It's not really a shish kebab - skewered chunks of meet - more thin strips of pork streaked with black lines from the grill. It had reasonably smoky flavor but again nothing all that special. \n\nIn the menu set this came with an Imperial roll which I changed to a fresh Vietnamese spring roll. This was vegetarian with some tofu inside. It didn't taste bad, but the things inside seemed a little bland and it didn't really have that crispness of fresh vegetables which the best Vietnamese spring rolls can give. It came with a thick peanut sauce akin to peanut butter.\n\nIn the sets we had (numbers 1 and 4), both these dished were plonked on a pile of white rice that had been covered in meat sauce. This sauce has hints of tomato ketchup about it and little pieces of pork. It gave the rice some flavor but really didn't do much more.

There's bar seating surrounding the open kitchen where sizzling meats are being grilled before your eyes, a pot of \"mystery meat sauce\" (which you will discover is delicious, and dribbled all over your rice) is boiling away, and a stack of imperial rolls are being dipped repeatedly in a vat of oil.\n\nThose imperial rolls ... oh my god. The best Vietnamese spring rolls you'll ever taste in your life. They're also about 3x the size of a normal imperial roll, but hey, I'm not complaining.\n\nThe #5 (with an imperial roll, 1 piece of five-spiced roast chicken, 1 shish kebab, country salad and meat sauce on rice) appears to be the most popular dish. At almost $10, it's not cheap either. Honestly, the rice was really clumpy and overcooked, but the aforementioned meat sauce makes up for it. The chicken was super tender and the shish kebab tasted like yummy glazed jerky, but the clear winner was the imperial roll.\n\nThe wait is a bit of a downer -- my two friends and I arrived around 7:55pm, put in our orders around 8:05pm (although we were waiting at the register, you kind of have to be aggressive about getting your order in -- just like in Asia!), and didn't receive our food till 8:30pm. Total wait almost 40 minutes.

A little too charred for my liking, though.\n\n- The shish kebab (not really shish kebab) was probably the best thing in the box, and went well with the little plastic tub of nuoc cham.\n\n- The imperial roll was enormous and crispy, but kind of tasted of stale oil. The risks of coming in near closing time, I guess.\n\n- The country salad was a small pile of shredded cabbage. As small piles of shredded cabbage go, it was fine.\n\n- The meat sauce, I could have done without. Underseasoned and gloopy, in desperate need of a squirt of Sriracha. It might have been better if I'd eaten it there rather than taking it to go, but the restaurant doesn't have a whole lot of seating.\n\nIf I were still in college, I'd probably be a regular here.
