We've ordered takeout from this dingy establishment since I was in fifth grade, and for some reason, we keep on going back. The food is by far not the best, but the prices are very competitive for an Asian restaurant. I still remember getting dropped off as a little boy on the weekend, carrying $30 in cash, running straight to the register, and telling the cashier that I've ordered something for takeout. We usually call in around 30 minute ahead of time, and they always say the food will be done in 15-20 minutes. We always seem to fall for the trap and get there 20 minutes after we call. The cashier then nonchalantly tells me to \"wait a bit kid, the food's still cooking!\" Though the cashiers have changed through the years, I still get a bit confused when my food isn't ready even though they told me to come at this time! Waiting there for 10 minutes, I noticed that the only people that eat here are Chinese construction workers. Conclusion? It's a really affordable place.\n\nWe generally like ordering the fried rice and chow mein dishes. On this occasion, probably our 20th time? man, time really flies, we ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Chow Mein, Yangchow Fried Rice w/Shrimp and Pork, and Singapore-style Rice Vermicelli. These are extremely common Cantonese-styled dishes that you can find at most typical Chinese restaurants in the U.S. of A. \n\nYANGCHOW FRIED RICE W/SHRIMP AND PORK ($6): The most solid of the three dishes, this yangchow fried rice LACKED FLAVOR and the pieces of char siu (BBQ pork), if there was much at all, were extremely hard and reminded me of bacon bits. I usually find solace in eating this dish, but even after eating 3 cups of this, I still WASN'T SATISFIED.\n\nCHICKEN CHOW MEIN ($6): This dish was \"MEH\". Nothing really to complain about, a generous heaping of bok choy, and chicken strips that could be cut with a sharper knife.\n\nSINGAPORE-STYLE RICE VERMICELLI ($6): the most underwhelming of the three dishes. The chef really needed to add some more curry power or salt or something cause it was BLAND. The SHRIMP WAS CLEAN, which is one of my huge pet peeves, so they get bonus points for that! The char sui was dry and not up to standard.\n\nTASTE: 2-3 Stars--Food is \"meh\".\nSERVICE: can't say cause I came here for takeout!\nPRICE: 4-5 Stars--you can't beat the price--seriously!\nTOTAL: 3 Stars--I would give it 3.5 for the price, but the food is really of a \"meh\" quality.\n\nBottom Line: THIS PLACE IS SUPER CHEAP. If you can find a place in SF where you can eat a good amount for only $6 a plate, message me! However, cheap doesn't mean good. The food here really is \"MEH\". Would I come again?

The man, an Irish emigre, apparently had never had Chinese food before; he asked his companion, a fetching Russian girl, what chow mein was. The girl asked the waiter about an item on the menu. Following ST custom, the waiter responded, \"Very good choice!\" Five minutes later, a sumptuous plate of fried rice came for the gentleman, and for the devushka: a small dish of cold gelatinous offal.

The seafood tastes fresh, all items are non-greasy and made to order, and there are always HELLA chinese people eating here when we come for dinner, which is a GREAT sign.
