Startup workers and post-hipsters, come eat here. Ghost of Steve Jobs, come eat here. This place certainly has the \"i\" part down, with the brushed aluminum on white themed interior and OS X window buttons on the menu. The music is largely straight-up club, and there's a curtained stage at the back as a hint of the future of this establishment. Bring your air guitar.\n\nThe menu has items you've seen at other Thai places. Two sections that may have surprises for you are \"Something Specials\" and \"I'm Adventurous\". Turns out that being adventurous means being Filipino, with regard to the chicharr\u00f3n fried rice and the bagook x green mango dishes. At least, those were the images that came to mind when reading over the descriptions for \"Kao Pad Kark Moo\" (\"Ultimate iThai fried rice with crispy pork skin, carrots, onions, and egg\") and \"Kao Klook Gapi\" (\"Shrimp paste rice with side of sour mango, sweet pork, egg strips, sun dried shrimps\").\n\nThe KPKM pork skin was less rind and more skin + fat layer + meat, kind of like bacon's older brother who happens to play varsity football. Cucumber slices garnished the plate, but the carrots, onions, and egg were absent. Since we'd only ordered this dish to try the pork skin, perhaps it's better that no other ingredients got in the way.\n\nThe KKG shrimp paste, nam plik, was a subtler and less salty version of bagook with the tiny shrimps ground up. Rather than a tongue assault like Korean saeujeot (which primarily isn't intended as a condiment anyway), the nam plik was dippable, spreadable, and overall more approachable as a table item. The sour mango was pickled, which was a new concept to me - I thought it would be green (unripe) mango.\n\nWe also had \"Keaw Wan Roti\" for some Indian influence, and its curry unexpectedly included makla (likely incorrect spelling), a small and round Thai eggplant.\n\nRounding out our set was a carafe of \"Cloudy in Bangkok\", similar to Korean yogurt soju. Ordering the carafe instead of a glass seemed like a good move because the contents were somehow just enough for the accompanying cocktail-sized cup. But how big would the glass have been? If the glass would've been similar to the cup, we shouldn't have opted for the carafe at twice the price. You may want to ask to see the vessels before making your choice.\n\nOur meal was interesting and our servers were friendly. Oddly enough though, for being named \"iThai\", there weren't a bunch of outlets for plugging in MacBooks to work while eating. All in all, this is one of those places that I want to rate well because I liked it but want to rate poorly so it won't be popular and overcrowded next time we go.

When I stopped coming here, renovations to the places had recently started and the quality of many of the dishes had gone down to my disappointment.\n\nI told myself that I would eventually come back to see if the quality improves, especially since there were a few items that either they offered only, or did better than other Thai restaurants.\n\nI've been here about 5 times in the past 2 weeks trying (again) some of the dishes I was found of here.  The verdict?  Quality has much improved.\n\nOne of the first things I ordered was Kao Mok Gai (Herbed chicken with curried rice). The flavor was about as good as I remembered it should be, the only difference is the chicken is boneless now, which I'm a little bummed about since I like gnawing on the grizzle on the bone (must be the Asian in me).  I see few other Thai restaurants serving this dish as well.\n\nSecond visit was Yum Pla Dook Foo (Crispy catfish salad).  Nothing wrong here. Good vegetable to fish ratio, fried fish didn't get soggy quickly, and seasoning was great, though I could have gone spicier.\n\nAlso, ordered was Gui Chai (fried chive dumplings). This dish has always been good. It doesn't taste like it's burnt or been cooked in old oil like some other places.\n\nThird visit was Kao Pad Moo Kark (Fried rice with crispy pork skin). This was one of the dishes I initially liked most because the only other place that I've had it is in Thailand.  It's actually a pretty simple dish; well seasoned fried rice with crispy pork skin... and some pork belly.  Mind you, the emphasis on this dish should be on pork skin, not pork meat.  And really no one should be complaining that they got served only pork skin.\n\nThe dish was almost as good as when I first ordered it here.  My main complaint is the rice was a bit on the greasy side, even for a dish that is basically fried pork skin and fried pork fat.\n\nMy latest visit here, I had Koh Moo Yang (pork shoulder w/ tamarind sauce).  Nothing necessarily wrong with this dish, I just wasn't very impressed with it. Perhaps, I just wasn't in the mood for this dish like I thought.  The pork had good flavor and was tender.  The tamarind sauce was a bit sweeter than I expected and not as spicy as expected either. Maybe that's why I'm indifferent toward this dish. Anyhow, not a bad dish, just not my dish (at least not on that night).\n\nOther thoughts?\nThe makeover is nice.  The chairs are much nicer and more comfortable.  Some items have been removed from the menu, like Bamee Jup Kang (an egg noodle soup with pork), which I'm disappointed about.\n\nOverall, I'll probably continuing coming back here (again).

", "Nothing wrong here. "], "author": "Dennis Z.", "review": "I decided to try iThai again a couple of weeks ago after not eating here for several months.  When I stopped coming here, renovations to the places had recently started and the quality of many of the dishes had gone down to my disappointment.\n\nI told myself that I would eventually come back to see if the quality improves, especially since there were a few items that either they offered only, or did better than other Thai restaurants.\n\nI've been here about 5 times in the past 2 weeks trying (again) some of the dishes I was found of here.  The verdict?  Quality has much improved.\n\nOne of the first things I ordered was Kao Mok Gai (Herbed chicken with curried rice). The flavor was about as good as I remembered it should be, the only difference is the chicken is boneless now, which I'm a little bummed about since I like gnawing on the grizzle on the bone (must be the Asian in me).  I see few other Thai restaurants serving this dish as well.\n\nSecond visit was Yum Pla Dook Foo (Crispy catfish salad).  Nothing wrong here. Good vegetable to fish ratio, fried fish didn't get soggy quickly, and seasoning was great, though I could have gone spicier.\n\nAlso, ordered was Gui Chai (fried chive dumplings). This dish has always been good. It doesn't taste like it's burnt or been cooked in old oil like some other places.\n\nThird visit was Kao Pad Moo Kark (Fried rice with crispy pork skin). This was one of the dishes I initially liked most because the only other place that I've had it is in Thailand.  It's actually a pretty simple dish; well seasoned fried rice with crispy pork skin... and some pork belly.  Mind you, the emphasis on this dish should be on pork skin, not pork meat.  And really no one should be complaining that they got served only pork skin.\n\nThe dish was almost as good as when I first ordered it here.  My main complaint is the rice was a bit on the greasy side, even for a dish that is basically fried pork skin and fried pork fat.\n\nMy latest visit here, I had Koh Moo Yang (pork shoulder w/ tamarind sauce).  Nothing necessarily wrong with this dish, I just wasn't very impressed with it. Perhaps, I just wasn't in the mood for this dish like I thought.  The pork had good flavor and was tender.  The tamarind sauce was a bit sweeter than I expected and not as spicy as expected either. Maybe that's why I'm indifferent toward this dish. Anyhow, not a bad dish, just not my dish (at least not on that night).\n\nOther thoughts?\nThe makeover is nice.  The chairs are much nicer and more comfortable.  Some items have been removed from the menu, like Bamee Jup Kang (an egg noodle soup with pork), which I'm disappointed about.\n\nOverall, I'll probably continuing coming back here (again).

It's the thai street food we grew up with. This and the Pad Krapaos are the \"I don't know what to eat\" standard dishes.\n\nHungry and need something fast? Their pad see ew moo gets done, It's practically our fast food dish. it's lightly seared soft noodles flavoured with sauce and pork.\n\nI really like their pork lately, It's not dry like many other places, So I'd recommend their pork fried rice, too\n\nFor less \"usual\" things, Their pla duk fu is crunchy and classier than most of the pla duk fus i had.\nAnd if you want beef, Their Sur rong hai is tasty as heck.

We're pretty obsessed.\nAnd this place is where the thais go around here.\n\nI started going through their menu one by one, and I was blown away. I still haven't eaten them all. Because I liked some so much I just kept ordering it.\n\n\nHere's some tips:\n\nTheir Giew Tod was extra crunchy, and goes pretty darn well with the noodles.\nTalking about noodles, the soup of their Guai jub was a very pleasant surprise of rolled noodles with crunchy pork bits, and their Kao Soi is great if you want a taste of curry on your noodles. It's a dish famous in the northern parts of Thailand.\n\nI love their Ka moo, It's juicy pork leg on sauced rice. (you can probably ask them for more or less fat pieces if you prefer) It's also a good indication that their \"Kao na ped\" will taste pretty good.\n\nKao mun gai, It's chicken with flavored rice. It's the thai street food we grew up with. This and the Pad Krapaos are the \"I don't know what to eat\" standard dishes.\n\nHungry and need something fast? Their pad see ew moo gets done, It's practically our fast food dish. it's lightly seared soft noodles flavoured with sauce and pork.\n\nI really like their pork lately, It's not dry like many other places, So I'd recommend their pork fried rice, too\n\nFor less \"usual\" things, Their pla duk fu is crunchy and classier than most of the pla duk fus i had.\nAnd if you want beef, Their Sur rong hai is tasty as heck. It's like steak, but less oily and more aroma.

Its a little sweet but not bad. I love how they add egg. They add a reasonable amount of crab. A hint of spicy would make it more awesome! \n\nPad See-Ew Moo: Pan fried white noodle with thai black bean sauce. A pretty perfect balance between noodles, chinese broccolli, egg and pork.

The flavor was about as good as I remembered it should be, the only difference is the chicken is boneless now, which I'm a little bummed about since I like gnawing on the grizzle on the bone (must be the Asian in me).  I see few other Thai restaurants serving this dish as well.\n\nSecond visit was Yum Pla Dook Foo (Crispy catfish salad).  Nothing wrong here. Good vegetable to fish ratio, fried fish didn't get soggy quickly, and seasoning was great, though I could have gone spicier.\n\nAlso, ordered was Gui Chai (fried chive dumplings). This dish has always been good. It doesn't taste like it's burnt or been cooked in old oil like some other places.\n\nThird visit was Kao Pad Moo Kark (Fried rice with crispy pork skin). This was one of the dishes I initially liked most because the only other place that I've had it is in Thailand.  It's actually a pretty simple dish; well seasoned fried rice with crispy pork skin... and some pork belly.  Mind you, the emphasis on this dish should be on pork skin, not pork meat.  And really no one should be complaining that they got served only pork skin.\n\nThe dish was almost as good as when I first ordered it here.  My main complaint is the rice was a bit on the greasy side, even for a dish that is basically fried pork skin and fried pork fat.\n\nMy latest visit here, I had Koh Moo Yang (pork shoulder w/ tamarind sauce).  Nothing necessarily wrong with this dish, I just wasn't very impressed with it. Perhaps, I just wasn't in the mood for this dish like I thought.  The pork had good flavor and was tender.  The tamarind sauce was a bit sweeter than I expected and not as spicy as expected either. Maybe that's why I'm indifferent toward this dish. Anyhow, not a bad dish, just not my dish (at least not on that night).\n\nOther thoughts?\nThe makeover is nice.  The chairs are much nicer and more comfortable.  Some items have been removed from the menu, like Bamee Jup Kang (an egg noodle soup with pork), which I'm disappointed about.\n\nOverall, I'll probably continuing coming back here (again).  And they still have late night karaoke, and a live band on Fridays which is another thing I like.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-06-21"}], "koa na gai": [], "kao na ped yang": [], "hoy todd": [], "kanom pak kad": [{"excerpts": ["Kanom Pak Kad was a little underwhelming but exactly as described, and the Kao Ka Mu was very good (and somewhat reminiscent of Taiwanese pork dishes).

Here was my old post \"I really wanted to like you because I live so close... but gross. Sorry.\"\n\nSo you want more details of why I gave you only one star, well here you go:\n\nMy boyfriend and I went into the restaurant because the place had opened down the street from where we live and it looked cool.  The colors/decor were neat and it seemed to be a quite popular with a full crowd.  Alas, like many restaurants who are... as Cher would put it \"a full on monet,\" we waited for the hype to calm and decided to try the food.  Here is what we ordered:\n\n1. Tom Yum Noodle Soup.  It was bland and not at all favorable. The fish balls were tough and honestly uneatable.  The broth was super boring and I felt like the quality overall was a one star on a grade of 1-5. I ate only two bites of it and had had enough. It's VERY RARE that I order a dinner and can't muster myself to eat more than a couple of bites.\n\n2. My boyfriend had the iThai Seafood Noodles.  The mussels were small, dinky and frankly we thought the quality of them might make is ill.  We tried it anyway and confirmed our initial conclusion - they were gross. Secondly, the shrimp - omg where did you get the shrimp?  It was SUPER tough and flavorless. My boyfriend and I both tried a couple of bites and had enough.\n\nThe server was SUPER sweet however, and we kindly asked for containers to-go. We packaged up our food and gave it to a homeless person on our way out.  We then proceeded to another restaurant to order dinner AGAIN!!! What a waste of money.  I honestly even felt a little bad giving that food to the homeless man.\n\nI guess my point here is that I didn't want to spend the time going into why the place was gross - it just was.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes?  Look, we walk past your restaurant multiple times a day - there is a reason why it is always empty.    \n\nI'm sorry iThai.  I'm a legitimate customer with a legitimate reason to post what I posted and what I'm posting now.  People deserve to know if they're going to spend $40+ on a dinner that is flavorless and poor quality.
