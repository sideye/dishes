Since I wanted to hit up his other reco Plow for breakfast/brunch, I knew I needed to be committed and get myself up NLT 6:30AM on a Sunday so I can get the best of both worlds while minimizing my wait time.  We arrived at Neighbor around 7:30 when most of SF is still sleeping and therefore super quiet as we walked up which immediately reminded me of my early morning arrival in Portland Maine not too long ago before it started bustling.  Just like Two Fat Cats in Portland, most of their freshly baked pastries are still on racks upon walking in enticing me to get more than I really needed.  \n\nPassion Fruit DoughP Bun - This was my favorite one that I wished my husband didn't forget the cooler so I could take one to go since the cream of the DoughP requires refrigeration if you don't eat it soon after purchase.  \n\n2 Pistachio Blackberry Twice Baked Croissant - My second favorite as it was not overly sweet and I love the nuttiness of the whole pistachios giving it a good balance.  \n\nTwo Morning Buns with Ham and Gruyere - It was good but I kind of wish there was a little more gruyere in it to fill in the hole in the middle.  \n\nHazelnut Candy Orange Financier - This was on the dense side kind of like a pound cake\n\nGinger Pull Apart - Upon first bite, I wasn't a fan but as I continued, I liked it more.  Good for sharing but probably a bit too much for one person especially if you want to try other pastries.  \n\nOverall, Neighbor Bakehouse is a great friendly neighborhood bakery that I just wish was in my neighborhood but then again, it is probably better for our waistline that it is a 45+ min drive away, making it more of a treat than an addiction!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-06-09"}, {"excerpts": ["I'm in love with the pistachio blackberry twice baked croissant!

The twice baked croissant with pistachios and blackberries was delicious as well! The doughpy bun is a donut with filling. I got the passionfruit one which I found a bit on the tart side, but the bun itself was really tasty! I also bought the ginger pastry, guava roll, and some other items that I didn't actually get to taste for myself. \n\nDefinitely a must go the next time in SF.

The perfect start to any day. \n\n(2) The ginger pull apart - The way this bread is twisted not only makes this bread a fun pull apart to share with friends, but it is also positioned as to maximize the surface area and optimize the crunch effect - and add to that the flavor of the fiery ginger. This is another classic. \n\n(3) The Twice Baked Croissants - I really enjoy the various flavors of the twice makes. The way that the berries complement the herbs, all baked inside a twice baked croissant for that added crunchy texture makes for a complex flavor combination with varying debts of texture. \n\n(4) The Kimchee Toast - On top the buttery, fresh thick milk toast are the tart kimchee, scallions, and cheese.  Though I have a sweet tooth, I quite enjoy the savory bread on occasion.  The one thing that makes this one more enjoyable is reheating it - else the kimchee-cheese-scallion is easy to separate from the toast and the situation gets messy. \n\nThe tea and coffee are also carefully made cup by cup - a good wake up call. \n\nNeighbor Bakehouse, I'm so happy we are neighbors.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-10-21"}, {"excerpts": ["very little hint of ginger taste, reminds me of monkey bread but better\n\nCinnamon Almond Bostock - "], "author": "Connie W.", "review": "Street parking was easy for 9:30 on Sun morning.\nLined up outside and ate outside at communal picnic tables.

The pistachio innards are fantastic, and the croissant is flaky outside, buttery, and moist inside.\n\nHam and Cheese Morning Bun ($4.25) - interior is rolled in sesame seeds and poppy seeds which really distinguishes this from your typical ham and cheese pastry.  Really soft and tasty, but cheese formed a hard disc on the bottom which I didn't particularly care for, however this is a good savory option.\n\nGinger Pull-Apart Bread ($3.75) - hubby liked it.  I liked the buttery pieces (personally not a fan of ginger), however the pastry was not consistent throughout--some pieces super buttery, some super gingery, some slightly dry.  Hubby would get again, but I'd pass, as if prefer for it to be more consistent and moist throughout.  Overhyped in my opinion.\n\nChocolate Pudding Dough Bread ($4) - good pudding interior and nice salty crunchy chocolatey bits on top.  However, the bread itself was slightly dry--I understand how another Yelper mentioned it tasted stale...I don't think it's really stale (they're constantly turning pastries with the constant line at this place!)--I think it's just that the bread has to be relatively harder to hold its shape with the liquidy pudding inside.  I warmed it up in the microwave for 12 seconds--but that was probably 10 seconds too long, because the pudding became chocolate milk.  Tasty but messy pudding!

Not bad for SF brunch, considering a meal for one consisting of mediocre eggs could be the same. On the pastry quality alone it's between a 4 and 5 but rounding up. I don't like overly sweet desserts so, the pastries are the perfect level of slight sugariness, layers of flour and butter - clearly fresh and made with high quality ingredients.\n\nWas it among the best pastries I've had? No, not mindblowingly good, but still pretty damn good. I'd say top tier for SF and very reasonable for the price. Neighbor Bakehouse is way better than Tartine, but the craftsmanship level is not as high as b. patisserie, nor are the pastries as delicate. The best part is it's not crowded, but that'll probably change. Outdoor seating, bus your own tables, lemon and lime water at the station.\n\nWe sampled a few of these\nOrange Hazelnut Financier (3/5) - Soft crumb cake like and fairly uniform texture throughout. Interesting flavor, with bits of candied orange.\nGinger Pull Apart Bread (4/5) - Subtle cinnamon sugar and ginger, some pieces are drier and flaky, some pieces are layers of softer, buttery dough, but one of my favorite parts is how the bottom gets slightly chewy and hardened caramelized crust piece.\nHam and Cheese Morning Bun (3.5/5) - The cheese congealed into a big chunk around the center, sliced ham also lay in a swirl in between the outer part and inner. Sunflower and poppy seeds line the outside.\nKimchi Sauerkraut Tart (4/5) - Bread was buttery and amazing, kimchi could be spicier, cheese wasn't really necessary. I found that much more filling than the morning bun.\n\nI've also had the\nTwice Baked Pistachio Blueberry Croissant (4.5/5) - Really good and where the technique shows.

Reminds me of those savory bread from a Chinese bakery, but with an updated bread base.\n\nPISTACHIO BLACKBERRY TWICE BAKED (4.5/5)\nThis is my sister's all time favorite (still like the everything croissant better). I didn't know pistachio can be incorporated like this in a croissant! The pistachio was creamy and it mixed so well with the flaky soft texture of the croissant. Sadly my sister devoured it before I get a piece of it with the blackberry.\n\nHAM AND CHEESE MORNING BUN (3/5)\nHonestly I got this one because it was pretty. Maybe because I ate it hours after I got it so it wasn't super fresh, but it was medicore. Don't get me wrong it was good, but compared to the other amazing pastries they had it just didn't stand out.\n\nPASSION FRUIT DOUGHP BUN (4/5)\nYum yum yum. The passion fruit filling was refreshing after eating all of the savory carbs. It wasn't too overwhelming like I expected and compliments the breading around the cream.\n\nGERMAN COFFEE CAKE (4/5)\nAnother refreshing treat after eating the savory pastries.

I know - stop whatever you're doing, get in a car, \u00fcber, or the T line muni, arrive at Neighbor and buy the ginger pull apart. This is my favorite pastry of all time. Why? It's a myriad of textures and flavors that evoke all the best aspects of perfect baked goods. The pastry is composed of croissant dough scraps pieced together and layered with sugar and crystallized ginger. Its got a bit of that super on trend kouign Amman swagger with twice the size and twice the textural variance. The top is light and airy like those awesome bubbles that form on the crust of a pizza. Inside it's doughy and soft, like the inner layers of a cinnamon roll or raised donut. The bottom gets a crazy crystalized sugar caramelization that sticks to your teeth like ginger taffy. The aroma is buttery with dancing ginger spice and is never too sweet or too spicy. It is perfection. \n\nAnd that's just one pastry!!\n\nNeighbor doesn't get the shine of some of the hipper spots in the city but it deserves all the glory. Their croissants are perfect, and I've tried them all from plain to chocolate (claw) to everything (bagel) to salmon to blackberry pistachio. Flawless layers of fluffy flour and butter. They also have a wonderful sauerkraut tart and rotating veggie tarts that perfectly balance savory ingredients with a sweet dough. I have literally tried almost every thing this shop has to offer and have never been disappointed. \n\nThey also offer whole loaves of bread, and recently I picked up a fresh sourdough sandwich loaf ($6) and made the best French toast of my life with it.
