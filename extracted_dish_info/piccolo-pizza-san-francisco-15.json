The food is awesome and [most] of the staff is incredibly friendly and inviting.  I love love love their pizza, the crust is awesome, not too thin, not too thick, and they do not put too much tomato sauce (which is something that I hate) on their slices. Their Hawaiian is my favorite. Once you have visited their shop a few times, they begin to recognize you and often include little perks. The bf and I go in there probably once a week for a quick lunch or bite for dinner. The owners are always offering us free drinks/French fries/etc. The hours are great (open late night -'til like 3am). The food beyond the pizza is good too - their Italian sub-style sandwiches are really good.
