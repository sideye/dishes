Although does an executive chef cook at the restaurant?Nevertheless, we made it there on Thursday night. We found street parking a block away. The decor of the place is simple and contemporary, not overbearing like some other places and still very pleasant. They don't have a liquor license but their wine list is expansive.

Sarah's house baked Levain with the cultured butter  was wonderful, we ate it all up before any other thing came. It was crunchy on the outside but the crust wasn't too big with soft, fresh and dense on the inside. Chilled Squid Ink Noodles were delicious and went well with the lemon and fennel flavor. Their take on Pozole was interesting and flavorful. However, I don't know how I feel about the popcorn in it. For the main course we got the Petit Fillet and Peruvian Purple Polenta. We got Petit fillet as medium rare, the meat was good quality and went well with accompaniments. It was nothing special that you could not do at your grill. Peruvian Purple Polenta was my least favorite. It is hard to make polenta bad in my opinion but the high ratio of peas to polenta in it didn't work for me. For dessert, we got the Toasted Angel Food Cake and Souffle tart. The Toasted Angel Food Cake is served with blueberry, mascarpone, lavender ice cream and goes complimented it very well. Cake was light, juicy and not too sweet, the ice cream was delicious too. Warm Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 tart is accompanied by cocoa nib brittle, salted caramel ice cream, which is quite obviously a good combination. Tart was hot and perfect texture.

Melissa Perello has dazzled crowds for years at Frances but I've always thought it was too packed and too loud to really engage in the kind of artistic appreciation the food deserves.  Here, Perello has a lot more space, as do her patrons, and the results are impeccable in every way.\n\nIn lieu of entrees, my wife and I took the tasting route, fitting in five different smaller plates and a dessert for maximum menu coverage.  This plan proved to be a stroke of genius by the end, when we were stumped at the thought of trying to pick favorites.   The first two arrivals were a beautiful (ok, all the dishes were works of art) roasted cauliflower salad with Meyer Lemon and Medjool dates and toasted almonds.  The cauliflower was crisp outside and soft inside, and the date puree (along with a few whole dates) added a fun and sweet complement to the tart lemon.  Along with this salad, we received sauteed prawns on a flavorful, deep green bed of broccoli and cavolo nero.  The prawns were done just right, and the bowl (each piece here is handmade for the restaurant) was encircled with a stream of earthy, fabulous pumpkin seed pesto.  \n\nNext came heartier, more robust courses.  The soup started with a mound of roasted kuri squash, poured over with a creamy broth of red lentils in a fragrant Madras curry and then doused with a drizzle of whipped yogurt.  This is my kind of comfort food.  This was balanced by sharp, tangy bites of spinach tossed in rapini pesto with provolone and taggiasche olives, all topped off with crunchy garlic toasts.  Finally, another deep green delight unfolded itself with the tagliatelle constructed of stinging nettles nicely finished with grana padano, lemon, and a superb flurry of toasted bread crumbs (pangrattato) that added unique taste and texture.  \n\nSometimes a meal is so good you have to push yourself to have dessert because you know they'll just kill it, and we were right.  We received a lovely round brown-toasted angel food cake, surrounded by chunks of pink lady apple and smooth brown butter (evoking caramel) ice cream.  All about the plate were delicate traces apple sauce that helped bring everything together decadently.\n\nThere is gorgeous, rustic, natural decor abounding here, and a full open kitchen is always a treat.   The spacious area in front of the kitchen is a great stage for watching food emerge, wine (or cocktails - the house special is a real find) being delivered, and hot bread being wrapped and carried to tables.

I also knew which three desserts I wanted prior to getting to dinner. \n\nWe started off with bread (so good you have to get this! Get two!), the chilled squid ink noodles and much raved about \"deviled egg\". The quotes imply it's not really deviled (because deviled eggs have a hard yolk). The egg is actually beautifully yolky and was delicious nonetheless. If you order the bread, this is a good time to eat it, slathering butter all over it and sopping up the sunshine on your plate. \n\nMoving on to dinner, we ordered the Day boat scallops, and Sonoma duck breast & sausage. I loved everything about the scallop dish. Absolutely everything was perfect. The flavors were well balanced, it had enough texture variance, and of course it was delicious.   \n\nSince I don't eat pork, I had a small bite of duck which was a tad gamey but still really good. \n\nNow on to dessert. I knew which three I wanted and when I asked the waiter for which his favorite was he mentioned they were all good (of course) which made it even harder to choose. He seemed a little judgey that I was going to order three desserts (eh, ain't no thang) so I went with two and decided to get a third if I still wanted it (of course I still want it but decided against the third later, lol). \n\nWe went with the Wildflower Honey crumb pudding and Winter spice profiteroles. Of the two, we enjoyed the honey crumb pudding much more than the profiteroles. \n\nI probably would skip the profiteroles next time.

For my 3800th review, one-starred Octavia is well worth the honors.\n\nI had the pleasure of dining with a fun group of folks, all of whom opted for the $70 tasting menu. This is an amazing deal given how much you're getting; the entrees alone, on an a la carte basis, are priced in the mid-$30s. It's all the more amazing given that it's not uncommon to spend twice as much on food alone at one-star Michelin establishments here in the Bay Area these days.\n\nWe started with Octavia's take on a deviled egg. Absolutely savory and delicious, and what a way to begin a meal on an already-filling note. We were also served helpings of their house-baked levain bread, complete with warm butter. Soooo fresh and sooo good. On a normal day when I'm not pigging out, this could be a meal in and of itself. Of course, we kept asking for more, please!\n\nIf this wasn't enough carbs already, we were also presented with a dish of gougeres (fancy cheese puffs for the uninitiated) to share. Cue up foodgasmic squeals of delight all around, Meg Ryan-style in \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nNext came a series of dishes ranging from sashimi to salad to salmon to steak. Even if these were tasting-sized, as opposed to full entree-sized, we'd have already passed the $70 mark in value halfway through. So much substance and so much enjoyment throughout. And as if all this wasn't enough, we chose two desserts: the warm chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart with salted caramel ice cream (ZOMG!!!) and some profiteroles. \n\nWe were beyond floored with the value and variety we got by choosing the tasting menu. It was truly a Michelin-worthy dining experience and I'm all WTF at some of the middling reviews here. The service managed to be professional and casual at the same time, and the entire experience was an approachable family-style affair over quality dishes. So, folks, leave your sour grapes at the door and just enjoy an evening's worth of conversation with a good group of folks.

Highly, HIGHLY recommend coming to Octavia before it gets even more popular!\n\n[Dinner]\nI ate so much and enjoyed every bite, where do I even begin! The menu is split into small bites, smaller plates for sharing, and then larger entrees. Our server recommended about 2 large entrees, three small plates, and three small bites for our group of three. I can't remember a few of the dishes given my stomach moves faster than my brain, but here are the ones that left an impression: \n\nDeviled Egg - Highly recommend - I don't normally like deviled eggs but this one had a very unique flavor. \nChilled Squid Ink Noodles - My favorite small plate, great al dente noodles. Highly recommend!  \nAvocado Salad - I really enjoyed this dish, the vegetables and flavor combination left my mouth feeling very fresh.\nGrilled Calamari - This was ok. I didn't really like the texture of grilled calamari but wanted to give it a try. Would recommend picking a different dish. \nTortellini Dish - Can't remember the exact name of this dish, but this one was my favorite of the group! Great flavors and extremely well made pasta. \nAlaskan Halibut - The fish was extremely well cooked but I didn't find anything super special with the dish. However, great alternative to the more meat heavy entr\u00e9e options. \n\n[Desert]\nI had the warm chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart. TO DIE FOR! Definitely recommend ordering this amazing desert. \n\n[Wine]\nI had a great pinot noir pairing that my server recommended.\n\n[Service]\nI'm so embarrassed that I probably had too much wine that night since my parents don't really drink so I had the whole carafe to myself and the next morning when I read my receipt I realized my mental math was wayyyyy off. However, I emailed the restaurant to try to retroactively fix my tip bill because my server was super awesome, but unfortunately they never called me to let me fix the bill.

Although does an executive chef cook at the restaurant?Nevertheless, we made it there on Thursday night. We found street parking a block away. The decor of the place is simple and contemporary, not overbearing like some other places and still very pleasant. They don't have a liquor license but their wine list is expansive. Sommelier was helpful and not snobbish (we've all dealt with that person!) and service was friendly.\nWe started with Sarah's house baked Levain, Chilled Squid Ink Noodles and Smoked Mushroom Pozole.  Sarah's house baked Levain with the cultured butter  was wonderful, we ate it all up before any other thing came. It was crunchy on the outside but the crust wasn't too big with soft, fresh and dense on the inside. Chilled Squid Ink Noodles were delicious and went well with the lemon and fennel flavor. Their take on Pozole was interesting and flavorful. However, I don't know how I feel about the popcorn in it. For the main course we got the Petit Fillet and Peruvian Purple Polenta. We got Petit fillet as medium rare, the meat was good quality and went well with accompaniments. It was nothing special that you could not do at your grill. Peruvian Purple Polenta was my least favorite. It is hard to make polenta bad in my opinion but the high ratio of peas to polenta in it didn't work for me. For dessert, we got the Toasted Angel Food Cake and Souffle tart. The Toasted Angel Food Cake is served with blueberry, mascarpone, lavender ice cream and goes complimented it very well. Cake was light, juicy and not too sweet, the ice cream was delicious too. Warm Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 tart is accompanied by cocoa nib brittle, salted caramel ice cream, which is quite obviously a good combination. Tart was hot and perfect texture. Ice cream was good too but not as good as Bi-Rite Salted caramel.
