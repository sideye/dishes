Loved those two items!\n\nHowever, I was deeply disappointed with the Green Onion Pancakes. These are by far the worst I have ever had. They claim they are homemade, but when I took a bite...the pancake was hard as a rock and VERY stale. These were either way overcooked, or a couple days old. Either way, they were impossible to eat. I tried to bend one and it snapped in half like a burnt cookie! I am shocked they would serve food in this condition. It was horrible.\n\nSince this order was for takeout, I was expecting some takeout utensils but there were none. No napkins, forks, or chopsticks. Just a couple packets of soy sauce. \n\nI really wanted to like this place because I needed a new Chinese takeout spot. But was extremely let down from the Green Onion Pancakes.

Instead it was chicken fried rice.\n\nI called immediatly to find out what the deal was and the person I spoke to told me it was on their menu in house as chicken fried rice. I was a bit upset as this was the main thing I wanted to eat. He handed me to his boss who told me to call the person who made the website?? I asked if there was anything they could do and all she said is if I bring it to the restaurant (not an easy task at the moment) she would refund me. Otherwise she would do nothing.\n\nShe promptly told me she was busy and had to go and then hung up the phone.\n\nNow I've had plenty of wrong orders before in my life and I really don't mind that much, I am a pretty friendly person. But the fact that they didn't care at all that I did not get what I was expecting and hung up on me really makes me upset. The least they could do is offer a replacement or give a discount. Anything other than rush me off the phone and basically tell me to \"deal with it\".\n\nI won't be ordering from here again.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-06-03"}], "vegetable dinner for": [], "mu shu meatless chicken": [], "mixed vegetable meatless chicken": [], "cashew nut meatless chicken": [], "spicy chef special thin noodle chow fun": [], "vegetable chow fun": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the Tofu with Garlic Sauce (Spicy), General Tso's Chicken, and the Spicy Vegetable Chow Fun.
