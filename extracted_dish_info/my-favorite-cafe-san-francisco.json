Inside a Chinese cafe, it's the usual hustle-bustle of a restaurant, but people can sit and chat for ages on end. The noise level can vary inside; nobody really thinks to be quiet at an Asian cafe. The atmosphere is more lively, casual, and less intimate.

Granted, I rarely ever drink until I get a hangover, but I've heard from many other peers about how greasy food is good for \"sopping up\" the alcohol from one's system.\n\nAside from the greasy brother, the meal itself was tasty and filling. Afterwards, I had dessert: sesame-filled dumplings. 5 cute mochi/rice ball dumplings in clear brother; the mochi had a good texture to it and had a hint of sweet saltiness. The servers were very generous in re-filling our cups with tea and letting Mellie P. and I sit at the cafe for 3 hours chatting.....\n\nThe clientele consisted of a mix of Asian/Asian-Americans.

But maybe the owners/servers get a similar joke at times?\n\nWell, last night was my first time going to My Favorite Cafe, and I must say I rather liked it. It was actually my first time to be in the Outer Richmond part of Clement Street, and I thought it was a lot calmer/local-centric than the Inner Richmond part of Clement. The inside of the cafe/restaurant is lit with hard fluorescent bulbs, so that gives off a different feel from most \"usual\" cafes. Don't come here if you expect to find a \"cozy, calm\" place to sit and read.\n\nI find that as I frequent more Chinese/Asian cafes, the ambience definitely differs a lot from the American POV of cafes. Inside a Chinese cafe, it's the usual hustle-bustle of a restaurant, but people can sit and chat for ages on end. The noise level can vary inside; nobody really thinks to be quiet at an Asian cafe. The atmosphere is more lively, casual, and less intimate. In some strange way, I find this all relaxing to me; it makes me really get a feeling of home.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review of My Favorite Cafe.\n\nThe menu at MFC is impressive; there are cafe specialties, sandwiches, noodles, hot AND cold desserts, and specialty drinks. All items are priced under $10, so one can definitely get a bargain bite at MFC. However, most of the foods are unhealthy, but...hey, sometimes it's okay to indulge.\n\nI ordered the curry fish ball with rice noodle for my meal; The curry fish balls were tender and had a kick of spice to them. I wasn't too happy to see the noodles and fish balls swimming in greasy/fatty broth, but I had to comment to my friend Mellie P. about how MFC seemed to be a \"good place to eat at to treat a hangover\". Granted, I rarely ever drink until I get a hangover, but I've heard from many other peers about how greasy food is good for \"sopping up\" the alcohol from one's system.\n\nAside from the greasy brother, the meal itself was tasty and filling. Afterwards, I had dessert: sesame-filled dumplings. 5 cute mochi/rice ball dumplings in clear brother; the mochi had a good texture to it and had a hint of sweet saltiness. The servers were very generous in re-filling our cups with tea and letting Mellie P. and I sit at the cafe for 3 hours chatting.....\n\nThe clientele consisted of a mix of Asian/Asian-Americans. MFC looks like a good place for families, party-goers, and young people alike. I'd love to live near a place like this, just knowing that I could pop in at midnight and order some food/dessert from them.\n\nI'm curious to try the \"stewed snow frog\" listed under both the hot and cold desserts sections. I will probably order that the next time I am back at My Favorite Cafe.\n\nOh, and I hate to say it, but I think \"My Favorite Cafe\" could very well become MY favorite cafe in the City. =P", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-12"}, {"excerpts": ["My group got some curry fish balls, nutella french toast, and the mango delight.  \n\n", "My friend thought the curry fish balls were a little too spicy for her and ordered some ice cream, and it came ON THE HOUSE! =]  \n\n", "My friend thought the curry fish balls were a little too spicy for her and ordered some ice cream, and it came ON THE HOUSE! =]  \n\n"], "author": "Rachelle T.", "review": "Maybe it was cravings for a good midnight snack or the company but I was satisfied with my whole experience here.

We started coming here so often for a spell that the owner would always say 'hi' when we walked in, immediately seat us, regardless of the hour, and would take our orders in a timely fashion. We've watched them turn people away who walked in right after us - now THAT'S service to loyal patrons! Another bonus about MFC is that they don't have a minimum (as far as I can tell) per person for ordering - which means you don't HAVE to get something even if your friends have the munchies; many places do have this kind of rule, and I find it to be stupid. Nicely done MFC.\n\nThey have a pretty basic setup; when you walk in, there are a row of tables to your right for smaller parties - say, less than 4, and some rounds pushed together for parties of 5 or more.

"], "author": "Helene K.", "review": "I bet others have already thought of a joke for My Favorite Cafe, but I could not help but imagine the following conversation after I went to My Favorite Cafe last night:\n\nPerson 1: Hey, do you want to go to My Favorite Cafe?\nPerson 2: Sure, what's the name of the place?\nPerson 1: My Favorite Cafe.\nPerson 2: I know it's your favorite cafe, but what's the name?\nPerson 1: My Favorite Cafe.\nPerson 2: Uh?\n\nOkay, maybe bad joke, sorry. But maybe the owners/servers get a similar joke at times?\n\nWell, last night was my first time going to My Favorite Cafe, and I must say I rather liked it. It was actually my first time to be in the Outer Richmond part of Clement Street, and I thought it was a lot calmer/local-centric than the Inner Richmond part of Clement. The inside of the cafe/restaurant is lit with hard fluorescent bulbs, so that gives off a different feel from most \"usual\" cafes. Don't come here if you expect to find a \"cozy, calm\" place to sit and read.\n\nI find that as I frequent more Chinese/Asian cafes, the ambience definitely differs a lot from the American POV of cafes. Inside a Chinese cafe, it's the usual hustle-bustle of a restaurant, but people can sit and chat for ages on end. The noise level can vary inside; nobody really thinks to be quiet at an Asian cafe. The atmosphere is more lively, casual, and less intimate. In some strange way, I find this all relaxing to me; it makes me really get a feeling of home.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review of My Favorite Cafe.\n\nThe menu at MFC is impressive; there are cafe specialties, sandwiches, noodles, hot AND cold desserts, and specialty drinks. All items are priced under $10, so one can definitely get a bargain bite at MFC. However, most of the foods are unhealthy, but...hey, sometimes it's okay to indulge.\n\nI ordered the curry fish ball with rice noodle for my meal; The curry fish balls were tender and had a kick of spice to them. I wasn't too happy to see the noodles and fish balls swimming in greasy/fatty broth, but I had to comment to my friend Mellie P. about how MFC seemed to be a \"good place to eat at to treat a hangover\". Granted, I rarely ever drink until I get a hangover, but I've heard from many other peers about how greasy food is good for \"sopping up\" the alcohol from one's system.\n\nAside from the greasy brother, the meal itself was tasty and filling. Afterwards, I had dessert: sesame-filled dumplings. 5 cute mochi/rice ball dumplings in clear brother; the mochi had a good texture to it and had a hint of sweet saltiness. The servers were very generous in re-filling our cups with tea and letting Mellie P. and I sit at the cafe for 3 hours chatting.....\n\nThe clientele consisted of a mix of Asian/Asian-Americans. MFC looks like a good place for families, party-goers, and young people alike. I'd love to live near a place like this, just knowing that I could pop in at midnight and order some food/dessert from them.\n\nI'm curious to try the \"stewed snow frog\" listed under both the hot and cold desserts sections. I will probably order that the next time I am back at My Favorite Cafe.\n\nOh, and I hate to say it, but I think \"My Favorite Cafe\" could very well become MY favorite cafe in the City. =P", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-12"}], "deep fried fish ball": [], "plain fish ball": [], "pork chop and egg noodle": [], "chefs pick noodle": [], "tossed noodle": [{"excerpts": ["Their \"My Favorite Cafe Tossed Noodle\" is SO GOOD !

There were 6 of us, so they put us at a big table in the front next to the window. As soon as we sat down, everything felt... sticky. The table, the chairs, probably even the walls if we dared to touch them. After the worker placed the menus on the table, we literally had to peel them off.\n\nWe glanced through the menu and saw an assortment of delicious-sounding desserts. Steamed egg custard, steamed milk custard, sesame paste, egg puffs, blended fruit drinks. I wanted to try their milk tea pudding, but they were out. Boo. My mom wanted to try their black sesame paste, but they were also all out of that. But they had enough to make two servings of the steamed egg custard with sesame paste... wait, what? (They're also supposed to be open until midnight or so? And they're out of these staples already?)

Even though the front door was open, there was zero air flow at the table we were seated at. And it was next to a window, so the sunshine that filtered in was magnified. It was like sitting in a greenhouse. We thought about asking to move, but that was their only large table, so we would all have to split up. It was a family outing, so... no dice on that.\n\nThe desserts came, and yeah, they were pretty good. (Except the mango smoothie... can someone say syrup overload?) We tried to eat as fast as we could so we wouldn't melt, but we also didn't want to burn our tongues on the hot food. Dilemmaaaaa. We eventually made it through, paid our bill, and rolled out. We interacted with the worker a total of six times: when she told us where to sit, when she set the menus down, when she took our order, when she gave us our bill, when she returned for the bill, and when she returned to give us the receipt. No friendly service here.\n\nSo, My Favorite Cafe? Not really. I would much rather go to one of the many other HK dessert shops in the Richmond area.

"], "author": "Yvonne K.", "review": "The food is decent, but the ambience and service have a lot to be desired.\n\nWe came in around 4PM on a Saturday afternoon, looking for an afternoon delight/pick-me-up in the form of some tasty HK-style desserts. There were 6 of us, so they put us at a big table in the front next to the window. As soon as we sat down, everything felt... sticky. The table, the chairs, probably even the walls if we dared to touch them. After the worker placed the menus on the table, we literally had to peel them off.\n\nWe glanced through the menu and saw an assortment of delicious-sounding desserts. Steamed egg custard, steamed milk custard, sesame paste, egg puffs, blended fruit drinks. I wanted to try their milk tea pudding, but they were out. Boo. My mom wanted to try their black sesame paste, but they were also all out of that. But they had enough to make two servings of the steamed egg custard with sesame paste... wait, what? (They're also supposed to be open until midnight or so? And they're out of these staples already?) We shrugged and just let it go and ended up ordering two steamed egg custards with sesame paste, a mango smoothie, sesame egg puffs, and momo chacha (a dessert with taro chunks, yams, sago, and coconut milk).\n\nAs we waited, we began regretting the fact that we ordered pretty much all hot desserts. Even though the front door was open, there was zero air flow at the table we were seated at. And it was next to a window, so the sunshine that filtered in was magnified. It was like sitting in a greenhouse. We thought about asking to move, but that was their only large table, so we would all have to split up. It was a family outing, so... no dice on that.\n\nThe desserts came, and yeah, they were pretty good. (Except the mango smoothie... can someone say syrup overload?) We tried to eat as fast as we could so we wouldn't melt, but we also didn't want to burn our tongues on the hot food. Dilemmaaaaa. We eventually made it through, paid our bill, and rolled out. We interacted with the worker a total of six times: when she told us where to sit, when she set the menus down, when she took our order, when she gave us our bill, when she returned for the bill, and when she returned to give us the receipt. No friendly service here.\n\nSo, My Favorite Cafe? Not really. I would much rather go to one of the many other HK dessert shops in the Richmond area. The food here is decent, so I'm bumping them up to three stars, but the shoddy environment kills the good taste.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["My cousin got the mixed fruit with milk tea pudding.

Immediately I noticed the awkward dim lighting and messy tables. I would think since it's not that crowded, they would try to clean up a bit. We sat down at the least dirtiest table since no one told us where to sit.

The condensed milk and chocolate shavings on top was a good effort but that ran out quick. \n\nMixed Fruit with Tapicoa and Mango Juice - This was much better. The mango juice was very sugary but had a nice, thick mango puree consistency.

There was an atomic ice cream bowl or something and our guy friends HAD to order that for the girls. It came with a scoop of green tea ice cream, chocolate, strawberry, mango, and I think the last was vanilla. We totally couldn't finish that. It was TOO big and too much.

Even the guys couldn't finish the rest. Everything was pretty okay. Nothing really to wow about but then again I'm not really a big fan of Asian desserts. Probably a good place to just sit and have dessert with a couple of friends.

The service was fairly spot on with tea brought by with regularity and tables being cleared immediately after patrons left the cafe.\n\nThe green tea shake was a little strange.

(They're also supposed to be open until midnight or so? And they're out of these staples already?)

Even though the front door was open, there was zero air flow at the table we were seated at. And it was next to a window, so the sunshine that filtered in was magnified. It was like sitting in a greenhouse. We thought about asking to move, but that was their only large table, so we would all have to split up. It was a family outing, so... no dice on that.\n\nThe desserts came, and yeah, they were pretty good. (Except the mango smoothie... can someone say syrup overload?) We tried to eat as fast as we could so we wouldn't melt, but we also didn't want to burn our tongues on the hot food. Dilemmaaaaa. We eventually made it through, paid our bill, and rolled out. We interacted with the worker a total of six times: when she told us where to sit, when she set the menus down, when she took our order, when she gave us our bill, when she returned for the bill, and when she returned to give us the receipt. No friendly service here.\n\nSo, My Favorite Cafe? Not really. I would much rather go to one of the many other HK dessert shops in the Richmond area.
