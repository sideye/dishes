But no taqueria has failed to meet my expectations as much as this place. To be clear: this is the worst Mexican restaurant I've eaten at in San Francisco.\n\nLet's start with my drink: a margarita. All wrong. These are the classic elements of this beautiful drink: tequila, triple sec, and lemon/lime juice. When mixed together in the right proportions, they are fantastic. My margarita tasted mostly like lemon juice and sweetener (maybe agave syrup). If that sounds like lemonade to you, it's because it tasted like lemonade to me. Served in a tall 16oz glass filled to the rim, I couldn't detect the tequila because the cocktail had been so diluted. This is amateur hour. Not to mention that it took a good 10 minutes for my boyfriend and I to even get our drinks in the first place--after we were served our food.\n\nOh yeah, the food. My Al pastor burrito was a mess. While the pork was marinated, it had such a weak texture that it might have been microwaved. Served with a heavy dose of refried black beans and rice, there was nothing stand-out about a burrito that cost $12.\n\nI'm lucky that I didn't order the quesadilla. My boyfriend had a chicken quesadilla filled with sauteed onion slices. The chicken was bland.\n\nThe restaurant tries way too hard to present an upscale ambiance. It's just pretentious.

After picking my copy of Rupi Kaur's Milk & Honey from The Booksmith, we were hungry and looking for a Mexican restaurant in the area that would satisfy our cravings.

I had heard that it was not only a little hipster but also healthy, organic, with a focus on offering sustainable and wholesome Mexican food without sacrificing taste. That was something I could get behind!\n\nWalking in, the ambiance and concept of the restaurant was lovely! I loved the dimly lit lights and the whole atmosphere of the place. The place can get crowded on weekends and nights, but make sure to order before you take a seat! We ordered the al pastor and garlic shrimp burritos and a large serving ($1) for chips. \n\nI loved the salsa here. If anything, come here for chips and salsa!! The salsa flavors are incredibly dimensional and delicious. There's even labels and spicy levels. I really enjoyed the roasted one and the green one. You can really taste the difference in these tortilla chips. They taste healthier, cleaner and less oily, which I loved!!\n\nAl pastor burrito: I enjoyed this one more than I expected. The flavor was alright but it wasn't ohmygod amazing like so many other places Mexican places I've been to. The meat was probably the standout part of this dish but it still wasn't spectacular. The flavor didn't strike me as unique or flavorful. To me, it was actually kind of bland. The overall taste of this burrito was just average, nothing that I would ever crave or return for.\n\nGarlic shrimp burrito: Okay, I really really wanted to like this one.

"], "author": "Robert F.", "review": "I've had a loooooot of Mexican food in San Francisco since moving here. This city has a rich Mexican heritage, and the food testifies to it. But no taqueria has failed to meet my expectations as much as this place. To be clear: this is the worst Mexican restaurant I've eaten at in San Francisco.\n\nLet's start with my drink: a margarita. All wrong. These are the classic elements of this beautiful drink: tequila, triple sec, and lemon/lime juice. When mixed together in the right proportions, they are fantastic. My margarita tasted mostly like lemon juice and sweetener (maybe agave syrup). If that sounds like lemonade to you, it's because it tasted like lemonade to me. Served in a tall 16oz glass filled to the rim, I couldn't detect the tequila because the cocktail had been so diluted. This is amateur hour. Not to mention that it took a good 10 minutes for my boyfriend and I to even get our drinks in the first place--after we were served our food.\n\nOh yeah, the food. My Al pastor burrito was a mess. While the pork was marinated, it had such a weak texture that it might have been microwaved. Served with a heavy dose of refried black beans and rice, there was nothing stand-out about a burrito that cost $12.\n\nI'm lucky that I didn't order the quesadilla. My boyfriend had a chicken quesadilla filled with sauteed onion slices. The chicken was bland.\n\nThe restaurant tries way too hard to present an upscale ambiance. It's just pretentious. It's like the owners walked into Troipsue\u00f1o and decided to copy everything except the delicious menu. This overpriced establishment can't compare with Nopalito, which is less than a few blocks away, or El Rancho Grande, which is worth the walk from here.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I paid $12 for a bland al pastor burrito and they have the nerve to charge for a small bowl of chips.

Their site says they charge an extra $1.50 to get your burrito smothered, but Forkable didn't note that extra charge. I guess that's better as they smothered my burrito with green chile instead of the red sauce. Was a little bummed because of that.

While a carne asada super burrito here is a little pricier than your average Mission taqueria, it's made with quality ingredients and its size is pretty comparable to, say, El Farolito or Taqueria Can-Cun.  The nachos here are also large and there's no skimping on sour cream, guacamole, beans and meat.  However, be warned that \"smoky chile sauce\" is served on top of the nachos, which has kind of that weird chipotle flavor.  I don't like my nachos to taste like someone just poured liquid smoke in the beans, so I always ask for no sauce and am cheerfully obliged.\n\nBoth the agave wine margarita and sangria here are available by the glass or in carafes and are so ridiculously delicious that I'm considering stopping this review mid-sentence and going to get my drink on.  The agave wine margarita is particularly tasty.  Since it's made with agave wine rather than tequila and comes with orange slices mixed in, it takes on a more subtle, sweet flavor than a traditional margarita, which is a refreshing change.  At $18 a carafe, which works out to roughly four glasses, that's less than $5 a drink for you and your friends -- or, if you're like me, just little old you, relaxing at 3:45 p.m. on a weekday, savoring each sip of margarita and each bite of burrito.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Try the Agave Wine Margarita.

You bite into it and it's just heaven without overly relying on cheese / guac / sour cream to get there.

The chef sautes the fresh veggies while you wait.. even does the ignite-the-pan-oil flambe flip move to give them a nice char. You won't even miss the meat. Major props for doing that one right and not just as an afterthought.\n\nOther highlights include the super healthy, light and delicious tortilla soup. I enjoy the horchata, not the best on the planet but made fresh daily with a nice little grit to it. Fine little beer and wine selection too, stuff I actually drink.\n\nBut watch out, the tacos were really disappointing. Just a pile of meat on some cabbage. High quality meat, but very mildly seasoned and quite bland. And with the notable exception of the super fresh pico de gallo, the salsas were also bland.

Very average \n\nMy wife tried the breakfast tacos which was a bad decision because it had the same ingredients as my burrito.\n\nTo summarize my experience, the decor and ambience for this place is good, the salsas were yummy and the chips were crunchy, the servings are generous. However the burritos and tacos didnt quite deliver the punch that I was expecting after seeing all the reviews for this place. \n\nNext time I may try the plantain or the veggie burrito or tacos and update my review.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-12-13"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the breakfast tacos.

Who knew that we would actually beat the crowds by going at noon on a Sunday???

And even more perfect with some of the great salsas they have to choose from. \n\nAlmost looking forward to my next hangover!", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-11-23"}], "sightglass coffee": [], "assorted tea": [], "passion fruit mimosa": [{"excerpts": ["I had the huevos motulenos (basically a breakfast tostada with eggs and ham) and a passion fruit mimosa.
