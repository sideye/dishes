(yes it has happened at another thai restaurant and i am not going to name names because the manager apologized profusely and i ended up getting my order for free).\n\nthe food is solid. and more often than not, better than solid.  some of my favorites are\n\nappetizers:\nbasil tofu, crispy tofu and spring rolls.  i prefer the crispy tofu over the basil tofu, but if you are a fan of thai basil then i strongly suggest the basil tofu.  sometimes the crispy tofu is a little dry, but i actually like that with this tofu. for some reason it sops up the sweet and sour and peanut sauce a little bit better.  the fresh spring rolls are fantastic and a great way to tantalize the palate with many different flavors before your main course.\n\nsalad\nthe only salad i have ever had was the ppy salad. wow! so good! if you like papaya then this is the salad for you. so fresh. so tasty. so simple. \n\nsoups\ntom yum: the quintessential thai soup done very well here. \nseafood tom yum: when you are feeling a little more adventurous get the seafood version. its pretty expensive at around 11 bucks, but if you are in the mood for a more protein filled version of the soup this is the way to go.\n\nnoodles/rice:\ni have had the pad thai (i know-so boring). but honestly it is rather good here. sometimes the noodles come a little clumpy and i can only assume this is because it has been sitting around for like 20 minutes. but it is still tasty.\n\npineapple fried rice: a must order. i get it every time. it is so good and the pineapple perfectly offsets the salty nature of the fried rice. add cashews and perfectly cooked onions and this is some of the best fried rice i have had. oh yea it also comes with chicken and shrimp!\n\ngreen curry fried rice: tasty but rather simple. not much going on. but then again once you taste the pineapple fried rice i doubt you will try any other.\n\nentrees:\nsauteed eggplant: really great flavors. the only problem is sometimes the eggplant comes a tiny bit mushy because it is overcooked and then sits in a delivery bag for 20 more minutes.\n\ncurries: i have had almost all the curries (save for the pumpkin curry). they are all rather solid. i prefer the red or mango red. overall i dont think you will be disappointed with the curries. not as good as some thai restaurants i have been to, but definitely not bottom of class either.\n\nmy top recommendations are:\ncrispy tofu, ppy salad, seafood tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice, sauteed eggplant.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-03-25"}], "tom yum fried rice": [{"excerpts": ["I had Tom Yum Fried rice (not very spicy, was ok), Black Sweet Rice with Mango (very good:), and Coppa Caffe (should've tried modern Thai sundae instead...).

When Thai food was brought into the conversation, I couldn't help but give a nod of encouragement.  We ended up on Polk Street at Modern Thai.  They've got a bright patio area up in front, but it can be a little chilly and loud from the street traffic, so we opted to sit inside.  We realized that it was Mother's Day, and the restaurant seemed deserted.  We figured that most people wouldn't take their beloved moms to the TL for a celebratory dinner.  Good for us, I guess!  We had the main dining room to ourselves for the better part of an hour.  I liked the ambiance, with its vibrant lime and fuchsia accent walls and its high ceilings.  It was simply yet elegantly appointed.  \n\nThe food was good, but not extraordinary.  Since there were 5 of us who were game for eating family style we had a chance to sample a variety of dishes, including Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Mango Curry with Chicken, Eggplant and Tofu, Scallops over Bok Choy, and Papaya Salad.  One of my dining companions whom I had just met earlier that day was Thai and thought that most of the dishes were too sweet for her tastes.  I was very liberal with my usage of the hot peppers, so I didn't really find sweetness to be an issue.   \n\nWe also tried the mango and black sticky rice and the blueberry roti for dessert.  \n\nOverall, it was a pleasant meal, but I think I'll probably be inclined to be adventurous and try my luck with another restaurant in the area.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-05-12"}, {"excerpts": ["well, i love the blueberry roti too!

It was a toss between here and the busy Chai-Yo down the street and I have no regrets for making the right choice.\n\nThe interior reminded me of Macau for some odd reason but it's very cozy somewhat upscale but not too up scale. Since it wasn't packed like the other place, it was definitely the good choice.\n\nWe started out with appetizers, we ordered the fried wonton, chicken satay, and hoi jor. Fabulous I must say! Though the fried wonton was a little too fried, my boyfriend enjoyed it. Love the chicken satay, the sauce was a mix of peanut sauce and ginger and the chicken was not dry (like King of Thai) but very juicy! The hoi joi, definitely better than other Thai places I've been to; the meat was packed and it fit well with the plum sauce. \n\nOur drinks were Thai Ice Tea, not much to say about this one since they're the same-ish to me. It wasn't too sweet which is the way I like it.\n\nOur entree was chicken Pad See Ew, the veggies were cooked but it was still fresh crunchy cooked, the noodles were not too sweet and not too salty. The chicken, very juicy indeed! Mmm one of the best I've had in Thai food.\n\nWe wrapped up our meal with a special order of Strawberry, Banana, Blueberry roti. I'm not much of a fan of blueberries but I liked it!. \n\nThe service at Modern Thai is very warm and friendly. The decorations in the restaurant looks upscale but food is moderately inexpensive (which is a +). Food presentation was also very neat and classy. The bathroom, very clean! \n\nOverall, if you want really good Thai food with great service and food presentation, I highly suggestion going to Modern Thai. Best of all, it is inexpensive! The food and service was worth more than the price. I sense that we will come back here often =P.\n\nEdit: 10/10/07\nWe've came here about four times now, each time on Mondays after Youth Commission for me and the service and food has still been great!

I ordered Tom Yum soup, hot tea and coconut shrimp. These three items came out to $30. Which would have been fine if any one of these things had been good, but ALL of them had issues. And that isn't even the only issue I had with this visit.\n\nFirst, when I arrived there was only one other party there. A party of about 6 people that grew every half an hour as one of the marina-types rolled their drunk asses out of bed to stroll in \"fashionably late\" to their friend's birthday dinner. They were loud and obnoxious, but that doesn't explain why I had to wait 20 minutes for someone to ask if me I was ready to order especially since I knew what I wanted before I sat down. And there were THREE people working there -- a waiter and two waitresses. It looked like the women were intimidated by the loud group and mostly just the waiter dealt with them.\n\nLet's talk about the coconut shrimp. A dish I have ordered many times. At least half of the time I come here or order delivery, this dish is ordered. It is even in my first review of this place: http://bit.ly/1a8dsUX I love this dish, it's shrimp and coconut fried together what's not to love? Well what I don't love is biting in to raw shrimp. Not undercooked, but still translucent RAW shrimp. But what I really don't love is when I spit it out on a plate (they give you cloth napkins so I couldn't discretely spit it out into a napkin) and push it to the far side of the table and it takes someone a full 15 minutes to ask me if there is something wrong. The waitress did have the kitchen re-fry the shrimp to cook it through but by the time it came back my soup was ready and I was kind of skeptical about trying it again.\n\nNow the tea. It's hot water and tea bags. You would think it is impossible to get terribly wrong right? But you'd be wrong...  For some unknown reason they sweeten their ice tea when they brew it so I couldn't just get regular hot thai tea. Instead they heated the pre-sweetened iced tea which was way too freakin sweet. Think southern food sweet tea with another pound of sugar in it. The waitress did offer to dilute it with hot water (why she didn't just make it with half plain water and half tea to begin with is beyond me) but it was still way more sugar than I , or any person who is over the age of 5, would normally consume.\n\nLastly the Tom Yum soup with noodles. This is the only thai restaurant I've been to where this dish is not technically on the menu. Here they are essentially giving you an order of tom yum soup with a side order of noodles, which is odd because they have a whole menu section of noodle soups and all of those soups are fairly bland (Even the Starbucks of SF thai food, Osha Thai has this dish). This was the closest to being perfect, but it was supposed to be chicken but I got shrimp. Not a big deal since I obviously like shrimp and at least these shrimp were cooked. And because this is a side order of noodles, there were way too many noodles in soup. There was also an odd soapy after taste to the noodles.\n\nThe waitress, when she did notice issues, did an admirable job of trying to correct the problem. But it took her much too long to react. Unfortunately, this comedy of errors was just not funny when all I wanted was some hot spicy soup and some hot tea to clear my allergy-induced congestion and it took twice as long for me to get half the quality of food and one third the level of service I had come to expect from this place.

My mother-in-law got the basil Thai fried rice and it was delicious with my hubby's chicken. ;)  I had a side of steamed veggies, and they were perfectly done, if a little bland.\n\nMy only complaint was that there wasn't anything on the tables like chili sauce or soy sauce or peppers.  I got the feeling that you weren't supposed to ask for things like that.  I can understand why, I guess, sometimes I want things a little spicier than they come.\n\nNext time I'm wanting Thai food, I'm coming here.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-08-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Dishes include pad thai, chicken noodle soup, and thai fried rice to name a few.. but my favorite is the sauteed eggplant (also in the lunch special) \n\n"], "author": "Jen L.", "review": "Reasonable prices, pretty good proportions and  yummy food! \n\nThey have a lunch special that includes a lot of food priced a bit cheaper than dinner from 11-4 on weekdays and from 12-4 on weekends.

Many of the dishes are pretty standard Thai fare (pad thai, yellow curry, and pad see ew, for example, are going to be about what you'd get anywhere), but they have a few standouts: I love their crispy calamari stir-fry with cashews, and they use a special kind of brown rice with fat, almost purple-colored grains that's really delicious. They have a beef noodle soup that's kind of like pho, with a Thai twist I guess, and their barbeque pork soup with dumplings and egg noodles is super hangover food. They have lunch specials too.\n\nSo basically, what would be a three-star restaurant gets an extra star for lovely ambiance, very good service, and a few extras on the menu that make it worth a trip.
