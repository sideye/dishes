The dining profile was young, mostly Asian, and likely working at start-ups nearby judging from the Ben Sherman vibe of their clothing.\n\nI was seated straight away on a lonely banquette table and perused their rather lengthy menu to see what I could get away with for dinner. I also learned the literal translation of Saap Ver was 'Damn Delicious'. OK, fair enough. I started with the $8 Fresh Rolls, purely vegetarian with an extra thin rice paper wrapper and an extra thick peanut sauce. They were stuffed with lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, carrot, vermicelli noodles, and tofu (photo: http://bit.ly/2FQHoPV). Damn, it was delicious though not entirely unique in execution. My main event was the $12 Chicken Ginger Rice, their take on Hainan chicken which I dared to ask if I could have paleo.\n\nThe server asked the chef who refused as he felt the rice was the point of ordering the dish. It was indeed as the plump chicken thigh was resting on top of a large mound of ginger-infused rice with cucumber slices and soy sauce on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2pioeZd). The poultry was tender and just what I wanted as it was boneless but not skinless. I added a $5 side of Steamed Broccoli in order to make it more paleo, and it worked for the most part since the veg was fresh (photo: http://bit.ly/2HC86t4).

Saap Ver has more of a lively bar vibe that was reminiscent of the nightlife in Thailand. Retro decor. Casual, energetic ambiance.\n\nThe menu is very extensive here, like most Thai restaurants, and can be a little overwhelming. Unlike other Thai places I've been to, they have some more regional dishes that I don't normally see on menus like khao kha moo (five spices pork leg). The prices are very reasonable here, especially given it's SF, and they don't skimp on portion sizes to compensate. \n\nWe ordered 4 dishes between the 3 of us and it was more than plenty. I found the more \"American\" dishes like pad thai and curry to be disappointing while the less commonly ordered som tom and BBQ chicken tasted more authentic in flavor. I'd come back to try more of their regional dishes!\n\n* SOM TOM GRILLED PRAWNS ($13) - 4.5/5\n[green papaya salad, chili, cherry tomato, green bean, ground peanut, grilled prawn, fish sauce]\nVery well balanced papaya salad! Spicy, acidic, salty and sweet - just like in Thailand. My only disappointment was that there was literally just one grilled prawn, sliced into two halves.\n\n* BBQ CHICKEN ($12) - 4/5\n[thai style bbq chicken with sweet chili sauce]\nSolid. Came with 4 large pieces of chicken - 2 drumsticks and 1 thigh cut into 2 pieces - served with a sweet chili dipping sauce as well as a salty/fish chili dipping sauce. The meat wasn't the best I've had in texture and was a little dry at spots, but the skin was crispy and it was a generous portion for the price.\n\n* PAD THAI HOR KAI ($16) - 3/5\n[egg wrap pad thai - pan-fried rice noodle, prawn, peanut, bean sprouts]\nDisappointing. I had this in Bangkok and haven't seen it anywhere in SF except Saap Ver, so I was eager to try it. I honestly wasn't expecting it to be anything like the one I had in Bangkok, but their pad thai really fell short. The noodles were too chewy and stuck together in clumps, and the flavor was too sweet.\n\n* YELLOW CURRY WITH BEEF ($12) - 3/5\n[curry powder, turmeric, coconut milk, potato, carrot, yellow onion]\nStandard curry flavor. We got ours medium spicy but it tasted very mild to me. The potato, carrots and onion were tender soft, but the texture of the beef was tough and chewy. Felt like cheap cuts, but at least they were pretty generous with the amount of it. Maybe go with a different protein, but nothing special about the curry itself.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-19"}], "roasted pork with crispy pork belly": [{"excerpts": ["Roasted Pork with Crispy Pork Belly\n   over rice\n   Chinese sausage\n   "], "author": "S.K.

Our poor server wasn't familiar with the menu (who would be at 100+ items!) and had to confirm our order three separate times. I don't expect stellar service at Asian restaurants but I expected some follow-up since we were paying auto-gratuity for a large group and prices are higher than the standard Thai restaurant. No one checked on us to see how the food was and we had to constantly flag someone down when we needed something. We asked for hot sauce for the table and they gave us a small communal rack of hot sauces. They later asked to take it away when we were STILL using it. That's like having one set of ketchup and mustard bottles at a diner! \n\nAt the end of dinner, the staff brought the birthday boy coconut ice cream with a candle in it and sang happy birthday for him.

Saap Ver has more of a lively bar vibe that was reminiscent of the nightlife in Thailand. Retro decor. Casual, energetic ambiance.\n\nThe menu is very extensive here, like most Thai restaurants, and can be a little overwhelming. Unlike other Thai places I've been to, they have some more regional dishes that I don't normally see on menus like khao kha moo (five spices pork leg). The prices are very reasonable here, especially given it's SF, and they don't skimp on portion sizes to compensate. \n\nWe ordered 4 dishes between the 3 of us and it was more than plenty. I found the more \"American\" dishes like pad thai and curry to be disappointing while the less commonly ordered som tom and BBQ chicken tasted more authentic in flavor. I'd come back to try more of their regional dishes!\n\n* SOM TOM GRILLED PRAWNS ($13) - 4.5/5\n[green papaya salad, chili, cherry tomato, green bean, ground peanut, grilled prawn, fish sauce]\nVery well balanced papaya salad! Spicy, acidic, salty and sweet - just like in Thailand. My only disappointment was that there was literally just one grilled prawn, sliced into two halves.\n\n* BBQ CHICKEN ($12) - 4/5\n[thai style bbq chicken with sweet chili sauce]\nSolid. Came with 4 large pieces of chicken - 2 drumsticks and 1 thigh cut into 2 pieces - served with a sweet chili dipping sauce as well as a salty/fish chili dipping sauce. The meat wasn't the best I've had in texture and was a little dry at spots, but the skin was crispy and it was a generous portion for the price.\n\n* PAD THAI HOR KAI ($16) - 3/5\n[egg wrap pad thai - pan-fried rice noodle, prawn, peanut, bean sprouts]\nDisappointing. I had this in Bangkok and haven't seen it anywhere in SF except Saap Ver, so I was eager to try it. I honestly wasn't expecting it to be anything like the one I had in Bangkok, but their pad thai really fell short. The noodles were too chewy and stuck together in clumps, and the flavor was too sweet.\n\n* YELLOW CURRY WITH BEEF ($12) - 3/5\n[curry powder, turmeric, coconut milk, potato, carrot, yellow onion]\nStandard curry flavor. We got ours medium spicy but it tasted very mild to me. The potato, carrots and onion were tender soft, but the texture of the beef was tough and chewy. Felt like cheap cuts, but at least they were pretty generous with the amount of it. Maybe go with a different protein, but nothing special about the curry itself.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-19"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the pad thai hor kai, tom yum soup, crispy larb wontons and the fresh rolls.

And Saap Ver has that down to a tee. \n\nDecor - reminder of all the fun, street style of Thailand (without the dirty street feels)\n\nWait staff - first visit really disappointed me. My friend had to apologize to me several times saying she'd never seen the restaurant that busy before. Our waitress didn't bring us our menus for a while. Or water. And forgot the main dish we order...the salted fish, which takes a bit longer to make. To be fair, they were catering a 20+ bday party, plus everyone else that night. It did seem busier than usual. \nWhich is why I decided to give them a second chance. The second visit was the best! The waitress was attentive, informative, and extremely friendly. The restaurant was also a lot less busy that night. \n\nFood - the star of the show! Dishes I tried were the whole grilled salted fish (twice), Tom yum seafood fried rice, papaya salad (mild), and the Po tak soup. Get the salted fish!! Don't walk. RUN! It's that good.

Street parking was plentiful. \n\nI appreciate having lots of choices but the 100+ item menu was daunting because most items can't be found in your cookie cutter Thai restaurant like King of Thai or Osha. The menu lacks organization; i.e. soup was listed in 3 different sections. There's also two other boards of \"chef specials\" with another 20+ items which made things even more overwhelming.

Our poor server wasn't familiar with the menu (who would be at 100+ items!) and had to confirm our order three separate times. I don't expect stellar service at Asian restaurants but I expected some follow-up since we were paying auto-gratuity for a large group and prices are higher than the standard Thai restaurant. No one checked on us to see how the food was and we had to constantly flag someone down when we needed something. We asked for hot sauce for the table and they gave us a small communal rack of hot sauces. They later asked to take it away when we were STILL using it. That's like having one set of ketchup and mustard bottles at a diner! \n\nAt the end of dinner, the staff brought the birthday boy coconut ice cream with a candle in it and sang happy birthday for him.

The restaurant was not very busy when we arrived as 1/3 of the tables were empty. You might think you will get better service as the restaurant is not busy. Think again! The service was very low. We got there by 1:10PM and the food wasn't ready until 1:50PM. Also, the food was very disappointing. I ordered Roast Duck Over Rice and the dish is barely warm. Also, the roast duck has very strong propane taste. One of my co-worker ordered Garlic Pepper Pork, and she said the food was extremely salty.

This is one of their favorite Thai spots in the city. \n\nThe vibe and decor at this place was pretty fun. They must have been pretty short staffed the night I came because when I walked in, I had to wait several minutes for someone to come greet and seat me. \n\nMy friends recommended this cocktail they'd had there before that had some kind of lemongrass infused liquor and chili vodka or something, but they said they'd be discontinuing that drink so we were pretty bummed. \n\nWe started with the fresh rolls to start which were fresh and tasty. \n\nFor my main I had the pumpkin and tofu curry with garlic ginger rice. The curry was thick and decadent, but could've had a bit more pumpkin in it. \n\nOne friend ordered the saut\u00e9ed beef with string beans which was super tasty and well seasoned. I would get that again. \n\nMy other friend had the spicy sizzling seafood which was ok but kind of underwhelming. She loved it but I thought the ingredients were not super well incorporated. \n\nTheir dishes also came out about 10 minutes after mine so timing could've been a bit better. Prices were average for what you can normally find in SF.
