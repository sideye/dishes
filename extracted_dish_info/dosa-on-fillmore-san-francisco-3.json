My personal favorite was the automatic door in the front. Definitely a nice surprise.\n\nService (4/5): Our server was extremely sweet. She was very patient with our decision-making process on what to order as well as checking in with us from time to time. I did like how since we did order more than our table could hold, she actually staggered the meals so that we could have ample space to enjoy one, and promptly have the next one as soon as we finished. Also, another kind gentlemen came by for our drink orders while we were waiting to be seated. How rad is that to be treated well even before your seated.\n\nFood (4/5): We shared the idli fries, sweet potato dosa, and lambed keema dosa. The fries were coated with this powder, which had a nice kick to it. The sweet potato dosa came out first and I loved the presentation. The sweet potato filling was hidden inside the nicely wrapped dosa. I liked the sponginess of the dosa, rather than the crispy sections. But that's just my preference. The sweet potato still had a savory flavor to them that I really enjoy. Plus the chutneys that came on the side also was a nice touch. We were pretty full by the time the lamb keema came out. I was a tad disappointed since the lamb was really finely diced, so you don't get the texture of the meat, but you can still taste it. It was a bit spicy, but we did enjoy it as well.\n\nDrinks (4/5): I normally don't order drinks, but somtimes you have to treat yo'self. Being a huge Warriors fan, I knew I had to go with the Steph Curry. My gf also ordered the mango is the new black. I will say these drinks are strong, so you do get your moneys worth. But I did enjoy both drinks and I could see why Steph Curry has been one of their more popular drinks.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["The idli and vada was cold and horrible.

", "I tried only one of those. ", "It was descent. ", "I think it should have been spicier inside. "], "author": "Ishfaq H.", "review": "First of all, it's a pretty classy place. In most cases, when I'm craving for Indian food, I would prefer a place that is bustling with noise, peoples' chat and so on (I grew up in Bangladesh and I value this sort of lively noise :) ). But if you want to enjoy Indian food in a classy way for a special event, this place does a pretty good job. We were a group of 5 people and thus got to try out many different dishes. For appetizers, I thought Vada Pav was EXCELLENT. It's like a slider with spiced potato patty inside. As you can imagine, the way you make the patty is the most crucial thing here and I felt one can't do better than this! But my only negative feeling was the slider bun was a bit too oily and I felt a little bit of discomfort when I was holding it. But overall I would give A+ on this dish.\nMy friend tried out Idli fries. I tried only one of those. It was descent. I think it should have been spicier inside. I felt it was a bit blunt. \n\nFor the main dish, I had Paneer and Peas Dosa. It was really good. The paneer was crunchy and along with the chutneys, it was marvelous. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Make sure you have this with both the coconut and the tomato chutney together. The samber, that came along with this, was also excellent. It was spicy as it should be and the thickness of the curry was optimal. BTW, when you are having dishes like dosa, upattam, just avoid too much use of silverwares. Indian foods, especially foods of this kind, are meant to be eaten by hand and if you need to concentrate too much on the fork and knife to have these delicate dishes, your mind won't have the time to savor the taste :)\n\nAfter all these, we had the legendary Madras Coffee. I didn't know much about it but my friend, whose family is from South India, commented, \"you judge a South Indian restaurant by it's Madras coffee\". It was my first time having Madras coffee, and being a huge fan of coffee, I must say, this is one of the best kind of coffees I have ever had. So, if you come here GET this coffee. But there is one thing I think Dosa can improve on. They gave the coffee in British style cups and that made the coffee lukewarm. Even though I really liked the coffee, my friend's parents (expert on Madras coffee) and I think it would have tasted MUCH better if it were super hot. They also explained to me that in India, people serve this coffee on metal cups in traditional ways. Given the classy level of this restaurant, I think Dosa should put effort to serve this South Indian signature coffee in more traditional way!\n\nFor dessert, we had Rasmalai, Panna Cotta and House-made Gelato and Sorbet. Bangladesh and India are known for their famous sweet dishes and when I was in Bangladesh, rasmalai was my MOST favorite sweet dish. If you don't try rasmalai in your lifetime, you will regret even after you die and the rasmalai at Dosa was EXCELLENT. The sweet cheese patties were optimally soft, juicy and when you pour that in your mouth, you just feel that juicy cream coming out of the patty. Just close your eyes and fill that moment! \n\nWhile the rasmalai was great, we all felt the panna cotta was terrible mostly due the \"spicy\" taste in it. In India/Bangladesh, all the desserts are known for it's sweetness and adding sambal chili in the panna cotta just ruined it. When you pour it in your mouth, you don't fill the spicy taste first but as you swallow it, the spiciness kicks in the throat and it's just weird and just ruins the dessert mood. The gelato was good but nothing special. It was more like a \"Kulfi\" in Bangladesh/India. But lastly, I would just say that, if you come here and crave for dessert after you meal, just go with the rasmalai. You can never go wrong with it, especially when you are at Dosa.\n\nAs far as the restaurant environment goes, it was pretty nice and relaxing. I really liked the overall design, decoration and lighting of the place. It's also duplex and from top it looks beautiful. My only complaint was some of the camera photographs hanging on the walls. Most of those are pictures of poor, struggling working people in India and even though the pictures represent the true picture of the majority in  the Indian sub-continent, I just felt hanging these pictures in a rich-classy restaurant like this with dazzling lights and bars were insulting to these people who struggle to get two meals a day on in their real life.

We were quoted about 40 minutes but were seated in about 20 minutes due to a prior cancellation.\n\nWe were given the complimentary pappad which was really good but I noticed our server didn't give us the sauce that goes with it. Any how, we ordered right away. Everyone ordered a different type of dosa; I ordered the classic Masala Dosa with my potatoes on the side. I was disappointed when they brought my dosa to me. I'm used to having my dosa be larger than the size of my plate; also similar to the dosas they show over their yelp page. My dosa, on the other hand, fit inside the plate. It was too small; especially for the large amount of potato they give you. \n\nI tried the mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam; basically a pancake with mushrooms on it. I LOVED it!\n\nI also tried the Channa Bhatura. This meal was too fusion for my liking. The bhatura, the bread, was fine. The channa, the chick peas, came with very little sauce and had salad all on top (I guess that's the fusion part) but there was nothing special about it. \n\nWe had the \"house-made seasonal\" gelato for dessert; aka mango ice cream. I felt deceived. I was expecting a creamy delicious mango gelato.... instead, we got a Kern's mango juice tasting mess. It was overly sweet and didn't taste fresh at all. It tasted artificial all throughout. I definitely do NOT recommend this to anyone. \n\nService was on the slower side. When it was time to pay, a different server brought over 3 different checks letting us know they split the checks for us; which we did not ask for. When we looked over the checks, they were all different checks from different tables. Pathetic. \n\nAside from the check mix up, I do recommend checking out DOSA at least once.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "A fancy $$$ Indian place in Japantown? Given SF's trends of overpriced food, I was a skeptic but got lured by Restaurant Week, when I found Dosa to be the only place with a worthwhile menu. While most other restaurants feature the anti-climatic addition of a salad and a brownie for a 3-course meal, Dosa became an adventurous feast through spices and creative cooking.\n\n[SMALL PLATES]\n(++) Chips - You start off with complimentary chips, and it's unlike anything I've ever eaten before. It's light, crispy, and has a handful of seeds thrown in.\n(++) Chennai chicken - The expertly roasted chicken maintains a savory juiciness while imparting strong smokey tones, contrasting boldly with the cool cucumber and yogurt sauce. \n(++) Sprouted mung & paneer salad - The varied landscape of flavors was noteworthy, but the texture was truly outstanding. This dish deserves some mindful eating to fully appreciate how the chewy coconut, crunchy pomegranate, and springy arugula simultaneously influence the sprouted mung bean, which ends up tasting more crispy or soft depending on what ends up in that particular forkful. The paneer is interestingly akin to tofu, and I enjoyed the pure taste in contrast to the more pungent versions I usually see.\n(++) Beet croquettes - The sophisticated take pulls off a vegetable-based, cream-free, extra creamy croquettes. Not only does the blend of several vegetables create a palatable base; the incorporation of spices, nuts, curry, and a cranberry chutney adds extra layers of complexity.\n\n[CURRIES ETC.]\n(+++) Nagai vegetable korma - I chose this somewhat as a chore so we could eat our veggies, knowing that vegetable dishes typically pales next to meat dishes (even at State Bird!) But we (even the boo who is usually carnivorous) were blown away. The perfect spice blends of age-old South Indian cuisine combined with novelty vegetables like marble potatoes and romanesco creates a dish that looks modest but synergistically showcases the magic of fresh produce and ethnic cooking. How Californian :)\n(+) Goan prawn masala - I was unimpressed by the portion size of one shrimp per person, and that these were standard-sized shrimp and not prawns. The marsala is constructed from distinctly fresh ingredients, but was dominated by the fiery spiciness.\n(+++) Roasted masala lamb shank - In an era when fine dining consists of abstractly small portions, this ginormous leg of a lamb was a surprise and well worth the extra charge. The 5-hour slow braising resulted in fall-off-the-bone tender and had a similar pervasively roasty flavors to the chennai chicken (excellent savory dish in itself, but exacerbates the spiciness of the prawn masala). The mix of spices with the vegetable-based seasoning added subtlety, and the lamb paired well with the fragrant lemon herb rice.\n\n[DESSERT]\n(+/-) Sweet cheese patties - Not sure if my expectations had just built up too high over the meal or if the dessert is too advanced for me, but despite the intrigue of rose water I think this was my least favorite. The cheese itself had a limp texture and tasted in between savory cheese and dessert, and the conglomerate of cream/nut/cardamom/floral added to the confusion for me. \n(+) Pistachio barfi - As a whole it tasted like an artisan dark chocolate; however it was too sugary, which overshadowed any fascinations from cashew milk and hibiscus. \n\n[DRANKS]\n(++) Mango lassi ($5) - Good mango flavor, easy to drink and not too thick.\n\nWith the tagline \"Urban South Indian dining with a Californian sensibility\", Dosa exemplifies the unique (and delicious) global-local theme that takes the fusion concept to the next level. \n\nPresentation is on-point Instagram-worthy for the most part--from the giant fluffy channa bhatura bread that always catches your eye as it passes by your table, to the fine dining-esque display of beet croquettes on a wooden board with a magenta smear. I actually like how there's also a mix of more plain presentation, such as the vegetable korma in the traditional Indian bowl, which tones down any pretentiousness.\n\nAmbiance is swanky, with extremely dim lighting (if good food pictures are a priority, I strongly recommend coming for a sunny brunch instead). The tall ceilings with a half second level and bar along one side reminds me of NoPa.\n\nAlthough service was friendly, I must say my main gripe overall was the slowness (We arrived at 5:45 and left at 8:45 o.O) (Which meant extra $$ needed for parking; they only validate $2) Ironically, the server checked in with us several times to ask if our round of apps/entrees had arrived, and our answer was that none or only one had come. She also took forever on the mango lassi when boo was breathing fire from the spiciness.\n\nPro tip: Although the menu is extensively notated with dairy/egg/gluten/nut free/vegan, it lacks spiciness warnings. If you can't handle spicy, I suggest avoiding anything that says \"curry leaves\" and/or prophylactically getting yourself a glass of mango lassi.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-01-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Channa bhatura, over fried, request for replacement.

If you are not sure what to order, I recommend the Masala Dosa, Channa Bhatura, some Uttapam (get the Uttapam variety plate if you're not sure which you want to try!), and Dahi Vada.

Also,  I would assume the Bhatura would have been started at the correct time in the afternoon to be ready for their first guests and that they would be able to prepare lamb for the guests who ordered it for their meal.

My dining partner and I had been to the Dosa on Valencia a couple of times a few years ago when it first opened.  We both love Indian food, and it was our first experience eating dosas and uttapams.  We were a little underwhelmed with the blandness of these (starch filled with more starch) and, given the difficulty of getting a table there, didn't go out of our way to return.\n\nHowever, a friend told us to try Dosa on Fillmore, adding that he thought the dishes other than the dosas were superior.  We couldn't agree more.  We were surprised with dishes with complexity of flavor.  The restaurant itself, while a bit of a hipster haven, is quite spacious and the mid-century design is well done.  Also, the menu is different than the restaurant on Valencia.  Now to the food.\n\nMy partner had the tasting menu:\nChennai chicken, which we joked is the Indian version of buffalo wings.  Savory fried bits of chicken with a delightful spicy crust.\nSunchoke uttapam:  A nicely presented pancake, but the bell peppers overwhelmed the rest of the more subtle flavors.\nLamb kofta:  Fabulous meatballs in a tasty, tomato-y sauce.\n\nI had the Channa bhatura, a chickpea curry with a super delicious, puffy piece of bread that is as big as a soccer ball until you puncture it with your fork.  This was a subtle and slightly sweet dish that went very well with the bread.\n\nBecause we enjoyed our entrees so much, we decided to share dessert, and we were not disappointed with a sublime fig, honey and cardamom gelato.  We had the chickory coffee which we were surprised wasn't more like a chai (with the nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, etc.), but if you've had chickory coffee in New Orleans, this coffee will be familiar and have you craving beignets.\n\nOne thing that surprised us was that the dishes weren't spicier.  We really enjoy hot food, but none of our selections was very spicy.  Not a complaint--the flavors were complex and carefully combined--but I had read on Yelp that the food set off some people's spice meters.\n\nService was exceptional and the pricing (except for the pre-dinner whiskey, which was exorbitant) was more than fair.

It's a surprisingly light dessert even though it's creamy and has the texture of panna cotta but is made of CHEESE! The rosewater fragrance is really nice and the pistachios add a great texture.

The food was superb...  I did the special Valentine's Day four-couse tasting and my date ordered off normal menu.\n\nFor starters, I got the Butternut Squash Soup and my date got the Dahi Vada.  The Butternut Squash Soup was roasted and pur\u00e9ed w/brown sugar, cumin, and served with a cilantro coulis.  It was fantastic but almost a little too spicy -- the squash kind of got lost in the heat.  The Dahi Vada was amazing: lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind & mint, mildly spiced.  It was an incredibly well-balanced, beautifully-presented dish, and I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nFor our second course, we shared the Paneer & Peas, which consisted of a Dosa (a savory rice-lentil crepe) filled with spiced, grilled farmer's cheese, peas & cilantro.  This course was okay but nothing to write home about.  The best part of the dish were the three sauces they gave you to dip the Dosa into, but I could have passed on it.... minus 1 star for a not-so-fantastic dish.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Eggplant Kofta and Kate got the Channa Bhatura. The Eggplant Kofta was spiced and cooked to perfection -- one of the best meals I've had in SF.  It consisted of eggplant and potatoes shaped into delicate 'meatless' balls, in a rich eggplant sauce, and served with lemon rice.  The 'meatless' eggplant/potato balls literally melted in your mouth, and the rich eggplant sauce surrounding them was blissfully delicious.  Two thumbs up.  The Channa Bhatura was also good -- a chickpea masala served with an oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread -- but the Eggplant Kafta was definitely our favorite of the two.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Passion Fruit Custard with Coconut Tapioca... but to be honest, we were so full from our meal that we got it to go :)   Oh, and I almost forgot... If you're looking for something to wash the food down with, I recommend Maharaja --- an Indian Pilsner, light style with hoppy & oaky flavors from Navi Mumbai, India.  Most light beers are also a bit too light on flavor for my liking, but this one managed to be light, refreshing, really flavorful, and a good way to balance the spicy dishes.  \n\nAll in all we had a great experience at this place.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We decided to try: Dahi Vada, Channa Bhatura, Raita, and Marsala DOSA.

Dark, romantic lighting, a towering chandelier, leather chairs - it totally sets the mood. Premium cocktails for $5 - I recommend the \"Mood Indigo\" which is a citrus-y type drink. The drinks are very strong - I threw that baby back and relaxed immediately. Silly giggling ensued.\n\nChennai Chicken is excellent - think Tandoori Chicken without the bone and a side of yogurt sauce. Even the slaw salad that accompanied it was good - there's a bevy of Indian spices mixed in - dare I say cumin and curry powder? Whatever it was, I will be ordering that again.\n\nMung Salad - it's mung beans (or lentils) sitting on top of a mixed baby greens salad. It was good, but unsatisfying. Not good for guys. :)\n\nCochin Calamari - delicious if you like spicy, curry / cumin spiced braised calamari. Soft and tender, moist and not at all chewy. Delicious, but if you have to choose between calamari and chicken, get the chicken.\n\nNow on to dinner - \n\nWe got the Channa Bhatura and the Masala Dosa. We would have ordered more, but we got carried away with the cocktails. The Channa Bhatura was GOOD. It's a soft flatbread served with a side of chickpeas in a tomato-y, curry-like sauce. Excellent!\n\nThe Masala Dosa was a dosa (ultra-thin pancake) filled with a potato/lentil filling with a side of 3 sauces. Very good as well.\n\nDosa's strength is their ability to get the flavor of the sauces and curry spot on. Just the right amount of spice, saltiness and sweetness rounding out each tastebud, hitting all the right notes.

After we got back from rock climbing we decided we wanted to go out to dinner, so automatically I started sifting through my yelp bookmarks to see what fit the bill. We decided on Dosa, and were originally going to try out the location on Valencia, but due to some last minute hookah plans, chose the Fillmore location for convenience. I went to opentable.com at 8PM and made reservations for 9:45 and sat around and waited patiently at home nursing my sore muscles. \n\nWe arrived right on time by sheer luck, and were seated right away despite the place being packed. First impressions were that of excitement, after briefly skimming their menu online and reading some other yelp reviews I could seriously not wait to get my grub on. We ordered the Dahi Vada and a Paneer and Peas Dosa as our appetizers and the Tamil Vegetable Curry and Channa Bhatura as our entrees. I choose to go with the wine pairing with the Curry which was a Malbec and fit complimented my food wonderfully. \n\nAs we waited for our food we laughed a little at the decor, most of which is nice but some seemed a little kitsch-y. Overall the impression was that they hadn't quite decided upon a decor they liked yet. We also spied on those around us' food. When a giant plain dosa came out we were all but ready to steal it before our own food showed up. Our appetizers were delicious, the Dahi Vada tasted exactly like some other food we eat, but neither of up could place the taste. Our entrees then arrived in  a very timely matter ( you definitely wont waste too much time here waiting around for food) and we were excited as ever to dig in.... except that both of us were already pretty full. \n\nI ordered the Coconut Rice with my curry which complemented the spices in ways I did not know were possible. I managed to eat half of mine before realizing that it was unwise to try to eat anymore. Thinking that if I got up and used the restroom I would have more room to eat, I discovered the really fucking awesome hand dryers in the bathroom. Now I normally the hand dryers, you stand there forever and your hands just never get dry. But this was a jet dryer and your hands were dry withing seconds.... very cool. \n\nWe ended up getting a doggie bag for the rest of your food, which will make a wonderful lunch for tomorrow.

We also had their cod and eggplant small plates, and the pieces are small, but tasty.  I like that this place can fry food and not have it come out oily.  Nice!  All the dipping sauces are made fresh and are only \"good for 30 minutes\" we were told.  So we dipped quickly.  Now I understand why the host took so long to gloat about the sauces...each sauce had it's distinct flavor and bite and was sooo refreshing, it that's possible.\n\nThe huge chandeliers and massive art hanging overhead made this dining experience an elegant one.  The staff is helpful and friendly and more than happy to take the time to engage in conversation.  The food is spectacular...every bite is filled with aromatic spices.  The microgreens gave the dishes nice kick.

"], "author": "Abhishek C.", "review": "Visited the DOSA with family as it came with a glowing recommendation and a 4* rating on Yelp. But boy, were we in for a rude shock!\n\nLanding at the place with a prior reservation, we were welcomed by a big heavy door and a sizeable eating joint designed at two levels.  Little did I realise that it was the only big thing that we were gonna be experiencing in the restaurant that night (besides the final cheque of course which was already expected)\n\nWe immediately realised after talking to the hostess that they had forgotten to reserve a table for us (Yelp??). They tried to turn it around with a tiny corner table on the upper level which could have seated 5 kids maybe! After a few minutes of contemplation, maybe the staff realised we were definitely not gonna sit in each other's laps and the guests on the adjacent table sportingly moved to make more space for us.\n\nThe real horror started then with our server for the day, Brittany C. Now when a restaurant decides to charge you a 20% service markup automatically just because you are group of 5 or more, the least that you expect is a decent service! But Brittany came in with a tiny heart and grumpy attitude and seemed more in a mood as if we were there to eat for free!\n\nAfter a very offending introduction to a \"$60 set menu or the preferable ala carte menu\", we placed our orders without any recommendations being offered by her despite telling that it was our first visit. We ordered the rava dosa, egg dosa, chile uttapam and goat biryani along with a rasam \n\nThe complimentary pappadums never came out even though the meal came pretty quickly. We had to explicitly ask for them before they turned up. Now the dosa and uttapam were served with a moderate sized bowl of Sambhar and tiny portions of chutneys. Anyway knowing anything about south indian food may please enlighten me how to eat a dosa with a few spoons of Sambhar and a teas0oonful of chutney??\n\nThe food was served very rudely and when we asked if we could get more chutney, we got a condescending answer of \"it will cost you $2\". When we have our consent another server brought it out and it was shockingly just another teaspoonful! We asked the new server if this is what we get in $2, he got confused and said he will be right back after checking but it never happened!\n\nNow in this entire episode the food isn't anything great to write about. It isn't bad but it is definitely not worth a 4* for someone who knows how south indian tastes like. The goat biryani is definitely not a recommendation at all!!\n\nComing back to the service, we never got any water refills and noone checked on how we were liking the food. At the end of it we left most of the goat biryani but Brittany just brought out the cheque and didn't even care to ask why the biryani was left over. For the biryani we asked for a take away box (thought we could give it to someone needy) but Brittany just brought the box and placed it rudely in front of us without a word or smile\n\nAfter all this, we decided that the service did not deserve a 20% charge and we called in the manager who came in with a fake smile and concern. The manager heard our entire ordeal and said she will fix the bill and offered free desserts. We told her very clearly we didn't want free stuff but also didn't want to pay for a service we didn't get and just wanted the charge removed. But she insisted that as it was mother's day she would want us to have desserts so we agreed. And then she crumpled the old bill right in front of us, don't know if that was really required to be done!\n\nIn comes Brittany with the dessert (oh the horror!!). She placed one dessert in front of us rudely (she could have dropped it on our head if she could have had her way) and made a statement \"you talked to my manager, your bill will come in soon\" and just walked away. And then she comes back with another one and leaves with a statement \"hope the free desserts make up for your concerns\". Hello?? Why the hell do people think that customers complain to get free stuff?? Oh and she did come in again to offer chai or coffee which she said was on her. Well dear Brittany, after the experience I would not even had Water if \"it was on you\"\n\nComing from India, I always thought America offers a different standard of service to customers. But dear DOSA management, believe me I realise now that tiny hearts and money minded businesses are incapable of offering anything more than a product. Please keep your free stuff to yourself, if you can offer anything do offer some warmth in your cold little place!\n\nTo Mr Anjan - Thanks for your revert but it just reaffirms your attitude towards the whole incident!

Usually Indian food is already a hit or miss for me when it comes to the post-meal feels since the food is generally heavily spiced/buttered/creamed and my body can't handle the contrast to my normal diet, but I thought that a $$$ Indian restaurant wouldn't do me like that since one would assume that paying a premium for Indian food, WHICH EPITOMIZES CHEAP EATS, would be worth it. Going to Dosa should be like going to a fancy Mexican restaurant instead of Taco Bell because you're not ready to commit to a morning after spent in the loo (ok a bit of an exaggeration but you get the point).

Go for the dosas, maybe the appetizers, and skip the entrees. Definitely more on the fancy/trendy end of Indian food so expect to pay more than the classic Indian joint\n\nCame with a group of 5 for SF Restaurant Week on a Saturday night. Not sure if it was because of SFRW or if it's always like this, but this place was really busy. I could only get a reservation at 5:45pm or at like 9pm a few days in advance. We ended up coming at 5:45 and by the time we left around 7:30, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated.\n\nAmbiance here is very lively and energetic. There's a huge bar and some communal tables on the first floor and tables on two floors. Tall ceilings, dim lighting and chic decor scream nice and trendy.\n\nWe decided to order 2 sets of the 3-course SFRW menu, 1 appetizer and 2 dosas to split between everyone for a total of 3 appetizers, 4 dosas and 2 other entrees, which was plenty to share. The menu can be a little overwhelming if you're not familiar with Southeast Indian cuisine. They're known for their dosas, which are large, crispy Indian crepes generally filled with potatoes and/or other fillings, all of which are served with coconut and tomato chutneys and a vegetable and lentil dipping soup. If you can't decide what to get, you can always opt for their seasonal prix-fixe tasting menu to help narrow down your options!\n\nSome of the portion sizes were pretty small, especially the appetizers, so they were a little hard for sharing. The dosas were very large and filling though, especially the masala (potato-filled) ones. I'd recommend skipping the other entrees though. They were still good, but they were much more expensive than the dosas and rather small in portion size.\n\nOverall, everything was pretty tasty. Lots of flavor and all the meat dishes were cooked very well, but most of the dishes didn't leave a lasting impression. Standouts of the night were definitely the Green Mango & Paneer Dosa (from the SFRW menu) and the White Truffle Masala Dosa. Definitely would want to return to try some more of their dosas.\n\n** APPETIZERS **\n\n-SHREDDED DUCK ($14) - 4/5\n[spicy vindaloo-style, chiles, ginger, garlic, vinegar, caramelized onion uttapam]\nTender, spicy, flavorful.\n\n-COCHIN CALAMARI ($12) - 4/5\n[sauteed with mildly-spiced coconut milk]\nSuper tender, lightly sweet, full of flavor\n\n-SOUTH INDIAN SEAFOOD CIOPPINO ($17) - 4.5/5\n[coconut stew, shrimp, mussels, calamari, scallops]\nDelicious! Light, fragrant, coconutty broth with a slight kick.\n\n** DOSAS **\n\n-GREEN MANGO & PANEER DOSA - 5/5\n[spicy, pickled mango relish, shredded farmer's cheese, cilantro]\nMMM absolutely amazing. I don't know where the mango was in this, but it was lightly sweet and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. If you're not a fan of potatoes, this is definitely a good dosa alternative. Not quite as heavy as the masala dosas either.\n\n-WHITE TRUFFLE MASALA DOSA ($15) - 5/5\n[classic masala dosa, truffle oil]\nI love truffle oil so I loved this! But only the parts of the dosa that actually had the truffle oil.. The truffle wasn't very consistent in the dosa so a lot of it was just a normal masala dosa. But the truffled parts were delicious!\n\n-LAMB KEEMA DOSA ($15) - 4/5\n[plain dosa, side of minced lamb & diced potatoes]\nThe lamb was yummy, but as a dosa as a whole, it wasn't quite as special as some of the others. Worth a try, but if you're a more adventurous eater, it might be a little disappointing.\n\n-SPICY BASIL DOSA ($13) - 2/5\n[masala dosa, fresh basil chutney, cashew nuts, shallots, ginger, curry leaves, chiles]\nMeh. Tasted like a regular masala dosa to me. I don't think anyone in my group got any of the spicy basil part of it. No idea where that basil chutney was.. I'd pass on this in the future.\n\n** ENTREES **\n\n-HYDERABADI LAMB BIRYANI ($31) - 4/5\n[basmati rice, spiced sauce, raita]\nThe lamb was soft and tender, and the rice was nice and fluffy. Delicious overall, but for $31, I was definitely expecting a bigger portion size. At least more rice if not more lamb.\n\n-KERALA FISH MOILEE ($32) - 4/5\n[coconut milk, curry leaves, ginger, coconut rice]\nWow, that fish was cooked soo well. So soft and moist. The curry part honestly was just okay, but the fish was definitely the star here.

I knew I wanted to go to at least 4 restaurants this time, and the $85 put me off.  Well, I looked at the menu at Dosa on Fillmore.  My roommate and I looked at each other and then it became the \"I'll go if you go\" situation.  So we went!\n\nWe started with a sparkling wine to go with our appetizer.  I ordered the petrale sole porichadu.  The sole was fried to perfection and went well with the winter chutney, which I think was made from squash.  The side salad had hints of coconut and other spices.  It was a great way to start the dinner.\n\nFor the second course, I ordered the khageena dosa, which had scrambled eggs, ginger, ghee, and cilantro.  The dosa came with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and lentil soup.  I really liked the lentil soup.  It was fragrant and spicy, and went well with the sweetness of the carrots and red bell peppers.  I wasn't a fan of the tomato chutney.  I preferred the coconut chutney with this dosa.  Which, by the way, was delicious.  Despite all the ingredients, like ginger and cilantro, it didn't overwhelm the flavor of the egg.  It was overall a balanced dish.  The wine that was paired with this was a chardonnay that was very fruit-driven and not buttery.  My roommate's white wine that went with her Winter Uttapam had no flavor.  I thought she was crazy at first, but I tried it.  And it really did have no flavor.  It was the weirdest tasting wine I've ever had.\n\nI got the paneer and almond kofta for the third course.  The dish consisted of two veggie meatballs made up of parsnip, butternut squash, and potato buried in a curry sauce with coconut rice on the side.  The meatballs were drowning in the curry sauce.  I think it would've been better if it was just poured on top.  It seemed like a lot was wasted when I was finished.  The coconut rice was aromatic and softened the spiciness of the curry.  A red wine was paired with this dish.\n\nAnd for dessert, I ordered the banana almond date cake, that was paired with a sherry dessert wine.  It was okay.  The cake itself didn't have a lot of flavor.  It relied on the banana and the spiced cashews for it.  But I think it was that way because it was paired with the sherry, which was very sweet and strong.  I actually preferred the kumquat fruit tart that my friend ordered.\n\nOh, and the waiter was very nice on giving us extra papadums.  They were delicious!!\n\nWould I go back and pay full price?  Yes, but only for special occasions for dinner, or lunch.  The d\u00e9cor merits a fancier dress code, and the dinner prices reflect that.

I've eating my fair share of South Indian cuisines in San Jose and Brick Lane London so I can say I'm somewhat familiar with the spices and tastes of said cuisines.  Now, most South indian dishes are vegetarian and full of carbs so prepare yourself before you eat.  For example, masala dosa is one of the popular dishes which consists of a somewhat paper thin crepe rolled up with lentils inside the middle.  The lentils would qualify as protein since it has some amounts of it.  Samosas are basically smaller rolled up dosas with a lot of filling inside.  Well, I would describe them as hot pockets.\n\nBesides dosas, there's uttapam which is basically the same batter as the dosas but in pancake form.  I ordered the mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam and the South Indian moons where the chef chooses five mini ones to make.  I was a little disappointed where one of the five was the mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam.  Either the chef should have changed it up or the waitress should have warned me before I ordered it.\n\nIf you're looking for non-vegetarian and possibly less carbs, try the Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani.  It can best be described as chicken fried rice but with a lot more spices.  I thought the chicken was pretty good where it was moist and the spices drew out the flavor in the chicken.  Have a sweet mango lassi to wash it down.  Lassi are basically yogurt drinks and they come in Mango, Sweet, or Salty.  Stick with mango unless you really like yogurt but in a drinkable form.\n\n- South Indian Moons (5 uttapams chef's selection)\n- Masala Dosa\n- Veggie Samosas\n- Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani\n- Mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam\n- Sweet Mango Lassi", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-07-16"}, {"excerpts": ["The mushroom & truffle uttapam was outta this world.

After some Yelp sleuthing, we came upon Dosa on Fillmore. \n\nSomething that we haven't tried before? Yep!\nSomething that isn't Japanese food? Yep!\nWe didn't require transit to get there? Yep!\nThe meal wouldn't break the bank? Yep!\n\nSo with that information in tow, we walked 5 minutes from our hotel to Dosa on Fillmore. To our surprise, the restaurant was quite upscale, but still retained a casual feel. We were greeted by the friendly hostess, who quickly led us to our table (booked on OpenTable). \n\nOf course, we couldn't go to an establishment named after a food and not try said food item. So along with a Masala Dosa, my fiancee ordered a Paneer & Cheese Uttapam and an order of the Chennai Chicken to start. \n\nFirst came some homemade lentil chips. It was a bit oily, but burst with flavour (surprising, since the chip itself is very plain from what I assumed was ground lentils). I could only have a single chip, but oil aside the flavour was great. \n\nSoon after, we received the Chenna Chicken, which was served in a bowl on top of a bed of red onions along with a savoury yogurt-based dipping sauce. This was my favorite part of the meal. The chicken pieces were breast meat, but still remained juicy. The seasoning had a substantial spicy kick to it, but when paired with the yogurt dip the flavours all came together and only really nice touch of heat remained at the end of the bite. \n\nNext came the dosa, which comes with 3 dipping sauces: a spicy lentil soup, and a pair of tomato  and coconut chutneys. The lentil soup by itself explodes with flavour. The chutneys were both very delicious as well. As for the dosa itself- the dosa is basically a large, thin crepe folded in half with the filling inside. The crepe had a wonderful sweetness to it that mixed very well with the dipping sauce flavours. The filling (in this case potatoes, onions and cashews) was also very good, but was a touch heavy (since it's almost all starch). That said, all the flavours came together really well, and no one ingredient overpowered any of the others. The variety in dipping sauce flavours kept each bite different from the next, so overall it was a very engaging meal. I honestly thought we didn't order enough and insisted we order something else (the uttapam), but after the dosa and chicken starter my fiancee and I were stuffed. However, the uttapam came to the table so we couldn't ignore it. \n\nThe uttapam is basically a pancake with various ingredients embedded in it, and sliced like a pizza for your enjoyment. The same dipping sauces that accompany the dosa are present, providing the same flavour variety you get with the dosa. From what we could finish, the uttapam was delicious as well. The paneer (cheese) was mild, and added a nice creaminess to the dish which otherwise would've been a touch on the dry side. \n\nI was really glad my fiancee decided to try this place. While she doesn't share the same enthusiasm as I do with the meal, it opened my eyes to another delicious aspect of Indian cuisine that I never knew existed.

If you're reading this on a phone and don't want to read my novel length review, here's the short version: Delicious! Go here!\n\nAfter all the hype, I knew I would have to try one of the fabulous Indian places in SF--and as it happened, one of Dosa's locations is right down the street from the Hotel Kabuki, where I was staying. It also happened to be right across from the theater I had been planning to see a movie at later that night. Dosa and then the Hunger Games--it seemed as if it was meant to be!\n\nThe building took me by surprise--I was expecting classy, but not this much grandeur! Our waiters were helpful, though somewhat socially awkward--not really picking up on our cues and there were definitely some awkward silences that were a little weird. Overall they were helpful and good natured, however, and were happy to explain everything to us.\n\nI am half Bengali and have been to India several times, but I have only been fortunate enough to make it south once. I also lived in Los Angeles for a long period of time, and frequented Artesia, so I'd like to think that I know my way around south Indian food pretty well.\n\nI was intrigued by some of the cocktails, but the waiter sold me on the Ginger Ante, which was quite good--had the warmth and the bite of ginger, rather than just the taste.  My boyfriend and I decided to make the most of our experience and try a little bit of everything. We ordered the South Indian Moons (5 uttapam sampler) and a tasting menu with the things we had read the most raves about: Chennai chicken, the white truffle masala dosa, and the mango prawns.\n\nIn all of my experience, South Indian food is sort of like an inferno of deliciousness in the mouth. This definitely seemed like the white people version, with the spice toned waaay down. The dosa itself was sour, but not quite at the level you usually get. That does not mean that it wasn't delicious, though! I was having a love affair with that potato filling, like that annoying pop song by September. \"No I can't get over, and I don't know why...\" Seriously tasty. The sambar was right on par and the chutneys were delicious as well - the coconut lime one went exceptionally well with the delicateness of this one, I think.\n\nThe Chennai chicken was pretty good, but again, I was wanting more spice! I used to get samosas every day when I was in Calcutta and their Northern interpretation was good--they came to our table a little less than piping hot, and if they're anything less than piping hot then the breading can seem a little heavy handed. The southern version was fantastic, though--creamy sweet onions and very well spiced.\n\nThe uttapam sampler was one of my favorite things. They brought out sunchoke, paneer, tomato, potato, and green bell pepper (?). The sunchoke was pretty good--the crunch from the sunchokes was a playful element, though at times the pieces would fall out so it seemed it could be a little better married (maybe smaller chunks?). The tomato and potato were my two favorites, with the potato definitely coming out on top - a light, fluffy, slightly sour dream of an uttapam. The paneer I left to my boyfriend because I cannot eat cheese, and he said it was good though it did convey the sometimes spongy quality that paneer can have--nothing wrong with that per se but he is picky about texture. The green bell pepper--question marked because I am not sure if that is exactly what it was--was delicious, whatever it was, crunchy with small enough chunks that it was a seamless part of the uttapam. It had the freshness of green bell pepper without the bitterness, which was really wonderful.\n\nFinally, we were served the mango prawns. The prawns themselves were succulent, the coconut rice fragrant. It took me some time to realize that the chunks were actually mango, though that should have been obvious. If you get this, try to eat them with the prawns--they are quite intense on their own. Overall, no complaints on this one--I was full to bursting and still ate half of it.\n\nOverall, we had a really great experience.

A couple of us were new to the restaurant so someone asked if he could explain the menu (anyone who's been there or has eaten more typical North Indian dishes knows that South Indian food is pretty different). Bored, he simply suggested how many appetizers, main dishes, dosas and uttapams he thought the five of us could eat. We tried again, asking him for recommendations, and without direct eye contact he indifferently named a few. We told him we needed some time, and some of us ordered drinks. \"You?\" he head-nodded me curtly when I hadn't said anything. I told him I was fine. When really I wasn't... in fact this guy's sourpuss attitude was pissing us all off.\n\nConsistent with my first visit, the food was delectable.

The 2nd main was masala...an super-sized pancake folded in half with a filling that tastes like the inside of a samosa.  After the 5 moons, my utappam, and now this huge pancake...I was pretty much carbed-OUT!  Ever bread item seemed to taste the same.  The filling was good but I had had enough of the breads....We were full.\n\nAs you see my ignorance of the cuisine has subverted a probably very fun time.  It's a great looking restaurant.

I would consider this restaurant more of an Indian fusion restaurant than just  an Indian restaurant, but that's not a negative at all. The food is South Indian, so it's not the same kind of food you're going to get in most Indian places which typically serve Northern Indian food.\n\nThe reservation website said that everything was full when we tried to make a reservation several days in advance. When we called to inquire whether we could get in for Saturday they told us the internet system has errors sometimes and that if we got there at 5:15 we would most likely be able to get seated at 5:30, when dinner service starts. We got there around 5 and went to the bar. I ordered a cocktail with rum and ginger. It was delicious and you could hardly taste the liquor, though I definitely could feel the effects. We were seated at 5:30 almost on the nose.\n\nEveryone at the table ordered a variety of dishes. I tried a little of everything. I personally ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Soup (which was everything I had hoped for) and the Masala Dosa. I think the Masala Dosa could have been a touch spicier, but I am saying this as someone who can tolerate a lot of heat with Indian foods. The Masala Dosa is the standard dosa, though they had other varieties to choose from. If you've never had a dosa, you really should. It is a large piece of very flat, crunchy bread that is folded over with a filling in the middle. The filling of the Masala Dosa is potatoes and vegetables with curry spices. You dip the dosa into different dips - at Dosa they provide you with a tomato dip, a mint dip, and a lentil dipping soup.\n\nMy brother and my dad ordered the tasting menu, which is a $35 3-course tasting menu. You get a smaller version of the appetizer, an entree, and a dosa/uttapam (the uttapam is a thicker pancake with different toppings). The duck vindaloo we were told was the spiciest curry in the house. It was definitely not too spicy and was absolutely delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful. It's low-lit, there's a lot of fancy light decorations, and while the music is loud, it's not overpowering. Rather than the standard Indian music you would expect in most Indian restaurants, there was a lot of pop/R&B music playing.

This plate was probably one of my favorites.  This dish was totally different then what I expected.  It was a plate of dough that covered the bottom of the plate with the yogurt on top.  Using a spoon you just scooped out your portion.  I can totally see this dish being served on hot day.  \n\nChennai Chicken:  Another win for their appetizer menu.  Chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  The chicken was also served with a yogurt sauce that you dipped the chicken in.  Loved this dish since the chicken was so deliciously flavored.  With each bite you can taste all the different spices that were used.\n\nDosa Cilantro Mint Masala:  Now this is where Dosa really disappointed me.  The cilantro and mint spread in the dosa was extremely salty.  If it wasn't for the tomato and coconut chutney (a dipping sauce) I probably wouldn't have been able to eat much of my dosa.

My dining partner and I had been to the Dosa on Valencia a couple of times a few years ago when it first opened.  We both love Indian food, and it was our first experience eating dosas and uttapams.  We were a little underwhelmed with the blandness of these (starch filled with more starch) and, given the difficulty of getting a table there, didn't go out of our way to return.\n\nHowever, a friend told us to try Dosa on Fillmore, adding that he thought the dishes other than the dosas were superior.  We couldn't agree more.  We were surprised with dishes with complexity of flavor.  The restaurant itself, while a bit of a hipster haven, is quite spacious and the mid-century design is well done.  Also, the menu is different than the restaurant on Valencia.  Now to the food.\n\nMy partner had the tasting menu:\nChennai chicken, which we joked is the Indian version of buffalo wings.  Savory fried bits of chicken with a delightful spicy crust.\nSunchoke uttapam:  A nicely presented pancake, but the bell peppers overwhelmed the rest of the more subtle flavors.\nLamb kofta:  Fabulous meatballs in a tasty, tomato-y sauce.\n\nI had the Channa bhatura, a chickpea curry with a super delicious, puffy piece of bread that is as big as a soccer ball until you puncture it with your fork.  This was a subtle and slightly sweet dish that went very well with the bread.\n\nBecause we enjoyed our entrees so much, we decided to share dessert, and we were not disappointed with a sublime fig, honey and cardamom gelato.  We had the chickory coffee which we were surprised wasn't more like a chai (with the nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, etc.), but if you've had chickory coffee in New Orleans, this coffee will be familiar and have you craving beignets.\n\nOne thing that surprised us was that the dishes weren't spicier.  We really enjoy hot food, but none of our selections was very spicy.  Not a complaint--the flavors were complex and carefully combined--but I had read on Yelp that the food set off some people's spice meters.\n\nService was exceptional and the pricing (except for the pre-dinner whiskey, which was exorbitant) was more than fair.

I also want service that gives a damn and no, I do not wish to pay $5 for an extra sprinkling of paneer on my Uttapam that we all know was nowhere near worth the $15 I dropped on it (pre-$5 charge for paneer).\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love Dosa Valencia and I love their wine list, innovative and creative cocktail menu, and all-out delicious cuisine. I just can't get down with $17 lamb kofta biryani PLUS $4 for a side of rice. I call shenanigans. The environment is nice, and as Eli B pointed out, it's an SF rarity:  a place where the patrons look like they put in a little effort before leaving the house. The waitstaff are also professional and pulled together, if less than friendly. \n\nThe papadum is to die for and I really can't get enough of those lamb balls. Skip the $8 samosa starter (seriously...$8. Samosa. Enough said) and go straight for the spring Uttapam, the lamb balls, and a salad. $100 and something later, you can take comfort in the cheap and classless Goodwill store or dollar store across the street. I still pick Valencia location, hands down.\n\n**Since Anjan (owner of Dosa?) took the time to email me about my review (ummm...I thought it was overall a pretty nice review of a restaurant whose cuisine I enjoy immensely...), I thought I would take a moment to update. As he pointed out, the food is organic and locally sourced for the most part and their animals die happy, politically correct deaths. Of course I'm happy to pay extra for that and kudos to Dosa for their commitment to the environment. That aside, I prefer the Valencia location. 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for capable service and ambiance that enhances the dining experience, 3 stars for what I happen to think are exorbitant prices. 5 + 4 + 3 = 12. 12/3 = 4.

We started with drinks. I had the Emerald Sound and I have to say I loved it. I don't know what my friends drank, but managed to have every drink on the menu. Some were exquisite, others not so much.

The potatoes were spiced but not spicy, which is my preference.\n\nWe finished with dessert. We all three had the banana cream pie, the chocolate cherry cake with spiced ice cream and the passion fruit tapioca. They were all good, but a little disconnected from the rest of the menu. While the drinks and food had a very distinct flavor, the desserts did not. Our waiter said that originally, they only had a few Indian desserts on the menu, but they didn't do that well and had another pastry chef come up with those. While they were tasty none the less, I think the chocolate cherry cake came the closest to fitting in with the spiced ice cream which did compliment the meal nicely. However, the passion fruit tapioca was light and fluffy and did suit being the finale in a spicy meal.\n\nSo, I highly recommend Dosa.

The design is well suited to a number of activities.  There are booth tables, corner tables with chairs, and an upstairs balcony area, which could be conducive to a small party.  There is also a shared bar table, although I hate eating at shared bar tables, for those unafraid of communal dining.  It may be difficult to get a table here, so there is a bar with unique cocktails to order while you wait.  We were told that our table would be ten minutes, but sat at the bar for over an hour.  \n\nIs the food worth the wait?  Yes, as long as the cocktails are abundant.  They also have a nice beer and wine list that pairs nicely with the spicy food.\n\nThe first time I came here, my friend and I ordered a la carte and I left very satisfied.  For two gals with large appetites, we shared the beet soup, which was a warm beet puree with a lovely pinkish color.  I enjoyed the originality and the light flavor of this dish.  We also shared the Chennai chicken, recommended by our waiter.  It is fried, so if you like deep friend food, try it.  The mango shrimp was sweet and the shrimps were succulent!  I also enjoyed our choice of dosa, which was paneer and spinach.  Most of the dosas also come as an Uttapam option, which is a thicker version of a dosa.  The dosas also come with two dipping sauces and a soup that is very spicy.  They bring a carafe of water which helps with the spice.\n\nOn the second visit, my friend and I tried the tasting menu.  I probably wouldn't do that next time, because it is a bit expensive and the choices are a limited version of the a la carte menu.  As an appetizer, we shared a salad and Cochin calamari.  I like the calamari because it is not deep fried.  I enjoy sauteed Calamari.  We also shared two mini dosas which were delicious.  For our main course, we enjoyed the mango shrimp and the Kerala fish Moile, a light fluffy fish, both refreshing.  For dessert, we shared Gulab Jamoon, fried dough, and Kulfi, and Indian ice cream.  This meal was probably too filling for me.  I definitely recommend ordering single dishes, which seem to be more value for the recession minded.\n\nI will definitely be back here.

(i think it used to be the goodwill which now sits caddy corner?) high ceilings, gorgeous hanging chandeliers, perfectly dimly lit, a paint palette and walls of art that suit the vibe and cuisine...and of course the alluring smell of the food. this location seats 130-some odd guests, between the main floor, balcony and large communal table in the bar area. and of course then there a full bar and the menu has a nice list of some India-inspired cocktails as well as a good wine list.\n\nthe menu appeared basically the same, therefore i had a hard time steering away from my favorite Dosa dishes (like the Cochin calamari). but we did try the paper Masala Dosa as well as the five moons Uttapam which were both AMAZING. i cannot say enough good things...congratulations and THANK YOU Dosa.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-11-29"}, {"excerpts": ["The mung dosa was good but it was all about the uttapam!

There is definitely plenty of eye contact and eyelash batting at this communal table. * wink * wink * If you are a people-watcher and conversation-listener like me, topics around this narrow stretch of wood can be quite...interesting, to say the least. For example we were debating the merits and credibility of YELP *ahem* and the waitstaff happened to pass by and over hear with a smirk on her face. I cringed hoping that the rest of the evening would not involve a swift kick to the butt and boot out of there.

The Chennai Chicken ($9.50) came out next, organic chicken marinated in organic yogurt with coriander and cumin, then fried.   It packs a perfect amount of heat from all the spices.  It came with a slaw of cabbage, carrot, beet, red onion and spinach lightly dressed with a sweet cilantro vinaigrette.

Great, bold, flavor, with a bit of kick to top things off.\n\n* Samosas \"North & South\" ($9) - More or less your standard samosas, the South was filled with caramelized onions and veggies, while the North was simply filled with spiced potatoes.

However, when had with the sauces, both were quite tasty.\n\nWhile I ordered the following for myself:\n\n* Okra Kolambu ($13) [ http://flic.kr/p/dp67ut ] - While I find the texture of okra to be a bit weird (admit it, okra is a tad slimy), this was actually a very tasty dish, mixing up savory and sweet flavors with a hint of spice. While most will probably find this to be a single serving, I easily had enough leftovers for seconds.\n\n* Rum with South Indian Monsoon ($6 + ?) - Normally a virgin drink, the ingredients (citrus, mint, ginger, juice, and soda) screamed out for a splash of rum. Two others in the group agreed, and not one of us was disappointed by the delicious cocktail that arrived moments later.\n\nWith enjoyable food and great service, Dosa is definitely on my to-revisit list.

This makes total sense if you are going to Dosa for crazy south Indian food. Wow this place is satisfying. Like ridiculously satisfying. Organic and sustainable foods and an insanely bad ass seasonal tasting menu here, with four people, you can sample the entire thing to you hearts content. But we went \u00e0 la carte and ordered Hyderabadi Shammi Kebabs (Minced lamb, cardamom, peppercorns, ginger, fennel & lentils, pan fried with mint raita), Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani (Bone-in, natural, basmati rice with an aromatic spiced sauce, caramelized onions, cashews, peas), Duck Vindaloo (Spicy, Goan curry, red chiles, malt vinegar, ginger, cumin, mini potatoes, curry leaves (great with coconut rice)), 2 orders of the South Indian Moons (Chef's selection of five different uttapams), a side of Raita, and some green mango Acharr. And then we died. And then the food came. It was delicious. Dunking the uttapams in sambar was the best part; they are a bit thicker ans smaller than dosa and hold the stew well. Super delicious. The biryani was spicy. Very spicy. And very delicious. Bone in chicken kind can be a hassle but it tastes better so it's a worthy trade-off. The mango acharr was nice and tart, I polished it off little by little with each bite of everything. I do wish we would have ordered more lamb kebabs to start, those were really good, and the plates were smaller than expected.\n\nI also got this weird drink called the South Indian Monsoon. Ginger and mint with pomegranate and mango juice + soda and citrus. It killed me.\n\nAmbiance is sick. If you can get a table next to the rail on the second floor do it. It's an amazing view of the busy bar and 1st level. A beautiful chandelier hangs from above. The interior is very warm and they did a good job of using color, it really pairs well with the cuisine. Goes to show how amazing food plus great design can really complete a dining experience. \n\nOverall, I left stuffed to the point of dying. Seriously, I haven't been that full in a really long time. Great experience.\n\nParking can be a bit of a hassle but you'll figure it out. Dosa is also close to Japan Town so that is an added bonus if you're in SF.\n\nalso I want to know who made the rule that we have to capitalize the first letter of every sentence. it's a dumb rule. i'm not doing it anymore.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-04-15"}], "tapioca kheer dessert dinner": [], "rasmalai dinner": [], "almond ambur chicken street wrap lunch": [], "tamil lamb street wrap lunch": [], "paneer street wrap lunch": [], "chutney sampler dinner": [], "honeynut squash chaat dinner": [], "sprouted mung and lentil salad dinner": [], "dahi vada dinner": [], "chennai chicken dinner": [], "lamb kebab dinner": [], "vada pav veg slider dinner": [], "southern samosas dinner": [], "rasam fire broth soup dinner": [], "sambar dinner": [], "winter bhel puri dinner": [], "idli fries dinner": [], "dungeness crab poori dinner": [], "kerala chicken dinner": [], "grilled zuckermans asparagus dinner": [], "brokaw avocado chaat dinner": [], "lake kochi grilled prawns dinner": [], "rasam fire broth brunch": [], "sprouted mung and lentil salad brunch": [], "kerala chicken brunch": [], "spiced avocado chaat brunch": [], "sambar brunch": []}
