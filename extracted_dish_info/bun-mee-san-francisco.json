It made the sandwich much more tastier then it looked. Spice? My palate is sensative to spice and I felt like I only recieved 0.005 spice instead of 5 spice. I had wish my sandwich had more cilantro as it only had 1 stem of cilantro. The french bread was fresh, easy to eat - unlike other places the bread is too toasted (or old) where the texture is hard. I'd definately order this again.\n\nGREEN PAPAYA SALAD ($3.50) - enjoyed the papaya salad. it was very fresh and had that great kick to it that really complimented the sandwich. people may complain the blandness of the sandwich, well next time they should order this salad because its pretty flavorful and will balance the blandness out.\n\nHOUSE-MADE STRAWBERRY LYCHEE AGUA FRESA ($2.50) - oh WOW now that was a refreshing drink. I'd probably have to order 2 of these in my next sitting. I cannot explain how yummy this drink was.\n\nIf I had brought friends who grew up eating authentic Vietnamese food to this establishment, they'd probably punch me in the face.

I live in the neighborhood so now I have to chance to. I went in the other night and was quite pleased with the food, the pricing, and the variety of items... oh, and I personally found the setting (and surrounding area) quite charming! \n\nI ordered the lemongrass pork banh mi, the pork belly bowl with brown rice, sweet potato fries, and the strawberry lychee drink.

How stereotypical of me!) The service was alright. They bring the food out to you and while they don't \"wait\" on you, I'd like a little enthusiasm or at least a smile with the delivery. I'll pass on that side of passive aggressive smile with my Vietnamese sandwich please, thanks! Eh... I'm over it.
