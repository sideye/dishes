They've added all sorts of little deli salads that all look amazing.. one with quinoa and another with edamame!

Keep up the good work Blue Barn!\n____________________________________________________\n\n\n3 1/2 Stars\n\nHoly smokes this place was packed!\nBlue Barn definitely isn't having a hard time bringing in customers despite being their first week open. Pretty impressive.\n\nHowever, you can tell that they don't yet have the manpower to cater to such a big demand. We had to wait quite awhile for our sandwiches while doing the mamba with incoming/outgoing customers in their cramped space.\n\nThe employees there are very amicable, with great attitudes and lots of smiles. The inside actually feels a little barn-like, but not necessarily in a good way. It was dark & drafty, which could be remedied by... turning on the lights! Maybe this is a kink they still need to work out, but I swear I saw lights installed, just not on.\n\nI tried their Hen sandwich which is citrus-herb-roasted chicken, crispy prosciutto, sharp provolone, tomatoes, arugula, avocado, thyme aioli, & honey mustard on sourdough bread.

The pressed sourdough bread was a nice touch though. Oh and they included a piece of old style bubble gum in my friend's sandwich. What a cute idea! But hey! Where was mine?\n\nOverall, the place is a pretty Marina, frou frou kinda place with high end drinks, salads, cheeses, crackers, and sandwiches. Their create-your-own salads sound veeery tempting. You get to select 6 toppings, which includes a variety of gourmet fixings like sun-dried tomatoes, candied pecans, pomegranates, ricotta salata cheese, soba noodles, etc. Even the dressing choices are fancy: chipotle agave, lemongrass nuoc cham, champagne-saffron vinaigrette, roasted red pepper caesar. YUM-O. I'll be swingin' by again to get a fancy pants salad and maybe a side of their tantalizing Rustic Potato Salad. I just hope I don't have to wait too long.\n\nSidenotes:\n\n-This place really isn't designed for you to eat at, seeing as how they have only 2 little tables. It's more of a grab & go kinda place.\n-I like their cute Blue Barn stickers that help lock up the sandwich.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-11-15"}, {"excerpts": ["and she adds carmelized onions and arugula.

It's a pretty salad with plenty of variety; they cut and julienne the carrots, crunchy soba noodles, almonds, scallions and romaine lettuce into small, even pieces and sprinkled sesame seeds on top.  The extra large, meal sized salad was crispy, crunchy and fresh.  It comes with a small piece of foccacia.  I didn't like the sweet and sour vinaigrette dressing though - it was too sweet (tasted like sweet hoisin sauce).  I wanted something more sour, light, and tangy.  The chicken was dry.  I think it would have been better with red onions, cilantro and a different dressing.  \n\nSeating is limited and you may have to share the large communal table.

Blue Barn is actually worthy of the expenditure. The salad portions are large. The ingredients are extremely fresh. I like the idea they are sourced locally.

Fortunately I was attending an event at Fort Mason, so it was the perfect opportunity to rendezvous with Nina Y. and catch up. We were deciding between eating a salad or Italian food. I wanted something more on the refreshing side, so Blue Barn it was.\n\nFrom the moment you walk in, it's clear this is more of a to-go place, though I hear there's another Blue Barn location down the street that's less so. At any rate, I was able to snag some seats at the communal barstools while waiting for Nina. Ordering was pretty quick after that. I got their spicy tuna salad, which was massive! Ingredients include mixed greens, chicory chop, spicy ahi tuna, avocado, mango, snow peas, cucumber, scallions, sesame seeds, soba noodles & miso-ginger vinaigrette. WOW.\n\nThe salad was a bit pricey ($16.75) but you definitely get what you pay for. It's rare I'm unable to finish a salad because of how light it's supposed to be, but the to-go box was dauntingly large. An observation, not a complaint, of course. It also had a good amount of dressing, though I wish I had asked for more.\n\nGood place to stop by if you're looking for a quick bite to eat or need something for the road.

After getting parking easily and buying candy at the Walgreens, the age old of question of what to do about dinner reared its ugly head.\n\nWhen you're going to a movie, the movie takes priority over a decent meal.

The woman at the counter was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the restaurant and food, so much so we took her as the owner or partner. And, it wasn't only us. She and the woman prepping the salads were nice to the stroller mom and dad who followed us. Nothing but friendly. The next day we came and recognized us, again, welcoming us back.\n\nThe first night I had the Beets & Greens salad.

Blue Barn is actually worthy of the expenditure. The salad portions are large. The ingredients are extremely fresh. I like the idea they are sourced locally. It's still a better deal than many places in terms of the cost-value price relationship.\n\nSpecial notes: you will run into Marina people here. If you like them, great. They are everywhere.

The steak was great and I got it medium rare. Mental note: get the dressing on the side next time.

We had to wait quite awhile for our sandwiches while doing the mamba with incoming/outgoing customers in their cramped space.\n\nThe employees there are very amicable, with great attitudes and lots of smiles.

(*phew* That was a mouthful.) It's a little pricey at $8.50 a pop, but it has \"Gourmet\" in its name, so it's expected. It was savory, but the mustard was a little overpowering. The pressed sourdough bread was a nice touch though. Oh and they included a piece of old style bubble gum in my friend's sandwich. What a cute idea! But hey! Where was mine?\n\nOverall, the place is a pretty Marina, frou frou kinda place with high end drinks, salads, cheeses, crackers, and sandwiches. Their create-your-own salads sound veeery tempting.
