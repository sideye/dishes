They don't slice green and red peppers anymore their perfectly cubed from a can like dennys. The amazing fresh squeezed orange juice they used to have from hasn't been around in a year they used to have small dark orange Cali oranges now they don't even have the machine running. They have it \"already squeezed\" when you come in and it's yellow and watered down very acidic obviously cheap Florida oranges!? The aqua Panna Italian water no more now they have the cheapest plastic bottled water from a local wholesaler. The French toast and pancakes come out without butter and if you ask they brink little individual butter packets that are cold so you can't spread it instead of spreadable butter in a suace container from the kitchen like any good restaurant. The English muffins are burnt on one side and raw on the other have had to send them back multiple times.

I went to the Squat & Gobble after the Men's Health Urbanathlon. My party went up to the counter, placed our order, and went to the patio entrance, where we were told that we would have to wait for a table. Next to the patio entrance, we noticed that there was a huge water station with dozens of glasses of ice water. We also saw that a couple people who were also waiting to be seated had glasses of water. So we assumed that it would be no problem grabbing a glass of water to drink while we waited to be seated. We were wrong. Well, two members of our party of five had good timing and grabbed a glass of water without being detected. But when I went up to the water station and grabbed a glass of water, a busboy grabbed my arm and removed the glass from my hand. I said that we were waiting for a table on the patio and wanted a glass of water while we waited. The busboy said no. Water would be brought to us after we were seated. Undeterred, I removed my arm from his grasp and picked up another glass of water. He grabbed my arm again. I said: \"Really? We can't have a glass of water while we wait to be seated?\" And as I was starting to explain that running 10 miles with obstacles makes a person thirsty and irritable, I found myself surrounded by two busboys and someone who appeared to be the manager, all of whom were telling me to \"put the water down\" like it was a weapon. I believe I said something like: \"All I want is some f*#@ing water while we wait for our table.\" I had other things to say, but the manager-looking man kept interrupting me with: \"Sir, please. Sir. Sir. Sir, please. Sir. Sir. Let go of the water. Sir. Please, sir. Sir, please. Sir. Put the water down. Sir. Thank you. Sir. Sir. Put the water down.\" Meanwhile, the busboy was still holding my arm. At this point, the incident had become so funny that I started laughing, put the water down, and returned to the patio entrance to wait for the table. As promised, water was brought to our table when we sat down. But why not let us have a drink of water during our 20-minute wait? The whole thing seemed ridiculous. \n\nAside from the water incident, the food was good, not extraordinary, but good. My coffee was great, but it took way too long to get a refill.

Maybe it was just my experience I'm not sure, but my cousin and I finally got our food when my sister and her boyfriend were already half way eating there. Usually in this situation, my cousin and I felt as if we had to rush eating our food since my sister and her boyfriend would soon be done eating there's. Another note, we didn't get our food until we had to ask them about it twice. Hence, the drop in 1 star.\n\nSquat & Gobble has a variety of great food -- wonderful place for brunch (crepes, omelettes, eggs, breakfast specials, salads, sandwiches, pasta, and others). You just go up to the cashier and order, they give you a number, and you find seating for yourself and your party (extra seating available in the back patio).\n\nMy cousin and I both ordered the same dish - CHICKEN PESTO CREPE (sliced chicken breast, mozzarella, onions, pesto and sun-dried tomatoes). The crepes are served with choice of rosemary garlic potatoes or mixed baby green salad. We both chose the ROSEMARY GARLIC POTATOES.\n\nThe CHICKEN PESTO CREPE was absolutely amazing. It was gush full of strong flavors (especially from the sun-dried tomatoes, which were a good size and not small). The cheese was fully melted which is a must for me whenever there's cheese and it's a hot dish. The ROSEMARY GARLIC POTATOES were cubed and still had their skin on. They were very crunchy at the edges and soft when bitten into. The spicing was perfect and really helped bring out the potatoes. If you ever were given the choice of having these potatoes or mixed baby green salad, choose the rosemary garlic potatoes. They're more carbs, but you can get mixed baby green salads anywhere. \n\nMy sister and her boyfriend got CRAB CAKE FLORENTINE (Two crab cakes, two poached eggs & saut\u00e9ed spinach on an English muffin topped with hollandaise sauce. Served with potatoes or fresh fruit) and a BREAKFAST BURRITO. I didn't have a taste of them, but I did get pictures (in the Photo section) and the dishes were gorgeously done with a variety of pretty colors and what not. \n\nWouldn't mind coming back and trying something new.

The service was polite and they were accommodating as I remember seeing a tiny server moving a large table from one end of the dining room to the other after accommodating a larger party.

For me, when I have chorizo, I love the oil. The greasy, spicy, garlic that oozes into everything is the reason I love chorizo. I would use it for salad dressing and to make puff pastry for savory treats is I could ever stop sopping it up with warm tortillas and my fingertips. Sadly, for me, the burrito did not have this sexy oil. It was bland and egg heavy. I get it, it's a breakie burrito. Eggs are the main ingredient. But not my taste.\n\nThe veggie bennie (spinach florentine) was fine. For me I liked that they used bloomsdale spinach instead of baby. It has more flavor and the heartier stems give it some character. I know that my chefs all wanted me to pick off the stems since they're \"inedible,\" but screw it. I think they're lovely.

They were very crunchy at the edges and soft when bitten into. The spicing was perfect and really helped bring out the potatoes. If you ever were given the choice of having these potatoes or mixed baby green salad, choose the rosemary garlic potatoes. They're more carbs, but you can get mixed baby green salads anywhere. \n\nMy sister and her boyfriend got CRAB CAKE FLORENTINE (Two crab cakes, two poached eggs & saut\u00e9ed spinach on an English muffin topped with hollandaise sauce.

Anyway, when I was there I tried the \"french toast indulgence\", which LOOKS amazing. I don't remember what exactly is in the filling, but I do remember something about Italian cream or something. Upon tasting it, everything was good EXCEPT the filling. I liked the first bite, but after that it just tasted like molasses, cinnamon, and cream cheese. Ew! All that for around just under $10? No thanks. My friends each got different things; one got pancakes that she was very happy with, and the other got a breakfast burrito that looked amazing! (it's on a special menu board right under what I got, and seems to have pretty much everything in it!) If I get the chance to come back, I would like to try the burrito....without chorizo, of course.\nMy friend who ordered the pancakes also got a Screwdriver (I'd like to mention that they squeeze their orange juice fresh, and everything that contains OJ has fresh-squeezed in it....definitely a plus) but this drink tasted like a floral perfume might taste. I've never had a screwdriver before, so idk if they all taste that way, but it was really nasty.\n\nIf you go, I recommend sitting on the covered (and heated!) patio.

So, I decided on the soup of the day (tomato bread); the half chicken, mashers w/ mushroom wine gravy and the squash; and a glass of sauvignon blanc. The soup was quite tasty and rich. Not real sweet and nice spice to it. However, there were a few stems from the herbs which was odd.\n\nChicken was nicely seasoned, but a little overcooked and the bones broke a bit too easily. Mushroom gravy was nice, 'taters were good, but tasted like they had Gorgonzola in them (not a huge fan of the latter).
