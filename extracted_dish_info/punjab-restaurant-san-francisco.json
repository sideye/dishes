But whatever, on to my initial experience at Punjab.\n\nAs I walked up the corner of 24th and Bryant, I noticed this restaurant and thought, hmmm, Indian food in the Mission, sounds nice, maybe I'll try this.\n\nAs I walked in, I didn't smell the typical curry smell of an Indian food place, in fact, just a clean odor of Fabuloso, which made me think of Mexico, and then noticed the strange Chinese decor everywhere, and a fish-tank without fish inside.  There was a 50's diner feel to the place as well, which, again, threw me, as the restaurant had an Indian name, Chinese dragons and crap all over the walls, and looked like a greasy spoon, but certainly didn't smell like one.  Only in San Francisco, I though to myself.  The whole layout focuses on a kind of darkish-greenish color, like forest green or something.\n\nSo I sat down at the bar/diner area facing the kitchen in a quite comfortable green swivel-chair, at the greenish-colored bar and was greeted by a Chinese/Malaysian lady of indeterminate age, whom I later learned was named Serene, or Serena, something like that. I tried the Punjab soup upon Serene's recommendation. Spicy but not overly so, shrimp won-tons that weren't overly dry or gushy, chunks of kohlrabi or baby bok-choy, in a large bowl, piping hot and utterly delectable.  They had Tsing-Tao beer, and other selections, all very reasonable.  \n\nAs I ate my soup, I recognized that there were a number of American offerings on the menu, so I quizzed the chef and Serene as to the quality of the American food they served there, and they both assured me that it was very good.\n\nSo, I took the 19-Mission from the TL all the way back to this restaurant on Sunday, soon after I'd tried it for the first time, with my girlfriend, for a little adventure, and we had brunch here.\n\nI can't say enough good things about the brunch as well, I order Chicken Fried Steak with eggs over-easy and hash-browns, which also came with two sourdough pancakes, I think the full cost of this giant order was around 11.00 or less.  Unbelievable price, and with a free mimosa as well!  My girlfriend had some huge omellette, which came with some other sides, and again, a free mimosa, for around 8 or 9 dollars, again, out of this world prices.  For only 2 dollars more you could get another mimosa, so we began killing mimosa after mimosa, all the while being attended very attentively by Serene, who's friendly demeanor topped off the experience making it as perfect as it could get.  \n\nUnfortunately it was super-hot that day, we'd intended on doing some shopping in the Mission, but were both too full to shop, so bussed back to the Tender-Nob and enjoyed some of the meds I'd found at the dispensary recently.

A lot of it is just average, (still good, though) but their potstickers can NOT be beat! I'm also a huge fan of their pork buns, and hey, their American food is pretty tasty, too! (Fish n chips especially.) Orange chicken is always a great bet, and for what it's worth, their burgers are nice. (way better than the overpriced crap at St. Francis) Especially since everything is served with a smile and a \"Hi! How are you today?\" If you are a regular, they know your name, even if you don't remember ever telling it to them.\n\nI also love the atmosphere. I have an affection for \"fixtures\"..  i.e. people who are more than just regulars, they seem like they belong there and they simply came with the building. Punjab has that.

I can't imagine that anybody in need of a Chinese food fix would go to this place based on its name and location alone. \n\nSo I'm here to tell you about Punjab's inner beauty and why you should give it a chance as I did when I first moved to the Mission. \n\nThe food is OK. I'll say that off the bat. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. I don't want you to expect earth shattering flavors when you go here. This is not why I like this place. Like I said, the food is decent, but the je ne sais quoi is fantastic. That's right. I haven't quite put my finger on it yet, but I love coming here for reasons unknown. \n\nIs it because it's the only Chinese restaurant I know that serves Pho? Decent Pho at that. Or maybe it's the server (Serene) who makes you feel at home the minute you step foot inside. She'll know your life story by the end of your meal and you'll know hers. Could it be that they have free mimosas on Sunday for brunch? Or perhaps the fact that you could come here for breakfast and order steak and eggs?\n\nWhatever the reason, I'm S-O-L-D and this is why I keep coming back. It's my go-to resto in a pinch. Prices are cheap, food is pretty good and the staff is warm. And it's 2 blocks from my place (I guess I should have mentioned that before). It does help that it is walking distance from my apartment. A definite plus. Especially in the Mission where there is a scarcity of good Chinese restaurants.\n\nJust for the hell of it, here are a few of my go to items:\n\nSalt and Pepper Pork Chop\nSpicy Basil Chicken\nCombo #4\nKing Of Kung Pao\nPunjab Fried Rice\nPunjab Chow Mein\nWonton Soup\n\nWhat I won't be ordering again:\n\nRoasted duck\nBeef with Brocolli (more like Brocolli with some beef)\n\nAnd seriously, try the Pho. It's not the best Pho in the world but it might surprise you.\n\nIf by your first visit you're not enchanted by this unassuming hole-in-the-wall Chinese/American diner hodgepodge of a restaurant, then you need to have your soul checked. \n\n4.1 stars", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-05-21"}], "roast duck": [], "ginger beef with scallion": [], "  family dinner": [], "soda or mineral water": [], "snapple lemon iced tea": [], "apple or orange juice": [], "imported bear": [], "domestic bear": [], "wine by the glass": [], "coffee or hot chocolate": []}
