Furthermore, I don't order raw fish. With my weak stomach it's just not a good idea. I also don't order bento boxes, but that's because I rarely order them anyhow. Same with tempura.\n\nSo I keep it simple. I order some rolls. Recently I ordered these:\n\nPhilly Roll (smoked salmon, no way my stomach will react)\nUme Shiso Maki (pickled plum with shiso leaves)\nKampyo Maki (marinated gourd)\n\nI liked them all. Excect for the extreme carb coma, no complaints here. I paid less than $12 for three rolls (2 were veggie) and I was not hungry for a loooong time after. I've also gotten their futomaki. Same resulting tiredness and satiated belly.\n\nThere's a line during peak lunch hours. If you don't order the specials your food will take time to come out--I assume because their specials are pre-made in large quantities. But for what it is (quick basic Japanese food) you could do worse in the area.

Take out service is slooooooow whether it's during the lunch rush or after 2pm.  I dont git it. \n\nThat being said, I like the sushi.  If you are a vegetarian (I'm not, but I love my veggies), they have a great, varied menu.  The yam tempura roll is pretty damn yummy.  \n\nThey offer lunch special pre-packs that contain the ubiquitous california roll, along with tuna, salmon, ebi, etc., as well as miso soup (VERY bland) and side salad (nice tangy dressing).  The idea is to grab the pre-pack sitting next to the register and go.  But you still have to wait for them to pack the soup and salad, which can take an inordinate amount of time.  Sometimes the raw fish in the pre-pack doesnt taste that fresh, probably because it's been sitting unrefrigerated by the heat generating cash register.  Oh, and if you dont get there by 11.30, the pre-packs already are gone.\n\nSo, I recommend ordering something off the menu.  You'll wait just as long and the meal will be fresher.\n\nIf you decide to visit this restaurant, dont do it when I'm there.
