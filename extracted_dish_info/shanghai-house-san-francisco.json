Though it was slightly bothersome to watch her bring food to people who had entered the restaurant much AFTER me. I waited... Waited...

WHAT?! Again I reported I had ordered for \"HERE\" - and this time she replied with something along the lines of \"I thought you ordered to go\". She did NOT apologize for the misunderstanding. Note - when I'm hungry, I get irritated... Internally, I was so frustrated!

Lets start with the lines and work our way in.. \n\nFirst off, the food is good, overpriced, the service is poop, and the place is small with little walking space. This place is recommended for parties of 2-4, 5 max! If the restaurant is full, the first group will have to stand outside and wait in line. Though, there is no designated area to wait. If you're standing outside with your group, it looks like you're loitering. We came during dinner, just in time to beat the crowd. From what I witnessed by the windows, it was cold out. The second group of people that came in ended up coming into the restaurant to wait in the walkway and it seemed like they were also trying to cut the big group of people outside. \n\nMy party of 5 was seated next to the door. For our table that seats 4, my cousin had to sit on the side where the walkway of the door is. The customers at the restaurant would be rude and pull the door in, hitting him instead of pushing. The restaurant should have a push/pull sign so customers know what to do without hitting others who are dining. When we first came, there were 2 tables often. The one next to the doorway and the table next to that one. We wanted the one inside because we knew someone had to be seated in the walkway, but she put us by the doorway which was very inconvenient. There seemed to only be 1 waitress and she was rude. She would see us waving her down then disappear into the back for a few mins. Come back out and talk to other customers who came in. Took us 5-10 mins to wave her down for the check and we were close to dine and dashing because it took so long. Took her 5 mins to come take our orders as well. \n\n As for the food, it was delicious. My party and I did something similar to family-style, but it was little food for the 5 of us, I think. We ordered the Shanghai Dumplings, fried chicken wings, spicy noodles, and green onion pancakes from what I remember. All were great choices, delicious, but not enough for the party of 5 (but didn't want to order more because overpriced for it's portions). I ended up having to go next door to buy a sandwich. Surprisingly, located next to my favorite smoked salmon sandwich cafe (La Promenade). Popular for the Shanghai dumplings aka Xiao Long bao, I think the quality of it was average. Did not taste any different to other ones I've had. \n\nFor the portion size, I felt that the food was overpriced. Service was crap, but food was good. Not worth it, and wouldn't recommend coming back here unless there is no wait and you want to spend your money on small portion sized food but good.

I even brought my parents here from the South Bay, and the XLB was judged to be so tasty that we added to our order.\n\nBut yesterday... I don't know what happened. First off, zero greeting whatsoever by the only lady holding it down solo. She just tossed the menus on our table. I know it's a Chinese place so had no expectations of superior service, but really? Not even a 'hi'? Dislike. Also, the place was not busy whatsoever. There were 3 tables occupied. Yet she preferred to take hiding behind a huge indoor plant that's been conveniently placed on the cash register counter, thus blocking her from overseeing the dining floor. It was difficult to get her attention when we wanted our check, and I could see behind the plant she was wolfing down a bowl of soup or something.\n\nMoving on..The XLB was the real disappointment, however. They were tiny and flat instead of round and plumpy. It was almost an art to peel off the baos without tearing the bottom off of the steamer that's only been lined with parchment paper. Plus the ones that did succeed in landing in my soup spoon in one piece had such little juice, it almost didn't matter how meticulously you removed the baos.\n\nThe Green Onion Pancakes and the Green Beans with Veggies and Tofu dishes were just average.

When my SIL wanted to meet me for lunch and asked me for suggestions, it gave me an early opportunity to check out the newly opened Shanghai House (Jia JIa Fu) restaurant on Balboa with a couple of representatives from my Shanghai contingent in tow.\n\nThere was no doubt about Shanghai House's truly Shanghainese identity, with the server, the other parties there at early lunchtime, and two-thirds of my own party speaking Shanghainese (and me with my usual Yangjingbang). The menu, too, was rock-ribbed Shanghainese cuisine in its offerings, even if some of the \"rice\" dishes turned out to be somewhat eccentric home-style renditions. Unfortunately, some of the Shanghai \"dim sum\" items are only offered on weekends (which isn't made clear in the menu).\n\nWe ordered xiaolong bao; one cold dish (salted duck); a couple of \"rice\" dishes, Shanghai classic \"meicai kourou\" (steamed pork belly with pickled vegetables) and a tofu and seafood clay pot; and one soup, also a Shanghai classic, fried tofu with bean thread noodles.\n\nI was able to approach the xiaolong bao with freshly calibrated taste receptors, having returned from Shanghai just two days before, and am happy to report that they were very good. Only an artlessness in the wrapping (they looked slightly misshapen) and a slight lack of flavor depth in the broth kept them from being the equal of Shanghai Dumpling King's and Oakland's Shanghai Xiao Chi's versions, but at $4.95 for 10 I'm willing to cut them a little slack. I made do with worse at several venues in Shanghai. They also made me vow to return on the weekend to try some of the other Shanghainese brunch items.\n\nThe other dishes were a mixed bag. The salty duck was tasty and lean, but had the appearance of being either too old or suffering from refrigerator burn, showing some discoloration and dryness. The pork belly/mei cai was marred by a too-sweet red sauce, but otherwise good. The tofu and seafood hot pot had fried tofu instead of the expected fresh tofu, and also suffered from a confusion of too many ingredients in it. It was almost as if all the ingredients one might toss into seafood hot-pot in the course of a leisurely hot pot dinner were crammed into a modest clay pot. This is not to say that there was anything leftover-ish about the contents; most of the ingredients appeared to be fresh and cooked just the right amount. If you are a seafood nut, this is the Chinese Cioppino for you.\n\nThe xifen/you doufu soup was the most peculiar of all. It came with an opaque brown broth, though neither I nor the two Shanghainese have ever seen this soup before with anything but a clear broth. It was savory enough, but a bit jarring visually.\n\nI went return ed the following Saturday for lunch, intending to try some of the Shanghainese brunchie stuff only available on weekends. Nonetheless, I couldn't resist another shot at the xiaolong bao. To accompany it I ordered a couple more of my favorites, savory soy milk (available only on weekends) and green onion pancakes (available daily).\n\nIf anything, the xiaolong bao tasted even better than on my initial visit, probably because I brought more of a hunger with me, and were prettier, wrapped more carefully.\n\nThe savory soy milk (yan doujiang) turne about to be as good as I've had in SF since the early days of Fountain Court, better than Shanghai Dumpling King's version (good in its own right). It was properly sassy, and properly constructed, down to the inclusion of brine shrimp, which are often omitted. (Do they think those teeny little eyes are going to scare anybody?)\n\nThe green onion pancakes (cong you bing) made it three for three. I alsway cross my fingers when ordering this, because there are so many approaches to making it and with many different results, but Shanghai House's version was much to my liking: thick, well-browned and crunchy on the outside and soft and well-seeded with spring onion tops inside.\n\nI talked to the server, who happened to be the daughter of the proprietor. Although she spoke English like an ABC, she had no problem understanding my little Shanghainese. She confirmed that it was a family operation, and said that it was dad who did all the cooking. The other server may have been the mom.\n\nI'll reserve judgement on the regular lunch and dinner fare; our limited sampling of cold apps and rice dishes on our first visit found them to be a hit and miss proposition. But thanks to today's \"hat trick\" (sorry for that, but the Hockey Haven bar is only three doors up the street from SH) I have a new go-to place for Shanghainese eye-openers. \n\n[Update 11/10/07] - I downgraded my rating from 5 stars to a still-generous 4 because I finally got there for dinner.

Also, this place is definitely quite small and I can imagine it being completely packed in here on perhaps a Friday night or weekend night.\n\n2) Wait Time\nMy party of 3 did not have to wait on a Monday night around 7PM.\n\n3) The Food\nWe decided to order the Potstickers, Shanghai Dumplings, Dry Fried Chicken Wings, and Green Onion Pancake.

In addition, it took her about 20 minutes to give us our bill after we asked for it. However, this was OK because we were all having a nice conversation and wasn't in a rush to get out of the restaurant. To be honest, you shouldn't have high expectations on service if you're going to an authentic Chinese restaurant.\n\n5) Pricing\nThe items are definitely leaning towards the pricey end of around $7-$11 per dish.\nI don't know if the chicken wings are worth the ~$11 the menu advertises, but we were all full in the end and finished everything without any leftovers.\n\nKeep in Mind: \nParking may be harder to find, especially with Purple Kow across the street.\nSpeaking of Purple Kow, we went there right after dinner so it's a convenient location for some Dim Sum + Purple Kow combo.\n\n*Final Verdict*\nIf you're looking for a good Dim Sum place and don't care too much about incredible customer service, then this is the place for you.

But service the moment we sat down, absolutely horrible. \n\nThe waitress, which only seemed to be one, was absolutely rude, unkind, unprofessional, and down right unhappy. First, as other reviews stated, her apron didn't seem to be clean whatsoever and neither did the menus given to us to order our food. If you do not like having white people there, please state that, as she did not treat us with respect and had a merry ok time with other mandarin groups. I'm not one to be racist at all, but that is not right.  \n\nThis was my first time here and wanted to order dumplings, which I did, but ordered the wrong kind (I ordered veggie and pork dumplings when I later found out, once my food arrived, that I should have ordered the Shanghai house dumplings.) The 'dumplings' I ordered looked more like potstickers than a dumpling. Disappointed with my meal, I asked the waitress if I could order the Shangahi house dumpling rather and have the incorrect dumplings taken back. She looked at me and said 'no no the cook already made the food, you can not have that taken back at all.' So I was caught off guard and pissed at this point.

Even having to pay was a nightmare. \n\nBRING CASH ONLY! We were not aware of this restaurant being cash only. There was no sign out front, nothing labeled on the menu, and certainly not told by the waitress before hand. We finished our meal and wanted to pay by credit card. Left it on the table as we predicted it would be a hassle to ask for the check. As we waited we finally flagged her down as she was not giving us the time of day otherwise. She approached our table, saw the credit card, picked it up and actually threw it back down on the table stating 'we do not take credit cards, only cash.' With a total disgust on her face. As we did not have any cash on us, I was forced to go to the ATM a block away and get cash for the bill (which isn't a big deal but wish I had known beforehand.) We were so unpleased with this experience. \n\nOn a better note, and the reason I gave it a two star rather than a 1, is because the food was good considering everything else that happened.

I know sometimes a little smokiness can be good, but not in fried rice and not to this degree! The cook should have known not to serve this. I'm surprised they gave it to us to take home.

When my SIL wanted to meet me for lunch and asked me for suggestions, it gave me an early opportunity to check out the newly opened Shanghai House (Jia JIa Fu) restaurant on Balboa with a couple of representatives from my Shanghai contingent in tow.\n\nThere was no doubt about Shanghai House's truly Shanghainese identity, with the server, the other parties there at early lunchtime, and two-thirds of my own party speaking Shanghainese (and me with my usual Yangjingbang). The menu, too, was rock-ribbed Shanghainese cuisine in its offerings, even if some of the \"rice\" dishes turned out to be somewhat eccentric home-style renditions. Unfortunately, some of the Shanghai \"dim sum\" items are only offered on weekends (which isn't made clear in the menu).\n\nWe ordered xiaolong bao; one cold dish (salted duck); a couple of \"rice\" dishes, Shanghai classic \"meicai kourou\" (steamed pork belly with pickled vegetables) and a tofu and seafood clay pot; and one soup, also a Shanghai classic, fried tofu with bean thread noodles.\n\nI was able to approach the xiaolong bao with freshly calibrated taste receptors, having returned from Shanghai just two days before, and am happy to report that they were very good. Only an artlessness in the wrapping (they looked slightly misshapen) and a slight lack of flavor depth in the broth kept them from being the equal of Shanghai Dumpling King's and Oakland's Shanghai Xiao Chi's versions, but at $4.95 for 10 I'm willing to cut them a little slack. I made do with worse at several venues in Shanghai. They also made me vow to return on the weekend to try some of the other Shanghainese brunch items.\n\nThe other dishes were a mixed bag. The salty duck was tasty and lean, but had the appearance of being either too old or suffering from refrigerator burn, showing some discoloration and dryness. The pork belly/mei cai was marred by a too-sweet red sauce, but otherwise good. The tofu and seafood hot pot had fried tofu instead of the expected fresh tofu, and also suffered from a confusion of too many ingredients in it. It was almost as if all the ingredients one might toss into seafood hot-pot in the course of a leisurely hot pot dinner were crammed into a modest clay pot. This is not to say that there was anything leftover-ish about the contents; most of the ingredients appeared to be fresh and cooked just the right amount. If you are a seafood nut, this is the Chinese Cioppino for you.\n\nThe xifen/you doufu soup was the most peculiar of all. It came with an opaque brown broth, though neither I nor the two Shanghainese have ever seen this soup before with anything but a clear broth. It was savory enough, but a bit jarring visually.\n\nI went return ed the following Saturday for lunch, intending to try some of the Shanghainese brunchie stuff only available on weekends. Nonetheless, I couldn't resist another shot at the xiaolong bao. To accompany it I ordered a couple more of my favorites, savory soy milk (available only on weekends) and green onion pancakes (available daily).\n\nIf anything, the xiaolong bao tasted even better than on my initial visit, probably because I brought more of a hunger with me, and were prettier, wrapped more carefully.\n\nThe savory soy milk (yan doujiang) turne about to be as good as I've had in SF since the early days of Fountain Court, better than Shanghai Dumpling King's version (good in its own right). It was properly sassy, and properly constructed, down to the inclusion of brine shrimp, which are often omitted. (Do they think those teeny little eyes are going to scare anybody?)\n\nThe green onion pancakes (cong you bing) made it three for three. I alsway cross my fingers when ordering this, because there are so many approaches to making it and with many different results, but Shanghai House's version was much to my liking: thick, well-browned and crunchy on the outside and soft and well-seeded with spring onion tops inside.\n\nI talked to the server, who happened to be the daughter of the proprietor. Although she spoke English like an ABC, she had no problem understanding my little Shanghainese. She confirmed that it was a family operation, and said that it was dad who did all the cooking. The other server may have been the mom.\n\nI'll reserve judgement on the regular lunch and dinner fare; our limited sampling of cold apps and rice dishes on our first visit found them to be a hit and miss proposition. But thanks to today's \"hat trick\" (sorry for that, but the Hockey Haven bar is only three doors up the street from SH) I have a new go-to place for Shanghainese eye-openers. \n\n[Update 11/10/07] - I downgraded my rating from 5 stars to a still-generous 4 because I finally got there for dinner.

The owner and the Chef themselves are actually Shanghai-nese (I myself come from Shanghai, China) so that brought my expectations even higher. \n\nThe first thing I ordered was the Shanghai pork dumplings. You can't come to a Shanghai-nese restaurant without first trying the dumplings. The dumplings were Good. Juices were flowing inside the skin and the skin itself was not hard - which tells you that they are using the right kind of skin. The meatball inside was also cooked perfectly. So for the dumplings, it has my vote. ::thumbs up:: \n\nI then ordered the Sour and spicy soup - which to my surprise was kind of disappointing. Way too sour for my taste and not spicy at all. Unbalanced and very one-sided. The amount of veggies included in the soup was pretty good, but I couldnt taste any of it due to the overwhelming sour-ness. There was also a slight bitterness that I didn't like. Maybe they derived from the traditional way of making this soup in order to make it more original? I do not know. \n\nFollowing the soup I ordered Fried Tofu. Very nice. Was not deep fried like the other Fried Tofu's out there. The fried skin is very thin - covering the tofu just barely. The tofu was also soft - not firm which is the right way to make fried tofu. This I give my ::thumbs up:: \n\nThe Mongolian Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good. The Kung Pao was definitely spicier than the Mongolian Beef however and the peanuts compliments it very very well. The Mongolian Beef was nice and tender, but I had preferred it to be just as spicy or spicier than the Kung Pao. \n\nOverall, the experience was a good one. The service was okay considering that there's only one waiter there. It would've been nice if they had accepted major credit cards, but I guess it is to keep costs low. A little inconvenient, but bearable. Bank of America is literally a block away on the corner. \n\n\nBottom Line: More or less authentic with some deviation from traditional depending what you get.

Yu Zen and Shanghai House. \n\nWhat did I eat there that made me this excited? Well, the first thing I tried, I ate four or five times before I moved on to anything else and that was the Kung Pao chicken. I tried only that partly because I liked it so much, partly because I got it at least 4 times to go--you can't order from the \"Shanghai\" menu on take out orders--and partly because if you order two orders + rice for two you can feed 4 people (take out) for $20! And that's eating really stand-out Kung Pao--smoky peppers and smoked tofu, lots of veggies (mostly zucchini but it's good here) and tasty chicken. Just right. \n\nMy interest in Chinese Food in my neighborhood (exception of all exceptions: Ton Kiang for brunch) has seriously waned ~ it seemed every time I went for Chinese the last  few years I ate something that was too greasy, too sweet or just not memorable. \n\nTalk about memorable! the Shanghai style Vegetable Soup with hand cut noodles I had here last weekend has been stuck in my savory, sensory memory ever since and I just can't shake it. Out of all three dishes I ate that meal (my friend and I were hungry and determined to sample more of the menu) the said soup was actually the least \"exciting\" dish,  but for some reason it's the one that won out as top memorable sense that I can still \"taste\". I was actually most \"excited\" about the Bok Choy with Wheat Gluten Dumplings. This was amazingly good and yummy with a delicious sauce soaking the dumplings and the perfectly sized baby bok choy (you don't have to make a slippery slimy fool of yourself with these as you do with typically sized bok choy).

I start off the meal with a few orders of cold plate dishes. Neatly assembled, the vegetarian goose ($4.25) appetizer is a great starter. Tender cake make from many thin layers of tofu skin, with a pan fried crispy top, wraps in a meaty shitake mushroom filling. A slight drizzle of red vinegar provide a tang enhancer. Neatly fanned across the plate, the five spice beef ($4.95) was a disappointment.\n\nThe beef lacked flavor and was dry. Served in a bamboo steamer, the pork dumpling (minced pork filling wrapped in a soft house made wonton like skin) revived my taste buds with a burst of soup and tender filling. Braised fish with white wine sauce ($9.95) feature tender flounder. Giving the dish character, crunchy wood ear fungus compliments the soft fish. My least favorite dish was the rice cake - $5.95. Seemingly presented without care, chewy rice cakes are work-tossed with shredded pork and Napa cabbage.\n\nThe stew pork ($7.25) stole the show. Each thinly pork slice flaunts the dual textures of savory meat with a fatty cap. Hiding under the buttery pork, dried vegetables provide a slight savory note. The dark maple sauce brings the entire dish together. An order of fluffy white rich diffused the sweetness.\nHaving been here previously for brunch, the savory rice roll ($2.50) warms up the stomach. Resembling a sushi roll, sticky rice wraps around dried shredded pork and vegetables. The sweet soy bean milk ($1.25) makes a great breakfast drink. The savory soy bean milk is an acquired taste.\n\nDried vegetables, friend Chinese doughnut, along with a drizzle of chilli oil swim in the silky milk. Cut into triangular pizza slices and fried till golden brown, onion pancakes ($3.95) highlights the aroma of fried onion. Enriched in a dark sweet sauce, Shanghai style pan fried noodle (noodles stir fried with cabbage and shredded prok-$5.50) gives patrons a taste of chewy noodles that rounds out a dish.\n\nWhile chef/owner Kam Yuen Lu is busy in the kitchen, wife Teresa Hai serves patrons in the front of the house.

Out of all three dishes I ate that meal (my friend and I were hungry and determined to sample more of the menu) the said soup was actually the least \"exciting\" dish,  but for some reason it's the one that won out as top memorable sense that I can still \"taste\". I was actually most \"excited\" about the Bok Choy with Wheat Gluten Dumplings.

It's basically a roll of tofu skin (read:  many layers), with chinese mushrooms inside (shiitake I believe), fried, and then cut up so it kinda looks like goose breast meat.  flavor and texture were awesome (except I hate mushrooms, so I picked those out).\n\nThe loufa melon with gluten puffs was good--would have been better if they peeled all the skin off the melon to remove the bitterness, but overall it was stir-fried right.  \n\nxiaolongbao has dropped to B-/C+ grade.

Skin was thick, and overall they seemed overcooked.\n\noriginal review:  4/16/07\n---\nFINALLY a passable shanghai restaurant in the city.  FINALLY.\nShanghai dumpling king:  mediocre, heavy handed crap.\nOld shanghai:  decent food, but not shanghai food.\nshanghai noodle house:  decent, but not made with the craftsmanship I'm looking for.\n\nThe xiao long bao were mediocre--B grade.  Some soup, and the skin thickness varied from passably thin to way too thick.  Also, the lack of napa cabbage under the dumplings let the dumplings pop because they stuck to the basket.\n\nBut the stir fried food themselves... were actually decent.  Only had 3 dishes so far, but they were:\n-spinach with tofu \"bai ye\", like tofu skin but a little thicker with a slightly rougher texture.  THis was stir fried beautifully, and the spinach was nice and clean--no sand.  The chicken broth added just enough flavor, soaked up by the bai ye.\n\n-sweet and sour ribs.  ALMOST perfect.  These were black like they should have been, but weren't sour enough to match the sweetness.  Also the ribs were not fried quiet enough--the ribs weren't falling off the bone, and the bones were not edible.  BUT, they were still tasty, using the right black (zhen jiang) vinegar.  We asked for more vinegar and poured it on top, and then it was sour enough.\n\n-wine sauce fish.  ALMOST perfect.  A little too salty, and needed to be a little bit sweeter.  But otherwise, it was stir fried perfectly, and the black wood ear fungus was very tender and just right.\n-salted mustard green (aka snow cabbage, xue cai), edamame (mao dou), pork strand (rou si)  knife-shaved soup noodles (dao xiao tang mian).  On Ed's recommendation, we had to get these knife shaved noodles.  The noodles themselves were the perfect texture and consistency--nice and chewy--though the length and thickness of the noodle could have been better (it's tough to control, and takes a lot of skill to make right, because you shave the noodles directly off of a lump of dough, into the boiling water).  The soup however... had soy sauce in it?!  and was too salty with not enough flavor.  not the tasty, clean, chicken-pork white broth I'm used to for salted mustard green soup noodles.  Still, it was good.  These are all shanghai classic dishes by the way, as we were deliberately testing the chef.\n\nFor dessert, they had fermented rice with mochi rice soup balls (filled with sesame paste).  This is a shanghai classic dessert.  The chef added osmanthus flower, as he's supposed to, and just the right amount.  It totally hit the spot.  They also have an \"eight treasure rice\" (ba bao fan), which is sticky rice (aka sweet rice, mochi rice, or glutinous rice) steamed with 8 \"treasures\" including lotus seeds, red beans, etc, and honey on top.  But we'll have to order it next time.\n\nwith the bill, they brought us half an orange, cut up--as they do in many true chinese restaurants.  no lame-ass fortune cookies here.\n\nI loved it!  I've been forced to lower my shanghai food standards ever since I've come to the city, and this place finally hit the spot.  It's nowhere near best in the bay, but finally, there's a passable shanghai place in the city!\n\n(the large bowl of knife-shaved noodles.. were only 5.75 ea before tax and tip.... my people rule)", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-04-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Faves include potstickers, vegetarian goose, kung pao prawns and anything else we ever order.

The owner and the Chef themselves are actually Shanghai-nese (I myself come from Shanghai, China) so that brought my expectations even higher. \n\nThe first thing I ordered was the Shanghai pork dumplings. You can't come to a Shanghai-nese restaurant without first trying the dumplings. The dumplings were Good. Juices were flowing inside the skin and the skin itself was not hard - which tells you that they are using the right kind of skin. The meatball inside was also cooked perfectly. So for the dumplings, it has my vote. ::thumbs up:: \n\nI then ordered the Sour and spicy soup - which to my surprise was kind of disappointing. Way too sour for my taste and not spicy at all. Unbalanced and very one-sided. The amount of veggies included in the soup was pretty good, but I couldnt taste any of it due to the overwhelming sour-ness. There was also a slight bitterness that I didn't like. Maybe they derived from the traditional way of making this soup in order to make it more original? I do not know. \n\nFollowing the soup I ordered Fried Tofu. Very nice. Was not deep fried like the other Fried Tofu's out there. The fried skin is very thin - covering the tofu just barely. The tofu was also soft - not firm which is the right way to make fried tofu. This I give my ::thumbs up:: \n\nThe Mongolian Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good. The Kung Pao was definitely spicier than the Mongolian Beef however and the peanuts compliments it very very well. The Mongolian Beef was nice and tender, but I had preferred it to be just as spicy or spicier than the Kung Pao. \n\nOverall, the experience was a good one. The service was okay considering that there's only one waiter there. It would've been nice if they had accepted major credit cards, but I guess it is to keep costs low. A little inconvenient, but bearable. Bank of America is literally a block away on the corner. \n\n\nBottom Line: More or less authentic with some deviation from traditional depending what you get.

Yu Zen and Shanghai House. \n\nWhat did I eat there that made me this excited?

Just right. \n\nMy interest in Chinese Food in my neighborhood (exception of all exceptions: Ton Kiang for brunch) has seriously waned ~ it seemed every time I went for Chinese the last  few years I ate something that was too greasy, too sweet or just not memorable. \n\nTalk about memorable! the Shanghai style Vegetable Soup with hand cut noodles I had here last weekend has been stuck in my savory, sensory memory ever since and I just can't shake it. Out of all three dishes I ate that meal (my friend and I were hungry and determined to sample more of the menu) the said soup was actually the least \"exciting\" dish,  but for some reason it's the one that won out as top memorable sense that I can still \"taste\". I was actually most \"excited\" about the Bok Choy with Wheat Gluten Dumplings. This was amazingly good and yummy with a delicious sauce soaking the dumplings and the perfectly sized baby bok choy (you don't have to make a slippery slimy fool of yourself with these as you do with typically sized bok choy). Plus I am a sucker for really yummy \"meat alternatives\". \n\nAnd then to show that I am also a sucker for some meats, I also highly recommend the Tea Smoked Duck. It's so delicious! and for someone like me who doesn't eat meat other than poultry or fish, Duck prepared like this is as tasty and decadent as any pork dish might be (read: fatty and delicious and crispy).\n\nSo yes, you should try this place. But make sure you look at the Shanghai Menu. it's a mysterious practice they have of only giving it to you with the other menu (straight american chinese food?)--so some people may never even see it (esp. if you order take out)\n\nupdate: since this review I've tried a few other notable dishes: the Vegetarian Goose (with shitake mushrooms) is delicious as are the Vegetarian Steamed Dumplings. The Mu Shu Vegetables were just right, too. The Vegetable Soup with hand-cut noodles wasn't as exciting as the first time I had it, but that happens sometimes ; ) Obviously plenty for a vegetarian to eat, although I'm not vegetairian. \n\nupdate #2: Now that I eat all meat, I can rate the Shanghai pork dumplings too--more delicate and nicer than the (notorious) ones up the street. And the Golden Prawns are my new favorite dish! Yum Yum\n\nupdate #3: for some reason, after all of these years, I had never ordered the chicken wings until sometime the end of this last year. Oh my!

I had 4 things actually.  3 didn't come looking appetizing so my asian instinct to take pictures of them just didn't kick in.  They were beef tripes in chili oil, pork and leek dumplings, and mushy pork.  Flavor was ok, but I could tell all the dishes were just low quality cooking.  Sorry but it's true.  The last thing we ordered was the dry fried chicken wings (I have a picture of this).  Omg, TERRIBLE.  The batter was waaaaaay too thick to the point I wasn't sure if I was eating the chicken or the batter.  And the sauce was...well, there was no sauce actually; instead, they're just soaked in chili oil!  Yes!!!  They fried the wings and probably decided they were not oily enough so they drenched the wings in a pool of chili oil.  OMG!  Nooooooooooooo..........\n\nRating:\nIt should really be zero star.

First let's talk food.\n\nShanghai steamed baby dumplings ($8.50) - aka XLB, comes with 10. This was made very well - the skin was nice and thin but strong enough to be transferred onto my spoon without breaking and letting the soup escape. The meat was soft and moist and the soup was great. I found a hair in one of them (ew, but this happens often enough in Chinese restaurants that I'm not even that fazed anymore), and the waitress apologized and quickly brought us a new batch.\nShanghai pan fried dumplings ($11.95) - comes with 8. This came out looking delicious with nicely browned bottoms. The outside was slightly crispy and the meat inside was soft and juicy. Done really well and in a great size, too!\nSavory rice roll ($4.25) - perhaps the smallest rice roll I have ever been served at a restaurant. This meant that there wasn't so much filling, although the actual ratio of filling to rice was good. I personally would have preferred more pork floss inside, but it still tasted good. Only problem was the portion.\nCucumber & bean thread sheet ($9.95) - not bad but expensive for $10. I would have liked less peanut sauce. I took a bite of the leftovers the very next day, and it had a terrible mushy consistency, so definitely finish this the day of if you're going to order it.\nDry fried chicken wings (did not see item on menu) - definitely a disappointment. The basil on top was black and in a clump, which did not look appetizing. The outside was way too hard and crunchy with a thick layer of batter. The sauce itself was decent, but doesn't even hold a candle to San Tung.\n\nService was not good. When we were waiting to order, the lady was just standing behind the counter, where there is a big plant in the way. Not sure if she just couldn't see us or was taking a break, but I saw a customer from another table walk up to put in her order because she had been waiting for a while already. That same lady at the counter yelled into the kitchen so loudly once that a little girl sitting a few tables over said, \"It's so loud!\" hahaha. Two of our items came out separately with the servers not knowing which table they were for - there aren't that many tables in there! When they were confused and looking around, we had to tell them that the dishes were ours. When the waitress took away my soup spoon with the hair in the dumpling, she didn't give me a new spoon until I asked. And finally, we sat next to the door and it didn't close properly so the draft was blowing at us each time someone walked in or out. I am fully aware that some of these things are nitpicky, but when combined with hair in my dumpling, subpar service, and only okay food, this makes for an overall unsatisfactory meal that deserves a rating of \"Meh.

I decide that we should go to Shanghai House because it's new, they had great xiao long bao the last time I was there with Ed M, and there wouldn't be a wait. \n\nWe're seated and I realize that I don't recognize anything on the menu. Hunan prawns? Garlic eggplant? Where's the hand cut pan fried noodles? WHERE'S MY CHINESE FOOD?!\n\nShanghai House has two different menus. Me and Mikey the Whitey got the white man menus while Ed (not M) and Kathleen got the menus with the good stuff. Goddamnit. \n\nBut oh wait, what's this on the white man menu? Dry fried chicken wings? OH SWEET SWEET IRONY. \n\nI order the dry fried chicken wings and they're DELICIOUS. Crispy and golden sweet on the outside, juicy on the inside. Kathleen even made the bold statement that these might be better than San Tung's chicken wings. I'm still on the fence about it but they were oh so good. \n\nExcellent xiao long bao and dry fried chicken wings without the wait?

The owner and the Chef themselves are actually Shanghai-nese (I myself come from Shanghai, China) so that brought my expectations even higher. \n\nThe first thing I ordered was the Shanghai pork dumplings. You can't come to a Shanghai-nese restaurant without first trying the dumplings. The dumplings were Good. Juices were flowing inside the skin and the skin itself was not hard - which tells you that they are using the right kind of skin. The meatball inside was also cooked perfectly. So for the dumplings, it has my vote. ::thumbs up:: \n\nI then ordered the Sour and spicy soup - which to my surprise was kind of disappointing. Way too sour for my taste and not spicy at all. Unbalanced and very one-sided. The amount of veggies included in the soup was pretty good, but I couldnt taste any of it due to the overwhelming sour-ness. There was also a slight bitterness that I didn't like. Maybe they derived from the traditional way of making this soup in order to make it more original? I do not know. \n\nFollowing the soup I ordered Fried Tofu. Very nice. Was not deep fried like the other Fried Tofu's out there. The fried skin is very thin - covering the tofu just barely. The tofu was also soft - not firm which is the right way to make fried tofu. This I give my ::thumbs up:: \n\nThe Mongolian Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good. The Kung Pao was definitely spicier than the Mongolian Beef however and the peanuts compliments it very very well. The Mongolian Beef was nice and tender, but I had preferred it to be just as spicy or spicier than the Kung Pao. \n\nOverall, the experience was a good one. The service was okay considering that there's only one waiter there. It would've been nice if they had accepted major credit cards, but I guess it is to keep costs low. A little inconvenient, but bearable. Bank of America is literally a block away on the corner. \n\n\nBottom Line: More or less authentic with some deviation from traditional depending what you get.

Yu Zen and Shanghai House. \n\nWhat did I eat there that made me this excited? Well, the first thing I tried, I ate four or five times before I moved on to anything else and that was the Kung Pao chicken. I tried only that partly because I liked it so much, partly because I got it at least 4 times to go--you can't order from the \"Shanghai\" menu on take out orders--and partly because if you order two orders + rice for two you can feed 4 people (take out) for $20! And that's eating really stand-out Kung Pao--smoky peppers and smoked tofu, lots of veggies (mostly zucchini but it's good here) and tasty chicken. Just right. \n\nMy interest in Chinese Food in my neighborhood (exception of all exceptions: Ton Kiang for brunch) has seriously waned ~ it seemed every time I went for Chinese the last  few years I ate something that was too greasy, too sweet or just not memorable. \n\nTalk about memorable! the Shanghai style Vegetable Soup with hand cut noodles I had here last weekend has been stuck in my savory, sensory memory ever since and I just can't shake it. Out of all three dishes I ate that meal (my friend and I were hungry and determined to sample more of the menu) the said soup was actually the least \"exciting\" dish,  but for some reason it's the one that won out as top memorable sense that I can still \"taste\". I was actually most \"excited\" about the Bok Choy with Wheat Gluten Dumplings. This was amazingly good and yummy with a delicious sauce soaking the dumplings and the perfectly sized baby bok choy (you don't have to make a slippery slimy fool of yourself with these as you do with typically sized bok choy). Plus I am a sucker for really yummy \"meat alternatives\". \n\nAnd then to show that I am also a sucker for some meats, I also highly recommend the Tea Smoked Duck. It's so delicious! and for someone like me who doesn't eat meat other than poultry or fish, Duck prepared like this is as tasty and decadent as any pork dish might be (read: fatty and delicious and crispy).\n\nSo yes, you should try this place. But make sure you look at the Shanghai Menu. it's a mysterious practice they have of only giving it to you with the other menu (straight american chinese food?)--so some people may never even see it (esp. if you order take out)\n\nupdate: since this review I've tried a few other notable dishes: the Vegetarian Goose (with shitake mushrooms) is delicious as are the Vegetarian Steamed Dumplings. The Mu Shu Vegetables were just right, too. The Vegetable Soup with hand-cut noodles wasn't as exciting as the first time I had it, but that happens sometimes ; ) Obviously plenty for a vegetarian to eat, although I'm not vegetairian. \n\nupdate #2: Now that I eat all meat, I can rate the Shanghai pork dumplings too--more delicate and nicer than the (notorious) ones up the street. And the Golden Prawns are my new favorite dish! Yum Yum\n\nupdate #3: for some reason, after all of these years, I had never ordered the chicken wings until sometime the end of this last year. Oh my!

The pan fried dumplings were also good - the skin on the bottoms nicely browned and crisp. Not overly generous with the filling (I'd say about 40%) but the inside is moist and flavorful.

Pretty delicious and a good amount of pork in each dumpling. They do not fail on the soup inside! The trick is to use your spoon and directly transport from chopstick to spoon ASAP! However, the skin on the dumplings are thick compared to shanghai dumpling king up the street. These are satisfying but definitely not my go to for dumplings. The better part is less wait than up the block and it will still satisfy your craving.\n\n\nShanghai style rice cake - great ingredients with a good amount of pork, cabbage and rice cake but really lacks flavor! It was not salty at all and I had to add soy sauce. I usually never do this at any restaurant cause the flavor from the meats with already added salt and soy sauce should do the trick.\n\nHand-cut shanghai noodles - same concept as the rice cake but with their hand cut noodles. Hand cut noodles had a good texture, but this noodle dish also lacked salt and flavor!  They can definitely improve on this.\n\nGreen onion pancake - delicious, crispy and a good amount of green onion! \n\npan fried baos - prob the best dish after the chicken wings and dumplings =)  highly recommend!!!!\n\nThe best part is that these dishes do not kill your pockets.

There is something magical about these nearly transparent skinned XLB (code for these dumplings I have picked up from reading fellow yelpers); when I wash up in the shower and gingerly soap the sacs, I sometimes picture twin XLB's hanging.   Eating these dumplings take years and years of experience and practice.  The science of it is it is delicately picking it up by its foreskin cleanly, as to not let any juices leak, plopping it into soy sauce, then laying it on your tongue and sliding it into your mouth.  I have had Shanghai Dumpling King nearby which was pretty good, however KDer told me that Shanghai House had dumplings that were renown and comparable if not better.  I could eat 3-4 treys of XLB's at Shanghai Dumpling King so I was hesitant if anything else could compare.  \n\nThis place is always crowded.  Unlike Shanghai Dumpling King which is a dump, this place is somewhat modern.  There is even a glass door.  However, beware of this aesthetic beauty.  It does not close completely, and any gust of wind will jar it open, letting in a cold draft of pneumonia.  Because there is so much ingoing and outgoing traffic, my teeth would have been chattering if not for the dry chicken wings.  As of all Chinese restaurants, waitresses do not engage you in banter.  They jot down your order, bring it to you and try to get you to leave as soon as possible.  There is not even the slightest hint of a smile.  We ordered:  \n\n1.  xiao long bao: 4/5  These shanghai dumplings were good, however, inferior to that of Shanghai Dumpling King.  First off, the outside dough was a little too thick as opposed to the nearly translucent skin of Dumpling King.  As a result, it was a little heavier to eat and fills you up faster.  A plus is that because of a thicker outer skin, they are less apt to break, spilling out succulent juices.  These dumplings are also very small, so while there are 10 mini bundles of joy, you can chow through them pretty fast.\n\n2.  pork dumplings: 3/5  These pork dumplings were shaped differently from the original baos.  These were decent.  Again, the dough exterior was thicker than I would have liked.  The pork was tasty inside, however, nothing was truly outstanding.  It was an average dish.\n\n3.  shanghai panfry noodles: 3/5  This was a KDer dish and she made sure to get it vegetarian, stripping the order of its meat.  Curse her.  The noodles were very greasy.  In addition, I am not a fan of those really thick noodles.  I prefer the thin chow mein type noodles.  We ordered too much so I really didn't eat eat much of this until the next day.  It was good as a instant lunch, however, I believe it was more a product of my hunger than to the testament of the noodles.  A pile of oil and grease rested on my plate after the noodles were gone.\n\n4.  dry chicken wings: 5/5  I've had the original dry chicken wings at San Tungs and I will say these are delicious and just a small notch below the original innovators.  These dry chicken wings were spicy.  In addition, they arrived piping hot, and because I was too hungry to wait for them to cool, I alternated between blowing the chicken, taking a bite, and blowing my fingers to alleviate the minor 3rd degree burns being afflicted upon them.  While an order of San Tung's wings are more in quantity, Shanghai House's wings are much bigger.  There is more meat on these wings.  The caramelized sauce is too money and this dish made the meal.  \n\nShanghai House is affordable like 99.9% of Chinese restaurants, however, they do jack their price an extra dollar or two due to all the media hoopla they have received.  They proudly paste their accolades on the glass window.  I am not the biggest fan of Chinese food.  As I have said countless times, I believe their food to be overly sauced and greasy.  In addition, service is non-existant but you cannot hold a Chinese restaurant to that standard.  If you are tired of waiting in line for San Tungs tho, come here.  To be honest, I can't say San Tung is a clear cut favorite.  These wings can hold San Tung wings' jock.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-07-24"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered:\n\n- Shanghai Soup Dumplings from their Appetizer menu\n- Combination Fried Rice \n- Dry Chicken Wings\n- 2 coke sodas\n\nand "], "author": "Frugal C.", "review": "I go to this area in the outer richmond a lot and after seeing all the great reviews for this place, I decided to give it a try.  It's a very small place with only a few tables so I would NOT go in large groups of more than 4.  I went around 330pm on Friday and it's best to go at this time or earlier since there is NO waiting line.  In fact, there were only 2 other tables that were being served.  (Also, it's best to go when they open since they have lunch specials at cheaper prices available from 11am-3pm.)  I ordered:\n\n- Shanghai Soup Dumplings from their Appetizer menu\n- Combination Fried Rice \n- Dry Chicken Wings\n- 2 coke sodas\n\nand if you fill up your tummy real fast like me, that's ALL you should be ordering.  They give you a generous plate of each.  I have to back up what others say about the service -  you have to be aggressive about wanting to order from your menu, paying, wanting sodas or water, spoons/forks/extra napkins, etc. This is an asian place in a mainly asian neighborhood (as can be seen by the MANY asian restaurants and asian bank on balboa street) so service will naturally not be the best out there. If you want 5 star service, this would NOT be a place I would recommend.\n\nHowever, the food was pretty good.  I had never tried xlb, or Shanghai Soup Dumplings, but they were to die for!  They gave me about 10 dumplings in a bamboo steam pot tray.  I just totally ignored their hard-to-eat with chopsticks and used their soup spoon to bring the dumplings from the bamboo pot tray  to my mouth and I was pleasantly surprised to see the soup INSIDE the pork dumplings (even though mentally I had already read about this in the reviews).  They ARE hot so you have to be careful (I'm glad I had my ice-cold coke sodas handy nearby which I quickly gulped right after swallowing the dumplings), but they are SOOOOOO good and filling with their light medium dumpling skins.  I think I could have gotten another order or two of dumplings, been full  and called it a day!    \n\nBut I ordered the other dishes earlier and decided to finish those off too.  After all, I'm always in the area and could go back to dine here at one of those other times.  And I'll DEFINITELY remember to bring a lot of napkins/paper towels to handle those soup dumpling spills! :-)  I loved the large chicken wings which were sweet and VERY hot - there were about 8-10 large pieces.  The combination fried rice was a surprise - it had LETTUCE in it which I've never seen before in the usual chinese fried rice but they give you a lot of big large shrimp as well as  a few large other items in it.  What I noticed about the fried rice was there were clumps of white rice because the rice had not been mixed thoroughly with the meat, but it was still a tasty accompaniment to the wings.  I WAS able to use my credit card and my order was only about $30.  I was able to bring home leftovers of 4 wings.
