Now with many other choices, I guess it has fallen down the pecking order. \n\nThe place has a nice vibe to it. Really roomy and comfortable. Virtually empty tonight as I went in; total of three tables including mine. Yet service was not good. Too examples: 1) I waited a long time to order even with so few tables. 2) when my order came I asked for bowls, the waiter didn't came right back and my wife told me that he went to give something to another table before he came to ours. That is poor service. Even if the other table asked for something, I asked first so you should have brought what I asked for first. To me, that is bad service.\n\nFood was average at best. We ordered the chicken satay. It was ok. The chicken was tender enough but the spice was not to my liking. But my son liked it so I'm happy about that.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp fried rice and th Pad see ew noodles. The fried rice was tasty but a little greasy. It also had a peppery aftertaste that is still in the back of my throat as I write this (2 hours later). The Pad see ew is on their lunch menu but not their dinner menu? How weird is that? So I guess the portion size that came was the lunch portion? That was my only rational for a size that was literally so small I was shocked when I saw it. I contemplated asking the waiter but decided against it. So how small was it? It was about four tablespoons worth. That was it. I literally served a portion to my wife, a spoonful to my son, and what was left was a few strands of noodles left. Wow. I guess it's just enough for me to try it, huh? Anyway it too had a peppery aftertaste. I didn't like it at all.\n\nMy wife did like the Thai Ice tea. She said it was one of the best she's tasted in a while. I'm glad that turned out good.\n\nNot really desirous of coming back here.
