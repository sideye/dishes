They're still beer and wine only.  They started us with a sparkling wine that wasn't quite a sparkling rose, and it was nice to start. \n\nFood:\n1. Agua Fresca with basil, jicama, cucumber, celery, fennel. Light and refreshing, not particularly sweet \n2. Squid ink tostada: one of the memorable dishes from last time.  With saut\u00e9ed Monterey squid, serranos, and house made guacamole\n3. Sope: a black bean and chickpea fritter topped with smoked cotija, trout roe, and watermelon radish \n4. Sterling white sturgeon caviar on super sweet scallop crudo (marinated in a chile citrus broth)\n5. Sorbet: refreshing and citrusy. It was made of mandarin orange and jicama, topped with chia seeds, pea sprouts, and jicama slices \n6. Yerba buena fruit cup: a traditional chili pepper-lime juice-lemon juice marinade over local greens, fruits, and vegetables \n7. Frijoles: three types of beans including cranberry beans and white beans. The textures and flavors were so rich and hearty you can't believe it's vegetarian. I don't even like beans, but this was my favorite dish \n8. Green onion and cilantro sourdough: house made, with Strauss butter \n9. Lobster soup: caldo with lobster, Chinese celery (a thinner, more flavorful type), and Mexican cucumber \n10. Menudo: Amazing! Hen of the wood mushrooms and piccini mushrooms, goat cheese, and *drumroll...\" fried tripe. This makes tripe so much more appealing\n11. Grilled sword fish: seared on one side, served with a ginger habanero sauce, fried leeks, acorn squash, and habaneros\n12. Squab broth: with chipotle pepper and huckleberries - super fragrant. It's a tease for the next course\n13. Roasted squab: grilled and smoked, with persimmon mole and goose berries \n14. Fermented sourdough biscuits: flaky, not dry, very flavorful\n15. Masa tamale: with Hudson valley foie and cherries\n16. Arroz con leche: with poached apple, candied almond, and horchata - way more interesting than regular rice pudding \n17.

There are no other Mexican restaurants with two michelin stars in the county, so it's the best you will get in the USA.   This past xmas, I ate at Quintonil and Pujol in Mexico City, and this is on par with those places.   I would still rank Quintonil as the gold standard, but Californios is better than Pujol imho.\n\nI like the space.   Kind of small, but intimate without feeling too enclosed or claustrophobic.   We sat at the chef's counter which is highly recommended if you are flying solo or a party of two.   I love watching all of the chefs prepare my food.   It's like tv!\n\nThe menu was roughly 18 courses, so I will not describe every single dish, so I will hit on some highlights, but all of it was great.\n\nThe openers they serve you are a great way to start a meal.   Scallop tostada, some crab and blood orange thing, agua fresca, and some weird chicharron made from barley and some other vegetative material.  All were fantastic.\n\nNext were the tacos.   Once was uni, one was mushroom and one was squab.   It's hard to pick a favorite, but the squab was served with this AMAZING mole dipping sauce that I am still dreaming about.\n\nThere was also this kampachi ceviche that was cured in smoked nopales.   There were pieces of the nopales folded into the kampachi, which was thinly sliced and wrapped into a butterfly shape.   The best part honestly was the juice/sauce which had hints of the nopales, citrus and celery.\n\nAsparagus in poblano sauce with roe.   Enough said.\n\nTres frijoles - This seems to be a dish that never leaves the menu.   Three layers of bean preparations and topped with caviar.   Really great (although cannot top the beans they served at Quintonil, of course)\n\nCarne Asada - wow!   Perfectly cooked piece of wagyu, topped with truffle \"mole\" and served with a confit aged potato all with shaved black truffle on top.   Really rich and luxurious.\n\nChurro with plantain - Great!\n\nPear dessert - one of the best desserts I have ever had.   Pear ice cream with dulce de leche served on top of macadamia nut butter.   Divine!\n\n\nService, of course, was on point (as you would expect) and the overall experience was impeccable.

Californios calls themselves \"Mexican fine dining\" but I found the food to be more Californian with Mexican influences. There's two tasting menus (meat or vegetarian) for $57 pp and wine pairings are an additional $35 (I received 4 pours). There's an 18% service charge that's shared among the entire staff. \n\nSimilar to omakase, the chef (formerly Sons & Daughters) and his sous chefs prepare a series of gorgeous dishes using the best seasonal ingredients available. The portions are small but it's not any different than the portions I've had at Saison, Manresa, and Atelier Crenn; and their tasting menus are $185-$298+. Did I contemplate on stopping by Escape from New York Pizza down the block afterwards? You betcha my fatass did but we didn't. But for $57, this is a super reasonably cost tasting menu which I doubt they're making much profit from.\n\n~ * ~ T A S T I N G  M E N U ~ * ~ \nSince we didn't get to see the menu until the end of dinner which has a vague one word descriptor, my descriptions may be a little off or incomplete: http://bit.ly/14pFcc6.\n\n(1) Chips & Salsa w/ trout roe: http://bit.ly/14ds3SB\n(2) Huckleberry Granita w/ \"pop rocks\": http://bit.ly/1Faspul\n(3) Foraged Salad: http://bit.ly/1rXBpgs\n(4) a.

Of course there were a few missteps (the granitas) but they're still testing things out so that's to be expected. \n\nThe fancy play on \"chips & salsa\" with a burst of saltiness from the trout roe was lovely start to the tasting menu. Loved the deliciously smoky and meaty mackerel, and the kampachi crudo was amazingly fresh. Loved the plate it was presented on which gave it illusion that the crudo was smoking. \n\nThe chicken soup was the best damn chicken soup I've had. The broth had some serious depth of flavor going on with a pop of sweet tartness from the pomegranate. The sous-vide chicken breast? Incredibly silky and tender. \n\nMr. NSS and I are lengua whores. The lengua mole was deliciously satisfying and oh so tender. Don't knock it until you've tried it because lengua is one of most underrated cuts. \n\nThe only thing I didn't care for were the intermezzo granitas. Maybe because of the cold weather?\n\nThe blood orange ice cream and chocolate mousse was decadent yet light. And, my eyes glistened when I heard the \"F\" word. The forbidden fruit in ice cream form savory sweet goodness in a scoop. Mr. NSS' know how much I love the \"F\" word and gave me his share. \n\nBoth the crumbly Mexican cookies with a drizzle of dulce de leche (instead of powdered sugar), and the sweet heat from the chili mango gelee were addictive.\n\nMy only suggestion is to add a bread course as a filler. I remember the best part of Sons & Daughter's tasting menu were their bread courses. Dat pretzel bread doe. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nFor the second night of opening, I thought the staff was on point and very well polished. From the hostess to the sommelier, everyone was really amiable, warm, and attentive. I just read that the front of the house is a French Laundry alum which all then made sense (love that place to pieces). \n\nWe sat at the chef's counter which started off really quiet but as the night progressed, the chefs were a little more engaging. \n\nFrom start to finish, the tasting menu took about 90 minutes. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nCozy and romantic, Californios is a great date place. There's only seating for 25 and seats at the chef's counter so reservations are a must. I appreciated that the counter seats were very comfortable (read: wide and cushioned) for my tush. Growing up in the 90s, it was nostalgic to hear Boyz II Men and Usher playing in the background. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nDifficult.

Place is pretty small but also was pretty packed especially given that this is their first week being open! The place definitely gives off an interesting vibe. It's got a dark/romantic/intimate atmosphere with interesting RNB/rap songs playing in the background. I love it. So Mission. It's also very much in line with this new affordable fine dining SF scene (i.e. this place reminded me of The Palace--great food, small place, though this place is definitely more aesthetically pleasing)\n\nIt's fine dining in the sense that the food is so top notch, but service sometimes feels a little awkward and not super natural yet--I'm sure it'll get better as the waitresses get more comfortable. My friend and I didn't order any alcohol and our waitress expressed some very noticeable disapproval/sadness which was a little awkward lol.\n\nI'll let my photos speak for themselves, but here's a brief rundown of the dishes we had:\n\nChips--yummy crisp sweet tangy tortilla chips that went super well with the fish roe on top! truly a burst of citrusy goodness\n\nHielo--huckleberry & lemon lime ice with pop rocks!! such a fun dish\n\nCrudo--basically tasted like Japanese sashimi but better. the jalapeno added a nice pop of flavor, the base of the dish was also tangy and citrusy.

My favorite. my god it was amazing . The lengua mole was so soft and tender. Came with a caramelized onion that went really well with a citrusy avocado thick sauce\n\nChoc--blood orange ice cream with chocolate and coffee flavored stuff; pretty good\n\nFoie--foie gras ice cream with apple pieces and crumble--felt like a deconstructed apple pie. The ice cream was really good but honestly if you lied and told me it was caramel ice cream I would have believed it\n\nDulce--Mexican wedding cookie was super soft and yummy & the mango gummy was an excellent end!\n\nAt $57/person, I think this place is a huge bargain. They do automatically tack in the 18% service tax into your bill so be aware of that when you're paying. I'm not typically a fan of Mexican food, but this didn't even feel like Mexican food.

Not to mention, the out-of-this-world flawless service.\n\nCalifornios has perfected the art of timing, presentation, unique flavor combinations that is becoming harder and harder to find in most Michelin-star restaurants. Comparing to other experiences over the years with others that have made the list, you can almost always find the service lacking or under-compensating in some form. By that I mean friendly, humble people who pay attention to detail. \n\nThere was barely a moment that passed once a dish was finished or a glass was drained that the next form of cutlery or wine pairing was out to dazzle. From wiping the wine label clean for a better visual of the wine specifics to allowing us to \"pick our weapon\" for the lamb course, the staff made it feel like I was part of an exceptional experience.\n\nModern looks and music, no pretenses or fuss with stuffy decor. You'll go the first 7-8 courses without silverware, if you can believe it! It's precisely the way you should want every Michelin-star to behave.\n\nMoving onto the culinary excursions and the wine itself; the pairings were unusually delightful. A sour beer served alongside a rich broth? More please. Grilled asparagus to mate with a difficult Gr\u00fcner Veltliner? Who knew there was such a match in heaven! (P.s. the bright green notes together tasted like Sweet Tarts or Gummie Bears and highly recommend you try this combo at home with dinner guests!). The famous tres frijoles is as stellar as they say and I still can't stop talking about my first sourdough tortilla with pigeon and mole. You stole my heart with a Rioja Tempranillo to go with the most exceptionally rare lamb chop and now all I want to do is go back to Spain.\n\nMy only advice, make sure you go wash your hands after the smoked hen-of-the-woods mushroom taco. It was a bit too smoky for my tastes and it will overpower the next few dishes that you'll eat with your hands.\n\nFull disclosure: I had a non-seafood adjustment and they were wonderfully accommodating.

One of the personal goals I set for myself this year was to eat at all of the 33 Michelin-starred restaurants within the San Francisco city limits and Californios was number 30 out of 33. At this point in my culinary journey, I've become really, really picky but I'm glad to report that this restaurant is definitely in my top 3 so far (the other two are Quince and Atelier Crenn).  \n\nWhat I really love about this menu is that it was incredibly balanced and there was a great respect for ingredients and rhythm to the meal (similar to Japanese kaiseki) while also providing great desserts (to me, the weakest part of Japanese kaiseki meals are the desserts at the end).  Not everything was perfect but the combination of dishes and flavors just work. \n\n(1).  Canap\u00e9s included scallop ceviche, crab tostada, black barley chicharron with smoked\ngoat cheese - served with a refreshing cucumber agua fresca (5/5) - damn good start to the meal.\n(2). Taco ensemble including uni (Santa Barbara), A5 wagyu, smoked mushrooms and squab (5/5) - amazingly, the mushrooms easily beat the others. \n(3).  Palate cleanser included guava sorbet with pineapple juice and bee pollen (5/5). \n(4).  The next three courses included kiwi, kampachi ceviche and asparagus with trout roe (3/5) - good dishes but not stand-outs relative to similar dishes at other restaurants in the city. \n(5.). Smoked chicken broth (5/5) - I really appreciate that they had a consomm\u00e9 in the middle of the meal to prepare you for the coming richer courses. This broth was just perfect. \n(6).  Next came their signature dish - tres frijoles with caviar (3.5/5) - the beans were great with the caviar but this is not the most memorable thing on the menu (other restaurants have signature dishes that are memorable like the ridged pasta with foie, black truffle and Marsala at Acquerello or the Kir Breton at Atelier Crenn).  \n(7).  White sturgeon grilled robata style with grilled cabbage (5/5) - the glaze on the sturgeon was unexpectedly perfect.\n(8).  Lamb with morels (3/5) - acceptable lamb dish but most of the Michelin-starred restaurants in the city serve amazing lamb dishes (the best one I've had was at Lazy Bear) and this was middle of the pack. \n(9).  I ordered the marshmallow tea with chamomile before the sweet courses (4/5) - this was nice and complemented the desserts well. \n(10).  The desserts included churro, strawberries and pecans (5/5) - these were inventive and great and not too heavy.  I would have loved to have gotten some mignardises but I was perfectly content with these three things. \n(11).  The meal started with proseco (great meals start with some bubbly) and ended with some agave (unique and nice touch).  \n\nThe outstanding dishes for me were the smoked mushroom taco, the smoked chicken broth and the glaze on the sturgeon.  \n\nService was impeccable and I am very grateful to have been seated at the bar.  It's like dinner and a show - it was a real treat to see the chefs meticulously prepare each course and chef Will was also very engaging (a treat for solo diners).  The place is immaculate and I really love the upscale but not stuffy vibe of this place.

I would still rank Quintonil as the gold standard, but Californios is better than Pujol imho.\n\nI like the space.   Kind of small, but intimate without feeling too enclosed or claustrophobic.

Scallop tostada, some crab and blood orange thing, agua fresca, and some weird chicharron made from barley and some other vegetative material.  All were fantastic.\n\nNext were the tacos.   Once was uni, one was mushroom and one was squab.   It's hard to pick a favorite, but the squab was served with this AMAZING mole dipping sauce that I am still dreaming about.\n\nThere was also this kampachi ceviche that was cured in smoked nopales.   There were pieces of the nopales folded into the kampachi, which was thinly sliced and wrapped into a butterfly shape.   The best part honestly was the juice/sauce which had hints of the nopales, citrus and celery.\n\nAsparagus in poblano sauce with roe.   Enough said.\n\nTres frijoles - This seems to be a dish that never leaves the menu.   Three layers of bean preparations and topped with caviar.

Perfectly cooked piece of wagyu, topped with truffle \"mole\" and served with a confit aged potato all with shaved black truffle on top.

Perhaps a little too pretentious but certainly very refined.  The way they serve the food is also beautiful but totally over the top.  We had different types of dishes and utensils with every course.  Golden spoons, tiny wooden spoons, two-pronged forks, vintage marble chargers, tiny tea plates with gilded skulls. It's not BAD, it's just so silly!  We were all giggling over the ridiculously specific utensils.  I don't know if all that is necessary - it takes the focus off of the food in a sort of unwelcomed way.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and funky.  The main dining room has an open kitchen and is decorated sort of in a fancy, masculine 80's throw back sort of way.  The bathroom is totally trippy with changing color neon lights.

I was at Al's the night before and the fact that we were celebrating my birthday was completely ignored. They didn't even verbally wish me a happy birthday.\n\nThen they came out to check if we had any dietary restrictions. This was even AFTER they went over the menu with us on the phone to make sure that we were ok with all of the ingredients. Did I mention that we had a 9 pm reservation and since someone canceled their 8 pm reservation, that they actually called us to ask us if we wanted to eat earlier!?! of course!!!!\n\nAlso, they were very considerate when they designed the restaurant. The tables for 2 are about a third wider than your average 2 top and there is actually space between tables. He could easily fit another table and have us all sitting on top of each other but he didn't. Don't you hate it when you're practically sitting on the person next to you and you can hear their conversation better than your own?

With every dish came a change in table settings and with a complete explanation of where the ingredients were sourced and if there was some story behind it. For example, did you know that the Caesar salad was invented in Mexico? I sure didn't. There were also a lot of nice thought out touches. For example, I ordered coffee at the end and the cream that came out with it was actually heated up to prevent it from cooling your coffee down. \n\nThere was also not one bad dish.

It almost feels like a throwback to more traditional fine dining spaces but the classy understated primary colors, table settings and service are balanced with secondary modernist art, design touches, and music selections that give away the true spirit of this establishment: this isn't Gary Danko - this is a very modern, very San Francisco creative collective ready to run wild on your palate.\n\nThe food and wine at Californios is outstanding. As you've probably read, every dish comes from a tradition of Mexican cooking and those flavors are absolutely present in big, bold ways in the dishes. Some dishes are eclectic takes on more traditional comfort food classics like Queso Fundido and tacos, but each is exploding with flavor that will make you rethink what great Mexican preparation is. Wagyu steak here is always cooked to perfection and served with the most delicious accompaniments, my favorite of which was a grilled tomato that had such a perfect smoked, slight charred preparation.

However, over a month later, I am still thinking how surprised we were by our meal and that as area residents who love and follow food, we have a responsibility to share the good and bad, especially when a meal costs $150 per person not including drinks or gratuity.\n\nWe arrived on time and were greeted by friendly staff. They offered to take our coats and seated us right away. Our primary waiter was quite effusive, clearly enthusiastic about what was about to unfold. He asked perhaps a few too many questions about us and why we were there, how we knew each other, where we were from originally, etc. but we politely answered anyway. \nThen he explained the set menu and pairing options. \n\nWe began with spicy margaritas and we were off. \n1) an agua fresca to awaken the palate\n2) an uni tostada with delicate greens and edible flowers balanced beautifully on a blue corn vehicle to deliciousness. \n3) The lechon or pork belly that followed was one of the most memorable dishes of the night. Perfectly seasoned with a cucumber-creme fraiche up top, the morsels of meat were savory and satisfying. As in, don't talk to me while I am enjoying this.\n4) Ceviche was a generous cup of fresh ikura with avocado crema. Those pearls of salmon roe were extraordinary and burst in the mouth with incredible flavor. \n5) Hielo was a refreshing, iced berry palate cleanser. Not too sweet, and still icy, kind of like a nice granita.\n6) Fruit Cup of assorted fresh local vegetables hand selected by the chef. It was fantastic -- some raw, some lightly grilled or blanched and bright. \n7) Frijoles, presented as a type of chawan mushi, and rather salty. The problem with a savory custard like that is you expect real treasures in there, and get less excited by beans.\n8) Lima, the lime-infused broth was one we all said we wanted to recreate. \n\nSounds glorious, right? Unfortunately, here is when the salt really set in.\n9) Huevos featured a delicately crafted egg coddled \"like the chef's grandmother used to make\". However, the dish was so salty we could barely taste the other ingredients, let alone the caviar on top. \n10) Abulon or abalone was a good recovery, balanced in a nice broth with simple veggies. \n11) Tamarindo was a wonderful surprise because it was all about the sauce yet accompanied by a slice of fresh trout, the skin crispy and flesh medium rare -- altogether perfectly prepared, with sugar snap peas. \n12) Quesadilla was a let down, a salty, grilled stomach-filler of carbs and mushrooms. I didn't even finish it.\n13) Cordero - lamb - was the biggest letdown of all. It arrived looking fabulous, a short cylinder of meat prepared as if for a culinary magazine of the first order. A dollop of mole sauce beckoned, as did an mound of freshly grilled green onion that had a slight char. But the lamb, alas -- what was to be the highlight of the meal -- was salty verging on inedible. 3 of the 4 of us returned this dish without taking more than one or two bites when it was meant to be the \"piece de resistance\" according to our chatty waiter. The green onions were delicious, but it is bad when the best part of a dish is the side. \n\nThe rest of the courses were desserts -- \n14) Berry flan, tight and not too sweet.\n15) Platano was a flavorful banana ice cream, and fresh caramel sauce added to your liking, my favorite of the three closers. \n16) Pastel, a white birthday cake with frosting and sprinkles seemed like a novel way to finish for novelty's sake. \n\nOverall...\nWas it a good meal? Sure, pretty good. Would I go back? Probably not.

We had different types of dishes and utensils with every course.  Golden spoons, tiny wooden spoons, two-pronged forks, vintage marble chargers, tiny tea plates with gilded skulls.

After a greet and check in, I was escorted to the chef's counter to begin my journey.\n\nIt is hard to describe the next two hours since the menu changes all the time. The dinner had 19 servings of various small plates, amuses, and cleansers designed to really push the envelope of Mexican inspired cuisine with a gourmet California theme. The beverage pairings included wine, beer, and several surprises which worked very well with the items. Pairing wine with spicy food is a real art.\n\nThe food was just spectacular. The scallop chicharron, torched mandarin, mushroom mole taco, and winter vegetable aquachile were very unique and delicious. The fried fish, wagyu carne asada, and smoked squab were true gourmet quality. The macadamia nut sorbet with fresh pear and dulce de leche was both real and spectacular!\n\nIt is no understatement to say that the best parts of the meal were the tamale, beans, and churro. Of course the tamale used specially grown corn masa ground for hours into a near fudge consistency stuffed with perfect beans and cheese. The bean dish is beyond words with cooked whole beans topped with pur\u00e9ed and whipped beans and caviar bringing the concept to another level. The churro is made with foie gras in the batter and in the icing and served with a small Mexican chocolate and coffee liqueur cocktail making this signature dish crazy delicious.\n\nOf course, the staff and chefs here are near perfection.

There are no more than 5-8 tables inside, as well as a bar area where you can sit in front of the chefs.  The walls have colorful Mexican art adorning them, and in the background upbeat hip hop, rap, and pop are playing. \n\nThe result is a really unique feel - it's casual, fun, and lively, yet still has the professional polish of a typical Michelin restaurant. \n\nThe food was insanely good. They don't give you the menu until the very end, and as a result the entire dinner is a surprise, which I really liked. \n\nI can honestly say I loved every single item on the menu.

It is the most consistently good Michelin restaurant I've ever been to - at others I've often had one or two dishes which were \"meh\". \n\nThe food is also very unique.

Worth it for a special occasion but I wouldn't make this a regular go-to spot.\n\nOnce inside, Californios feels like your distant rich uncle's Upper East Side living room, complete with bookshelves and real books.

They don't crowd the tables and give you plenty of room, so even with the large space, there were relatively few tables compared to some restaurants that barely give you elbow room between tables.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Great! The staff were friendly, knowledgable, and made the vibe more casual and comfortable (the price tag and the decor would otherwise have pointed to a more pretentious place). \n\nTHE COST: Pricey! $100 for the tasting, $45 for the drink pairing, all before tax/tip.\n\nTHE FOOD: There's no pressure of looking at a menu and deciding. The tasting menu is set every night, and they save each course as a surprise (though they will ask about dietary restrictions, allergies, etc). Once your party is settled, the courses start coming out and gradually work their way up into richer, more filling small plates.

The menu seems to change quite frequently in terms of what's in season, so to make this a little bit more meaningful, I'll just highlight some of things we had that night.\n\nFavorite dishes:\n- Celery root apple granita with kiwi\n- In-house made sliced bread with flaxseed served with a house made chicken stock soup aged 5 days with parsnip and turnip\n- Sourdough tortillas with house made butter\n- Sonoma duck served with a shiso reduction and pico de gallo\n- Foie gras vanilla ice cream served with peanut brittle and banana\n\nAll five dishes completely nailed it.  My husband was a big fan of the granita and duck, and I was seriously drooling over the bread and tortillas.  The duck was served Japanese robata style and had a delicious smoky flavor to it.  And let's talk about the foie gras ice cream.  Absolutely no over-the-top foie gras taste, you get a SUPER rich and buttery vanilla ice cream taste instead.  It's pure genius.\n\nDishes that we were \"meh\" on:\n- Yellowtail with serrano chili oil\n- Oyster with jicama\n- Chawanmushi with caviar and blue corn tortilla chips\n\nThe yellowtail wasn't cut evenly and in fairly large pieces, so it was a little bit more than a mouthful when trying to eat it.  The oyster and chawanmushi weren't over the top, and the caviar on the chawanmushi seemed to overdo the umami taste I think it was going for.\n\nService wise, Californios did an amazing job with spacing out our dishes in a even way, and the person in charge of the wine program (my husband had the wine pairing with his meal) did an amazing job explaining each glass that was being poured with the upcoming dishes. Sitting at the bar was also a good experience and we got to see how hard the guys in the kitchen were working to put together some beautifully plated dishes.\n\nAt $75, Californios is definitely on the pricey side (more when you add in the drink program), and it's definitely not going to be the type of experience where you'll feel like you need to be rolled out of the restaurant from eating too much.  The plate sizing is delicate and meant to give you a solid few bites which focuses on quality and not quantity.

Californios calls themselves \"Mexican fine dining\" but I found the food to be more Californian with Mexican influences. There's two tasting menus (meat or vegetarian) for $57 pp and wine pairings are an additional $35 (I received 4 pours). There's an 18% service charge that's shared among the entire staff. \n\nSimilar to omakase, the chef (formerly Sons & Daughters) and his sous chefs prepare a series of gorgeous dishes using the best seasonal ingredients available. The portions are small but it's not any different than the portions I've had at Saison, Manresa, and Atelier Crenn; and their tasting menus are $185-$298+.

Of course there were a few missteps (the granitas) but they're still testing things out so that's to be expected. \n\nThe fancy play on \"chips & salsa\" with a burst of saltiness from the trout roe was lovely start to the tasting menu. Loved the deliciously smoky and meaty mackerel, and the kampachi crudo was amazingly fresh. Loved the plate it was presented on which gave it illusion that the crudo was smoking. \n\nThe chicken soup was the best damn chicken soup I've had. The broth had some serious depth of flavor going on with a pop of sweet tartness from the pomegranate. The sous-vide chicken breast? Incredibly silky and tender. \n\nMr. NSS and I are lengua whores. The lengua mole was deliciously satisfying and oh so tender. Don't knock it until you've tried it because lengua is one of most underrated cuts. \n\nThe only thing I didn't care for were the intermezzo granitas. Maybe because of the cold weather?\n\nThe blood orange ice cream and chocolate mousse was decadent yet light. And, my eyes glistened when I heard the \"F\" word. The forbidden fruit in ice cream form savory sweet goodness in a scoop. Mr. NSS' know how much I love the \"F\" word and gave me his share. \n\nBoth the crumbly Mexican cookies with a drizzle of dulce de leche (instead of powdered sugar), and the sweet heat from the chili mango gelee were addictive.\n\nMy only suggestion is to add a bread course as a filler.

Perhaps a little too pretentious but certainly very refined.  The way they serve the food is also beautiful but totally over the top.  We had different types of dishes and utensils with every course.  Golden spoons, tiny wooden spoons, two-pronged forks, vintage marble chargers, tiny tea plates with gilded skulls. It's not BAD, it's just so silly!  We were all giggling over the ridiculously specific utensils.  I don't know if all that is necessary - it takes the focus off of the food in a sort of unwelcomed way.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and funky.  The main dining room has an open kitchen and is decorated sort of in a fancy, masculine 80's throw back sort of way.  The bathroom is totally trippy with changing color neon lights.

Place is pretty small but also was pretty packed especially given that this is their first week being open! The place definitely gives off an interesting vibe. It's got a dark/romantic/intimate atmosphere with interesting RNB/rap songs playing in the background. I love it. So Mission. It's also very much in line with this new affordable fine dining SF scene (i.e. this place reminded me of The Palace--great food, small place, though this place is definitely more aesthetically pleasing)\n\nIt's fine dining in the sense that the food is so top notch, but service sometimes feels a little awkward and not super natural yet--I'm sure it'll get better as the waitresses get more comfortable. My friend and I didn't order any alcohol and our waitress expressed some very noticeable disapproval/sadness which was a little awkward lol.\n\nI'll let my photos speak for themselves, but here's a brief rundown of the dishes we had:\n\nChips--yummy crisp sweet tangy tortilla chips that went super well with the fish roe on top! truly a burst of citrusy goodness\n\nHielo--huckleberry & lemon lime ice with pop rocks!! such a fun dish\n\nCrudo--basically tasted like Japanese sashimi but better. the jalapeno added a nice pop of flavor, the base of the dish was also tangy and citrusy. I enjoyed it! Super fresh fish\n\nGrano--my friend's favorite and I loved as well .whole grain chicken soup! chicken was a little dry and flavorless but the soup was yum yum with pomegranate seeds!\n\nBistec--YES. My favorite. my god it was amazing . The lengua mole was so soft and tender. Came with a caramelized onion that went really well with a citrusy avocado thick sauce\n\nChoc--blood orange ice cream with chocolate and coffee flavored stuff; pretty good\n\nFoie--foie gras ice cream with apple pieces and crumble--felt like a deconstructed apple pie. The ice cream was really good but honestly if you lied and told me it was caramel ice cream I would have believed it\n\nDulce--Mexican wedding cookie was super soft and yummy & the mango gummy was an excellent end!\n\nAt $57/person, I think this place is a huge bargain. They do automatically tack in the 18% service tax into your bill so be aware of that when you're paying. I'm not typically a fan of Mexican food, but this didn't even feel like Mexican food. Honestly such a phenomenal experience. Each dish was beautifully created and so, so creative. It's been a long time since I've had such an exciting, interesting meal. I left feeling full enough, though I could see how someone might still be hungry since the only entree is the beef tongue. \n\ntldr; super cheap tasting menu why wouldn't you go? get in before they get big! service could be better but food at the price is amazing.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-01-08"}, {"excerpts": ["For food:\n\nChips and salsa - reminiscent of a fried corn puff with fish roe and fermented chili sauce\n\nLime granita with homemade pop rocks (which I spilled all over)\n\nSmoked kampachi with fish sauce, chopped cilantro stalks, radish and chili \n\nChicken soup of reduced chicken broth mixed with faro starch water mixed with more chicken broth; tender piece of chicken cooked sous vide, pomegranate, pickled turnip/radish with chilis\n\nGrilled beef tongue (lengua) in mole sauce, avocado pur\u00e9e and grilled onion\n\nMeringue, chocolate creme de pot, and blood orange sorbet\n\nFoie gras salted ice cream, crumbled tortillas \n\nMexican wedding cookies \n\n", "The chicken soup, grilled lengua, and foie gras ice cream were my favorite.

However, I continued to be stumped by what we were eating. Each of the different chefs or servers who brought our food talked so fast, and when I asked if I could get some sort of menu at the end so I knew about all the cool stuff I was eating, I was informed I would. Then, as you may have seen in other posts, you get an highly stylized \"menu\" with one-word descriptions of each course. That is NOT what I wanted. I wanted to know WHAT was in the fish course and the sauce for the duck, etc. That left me pretty disappointed.\n\nThat being said, I'll try to piece together the courses from my memory and others' posts:\n\nCourse 1: tortilla chips with fish eggs and maybe some spicy sauce (a little dot on the edge of the chip)?\nCourse 2: oysters in a half shell\nCourse 3: Celery granita with kiwi pudding (palate cleanser) and pop rocks!\nCourse 4: some type of fish crudo with chili oil (excellent - one of my favorites)\nCourse 5: chicken soup with pomegranate. The chicken had an interesting, almost steak-y texture. Perhaps sous vide? I loved the rich broth.\nCourse 6: three potatoes - something pureed, something in a chip form and one other variant. \nCourse 7: Duck breast with shiso sauce, fennel and served with \"sour\" tortillas and some type of butter/spread. Very good.\nCourse 8: I'm a little hazy on this, but some type of ice cream I believe, with a goat cheese/goat milk? foam. Delicious.\nCourse 9: Foie gras ice cream with hazelnut crumble and caramelized banana.

We walked in expecting a couple of bumps along the road (seeing how it had 'just' opened) but we ended up receiving a whole lot more. You can consider this kind of eating \"elevated\" Mexican-influenced California food. My mind kept oscillating between, \"gee this tastes better than my grandma's....\" and \"damn this is good....no, wait...this is brilliant!\"\n\nThe plating is beautiful. The portions are spot-on. And the flavors/ingredients are masterfully put together to give you something to think about.\n\nOur table immediately noticed the effect of food contrast throughout the meal. It started off light, colorful and zingy. Then turned darker, earthier and rich. Our pairing of a Barcelonian Beer maintained it's versatility and relevance throughout most of the courses; it was so tasty we ordered a second bottle.\n\nIn addition to great ambience, music, service...I found the menu to be surprisingly delightful. No, really. The actual menu you get to take home to brag (I mean, share) with your friends is quite the treat. Like I said, folks. Put on your best foodie-cap. This place is worth several visits. :)\n\nOf particular interest for our pre-fixe was the chicken soup and \"os\". The chicken soup is not simple and requires a bit of navigation with the spoon. Reckless slurping of this dish will result in missing out on some of the wonderful hidden gems within (eg. the pomegranates, citrus \"caviar\" and umami-rich broth). Please, take your time with this dish. \n\nThe last dish I want to commend is the \"os\". I have no idea what this is actually, or what it means or even the impetus behind it. Avocados! California! Right?!. Imagine a grilled avocado, topped with farro, which is topped with pan-roasted mushrooms (oyster & morel) and garnished with very crispy, slightly charred rice puffs.

Agua Fresca with basil, jicama, cucumber, celery, fennel. Light and refreshing, not particularly sweet \n2. Squid ink tostada: one of the memorable dishes from last time.  With saut\u00e9ed Monterey squid, serranos, and house made guacamole\n3. Sope: a black bean and chickpea fritter topped with smoked cotija, trout roe, and watermelon radish \n4. Sterling white sturgeon caviar on super sweet scallop crudo (marinated in a chile citrus broth)\n5. Sorbet: refreshing and citrusy. It was made of mandarin orange and jicama, topped with chia seeds, pea sprouts, and jicama slices \n6. Yerba buena fruit cup: a traditional chili pepper-lime juice-lemon juice marinade over local greens, fruits, and vegetables \n7. Frijoles: three types of beans including cranberry beans and white beans. The textures and flavors were so rich and hearty you can't believe it's vegetarian. I don't even like beans, but this was my favorite dish \n8. Green onion and cilantro sourdough: house made, with Strauss butter \n9. Lobster soup: caldo with lobster, Chinese celery (a thinner, more flavorful type), and Mexican cucumber \n10. Menudo: Amazing! Hen of the wood mushrooms and piccini mushrooms, goat cheese, and *drumroll...\" fried tripe. This makes tripe so much more appealing\n11. Grilled sword fish: seared on one side, served with a ginger habanero sauce, fried leeks, acorn squash, and habaneros\n12. Squab broth: with chipotle pepper and huckleberries - super fragrant.
