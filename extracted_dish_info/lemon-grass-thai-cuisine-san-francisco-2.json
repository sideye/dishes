REAL Thai food, not Chinese-like Thai food.  Daughter, from Japan, however, agreed that this restaurant was sub-par.\n\nWe had been recommended this restaurant by a Fisherman's Wharf-hotel concierge with 35 years experience.  We were happy with the decor and the waitresses's outfits, both which looked relatively authentic.  So we were optimistic.  We should have, however, been afraid when we asked for 1 star on one of the dishes and the waitress looked really puzzled and said that they don't serve the food spicy.\n\nWe started out with the Appetizer Combination.  This was pretty good, actually.  And nicely presented.  However, it was more for two, not for three or more.\n\nWe then shared some Tom Kha chicken.  Not bad.  But almost raw mushrooms.  And no other vegetables.  Just chicken and mushrooms.\n\nThen, our main dishes.  Phad Thai with absolutely no veggies whatsoever!  And no spiciness, which is how daughter had ordered it.  But the Phad See Ew beef was absolutely not spicy even though we'd asked for 2 stars.  Hubby needed hot sauce.  It wasn't bad, but just wasn't up to the level of phad see ew in the Seattle area.  My beef with vegetables dish was not only super salty (or, I suspect, had MSG), but the large amount of Chinese greens in it (which I'd never seen ever before in Thai dishes) were uncut and, even after chewing on it for awhile, almost choked on it.  In any case, this was definitely NOT Thai food; it was Chinese food attempting to be Thai.  (While not so bad as the Almond Fried Chicken days of Spokane, in comparison, it seemed so.)\n\nTo top it all off, the service was also rather lackluster.  No one advised my dish did not come with rice (which I don't even believe was Jasmine) nor suggest that it be ordered. Nor did the waitress ask what type meat for the phad Thai.  And, besides, we waited for what seemed to be an eternity to order.\n\nThe saving grace was the fried banana with ice cream.  While it couldn't compare to Mt. Vernon's Thai House, it was still tasty.  Lots of ice cream, which I like.  And a big enough portion to feed 3.\n\nI can only assume that the cuisine has gone downhill since voted Best in the Bay in 2010.\n\nBottom line: unless you're only wanting dessert, try some other restaurant (assuming a good one exists).", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-09-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The fried banana with ice cream was a perfect way to end the meal."], "author": "Melissa T.", "review": "A great find in the Russian Hill district!

We walked in and found ourselves in the middle of the dining room. I'm glad we didn't wind up sitting by the door.\n\nWe were seated quickly and offered menus. Between what was on the menu and an accompanying sheet of specials, there was far too much to choose from.  The waitress came to take our order. I asked about several items including Chicken Tom Yum Noodles. She assured me I would prefer the Nuer Yang over the noodles. Hmmm. How could she know what I would like (or not like)? I ordered the Nuer Yang and the chicken Larb. \n\nThe Larb soon arrived. The order was large. My daughter being a vegetarian did not partake. (She ordered the Basil Crispy tofu, sauted with limejuice, chili,green and red bell peppers and basil; served with rice.) The Larb was tasty and I finished the order. For my entree I had the Nuer Yang (broiled top sirloin beef, sliced and served with lime juice). The beef was a bit overcooked and felt as if it had been prepared earlier and kept to serve. My daughter enjoyed her Tofu but there was far too much for her to finish.\n\nThe food? Good to fair with portions being at least generous to gigantic. Make the portions a bit smaller with a bit more attention to quality. It could be that if I had ordered from the specials menu it would have been fresher/better. The service was quick but perfunctory. The ambiance was strip-mall commodity Thai. There's nothing compelling that would have me return with so many other options. \n\n2.5 stars.", "rating": 2, "date": "2007-11-26"}]}
