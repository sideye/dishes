I dream of that. \n\nThings that were mediocre: the persimmon toast thing (rather bland), the kimchi pork pierogi (couldn't taste the kimchi at all and the porky was not very juicy). The warm apple cake was decent but was probably the strong point of their not-very-great dessert menu.\n\nThe only big issue that came up for us was that our server was super pushy, and encouraged us (party of 2) to add another 2 small plates to our order. We weren't convinced as we were not that hungry, so we pushed back and said we didn't think we needed it. He continued being aggressive about it so we just agreed and chose some dishes randomly (the persimmon toast and pierogi).\n\nWe ended up with more food than we needed, and the dishes we didn't like as much were the ones we were pushed to order randomly!!

I just had to wait a couple of months for the hype to die down a little bit.  Surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult to land a reservation here than for State Bird.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's a much more grander scale than State Bird.  The decor is warm and looks a lot brighter.  Plus they have two upper balconies for dining.  The big difference with The Progress is that they have a full cocktail bar here with tables so you can dine at the bar as well.\n\nThe food menu is completely different and can hold it's own against State Bird.  Where State Bird is more of a dim sum and tapas style restaurant, the Progress has a more family style dining approach with a 6-course dinner.  While the experience is still similar, the food portions here are larger.  I dined here with a couple friends so sharing each dish between the three of us was pretty easy to do.  The only thing that did take a while was for us to decide which 6 dishes to pick for our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nComplimentary \"Banchan\" --  http://bit.ly/1FnBuQb \n\nRaw Japanese Snapper with Turnips & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche -- http://bit.ly/1HVWSJL \n\nSmoked Duck with Marinated Pioppini Mushrooms & Dried Plum --  http://bit.ly/1yZ5FFK\n\nShaved Cauliflower-herbs & Pig Fries --  http://bit.ly/1yZ6zC7\n\nAromatic Spiced Squab with Salted Chili Paste -- http://bit.ly/1HW03kN \n\nLamb Merguez with Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus & Crispy Squid --  http://bit.ly/1HW1iAu\n\nDessert Assortment --  http://bit.ly/1DNhNkO\ndessert choose 1 per person\nlemongrass floating island, rhubarb sorbet & coconut-ginger gel\u00e9e\npoppyseed angel cake, strawberries, sicilian pistachio & mascarpone\ndates \u00e0 la mode, St. George NOLA, hazelnuts & chocolate\n\nSo much food!  And we enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered.  My faves were definitely the Smoked Duck which was similar to the duck I had back at State Bird minus the pancakes, the Pig Fries because of their sheer fried pork awesomeness,  and surprisingly, the Lamb Merguez with Octopus and Squid, simply because I'm not into lamb that much.  But somehow they found a way to bring that dish all together and the Lamb Merguez didn't have an overpowering lamb taste.  The dessert assortment, while good, was a little bit of a let down in comparison to State Bird's dessert offerings.  I might end up skipping dessert next time since it's optional.\n\nJust recently, they changed the food menu at the bar.  Though it's still a la carte, the portions are more tapas sized like State Bird and at more affordable prices.  So basically, you can get a \"State Bird\" experience at the bar.\n\nIs The Progress better than State Bird?  It's pretty close,  Food-wise they're almost equally impressive, but I still prefer the whole \"dim sum\" experience at State Bird to be more entertaining.   Nonetheless, The Progress is an amazing follow up from the State Bird Provisions team and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again to try their other dishes, just like I would with State Bird.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["For our meal we chose:\n\n*smoked duck with marinated yellowfoot mushrooms & dried plum\n*shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries\n*pecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk\n"], "author": "Mai W.", "review": "This place was a great dining experience.

Therefore, I went to The Progress with high expectations but an open mind, knowing the concept would be different.\n\nDRINKS:\nWe got drinks while waiting for our table to be ready. This was the highlight of the night. AWESOME cocktails. I got the The Mezzanine (mezcal, house banana liqueur, allspice, lime, nocino). Being on a mezcal kick from Mexico a week earlier, I thoroughly enjoyed this smokey concoction. I also tried the King's Crossing (rye, calvados, mulling spice, lemon, egg white, cider). Woah, tasted like delicious spiked apple cider. During dinner, I enjoyed a chardonnay and prie blanc. They had a short, but varied wine by the glass selection. Impressive bottle selection.\n\nFOOD:\nAmuse Bouche - beef jerky, fried oyster, something with trout I believe, and cheese crackers. Great presentation and strong flavors.

Soggy and the truffle was barely detectable. \n\nTreasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles, pumpkin-rice dumpling in pork broth - My favorite dish of the meal. Delicious broth, loved the sausage and pumpkin dumplings. Trout quenelles was so-so.\n\nDungeness crab, bok choi, tofu stir fry - Ick. Barely any crab, tofu was bland and had an off putting taste.

Lacked cohesiveness.\n\nThe meal wasn't a total flop, but it was disappointing and left me unsatisfied. The food sounded great on the menu but all lacked one thing or another in the execution.\n\nOther notes:\n-Good service in both the bar area and at dinner.

Whereas SBP is the dim sum service of haute cuisine, The Progress is the banquet counterpart where courses are served family-style for each table.\n\nService was superb. They were attentive to refilling your water, and checking on you throughout the meal. Moreover, the waiters were quite knowledgable about the menu and are able to describe the dishes to you, with detail and opinion. The only downside of the service, at least considering the amount you were paying, was that they do not exchange the dishware often enough between \"courses.\" Although we had at a reservation at 7:30, we were not seated until past 8pm. So, be prepared to wait, even with a reservation. \n\nUnlike SBP, The Progress has a full liquor license, which means cocktails, beer, extensive wine list and a standing bar that opens at 5pm. After a glance, my friend and I decided to go with The Concession (popcorn infused rum, Coca Cola syrup with Vermouth as its base). It was smooth, lingering on the tongue and rich on the taste buds. I loved it.

Keep in mind that you are paying for about $20 per plate, rounding out to about $100pp with a drink or dessert.\n\n1) Shaved romanesco, herbs and pig (ear) fries: very interesting. The pig ears tasted like they were pickled and then deep fried. The combination of salty, briny, fried pig ears paired well with the shaved romanesco and herbs. \n2) Yuzu and olive oil marinated raw tuna with green daikon: This was delicious. The tuna was fresh. However, I wished they did something with the raw daikon and carrots so that they would embody more flavor and pair better. Overall the tuna was good but the other components were lost in this dish. \n3) Curry rabbit & chicken karaage: interesting. It took us a little bit to figure out whether we were eating rabbit or chicken. The chicken and rabbit karaage were placed over a layer of shredded carrots and saut\u00e9ed black trumpet mushrooms. Overall, the trumpet mushrooms and rabbit were my favorite parts of this dish. The mushrooms were earthy and cooked down to a silky perfection. The rabbit was well cooked, tender and carried a light hint of curry. The chicken was dry, lackluster and left much more to be desired. \n4) Treasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles and pumpkin rice dumpling in a creamy pork broth: my favorite of the 6, mostly because each component was interesting and executed well. I've never had fermented sausage, which tasted almost like the kimchi in the soup. The trout quenelle's had the texture of Chinese fish balls but was much more flavorful. The pumpkin rice dumpling was soft, bouncy and extremely interesting. However, each person only gets one dumpling, which was barely the size of a quarter. The broth was light in taste but rich in texture. \n5) Lamb merquez with yellow eye beans, octopus and crispy squid: this one was good too. Possibly the 2nd contender. The lamb merquez was oversalted and chewy. Despite being the star of the dish, it tasted like slim jims. That said, I especially enjoyed the rest of the dish. The octopus was tender with a hint of smokiness from the grill. The squid was deep fried and the yellow eye beans were buttery and sweet. Overall, this dish came together well, except for the lamb merquez, which got lost in this dish.\n6) Dungeness crab, bok choy and tofu stir fry: it was good but not $20 good. The flavors reminded me a dashi-flavored stir fry agedashi tofu. The dungeness lump crab meat added flavor and luxurious touch to the dish, but that was about it; it was simply mixed in. \n\nMain dishes aside, I really enjoyed the \"banchan plate\" which came with 4 different bite-size banchan. Meager in portion, but very adventurous in interpretation and concept. My favorite was the fancy cheese-it cracker and malaysian style beef jerky.\n\nI appreciate the concept that State Bird Provisions upholds. Unfortunately, The Progress fell short of my expections. I enjoyed it the first time, but probably won't return.The beautiful ambiance couldn't make-up for the price per dish and the quality of it. Each dish recreated asian-fusion flavors, but in the end, the components were not executed as well as I wished.

The last few times I was here around 5:15 week nights, I got in. \n\n    The 90-seat dining room with a few more tables on the second level, usually fill up by 6 PM, and it's jam packed every night just like its sister State Bird Provisions next door. \n\n    The Progress serves bar menu and full dinner menu at the bar, so it's such a great option for diner like me CANNOT get any reservation from both restaurants :-) It's not a complain, in fact it makes me more excited and a little adrenaline rush with the thought that I couldn't get any seat even at the bar, haha.

It got the 5 spice flavor, the meat was so tender, delicious, I forgot when was the last time the squab could taste that good.\n\n- grilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce - this was the only dish that wasn't my style :-) but my friends love it! I prefer my beef/steak with less sauce on it. \n\n    The cocktail list is also good. I presonally enjoyed the Paloma (reposado tequila, pomelo, lime, sugar, madras curry tincture) recommended by our server Kelly.\n\n  The wine list was delicious by Sommerlier Jason Alexander, if you are a wine lover, collector, or a somm, you would enjoy this list tremendously.

Chill music is playing in the background, we are immediately greeted and taken to our table, the servers are dressed in casual attire (ie: jeans and flannel), and the ambiance was super cool. For a meal of this caliber, you would think it'd be somewhat pretentious with people walking around in suit and ties- it wasn't.\n\nFrom start to finish, our entire 2 hr experience was very laid back & professional at the same time. It was perfect.\n\nOh, and did I forget to mention that it's FUN!!

Basically, it got you excited for everything else to come.\n\nShortly after, our plates came out one by one (and since their menu changes all the time, I won't bore you guys with every detail in every single dish).\n\nThe first 4 dishes below are the ones that really, really blew my mind:\n\n+ First, we had the spiced lamb tartare with various \"mix-in\" condiments. The condiments included sprouts, sesame seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, egg yolk bottarga, bronze fennel fronds, pickled kohlrabi strips and green onions. They served it with crunchy/salty black rice crackers.\n\nUhm, how on earth do they make these black rice crackers? Anyone??!!?!?!!\n\n+ Next, was the shaved cauliflower herbs & pig fries. If this is still on the menu, it's MUST GET. It was the perfect balance between flavors and textures- crispy, salty, crunchy and spicy. The herbs tasted like they were just pulled from the garden hours before.\n\n+ Third, we had the pecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk.\n\nWhen it came to the table, everyone just looked at each other like, 'THAT'S IT?'\n\nBut from the very first bite to the last, we couldn't have enough of it. In fact, I'm still raving about it today to my friends: \"GUYS, I JUST HAD THE BEST ROTI EVER!\" (real life).\n\nSo even the simplest sounding menu item, was one of the biggest surprises. It was executed very well, and the truffle buttermilk was orgasmic. You gotta get it.\n\n+ OMG. This squab. I didn't even know what squab was until now. Every bite was tender with juicy flavors that can't be described. The closest thing I can think of is the quail at Cockscomb but this is even BETTER.\n\nThe feet on the legs were a little freaky. Just ignore it.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nThis is a place where you get to experience some of the best culinary dishes that SF has to offer, without breaking the bank.\n\nAt The Progress, you know you will be getting an amazing meal & dining experience without sitting through a boring, pretentious 3 hour Michelin meal.\n\nChefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski has been changing the game since they opened State Bird Provisions, offering small tapas in a dim sum cart format. For those of you who don't know, it's one of the most highly talked about restaurants EVER. And they've won a ton of awards... no big deal.\n\nSo. You can see why The Progress has been the talk of the town since they opened. And trust me, they definitely live up to the hype.\n\nGot any special occasions, bdays or anniversaries coming up?\n\nBecause if I were you, I'd totally make a ressie ASAP (before it becomes impossible).

The condiments included sprouts, green onion, a nut of some sort, peppers, and more. They served it with a crunchy and salty blue sesame chip.\n\nSecond we had the smoked duck with pioppini mushrooms and dried plum. The duck left a magnificent smokey/sweet flavor in your mouth that was so tasty.\n\nAround the same time she delivered our shaved cauliflower and pig fries. This provided a crispy and salty compliment to the smokey/sweet duck.\n\nAfter our appetizer plates, we had two more coming.\n\nAnother waiter brought us our Treasure chest soup and described the ingredients. He was pretty humble when he described the dish, but he didn't need to be because it was a treasure. The pumpkin-rice dumpling was just sweet enough to mix well with the pork broth. The sausages were complex and a little overpowering at times, but unique. \n\nLast we had guinea hen and pork polpette. This dish was good, but unfortunately it just couldn't compare to the four previous plates.\n\nQuite full, we still had dessert. I had the milk chocolate-black lager ice cream with cocoa sable and caraway seed. It was sweet, chocolaty, crunchy, and just the right size.\n\nThe inside of The Progress is a wonderful view filled with crafted wooden tables and chairs. My one complaint is that it gets a bit noisy. Perhaps something on the walls could dampen the sound.\n\nThe Progress was wonderful.

I just had to wait a couple of months for the hype to die down a little bit.  Surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult to land a reservation here than for State Bird.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's a much more grander scale than State Bird.  The decor is warm and looks a lot brighter.  Plus they have two upper balconies for dining.  The big difference with The Progress is that they have a full cocktail bar here with tables so you can dine at the bar as well.\n\nThe food menu is completely different and can hold it's own against State Bird.  Where State Bird is more of a dim sum and tapas style restaurant, the Progress has a more family style dining approach with a 6-course dinner.  While the experience is still similar, the food portions here are larger.  I dined here with a couple friends so sharing each dish between the three of us was pretty easy to do.  The only thing that did take a while was for us to decide which 6 dishes to pick for our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nComplimentary \"Banchan\" --  http://bit.ly/1FnBuQb \n\nRaw Japanese Snapper with Turnips & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche -- http://bit.ly/1HVWSJL \n\nSmoked Duck with Marinated Pioppini Mushrooms & Dried Plum --  http://bit.ly/1yZ5FFK\n\nShaved Cauliflower-herbs & Pig Fries --  http://bit.ly/1yZ6zC7\n\nAromatic Spiced Squab with Salted Chili Paste -- http://bit.ly/1HW03kN \n\nLamb Merguez with Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus & Crispy Squid --  http://bit.ly/1HW1iAu\n\nDessert Assortment --  http://bit.ly/1DNhNkO\ndessert choose 1 per person\nlemongrass floating island, rhubarb sorbet & coconut-ginger gel\u00e9e\npoppyseed angel cake, strawberries, sicilian pistachio & mascarpone\ndates \u00e0 la mode, St. George NOLA, hazelnuts & chocolate\n\nSo much food!  And we enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered.  My faves were definitely the Smoked Duck which was similar to the duck I had back at State Bird minus the pancakes, the Pig Fries because of their sheer fried pork awesomeness,  and surprisingly, the Lamb Merguez with Octopus and Squid, simply because I'm not into lamb that much.  But somehow they found a way to bring that dish all together and the Lamb Merguez didn't have an overpowering lamb taste.  The dessert assortment, while good, was a little bit of a let down in comparison to State Bird's dessert offerings.  I might end up skipping dessert next time since it's optional.\n\nJust recently, they changed the food menu at the bar.  Though it's still a la carte, the portions are more tapas sized like State Bird and at more affordable prices.  So basically, you can get a \"State Bird\" experience at the bar.\n\nIs The Progress better than State Bird?  It's pretty close,  Food-wise they're almost equally impressive, but I still prefer the whole \"dim sum\" experience at State Bird to be more entertaining.   Nonetheless, The Progress is an amazing follow up from the State Bird Provisions team and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again to try their other dishes, just like I would with State Bird.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["There was only my squid allergy, but she forgot to mention that the crackers that came with the Raw japanese snapper were squid ink.

It got the 5 spice flavor, the meat was so tender, delicious, I forgot when was the last time the squab could taste that good.\n\n- grilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce - this was the only dish that wasn't my style :-) but my friends love it! I prefer my beef/steak with less sauce on it. \n\n    The cocktail list is also good. I presonally enjoyed the Paloma (reposado tequila, pomelo, lime, sugar, madras curry tincture) recommended by our server Kelly.\n\n  The wine list was delicious by Sommerlier Jason Alexander, if you are a wine lover, collector, or a somm, you would enjoy this list tremendously.

A large bar area with more than 20 seats, so without reservation, it's not a bad thing. The last few times I was here around 5:15 week nights, I got in. \n\n    The 90-seat dining room with a few more tables on the second level, usually fill up by 6 PM, and it's jam packed every night just like its sister State Bird Provisions next door. \n\n    The Progress serves bar menu and full dinner menu at the bar, so it's such a great option for diner like me CANNOT get any reservation from both restaurants :-) It's not a complain, in fact it makes me more excited and a little adrenaline rush with the thought that I couldn't get any seat even at the bar, haha. That was how I feel about last night dinner with my best friend in town. \n\n   Luckily chef Stuart Brioza was in, what a treat for my best friend and my visiting somm friend from NYC. \n\n   Love the concept of 6 dishes for $65 per person, and each additional dish for $10, plenty of delicious food to share, reasonable price point, great concept and execution. \n\n- spot prawn - was so delicious\n\n- shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries\n\n- spiced lamb tartare - I had this dish 3 times now, and loving it each time more.\n\n- raw japanese snapper - beautifully presented as good as it looks.\n\n- porcini & mt. tam dumpling with nettle salsa verde - newest dish in APR 2015, refreshing.\n\n- pecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk - a MUST TRY\n\n- roasted mushrooms & kale with local wakame kraut - I had this dish 3 times and will continue order it as long as it's on the menu, a great choice for vegetarian.\n\n- butter clams on the half shell with kimchi piccata & shungiku\n\n- Spanish  barnacles - it was so delicious and I came back last night, it was gone!  \n\n- black butter butternut squash with caramelized onion & swiss chard\n\n- polpette of guinea hen & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - another FAV dish of mine. \n\n- lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus & crispy squid - my 3rd time with this dish, highly recommend \n\n- maitake, tofu curry & bok choy 'stir fry' with smoked black cod ponzu - reminds me of Chinese cuisine.\n\n- aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - reminds me of a Vietnamese dish that I had when I was growing up. It got the 5 spice flavor, the meat was so tender, delicious, I forgot when was the last time the squab could taste that good.\n\n- grilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce - this was the only dish that wasn't my style :-) but my friends love it! I prefer my beef/steak with less sauce on it. \n\n    The cocktail list is also good. I presonally enjoyed the Paloma (reposado tequila, pomelo, lime, sugar, madras curry tincture) recommended by our server Kelly.\n\n  The wine list was delicious by Sommerlier Jason Alexander, if you are a wine lover, collector, or a somm, you would enjoy this list tremendously. He offers wines of the world, beautiful white Burgundy, the grower Champagnes, Rieslings, and plenty of French, Italian and Spanish red for under $70 bottles! And if you are a collector, check out the Cellar Selection, I'm in love! \n\n    The service by Eric last time at the dining room was excellent. The last 2 times at the bar was equally fantastic, attentive, caring, and purely enjoyable for us. \n\n    I'm looking forward to my next visit to explore the ever evolving menu daily and the wine list to pair with it. \n\n    Again, congratulations The Progress, San Francisco for being Jame Beards Foundation Award Semifinalists 2015, and I'm sure many accolades to come. \n\nNOTE: no valet parking, come at 5 PM on week night, you will surely get in at the bar!", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-04-03"}], "grilled sicilian artichokes": [{"excerpts": ["Then, a dish of grilled Sicilian artichokes with quinoa and shaved pig's head was yet another creative combination of savory meats with succulent greens.\n\n"], "author": "Vincent L.", "review": "I had the pleasure of dining at The Progress with a great group of folks.

At least I got a good buzz from the drinks.\n\nSo what happened? Well, I'm a big fan of State Bird (I may be biased, as it was also the location of the best first date ever). Therefore, I went to The Progress with high expectations but an open mind, knowing the concept would be different.\n\nDRINKS:\nWe got drinks while waiting for our table to be ready. This was the highlight of the night. AWESOME cocktails. I got the The Mezzanine (mezcal, house banana liqueur, allspice, lime, nocino). Being on a mezcal kick from Mexico a week earlier, I thoroughly enjoyed this smokey concoction. I also tried the King's Crossing (rye, calvados, mulling spice, lemon, egg white, cider). Woah, tasted like delicious spiked apple cider. During dinner, I enjoyed a chardonnay and prie blanc. They had a short, but varied wine by the glass selection. Impressive bottle selection.\n\nFOOD:\nAmuse Bouche - beef jerky, fried oyster, something with trout I believe, and cheese crackers. Great presentation and strong flavors. Off to a great start!\n\nSmoked duck w/ marinated yellowfoot mushrooms & dried plum - I insisted on ordering this, as I love the duck pancakes at State Bird. Unfortunately this was very disappointing. I have to agree with the reviewer that said this tasted like bologna. I couldn't finish it.\n\nPorcini & mt. tam dumpling w/ nettle salsa verde - Not bad, enjoyed the cheese filling, but too much dough to filling ratio.\n\nPercorino roti w/ black truffle buttermilk - How do you mess up roti? Soggy and the truffle was barely detectable. \n\nTreasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles, pumpkin-rice dumpling in pork broth - My favorite dish of the meal. Delicious broth, loved the sausage and pumpkin dumplings. Trout quenelles was so-so.\n\nDungeness crab, bok choi, tofu stir fry - Ick. Barely any crab, tofu was bland and had an off putting taste. And I like tofu! - plain, fried, stinky, dried...but not this tofu.\n\nWild mushrooms w/ pickled local nori & kale - Bland. Lacked cohesiveness.\n\nThe meal wasn't a total flop, but it was disappointing and left me unsatisfied. The food sounded great on the menu but all lacked one thing or another in the execution.\n\nOther notes:\n-Good service in both the bar area and at dinner. Enthusiastic, helpful, and great all around.\n-They serve the full menu a la carte at the bar.\n-We had our own two top, but some tables were communal style.\n-Very beautiful, well-designed space.

State Bird is great but sometimes you get tired of the routine; it got a little bit repetitive and a hungry foodie always wants more. Thank god the Progress opened!  The concept is you pick 6 dishes from the menu (about 20 total items) and share family style, for $65/person. If you want to add dishes, they are an additional $10/person. Corkage is $25.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is very cool. The bar has a metal frame hanging from the ceiling holding various plants. The restaurant as a whole is very long, and feels like you're on a train from the curved ceilings and curved walls. There are a lot of new wooden and modern panelings which are beautiful. There are two upstairs parts of the restaurant, on each end. In the center, it's a bunch of open space which creates a nice center and buzz of excitement. \n\nThe bartenders are attentive and quick, and thus we got our drinks with swift speed. I got the Sunny Jim ($11, gin, lemon, vanilla-pineapple syrup, kaffir lime leaf, soda, with curry-dusted pineapple), which tasted like a lemonade with vanilla and cream in it, quite tasty and different from any other drink I've had before.  My bf ordered the Concession ($11, rum, house cherry cola syrup, licorice bitters, with buttered popcorn) - he loved it, but for me it was too bitter of a drink (a \"guy\" drink).\n\nOur waiter, Gerald, was an extremely friendly, hilarious gay guy whom everyone would love to have as their BFF. He kept joking around with our table, and others too, and made my bf and I feel very at home. It was great! I hope you get him as your waiter. The chef, Stuart Brioza, was there putting the final touches on the dishes and also bringing some dishes to each table. He presented some of ours very happily, and with lots of pride; you could tell that his heart and soul went into this restaurant. Very cool!\n\nIt turns out the food is very much Asian Fusion, which took me by surprise. We ordered 6.5 dishes. My favorites were #1, 3, 4 and 5:\n\n1) Shaved cauliflower herbs and pig fries. This dish had a sour taste from the lime, and with the herbs and cauliflower, and savoriness of the fried meat, which made it taste like a Thai dish. The pig ears (don't be afraid like I was!) were not in an ear shaped like I had imagined, but instead little strips fried and oozing with fat drippings. Your loss if you don't order this one!\n\n2) Barely Poached Ridgebacks with yuzu & olio nuovo. Ridgebacks are Ebi, very similar to the dish you can sometimes order at Japanese restaurants where they fry the head, and the body of the shrimp. The head was fried, which was quite tasty. The body was poached, and very soft and the texture was amazing. However we felt this dish could have been ordered at another restaurant, not exactly the most innovative (not to say it was bad either though!)\n\n3) Sunchoke, Rosemary, and Pecorino Roti - the WINNER of the night. Roti is a style of Indian Crepe, if you've never had. It's flaky and doughy at the same time. You just rip it off, and it went terrifically with the pecorino cheese. Oh, my god! All of the other tables were ordering it too. \n\n4) Smoked black cod fried rice with squid & preserved lemon. Quite tasty. The black cod seemed like it was poached (vs. fried like I had envisioned) but that was great too, it just made the dish softer. The squid was fried, which gave the dish a nice contrast and complimented nicely with the pucker from the lemon.\n\n5) Treasure Chest of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu and pumpkin-rice dumplings in a creamy pork broth. Basically a ramen soup with lots of little trinkets. I would say this dish was creative due to the fish quenelles and fermented sausage in the soup. What kind of soup ever includes those ingredients?! They were so delicious though! Quenelles were my fav since it was so soft - like biting into a fish cream puff. \n\n6) Aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - the \"China\" dish of the night. I wasn't too crazy about this one, but the squab was cooked well (medium rare) and thus soft and chewy. It also came with lettuce wraps and the chili paste - one of which was extremely bitter, which is probably why I didn't care for this dish much. It also wasn't the most creative. \n\n7) Honey cocoa ice cream & olio nuovo. Honey cocoa ice cream was extremely buttery, creamy and chocolatey in a smooth and tasty way. However that was the highlight of the dish. I wouldn't order desserts again; stick to the main savory dishes!\n\nCan't wait to return.

The pig fries had a healthy heaping of pig ear. I don't think I would order this again. \n\nSpiced lamb tartare with various mix-in condiments. This was probably my favorite dish.

In fact, the two are physically, right next door. Whereas SBP is the dim sum service of haute cuisine, The Progress is the banquet counterpart where courses are served family-style for each table.\n\nService was superb. They were attentive to refilling your water, and checking on you throughout the meal. Moreover, the waiters were quite knowledgable about the menu and are able to describe the dishes to you, with detail and opinion. The only downside of the service, at least considering the amount you were paying, was that they do not exchange the dishware often enough between \"courses.\" Although we had at a reservation at 7:30, we were not seated until past 8pm. So, be prepared to wait, even with a reservation. \n\nUnlike SBP, The Progress has a full liquor license, which means cocktails, beer, extensive wine list and a standing bar that opens at 5pm. After a glance, my friend and I decided to go with The Concession (popcorn infused rum, Coca Cola syrup with Vermouth as its base). It was smooth, lingering on the tongue and rich on the taste buds. I loved it. In fact, I would come back just to explore their cocktail menu. \n\nTheir menu is composed of 12 dishes that seem to change, with the exception of some popular dishes like \"pig fries\" and \"smoked duck.\" Although, don't quote me on this because it has only opened for a month or so. Each person at your table is charged at a starting price of $65, with the entire table having the option of choosing 6 dishes. The courses are portioned to match the number of people at your table, which in our case was 4. Keep in mind that you are paying for about $20 per plate, rounding out to about $100pp with a drink or dessert.\n\n1) Shaved romanesco, herbs and pig (ear) fries: very interesting. The pig ears tasted like they were pickled and then deep fried. The combination of salty, briny, fried pig ears paired well with the shaved romanesco and herbs. \n2) Yuzu and olive oil marinated raw tuna with green daikon: This was delicious. The tuna was fresh. However, I wished they did something with the raw daikon and carrots so that they would embody more flavor and pair better. Overall the tuna was good but the other components were lost in this dish. \n3) Curry rabbit & chicken karaage: interesting. It took us a little bit to figure out whether we were eating rabbit or chicken. The chicken and rabbit karaage were placed over a layer of shredded carrots and saut\u00e9ed black trumpet mushrooms. Overall, the trumpet mushrooms and rabbit were my favorite parts of this dish. The mushrooms were earthy and cooked down to a silky perfection. The rabbit was well cooked, tender and carried a light hint of curry. The chicken was dry, lackluster and left much more to be desired. \n4) Treasure chest of fermented sausage, trout quenelles and pumpkin rice dumpling in a creamy pork broth: my favorite of the 6, mostly because each component was interesting and executed well. I've never had fermented sausage, which tasted almost like the kimchi in the soup. The trout quenelle's had the texture of Chinese fish balls but was much more flavorful. The pumpkin rice dumpling was soft, bouncy and extremely interesting. However, each person only gets one dumpling, which was barely the size of a quarter. The broth was light in taste but rich in texture. \n5) Lamb merquez with yellow eye beans, octopus and crispy squid: this one was good too. Possibly the 2nd contender. The lamb merquez was oversalted and chewy. Despite being the star of the dish, it tasted like slim jims. That said, I especially enjoyed the rest of the dish. The octopus was tender with a hint of smokiness from the grill. The squid was deep fried and the yellow eye beans were buttery and sweet. Overall, this dish came together well, except for the lamb merquez, which got lost in this dish.\n6) Dungeness crab, bok choy and tofu stir fry: it was good but not $20 good. The flavors reminded me a dashi-flavored stir fry agedashi tofu. The dungeness lump crab meat added flavor and luxurious touch to the dish, but that was about it; it was simply mixed in. \n\nMain dishes aside, I really enjoyed the \"banchan plate\" which came with 4 different bite-size banchan. Meager in portion, but very adventurous in interpretation and concept. My favorite was the fancy cheese-it cracker and malaysian style beef jerky.\n\nI appreciate the concept that State Bird Provisions upholds. Unfortunately, The Progress fell short of my expections. I enjoyed it the first time, but probably won't return.The beautiful ambiance couldn't make-up for the price per dish and the quality of it. Each dish recreated asian-fusion flavors, but in the end, the components were not executed as well as I wished. Moreover the construction and fusions of each dish felt disorganized and could have been more thought out.

You get a menu and can choose six of whatever the hell you want.  It's kind of a marriage of Gary Danko with the old Yun Luck Rice Shoppe in New York City.  \n\nThe restaurant has great music, mood, and energy.  And the food is very good at worst and inspired at best.  One more thing, Stuart Brioza and his wife know what it means to be a host/chef/owner.

Where State Bird is more of a dim sum and tapas style restaurant, the Progress has a more family style dining approach with a 6-course dinner.  While the experience is still similar, the food portions here are larger.  I dined here with a couple friends so sharing each dish between the three of us was pretty easy to do.  The only thing that did take a while was for us to decide which 6 dishes to pick for our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nComplimentary \"Banchan\" --  http://bit.ly/1FnBuQb \n\nRaw Japanese Snapper with Turnips & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche -- http://bit.ly/1HVWSJL \n\nSmoked Duck with Marinated Pioppini Mushrooms & Dried Plum --  http://bit.ly/1yZ5FFK\n\nShaved Cauliflower-herbs & Pig Fries --  http://bit.ly/1yZ6zC7\n\nAromatic Spiced Squab with Salted Chili Paste -- http://bit.ly/1HW03kN \n\nLamb Merguez with Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus & Crispy Squid --  http://bit.ly/1HW1iAu\n\nDessert Assortment --  http://bit.ly/1DNhNkO\ndessert choose 1 per person\nlemongrass floating island, rhubarb sorbet & coconut-ginger gel\u00e9e\npoppyseed angel cake, strawberries, sicilian pistachio & mascarpone\ndates \u00e0 la mode, St. George NOLA, hazelnuts & chocolate\n\nSo much food!  And we enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered.  My faves were definitely the Smoked Duck which was similar to the duck I had back at State Bird minus the pancakes, the Pig Fries because of their sheer fried pork awesomeness,  and surprisingly, the Lamb Merguez with Octopus and Squid, simply because I'm not into lamb that much.  But somehow they found a way to bring that dish all together and the Lamb Merguez didn't have an overpowering lamb taste.  The dessert assortment, while good, was a little bit of a let down in comparison to State Bird's dessert offerings.  I might end up skipping dessert next time since it's optional.\n\nJust recently, they changed the food menu at the bar.  Though it's still a la carte, the portions are more tapas sized like State Bird and at more affordable prices.  So basically, you can get a \"State Bird\" experience at the bar.\n\nIs The Progress better than State Bird?  It's pretty close,  Food-wise they're almost equally impressive, but I still prefer the whole \"dim sum\" experience at State Bird to be more entertaining.   Nonetheless, The Progress is an amazing follow up from the State Bird Provisions team and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again to try their other dishes, just like I would with State Bird.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["We got raw halibut, ricotta, pig fry, roti, cod and lamb merguez.

The other yummy dish was the lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus and crispy squid, which was soooo heavenly. Everything on this dish was seasoned well.

It was yummier than the octopus, which was already waking up my taste buds from the NOT-SO-YUMMY dishes! \n\nHowever, the 2nd all the way to the 5th dish was not up to par to the expectations I had of this place. The dishes were:\n\n1) Pig fries -- go to your local Chinese butcher shop. They will sell you more tastier pig ears for less than $5! \n\n2) Black rice fried butter clams-kimchi 'picatta' -- WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THIS?!

Emphasis on the wannabe and American parts. Tip to the chefs: you should reallyyyyy make the food the way it is supposed to taste. As a Vietnamese girl who cooks authentic Vietnamese food and comes from four generations of chefs, I suggest using the smelly fish sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, shrimp/crab paste... etc...

When we arrived, we checked our backpacks into their complementary coat check.  The hostess notified us that our table wasn't ready yet, but I found out why, later.  So, we waited around for about 25 minutes until we were seated upstairs.  The restaurant space definitely opens much larger than what the entrance way initially revealed.\n\nTheir drink menu had many flavorful beer options.  To be honest, I was a little skeptical of the six-course family-style menu, particularly, with its sufficiency.  I went to the gym earlier, so I was carrying a voracious appetite, and I've been burned too many times before, leaving somewhere hungry after blowing through plate after plate of $15 \"tapas.\" But this was not the case here-- at the end of the meal, I was thoroughly stuffed.  Let's go to the tape!  (disclaimer: I can't remember what they called each of their dishes, but I'll try to describe what we selected as best as I can)\n\nBanchan\n1st:  Asparagus with Mascarpone\n2nd: Mushrooms & Kale\n3rd: Treasure Chest a/k/a sausage in a \"6-hour\" tonkatsu\n4th: Lamb Merguez\n5th: Lobster & Bok Choy\n6th: Spiced Squab Lettuce Wraps\n\nEvery dish had an interesting ethnic influence. The highlights were 1) the asparagus, which started off our meal with a blast of sweet and savory freshness, 2) the mushroom-kale, packed with flavor and fiber, and 3) the lobster, cooked to juicy perfection.  The lamb merguez was just okay, and the treasure chest didn't quite work for me.  The tanginess of the sausage and the creamy tonkatsu was a strange combination.\n\nWe ended up finishing our meal somewhere close to 11:00pm.  Each course came out at a leisurely pace, giving us ample time to dissect and digest each complex creation.  Thankfully, I had nothing important to do the next morning, so this wasn't a problem for me.  I would definitely suggest allotting about two hours when eating here.\n\nOverall, The Progress was a very enjoyable dining experience.

I just had to wait a couple of months for the hype to die down a little bit.  Surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult to land a reservation here than for State Bird.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's a much more grander scale than State Bird.  The decor is warm and looks a lot brighter.  Plus they have two upper balconies for dining.  The big difference with The Progress is that they have a full cocktail bar here with tables so you can dine at the bar as well.\n\nThe food menu is completely different and can hold it's own against State Bird.  Where State Bird is more of a dim sum and tapas style restaurant, the Progress has a more family style dining approach with a 6-course dinner.  While the experience is still similar, the food portions here are larger.  I dined here with a couple friends so sharing each dish between the three of us was pretty easy to do.  The only thing that did take a while was for us to decide which 6 dishes to pick for our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nComplimentary \"Banchan\" --  http://bit.ly/1FnBuQb \n\nRaw Japanese Snapper with Turnips & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche -- http://bit.ly/1HVWSJL \n\nSmoked Duck with Marinated Pioppini Mushrooms & Dried Plum --  http://bit.ly/1yZ5FFK\n\nShaved Cauliflower-herbs & Pig Fries --  http://bit.ly/1yZ6zC7\n\nAromatic Spiced Squab with Salted Chili Paste -- http://bit.ly/1HW03kN \n\nLamb Merguez with Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus & Crispy Squid --  http://bit.ly/1HW1iAu\n\nDessert Assortment --  http://bit.ly/1DNhNkO\ndessert choose 1 per person\nlemongrass floating island, rhubarb sorbet & coconut-ginger gel\u00e9e\npoppyseed angel cake, strawberries, sicilian pistachio & mascarpone\ndates \u00e0 la mode, St. George NOLA, hazelnuts & chocolate\n\nSo much food!  And we enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered.  My faves were definitely the Smoked Duck which was similar to the duck I had back at State Bird minus the pancakes, the Pig Fries because of their sheer fried pork awesomeness,  and surprisingly, the Lamb Merguez with Octopus and Squid, simply because I'm not into lamb that much.  But somehow they found a way to bring that dish all together and the Lamb Merguez didn't have an overpowering lamb taste.  The dessert assortment, while good, was a little bit of a let down in comparison to State Bird's dessert offerings.  I might end up skipping dessert next time since it's optional.\n\nJust recently, they changed the food menu at the bar.  Though it's still a la carte, the portions are more tapas sized like State Bird and at more affordable prices.  So basically, you can get a \"State Bird\" experience at the bar.\n\nIs The Progress better than State Bird?  It's pretty close,  Food-wise they're almost equally impressive, but I still prefer the whole \"dim sum\" experience at State Bird to be more entertaining.

Make sure to eat this while it's still hot! We weren't too fond of the Crab Cavatelli as the tomato sauce overpowered the crab meat. Didn't like the green beans that were mixed in either.\n\nA must order, the Black Cod Fried Rice was aromatic and complex both in flavor and texture from the tempura calamari. Another must order is the squab, it was nicely spiced and uber tender. The salted chili paste reminded me of gochujang but much, much better. While the lamb was also perfectly tender, it could have used a sauce to tie everything together. My least favorite was the BN Beef which was a tad chewy. The mustard-miso oyster sauce sounded great on paper but I found it a bit funky tasting.\n\nAt this point, we needed to lay our muffin tops onto a flatbed to roll out of the restaurant but luckily dessert was refreshing and light.  A genius exotic combo, the persimmon sorbet and meringue-like floating island and candied buddha's hand was perfect for someone like me who doesn't care for sugary sweets but craves a little something sweet to end a multi-course dinner.\n\nOh and I can't forget about the cocktails.

"], "author": "Jocelyn L.", "review": "The Progress is State Bird Provision's newest addition to the Fillmore! State Bird is great but sometimes you get tired of the routine; it got a little bit repetitive and a hungry foodie always wants more. Thank god the Progress opened!  The concept is you pick 6 dishes from the menu (about 20 total items) and share family style, for $65/person. If you want to add dishes, they are an additional $10/person. Corkage is $25.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is very cool. The bar has a metal frame hanging from the ceiling holding various plants. The restaurant as a whole is very long, and feels like you're on a train from the curved ceilings and curved walls. There are a lot of new wooden and modern panelings which are beautiful. There are two upstairs parts of the restaurant, on each end. In the center, it's a bunch of open space which creates a nice center and buzz of excitement. \n\nThe bartenders are attentive and quick, and thus we got our drinks with swift speed. I got the Sunny Jim ($11, gin, lemon, vanilla-pineapple syrup, kaffir lime leaf, soda, with curry-dusted pineapple), which tasted like a lemonade with vanilla and cream in it, quite tasty and different from any other drink I've had before.  My bf ordered the Concession ($11, rum, house cherry cola syrup, licorice bitters, with buttered popcorn) - he loved it, but for me it was too bitter of a drink (a \"guy\" drink).\n\nOur waiter, Gerald, was an extremely friendly, hilarious gay guy whom everyone would love to have as their BFF. He kept joking around with our table, and others too, and made my bf and I feel very at home. It was great! I hope you get him as your waiter. The chef, Stuart Brioza, was there putting the final touches on the dishes and also bringing some dishes to each table. He presented some of ours very happily, and with lots of pride; you could tell that his heart and soul went into this restaurant. Very cool!\n\nIt turns out the food is very much Asian Fusion, which took me by surprise. We ordered 6.5 dishes. My favorites were #1, 3, 4 and 5:\n\n1) Shaved cauliflower herbs and pig fries. This dish had a sour taste from the lime, and with the herbs and cauliflower, and savoriness of the fried meat, which made it taste like a Thai dish. The pig ears (don't be afraid like I was!) were not in an ear shaped like I had imagined, but instead little strips fried and oozing with fat drippings. Your loss if you don't order this one!\n\n2) Barely Poached Ridgebacks with yuzu & olio nuovo. Ridgebacks are Ebi, very similar to the dish you can sometimes order at Japanese restaurants where they fry the head, and the body of the shrimp. The head was fried, which was quite tasty. The body was poached, and very soft and the texture was amazing. However we felt this dish could have been ordered at another restaurant, not exactly the most innovative (not to say it was bad either though!)\n\n3) Sunchoke, Rosemary, and Pecorino Roti - the WINNER of the night. Roti is a style of Indian Crepe, if you've never had. It's flaky and doughy at the same time. You just rip it off, and it went terrifically with the pecorino cheese. Oh, my god! All of the other tables were ordering it too. \n\n4) Smoked black cod fried rice with squid & preserved lemon. Quite tasty. The black cod seemed like it was poached (vs. fried like I had envisioned) but that was great too, it just made the dish softer. The squid was fried, which gave the dish a nice contrast and complimented nicely with the pucker from the lemon.\n\n5) Treasure Chest of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu and pumpkin-rice dumplings in a creamy pork broth. Basically a ramen soup with lots of little trinkets. I would say this dish was creative due to the fish quenelles and fermented sausage in the soup. What kind of soup ever includes those ingredients?! They were so delicious though! Quenelles were my fav since it was so soft - like biting into a fish cream puff. \n\n6) Aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - the \"China\" dish of the night. I wasn't too crazy about this one, but the squab was cooked well (medium rare) and thus soft and chewy. It also came with lettuce wraps and the chili paste - one of which was extremely bitter, which is probably why I didn't care for this dish much. It also wasn't the most creative. \n\n7) Honey cocoa ice cream & olio nuovo. Honey cocoa ice cream was extremely buttery, creamy and chocolatey in a smooth and tasty way. However that was the highlight of the dish. I wouldn't order desserts again; stick to the main savory dishes!\n\nCan't wait to return.

A large bar area with more than 20 seats, so without reservation, it's not a bad thing. The last few times I was here around 5:15 week nights, I got in. \n\n    The 90-seat dining room with a few more tables on the second level, usually fill up by 6 PM, and it's jam packed every night just like its sister State Bird Provisions next door. \n\n    The Progress serves bar menu and full dinner menu at the bar, so it's such a great option for diner like me CANNOT get any reservation from both restaurants :-) It's not a complain, in fact it makes me more excited and a little adrenaline rush with the thought that I couldn't get any seat even at the bar, haha.

I prefer my beef/steak with less sauce on it. \n\n    The cocktail list is also good. I presonally enjoyed the Paloma (reposado tequila, pomelo, lime, sugar, madras curry tincture) recommended by our server Kelly.\n\n  The wine list was delicious by Sommerlier Jason Alexander, if you are a wine lover, collector, or a somm, you would enjoy this list tremendously. He offers wines of the world, beautiful white Burgundy, the grower Champagnes, Rieslings, and plenty of French, Italian and Spanish red for under $70 bottles!

So, you settled for the not as pined over but nice younger brother.  Okay, I don't double dip or even attempt to double dip amongst family or good friends, but I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this right?  So, I've always wanted to try older brother (or sister) restaurant, State Bird Provisions, but I've tried all the tips that my friends have given me in order to make a reservation and no luck.  I swear SBP is harder to get into than Stanford!  At first it seemed hard to get a reservation at The Progress as well, but about three weeks prior I was actually able to get a reservation for President's Day Monday at a reasonable time (6PM).  We both had the day off so I grabbed it.  \n\nThe door for both restaurants don't seem to be clearly marked.  We arrived a couple minutes early and were seated right away.  The restaurant already had a good amount of patrons.  We ended up sharing a communal style table which is for two parties of two, with a seat in between both on each side.  I honestly wasn't expecting much from The Progress due to a slew of mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.\n6 dishes for $65 per person..all parties must agree on the dishes as they are shared.\n\nA plate full of different amouse bouches were served: a chicken jerky, cheddar cracker, squab mousse, a fontina cheese dumpling and one more that we forgot.  Overall, they were really good bite size starters.  Two of my favorites were the squab mousse and fontina cheese dumpling.  \n\nOur 6 dishes:\n*Crab, bok choy, and tofu stir fry - Wonderful start to our meal.  Lots of bits of crab meat and we loved the tofu pillows, all in a light ginger sauce.  \n*Polpette of rabbit & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - Never had rabbit, the pork and rabbit were so flavorful and tender.  The blood orange was a nice acidic and sweet compliment to the meat.  Our favorite dish!  \n*Grilled Five Dot Ranch beef w/mustard-miso oyster sauce - Like Cherylynn said, this was our least favorite dish.  Although it wasn't horrible, we were expecting more.  There were only four pieces of beef, and they weren't tender at all.\n*Black butter butternut squash w/caramelized onions & swiss chard - I gots to have my veggies!  The sweetness from the butternut squash and caramelized onions worked well with the bitterness of the swiss chard.  The butter tied in the savoriness.  \n*Shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries - I've had Taiwanese pig ear before and hated it, but we thought why not, let's try this, especially since it's fried.  These ears were done right!  The texture was so not like the other pig ear I've had (no cartilage weirdness here), there were also lots of pork belly strips, some acidity and fish sauce to cut the fattiness and the shaved cauliflower was a nice touch as well.  \n*Aromatic spiced squab w/salted chili paste - Crispy skin and wonderful spices and the chili paste was hot!  But there was very little meat on this, which made it a bummer.\n\nLike others said, we were still a little hungry, so yes, we went to that wonderful place further down Geary for a supplement (Jack In The Box).

It was just a very unique flavor and it's hard to describe, it tastes aged but in the good way like a dry-aged steak tastes. It tasted very meaty and unctuous which I personally really like. Also that broth? Omg it rivals any good ramen broth I've ever had. You could taste the hours and hours of the pork that simmered away to make it. Only thing was that I wish there had been more pumpkin mochi. We only had one piece each and it was so delicious I wanted more haha.\n\nAlso the pecorino roti with the black truffle buttermilk sauce?

I made my way out to The Progress with the BF and a friend visiting from LA (with whom I also went to SBP my first time!). We aren't the type to make reservations, so we pressed our luck by going early to wait in line for one of the few tables left open for walk-ins.\n\nThe BF and I arrived first at 4:30p; no one was in line yet, but the SBP queue had already gathered. Here's the deal: if you don't have a reservation, you can get there early to wait in line and try to snag one of the seated tables. There's also an option to eat in the bar, but the tables are small and best for 2 people max; I even saw some people standing to eat at the bar -- whatever works. \n\nThey open doors @ 5p for both resos and walk ins, with the option of hanging out by the bar to grab some drinks. For walk-ins, first seating is at 5:30p so we hung out for a bit. Cocktail prices are reasonable, with the usual selection of gin/rhum/bourbon/mezcal/tequila style drinks. Our table took awhile and I had to check in with the host again (who seemed a bit stressed), but we were eventually seated closer to 6p.\n\nThe dining style and cuisine focus is quite different from SBP -- less tapas/dim sum and more family style portions with a huge emphasis on Asian flavors. The table has to decide on 6 dishes to fit within the $65/person, but if you want to add additional dishes, it's an extra $10/person per dish. After you decide which 6 plates you want, the chef and staff will portion out the dishes depending on the size of the group. We selected the following:\n\n+ Amuse bouche of smoked lap xuong, fermented goat cheese and pickled radish, broccoli tempura, and toasted seaweed with a salmon/mustard seed topping - beautifully plated and great rich flavors to kick start our palates. This really set the tone of the Asian cuisine themed menu.\n+ Shaved cauliflower-herbs and pig fries - one of my favorites of the night; the pig fries were crispy yet chewy at the same time. I could have ordered 2 of these to myself.\n+ Sunchoke, rosemary, & pecorino \"roti\" - we saw someone order this at the bar and knew we had to get it as well. The roti dough was freshly made and presented in a tent like, folded manner with shavings of pecorino on top of it. I didn't care for the specks of rosemary in it, but the sunchoke was a nice break from the rich flavors.\n+ \"Treasure Chest\" of fermented sausage, fish quenelles, tofu & pumpkin rice dumpling in a creamy pork broth - the production of pouring the broth into the soup is part of the experience. Seriously, do not sleep on this. The broth is rich and creamy like a ramen broth, with the tofu fried to a unique consistency that still maintained it's fry even while in the broth. The sourness from the fermented sausage (reminded me of something we ate in CPH) created a well-balanced amalgamation of flavors.\n+ Don Watson's lamb scallopini with fava greens & cippolini - encrusted with sesame seeds, the lamb was cooked well and had a nice crisp due to the sesame seeds. By this time I was getting a bit full, so the smaller portion was fine by me.\n- Smoked black cod fried rice with squid & preserved lemon - I suppose I expected this to be like Mission Chinese Food's salted cod fried rice, and it wasn't. The consistency was more creamy and that's likely due to the rice being recently made; not the day old rice we usually use to make this ;)\n- Aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - we didn't actually order this, so when the chef brought it out we were confused. Our server had made a mistake and as a way to make-good, extended this plate gratis which was extremely courteous. Squab tasted like a mix between quail and lamb with a five-spice like rub; I wasn't over the moon about this dish so it was great that it was free. \n\nDessert: our server gave us the option to order both desserts as 1 dish which was awesome -- he just asked us which one we wanted more of to portion it out accordingly.\n+ Honey cocoa ice cream & olio nuovo w jasmine tea poached fruits, greengage plum jam & ricotta whey - dat honey cocoa ice cream was the richest chocolate ice cream I've ever had and want to keep eating. Mixing the jam and fruits together was also a nice refreshing touch.\n- Triple citrus sorbet & star anise lime caramel w gingered coconut floating island & candied buddha's hand - more neutral on this one, I could have eaten just scoops of the honey cocoa ice cream and been satisfied.\n\nService was impeccable (despite the delay in being seated and the host looking confused when I checked in with her), the ambiance was bright and lively, and the food was spectacular.

A large bar area with more than 20 seats, so without reservation, it's not a bad thing. The last few times I was here around 5:15 week nights, I got in. \n\n    The 90-seat dining room with a few more tables on the second level, usually fill up by 6 PM, and it's jam packed every night just like its sister State Bird Provisions next door. \n\n    The Progress serves bar menu and full dinner menu at the bar, so it's such a great option for diner like me CANNOT get any reservation from both restaurants :-) It's not a complain, in fact it makes me more excited and a little adrenaline rush with the thought that I couldn't get any seat even at the bar, haha. That was how I feel about last night dinner with my best friend in town. \n\n   Luckily chef Stuart Brioza was in, what a treat for my best friend and my visiting somm friend from NYC. \n\n   Love the concept of 6 dishes for $65 per person, and each additional dish for $10, plenty of delicious food to share, reasonable price point, great concept and execution. \n\n- spot prawn - was so delicious\n\n- shaved cauliflower-herbs & pig fries\n\n- spiced lamb tartare - I had this dish 3 times now, and loving it each time more.\n\n- raw japanese snapper - beautifully presented as good as it looks.\n\n- porcini & mt. tam dumpling with nettle salsa verde - newest dish in APR 2015, refreshing.\n\n- pecorino 'roti' with perigord truffle buttermilk - a MUST TRY\n\n- roasted mushrooms & kale with local wakame kraut - I had this dish 3 times and will continue order it as long as it's on the menu, a great choice for vegetarian.\n\n- butter clams on the half shell with kimchi piccata & shungiku\n\n- Spanish  barnacles - it was so delicious and I came back last night, it was gone!  \n\n- black butter butternut squash with caramelized onion & swiss chard\n\n- polpette of guinea hen & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - another FAV dish of mine. \n\n- lamb merguez with yellow eye beans, octopus & crispy squid - my 3rd time with this dish, highly recommend \n\n- maitake, tofu curry & bok choy 'stir fry' with smoked black cod ponzu - reminds me of Chinese cuisine.\n\n- aromatic spiced squab with salted chili paste - reminds me of a Vietnamese dish that I had when I was growing up.

So, I've always wanted to try older brother (or sister) restaurant, State Bird Provisions, but I've tried all the tips that my friends have given me in order to make a reservation and no luck.  I swear SBP is harder to get into than Stanford!  At first it seemed hard to get a reservation at The Progress as well, but about three weeks prior I was actually able to get a reservation for President's Day Monday at a reasonable time (6PM).  We both had the day off so I grabbed it.  \n\nThe door for both restaurants don't seem to be clearly marked.  We arrived a couple minutes early and were seated right away.  The restaurant already had a good amount of patrons.  We ended up sharing a communal style table which is for two parties of two, with a seat in between both on each side.  I honestly wasn't expecting much from The Progress due to a slew of mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.\n6 dishes for $65 per person..all parties must agree on the dishes as they are shared.\n\nA plate full of different amouse bouches were served: a chicken jerky, cheddar cracker, squab mousse, a fontina cheese dumpling and one more that we forgot.  Overall, they were really good bite size starters.  Two of my favorites were the squab mousse and fontina cheese dumpling.  \n\nOur 6 dishes:\n*Crab, bok choy, and tofu stir fry - Wonderful start to our meal.  Lots of bits of crab meat and we loved the tofu pillows, all in a light ginger sauce.  \n*Polpette of rabbit & pork with blood orange & castelvetranos - Never had rabbit, the pork and rabbit were so flavorful and tender.  The blood orange was a nice acidic and sweet compliment to the meat.  Our favorite dish!  \n*Grilled Five Dot Ranch beef w/mustard-miso oyster sauce - Like Cherylynn said, this was our least favorite dish.  Although it wasn't horrible, we were expecting more.  There were only four pieces of beef, and they weren't tender at all.\n*Black butter butternut squash w/caramelized onions & swiss chard - I gots to have my veggies!

The portions were filling without making me feel like I ate way too much.\n\nThe pacing for dishes was a little odd. After starting out perfectly with an appetizer plate and each of the veggies separately, we got the final three plates all at the same time. The portions were a good size, but it made the experience feel a little rushed, like we had to hurry and eat to make sure we got to the food while it was still hot on the plate. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly, got us drinks quickly, and we're a joy to chat with. While we were trying to decide if we should order a seventh dish a la carte, the appetizer dish (which is a nice extra and not part of the dishes you get to choose) came out. That sealed that we should definitely just go with the recommended six plates. Desserts are one per person, so basically everyone gets to choose their own option, but it still counts as one course. \n\nThe appetizer was superb and great way to start the meal. A tender leek, nut-covered jerky, small piece of salmon and cucumber with sauce, a leafy thing with avocado sauce, fried gnocchi, and sliced strawberry with cheese. We both ended up scraping the plate clean with our toothpick utensils. \n\nFor drinks, we got some wine and a Sunny Jim. The Sunny Jim wasn't bad, but the vanilla was way too overpowering. If I didn't know the drink had gin (or any other ingredient), I would've guessed it was just some vanilla soda water.\n\nFor our mains, we ordered:\nShaved cauliflower and pig fries: A great mix, though the crispier pig ears weren't quite as delicious as the thick and meaty fried bits. The cauliflower and abundant greens made me feel a little less guilty about all the fried deliciousness.\n\nWild mushrooms & kale with local wakame kraut: The highlight of the meal for me. Tender kale with mushrooms so succulent it was like eating a steak. \n\nPolpette of pork with blood orange & castelvetranos: I think the castelvetranos referred to the olive sauce under this dish. On their own, the meatballs were a little salty, but they paired well with the potatoes. Adding the blood orange on top gave the entire dish a surprising pop. This needed a little more fruit to help even out the salty meat.\n\nLobster, bok choy, & tofu stir fry: An OK dish, but the lobster and the tofu tasted plain. The real surprise came from the kimchi; a toothsome addition that I wish there was more of throughout. \n\nGrilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce: The mustard sauce was very nice, but the beef tasted very standard. Not quite the high quality that I'd expect for the small portions of meat. \n\nDessert: \n- Elderflower floating island, guava sherbert, & arnold palmer gelee\n- Milk chocolate-black lager ice cream, cocoa sable & caraway seed.\nFortunately, we didn't have to end the meal with so-so steak. I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite from these two amazing desserts. The fruity guava sherbert was a great foil to the rich, chocolatey ice cream sable. The chocolate dish also had a delicious crunchy chocolate surprise as the base, and it tasted like it was sprinkled with homemade Honeycrisp cereal. \n\nSide note: Several people around us ordered the \"Treasure Chest\" a broth covered mix of sausage and dumpling that looked wonderful.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-03-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Grilled Five Dot Ranch beef with mustard-miso oyster sauce"], "author": "Vinitha R.", "review": "Overall, I really enjoyed all of the food.

I just had to wait a couple of months for the hype to die down a little bit.  Surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult to land a reservation here than for State Bird.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's a much more grander scale than State Bird.  The decor is warm and looks a lot brighter.  Plus they have two upper balconies for dining.  The big difference with The Progress is that they have a full cocktail bar here with tables so you can dine at the bar as well.\n\nThe food menu is completely different and can hold it's own against State Bird.  Where State Bird is more of a dim sum and tapas style restaurant, the Progress has a more family style dining approach with a 6-course dinner.  While the experience is still similar, the food portions here are larger.  I dined here with a couple friends so sharing each dish between the three of us was pretty easy to do.  The only thing that did take a while was for us to decide which 6 dishes to pick for our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nComplimentary \"Banchan\" --  http://bit.ly/1FnBuQb \n\nRaw Japanese Snapper with Turnips & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche -- http://bit.ly/1HVWSJL \n\nSmoked Duck with Marinated Pioppini Mushrooms & Dried Plum --  http://bit.ly/1yZ5FFK\n\nShaved Cauliflower-herbs & Pig Fries --  http://bit.ly/1yZ6zC7\n\nAromatic Spiced Squab with Salted Chili Paste -- http://bit.ly/1HW03kN \n\nLamb Merguez with Yellow Eye Beans, Octopus & Crispy Squid --  http://bit.ly/1HW1iAu\n\nDessert Assortment --  http://bit.ly/1DNhNkO\ndessert choose 1 per person\nlemongrass floating island, rhubarb sorbet & coconut-ginger gel\u00e9e\npoppyseed angel cake, strawberries, sicilian pistachio & mascarpone\ndates \u00e0 la mode, St. George NOLA, hazelnuts & chocolate\n\nSo much food!  And we enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered.  My faves were definitely the Smoked Duck which was similar to the duck I had back at State Bird minus the pancakes, the Pig Fries because of their sheer fried pork awesomeness,  and surprisingly, the Lamb Merguez with Octopus and Squid, simply because I'm not into lamb that much.  But somehow they found a way to bring that dish all together and the Lamb Merguez didn't have an overpowering lamb taste.  The dessert assortment, while good, was a little bit of a let down in comparison to State Bird's dessert offerings.  I might end up skipping dessert next time since it's optional.\n\nJust recently, they changed the food menu at the bar.  Though it's still a la carte, the portions are more tapas sized like State Bird and at more affordable prices.  So basically, you can get a \"State Bird\" experience at the bar.\n\nIs The Progress better than State Bird?  It's pretty close,  Food-wise they're almost equally impressive, but I still prefer the whole \"dim sum\" experience at State Bird to be more entertaining.   Nonetheless, The Progress is an amazing follow up from the State Bird Provisions team and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again to try their other dishes, just like I would with State Bird.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The lemongrass floating island was worth it--the sorbet and cream blending to be surprisingly light. \n\n"], "author": "Laura S.", "review": "Playful and inventive, but also fussy and salty.  While especially the simplest dishes showed off inventive style, there were many moments where family style didn't feel like the best medium.  I'm a compulsive sharer--at Gary Danko, the server brought us an extra plate because we were eating each other's dishes--but the added steps: assembling the 4 ingredient squab, selecting which lamb mix-ins we wanted, pouring the pork broth over the tumble of plain-looking \"treasures\" and especially having to divide each dish into 4 portions, felt like the next version of making guacamole tableside: a gimmick that sidelined dinner in favor of the show.\n\nAnd while some of the dishes were fantastic, some over-favored fermenting and many were stingingly salty.  The Chef's gifts were roasted mushrooms in crisp housemade furikake, tempura mussels with too much black pepper, jerky with peanuts that tasted a lot like kalbi, housemade ham on a cracker, radishes with butter, but the unexpected stand out was the oranges with curry oil--a weirdly rich, refreshing bite.\n\nLamb Tartare--I loved the black rice cracker, but the pickled kohlrabi overpowered the other mix-ins. After picking it out, I could better taste the fresh meat. Perhaps I could have asked our server to hold them, but if my fiance doesn't like fennel, and the other couple have their own preferences, and we're eating out of the same dish; well, you get the picture.\n\nRoti came out burning hot and crisp. Like the oranges, the uninspiring description belied a winning dish. I would have gladly eaten the whole serving smeared with the tart, homemade ricotta.\n\nTreasure Chest was the first salt bomb.  The pork broth was rich, but needed the surprisingly mild trout quenelles (think rubbery matzo ball) to tame its saltiness.  The mochi balls were gritty instead of chewy and smooth. The fermented sausage was new for me--strong sausage with a sour punch like sauerkraut--but it didn't necessarily go with the broth.\n\nThe Morels, recommended by one of our innumerable servers, were blindly salty. Couldn't enjoy the custardy egg yolks, or the tender mushrooms, it was all salt.\n\nPolpette was not my choice but I'm so glad we got it--the creamy smoked potatoes made the dish.\n\nSpiced Squab was served as a lettuce wrap and the dark meat was richer than I'd anticipated. The wings were dried out, tough instead of crispy, and overseasoned. The right amount of rub was better applied to the meatier breast.  \n\nWe opted for 6 courses + 2 desserts. I should have listened to fellow yelpers: the poppyseed cake was moist, but utterly boring with stewed strawberries. The lemongrass floating island was worth it--the sorbet and cream blending to be surprisingly light. \n\nThe 4 of us were seated at a booth on 3 sides of a table--the 4th side was too close to our neighbors for anyone to sit there, so the two of us at the heads of the table weren't within arms distance of the center of the table, making family style even more challenging.  But maybe I'd forgive that because of the bathrooms. Possibly the greatest bathrooms ever. Not only did they have the \"vacant/occupied\" deadbolt--a must for single stall, unisex bathroom--but extra toilet paper was wrapped in festive giftwrap tissue and the walls and floors were pink glitter, as if a bouncy ball had exploded inside.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-04-12"}], "rhubarb sorbet  coconutginger gele poppyseed angel cake": [], "strawberries sicilian pistachio  mascarpone": [], "datesla mode": [], "st george nola": [], "hazelnuts  chocolate": []}
