I ordered a Chicken Shish Kabab wrap.  I should have read the menu b/c it says, clearly stated that it had tahini sauce in it.

Telling me that I'd already eaten it doesn't make up for the fact that you may have poisoned me.  Never again.\n\n\n*******************************\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd give Taboun 3.5 stars.  But life's not perfect and Yelp doesn't give me the option of 3.5 stars.  So I'm giving Taboun 3 stars today, with the hopes that my next meal at Taboun won't be as disappointing as my last. \n\nIn Taboun's defense, I have always ordered the vegetarian combo plate and have been mostly happy with it: large portions of (usually) fresh cucumber salad, along with hummus & baba ghanoush & plenty of pita bread -- (mostly) good food, and enough to share.\n\nSo that made my most recent meal at Taboun that much more disappointing.  I decided to be adventurous and try something different: the falafel deluxe wrap, \"plated.\"  I understood my order to mean (1) deluxe = some of that yummy grilled eggplant sitting on the counter along with \"potatoes,\" and (2) 2 yummy side dishes and some pita bread.  I was sorely disappointed.  Although the falafel itself was fine, it was pretty cold, temperature-wise.  My kid loved it, though, and it was coated in tahini, so I figured that was fine.  But there were way too many raw onions inside the wrap.  Also, there was maybe just a piece or two of that tasty-looking eggplant and instead of \"potatoes,\" there were two mediocre french fries in my wrap.  I'm sorry, but if your menu HAS \"good ol' fashioned [french] fries\" on it, why would you say that you're adding \"potatoes\" when, in fact, you're really just adding two soggy french fries?  Seems like false advertising to me.  Besides, my two yummy side dishes turned out to be weak in comparison with the veggie plate: if I order a side of french fries, could you spare more than, say, six or eight?  That seemed kind of cheap.  The two dolmas were tasty, but the single piece of dry pita bread, cut into quarters, was missing something -- say, tahini?  And while you're at it, could you at least offer me some ketchup for my six or eight fries?\n\nI'll probably go back to Taboun, if only because (1) this place is in our neighborhood and is near my kid's favorite park, (2) for $18, my spouse, toddler and I were full after our shared meal, and (3) the food is fast -- which is ideal for a family on the go.  But when we do go back to Taboun, I will never stray from the veggie plate again!
