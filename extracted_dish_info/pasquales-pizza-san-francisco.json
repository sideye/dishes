"], "author": "David A.", "review": "Wow! Pasquale's on Sloat has been going down hill for decades but have now really hit rock bottom! Absolutely disgusting nearly inedible swirl/slop at this point! I have been dining and ordering from various Pasquale's my entire 48 year life and have been frequenting Pasquale's with my family since before I can even remember, but there is a huge difference between the two remaining restaurants, the main one on Irving and this dive spot on Sloat. \n\nI recently had a birthday and turned 48 and it was the first birthday in my life when I didn't at least meet up with family or friends on my special day, so feeling pretty bummed out that I had absolutely no plans for lunch, brunch or dinner on my actual birthday, decided to treat myself to some comfort food by myself. Called in to order a small two topping pizza for pickup; I save about 5 or 6 bucks on delivery fee and tip by driving about a mile away so I opted to call in my order and pick it up; to which I was told \"20 minutes.\" \n\nI showed up exactly 20 minutes later and my pizza wasn't ready. Big mistake on their behalf, because it gave me time to just stand there, look around and realize just how dirty, rundown and grimy this shack is. I never noticed how poor the integrity of the tiny building that looks like it could be brought down by one pass of a bulldozer is. pacing around for 10 minutes waiting for my pizza and looking around at nothing to really look at, what immediately stood out to me is that there were flies EVERYWHERE!!! The ingredients were uncovered and the two guys there didn't give half a crap. They were flying around the air and crawling over food behind  the counter; just gross! The place just looked gross and made me wonder about other times I had ordered from here and felt sick in the past. \n\nThe two guys working that night looked like they were somewhere between 18 and 20 and had no clue of how to make pizza! Making good pizza is actually an art with a science to it and requires some degree of taught skill. kneading the dough, tossing the dough, adding the right amount of olive oil, distributing the ingredients and cooking and toasting the pizza is all part of the process of making a good pizza. These guys just throw everything on the thick dough with no thought or skill to it at all, cook your pizza and put it in a b ox. It also smelled bad in the restaurant while I waited for ten minutes and on the way home the pizza actually smelled bad and I dreaded eating it, instead of when I used to bring a pizza from Pasquale's home, smelling the tempting aroma from the olive oil and other ingredients, just disgusted me. I almost wanted to throw it out, but I never waste money and hoped that it would taste good. .. Nope! tasted awful as well and just put the finishing insult to injury on one of my worst birthdays to date. \n\nI have never written or talked about this and this was long before Yelp and it's most likely under different management and staff but 25-30 years ago, I ordered a pizza from Sloat; clearly asked for a medium pizza with salami on the whole pizza and mushrooms on half of it and got a cheese pizza with mushrooms on one half which just didn't do it for me. I called to complain and the scuzbag who answered the phone said \"I can give you back a dollar for one ingredient; I should have argued to make me a whole new pizza or reimburse me for half but was young and just said \"well okay I guess\" the guy I had tipped a dollar; that's how much you tipped back then, showed up to my door looking like he wanted to rip my head off! and handed me a dollar! I know that the loser cook or manager told the kid that I wanted my tip back! That never sat well with me as not only did the cook on the phone screw up my order and ruined my pizza and then only offered a dollar back, but also told the poor delivery boy to drive way out of his way because I wanted my tip back! What a POS that guy was, back then. \n\nAnyway, I will never under any circumstances ever come back or order from Pasquale's on Sloat again. Pasquale's on Irving has also declined a bit but is a million times better than the one on Sloat.

", "taste the tomato in the sause.. ", "I mean seriously good authentic pizza here. "], "author": "Joel D.", "review": "This review is STRICTLY based on the fact that I have never ate in the actual restaurant itself , I only order delivery from this place- and for PIZZA who the heck doesn't ?? So it makes sense.\n\nBasically Pizza and Chinese food are the two foods you will never see me in the restaurant for... this is why they deliver. If I eat out and dine IN a restuarant I eat non deliverable food -- OBVIOUSLY -- and so should you. lol\n\nSo, Pasquale's is my second favorite Pizza place in San Francisco bra none ! (Milano's on 9th being my absolute favorite) -\n\nPasquale's on SLOAT pizza is very flavorful and ingrediants just POP in your mouth. The kind of flavor for pizza I am talking about is where you can actually taste the spices in the pepperoni, and actually taste the fennel in the sausage.... taste the tomato in the sause.. I mean seriously good authentic pizza here. Delivery is reasonable, and \nprice is great for what you get.\n\nThe combination is really packed. The pesto is real, the meats are just awesome, and the veggies are fresh and real. Not no frozen taste here. Real size cuts of the veggies so you know they don't have that \"cookie cutter\" frozen food size to them.\n\nReally a great pizza no matter what you order. The crust is perfect. Just chewy enough with out being to doughy, and just crispy enough for that real brick oven baked taste. The cheese is perfect, and perfect amounts of it as well. The pizza has that real \"rolled on flour\" taste on it. Unlike other places that are starting to use corn meal to roll the crust out on... When a pizza is really rolled out on a floured cutting board then hand tossed, you can tell.\n\nAnd for my patented \"Is It A Get Laid At The End Of The Night Place\" review --------- Well,,, its delivery, so you probably JUST got laid before you ordered it !!. So honestly it is NOT one of those places.\n\nBut, all in all, the pizza is very impressive and you should try it. Highly recommended by me.\n\nDisclaimer - I am only talking about the one on Sloat. I am not speaking of the other 2 in the city. As they are good too, I feel this one just has a better taste to it.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-02-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Yes the place does look kind of dumpy but it always has appeared clean and all the ingredients are fresh and their sausage is very good, i'm getting hungry just thinking about it ."], "author": "Biggwally K.", "review": "i've been coming here for years mainly for pickup.
