Make sure to get it \"for here\" since they give you more sides.  \n\nThe plate had a good amount of sauce and you can get it spicy for a dollar more.  Every table has Sriracha sauce on it, so that works too. The meat was tender and salmon cooked well, given that it is fast-food.  \n\nThe cashier was very friendly and they definitely focus on customer service.  If you don't like something about your order, make sure to let them know and they will fix it without any questions.  \n\nOverall, \"a fancy Flame Broiler\" type of concept.

My brother just moved around the corner, so this has become a pretty convenient place to stop by. Pretty much everything stands from my review of the Fillmore location regarding the quality of the food and the service.\n\n\"I grew up on Seattle-teriyaki, which is typically made with very poor quality/cheap ingredients.  Glaze has upped the standards, using quality meat, produce and housemade salad dressings.  They also offer more options than a standard Seattle teriyaki restaurant (3 dressings to choose from, various types of gyoza, etc.).  I always order the same thing. Chicken + Gyoza combo, so I really cannot go into depth on the menu. \n\nI've never been let down by Glaze, everything has tasted great, the chicken well cooked and juicy! The gyoza, crispy and delightful! The sauces are also quite a treat!  I rotate between the salad dressings.. they are all equally fantastic, though I do wish that they offered \"Seattle dressing,\" that sweet, delicious and mysterious dressing that you find at every teriyaki restaurant in Seattle. \"\n\nAlso, note that Domenic is still the man! Even if he has moved locations, his friendly demeanor is always appreciated. \n\nBiggest disappointment here is the beverage situation.  I wish the Chestnut location would take note from Fillmore and offer Manny's Ale and Jones Soda on tap.  Those two things alone make it worth the climb up to the Fillmore location. Also.. secret Seattle dressing! This should be an option, or perhaps a secret menu item for those who know... pleaaaase make this happen! \n\nAll in all, I will always support Glaze Teriyaki.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-12-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Try the steak/salmon combo.\n\n"], "author": "Eric H.", "review": "Finally a healthy fast-casual dinning experience in the neighborhood.
