Around 3 PM on most days the lunch crowd is gone, and I can actually sit inside the little restaurant and enjoy Muracci's amazing curry dishes.  On some days some of the selections might be sold out, but that hasn't bothered me since I'm willing to try something new with each visit.\n\nI love the taste and consistency of Muracci's curry sauce.  The portion is excellent as there is plenty of sauce to mix into the rice.  One of my favorite yelpers once wrote about his desire to lick the plate clean at Muracci's.  If I were not in a public restaurant I too would lick my plate clean each time.  The entire staff at Muracci's is nice and friendly where I'm always greeted by a smile and thanked before departing.\n\nMuracci's curry sauce is a brown colored sauce with tiny specks of chili visible to the eye.  It has a subtle sweetness to it.  I don't take very spicy foods too well and the one time I ordered my curry \"hot\" from Muracci's I didn't look too good when I left the restaurant with my eyes watering and my nose running.  I order my curry \"medium\" all the time now.  It's the perfect degree of spicyness for me because while the sauce still creates a sensation on my tongue, it's a more gentle sensation that will warm my entire mouth and stop just before it reaches my nose.  No runny nose.  No teary eyes.\n\nMy usual order consists of brown rice.  I've had the curry with ramen also, and that was outstanding.  I'm eager to try it with the udon noodles hopefully on my next visit.  The rice dishes come with crunchy pickled cabbage and sweet pickles.  I love combining everything into the rice and then smothering everything with the sauce.  Here are some of the selections I've tried so far:\n\nChicken Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=chh-Ec2DVbLJhhGJnhK1vA) - Very good with big tender pieces of skinless, boneless dark meat chicken.\n\nChicken Katsu Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Gu66z3HwgDZbp8Vabe0B3Q) - Excellent with a big piece of chicken breast breaded and deep fried.  The chicken was juicy and the breading was nice and crunchy without being oily.\n\nSalmon Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=CJ4l4K_QSvNQr5j3oQX4kg) - Excellent as the salmon was grilled to perfection moist and flaky.  The salmon skin had very nice crispy edges and they even added an extra piece of salmon into the sauce.\n\nVegetarian Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=5x7bGOIexkzXs8CVIrpFhA) - I ordered this one \"hot\" and still loved the taste the most even though the curry drove my senses crazy.  The fried tofu really absorbed the flavor of the curry sauce.  The vegetables in this selection are firm (but not hard) carrots and firm (but not crunchy) broccoli.  There are yellow and red bell peppers in there too.  The tofu was of a medium firmness.\n\nChicken and Vegetable Curry over Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Qew_2CR0JUPtk8OQ7Kqd5w) - You have the option between udon and ramen noodles.  This was outstanding as the curry sauce takes the place of the broth.  Lots of dark meat chicken with firm broccoli and carrots.  Lots of scallion and green onion too.  As close to licking a bowl clean without actually doing so as I'll ever go in public.\n\nI've also had the Beef Curry with nice tender chunks of beef and the Ebi Fry Curry with breaded and deep fried shrimp (no photos).

Their KATSU CURRY (not chicken) is one of the best katsu's I've ever had. Always fresh out of the fryer and consistently tender and moist, this is my go to order. The katsu lays on a bed of rice in a biodegradable container, with a small side of pickled cabbage and ginger, and a whole separate container for the curry (choose mild/medium/hot), always an appetizing sight! Servings are large and will fill you right up for lunch, watch out for that afternoon food coma at your desk! \n\nThe few times I've tried other items here, I've always come away thinking I should have just ordered the katsu curry. The one biggest disappointment has been the beef curry. The beef was overdone and dry, lacking that same tender and moist character of the katsu. The ebi fry is good, but just not as filling, or for that matter, fulfilling of a portion as the katsu. I've ventured to try a few of their weekly specials, which too, have been good, but the katsu curry keeps me coming back! You can also substitute brown rice for white rice (no additional charge!) if you're into that.\n\nThe curry is fantastic. Apparently cooked overnight, it has robust flavors and is a great accompaniment to the meats (and non-meats) they have on offer. You can choose the spicyness from mild/medium/hot (and with that, you'll see the amount of chili in your curry rise). They don't skimp on the amount of curry you get with your entree, plenty to go around on your rice and katsu. \n\nA good appetizer while you wait for your mean is one of their Curry Pan's. Sitting on the counter next to the register, under the heat lamp, these little guys are fried pockets of goodness. Bread, fried with various curries inside (vege hot/regular, beef hot/regular, chicken hot/regular). Selection varies based on day/time of day.

It typically takes them 10-20 minutes, depending on how busy it is. The wait in line can be daunting but it's well worth it.

The whole building is painted a weird beige colour and the three shops barely stand out from one another other than the plain, black lettering above their front doors. \n\nMuracci's itself is a small place, similar to the ramen/udon shops found in Japan. The people who own/work at Muracci's are Japanese: they even greeted me with \"Irrashaimase\" (welcome). There are daily/weekly specials, and apparently they're popular, since I attempted to order the special spicy noodle and the cashier told me they were sold out. Aw man!\n\nThe menu has plenty of yummy Japanese offerings, including several different kinds of curry (salmon, ebi fry, etc.), donburi, and some small sushi orders. Prices range under $10, which is average/not bad for lunchtime prices, and a sweet deal for dinner (unfortunately, they do close at 6, so you'd have to go eat an early dinner around 4:30 like I did). \n\nI ordered the salmon curry, extra hot; sat at one of the front counter seats and immediately felt like I was in Japan. It's tight yet cozy; the shop was pretty empty at 4pm, considering most people hadn't left work yet. It took them a little bit to bring my order to me, but no worries, since I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere else.\n\nWhen my curry did arrive, I was surprised to see how huge the plate/portion was! Really good deal for the price I paid! The plate was as large as the rectangular serving tray, and...mm, plenty of curry sauce with a generous portion of salmon on top. I also liked that they gave me the option of choosing brown or white rice--knowing how I am these days, I tend to lean towards brown rice since it's healthier.\n\nThe entree itself was filling; curry wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be, but that's okay, I figured the \"spicy\" was mild in comparison to, say, Thai food. I completed the meal with dorayaki...felt like the dorayaki was a little overpriced, but hell, I guess they gotta make money somehow.\n\nI can see how people would say the place isn't good in terms of the lunch rush--Muracci's does cook everything to-order, so the food is always fresh, but that means it takes a little more time to prepare than most people would prefer. Catering to the Financial District area is a smart move, but it's also kind of a weird spot for the restaurant to be in.\n\nWill be back again to try the other entrees. My friend bought the katsu donburi from Muracci's and it also looked very appetizing.\n\nIn short: Muracci's serves up delicious Japanese \"comfort foods\" in American portions. =)", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-08"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Ebi Fry Curry, with brown rice.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "Muracci's is owned by husband and wife team from Osaka, and named after a nickname for their son. How cute! Even before I looked up the history on their website for this Yelp review, based on taste alone I noticed the unusually fresh and homemade element--either there is a blatantly obvious difference compared to your typical katsu curry, or I'm finally developing some serious food critic skills.\n\n[TL;DR] Homemade style with skilled use of herbs and spices. Would recommend for anyone with a marginal liking for katsu curry.\n\n[THE BACKGROUND]\n\nSo the boo had a katsu craving a few months ago, which prompted me to investigate katsu places in SF. Volcano turned out to be underwhelming (watered-down, and Americanized), Kare-Ken is in the Tenderloin (no we are not sheltered and na\u00efve as to think we'll get mugged eating katsu in the Tenderloin... it's just out of the way), and Muracci's remained on the radar. I therefore made the executive decision to give it a try when we were foraging for lunch around the much-touristy-and-overpriced Union Square area.\n\n[THE AMBIANCE]\n\nBecause it's small and the interior d\u00e9cor doesn't go all-out, Muracci's could be classified as a hole-in-the-wall. Granted you could snag a seat, the dining experience is not bad--the bar stools add a modern touch, and we enjoyed the sunlight and people-watching at the storefront window (or perhaps more like people watching us inhaling the delish curry).\n\n[THE NOMS]\n\nI got the TOFU AND VEGETABLES CURRY ($9) because I felt in dire need of veggies. It's not as sad as it sounds though; the fried tofu, veggies, and brown rice blended into the curry really well. It could have used more assorted/pickled veggies, but I was very impressed with the curry. According to their website, the wife owner \"lovingly prepares\" the curry sauce over 2 days. You could definitely taste the superior quality over those box curries (which I'm sure are manufactured with no love at all). \n\nI stole some pieces of the bf's CHICKEN KATSU CURRY ($9) and I honestly do not know if I've ever had such good katsu. The chicken was tender and juicy, surrounded by a delightful thin panko coating. Dip into the magical curry, devour while the katsu is still crunchy, and you'll be as happy as the grinning Muracci icon.\n\n[OTHER NOTES]\n\n- Prices are not cheap, but for SF it is rather inexpensive at ~$10 or a little more for a filling entr\u00e9e\n- Props to the brown rice option at no extra cost!\n- They have weekly specials but it's not available on weekends\n- There's a small selection of enticing desserts, including roll cakes and dorayaki\n- They serve most food in to-go containers so overall it feels quite street-foody\n- Trash can says \"regular trash only\".... seriously wondering what irregular trash consists of", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-05-10"}, {"excerpts": ["We ended up trying the Chicken Katsu Curry (#4 on menu, $10.45) and the Spicy Noodle ($9.95, #34 on menu).

There are two Muracci's locations in the Bay Area: this one in San Francisco's Financial District and another in Berkeley. The SF FiDi location is a tiny hole in the wall. The food is both affordable and delicious.\n\nI was confused by the name Muracci's. While the name doesn't look Japanese, the food is quite authentic. Muracci is the name of the owners' son. The owners are from Osaka, Japan. According to the menu, the restaurant's curry sauce takes two days to prepare. It comes from a special recipe from Muracci's mom, Tamiko Murata.\n\nMainly open for lunch and early dinner six days a week (closed on Sunday), Muracci's specializes in Japanese curry (almost 10 different varieties), donburi rice bowls, curry noodles, simple sushi rolls (e.g. California rolls), and various Japanese snacks and side dishes such as fried ebi (shrimp), agedashi tofu (deep-fried tofu), and karaage (fried chicken). Filling curry entrees run about $10-11 each and most snacks under $8-9 each.\n\nThere's seating inside the narrow space, but not much. Total seating capacity is about 10. There are two four-person counters, one against the window facing the street and one against a side wall facing a mirror. There's a small table by the kitchen with seating for two. I saw many folks getting their orders to-go in Styrofoam containers. If you order in, trays are brought out to you and the food is served on actual plateware. Water and tea are complimentary and available self-serve in the back. There is a single clean restroom.\n\nIf you want to get the good stuff, go early! We visited around 4pm on a Thursday, after the weekday lunch rush. Unfortunately, the restaurant had run out of our first two choices, the Katsu Curry (fried pork cutlet with curry sauce) and Curry Pan (baked curry bread pouch). Normally, you can find the Curry Pans sitting right next to the cash register underneath a heat lamp. They'd already been completely wiped clean during our visit. I next thought about ordering the Beef Curry, but the lady behind the counter warned us the beef might be unusually tough and chewy. I didn't fully understand her reasoning, but it had to do with the cooking and prep time.\n\nWe ended up trying the Chicken Katsu Curry (#4 on menu, $10.45) and the Spicy Noodle ($9.95, #34 on menu). I was quite pleased with both dishes, particularly the former. The Chicken Katsu Curry was essentially like the Katsu Curry, but made with chicken instead of pork (tonkatsu). The breaded meat was still crispy and savory. There was a generous portion of rich, creamy, brown curry sauce. I was impressed with it. It had great flavor. It was so good, I couldn't stop eating it. Even after finishing the chicken, I kept eating spoonfuls curry with rice. By the way, you have the choice of both white rice and brown rice.\n\nThe curry entree came with a couple different pickled vegetables: red fukujinzuke (which can be made from a variety of vegetables, not sure specifically which one I tried here) and pickled cabbage. They were appetizingly crisp and tart.\n\nThe Spicy Noodle bowl was interesting. You have the choice of udon (thick white noodles) or ramen (thinner yellow noodles). We went with udon. Udon and ramen noodles are typically served in a soup broth. At Muracci's, these noodles are served smothered in curry sauce. The Spicy Noodle bowl contained ground beef topped with freshly chopped green onion. It was indeed spicy and every bit as flavorful as the curry used in the Katsu dish we tried. I'm pretty sure it was the exact same sauce.\n\nI think it's hard to go wrong with the curry dishes here, especially the Katsu.\n\nThere's a display case next to the checkout counter selling pre-packaged containers of Japanese pickles, salads, and plastic-wrapped slices of roll (swirl) cakes (green tea, strawberry, cocoa, tora) and three different kinds of mochi (Japanese rice cakes - white, red bean, green tea).\n\nService is good.

So, finding myself in San Francisco one afternoon, I made my way down Kearney, in search of Muracci's mythical homestyle curry. \n\nIn a city booming and busting with food trends, it seems that Muracci's popularity has in no way declined since opening. Locating this hole-in-the-wall was easy; I scanned Kearney for a line of hungry lunchers spilling out onto the sidewalk, and made my way in toward the counter. Ordering was also easy- as everyone was ordering the chicken katsu curry, I saw no reason to buck the trend.\n\n10 minutes later, I was sitting in front of a bento packed with warm, fluffy rice, chicken katsu, and bright, pickled veggies. The katsu --thick, tender slices of chicken breast beneath a crisp, golden crust-- was particularly well-prepared, and stayed crisp even after a 10 minute walk to my next destination. The curry sauce lent a warming shichimi kick to the entire dish, and paired well with the spicy, tangy cabbage and daikon radish slices, which (alongside the katsu) were the bright stars of the dish. I was surprised to find that I wasn't floored by the curry itself, but grant that it did its job in pulling the bento together. \n\nWhat's really amazing (but also infuriating to me, as an out-of-towner) is how accessible and easy it is to enjoy an inexpensive, good --and I mean good-- lunch in downtown SF.

"], "author": "Wilhelm Y.", "review": "Muracci's has become a favorite lunch stop whenever I'm in the downtown area on a late weekday afternoon.  Around 3 PM on most days the lunch crowd is gone, and I can actually sit inside the little restaurant and enjoy Muracci's amazing curry dishes.  On some days some of the selections might be sold out, but that hasn't bothered me since I'm willing to try something new with each visit.\n\nI love the taste and consistency of Muracci's curry sauce.  The portion is excellent as there is plenty of sauce to mix into the rice.  One of my favorite yelpers once wrote about his desire to lick the plate clean at Muracci's.  If I were not in a public restaurant I too would lick my plate clean each time.  The entire staff at Muracci's is nice and friendly where I'm always greeted by a smile and thanked before departing.\n\nMuracci's curry sauce is a brown colored sauce with tiny specks of chili visible to the eye.  It has a subtle sweetness to it.  I don't take very spicy foods too well and the one time I ordered my curry \"hot\" from Muracci's I didn't look too good when I left the restaurant with my eyes watering and my nose running.  I order my curry \"medium\" all the time now.  It's the perfect degree of spicyness for me because while the sauce still creates a sensation on my tongue, it's a more gentle sensation that will warm my entire mouth and stop just before it reaches my nose.  No runny nose.  No teary eyes.\n\nMy usual order consists of brown rice.  I've had the curry with ramen also, and that was outstanding.  I'm eager to try it with the udon noodles hopefully on my next visit.  The rice dishes come with crunchy pickled cabbage and sweet pickles.  I love combining everything into the rice and then smothering everything with the sauce.  Here are some of the selections I've tried so far:\n\nChicken Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=chh-Ec2DVbLJhhGJnhK1vA) - Very good with big tender pieces of skinless, boneless dark meat chicken.\n\nChicken Katsu Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Gu66z3HwgDZbp8Vabe0B3Q) - Excellent with a big piece of chicken breast breaded and deep fried.  The chicken was juicy and the breading was nice and crunchy without being oily.\n\nSalmon Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=CJ4l4K_QSvNQr5j3oQX4kg) - Excellent as the salmon was grilled to perfection moist and flaky.  The salmon skin had very nice crispy edges and they even added an extra piece of salmon into the sauce.\n\nVegetarian Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=5x7bGOIexkzXs8CVIrpFhA) - I ordered this one \"hot\" and still loved the taste the most even though the curry drove my senses crazy.  The fried tofu really absorbed the flavor of the curry sauce.  The vegetables in this selection are firm (but not hard) carrots and firm (but not crunchy) broccoli.  There are yellow and red bell peppers in there too.  The tofu was of a medium firmness.\n\nChicken and Vegetable Curry over Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Qew_2CR0JUPtk8OQ7Kqd5w) - You have the option between udon and ramen noodles.  This was outstanding as the curry sauce takes the place of the broth.  Lots of dark meat chicken with firm broccoli and carrots.  Lots of scallion and green onion too.  As close to licking a bowl clean without actually doing so as I'll ever go in public.\n\nI've also had the Beef Curry with nice tender chunks of beef and the Ebi Fry Curry with breaded and deep fried shrimp (no photos).  Both were delicious as well.\n\nIt seems you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.

I decided that I was going to do a live assessment and comparison of Muracci's chicken katsu curry with Japacurry's plate.\n\nOn to the food! The pros/cons of my experience:\n\nPROS:\n-This place has a wonderful variety of options for people who are interested in curry, and those who aren't.  Not only were there chicken and pork katsu options, but there was also shrimp.\n-Brown rice is an option without needing to charge you extra for it.\n-Everything is made to order\n-Two types of pickled cabbage is provided with your lunch\n-Curry sauce has a lot of flavor, and there's good breading on the chicken katsu that I had\n\nCONS:\n-So, for starter's, Muracci's little shop is TINY.  On a nice warm day, the tiny shop turns into a sweltering shoe box, cramped with people who are waiting for their food and people picking up their orders via phone order. \n-The ordering system here is totally disorganized.  There are people who called in orders, and people like myself who showed up at the door.  Since there's only one register, it's a huge cluster of people cutting in line to pick up their phone order.  It'd be helpful if they had a separate area of people who were phone orders, but since this place is so small, it's probably not possible.\n-Muracci's portions are deceivingly small.  They spread out a layer of rice on the bottom of a regular sized take out box to make it seem like you're getting a lot for your money.  The truth is, it's really not that much.  Relative to what you get at Japacurry, it's maybe even a little less.\n-The chicken katsu I had was slightly overcooked and dry.  It looked like someone had left it in the pan for too long since the breading on one side was crispier/drier than the other.\n-The curry sauce I had was flavorful, but was sort of thin and more like soupy in consistency.  \n-Lunch was $10.25, compared to Japacurry where with brown rice, your total is $9.00 and you get more food.\n\nSo, based on my experience, Muracci's is overrated.  Perhaps I'm biased because I \"found\" curry through Japacurry and hold them on a pedestal for converting a non-believer like myself into an avid fan.  However, from my experience, I just couldn't get around the letdown feeling I had after starting my meal.

I added an boiled egg for 75 cents. Reminds me of a taiwanese fried pork chop dish I hold near and dear to my heart (flavor profile completely different, but ya know). The curry not surprisingly is the star of the show. The delicious flavor is subtle in its excellence. Medium hot was an adequate amount of kick. I was expecting more due to hype, but as I ate my appreciation grew. I wouldn't say best curry ever, but top 3. I'm sure If I went to Japan my mind would be BLOWN. \n\nChicken Katsu Curry- Respectable fried chicken, but imo the pork was better. Curry was consistent in goodness the second time around. \n\nUdon (chicken and veggie curry)- My friend ordered this dish. She had asked if the curry base was thick and the nice man said it wasn't. After finishing all the noodles a decent sized pool of curry was left. It was curry overload for her. As she threw away the rest I cringed because I could have easily cooked a batch of white rice and dumped that curry over. Instant delicious meal. Her slobber was all in it, I restrained myself. \n\nThe place is small and compact. There is some cramped seating along 2 sides of the restaurant, about 8 seats total. Next time I come back and it's only a matter of time I'll snag an assortment of Korokke to try.

There may be some tables in here somewhere but i have yet to see them. There is a long counter opposite of the kitchen and ordering area but I dont recommend sitting here to eat unless its empty.\n\nOnto the food...ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and grilled chicken curry for a friend, both with the medium heat curry and drove home to enjoy the goods. \n\nEven after a 45 minute drive home was happy to say the katsu chicken was still crispy and hot. The grilled chicken plate seemed to be lacking in portion size however in comparison to the Katsu cutlet so not sure if that is the usual or what. Also I am a BIG stickler on rice consistency and prefer to have rice on the dry side so I have to say it was a bit more mushy for my taste. I tend not to like my rice when it clumps together in big balls and not separate. Again not sure if this is the norm but both plates were the same. \n\nPoured the curry sauce over the plate and that is when I realize these guys are on top  for a reason and that is simply this: their currey sauce here is simply amazing. In my experience there are two kinds of curry sauces I enjoy: the thinner milk/yogurt and/or coconut based sauces from indian and Thai cuisines and the thicker non dairy based ones that I see with chinese/japanese curries and as you can imagine the curry here is the latter variety.\n\nThis curry sauce is magic. I am pretty sure if I poured it over anything it would immediately turn it into the best curry-whatever it is I just poured over it dish of all time. It just has the perfect balance of flavors and a deep rich curry flavor that any curry dish or sauce should strive for. \n\n So in spite of the mushy rice and just so-so chicken katsu the dish immediately becomes top tier once you add the curry. I would just go ahead and order another another to-go bowl of curry as that one helping they give you will not satiate your craving for the curry and you will inevitably end up with leftover rice or chicken with no sauce left.\n\nAlso the main reason for the 5 stars? You would think it would be the curry sauce and while it is special I have to say the thing that keeps me going back to SF in the middle of the ridiculous lunch rush even though I work nowhere near SF is the freakin CURRY PAN. These little deep fried, panko bread rolled, dough hot pockets filled with tasty curry love are simply....i have no words. The outer crust is fried to perfection and does not taste oily at all and has just the perfect salty and chewy exterior before you bite down and hit the curry gold inside. Fillings come in chicken, hot chicken, beef, hot beef, beef and veggie and just veggie. The filling is the perfect level of moistness not runny and not to dry or crumbly and they have the perfect ratio of filling to bread. Dip in curry sauce and say goodnight to any number of top 5 foods you have on your list.\n\nSo in summary: Go to Muraccis. Buy Curry Pan. Buy Curry sauce. Dip.

We've been looking forward to going since the first couple of yelp reviews were posted.  Now, it looks like Muracci's is quite well known.\n\n1) The place is pretty camouflaged and unassuming.  We spent 20 minutes looking for it!  There isn't a big sign like the other nearby restos (Banana House, Murphy's Irish Pub....for example) For those that are first timers it is located closer to the corner of BUSH and Kearny than pine.  In fact, it is right next door the  Cinta Aveda Institute and has a tan/beige facade.\n\n2) The lines can grow pretty long.\n\n3) If you are in a hurry, order the EXPRESS curry.  The boyfriend and I ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and it took about 15 minutes.\n\n4) For most Asians, HOT translates to eh...spicy.  It will make your nose run.\n\n5) it is pretty cheap.  I think that the boyfriend and I spent under 20 dollars on our two chicken katsu curries.\n\n6) The inside is small and can be stuffy.  They pack your food to go...so find a sunny spot near union square to enjoy your curry.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied.  Yet my minor complaints:  1) the curry was too runny and 2) my mom puts potatoes, carrots and more meat into hers (who doesn't love their MOM's CURRY more??? and she didn't even pay me to type that!) \n\nPlus, It looks like they use the S&B curry powder (my mom uses the same) and that is what really makes it taste great and easy to churn out.  I think that this is a great deal for those working downtown.  Yet, I spent $ to park and I don't think that it would be someplace to go OUT of your way to try if you aren't already in the area.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-06-16"}, {"excerpts": ["all I can say is I hate curry and the chicken katsu curry is to die for!"], "author": "Martin A.", "review": "Amazing! all I can say is I hate curry and the chicken katsu curry is to die for!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-01-10"}, {"excerpts": ["This place has amazing pork and chicken katsu curry in San Francisco.

Around 3 PM on most days the lunch crowd is gone, and I can actually sit inside the little restaurant and enjoy Muracci's amazing curry dishes.  On some days some of the selections might be sold out, but that hasn't bothered me since I'm willing to try something new with each visit.\n\nI love the taste and consistency of Muracci's curry sauce.  The portion is excellent as there is plenty of sauce to mix into the rice.  One of my favorite yelpers once wrote about his desire to lick the plate clean at Muracci's.  If I were not in a public restaurant I too would lick my plate clean each time.  The entire staff at Muracci's is nice and friendly where I'm always greeted by a smile and thanked before departing.\n\nMuracci's curry sauce is a brown colored sauce with tiny specks of chili visible to the eye.  It has a subtle sweetness to it.  I don't take very spicy foods too well and the one time I ordered my curry \"hot\" from Muracci's I didn't look too good when I left the restaurant with my eyes watering and my nose running.  I order my curry \"medium\" all the time now.  It's the perfect degree of spicyness for me because while the sauce still creates a sensation on my tongue, it's a more gentle sensation that will warm my entire mouth and stop just before it reaches my nose.  No runny nose.  No teary eyes.\n\nMy usual order consists of brown rice.  I've had the curry with ramen also, and that was outstanding.  I'm eager to try it with the udon noodles hopefully on my next visit.  The rice dishes come with crunchy pickled cabbage and sweet pickles.  I love combining everything into the rice and then smothering everything with the sauce.  Here are some of the selections I've tried so far:\n\nChicken Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=chh-Ec2DVbLJhhGJnhK1vA) - Very good with big tender pieces of skinless, boneless dark meat chicken.\n\nChicken Katsu Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Gu66z3HwgDZbp8Vabe0B3Q) - Excellent with a big piece of chicken breast breaded and deep fried.  The chicken was juicy and the breading was nice and crunchy without being oily.\n\nSalmon Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=CJ4l4K_QSvNQr5j3oQX4kg) - Excellent as the salmon was grilled to perfection moist and flaky.  The salmon skin had very nice crispy edges and they even added an extra piece of salmon into the sauce.\n\nVegetarian Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=5x7bGOIexkzXs8CVIrpFhA) - I ordered this one \"hot\" and still loved the taste the most even though the curry drove my senses crazy.  The fried tofu really absorbed the flavor of the curry sauce.  The vegetables in this selection are firm (but not hard) carrots and firm (but not crunchy) broccoli.  There are yellow and red bell peppers in there too.  The tofu was of a medium firmness.\n\nChicken and Vegetable Curry over Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Qew_2CR0JUPtk8OQ7Kqd5w) - You have the option between udon and ramen noodles.  This was outstanding as the curry sauce takes the place of the broth.  Lots of dark meat chicken with firm broccoli and carrots.  Lots of scallion and green onion too.  As close to licking a bowl clean without actually doing so as I'll ever go in public.\n\nI've also had the Beef Curry with nice tender chunks of beef and the Ebi Fry Curry with breaded and deep fried shrimp (no photos).  Both were delicious as well.\n\nIt seems you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  Muracci's is outstanding!", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Ebi fry curry is perfect!

I love the brown rice option as well. \n\n(2) Timing. During the lunch hour, Muracci's goes ape, and it's unpleasant. It's a good plan to go earlier or later than noon (although that's pretty much the consensus with any lunch spot at noon), which brings me to my next point. \n\n(3) Tiny. Muracci's is the definition of tiny. No, you may not dine in. There's a long line going out the door usually, and someone walks through the line and takes your order. It's best to have your act together so you don't hold things up, especially if I am in line behind you. If you special order be prepared to wait.\n\n(4) Potato Pancake. Of course you want one of those. So good. \n\n(5) Sriracha. You can order your curry mild, medium or hot. I like it hot, but Muracci's version of \"hot\" is only hot if you are a little beech. \n\nSo I'm paying my tab and I asked if they had sriracha. The cashier looked at me as though I had suddenly caught on fire. I became instantly confused. Did I say sriracha incorrectly? Was this not Japanese curry? I became flummoxed. I said, \"sriracha(?)\" again, with pause. The cashier just looked at me like, \"What the hell is sriracha?\"  Completely confused, I looked to my friend for help. She's a lot mouthier than me (imagine that)--so she asked forthrightly, \"Are you serious? You don't know sriracha?\"  Indeed, I'm pretty sure it's the official hot sauce of San Francisco. I put that sh** on everything. The cashier turned to ask the cooks--sriracha? They said no, but at least they knew what it was. They gave me chili powder on the side, which is not an acceptable substitute, as you well know. But not a big deal--I just wanted to know if they had it, because if so, I'm down. I ended up having to wait a lot longer for my order because I made this (what I thought was a simple) request. Whoops. Lesson: Muracci's does not have sriracha.

Prices range under $10, which is average/not bad for lunchtime prices, and a sweet deal for dinner (unfortunately, they do close at 6, so you'd have to go eat an early dinner around 4:30 like I did). \n\nI ordered the salmon curry, extra hot; sat at one of the front counter seats and immediately felt like I was in Japan. It's tight yet cozy; the shop was pretty empty at 4pm, considering most people hadn't left work yet. It took them a little bit to bring my order to me, but no worries, since I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere else.\n\nWhen my curry did arrive, I was surprised to see how huge the plate/portion was! Really good deal for the price I paid! The plate was as large as the rectangular serving tray, and...mm, plenty of curry sauce with a generous portion of salmon on top. I also liked that they gave me the option of choosing brown or white rice--knowing how I am these days, I tend to lean towards brown rice since it's healthier.\n\nThe entree itself was filling; curry wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be, but that's okay, I figured the \"spicy\" was mild in comparison to, say, Thai food. I completed the meal with dorayaki...felt like the dorayaki was a little overpriced, but hell, I guess they gotta make money somehow.\n\nI can see how people would say the place isn't good in terms of the lunch rush--Muracci's does cook everything to-order, so the food is always fresh, but that means it takes a little more time to prepare than most people would prefer. Catering to the Financial District area is a smart move, but it's also kind of a weird spot for the restaurant to be in.\n\nWill be back again to try the other entrees. My friend bought the katsu donburi from Muracci's and it also looked very appetizing.\n\nIn short: Muracci's serves up delicious Japanese \"comfort foods\" in American portions. =)", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Katsudon & grilled salmon curry!\n"], "author": "Jessica F.", "review": "So yummy!

I also got the curry pan ($3.50) and learned from the cashier that the type of curry pan on offer changes daily. The Monday special was chicken. I bought a piece of the strawberry roll cake, as well ($2.45). My boyfriend got the katsu don ($11.20).\n\nSeating here is extremely limited, so everything is served in to-go packaging in case you more than likely need to take your food elsewhere because there's nowhere to sit. Luckily my boyfriend and I grabbed the tiny table for two around the corner from the cashwrap and got to eat in peace, out of the way of waiting guests.\n\nI was surprised how big my plate of food was; this doesn't happen to me very often, but I actually ended up getting two meals out of this plate. Admittedly, I felt that there could've been a few mores pieces of karaage, but getting lunch and dinner out of one meal made up for that in my mind. I appreciated that the curry sauce was in its own separate container and I could add it to the plate according to my own preference. The curry was delicious and spicy, but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. The chicken was cooked well and juicy on the inside.\n\nMy boyfriend felt his katsu don was solid all around and a hefty amount of food for the price, though his only complaint was that the bowl is served with a lid. That causes the contents of the bowl to steam a bit, so the katsu isn't as crispy as it could be, which might be a bigger issue if you're taking your food to-go.\n\nI wish we'd ordered two of the curry pan because that was so good. The bread was a little crisp, golden, and the chicken curry on the inside was well flavored. I ate the cake for dessert with dinner and thought it was a good amount of sweet without being sickeningly so, and the cake was soft and spongy.\n\nAll in all, a very impressive first impression from Muracci's for me.

Next time I hope to add a runny fried egg to it.\n\nUnfortunately, I came in during peak lunch time so all the seats were taken so I had to order my food to-go and reheat them when I got home.  They were both still delicious even after reheating, but I would've loved to have experienced eating the hot food straight out of the kitchen.  Maybe next time I'll arrive earlier to grab a seat.\n\nOne thing that was awkward was that I had to repeat my order to the cashier 3 times.  She was probably new but the fact that she didn't know what Karaage Curry was or couldn't understand me made the customer service experience a little awkward for me.\n\nBest Japanese Curry?  That's still up for debate for me.  I still like the curry from Kaz and Usagi from San Mateo and On The Bridge as my top 3 favorites.  But I'd say Muracci's is slightly better than JapaCurry which is still a high compliment from me.

The line wasn't out the door as many people have experienced at lunch time, but a number of people had already ordered and were waiting for their food. But the line moves fast here and the food comes fast, too.\n\nI went with the karaage curry, hot, with white rice ($12.45) and extra rice ($3.00). I also got the curry pan ($3.50) and learned from the cashier that the type of curry pan on offer changes daily. The Monday special was chicken. I bought a piece of the strawberry roll cake, as well ($2.45). My boyfriend got the katsu don ($11.20).\n\nSeating here is extremely limited, so everything is served in to-go packaging in case you more than likely need to take your food elsewhere because there's nowhere to sit. Luckily my boyfriend and I grabbed the tiny table for two around the corner from the cashwrap and got to eat in peace, out of the way of waiting guests.\n\nI was surprised how big my plate of food was; this doesn't happen to me very often, but I actually ended up getting two meals out of this plate. Admittedly, I felt that there could've been a few mores pieces of karaage, but getting lunch and dinner out of one meal made up for that in my mind. I appreciated that the curry sauce was in its own separate container and I could add it to the plate according to my own preference. The curry was delicious and spicy, but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. The chicken was cooked well and juicy on the inside.\n\nMy boyfriend felt his katsu don was solid all around and a hefty amount of food for the price, though his only complaint was that the bowl is served with a lid. That causes the contents of the bowl to steam a bit, so the katsu isn't as crispy as it could be, which might be a bigger issue if you're taking your food to-go.\n\nI wish we'd ordered two of the curry pan because that was so good. The bread was a little crisp, golden, and the chicken curry on the inside was well flavored. I ate the cake for dessert with dinner and thought it was a good amount of sweet without being sickeningly so, and the cake was soft and spongy.\n\nAll in all, a very impressive first impression from Muracci's for me. I really can't wait to go back and get more curry, and definitely order more than one curry pan.

There are two Muracci's locations in the Bay Area: this one in San Francisco's Financial District and another in Berkeley. The SF FiDi location is a tiny hole in the wall. The food is both affordable and delicious.\n\nI was confused by the name Muracci's. While the name doesn't look Japanese, the food is quite authentic. Muracci is the name of the owners' son. The owners are from Osaka, Japan. According to the menu, the restaurant's curry sauce takes two days to prepare. It comes from a special recipe from Muracci's mom, Tamiko Murata.\n\nMainly open for lunch and early dinner six days a week (closed on Sunday), Muracci's specializes in Japanese curry (almost 10 different varieties), donburi rice bowls, curry noodles, simple sushi rolls (e.g. California rolls), and various Japanese snacks and side dishes such as fried ebi (shrimp), agedashi tofu (deep-fried tofu), and karaage (fried chicken). Filling curry entrees run about $10-11 each and most snacks under $8-9 each.\n\nThere's seating inside the narrow space, but not much. Total seating capacity is about 10. There are two four-person counters, one against the window facing the street and one against a side wall facing a mirror. There's a small table by the kitchen with seating for two. I saw many folks getting their orders to-go in Styrofoam containers. If you order in, trays are brought out to you and the food is served on actual plateware. Water and tea are complimentary and available self-serve in the back. There is a single clean restroom.\n\nIf you want to get the good stuff, go early! We visited around 4pm on a Thursday, after the weekday lunch rush. Unfortunately, the restaurant had run out of our first two choices, the Katsu Curry (fried pork cutlet with curry sauce) and Curry Pan (baked curry bread pouch). Normally, you can find the Curry Pans sitting right next to the cash register underneath a heat lamp. They'd already been completely wiped clean during our visit. I next thought about ordering the Beef Curry, but the lady behind the counter warned us the beef might be unusually tough and chewy. I didn't fully understand her reasoning, but it had to do with the cooking and prep time.\n\nWe ended up trying the Chicken Katsu Curry (#4 on menu, $10.45) and the Spicy Noodle ($9.95, #34 on menu). I was quite pleased with both dishes, particularly the former. The Chicken Katsu Curry was essentially like the Katsu Curry, but made with chicken instead of pork (tonkatsu). The breaded meat was still crispy and savory. There was a generous portion of rich, creamy, brown curry sauce. I was impressed with it. It had great flavor. It was so good, I couldn't stop eating it. Even after finishing the chicken, I kept eating spoonfuls curry with rice. By the way, you have the choice of both white rice and brown rice.\n\nThe curry entree came with a couple different pickled vegetables: red fukujinzuke (which can be made from a variety of vegetables, not sure specifically which one I tried here) and pickled cabbage. They were appetizingly crisp and tart.\n\nThe Spicy Noodle bowl was interesting. You have the choice of udon (thick white noodles) or ramen (thinner yellow noodles). We went with udon. Udon and ramen noodles are typically served in a soup broth. At Muracci's, these noodles are served smothered in curry sauce. The Spicy Noodle bowl contained ground beef topped with freshly chopped green onion. It was indeed spicy and every bit as flavorful as the curry used in the Katsu dish we tried. I'm pretty sure it was the exact same sauce.\n\nI think it's hard to go wrong with the curry dishes here, especially the Katsu.\n\nThere's a display case next to the checkout counter selling pre-packaged containers of Japanese pickles, salads, and plastic-wrapped slices of roll (swirl) cakes (green tea, strawberry, cocoa, tora) and three different kinds of mochi (Japanese rice cakes - white, red bean, green tea).\n\nService is good. It took a few minutes for our orders to come out, but I think that's because the staff were freshly preparing several of the ingredients. The staff was friendly and helpful.

The whole building is painted a weird beige colour and the three shops barely stand out from one another other than the plain, black lettering above their front doors. \n\nMuracci's itself is a small place, similar to the ramen/udon shops found in Japan. The people who own/work at Muracci's are Japanese: they even greeted me with \"Irrashaimase\" (welcome). There are daily/weekly specials, and apparently they're popular, since I attempted to order the special spicy noodle and the cashier told me they were sold out. Aw man!\n\nThe menu has plenty of yummy Japanese offerings, including several different kinds of curry (salmon, ebi fry, etc.), donburi, and some small sushi orders. Prices range under $10, which is average/not bad for lunchtime prices, and a sweet deal for dinner (unfortunately, they do close at 6, so you'd have to go eat an early dinner around 4:30 like I did). \n\nI ordered the salmon curry, extra hot; sat at one of the front counter seats and immediately felt like I was in Japan. It's tight yet cozy; the shop was pretty empty at 4pm, considering most people hadn't left work yet. It took them a little bit to bring my order to me, but no worries, since I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere else.\n\nWhen my curry did arrive, I was surprised to see how huge the plate/portion was! Really good deal for the price I paid! The plate was as large as the rectangular serving tray, and...mm, plenty of curry sauce with a generous portion of salmon on top. I also liked that they gave me the option of choosing brown or white rice--knowing how I am these days, I tend to lean towards brown rice since it's healthier.\n\nThe entree itself was filling; curry wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be, but that's okay, I figured the \"spicy\" was mild in comparison to, say, Thai food. I completed the meal with dorayaki...felt like the dorayaki was a little overpriced, but hell, I guess they gotta make money somehow.\n\nI can see how people would say the place isn't good in terms of the lunch rush--Muracci's does cook everything to-order, so the food is always fresh, but that means it takes a little more time to prepare than most people would prefer. Catering to the Financial District area is a smart move, but it's also kind of a weird spot for the restaurant to be in.\n\nWill be back again to try the other entrees.

The line wasn't out the door as many people have experienced at lunch time, but a number of people had already ordered and were waiting for their food. But the line moves fast here and the food comes fast, too.\n\nI went with the karaage curry, hot, with white rice ($12.45) and extra rice ($3.00). I also got the curry pan ($3.50) and learned from the cashier that the type of curry pan on offer changes daily. The Monday special was chicken. I bought a piece of the strawberry roll cake, as well ($2.45). My boyfriend got the katsu don ($11.20).\n\nSeating here is extremely limited, so everything is served in to-go packaging in case you more than likely need to take your food elsewhere because there's nowhere to sit. Luckily my boyfriend and I grabbed the tiny table for two around the corner from the cashwrap and got to eat in peace, out of the way of waiting guests.\n\nI was surprised how big my plate of food was; this doesn't happen to me very often, but I actually ended up getting two meals out of this plate. Admittedly, I felt that there could've been a few mores pieces of karaage, but getting lunch and dinner out of one meal made up for that in my mind. I appreciated that the curry sauce was in its own separate container and I could add it to the plate according to my own preference. The curry was delicious and spicy, but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. The chicken was cooked well and juicy on the inside.\n\nMy boyfriend felt his katsu don was solid all around and a hefty amount of food for the price, though his only complaint was that the bowl is served with a lid. That causes the contents of the bowl to steam a bit, so the katsu isn't as crispy as it could be, which might be a bigger issue if you're taking your food to-go.\n\nI wish we'd ordered two of the curry pan because that was so good. The bread was a little crisp, golden, and the chicken curry on the inside was well flavored. I ate the cake for dessert with dinner and thought it was a good amount of sweet without being sickeningly so, and the cake was soft and spongy.\n\nAll in all, a very impressive first impression from Muracci's for me.

There are two Muracci's locations in the Bay Area: this one in San Francisco's Financial District and another in Berkeley. The SF FiDi location is a tiny hole in the wall. The food is both affordable and delicious.\n\nI was confused by the name Muracci's. While the name doesn't look Japanese, the food is quite authentic. Muracci is the name of the owners' son. The owners are from Osaka, Japan. According to the menu, the restaurant's curry sauce takes two days to prepare. It comes from a special recipe from Muracci's mom, Tamiko Murata.\n\nMainly open for lunch and early dinner six days a week (closed on Sunday), Muracci's specializes in Japanese curry (almost 10 different varieties), donburi rice bowls, curry noodles, simple sushi rolls (e.g. California rolls), and various Japanese snacks and side dishes such as fried ebi (shrimp), agedashi tofu (deep-fried tofu), and karaage (fried chicken). Filling curry entrees run about $10-11 each and most snacks under $8-9 each.\n\nThere's seating inside the narrow space, but not much. Total seating capacity is about 10. There are two four-person counters, one against the window facing the street and one against a side wall facing a mirror. There's a small table by the kitchen with seating for two. I saw many folks getting their orders to-go in Styrofoam containers. If you order in, trays are brought out to you and the food is served on actual plateware. Water and tea are complimentary and available self-serve in the back. There is a single clean restroom.\n\nIf you want to get the good stuff, go early! We visited around 4pm on a Thursday, after the weekday lunch rush. Unfortunately, the restaurant had run out of our first two choices, the Katsu Curry (fried pork cutlet with curry sauce) and Curry Pan (baked curry bread pouch). Normally, you can find the Curry Pans sitting right next to the cash register underneath a heat lamp. They'd already been completely wiped clean during our visit. I next thought about ordering the Beef Curry, but the lady behind the counter warned us the beef might be unusually tough and chewy. I didn't fully understand her reasoning, but it had to do with the cooking and prep time.\n\nWe ended up trying the Chicken Katsu Curry (#4 on menu, $10.45) and the Spicy Noodle ($9.95, #34 on menu). I was quite pleased with both dishes, particularly the former. The Chicken Katsu Curry was essentially like the Katsu Curry, but made with chicken instead of pork (tonkatsu). The breaded meat was still crispy and savory. There was a generous portion of rich, creamy, brown curry sauce. I was impressed with it. It had great flavor. It was so good, I couldn't stop eating it. Even after finishing the chicken, I kept eating spoonfuls curry with rice. By the way, you have the choice of both white rice and brown rice.\n\nThe curry entree came with a couple different pickled vegetables: red fukujinzuke (which can be made from a variety of vegetables, not sure specifically which one I tried here) and pickled cabbage. They were appetizingly crisp and tart.\n\nThe Spicy Noodle bowl was interesting. You have the choice of udon (thick white noodles) or ramen (thinner yellow noodles). We went with udon. Udon and ramen noodles are typically served in a soup broth. At Muracci's, these noodles are served smothered in curry sauce. The Spicy Noodle bowl contained ground beef topped with freshly chopped green onion. It was indeed spicy and every bit as flavorful as the curry used in the Katsu dish we tried. I'm pretty sure it was the exact same sauce.\n\nI think it's hard to go wrong with the curry dishes here, especially the Katsu.\n\nThere's a display case next to the checkout counter selling pre-packaged containers of Japanese pickles, salads, and plastic-wrapped slices of roll (swirl) cakes (green tea, strawberry, cocoa, tora) and three different kinds of mochi (Japanese rice cakes - white, red bean, green tea).\n\nService is good.

It's a VERY small restaurant, with ~4 seats in line against the wall, and another maybe 6-8 seats in line along the front window.  Note that they typically do not do sushi on weekends.  The staff is friendly and responsive.  I had the Katsu Curry (pork cutlets with curry).  It comes with a side of white rice or brown and some pickled vegetables.  You can have your curry mild, medium, or hot.  The curry is naturally spicy already, so just keep that in mind - you are just adding more spice.  I thought they made it pretty fast, less than 10 min wait.  The katsu was very crispy and cooked well.  The curry sauce itself was OK, the flavor was very common for me.  Medium spicy had the right amount of heat, but most people not accustomed to this kind of cuisine or other cultural foods will find that mild is probably too much to handle (you know who you are =P).  The portion size is good, it will fill you up!  I could have eaten more, but I was still satisfied.\n\nMy girlfriend had the spicy noodle.  You get a choice of ramen or udon, she had udon with hot spicy level.  It was really spicy, scorching, but she likes it that way.  Portion size was deceiving, it looked like a small dinky bowl of noodles, but she was stuffed after it.  Watchout guys =)!  The sauce is very thick with ground beef and green onions, it's like japanese spaghetti, don't think of it as like a noodle soup dish, but instead, a thick noodle curry dish.  \n\nWe also had the curry pan - hot, which was not that spicy.

Well technically, you can but you have to shell out some extra $1.50 for it. \n\nThe curry had a soupy consistency. It wasn't necessarily a negative point for me but maybe some people would like their curry more thicker. If there were more vegetables provided, it would have balanced it out more because I just ended up with mostly soaked rice to eat. A couple positives: The curry had a nice savory taste and the few vegetables I got were hot and cooked fine (not over/under cooked). I did enjoy the red and white pickles that came with the plate. They were crisp and packed a punch flavor wise. I wish I had more of those to mix in with my rice. \n\nDue to all the rave reviews, I want to give them the benefit of a doubt and the possibility that they were having an \"off day\".

Their KATSU CURRY (not chicken) is one of the best katsu's I've ever had. Always fresh out of the fryer and consistently tender and moist, this is my go to order. The katsu lays on a bed of rice in a biodegradable container, with a small side of pickled cabbage and ginger, and a whole separate container for the curry (choose mild/medium/hot), always an appetizing sight! Servings are large and will fill you right up for lunch, watch out for that afternoon food coma at your desk! \n\nThe few times I've tried other items here, I've always come away thinking I should have just ordered the katsu curry. The one biggest disappointment has been the beef curry. The beef was overdone and dry, lacking that same tender and moist character of the katsu. The ebi fry is good, but just not as filling, or for that matter, fulfilling of a portion as the katsu. I've ventured to try a few of their weekly specials, which too, have been good, but the katsu curry keeps me coming back! You can also substitute brown rice for white rice (no additional charge!) if you're into that.\n\nThe curry is fantastic. Apparently cooked overnight, it has robust flavors and is a great accompaniment to the meats (and non-meats) they have on offer. You can choose the spicyness from mild/medium/hot (and with that, you'll see the amount of chili in your curry rise). They don't skimp on the amount of curry you get with your entree, plenty to go around on your rice and katsu. \n\nA good appetizer while you wait for your mean is one of their Curry Pan's. Sitting on the counter next to the register, under the heat lamp, these little guys are fried pockets of goodness. Bread, fried with various curries inside (vege hot/regular, beef hot/regular, chicken hot/regular). Selection varies based on day/time of day.

However, if you do eat in, you'll be treated to service on a large plate and silverware, with the rice/meat/curry spread out across it. \n\nIf you're in a hurry and know what you want, call ahead and place your order for pickup. It typically takes them 10-20 minutes, depending on how busy it is. The wait in line can be daunting but it's well worth it.

There may be some tables in here somewhere but i have yet to see them. There is a long counter opposite of the kitchen and ordering area but I dont recommend sitting here to eat unless its empty.\n\nOnto the food...ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and grilled chicken curry for a friend, both with the medium heat curry and drove home to enjoy the goods. \n\nEven after a 45 minute drive home was happy to say the katsu chicken was still crispy and hot. The grilled chicken plate seemed to be lacking in portion size however in comparison to the Katsu cutlet so not sure if that is the usual or what. Also I am a BIG stickler on rice consistency and prefer to have rice on the dry side so I have to say it was a bit more mushy for my taste. I tend not to like my rice when it clumps together in big balls and not separate. Again not sure if this is the norm but both plates were the same. \n\nPoured the curry sauce over the plate and that is when I realize these guys are on top  for a reason and that is simply this: their currey sauce here is simply amazing. In my experience there are two kinds of curry sauces I enjoy: the thinner milk/yogurt and/or coconut based sauces from indian and Thai cuisines and the thicker non dairy based ones that I see with chinese/japanese curries and as you can imagine the curry here is the latter variety.\n\nThis curry sauce is magic. I am pretty sure if I poured it over anything it would immediately turn it into the best curry-whatever it is I just poured over it dish of all time. It just has the perfect balance of flavors and a deep rich curry flavor that any curry dish or sauce should strive for. \n\n So in spite of the mushy rice and just so-so chicken katsu the dish immediately becomes top tier once you add the curry. I would just go ahead and order another another to-go bowl of curry as that one helping they give you will not satiate your craving for the curry and you will inevitably end up with leftover rice or chicken with no sauce left.\n\nAlso the main reason for the 5 stars? You would think it would be the curry sauce and while it is special I have to say the thing that keeps me going back to SF in the middle of the ridiculous lunch rush even though I work nowhere near SF is the freakin CURRY PAN. These little deep fried, panko bread rolled, dough hot pockets filled with tasty curry love are simply....i have no words. The outer crust is fried to perfection and does not taste oily at all and has just the perfect salty and chewy exterior before you bite down and hit the curry gold inside. Fillings come in chicken, hot chicken, beef, hot beef, beef and veggie and just veggie. The filling is the perfect level of moistness not runny and not to dry or crumbly and they have the perfect ratio of filling to bread. Dip in curry sauce and say goodnight to any number of top 5 foods you have on your list.\n\nSo in summary: Go to Muraccis. Buy Curry Pan. Buy Curry sauce. Dip.

How cute! Even before I looked up the history on their website for this Yelp review, based on taste alone I noticed the unusually fresh and homemade element--either there is a blatantly obvious difference compared to your typical katsu curry, or I'm finally developing some serious food critic skills.\n\n[TL;DR] Homemade style with skilled use of herbs and spices. Would recommend for anyone with a marginal liking for katsu curry.\n\n[THE BACKGROUND]\n\nSo the boo had a katsu craving a few months ago, which prompted me to investigate katsu places in SF. Volcano turned out to be underwhelming (watered-down, and Americanized), Kare-Ken is in the Tenderloin (no we are not sheltered and na\u00efve as to think we'll get mugged eating katsu in the Tenderloin... it's just out of the way), and Muracci's remained on the radar. I therefore made the executive decision to give it a try when we were foraging for lunch around the much-touristy-and-overpriced Union Square area.\n\n[THE AMBIANCE]\n\nBecause it's small and the interior d\u00e9cor doesn't go all-out, Muracci's could be classified as a hole-in-the-wall. Granted you could snag a seat, the dining experience is not bad--the bar stools add a modern touch, and we enjoyed the sunlight and people-watching at the storefront window (or perhaps more like people watching us inhaling the delish curry).\n\n[THE NOMS]\n\nI got the TOFU AND VEGETABLES CURRY ($9) because I felt in dire need of veggies. It's not as sad as it sounds though; the fried tofu, veggies, and brown rice blended into the curry really well. It could have used more assorted/pickled veggies, but I was very impressed with the curry. According to their website, the wife owner \"lovingly prepares\" the curry sauce over 2 days.

The whole building is painted a weird beige colour and the three shops barely stand out from one another other than the plain, black lettering above their front doors. \n\nMuracci's itself is a small place, similar to the ramen/udon shops found in Japan. The people who own/work at Muracci's are Japanese: they even greeted me with \"Irrashaimase\" (welcome). There are daily/weekly specials, and apparently they're popular, since I attempted to order the special spicy noodle and the cashier told me they were sold out. Aw man!\n\nThe menu has plenty of yummy Japanese offerings, including several different kinds of curry (salmon, ebi fry, etc.), donburi, and some small sushi orders. Prices range under $10, which is average/not bad for lunchtime prices, and a sweet deal for dinner (unfortunately, they do close at 6, so you'd have to go eat an early dinner around 4:30 like I did). \n\nI ordered the salmon curry, extra hot; sat at one of the front counter seats and immediately felt like I was in Japan. It's tight yet cozy; the shop was pretty empty at 4pm, considering most people hadn't left work yet. It took them a little bit to bring my order to me, but no worries, since I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere else.\n\nWhen my curry did arrive, I was surprised to see how huge the plate/portion was! Really good deal for the price I paid! The plate was as large as the rectangular serving tray, and...mm, plenty of curry sauce with a generous portion of salmon on top. I also liked that they gave me the option of choosing brown or white rice--knowing how I am these days, I tend to lean towards brown rice since it's healthier.\n\nThe entree itself was filling; curry wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be, but that's okay, I figured the \"spicy\" was mild in comparison to, say, Thai food. I completed the meal with dorayaki...felt like the dorayaki was a little overpriced, but hell, I guess they gotta make money somehow.\n\nI can see how people would say the place isn't good in terms of the lunch rush--Muracci's does cook everything to-order, so the food is always fresh, but that means it takes a little more time to prepare than most people would prefer. Catering to the Financial District area is a smart move, but it's also kind of a weird spot for the restaurant to be in.\n\nWill be back again to try the other entrees.

How cute! Even before I looked up the history on their website for this Yelp review, based on taste alone I noticed the unusually fresh and homemade element--either there is a blatantly obvious difference compared to your typical katsu curry, or I'm finally developing some serious food critic skills.\n\n[TL;DR] Homemade style with skilled use of herbs and spices. Would recommend for anyone with a marginal liking for katsu curry.\n\n[THE BACKGROUND]\n\nSo the boo had a katsu craving a few months ago, which prompted me to investigate katsu places in SF. Volcano turned out to be underwhelming (watered-down, and Americanized), Kare-Ken is in the Tenderloin (no we are not sheltered and na\u00efve as to think we'll get mugged eating katsu in the Tenderloin... it's just out of the way), and Muracci's remained on the radar. I therefore made the executive decision to give it a try when we were foraging for lunch around the much-touristy-and-overpriced Union Square area.\n\n[THE AMBIANCE]\n\nBecause it's small and the interior d\u00e9cor doesn't go all-out, Muracci's could be classified as a hole-in-the-wall. Granted you could snag a seat, the dining experience is not bad--the bar stools add a modern touch, and we enjoyed the sunlight and people-watching at the storefront window (or perhaps more like people watching us inhaling the delish curry).\n\n[THE NOMS]\n\nI got the TOFU AND VEGETABLES CURRY ($9) because I felt in dire need of veggies. It's not as sad as it sounds though; the fried tofu, veggies, and brown rice blended into the curry really well. It could have used more assorted/pickled veggies, but I was very impressed with the curry. According to their website, the wife owner \"lovingly prepares\" the curry sauce over 2 days. You could definitely taste the superior quality over those box curries (which I'm sure are manufactured with no love at all). \n\nI stole some pieces of the bf's CHICKEN KATSU CURRY ($9) and I honestly do not know if I've ever had such good katsu.
