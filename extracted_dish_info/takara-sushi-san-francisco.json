I've eaten here about 4x now, and I've enjoyed every meal! \n\nSashimi is always fresh, and they have a pretty good selection of food options to choose from. Here are some of the items I've had:\n- Volcano Roll (5 stars): Eel/mango/tuna/salmon with some crispy flakes. Yum! Doesn't look like a traditional roll, but under all the crispy flakes, you'll find the delicious pieces of sushi, don't worry.\n- Summer Roll (3.5 stars): A bit plain, but I like it when I'm trying to go for something simple and lighter since it's wrapped with soy paper and doesn't have any extravagant sauces on it.\n- Dinosaur Roll (4 stars): Soft-shell crab goodness! Sometimes the soft shell crab is prepared better than others, but overall a solid roll.\n- Spicy Tuna Hand Roll (5 stars): Good tuna with a perfect amount of spiciness.\n- Eggplant Special (5 stars): Super delicious combo of scallop/eggplant/shrimp! Spicy miso sauce gives each bite a nice kick.\n- Tempura Udon (2 stars): I got this via delivery since I was craving noodles so might not be a right indicator of the actual dish. But it didn't taste like anything special, and I would've liked a better assortment of tempura.\n- Salmon sashimi appetizer (4 stars): Very smooth, but I usually let the bf eat all of this since it's his fave type of sashimi.\n\nAdditional pluses: I've never had to wait for a seat, and the prices are decent (prob can get out of here paying between $15-20/person). The restaurant provides free edamame beans before your meal (love it because I always feel cheated when places try to sell me a tiny plate of edamame for $5), and the waiters are super attentive in refilling tea.

I had heard great things about it, and while I am always skeptical about restaurants in the Castro I threw caution to the wind. Well the wind blew it back in my face.\n\nI decided to go all vegetarian, and luckily Takara has a very nice selection of vegetarian options. The Cucumber Sonomono was the first disappointment. The vinegar tasted as if it has been diluted with water, most of the cucumbers had not even been dipped in the vinegar let alone soaked in it. I actually had to pour soy sauce over it, to be able to eat it. The vegetable gyoza was the next item up, and they were perfectly prepared, golden and crisp on one side and the vegetables inside bursting with flavor. For my rolls I ordered the oshinko maki, and the vegetable dragon roll.\n\nThe oshinko was crisp and perfectly pickled, unfortunately the nori that it was wrapped in was stale and tough. The dragon roll was probably the highlight of the night. Well prepared, the nori was fresh, and the avocado and eggplant prepared with perfection.\n\nNow comes the worst experience in my restaurant life. The wait staff appeared to be on speed. I have never in my life felt so rush at a restaurant. No sooner did I place the last piece of food in my mouth, they were there snatching away the empty plate.

This place may try to look fancy but it is not up to par compared to other Japanese restaurants in the city. \n\nFirst, who sears O-toro especially when I ordered sashimi. If I wanted cooked fish I would order it. But I ordered sashimi and I expected a piece of raw fish but instead I end up with half cooked fish. Is there something wrong with it like maybe it was about to spoil thus you cooked it? After I ate my order of O-toro I began to wish I had not ordered it at all. It gave me a bad after taste and I felt it might have been spoiled because of the strong fishy smell, but not the good kind. Besides the O-toro I ordered Uni, which again is disappointing because the Uni looked pale yellow and is doused with soy sauce. I actually like my seafood nice and clean so the only garnish I really put on my raw seafood is a small dab of wasabi and that is IT. No soy sauce. So I was disappointed to see that the chef had put soy sauce over the uni. Another disappointment was that instead of one or two large pieces of uni placed over rice, I had small little bits almost what I consider the leftovers scraped off the bottom of the container stuffed on top of rice with some type of edible paper wrapped around it. It was utterly sad and I cannot start to describe the despair I felt when I saw it. But down the hatch it went and yeah, it really tasted like the dried up stuff scraped from the bottom of the container. \n\nBesides the disappointment I felt with the O-toro and the Uni there were a few items I was satisfied with. The third item I ordered was Amaebi. This looked a lot better and unlike other sushi restaurants the raw shrimp does come with the fried shrimp heads, which we felt unless they give you the fried shrimp heads with this dish then you are missing out. The shrimp heads were perfectly fried but of course they have trimmed its whiskers so there wasn't a lot of that to munch on. Our fourth dish was the Baked Mussels and is good and pretty standard compared to other Japanese restaurants with the exception of Sushi Zone, which does the Baked Mussels perfectly and above standard, well worth the wait. Our final dish was the raw oysters from Japan, the Shigoku oysters. These were good and I do recommend trying these. The oysters were clean, fresh, and sweet. They were garnished with a special sauce, fish eggs, and green onions. \n\nOverall, I will NOT be coming back. This is not my type of sushi restaurant where they mask the real flavors and colors of the seafood.

It looked attractive, but I heard mixed notices about the food. When she retired six years ago, it completely fell off my radar, and when it changed names, it might as well have entered the witness protection program. Then one night, I was at Curry Boyz right across the street and glanced over. Suddenly it looked inviting to me. It only took ten years. Par for the course for me. Anyway, Jamie W. and I finally made it here after checking out the new rainbow crosswalks at 18th and Castro.\n\nThey just opened for the evening, so they were just setting up for dinner. Naming the place Takara didn't help me remember me since it's a pretty common Japanese name. There's even a restaurant in J-Town with the same name. It's kinda like naming a place Sam's. Anyhow, it's mainly sushi though they have standard Japanese fare if you prefer something that's been near a stove. Our meal began with a $5.95 plate of Gyoza which were pretty well grilled and provided a satisfying start (photo: http://bit.ly/1xyaZmn). We segued into a $4.95 plate of Grilled Eggplant slices sprinkled with chopped scallions and accompanied by a ponzu dipping sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1tL62XB).\n\nGood, not mushy though a tad lukewarm. The sight of Ankimo on a menu always makes me excited like a little girl wearing her first training bra. So for $8.50, a plateful was in order, and it was just as fresh a piece of monkfish liver as I could hope for, nicely sliced and also accompanied by ponzu sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1IjkSpm). That was gone so quickly I'm surprised Jamie still has fingers. Then our main sushi order arrived on one plate. To accommodate Jamie's taste, we had the $5.95 King California Roll which contains real versus imitation crab, a worthwhile dollar surcharge for the real thing (photo: http://bit.ly/1xzGk7N).\n\nNothing really to say about the roll except that it was put together as expected and tasted fine for a California roll, I suppose.

It looked attractive, but I heard mixed notices about the food. When she retired six years ago, it completely fell off my radar, and when it changed names, it might as well have entered the witness protection program. Then one night, I was at Curry Boyz right across the street and glanced over. Suddenly it looked inviting to me. It only took ten years. Par for the course for me. Anyway, Jamie W. and I finally made it here after checking out the new rainbow crosswalks at 18th and Castro.\n\nThey just opened for the evening, so they were just setting up for dinner. Naming the place Takara didn't help me remember me since it's a pretty common Japanese name. There's even a restaurant in J-Town with the same name. It's kinda like naming a place Sam's. Anyhow, it's mainly sushi though they have standard Japanese fare if you prefer something that's been near a stove. Our meal began with a $5.95 plate of Gyoza which were pretty well grilled and provided a satisfying start (photo: http://bit.ly/1xyaZmn). We segued into a $4.95 plate of Grilled Eggplant slices sprinkled with chopped scallions and accompanied by a ponzu dipping sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1tL62XB).\n\nGood, not mushy though a tad lukewarm. The sight of Ankimo on a menu always makes me excited like a little girl wearing her first training bra. So for $8.50, a plateful was in order, and it was just as fresh a piece of monkfish liver as I could hope for, nicely sliced and also accompanied by ponzu sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1IjkSpm). That was gone so quickly I'm surprised Jamie still has fingers. Then our main sushi order arrived on one plate. To accommodate Jamie's taste, we had the $5.95 King California Roll which contains real versus imitation crab, a worthwhile dollar surcharge for the real thing (photo: http://bit.ly/1xzGk7N).\n\nNothing really to say about the roll except that it was put together as expected and tasted fine for a California roll, I suppose.

It doesn't cost much to remake two portions in the grand scheme of things - I was a server for a long time before and during college, and I would have never treated my guests like that.

These came out 40 minutes after we ordered, and everything was cold. Our friends ordered sushi, so I bet they just timed the food wrong and let it sit in the kitchen. \n\nWhen I let our server know the food was cold, she asked us if we wanted to reheat or remake the food. We said remake. When she came out with the food 10 minutes later, it was clear that the salmon teriyaki and saba shioyaki were reheated, and they didn't even touch to the cold tonkatsu.

If i'm sending food back a second time, there's no way I'm going to eat it anymore. I told her no thanks because I was starving.\n\nAt that point, I guess she felt bad (or that her tip was in jeopardy) so the kitchen sent us two fresh tonkatsus \"on the house\". Too little too late - 1) why didn't you just do this the first time the food was sent back!?!? and 2) the only reason they gave it to us \"on the house\" (oh thank you for your generosity) was because the server felt bad the second time, not even the first time.

It was empty when we arrived which made us a little nervous, but we decided to give it a shot. The restaurant did get significantly more crowded as it got a little later, but seems like at any time there's no wait for a table.\n\nThey brought out edamame and water as soon as we sat down which was nice. Then we had the kamikaze roll, x roll, salmon sashimi, and chicken udon.\n\nThe kamikaze roll was very good. I'm a big spicy tuna fan to begin with though! The x roll was also delicious, but I thought the sauce was overwhelming the rest of the roll. \n\nThe salmon sashimi was super fresh, it's clear the quality of the fish is really good. \n\nThe udon was fantastic too! The broth was amazingly flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The chicken in it was nothing to write home about. I'll probably try the beef next time. (Seafood is a little too adventurous for me...)\n\nService was just ok (hence just 4 stars instead of 5). Our waitress came by very quickly after we were seated and asked if we were ready to order. We told her we needed just another minute, but didn't see her for at least 10... Then, midway through our meal we overheard her telling the table next to us about some specials that weren't on the menu. We didn't hear about any specials...\n\nAlso, the water guy kept filling my glass. Literally every time I took a sip. It got to the point where it was actually disruptive to the conversation.\n\nI don't mean to end on a negative note because this is a solid sushi place with some inventive rolls, tasty fresh fish, and friendly servers.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-09-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Our staples are tokyo breeze, x roll, and maguro ngiri."], "author": "Ilana B.", "review": "This place is consistently good.
