"], "author": "Steph P.", "review": "Background:\nPast research by the principal investigator has demonstrated that consumption of cupcakes is significantly linked with feelings of euphoria and mild insanity (but the good kind). Additionally, field research in NYC has compared various cupcake purveyors (http://www.yelp.com/list_details?userid=DAf3UOAONCpgETWlNTERKg&list_id=SzFCtFQ2YOJxI54pxaUr3Q) and found Magnolia Bakery's cupcakes to be the frontrunner, described as \"HOT and MOIST and HEAVENLY\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/85x3dZCMBj4rJ2LAdW-wFg?hrid=4nvPmoOAzAzW7hJjlMIjWw)  However, there is currently a dearth of research addressing the Great Cupcake Debate in the Bay Area (by the present PI). Therefore, the present review represents one study in a multi-site, ongoing research project to determine the Bay Area's BEST CUPCAKE EVAR.\n\n\nMethod:\nThe site for Study #1 - Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Company. Samples included:\n1) Most-est Cake - popular among Yelp reviews, fashioned after the Hostess cupcakes;\n2) Z'nger cupcake -fashioned after Dolly Madison raspberry flavored, creme filled cakes;\n3) Carrot Cake cupcake - fashioned after...well, carrot cake;\n4) Asiago cheese loaf (ok, so it's not a cupcake, but my co-investigator was kind enough to give me some of her loaf so it's fair for review)\n\nResults:\nOMG!!! (and I mean that in the most scientific way possible). Eating these cupcakes is like discovering a completely new, moister, more delicious level of existence. Let's break it down by each independent variable with the dependent variable (DV) operationalized as Steph's level of euphoria (where 1 = I would rather eat dirt, and 10 = I  could die right now and not give a crap):\n\n1) Most-est - Biting into the chocolate ganache top gives way to moist, chocolate cake heaven. A second bite into the cupcake and negative memories of the nasty white pseudocream in Hostess Suzy-Q's and Twinkies dissipate as perfect portion of the fluffy, vanilla creme center melds together with the surrounding chocolate cake. A wonderful cupcake, but personal tastes favor frosting over ganache. DV = 8.5 \n\n2) Z'nger - If angels came in the form of cupcakes, they would probably taste something like this. Moist angel food cake, filled and topped with a delicate whipped creamlike frosting that is speckled with raspberry preserves and dusted with pink and white coconut flakes. DV =  10\n\n3) Carrot Cake - Perfectly constructed in sweetness, density, and incorporation of shredded carrot, raisins, and walnuts. The frosting is a traditional cream cheese frosting, but excecuted perfectly to achieve the ultimate balance of sweetness, lightness, and creaminess. Eating this evoked images of swimming in carrot cake. (I dunno?) Even my co-investigator, who doesn't like carrot cake, had to concede that this was a delight.  DV = 10\n\n4) Asiago Cheese Loaf - A sturdy bread with large chunks of savory asiago goodness running throughout. I would imagine this would be quite delicious served warm as a sandwich bread or as is. DV = 7\n\nDiscussion:\nWhile the present research did not incorporate the tasting of the plain chocolate or vanilla cupcakes(thus serving as a control in comparing against other bakeries), the intensity of the reactions formed suggest that Noe Valley Bakery is in the running for the best cupcakes in SF. It should also be mentioned that the next morning, these cupcakes were STILL moist and heavenly. The Asiago loaf also suggests that the bakery does a good job with savory items, though further research is needed for more confident results. Other observations worthy to note:  there is no seating in the bakery and few cafes nearby; plan ahead where you will be conducting your own research. At only $1.95 per cupcake, this is a great deal compared to some other places that offer gourmet cupcakes. This is located in Noe Valley, which is a pain in the ass for someone who lives in the Inner Richmond. But it is TOTALLY worth it. I will try to make more friends with cars just to have more of these cupcakes.\n\nConclusion:\nNoe Valley Bakery has some DAMN GOOD, affordable cupcakes! Dare I say...better than Magnolia?!?! The PI's conception of cupcakes has been turned upside down and requires further investigation. Future research is highly recommended to assure reliability and validity of findings...and to induce states of euphoria!", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-04-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Their whole wheat sandwich bread is a staple for me.

My son won't have anything to do with any part of the cupcake that has no icing, which cracks me up but also makes me a 'little' pissed off because I can't indulge in the moist cream cheese icing. \n\nI also saw their most-es cupcake which I will definitely try because it looks amazing.  I found a brief description of their most-ex cupcake (below) and can't wait to return to check it out. \n\nMost-es Cupcake:\nA childhood favorite.

They had the most delicious Asiago Cheese Bread...crusty cheese exterior...and a core of Asiago Cheese enlivening the delicious bread.  While we walked over to Ritual to partake of coffee and cupcakes, we managed to devour most of the Asiago Cheese Bread.  \n\nSteph was saying that she wished she could toast the bread.

My husband, son and I spent a weekday afternoon in Noe Valley to have lunch, pick up groceries and indulge in some dessert.  We walked all over 24th street and finally settled Noe Valley Bakery.

All of their desserts look amazingly good and the service is top notch.  \n\nI checked out the cakes, cookies and cupcakes and wanted to try every single one.  My son and I shared the red velvet cupcake.  By sharing, he ate the  cheese cream icing and I had the rest of the cupcake.  My son won't have anything to do with any part of the cupcake that has no icing, which cracks me up but also makes me a 'little' pissed off because I can't indulge in the moist cream cheese icing. \n\nI also saw their most-es cupcake which I will definitely try because it looks amazing.

The apricots are plump, soft, flavorful and plentiful and even though you can't see the ginger its flavor is definitely highlighted in the dense, moist bread.  I've been known to eat an entire loaf of this bread in one sitting.\n\nI often tell people that I like my cookies hard and crispy, but that doesn't mean I won't eat a cookie if it's soft and chewy.  Noe Valley Bakery's cookies are neither hard and crispy nor soft and chewy but more of something in between.  I've tried many of their cookie varieties so far, and they've all been good.

Back then, I thought I didn't like cupcakes, because one too many stale grocery store baked goods turned me off from cupcakes. Plus I thought cupcakes were more of a children's snack, maybe because of memories of school bake sales, or because they're individually wrapped in paper so kids don't have to use any forks or plates, or maybe because the decorations often look juvenile. Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Co. made me realize delicious cupcakes do exist, and I do like them! After I tried one, I paid the store a visit and became a repeat customer.\nThe bakery itself is on the small side. There are two display cases with cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pastries. Loaves of fresh bread are lined up on the shelves. There are also candles, cards, and dough to take home and bake yourself.\n\nAll the cupcakes are very rich, heavy, and moist. The icing is so creamy, smooth, and beautifully applied. They're pretty pricey, around $3.50-$4ish per cupcake, but they seem larger than most cupcakes. Some of them come in mini size. The filled ones cost a little more. To me, the taste is superior to most cupcakes. The cupcakes are very thick too. Cutting into one doesn't smush or deflate them.\n\nRed Velvet - deep, dark red cake. Perhaps they use less red food coloring than most. The cream cheese icing is thick and creamy, almost like cheesecake filling, but so much smoother than actually eating cheesecake.\n\nMost-est - their rendition of the Hostess with Bavarian cream & silky ganache\n\nChocolate Caramel Fleur de Sel - filled with caramel Bavarian cream, sprinkled with chunky sea salt. Sea salt is the best part, because it adds a savory component, and enhances the flavor. Otherwise, I wouldn't really like this one, as I'm not a fan of caramel. \n\nBoston Cream - vanilla cake filled with a pastry cream that resembles custard, topped with stiff fudge icing\n\nPeanut Butter Cup - a tiny peanut butter cup sits atop the cake covered in chocolate ganache, filled with more rich, creamy peanut butter. It's so rich, sweet, and savory.\n\nI'm not sure if they still have the Boston Cream or the PB cup, and that makes me sad, because I'm pretty sure they were my favorites. A few other things have changed, mostly in appearance. The lemon cupcake is no longer decorated with a bee on top. The carrot cupcake that had carrot-shaped icing is now replaced with shredded carrots on top. \n\nTheir cakes are great - simple in design, but big on taste. They are a little expensive at ~$40 for a small cake. The writing on the cake is done very well, almost font-like. Clearly, penmanship is important here. They do some pretty amazing-looking custom cakes too.\n\nI've tried some of the cookies, but they didn't stand out to me.

First of all I tried to email them, asking if I could provide my order via email.  This was a few days before my desired date.  No response.  So I figured to go in to make sure I can order and get it by that Saturday.  I went over my choices w/ my sales lady, and requested the \"Parisian\" trim, which costs an extra $4.  The day comes to pick it up; a Saturday, and mid-day Saturday on 24th Street is not always easy so I had my niece pick up the cake while I went around the block.  She said it looked good and we went on our merry way.   \n\nI get the cake home and only later to find the my Parisian trim wasn't done!  The cake, filling & frosting were fine.   I was pretty disappointed because the trim that was on there was (1) something that even I could've done and (2) wasn't even offered!  What happened?  Did the decorator do mine last and got lazy?  I later wrote an email about this to the email address provided on their website.  Only today, three and a half weeks later, did I even get any kind of response.\n\nI'd advise not to get the chocolate fudge frosting w/ the chiffon cake.  It was a bit too heavy to be on top of the cake.  It would be better off as a filling instead.  It was really good, like mouth-smacking because it was nice and thick!\n\nDon't ever try to email them about anything that has a time constraint. If they can't even respond to an email on time then they shouldn't provide it!  Also as a baker, details matter.  As minor a detail as what I wanted was, it still wasn't done and that is disappointing.\n\nSo despite the snafu, everything is a hit, from bread to cookies to cakes and tarts.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-10-28"}, {"excerpts": ["While I myself am not prone to infidelity, I feel that the red velvet cupcake here was my sloppy one night stand.
