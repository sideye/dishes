I don't think I've had this kind of quality Chinese food in a long time. We didn't order anything exquisite because we're not made out of money and that's just it. Average people food that taste excellent is just what people need more of these days. \n\nWe ordered a Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup, House Special Chicken (aka Empress Chicken), Salt and Pepper Spareribs, Fish and Tofu Claypot, and a Lotus Root and Baby Fish Stir-fry. You get what you ask for. They do not skimp on any of the ingredients and it was strictly no frills, solid, good food. \n\nThe crab meat in the soup tasted fresh and sweet; the chicken meat was tender and springy; the spareribs were lightly battered and salted perfectly; the claypot had literally only fish and tofu but it was full of what Chinese people call \"breath of a wok\" meaning it was piping hot; and the stir-fry was interesting but very delicious. \n\nS&T is a little bit more expensive than other restaurants but you get what you pay for. For an extra couple of bucks for each dish, I don't mind eating some quality food. I know everyone in the packed restaurant that night probably agreed with me too.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-02-24"}], "egg roll  pieces": [], "pot sticker  pieces": [], "minced squab wpine nut in lettuce wrap": [], "minced seafood wpine nut in lettuce wrap": [], "beef shank wspciy sauce": [], "roasted crispy squab": [], "crab meat  fish maw soup": [], "minced dry scallop  crab meat soup": [], "special minced dry scallop soup": [], "seafood  tofu soup wbamboo piths": [], "sweet corn  crab meat soup": [], "sweet corn  egg white soup": [], "house special wonton soup": [], "seafood soup wsizzling rice": [], "hot  sour soup": [], "combination mushrooms in clay pot": [], "braised bailing mushroom wsweet pea": [], "braised spinach wcombination eggs": [], "braised mustard green": [], "chinese broccoli wgarlic": [], "braised mustard green wmushroom": [], "spicy mabo tofu wminced pork": [], "fook kin style steamed tofu": [], "black pepper sauce tofu steamed wscallop": [], "pan fried string bean": [], "fried tofu with vegetables": [], "house special panfried crisp noodle": [], "seafood panfried crisp noodle": [], "beef pan fried crisp noodle wtomato": [], "beef chow fun in black bean sauce": [], "spareribs chow fun in black bean sauce": [], "beef  spinach chow fun wshrimp paste": [], "beef  perserved vegetable chow fun": [], "singapore style spicy vermicelli": [], "malaysian spicy chow fun": [], "thai style spicy thread vermicelli": [], "braised noodle wdry scallop  enoki mushroom": [], "braised shredded chicken emein wchive": [], "mabo seafood  tofu emein": [], "crab meat emein wmushroom": [], "dry scallop fried rice wegg white": [], "minced beef fried rice wbasil  egg white": [], "fook kin fried rice": [{"excerpts": ["They made the fook kin fried rice pretty good, though."], "author": "Edmond T.", "review": "Serviceable.
