The salmon mousse was light and airy, and had some subtle flavors (a little spicy, a little sour, not too fishy), and came with deliciously seasoned and buttered crispy bagel chips.\nStrawberry shortcake doughnuts with shortcake crumble, rhubarb jam, and vanilla cream ($8): these were delicious! The doughnuts were hot and just out of the fryer, and packed on the inside with tart rhubarb jam and dusted on the outside with sugar. I also really liked the vanilla cream on the side.\nThe burger ($16): the burger was large and filling. The meat was juicy and while it didn't have the the usual accompaniments (lettuce, tomato, onion), if had some sort of slaw and mayo-based dressing that was quite delicious. The tater tots were stuffed with bacon and cheese and came with a ranch dressing. Definitely not healthy, but tasty!\nPastrami hash with shishito peppers, corn, poached eggs, and mustard creme fraiche ($17): the hash was very tasty. It came with two poached eggs which had runny yolk (just the way I like them), and the hash itself wasn't too greasy, although it was a little watery.\n\nOverall we had a good time, even though the power went out in the middle of our meal.

I already heard great things about them from fellow yelper reviews, so when I saw that they had a booth at the 2014 San Francisco Street Food Festival, it was a perfect opportunity to try their famous Puffed Potato & Egg (http://bit.ly/1mVorYv).  Luckily for me, they didn't have a line and after that first bite of their Puffed Potato & Egg, I was hooked and went back and ordered it again at least twice that day.  It was so good!  And with that, I knew I wanted to give their restaurant a try.  The timing for it was actually perfect since I took a huge gamble and decided to try Stones Throw as the venue for Janice C.'s birthday brunch party for a group of 15 folks.\n\nBefore we get to the food, first off, I want to say that communication was really great with Tai Ricci and their staff to help plan for the event.  Even though I had to call them several times to change the head count, they were very patient and accommodating.  Amazing customer service!  Like what all past reviews have stated, get a reservation!!  Even though we had one, the place got packed just a short while after opening.\n\nWhat was great about having a big group was that aside from their oysters and burger, we basically got to try the whole brunch menu in family style form.  Not a bad deal for $25 per guest (for groups of 8 or more it's the minimum before drinks, tax, and gratuity).\n\nFood Gallery:\n\nSmoked Salmon Mousse --  http://bit.ly/XjHVzM\nMilk Jam, Strawberry Compote, Balsamic\n\nVanilla-Sugar Doughnuts --  http://bit.ly/1D8jBSj\nBagel Chips, Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, Scallions\n\nPuffed Potato & Egg --  http://bit.ly/1D8jHZX\nCauliflower Mousse, Crispy Bacon\n\nButter-Fried Pancake --  http://bit.ly/1D8jK87\nEuropean-Style Butter, Vermont Maple Syrup\n\nBrioche Pain Perdu --  http://bit.ly/XjIyt1\nYellow Peaches, Vanilla Cream, Salted Almonds\n\nBrown Butter Crepes --  http://bit.ly/1D8jQwH\nNutella, Banana, Mascarpone, Shaved Hazelnuts\n\nBrokaw Avocado & Burrata Salad --  http://bit.ly/XjIJEF\nLa Quercia Prosciutto, Sungold Tomatos, Serpent Cucumbers\n\nRolled Chino Valley Farms Omelette --  http://bit.ly/XjIPMA\nOven-Dried Tomato, Button Mushroom, Herbed Goat Cheese, Brioche Crumble\n\nRoasted Corn & Duck Confit Hash --  http://bit.ly/XjIWYo\nPoached Eggs, Jimmy Nardello Peppers, Red Onion, Corn Bread\n\nIn all essence, everything we had was delicious and plated very nicely despite being served family style.

As the area would dictate, parking is kind of crazy, but we were able to find a spot a couple of blocks away, so we walked in early, and already in a good mood.  We were warmly welcomed, and seated immediately.  When you have a toddler, quick service is kind of a big deal.  It's a pretty new spot, I think, so the high chairs were brand new, and our little guy didn't fuss much about sitting in the seat.  They don't have a kid's menu, but we asked if they could offer a kid's portion for some of the dishes, and they were accommodating with the pancake, which sounded pretty good to me and my husband.\n\nThey have an interesting and extensive beer list (not every beer, but it's well curated, and give a nice set of options for any flavor profile you'd want), and the cocktail I had was excellent.\n\nWe got 2 small plates to start. Their infamous potato and egg puffs, and the smoked salmon mousse. My toddler son went nuts for the salmon mousse.

Everyone was happy with the food.  My son can be a bit of a picky eater, but breakfast is usually his favorite. He can polish off a normal pancake, or a square of waffle, but he had 3/4 of one of the butter-fried pancakes. He sat there, popping bites into his mouth, and asking for me to cut more over and over.  We thought he'd get through half, and he just kept going. These are not small pancakes!  It was about 3/4\" thick, and about 7\" wide.  He looked like a contestant who knew he was going to lose in an eating contest, but he had to keep going.\n\nThe hash was excellent. More than anything, the quality of their eggs were great.  The breakfast sandwich was even better than the hash.

They suggested we take an Uber and if we did, it would be 5% off our entire meal!  Woaaa that is sooo cool!  We opted not to take Uber, only because we had several errands we had to run that day.  We will definitely take them up on that offer when we have dinner there.  And trust me, after that brunch... we will have many dinners there.\n\nReservations were at a decent time, 11:30!!

I found out that same night that he was wanting to try this restaurant for some time, and he thought a \"last supper\" with the family was a good reason for an inaugural visit.\n\nAnd about that STONE being unturned, I guess in this case the STONE would be a metaphor for the menu.  My advice:  peruse the menu carefully as there are certainly many appetizing dishes to choose from.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy, yet elegant and simply decorated.  Though we were slightly early for our reservation, the host extended a warm welcome and showed our group of five to our table.\n\nSome of the group did their due diligence in researching (via Yelp) the more popular or well-known dishes.  However, their menu has many appetizers, entrees, etc. to choose from, as well as an extensive wine and spirits list.\n\nFOOD:  Thanks to some helpful recommendations via Yelp, our group chose a variety of appetizers to share, these included the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate & mousse, and the squid ink pasta.  \n\nFirstly, do order the puffed potato and eggs and the squid ink pasta.  All of the accolades from other yelpers are indeed true.  The potato and eggs are fluffy, light and delicious, while the pasta delivers bold flavors thanks to the seafood combination of calamari, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The duck pate and mousse was alright, and I'd recommend asking for more bread if needed.  \n\nMy dinner entree was the butternut squash ravioli.  It was simply divine.  Cheesey goodness is more like it actually.  Although the portion was smaller than I anticipated, the gnnochi was excellent.  The brussels sprout pesto, truffle, and sage complemented the ricotta gnudi splendidly.  In contrast, my mother ordered the trout, accompanied with brussels sprouts, celery root and beef jus.  She liked it every much, as evident by her finishing almost the entire portion.\n\nI think the entree our table was most in awe of was the burger, or \"DA BURGA\" as its aptly named on the menu.  This entree is of gargantuan proportions and is every bit as mouthwatering as it looks.....from what I was told by my two tablemates that ordered this behemoth burger.  The burger bun is equally just as thick as the meat that sits between the two pieces, which barely contained the melted cheddar cheese that slowly trickled onto the plate.  And its companion?  Not just your ordinary fries, but baked potato tator tots.  I was able to try a tator tot, and after doing so I began to doubt my original decision to order the gnnochi.  I suppose a second visit is in order on a future trip to the bay area.\n\nSWEET TREAT:  To end the meal, we all shared the peanut butter and jelly donuts.  For all my Hawaii friends and family on Yelp, this is basically the bay area's version of malasadas.  The generous portion of jelly within the donut was, of course, a fantastic combination with the peanut butter and truly brought back fond childhood memories.  A comfort food and dessert rolled into one.  \n\nSERVICE:  Outstanding.  Our server was a friendly and humorous woman who was extremely patient with our group, and took the time to answer all our questions to the best of her ability.  She kindly offered recommendations on appetizers, entrees, and cocktails.  She checked on us in a timely during the entire meal and provided excellent customer service.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  An incredible meal with wonderful friends and family.

We left the house a little bit early in fear that parking was going to be hard.  It can be, especially on Hyde St., but thankfully Stones Throw has teamed up with Uber.  Instead of having to worry about parking, Uber it and show your receipt to your server, 5% will be taken off your bill.  Not only is that one great way to accommodate your customers, the hostess literally walked outside and welcomed us into the restaurant even before they were opened for service.  The staff all felt that it was too chilly to be outside so although they were still setting up some things, they wanted us to be indoors.  Totally a nice gesture on their part that will be ingrained in my head - we got to stay warm and preview the bar while looking through the menu.  If you are into beers, you will definitely appreciate their  extensive selection.  \n\nNot only was the front of the house super warm and welcoming, our server Danielle was amazing too!  Super cheerful and friendly, she's the exact person to help bring a smile to anyone's face.  She was very attentive all throughout our brunch, constantly filling our waters and checking if she could get us anything.\n\nSimplicity is the key to this successful eatery.  Their brunch menu is not too extensive, but they keep things simple by focusing on a few small bites, some savories, and a few sweets.  Thanks to the recommendations of Cherylynn N., we started with the Puffed Potato & Egg and boy, they were insanely delicious (thanks Cherylynn!).  I'm usually not a fan of egg yolks either, but the techniques in preparing this dish made us yearning for more!  The chefs not only managed to get the yolk oozy delicious, but the outer layer on the potato had the right amount of crispiness.  \n\nWe also ordered \"da burga\" with tater tots and the asparagus w/ duck confit hash which were both just a tasty.

Da burga was cooked to perfection, we asked for it to be medium and that was def. what we received, one juicy well seasoned burger.  The tater tots accompanied with it is just as amazing!  Bacon, sour cream, and chives blended into each tater tot as if I was biting into a loaded potato.\n\nTo balance out the savories, we opted for the spiced pumpkin doughnuts with pumpkin butter as our dessert.  The doughnuts were light and fluffy and resembled a lot like beignets.  I'm nowhere close to being a pumpkin fan like my husband, but even I liked it.  It's not often that he finishes his dessert either but when he does, you know it's a great dessert.  The pumpkin butter was a nice touch, he only wished there was more of it and maybe have it filled inside each doughnut.   \n\nLook no further, stop by Stones Throw for either Sunday Brunch or a nice dinner, you will not be disappointed!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-03-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We got the Duck Pate & Mousse, Puffed Potato & Egg, Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear, \"Da Burga\", the duck breast, and the apple pie.

We will definitely take them up on that offer when we have dinner there.  And trust me, after that brunch... we will have many dinners there.\n\nReservations were at a decent time, 11:30!!  We show up about 25 minutes early, because we're always early.  Luckily they have availability and seat us immediately.  We ordered:\n\n** PITCHER OF PIMM'S :: 4/5 stars :: for $20, it's a pretty good deal.  And normally I'd say a pitcher for $20 is a great deal, but the pitcher was FULL of ice and the glasses they brought to pour the PIMM'S in was also full of ice... so it was a bit deceptive.  But it was very refreshing and great compliment to brunch\n** SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE sans scallions :: 5/5 stars :: so much flavor!  mousse was extremely smooth and the pickled items they added complimented the mousse w/o overpowering it.  I think they also added fried capers, which I love!  It added another level of texture.  The bagel chips were a bit hard, I was worried about my teeth on a couple bites!  :D\n** DUCK CONFIT HASH :: 5/5 stars :: I don't even know where to begin. This was AHHHH-mazing!  I don't even want to describe it, I know I can't do it justice!  Only one other thing to note, I don't even like English peas, but they made me like it!\n** \"DA BURGA\" aka DA DISASTER :: 5/5 stars :: everything was perfect, from the great sauces all the way down to the ooey gooey of the cheese melting down the sides of the patty!  Probably my favorite burger in the city for now.\n\nStaff was friendly and perfectly attentive.  I love this place and can't wait to come back for dinner!

Scraped the plate clean.\n- Octopus Okonomiyaki - the Okonomiyaki Pancake was divine, but the octopus was slightly over-charred for our liking. Nevertheless, we still inhaled it.\n- The Chicken Main Course - so good.

Stones Throw is just the most recent addition to this list and, for the most part, it stands triumphant.\n\nThe decor is ultra-minimal (feels like an art gallery without the art), the atmosphere is intimate yet lively, and the service is INCREDIBLE. Perhaps it's just the honeymoon stages of a new restaurant (before exhaustion and tenure lead to jaded indifference), but every employee that we came into contact with was cheerful, friendly, and absolutely on-point. Even the busboys were chatting up a storm with us, asking us our favorite dishes thus far and adding in their recommendations. I'll call out our server, Dave L, specifically, because he was awesome -- our wine and water glasses were always filled; his food descriptions were excellent; and he was honest with us about a couple of dishes to avoid for the night (which I always appreciate).\n\n-----------------------------\nFOOD:\n\nPuffed Potato & Egg = GREAT. Nice crisp, delicious subtle flavor.\n\nDuck Pate w/ Pretzel = GREAT. Smooth and creamy pate, nice salty touch from the pretzel.\n\nSquid Ink Pasta = EXCELLENT. Never had squid ink pasta shells (it's usually in spaghetti or paella form), but this is amazing for squid ink lovers.\n\nGrilled Octopus = GOOD. Good flavor but wasn't grilled enough. I prefer the grilled octopus at Mason Pacific.\n\nPork Belly Salad = EXCELLENT. Perfectly cooked crispy pork belly with a nice sweet kick from the pickled onions.\n\n\"Da Burga\" with Loaded Tater Tots = EXCELLENT. Love the oily brioche bun; the meat was a juicy and perfectly-cooked medium rare; and the loaded tater tots were addicting as hell.\n\nGrilled Rib-Eye = OKAY. This was the one truly disappointing dish of the night -- the rib eye wasn't very tender and the flavors were actually pretty boring. I wish I had listened to my gut and went with the duck that everyone raves about.\n\n-----------------------------\nDESSERTS:\n\nI was on the fence with the desserts because even though I understand and appreciate their idea of adding a fancy twist to old childhood favorites, some of them just didn't really work. \n\nIn particular, the \"Not Your Grandma's Apple Pie\" is a complete deconstruction and then molecular gastronomic reconstruction of \"apple pie\" -- so instead of a warm, crumbly apple pie, it's a cold apple-flavored pot de creme with a crispy wafer roll. It wasn't that the flavors weren't good (they were), but it's just not what I was expecting and I think the dessert is done a disservice by being compared to an apple pie.\n\nThe PB&J donuts were good, but the donuts weren't airy enough. The Oatmeal Cream Pie didn't really stick out as memorable either -- it just tasted like an overly-sweet... well yeah... Oatmeal Cream Pie.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nStones Throw has the potential to be one of the best American Contemporary restaurants in SF. It has the talent, the service, the menu, and actually quite reasonable prices. If it weren't for the Rib Eye and the strangely uninspired desserts, I would've easily given this place a resounding 5 stars.
