However, he persisted and repeated \"no egg, no dairy, no shrimp, no fish, no animal at all\" - and he did get vegan pad thai. He rated it mediocre. For my part, I had duck noodle soup which was quite tasty.

I thought that was odd; I 've been \"yelping\" for years and never been censored, and the reason I tried Bai Thong Thai was because of good reviews on Yelp. So if i give it 2 stars, it's not because Yelp \"bullied\" me, it's because they deserved it.\n\nI had a 5 PM dinner reservation; when they open. There was one couple ahead of me, who were seated by a window. There were several small tables available by windows, which are considered the better seats, but I was seated interior. It's not a huge deal, food is primary, and maybe I'm being over-sensitive but many places do treat solo customers, especially women, as less.\n\nBut food is primary. I ordered Angel Wing, Tom Yum soup (vegetarian) and Roast Duck over rice.\n\nWings were best, although not at all crispy, good taste. The soup was overwhelmingly sour. Thai food is supposed to be more balanced. But it would have been a good palate cleanser/sinus clearer between courses. Except halfway down the bowl was a huge wedge of raw, pallid, flavorless, out of season tomato. Not traditional and added nothing to the soup. Duck is a fatty meat, but has lean parts. This duck was fatty, not very flavorful, and sparse; the dish was mostly rice.\n\nThen they brought the check without asking if I wanted dessert, a big no-no. I asked for vanilla ice cream, I had thought about coconut but figured I'd stick with the most basic thing that no one could goof up. The ice cream was in a pretty blue dish with a swirl of chocolate. It was FULL of big ice crystals. That happens when ice cream partially thaws and is re-frozen. Aside from aesthetics, it left me concerned about their food storage habits. \n\nIronically, after earlier trying to hustle me out, when I did finish I had to wait a long time for check, finally had to wave the wait person down.\n\nFind myself agreeing with Michelle N who said same prices a Lers Ros but with worse food and service.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-01-30"}], "tuna tartar": [], "bai thong crab flower": [], "grilled isan sausage": [], "giant wing": [], "larb tofu salad": [], "san francisco giant soup": [], "pirate treasure soup": [{"excerpts": ["I got the pad Thai with chicken and the pirate treasure soup.
