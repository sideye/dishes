I was prepared all night to give the Pinecrest Diner at 401 Geary st a 5 star rating - the food was great (I love greasy diners), the staff EXTREMELY friendly and hospitable, the service punctual, informative and professional. So what's the one star for? Well, I'm a first-time visitor here in San Francisco. I just got off a 2 thousand mile Greyhound journey delayed by Texas blizzards and tornadoes (and I therefore probably do look a bit pasty). I had already spent a night at a hotel and I didn't want to spend more money on another night - so I thought I would kill two birds, checking out a 24 hr diner in town, while also working on a little writing and reading until my City bus tour at 11am. (And yes, I had a red gym bag with my belongings inside it - but I explicitly asked the host, before I sat down, whether this was welcome - and he told me it was OK!)\n\nBut because I'm not some bum who squats in businesses, I ordered about 30$ worth of food and drink throughout the night and tipped something like 22% (but maybe that's a low tip here in SF? Where I'm from that's considered mildly generous - I would have tipped more had I realized). And I was at pains to tell my waiter (who, from overhearing their conversation, I later found out is a rookie) and his co-workers several times throughout the night that, since I was alone, if they ever needed that table for a bigger party (there is limited space here - a fact about which I was conscious and considerate) they need only say so, and I would move back to the counter; that I was willing to order more food (and I said this in response to whispered comments I had overheard between the waiter and his superior about my not having already ordered more food - BUT THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I WAS ASSURED BY THE PRECEDING SHIFT THAT THIS WAS UNNECESSARY - AND THEN I WAS ASSURED *ONCE AGAIN* BY MY WAITER, AFTER I OFFERED TO ORDER MORE FOOD AND SHOWED HIM MY MASTERCARD, THAT IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO ORDER MORE FOOD **AND THAT I WAS WELCOME TO STAY**) or even leave, if there was a problem with my hanging out like that. And I deliberately chose what is probably their worst table so I would not be a nuisance. (And I saw a homeless man practically bathing himself at a better-placed table by the window around 3am -  he wasn't given so much as an awkward glance, let alone the treatment I eventually received.) \n\nEverything was FINE until the shift-change came (and if it is their policy that overnight guests must leave before the shift-change then WHY THE FUCK was I not told beforehand?) and some balding, pink-shirted *ASSHOLE* - avoid this man at all costs if you do not want your Pinecrest experience spoiled; I was not the only person he was needlessly rude to (but I repeat: he was the exception not the rule) - abruptly walks up to me (I had already been planning to leave soon after ordering a coffee and breakfast to go) and says, you need to leave now because you're not ordering food. Then I say, but I did order food - and I was about to say that I'm perfectly willing to order more food, or even offer another tip to the waiters for being so great throughout the night - but before I could speak he cut me off and said, well that was 5 hours ago (NOT true - I had ordered a 15$ meal right before breakfast around 5 or 6am) and I want you out of here right now. He said this loudly, and rudely, in front of the ENTIRE diner. NEVER so embarrassed in my life. I was COMPLETELY stunned. It was NOT my fault, if overnight guests are not appreciated, that I was misinformed by some pasty-haired rookie and ignoramus.  I'm so angry right now I cannot keep my hands from shaking. I am now, and have been for about an hour, sitting across the street at Jack in the Box where no one has even looked at me funny for not ordering anything yet (though I will be ordering coffee and a Danish before I leave - BECAUSE I'M NOT A BUM) wishing I had come to this cheesy franchise instead of trying out what had been a very cool diner. \n\nIf someone from this business happens to come across this review and would like to offer an apology or at least a f****** explanation for this extraordinary treatment  today then I will duly reconsider this review and my rating - but unless and until that happens I will NEVER AGAIN come within a mile of this dump and I will warn off anyone who will listen.\n\n(And yes, I understand they have to be wary of homeless people. But considering how I payed, and the fact that I had a  highly priced smartphone - which they AGREED to charge for me - and a few relatively expensive articles of clothing - NOT trying to boast - I cannot fathom how I could possibly have been mistaken for a down-and-out. But anyway, WHY WASN'T I ASKED? I could very easily have shown that I am a tourist with spending money - which was one of the reasons I needed my phone charged. So that I could reload my MasterCard.

The sampler platter consisted of; chicken fingers, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. All one color, dark brown. There was one point where I  couldn't tell the difference between the chicken and cheese sticks. This still tasted, OK. I mean it's fried cheese, typically a solid choice. \n\nThe chili cheese fries on paper looked great, in person not so much. Hardly any cheese, tons of beans, and almost no meat. This also tasted like the room smelled. Yowza.   \n\nMy phone died before I could snap any pics of the food, but would avoid this place if you can.

But the pancakes. God, the pancakes. I was nearly delirious with exhaustion and the pancakes stabbed a fork through my stomach.\n\nThe service seemed to be strangely poor towards me and my friend. It was at least ten minutes until we were asked by a busboy for drinks, and he couldn't take our our actual orders (ten minutes is quite a long time to decide for breakfast). Another five minutes went by until the actual server brusquely came over. Other people (like the people sitting behind us) somehow got near-immediate service, so I'm not sure what was up with that.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the people seem to be decent. I left a bag of things I bought from Black Friday, and when I ran back ten minutes later, the server calmly pointed me to behind the counter, where she had stashed it.\n\nStill a disappointing experience.", "rating": 2, "date": "2012-12-03"}, {"excerpts": ["But if you do want simple food, at an ok price, served up relatively quick, near Union Square, you could do worse than Pinecrest Diner.\n\n"], "author": "Adam T.", "review": "Not the fanciest food, or the most flavorful.

The passenger had him drive up to Washington Street, where he was paid for the trip in a currency of hot lead.\n\nThere are some that believe that the Zodiac ate here before he took the cab ride of infamy. Local legend says that for years, a zodiac message could be seen in the basement. This may or may not be true, as that I did see something that could either be by the murderer or just someone with a warped sense of humor. In either case, it was painted over a few months later. As a matter of fact, any Zodiac-related graffiti, especially in the men's bathroom is a sure-fire way to get them to paint the walls practically overnight.\n\nBut make no doubt about, just because SF's most infamous free-lance executioner might have patronized this establishment does not mean that you or anyone outside of being an insane masochist should dine here. Here's why:\n\n1. Wait staff with bad attitudes.\nI don't know if it's the borderline location to both the Tenderloin and Union Square, but if you look the least bit \"alternative\" (aka freakish), chances are, your service will be slow to non-existent. Don't expect service with a smile. Forced endurance with a scowl would be a closer descriptive, as the waitress tosses the menu practically at you (if you ever get that far).\n\n2. Bland to mediocre cooking.\nI guess the theater crowd, who seem to be the only people who keep this farce of a diner from going under, either have no food taste, or will eat anything when they are food-slumming after a show. In either case, the food is bland, generic, and far overpriced.\n\n3. Sanitary Conditions.\nWhile vermin aren't noticeable, other factors are. Let's just say that cleanup policies are \"relaxed.\" The last time I stopped in, most of the tables were in dire need of being cleared off and/or wiped down, and remained that way the entire meal.\n\nSo if you must stop in, be it for Zodiac folklore or for  the kitchen poached-egg murder, just order a soft-drink, better yet a cup of coffee, or tea or something that's been boiled.

Cooking hash browns, home fries, hash, and the like are not easy to do. This crew was on point! The omelet was full, the hash browns were crisped to perfection, and the bacon... oooooh the bacon. Too many places skimp out on good bacon to save a few pennies while still charging a premium because of the word \"bacon\". This place is not the case. Not only was it thick and perfect, they laid the bacon on top of the hash browns occasionally. This did two things. First, prevented the bacon from over cooking and drying out. Second, the bacon grease helped season the hash browns. The whole process was a science. These guys were maestros of the spatulas. Oh by the way... there was a full house, a line out the door, and I got served in about 5 minutes after ordering. I was stunned.
