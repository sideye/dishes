They were both hungover and struggling.  There was no warm \"hello\" or any kind of welcoming introduction.  A lady was asking questions about sauces on a plate and the short blonde flippantly responded with \"What sauce do you want?\"  I didn't say anything, but internally, I was like \"WOW!\"  I definitely took notice of her attitude and made sure I said \"please\" and \"thank you\" during every interaction so I wouldn't be on the receiving end of all that.\n\nI used to work across the street and have been here before - mainly HH.  The place was clean and looked the part.\n\nMy star rating:\n\n4 for the business - food is ok.  Not bad, but not worth traveling across town for.\n\n2 for the staff.

Then we all perform \"Riverdance\" for all the bedazzled tavern onlookers. Yes, it's true. OK, no, it's not. But I have actually passed by the Chieftain many, many times walking to the Yerba Buena Gardens. It just looked like a typical Irish-style bar. To my utter lack of surprise, I went in there last weekend with Jamie W...and guess what? It's a typical Irish-style bar. With food. \n\nYes, we ate there. They actually have quite a menu there that stretches beyond the standard definition of pub grub. But I have to say the quality doesn't rise much above pub grub either. Jamie W. had the $11.25 Battered Fish & Chips. They use Harp Irish lager for the batter and serve three generous fillets of cod. Good stuff...wish I ordered it. I went for the ambitious, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink $11.95 Chieftain Irish Grill - a 4-ounce grilled steak, a banger (sausage), a lamb patty, baked beans, sauteed mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, fries, and country gravy. Whew. \n\nWell, I was ready to be embarrassed by what came out, but it turned out to be a major glop-fest on a plate. Everything was covered with the gravy - so I couldn't tell what was what. I pointed out to the waitress that I didn't see my lamb \"slider\" since I was fully expecting a mini-burger on a bun. Well, she came back with a patty - and I later realized I already had a patty on the plate. Now I see on their online menu, they say \"lamb patty\". Did I cause that change? You can thank me later. \n\nNone of it was bad, but the combo of meat and gravy and whatever came across like a meal you'd see in the mess hall of a military base. I don't know if I'd come back to the Chieftain for their food, but I do need a place to practice my step-dancing now.

It's just a couple blocks down 5th on the corner across from Burlington Coat Factory.\n\nFirst thing you notice walking in, is how small the place is. There's one booth, several low tables with chairs, a few high tables with chairs, a community bar table in the middle and the bar seating itself. It looks like when this place is packed it's very \"intimate\". Lighting was very dim. Typical bar lighting. Also, try to look up at the walls & columns, they've done a pretty good job making the walls & columns look like rock and the torch lighting on the columns.\n\nWe sat at a table and the waitress came up to us and asked us if we wanted menus. She took our beer orders right away and gave us time to look over their menu. We immediately went to the Traditional section of the menu. By great yelp reviews we had to try the Potato Bites. From there we ordered the Fish & Chips and the Shepherd's Pie, especially since it said it was made with ground lamb, NOT ground turkey or ground beef like many other places.\n\nOn to the food...\nSpicy Potato Bites - Mashed potato balls with chopped jalape\u00f1os, deep fried and served with a spicy dipping sauce. You get 5 servings. You bite into one and the outside is light & crunchy, while the inside is what you expect, creamy mashed potato with bits of jalapeno. Just a little heat, but dip them in the sauce & you'll get a little more spice.

My fish came out hot & crispy, very light crisp. The fish was flaky, cooked just right. And I consider myself lucky this time because I got 4 pieces instead of 3, like it says on the menu. The chips were your basic steak fries, I didn't find anything really wow about them.\n\nPhoto - Fish & Chips: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-chieftain-irish-pub-and-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zIvLr0z2RVniJ7RxdEmT3g#zVMBCqjlmctWfRitrxze5A\n\nShepherd's Pie - You can definitely taste the difference with this one. Came to us really hot. So hot we had to let it cool down a bit. You can actually taste the lamb, it had that light gamey taste that only lamb has. It wasn't ground turkey or ground beef. The spices were nothing we've tasted in any other Shepherd's Pie. Very flavorful.\n\nPhoto - Shepherd's Pie: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-chieftain-irish-pub-and-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zIvLr0z2RVniJ7RxdEmT3g#7A77tHtv-UF27D10eJX2xA\n\nThey have daily special's too.

They give you a large, pretty varied menu at your table and the waitresses are friendly. The spacing of the tables is also pretty nice - you're not knocking into each other. It's probably my favorite place to watch a game and get a nice draft beer; they have quite a large selection including cocktails and wine for the beer-nonenthusiasts out there (confession: sometimes I get wine or cocktails instead; cocktails are okay but they use smaller ice which sometimes melts too quickly for my liking - I want to sip and enjoy the game...). People are generally around the late 20s and early 30s crowd and typically pretty into the game, but it's never rowdy enough that you can't hold a conversation. Just occasional extremely loud cheers. \n\nOnto the food:\n* Turkey burger: Tastes relatively light but delicious. There's jalapeno salsa and melted cheese. Comes with a small side of thick fries. \n* Buffalo wings: Not overly buffalo-ed, which I love.

Would have been slammin' with some ground lamb or sausage bits... the shepherd's pie was sensational with layers of flavor and great soda bread and butter. The Reuben Sandwich had pastrami that was less salty than most deli versions, yet had a deep beefy flavor. Awesome--it was served with crisp kraut that was probably brined then fermented. The lamb burger was juicy, and rich with crumbled blue. The fries were hot, fluffy and well seasoned. Heck, even the raw red onions were a bit sweet! The Corned Beef with Cabbage looked very plain... but the corned beef was really quite yummy!\n\nThrow in the $100 for $75 deal and this place is even more awesome!\n\nEveryone present was thrilled with the meal and eager to return.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-02-03"}, {"excerpts": ["i tried their Irish Nachos...
