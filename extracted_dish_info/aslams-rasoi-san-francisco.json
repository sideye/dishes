The staff is really warm/friendly, and authentic, this ain't no Mission Chinese with Caucasian hipster waiters. The location is awesome, if you're bougey like me you can park in the garage on 21st without leaving the sidewalk (or take the BART and walk over to Valencia if Uber pool is too rich for your blood)\n\nFood Commentary:\nAs an Asian yuppie who has eaten my fair share of Indian, I learned there are 5 things you can always safely order at an Indian joint... 1) chicken tikka masala 2) tandoori chicken 3) samosas 4) garlic naan 5) saag paneer (not sure if its served here)... I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

If you want to take your date or eat somewhere nice and quiet, you should probably come here. \n\n1) The naan servings are too small. \nThey give you a small Naan that basically makes you require ordering two Naan per person just to eat your meal with a proper side.

I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

And the food! I've never had a clunker here, and I've tried paneer, chicken, lamb, fish, different kinds of naan, rice, etc... The mango lassi is the best I've ever had, and my favorite food items are the goat cheese naan, the garlic naan, the fish pakoras, and the lamb rogan josh, which is always tender and never gamey. Even my dad, who normally isn't a big fan of Indian food, loved this; it's not your typical greasy Indian buffet fare.  What's more, half the time I've been here, they've brought some little dessert treat with the check, which always makes me feel welcome. It's been great for my vegetarian friends as well, for what it's worth (although most Indian places are!).  It's a little pricier than some other good Indian places in the area, but I think that the food here is noticeably better, the atmosphere is really cute, and the service is top notch; you get what you pay for! Give it a try, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and definitely my favorite Indian food in the Bay.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-04-02"}, {"excerpts": ["To make up for it, our server brought us tasty Mango Lassi shots.

We split the samosas and pakora but at least I can say I walked away knowing the pakora was good, can't really say the samosa impressed me.\n\nWe ordered the chana masala, lamb korma, and half tandoori chicken all at medium (we asked for pepper on the side). The food came out without the pepper on the side so my roommate who adores hot foods had to wait and the waitress had to be reminded to bring it out. I am generally not a fan of tandoori chicken but it was well prepared, tender, and overall good. Chana masala was decent with some good notes to it but I was sort of sad with the lamb korma. That plate came out with a few pieces of lamb which made us all wonder what would have happened if we did individual plates (someone would be starving). The korma itself was bland so I was grateful when the pepper arrived to give it that extra push.\n\nOn the bright side the waitress was accommodating when we requested wine and brought two tasters for us to decide upon.

I rocked the Karahi Gosht this time but like the lamb dish I got better the first time around. OH, try to sit in the windows because people watching is AWESOME and there are plenty of people to watch and make faces at on Valencia.\n\nI went here on Saturday out of curiosity and came out pleasantly surprised. There was a bit of a wait since there was a large party in the restaurant and I was hungry as hell after walking to Palace Steak House only to find out it was closed for Thanksgiving. Bullshit! But back to the review ....\n\nThere was a slight wait, which irritated me, but it was well worth it after the food came out. Our waitress was a daughter of the chef and we just asked her to bring us her favorite dishes. We ended up with the lamb curry (first lamb dish on the menu) and the chicken shish kebab. Both of them were super tasty and crazy delicious with mad props thrown down on the chicken. We kicked things off with the samosa, pompadour and fritter(?) appetizer. My stomach was all like \"Oh snaps son! Tasty!\"\n\nI don't know why people are hating on Aslam's. Dosa always has a line and I feel like the food is over hyped. It's like my neighbor telling me Taco Bell is the shit. I could care less about \"being seen\" at a place which is what I feel Dosa is all about. Hell, I better be having a good meal when I am eating out since my personal chef only gets two days off a week. Really, I make him cook hard.\n\nIn the end, I felt Aslam's was well worth the price. It might be a bit more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the city but it definitely gained me as a customer. We also scored a free dessert as well since we were so awesome. Dosa where u at?\n\nBATHROOM REVIEW\n----------------------------------------\nAslam's had a nice, large bathroom that is unisex. There is plenty of space in the thing if you wanted to join the \"I had sex in the restaurant bathroom\" club. From what I hear, it is more prestigious than the Mile High Club.

The great thing about Indian food is that plenty of the dishes offer these options and she had quite a selection to choose from. My 10 year sister went with Chicken Pakora as well as nibbling off our plates and the starters we ordered. She stated that this was her new favorite restaurant.  For starters we had the Kachumber (cucumber, tomato, onion mixture with lime and herbs) which was so fresh and flavorful; Calamari (very nice breading that wasn't too heavy); Achar Pachranga (a spicy pickle mixture that was a little different and not as popular at the table as the others); and the Chicken Tikka - Tandoori style which was absolutely amazing - the chicken was moist and had the perfect tandoori seasoning flavor of herbs, garlic, spices, and served on a hot skillet with onions and peppers. \n\nFor our entrees my boyfriend had the Rogan Josh with lamb which he rated as being good, cooked well, but the flavors were a bit muddled and didn't pop as much as he hoped they would. My Chicken Jalfrezi on the other hand popped and wow'd myself and my boyfriend. This dish was amazing. I am a huge fan of curries that have the perfect kick of heat - usually my go to is either Madras or Vindaloo but this time I opted for Jalfrezi and am so glad that I did.

The staff is really warm/friendly, and authentic, this ain't no Mission Chinese with Caucasian hipster waiters. The location is awesome, if you're bougey like me you can park in the garage on 21st without leaving the sidewalk (or take the BART and walk over to Valencia if Uber pool is too rich for your blood)\n\nFood Commentary:\nAs an Asian yuppie who has eaten my fair share of Indian, I learned there are 5 things you can always safely order at an Indian joint... 1) chicken tikka masala 2) tandoori chicken 3) samosas 4) garlic naan 5) saag paneer (not sure if its served here)... I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

If ever I'm facing an ingredient-free fridge and takeout is the answer, I think of Aslam's Rasoi.  The food is delicious.  The flavors are deep and complex and the execution of the basics is spot-on.\n\nThe pulao is superb, the grains are separate and distinct, tender but toothsome.  As a rice enthusiast, this is important to me!  The naan is similarly perfect.  A little charred, a little crispy, and very chewy and bubbly.\n\nI always get the chicken tikka masala and it is fantastic.  The meat is tender and juicy with a hint of smokiness which is delightful.  The sauce is flavorful and rich.  Last time I requested \"spicy\" on my order and they did deliver! It was HOT! \n\nThe samosas can be a little bit hit or miss, but last time they were great.  What I appreciate most is that the pastry itself is well seasoned and delicious.\n\nMy main complaint is probably more an issue with Grubhub, but occasionally I'll log in to place my order, only to see that I'm \"outside the delivery radius\" and I can only order for pickup.  Mind you, I've successfully had their food delivered to my apartment many many times.  But now and then, there's some sort of malfunction.  When I've tried to call the restaurant to ask if I can order delivery directly, no one has answered the phone.  Last time this happened, I ordered through Eat24 and everything was fine.

The ground lamb is not the low quality stuff you may find at some of the places in the tenderloin. High quality, fresh goround lamb, perfectly seasoned. We also tried the assorted appetizers, chicken vindaloo, a mixed vegetable dish that was made with cream, fresh frruit, and nuts, assorted naan basket, and basmati rices.

I asked for it hot and it came out spicy enough but the kind of spicy that is too much like white noise -- heat without the flavor of the chilis.  Save for that complaint this is probably the best bhindi masala I've had at a restaurant in recent memory.\n\nI was not totally jazzed by the fact that Aslam's, like a lot of other indian restaurants these days, it seems, requires that you pay for papad.  I ended up opting for the assorted appetizers - samosa, pakora, papad, and the items themselves were solid.  I have to call Aslam's out on the chutneys though -- they might as well have been aiolis, with none of the bite you except from a solid chutney.\n\nI also got the raita which I found to be better than the average restaurant raita.

In other words, there's a lot of selection if you're in a South Asian culinary mood. Perhaps the plethora of choices is the reason Jamie W. and I have bypassed this somewhat more higher-end spot on Valencia, even though we heard it was among the best of the bunch. We've also been scrupulously watching our intake of food for the past several months and benefiting from our healthy outlook in many ways including our evolving taste in Indian food.\n\nThat meant we bypassed the naans, the samosas, and even the papadum in favor of the $5 Kachumber, a delightfully light, sharable salad of fresh cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes with fresh herbs and lime juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2upWc24). It managed to lend fresh crunch and cleanse our palates for the treats to come. The centerpiece of our order was the $22 Full Tandoori Chicken, which we hadn't had for many a month. It was indeed a full chicken cut up and marinated in yogurt and spices and served on a metal platter rather than the standard black cast-iron plate (photo: http://bit.ly/2t1U25c). Perhaps because we hadn't had it in a while, the poultry tasted particularly satisfying that night, comparable to our gold standard at Alhamra.\n\nWhile Jamie focused on the breasts, I went headlong into the drumsticks and thighs and enjoyed the tender meat and charred skin. To offset the protein, we ordered one of our favorites, the $11 Bhindi Masala, a plate of okra saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers, onions, fresh tomatoes, and spices that wasn't too saucy and provided a fresher taste than most we've tried in the city (photo: http://bit.ly/2vodN7R). We were particularly won over by the $11 Dal Saag, a saucy plate of fresh spinach with lentils, herbs, and spices that had just the right mix of flavors to complement the chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/2te2Ys2).

It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

The staff is really warm/friendly, and authentic, this ain't no Mission Chinese with Caucasian hipster waiters. The location is awesome, if you're bougey like me you can park in the garage on 21st without leaving the sidewalk (or take the BART and walk over to Valencia if Uber pool is too rich for your blood)\n\nFood Commentary:\nAs an Asian yuppie who has eaten my fair share of Indian, I learned there are 5 things you can always safely order at an Indian joint... 1) chicken tikka masala 2) tandoori chicken 3) samosas 4) garlic naan 5) saag paneer (not sure if its served here)... I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

I can't recall everything that was ordered but my mother ordered a dish that was gluten and dairy free. The great thing about Indian food is that plenty of the dishes offer these options and she had quite a selection to choose from. My 10 year sister went with Chicken Pakora as well as nibbling off our plates and the starters we ordered. She stated that this was her new favorite restaurant.  For starters we had the Kachumber (cucumber, tomato, onion mixture with lime and herbs) which was so fresh and flavorful; Calamari (very nice breading that wasn't too heavy); Achar Pachranga (a spicy pickle mixture that was a little different and not as popular at the table as the others); and the Chicken Tikka - Tandoori style which was absolutely amazing - the chicken was moist and had the perfect tandoori seasoning flavor of herbs, garlic, spices, and served on a hot skillet with onions and peppers. \n\nFor our entrees my boyfriend had the Rogan Josh with lamb which he rated as being good, cooked well, but the flavors were a bit muddled and didn't pop as much as he hoped they would.

I am a huge fan of curries that have the perfect kick of heat - usually my go to is either Madras or Vindaloo but this time I opted for Jalfrezi and am so glad that I did.

Both friends I dined with here were shocked that I had never had Indian food.  I guess I was kind of shocked too.  But for my first experience with this tasty and robust food, I was glad that I had it at Aslam's. \n\nA little fearful of the spice-level and subsequent digestive calamities it may produce, I settled for the Chicken Tikka Masala -- chicken sauteed with herbs, spices, tomatoes and cream. My friends had the Chicken Madras -- chicken curry cooked in a spicy coconut sauce with golden raisins -- and Seekh Kebab -- ground lamb mixed with a bunch of herbs and spices. Thankfully, the waiter asked us that important questions... \"how spicy do you want it?\" We all responded... \"mild!\"  Yes, we all are a little spice-phobes, but too much spice can ruin a meal for me. My entree was fantastic. Very rich, and filling -- I was only able to eat about half of it. My friends also enjoyed their entrees -- although one friend thought the food wasn't as good as it had been on previous visits. \n\nWe also order some Pulao -- a Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon and cinnamon. It was very flavorful, yet light. We also order some regular Naan bread and a goat cheese Naan that were great compliments to all of our dinners. And, a great way to sop-up the delicious sauces.\n\nI really like the atmosphere of Aslam's too -- it wasn't too Bollywood-ish. It was really colorful and cozy. We had a table in the corner by the window, a bit set-off from the rest of the diners. And the bench/couch I sat on was very comfy with plush pillows that I could sink my tired back into. \n\nOverall, I'd have to say my first adventure with Indian food was fantastic. From now on, I'll make sure to keep this savory cuisine on my list of go-to foods.

The Master Chef and Owner, Mohammed Aslam was from Indian Oven in the Haight formerly and has won many awards from Zagat, SF Weekly, San Francisco Magazine and the like. He opened Aslam's Rasoi in April 2006 where he took over the former restaurant there which was called just Rasoi and thus made it Aslam's Rasoi.  His Son, Asif and Daughter, Sehrish, both work there and are very sweet and extremely accommodating.

Well, let me tell you...\n\nFor me, the Curries are perfectly prepared where the Spices are just right. The Meats, from Lamb to Chicken or Prawns are always incredibly tender.

I do have my favorites though, so let me share these with you.\n\nmust-try's if you're into that sort of Dish:\n-if you like Lamb Saag, you HAVE to try theirs.

Anything, at all on their Menu, you HAVE to try the Rasoi's Lamb Chops!   Tender Lamb Chops marinated in homemade Yogurt and Aslam's Spices. You won't find this under the Lamb section, but in the Tandoori section. They are Unbelievably Good! So Tender, Juicy and Succulent...

Aslam, the chef/owner of this family owned and run restaurant, has been a chef at many well known restaurants including Indian Oven and Rottee.\n\nWe wnet early last night which gave us a chance to chat with the whole family. I've never met such genuine people in my life.\n\nNow the food...yummmmmmy!!! My wife and I love indian/pakistani food and have tried just about any restaurant in the bay area. This is one of the best! First off, the ingredients are high quality and fresh. We tried the Sikh Kabob which was THE BEST we've had anywhere. The ground lamb is not the low quality stuff you may find at some of the places in the tenderloin. High quality, fresh goround lamb, perfectly seasoned. We also tried the assorted appetizers, chicken vindaloo, a mixed vegetable dish that was made with cream, fresh frruit, and nuts, assorted naan basket, and basmati rices. EVERYTHING was very well done! For desert we had golab jamon and rice pudding, on the house, and both were freshly made and delicious.\n\nSee, I used to live in london and kind of spoiled when it comes to indian/pakistani food. This restaurant is the first restaurant in the bay area that comes very close to the indian food in england.\n\nI can say with confidence that we've found are favorite pakistani/indian restaurant and we will go back many many times.\n\nGood job Aslam...delicious food!", "rating": 4, "date": "2006-10-21"}, {"excerpts": ["My boyfriend said his Chicken Vindaloo was spiced just right.

I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

The Master Chef and Owner, Mohammed Aslam was from Indian Oven in the Haight formerly and has won many awards from Zagat, SF Weekly, San Francisco Magazine and the like. He opened Aslam's Rasoi in April 2006 where he took over the former restaurant there which was called just Rasoi and thus made it Aslam's Rasoi.

I do have my favorites though, so let me share these with you.\n\nmust-try's if you're into that sort of Dish:\n-if you like Lamb Saag, you HAVE to try theirs.

Anything, at all on their Menu, you HAVE to try the Rasoi's Lamb Chops!   Tender Lamb Chops marinated in homemade Yogurt and Aslam's Spices. You won't find this under the Lamb section, but in the Tandoori section. They are Unbelievably Good! So Tender, Juicy and Succulent...

Thankfully, the waiter asked us that important questions... \"how spicy do you want it?\" We all responded... \"mild!\"  Yes, we all are a little spice-phobes, but too much spice can ruin a meal for me. My entree was fantastic. Very rich, and filling -- I was only able to eat about half of it. My friends also enjoyed their entrees -- although one friend thought the food wasn't as good as it had been on previous visits. \n\nWe also order some Pulao -- a Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon and cinnamon. It was very flavorful, yet light. We also order some regular Naan bread and a goat cheese Naan that were great compliments to all of our dinners.

We walked in on a Monday night, after deciding that Dosa was too much of a scene, looking for a low-key meal, not too expensive, with very little hassle.

Both friends I dined with here were shocked that I had never had Indian food.  I guess I was kind of shocked too.  But for my first experience with this tasty and robust food, I was glad that I had it at Aslam's. \n\nA little fearful of the spice-level and subsequent digestive calamities it may produce, I settled for the Chicken Tikka Masala -- chicken sauteed with herbs, spices, tomatoes and cream. My friends had the Chicken Madras -- chicken curry cooked in a spicy coconut sauce with golden raisins -- and Seekh Kebab -- ground lamb mixed with a bunch of herbs and spices. Thankfully, the waiter asked us that important questions... \"how spicy do you want it?\" We all responded... \"mild!\"  Yes, we all are a little spice-phobes, but too much spice can ruin a meal for me. My entree was fantastic. Very rich, and filling -- I was only able to eat about half of it. My friends also enjoyed their entrees -- although one friend thought the food wasn't as good as it had been on previous visits. \n\nWe also order some Pulao -- a Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon and cinnamon. It was very flavorful, yet light. We also order some regular Naan bread and a goat cheese Naan that were great compliments to all of our dinners. And, a great way to sop-up the delicious sauces.\n\nI really like the atmosphere of Aslam's too -- it wasn't too Bollywood-ish. It was really colorful and cozy. We had a table in the corner by the window, a bit set-off from the rest of the diners. And the bench/couch I sat on was very comfy with plush pillows that I could sink my tired back into. \n\nOverall, I'd have to say my first adventure with Indian food was fantastic.

To offset the protein, we ordered one of our favorites, the $11 Bhindi Masala, a plate of okra saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers, onions, fresh tomatoes, and spices that wasn't too saucy and provided a fresher taste than most we've tried in the city (photo: http://bit.ly/2vodN7R).

It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more.

In other words, there's a lot of selection if you're in a South Asian culinary mood. Perhaps the plethora of choices is the reason Jamie W. and I have bypassed this somewhat more higher-end spot on Valencia, even though we heard it was among the best of the bunch. We've also been scrupulously watching our intake of food for the past several months and benefiting from our healthy outlook in many ways including our evolving taste in Indian food.\n\nThat meant we bypassed the naans, the samosas, and even the papadum in favor of the $5 Kachumber, a delightfully light, sharable salad of fresh cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes with fresh herbs and lime juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2upWc24). It managed to lend fresh crunch and cleanse our palates for the treats to come. The centerpiece of our order was the $22 Full Tandoori Chicken, which we hadn't had for many a month. It was indeed a full chicken cut up and marinated in yogurt and spices and served on a metal platter rather than the standard black cast-iron plate (photo: http://bit.ly/2t1U25c). Perhaps because we hadn't had it in a while, the poultry tasted particularly satisfying that night, comparable to our gold standard at Alhamra.\n\nWhile Jamie focused on the breasts, I went headlong into the drumsticks and thighs and enjoyed the tender meat and charred skin. To offset the protein, we ordered one of our favorites, the $11 Bhindi Masala, a plate of okra saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers, onions, fresh tomatoes, and spices that wasn't too saucy and provided a fresher taste than most we've tried in the city (photo: http://bit.ly/2vodN7R). We were particularly won over by the $11 Dal Saag, a saucy plate of fresh spinach with lentils, herbs, and spices that had just the right mix of flavors to complement the chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/2te2Ys2).

While there can be a lot of variation in the way the dishes are prepared from day to day (with different cooks), even on their \"off\" days they are still better than the other restaurants in this city.  It is a bit more expensive than other restaurants in this area but is well worth the extra cost.  \n\nThe Pakistani/North Indian style dishes are well seasoned and taste fresh.  This is one of the few places that actually makes my food spicy enough for my tastes (though they're happy to make dishes less spicy).  I have tried most of the things on the menu, and the only thing that was not good was the Achar Pachranga.   So many dishes here are \"favorites,\" that it's impossible for me to order less than 5 items.  I either have to dine with friends or just make a pig of myself.\n\nAmong my favorite dishes are:\n- Kachumber (this is light and refreshing, a great way to start the meal);\n- Raita (their raita is the best I've had in SF, and no matter how much I try, I can't approximate theirs at home); \n- Paneer Makhani (this tastes different than anything else on the menu - rich, buttery, tomato-y, so very good);\n- Seekh Kebab (the meat is very fresh tasting, it's spiced perfectly and delicious with fresh lemon - this is the best seekh kebab I've had anywhere);\n- Lamb Biryani (the lamb here is just wonderful in general);\n- Goat Cheese Naan (normally i am not a fan of cheese mixed with naan but the peppers and green onions make this so tasty).\n\nSee what I mean? This is my minimum order... the tandoori chicken, saag paneer, paneer tikka korma, saag aloo, and karachi gosht are all excellent as well.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is colorful, and it's pretty clean for the Mission.

I never feel hurried here, even when patrons are waiting for tables, they do nothing to rush you through dinner.

Service was wonderful and the food very tasty. Why the 3.5 stars??\n\nIt is very pricey for the amount of food you get; The prawn dish had maybe 6 prawns and was 18 dollars. Lamb dish was 11-12 dollars maybe 10 small pieces of lamb.\nThe naan....is 3 bucks but you get three small pieces.

The staff is really warm/friendly, and authentic, this ain't no Mission Chinese with Caucasian hipster waiters. The location is awesome, if you're bougey like me you can park in the garage on 21st without leaving the sidewalk (or take the BART and walk over to Valencia if Uber pool is too rich for your blood)\n\nFood Commentary:\nAs an Asian yuppie who has eaten my fair share of Indian, I learned there are 5 things you can always safely order at an Indian joint... 1) chicken tikka masala 2) tandoori chicken 3) samosas 4) garlic naan 5) saag paneer (not sure if its served here)... I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place. Born/Raised in NYC, I always got stuck eating Indian...

Well, silly, it's the nine days a year to try places you've always wanted to try in the Mission but haven't tried yet because you're tired of dealing with hipsters and techies.  During TotMW, aka Burning Man, you can do as I did and have Aslam's Rasoi all to yourself because all the hipsters are getting high and dirty in Nevada, and some of the techies are there as well because they think they're hipsters and have way too much money not to spend it on made-to-order art and really expensive drugs.\n\nThe food was good.  The sauce in one of the dishes reminded me of the sauce that comes with the malai kofta at Chaat Cafe in Berkeley.  I wasn't expecting that flavor pairing with what I was eating, but it wasn't bad, just surprising.  All the ingredients seemed fresh, and the naan was delicious.  This place definitely gets high marks for its naan.\n\nThe service was good, but I did feel strange being the only person here.

Casual enough to have a random dinner night with friends, or formal enough to bring a date. The lighting and decor is lovely! There's plenty of seating, without making a person feel claustrophobic. There is also a cool bar. However, they do not carry any hard liquor at the bar, there are a few beers on tap, and wines. (I personally had a tangerine wheat beer.)\nMoving onto the food now....\nWe ordered naan, rice, bhindi masala(okra), and chicken tikka masala. Both entrees were DELICIOUS!!!! The bhindi masala was freshly made, and perfectly accommodating to our love for spicy food. The chicken tikka masala was very savory and creamy, the chicken in it was tender. Overall food was BOMB.com!\n Moving onto the experience and the customer service...\nEXCELLENT!!! We actually said hello to Asalm, the man himself!

My friends had the Chicken Madras -- chicken curry cooked in a spicy coconut sauce with golden raisins -- and Seekh Kebab -- ground lamb mixed with a bunch of herbs and spices. Thankfully, the waiter asked us that important questions... \"how spicy do you want it?\" We all responded... \"mild!\"  Yes, we all are a little spice-phobes, but too much spice can ruin a meal for me. My entree was fantastic. Very rich, and filling -- I was only able to eat about half of it. My friends also enjoyed their entrees -- although one friend thought the food wasn't as good as it had been on previous visits. \n\nWe also order some Pulao -- a Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon and cinnamon. It was very flavorful, yet light. We also order some regular Naan bread and a goat cheese Naan that were great compliments to all of our dinners.

Doesn't roll off of the tongue for me.  It mean's Aslam's Kitchen in Hindi.  My Hindi is a little bit rusty/nonexistent.\n\nThe food, however - that I do remember.\n\nIt was surprisingly good!  We walked in on a Monday night, after deciding that Dosa was too much of a scene, looking for a low-key meal, not too expensive, with very little hassle.  There were only a few people in there, so our expectations weren't that high, but it was Monday night and late (around 9:45).  We were really happy when the food turned out to be better than we had hoped - and in fact, it was REALLY good!\n\nWe started with the Bombay Pakoras, which are calamari fried in chickpea batter - light, not greasy, very tasty.  They offer more pakoras than I have ever seen, so if you love pakoras, this is the place for you.  Little fried things, get in my belly!\n\nThen we had the Chicken Madras, which is similar to Korma, cooked in  coconut sauce with raisins, and it was also delicious.  The Aslam's Lamb Chops, cooked in the Tandoori oven, were succulent - I asked for them rare, and our sweet waiter kept offering to cook them more for me, but they were perfect.  \n\nThe naan was tender/crisp and had a nice portion of clarified butter on top (yum), and my lemonade had an interesting spice to it that I loved.\n\nThe prices are higher than in some Indian restaurants (around $11-13 for a currry, $14-18 for tandoori), but the food is more sophisticated, so I thought that they were warranted.  The executive chef used to be at Roti and Indian Oven, and it definitely feels like a mash-up of those 2 restaurant's styles - less trendy than Roti, but more inventive than Indian Oven.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try some other dishes, including the Saag Paneer, which is one of my favorites.

I appreciated that our server was honest and said since we were having tandoori already, we should go for this one (even though it was the cheaper option!). He was right about having this variety. The sauce was thick, had great texture. The lamb was very hearty - a little hard almost. It would have been very dry if it weren't served int eh sauce.

On the menu, this sounds really impressive with all the spices, but I couldn't taste most of it.

The lightest, slightest layer of crisp. Perfectly soft on the inside. However, it wasn't exactly \"stuffed\" with goat cheese, and we didn't taste any bell peppers. The first piece we had was phenomenal - it had a huge chunk of goat cheese on top, was slightly sweet, and was like an indian flavored pizza.

The spicy yogurt cream sauce was perfectly balanced, and the bits of fruit added a strange and exotic element to the dish. \n\nThe tomato curry sauce was rich and satisfying. The two dishes were delicious together and seperately. \n\nWe ate as much as we could and my boyfriend chided me when I asked the waiter to box up the measly amounts of food we had left. A few hours later, I took to the Navrattan Korma and ended up scraping every inch of sauce I could from the sides of the take-out box. \n\nI'm definitely excited to try more from the menu. They have a pretty extensive selection of vegetarian, seafood, lamb, chicken and rice dishes.

Both friends I dined with here were shocked that I had never had Indian food.  I guess I was kind of shocked too.  But for my first experience with this tasty and robust food, I was glad that I had it at Aslam's. \n\nA little fearful of the spice-level and subsequent digestive calamities it may produce, I settled for the Chicken Tikka Masala -- chicken sauteed with herbs, spices, tomatoes and cream. My friends had the Chicken Madras -- chicken curry cooked in a spicy coconut sauce with golden raisins -- and Seekh Kebab -- ground lamb mixed with a bunch of herbs and spices. Thankfully, the waiter asked us that important questions... \"how spicy do you want it?\" We all responded... \"mild!\"  Yes, we all are a little spice-phobes, but too much spice can ruin a meal for me. My entree was fantastic. Very rich, and filling -- I was only able to eat about half of it. My friends also enjoyed their entrees -- although one friend thought the food wasn't as good as it had been on previous visits. \n\nWe also order some Pulao -- a Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon and cinnamon. It was very flavorful, yet light. We also order some regular Naan bread and a goat cheese Naan that were great compliments to all of our dinners. And, a great way to sop-up the delicious sauces.\n\nI really like the atmosphere of Aslam's too -- it wasn't too Bollywood-ish. It was really colorful and cozy. We had a table in the corner by the window, a bit set-off from the rest of the diners. And the bench/couch I sat on was very comfy with plush pillows that I could sink my tired back into. \n\nOverall, I'd have to say my first adventure with Indian food was fantastic.

Anything, at all on their Menu, you HAVE to try the Rasoi's Lamb Chops!   Tender Lamb Chops marinated in homemade Yogurt and Aslam's Spices.

They happily do take out and in my experience, take out orders are prepared very quickly compared to the wait time when dining in.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-12-13"}, {"excerpts": ["For starters we had the Kachumber (cucumber, tomato, onion mixture with lime and herbs) which was so fresh and flavorful; Calamari (very nice breading that wasn't too heavy); Achar Pachranga (a spicy pickle mixture that was a little different and not as popular at the table as the others); and the Chicken Tikka - Tandoori style which was absolutely amazing - "], "author": "Lilia C.", "review": "This is some of the best Indian food I have had since I was last in the UK and is definitely a must any time I come back to SF. We arrived around 9pm on a Friday night and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 5. Our server, Asif (who I just learned is the owner's son) was extremely accommodating and communicative asking us where we would prefer to be seated (by the window) and made it happen. We grabbed a drink at the bar (a few beers on tap, I went with Racer 5) and had some papadum and nan brought out while we waited.  Our service that evening was excellent - so friendly, cheerful, and attentive. The prices are very reasonable and everyone was very pleased with the food.\n\nNow onto the food - WOW. I can't recall everything that was ordered but my mother ordered a dish that was gluten and dairy free. The great thing about Indian food is that plenty of the dishes offer these options and she had quite a selection to choose from. My 10 year sister went with Chicken Pakora as well as nibbling off our plates and the starters we ordered. She stated that this was her new favorite restaurant.  For starters we had the Kachumber (cucumber, tomato, onion mixture with lime and herbs) which was so fresh and flavorful; Calamari (very nice breading that wasn't too heavy); Achar Pachranga (a spicy pickle mixture that was a little different and not as popular at the table as the others); and the Chicken Tikka - Tandoori style which was absolutely amazing - the chicken was moist and had the perfect tandoori seasoning flavor of herbs, garlic, spices, and served on a hot skillet with onions and peppers. \n\nFor our entrees my boyfriend had the Rogan Josh with lamb which he rated as being good, cooked well, but the flavors were a bit muddled and didn't pop as much as he hoped they would. My Chicken Jalfrezi on the other hand popped and wow'd myself and my boyfriend. This dish was amazing. I am a huge fan of curries that have the perfect kick of heat - usually my go to is either Madras or Vindaloo but this time I opted for Jalfrezi and am so glad that I did. Again, the chicken was moist but the sauce and vegetables completed this dish. Our garlic basil nan was delicious as well.

My man and his parents have eaten here several times and they are huge food critics.  I was kinda stuck on Masala near 9th Avenue and Lincoln before my most wonderful experience at Aslam's.  \n\nI wanted to give them 4 1/2 stars, but only because we were super hungry and we had to wait a while before having our orders taken.  They were short staffed, so it wasn't really their fault, so I don't feel bad giving them a 5 star review...The server was also really cool and kept apologizing for the wait, so it's all good!  They brought us delicious papadum and that ohhhhh so awesome yogurt and sweet sauce to snack on while we waited for our food.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a lamb dish (lamb happens to be their specialty) and I ordered the saag paneer (creamed spinach with homemade cheese).

My only one grievance was portion size, although that may be a good thing!\n\nI never would have eaten at this restaurant because it is sort of out of my way but our friend lives in the Mission and so now we are in love with this restaurant.  Since we spend so much time in the city, now we know where to go for a sure-fire meal and yummy take-away.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is lovely and I absolutely loved the tables, each one seemed to be hand painted with a different design.  The lights were low, the wine list was adequate and the wait staff was just only a tiny bit slow, but it was quite busy at 9:30 at night, so that isn't too bad.

With your appetite all ready, ease into a couple main dishes (the curries are great, so is the sagg panneer, haven't tried the tandoori yet), add some rice, naan and a couple Kingfischer's & you are all set my friend.\n\nI met the owner when the restaurant first opened (under new ownership), he's a great guy & gave me a tour of the kitchen, which looked great. They use the authentic tandoori ovens (with charcoal vs. electric heat). His daughter, son & other relatives all work at the restaurant, and are really nice.
