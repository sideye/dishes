Happy hour runs from 3-6 PM at after 10 PM 7 days a week (including weekends), so it's actually pretty accessible. The appetizers are $4 during happy hour, so I ordered some chicken karaage along with my chashu ramen, which was $10.95. Just FYI, lunch is served until 5 PM according to their menu.\n\nMy food all came out within 5 minutes of ordering, so it was super fast. I got a complimentary wakame salad for checking-in (they didn't have edamame or the cold tofu), which apparently is a seafood salad. It was really clean tasting, without a strong seaweed flavor, and just lightly dressed. It was definitely a good start to my meal.\n\nThen came my chashu ramen, which was overall pretty good. Mainly, there's probably around 6 slices of sliced pork, a good handful of bamboo shoots, and noodles all in a slightly cloudy tonkotsu broth. The pork didn't really have a strong BBQ flavor, but it actually tasted pretty clean, like pork shoulder just roasted in the oven. It was actually pretty good, but didn't have that distinctive chashu taste that I was expecting. I wasn't a huge fan of the bamboo shoots, they were just kind of there and stayed out of the way. The noodles are nice and bouncy and didn't get too soaked in the broth, so no complaints there. And the broth had good substance to it and had a rich pork flavor throughout, so you could tell that they had boiled the bones well for this broth. It's not a complex flavor, but it hits the notes that it needs to.\n\nThe chicken karaage came out piping hot, but was probably the most disappointing of the 3. It was a lot of chicken, probably about 12 pieces, but the outside was a bit too heavily coated, and the inside was a bit overcooked. It wasn't dry yet, but it was headed that way. But I can't really complain because for $4, it's still a good amount of food and a good value. Plus, it was still tasty, just not the best I've had. For that same amount of chicken karaage elsewhere, you could definitely be paying up to $9-10 bucks.\n\nThe pictures can be deceiving, as I actually got a lot of food. I walked away from this restaurant full, which is really a rarity. It's a pretty unassuming place, and people aren't tripping over their feet to get here, but it is solid quality food with some very reasonable prices. The food probably won't wow you, but it gets all the basic things right for a good meal.

Both were lacking in filling and were skimping on key ingredients.\n\n:::Crispy Daimaru::: reminiscent of cream cheese wontons. They made the mistake of using 2 skins just to wrap one filling's worth, perhaps to look bigger and it won't look as sad to have 3 big circles on the dish, rather than having 3 pieces that only took half the space. When you bite through the crust and finally get to the filling, it's sorta worth it. A little like imitation crab with spinach. To be fair, this was a free dish so I won't complain too much, but I would be pretty pissed if I paid for this.\n:::Takoyaki::: looks really delicious, nicely fried, and had a good taste. It was a whole different story once you bite into it. The batter tasted underfried, and there is only 1 little piece of octopus :\\ quite sad. I ended up taking bites of it just to look for the octopus piece and left a bunch of half-eaten takoyaki halves on my plate. \n\nThis is one of those places you come for the ambiance, music, colors on the wall, LCD screens, and the fact that it probably won't get too crowded.

Genki Ramen is like Randy Moss.  When you first look at him, he looks like the best receiver in the league.  Upon a closer examination, you realize that there is something slightly wrong with him.  If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.  When you eat it, some are very good, but others have some fatal frauds.  They make mistakes that normal Japanese chef would never make, which suggests that the chef is not Japanese.  If you know how to avoid these landmines, Genki could be very useful.  Of course, if you are not an expert in Japanese cuisine, you will probably not notice these mistakes, so you might enjoy their food without any issues, which is a good thing.   \n\nHOW TO USE GENKI:\n* Go there for lunch, order Chashu ramen ($8) with $1 fried rice and $1 gyoza.\n* Go there with friends, order a bunch of grilled robata-yaki items and enjoy them with Kirin or Sapporo draft.\n\nHITS:\nOkonomiyaki - While not perfect, it was pretty good.\nCharcoal grilled items, including Chicken Gizzard\nHomemade gyoza\nPumpkin and Yam tempura\nUjikintoki - nice dessert\n\nLANDMINES:\nGrilled onigiri - what the ?!?

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I selected the deep fried Chicken Karaage and the Chashu Ramen with the addition of corn.

I finally discovered recently that they're not quite as busy during the weekday lunch hour so that's when I made my visit.\n\nI was greeted by the lone waitress who gestured to me to take a seat anywhere.  The interior is quite nice with soft avocado green tones, dim lighting, comfortable custom-made chairs with high back support and flat panel televisions throughout airing CNN and the Food Network (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=skSB5mgp0CCRpY6zD-I-8g).  The empty bar looked quite nice with all of its soft colors (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=wm3JCj88qgn6Wzaskkf0oA).  There's a large window in the back of the restaurant that looks into the open kitchen.\n\nAs the waitress served other tables I got a chance to study the lengthy menu which has good descriptions of all of the selections.  I asked about the seafood sampler appetizer dish, but the waitress quite honestly told me it might be too much food (along with an order of ramen) for one person.  I selected the deep fried Chicken Karaage and the Chashu Ramen with the addition of corn.  There are about a dozen items you can add to your ramen, for additional costs of course.\n\nThe wait was quite lengthy for the food to arrive.  I understood this though because there appeared to be only one chef working in the open kitchen preparing food for many tables.  I sat back and watched some decadent desserts being created on the Food Network.\n\nThe Chicken Karaage (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=098hWFpepQEafzvxnSTAYw) arrived first, but my order of ramen was fast on its heel.  I allowed the ramen to sit a bit while I sampled the chicken appetizer.  Maybe I expected more than just deep fried chunks of lightly battered chicken thigh meat.  Just slightly tastier than an order of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, the moist chicken chunks arrived with a drizzling of sauce.  I couldn't make out what that sauce was because the chicken was so salty that it overpowered the sauce.  I've never been more thankful for that cup of complimentary hot tea.\n\nThe Chashu Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=pmSWIkmZMvpLcwD7pE9TMw) was much better.

The single negative was the hard boiled egg half whereas the egg white was steaming hot but the yolk part was room temperature cold.  There was a fair amount of ramen noodles underneath those ingredients too.\n\nI'm not familiar with the different types of ramen noodles, but these appeared to be similar to angel hair pasta in appearance and texture but much softer to the bite.

The dashi stock is tasty and I love watching the bonito flakes dance on top b/c of the heat from the tofu.\n\nTakoyaki: Mmmmm...definitely reminded me of the versions I got at various street cars in Japan.\n\nChashu Ramen: The restaurant name-sakes lives up to it's name.

Sheesh, talk about stacking the deck against myself! I hate going to restaurants when it's slow and near closing time, because kitchen staff typically are more focused on cleaning up the kitchen rather than their cooking.

I chuckled to myself when I saw my server run into the kitchen to make the notation on my ticket. I suppose their order entry system doesn't account for noodle doneness. This was interesting, as the menu mentions in a footnote that you can specify the oil/fat content and the firmness of the noodle, which was a nice gesture suggesting that the restauranteur did some research into ramen.\n\nAt any rate, I had their #401, their chashu ramen, and it was decent.

Not too eggy or day-glo yellow like noodles you see sometimes in other establishments.\n\nThe portion size seemed a bit small, but not too small. I'll have to ask if I can order extra noodles next time. Don't recall seeing the option on the menu tho'.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Especially if you are drunk and craving something hot, salty and oily. Definitely a better option in my book than a slice of 'za from Nizario's up the street.\n\nI would go on a limb to say that Genki's ramen is probably better than the offerings at Halu, Katana-Ya, Oyaji, or Tampopo.

It came with cubes of soft tofu and minced, seasoned pork.\n\nThe service was semi-prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere was a bit noisy with groups chatting over the J-pop music.

"], "author": "Steph L.", "review": "I came here for dinner with a friend last night. Like a good little Yelper, I looked at their Yelp review page before I left work. From there, I clicked on their website. The first thing that caught my eye on their website wasn't the picture of a delicious-looking bowl of tonkatsu ramen, but a hyperlink labeled \"Coupon\". I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings. Woot woot!\n\nFree food makes me happy, and free-food-related happiness makes me more inclined to give a good rating--which may be why Genki Ramen gets 3-stars instead of 2. (Because really, in Yelp words, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".)\n\nMy friend and I chose the CRISPY DAIMARU out of sheer curiousity as to what they were. What we got were 3 crispy deep-fried disc-shaped raviolis filled with cream cheese, spinach, and fish cake. They were served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything. It didn't make my lips smack and I've definitely had better.\n\nAlas, my search for the best ramen in SF goes on...", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-09-28"}, {"excerpts": ["*Chashu Ramen\n", "*"], "author": "Chuck N.", "review": "Always craving a bowl of hot, yummy noodles late in the eve.

Anyway, my little ordered the chashu ramen and my twin and I both got the curry tonkatsu.\n\nNow, after living in Japan for four months and tasting the most amazing ramen (and other japanese dishes for that matter) ever, I prepared myself for mediocre food.  Which, is not to say that far off.  The ramen was a little undercooked in my opinion (I'm used to super soft noodles), rather chewy... but otherwise tasted pretty good.  The curry tonkatsu was on point but not enough curry for all the rice.  Mmm.  And I love, love, love milk tea... so I ordered one without caramel.  It's the closest thing I've found to my favorite brand back in Nippon.\n\n3 stars for the so-so food, +1 for the wide variety on the menu of nihon tabemono staples (which I will definitely be back to try - i.e. okonomiyaki), -1 for the confusing decor.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-12-10"}, {"excerpts": ["can't resist the Chashu ramen in the tonkotsu broth.

I came to Genki Ramen because my dining mates had been here before and wanted to take me here plus the fact that this was an affordable mom and pop place for some down home Ramen didn't hurt at all.\n\nWe came on a Saturday evening at about 7pm and the place wasn't busy at all, as I was able to get a table in the back of the restaurant. You'll notice the rich wood on all of the walls and tables that combined with all of the multitude of flat-screen televisions turned to sports programming provided a homey almost bar-like atmosphere. Since I was sitting back of the restaurant cell phone service is limited in that corner and when I asked if there was a WiFi password to their WiFi option I was immediately rebuked by a server. I must admit despite having the name of the restaurant being named Genki Ramen, the menu has much more than that including Robata grilled items, sizzling rice plates, and even Japanese pancakes!\n\nBut let's face it I was here for their signature dish, their Ramen noodles, the only problem I had was in deciding which one I was supposed to choose on their menu, as I counted no fewer than 19 noodles and soup and three cold Ramen noodle dishes. Decisions, decisions,sometimes it's worth noting that less is more when it comes to menu items. But after a long deliberation, I went with number 412 on the menu, Beef Stew Ramen made with tender, braised beef brisket, spinach, red ginger, served in a tonkatsu base. My dining mate went with a more ambitious meal option with number 703 the beef Okonomiyaki, which is a sizzling deep dish pancake served with shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and topped with seaweed flakes, pancake sauce, mayo and bonito fish flakes. My noodles were a nicely prepared dish with beef that was nicely sliced and prepared as it were pork belly the only drawback is that I wish there were more noodles in my dish to go with all of that excess beef broth. My dining mates' pancake looked unique enough almost like a Japanese pizza, but here too I thought the quantity of food here was lacking. Thankfully Genki Ramen does have a check-in deal via the Yelp app and between a choice between the Edamame or Cold Tofu, we went with the tofu which was an amuse bouche which came topped with dipping sauce and green onions.     \n\nAll in all, we had a decent time at Genki, we were able to sit at our table and enjoy ones company as we dined on our noodles as there wasn't too much business going on to move us out.

We were seated right away as only half the restaurant was full and had our orders placed in a timely manner. I glanced over the menu quickly (they have a huge variety of ramen) and decided on the shrimp tempura and seasonal vegetable miso ramen. We also ordered takoyaki and food came out in no time.\n\nI don't have much experience with takoyaki, but I will say it was pretty good. The fried batter on the outside reminded me of potato and there is a small piece of octopus inside along with the pickled radish and fish flakes and kewpie on top. For 6 pieces, it was about $4. My ramen came out right after and I was happy to see a large plate of assorted tempura with my bowl of ramen and nori. The broth was good because it wasn't too salty, which is the case a lot of the time for me. It is different from some other places because it's also not as rich. Nonetheless, the noodles and broth were pretty decent.\n\nLastly, while we were eating, I checked in on yelp and noticed a free offer and decided why not use it now? You have the option of seaweed salad or these crispy spinach and cream cheese wontons. Of course I went for the wontons...It came with a sweet chili sauce and was ok.\n\nTotal came out to be a little under $25 with tax. 2 ramens, 1 takoyaki and a free appetizer. Not bad!

I started off with the Crispy Daimaru that comes with 3 disc-shaped fried dumplings with a sweet sauce on the side. These are filled with cheese, fish cake, and spinach. When I bit into the center, the cream cheese filling was soft and oozing out. I probably won't order this normally, but it was worth trying. \n\nFor my main order I decided to try their Spicy Mabo Tofu Ramen, which consisted of stir fried spicy soft silken tofu and minced pork in a Tonkatsu base.

They just didn't have enough springiness to them and I found they were slightly overcooked.

(D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything.

We were just talking about how we both want to go to San Mateo to eat ramen and that we can never get in because we go when the restaurants are closed for vacation or we arrive during the off-peak hours when they happen to be closed.  So it was rare to see a ramen place open between 2 and 5pm.\n\nLuckily, 3pm is when Happy Hour starts here and there was hardly a crowd at all inside so we were seated right away.  In addition, the lunch menu is good 7 days a week until 5pm.  They have a good selection of food on their menu.  You can get the lunch special ramen for about $7.95  and add a side dish for just $1 more.  That would be 2 gyozas or 2-3 pieces of chicken karage.  We asked how big the happy hour size was for the same dishes, she said it was a little bigger so we opted for happy hour portions.  The two of us ordered way too much food.  They gave us 6 gyoza, and a whole plate of karage for just $3 a dish.  Not bad for the size.  We also ordered the croquettes- 2 McDonald's hash brown sized croquettes on a plate.\n \nI ordered the chasu ramen that comes with the basic tonkatsu broth and my friend ordered the kimchi ramen.  We both liked our ramen.  There was a good amount of chasu that was soft enough that it fell apart easily but was not overcooked.  It comes with an egg and a ton of green onions and bamboo.  I would have to say it was very flavorful.  Not too salty and not overcooked.  I probably finished all the broth.  I was pretty impressed considering we had no expections for this place.\n\nWe ended up with quite a big of leftovers since the chicken karage appetizer was a good size.  Though sometimes my stomach is not  fully satisfied after eating ramen, I didn't feel jipped by portion sizes here at all.  I was so full that I couldn't even eat anything else for the rest of the night.  I will definitely return.  In fact, I almost returned the next day but decided to wait just a little bit.

Instead, I opted for their okonomiyaki.  But I had doubted it that their okonomiyaki was authentic either.  First all, one option that came with their okonomiyaki was to \"add ramen for $2\", but in Japan, people put \"soba\" onto okonomiyaki, not \"ramen\".  So just from that, I knew it wasn't gonna get real okonomiyaki.  But the beef okonomiyaki with ramen that I ordered turned out to be pretty tasty.  The beef slices were too thick making them tough to chew.  The noodles were incorporated within the batter which is totally unusual since they're usually served on top of or below the okonomiyaki.

You'll notice the rich wood on all of the walls and tables that combined with all of the multitude of flat-screen televisions turned to sports programming provided a homey almost bar-like atmosphere. Since I was sitting back of the restaurant cell phone service is limited in that corner and when I asked if there was a WiFi password to their WiFi option I was immediately rebuked by a server. I must admit despite having the name of the restaurant being named Genki Ramen, the menu has much more than that including Robata grilled items, sizzling rice plates, and even Japanese pancakes!\n\nBut let's face it I was here for their signature dish, their Ramen noodles, the only problem I had was in deciding which one I was supposed to choose on their menu, as I counted no fewer than 19 noodles and soup and three cold Ramen noodle dishes. Decisions, decisions,sometimes it's worth noting that less is more when it comes to menu items. But after a long deliberation, I went with number 412 on the menu, Beef Stew Ramen made with tender, braised beef brisket, spinach, red ginger, served in a tonkatsu base. My dining mate went with a more ambitious meal option with number 703 the beef Okonomiyaki, which is a sizzling deep dish pancake served with shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and topped with seaweed flakes, pancake sauce, mayo and bonito fish flakes. My noodles were a nicely prepared dish with beef that was nicely sliced and prepared as it were pork belly the only drawback is that I wish there were more noodles in my dish to go with all of that excess beef broth. My dining mates' pancake looked unique enough almost like a Japanese pizza, but here too I thought the quantity of food here was lacking. Thankfully Genki Ramen does have a check-in deal via the Yelp app and between a choice between the Edamame or Cold Tofu, we went with the tofu which was an amuse bouche which came topped with dipping sauce and green onions.     \n\nAll in all, we had a decent time at Genki, we were able to sit at our table and enjoy ones company as we dined on our noodles as there wasn't too much business going on to move us out.

If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The tonkatsu broth is rich and flavorful and the noodles are of good quality. \n\n"], "author": "Misha T.", "review": "The food, and the prices especially during happy hour, are really quite good.

We were just talking about how we both want to go to San Mateo to eat ramen and that we can never get in because we go when the restaurants are closed for vacation or we arrive during the off-peak hours when they happen to be closed.  So it was rare to see a ramen place open between 2 and 5pm.\n\nLuckily, 3pm is when Happy Hour starts here and there was hardly a crowd at all inside so we were seated right away.  In addition, the lunch menu is good 7 days a week until 5pm.  They have a good selection of food on their menu.  You can get the lunch special ramen for about $7.95  and add a side dish for just $1 more.  That would be 2 gyozas or 2-3 pieces of chicken karage.  We asked how big the happy hour size was for the same dishes, she said it was a little bigger so we opted for happy hour portions.  The two of us ordered way too much food.  They gave us 6 gyoza, and a whole plate of karage for just $3 a dish.  Not bad for the size.  We also ordered the croquettes- 2 McDonald's hash brown sized croquettes on a plate.\n \nI ordered the chasu ramen that comes with the basic tonkatsu broth and my friend ordered the kimchi ramen.

It's not too salty but definitely has enough flavor, so I kept slurping it up. Noodles were on the tender side of chewy, but I still liked it. Slices of pork (I ordered the Chasu Ramen) were big, and they gave me half a soy sauce egg with the scallions and bamboo shoots.\n\nI should talk about the egg. It's marinated.\nIt's also one of my favorite parts about eating ramen. When the egg isn't there, I'm sad.\nYou can add the egg (and extra meat, noodles, corn, and other toppings) to any ramen. This is excellent. It means I'm free to order whatever type of ramen I want and still get the egg.\nEnd discussion of egg.\n\nWe also had two robatayaki items: chicken gizzard and saba. The saba was huge and not on a skewer. You get a whole half of fish. Value! It's covered in the same sweet sauce you get on unagi, which was surprisingly good with mackerel. Gizzards were kinda tough (they're gizzards, wasn't expecting tenderness). Next time I'm going for the minced chicken and beef tongue.\n\nSince we were there during happy hour (3-7pm), certain appetizers were $3. Gyoza and croquettes were both fried very well and delicious. I will come back for those, too.\n\nThey also have takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and yakisoba. All things I'll eat in the future because I can't find them in most Japanese restaurants. There's lots of sake variety, too.\n\nThe restaurant is kinda dark inside in the evening. There are 4 TVs playing 2 sports channels with no sound because music is blaring.

Sheesh, talk about stacking the deck against myself! I hate going to restaurants when it's slow and near closing time, because kitchen staff typically are more focused on cleaning up the kitchen rather than their cooking. But due to some logistical issues I won't go into, I found myself in the restaurant, hungry and cold.\n\nWell, since they have an exhibition kitchen, I could see all their moves. And they seemed to be focused on their cooking, thank gawd, as the last thing you want is errant splashes of Clorox in your broth.\n\nI prefer my ramen noodles firm, so I specified that for kicks on my order. I chuckled to myself when I saw my server run into the kitchen to make the notation on my ticket. I suppose their order entry system doesn't account for noodle doneness. This was interesting, as the menu mentions in a footnote that you can specify the oil/fat content and the firmness of the noodle, which was a nice gesture suggesting that the restauranteur did some research into ramen.\n\nAt any rate, I had their #401, their chashu ramen, and it was decent. I avoided the other weird fusion ramen abominations (curry tonkatsu ramen WTF???), deciding to go for something much more pedestrian. I also skipped on the various toppings that were on offer like corn and extra chashu.\n\nThe slices of chashu had a nice sweet, ginger soy marinade taste, but it was a bit on the salty side. It probably sat in the stewing liquid for too long. Same goes for the shoyu egg as well.\n\nStandard issue menma tasted fine. Their beni-shoga topping was straight from the jar. Standard foodservice stuff. No complaints there.\n\nThe soup seemed to be a tonkotsu style broth, light milky brown in color from the marrow and collagen that comes from hours of cooking down pork bones. Well, I'm assuming that. For I know, they're just serving up pre-made foodservice broth.\n\nAt any rate, the broth was served nice and hot. Perfect foil for a cold evening. The slices of scallions added a nice kick to the proceedings.\n\nThe noodles came out firm as requested. Nice. They tasted fine. Not too eggy or day-glo yellow like noodles you see sometimes in other establishments.\n\nThe portion size seemed a bit small, but not too small. I'll have to ask if I can order extra noodles next time. Don't recall seeing the option on the menu tho'.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Especially if you are drunk and craving something hot, salty and oily. Definitely a better option in my book than a slice of 'za from Nizario's up the street.\n\nI would go on a limb to say that Genki's ramen is probably better than the offerings at Halu, Katana-Ya, Oyaji, or Tampopo. At $9, it's not a bad deal.\n\nBut then again, that's like picking the lesser of all evils ramen-wise in San Francisco.\n\nI think I'll come back again and check out the other goodies on their menu.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-12-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I suggest the CURRY TONKATSU - it's deep fried pork, in a Curry (not usually fond of) ", "Tonkatsu broth ramen dish.  \n\n", "BUT THE CURRY TONKATSU....

Like a good little Yelper, I looked at their Yelp review page before I left work. From there, I clicked on their website. The first thing that caught my eye on their website wasn't the picture of a delicious-looking bowl of tonkatsu ramen, but a hyperlink labeled \"Coupon\". I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings. Woot woot!\n\nFree food makes me happy, and free-food-related happiness makes me more inclined to give a good rating--which may be why Genki Ramen gets 3-stars instead of 2. (Because really, in Yelp words, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".)\n\nMy friend and I chose the CRISPY DAIMARU out of sheer curiousity as to what they were. What we got were 3 crispy deep-fried disc-shaped raviolis filled with cream cheese, spinach, and fish cake. They were served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though.

Whatever the case, hmph...I'm glad I had appetizers to munch on in the meanwhile. Didn't taste the garlic much, but the ribs were heavenly! Dear gawsh. So tender.

I thought it was pointless and wasn't worth the trouble, so I didn't get it.\n\nTheir ramen is their claim to fame, since it's clearly in the store name. To be honest though, I thought it was mediocre ramen.\n\n:::Pros:::\n     - Not just 2 measly slices of pork \n     - Broth was pretty good\n:::Cons::: \n     - Noodles were soggy and 'cheap'\n     - Low broth to noodle ratio\n     - Prices were high for the quality and quantity\n     - Fairly small amount in the bowl\n\nNone of the fried appetizers were anything to be proud of either.

When you bite through the crust and finally get to the filling, it's sorta worth it. A little like imitation crab with spinach. To be fair, this was a free dish so I won't complain too much, but I would be pretty pissed if I paid for this.\n:::Takoyaki::: looks really delicious, nicely fried, and had a good taste. It was a whole different story once you bite into it. The batter tasted underfried, and there is only 1 little piece of octopus :\\ quite sad. I ended up taking bites of it just to look for the octopus piece and left a bunch of half-eaten takoyaki halves on my plate. \n\nThis is one of those places you come for the ambiance, music, colors on the wall, LCD screens, and the fact that it probably won't get too crowded.

Genki is located on a busy street so do try to find parking in the neighboring streets but be warned that it spent me a half hour or more each time I've gone. \n\nHAPPY HOUR IS COOL. $3 appetizers including Takoyaki (6 pieces) and $3 drinks like Watermelon juice, which tastes fresh, and the Matcha Swirl, which is like a Matcha Frappucino. \n\nSERVICE IS FAST.

However, there are TVs on each wall so you're highly entertained while eating. \n\nThey have a LOT of choices of ramen (around $9). The noodles themselves look like they came from the ramen packages but the broths are very flavorful. Do try the House Special Char Shu if it's your first time! Chicken Karaage is good since they give you a lot of the fried chicken on the side. Shoga Niku is also very good but note that the stir fried flavor does overpower the broth. And my fav is the Beef Stew because I think that the portion of meat to noodles is just right. All the portions are just enough to make you happy. \n\nI love their Okonomiyaki! It's a huge portion so it's easy to share and the flavor is really good! \n\nI didn't like their Yakisoba. It is a giant mound of noodles stir fried with meat and vegetables on a sizzling platter but it does get very salty after awhile. I kept guzzling my water.

They just didn't have enough springiness to them and I found they were slightly overcooked.

I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings.

Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything.

The gyoza came as 5 pieces (usually $4.95) which were good, but mishapened.  They were not nicely crimped.  Looked as if it was your kid's first attempt to fold and make, like rectangularish-crecents.  The sesame wings (4 pieces) were OK.  I'd try something else next time over this.\nWe had 2 ramen:\n1. Chasu, $8.95.  Came with 5 large slices rounded, boiled, flavorless pork.  THe broth was OK, but you can do better at other places.  Also had bamboo and 1/2 marinated egg in it.  I added corn and seaweed for $1 extra for each.  Plenty full.\n2. Hubby had chicken kaarage, $8.50.

Like a good little Yelper, I looked at their Yelp review page before I left work. From there, I clicked on their website. The first thing that caught my eye on their website wasn't the picture of a delicious-looking bowl of tonkatsu ramen, but a hyperlink labeled \"Coupon\". I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings. Woot woot!\n\nFree food makes me happy, and free-food-related happiness makes me more inclined to give a good rating--which may be why Genki Ramen gets 3-stars instead of 2.

What we got were 3 crispy deep-fried disc-shaped raviolis filled with cream cheese, spinach, and fish cake. They were served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything. It didn't make my lips smack and I've definitely had better.\n\nAlas, my search for the best ramen in SF goes on...", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-09-28"}], "pumpkin n yam tempura": [], "beef n enoki roll": [], "baked scallop": [{"excerpts": ["*Baked Scallop-Yummy but small\n"], "author": "Chelsey G.", "review": "Kept seeing this place on grub hub and just ignoring it.

When you bite through the crust and finally get to the filling, it's sorta worth it. A little like imitation crab with spinach. To be fair, this was a free dish so I won't complain too much, but I would be pretty pissed if I paid for this.\n:::Takoyaki::: looks really delicious, nicely fried, and had a good taste. It was a whole different story once you bite into it. The batter tasted underfried, and there is only 1 little piece of octopus :\\ quite sad.

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I selected the deep fried Chicken Karaage and the Chashu Ramen with the addition of corn.

The interior is quite nice with soft avocado green tones, dim lighting, comfortable custom-made chairs with high back support and flat panel televisions throughout airing CNN and the Food Network (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=skSB5mgp0CCRpY6zD-I-8g).

I asked about the seafood sampler appetizer dish, but the waitress quite honestly told me it might be too much food (along with an order of ramen) for one person.  I selected the deep fried Chicken Karaage and the Chashu Ramen with the addition of corn.  There are about a dozen items you can add to your ramen, for additional costs of course.\n\nThe wait was quite lengthy for the food to arrive.

I allowed the ramen to sit a bit while I sampled the chicken appetizer.  Maybe I expected more than just deep fried chunks of lightly battered chicken thigh meat.  Just slightly tastier than an order of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, the moist chicken chunks arrived with a drizzling of sauce.  I couldn't make out what that sauce was because the chicken was so salty that it overpowered the sauce.  I've never been more thankful for that cup of complimentary hot tea.\n\nThe Chashu Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=pmSWIkmZMvpLcwD7pE9TMw) was much better.

It actually has pushed me to do pick up there a lot.

I haven't read the other reviews for this joint, and maybe other people are put off by the decor, too, but I really don't understand why this place is rated 3 and half stars. It should be at least 4, if not 4 and half, especially in light of the fact that there are not many places in SF to find a consistently good to great bowl of ramen. I've had at least half of the ramen dishes there, and 3/4's of them have been fantastic. Here's a list of my faves: \nSpicy Mabu Ramen - hands down my favorite dish here. I get it about half the time I come. Not gonna leave your mouth on fire, but if you're spice-phobic/ a wuss, I would stay away.\nTan tan, Negi beef, and Shoga Niku are probably my next favorite dishes here. I'm not one who can describe tastes very well, but suffice it to say, these are all excellent, in my opinion. Surprisingly, their Chashu Ramen has never knocked my socks off.\n\nI'd say their Okonomiyaki is really good, and their yakisoba is pretty good. I'll occasionally order one of those dishes to switch it up, but normally I go for the ramen. \n\nTheir Robatayaki is pretty awesome - it's just a little pricey for what you get - however, if you have a couple extra bucks to spend, it's worth trying any one (or more) of their Robatayaki with your Ramen.\n\nOnce again, if the atmosphere were any less obnoxious it would be a hands down 5 stars in my book, but even still, it's one of my favorite Ramen spots in the city.

I avoided the other weird fusion ramen abominations (curry tonkatsu ramen WTF???), deciding to go for something much more pedestrian. I also skipped on the various toppings that were on offer like corn and extra chashu.\n\nThe slices of chashu had a nice sweet, ginger soy marinade taste, but it was a bit on the salty side. It probably sat in the stewing liquid for too long. Same goes for the shoyu egg as well.\n\nStandard issue menma tasted fine. Their beni-shoga topping was straight from the jar. Standard foodservice stuff. No complaints there.\n\nThe soup seemed to be a tonkotsu style broth, light milky brown in color from the marrow and collagen that comes from hours of cooking down pork bones. Well, I'm assuming that. For I know, they're just serving up pre-made foodservice broth.\n\nAt any rate, the broth was served nice and hot. Perfect foil for a cold evening. The slices of scallions added a nice kick to the proceedings.\n\nThe noodles came out firm as requested. Nice. They tasted fine. Not too eggy or day-glo yellow like noodles you see sometimes in other establishments.\n\nThe portion size seemed a bit small, but not too small. I'll have to ask if I can order extra noodles next time. Don't recall seeing the option on the menu tho'.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Especially if you are drunk and craving something hot, salty and oily. Definitely a better option in my book than a slice of 'za from Nizario's up the street.\n\nI would go on a limb to say that Genki's ramen is probably better than the offerings at Halu, Katana-Ya, Oyaji, or Tampopo. At $9, it's not a bad deal.\n\nBut then again, that's like picking the lesser of all evils ramen-wise in San Francisco.\n\nI think I'll come back again and check out the other goodies on their menu.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-12-23"}, {"excerpts": ["has to have that succulent pungent broth, especially for the Chashu Ramen, GENKI RAMEN doesn't have that succulent pungent Chashu broth.

From there, I clicked on their website. The first thing that caught my eye on their website wasn't the picture of a delicious-looking bowl of tonkatsu ramen, but a hyperlink labeled \"Coupon\". I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings. Woot woot!\n\nFree food makes me happy, and free-food-related happiness makes me more inclined to give a good rating--which may be why Genki Ramen gets 3-stars instead of 2. (Because really, in Yelp words, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".)\n\nMy friend and I chose the CRISPY DAIMARU out of sheer curiousity as to what they were. What we got were 3 crispy deep-fried disc-shaped raviolis filled with cream cheese, spinach, and fish cake. They were served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything.

Anyway, my little ordered the chashu ramen and my twin and I both got the curry tonkatsu.\n\nNow, after living in Japan for four months and tasting the most amazing ramen (and other japanese dishes for that matter) ever, I prepared myself for mediocre food.  Which, is not to say that far off.  The ramen was a little undercooked in my opinion (I'm used to super soft noodles), rather chewy... but otherwise tasted pretty good.  The curry tonkatsu was on point but not enough curry for all the rice.  Mmm.  And I love, love, love milk tea... so I ordered one without caramel.  It's the closest thing I've found to my favorite brand back in Nippon.\n\n3 stars for the so-so food, +1 for the wide variety on the menu of nihon tabemono staples (which I will definitely be back to try - i.e. okonomiyaki), -1 for the confusing decor.", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-12-10"}, {"excerpts": ["can't resist the Chashu ramen in the tonkotsu broth.

Genki Ramen is like Randy Moss.  When you first look at him, he looks like the best receiver in the league.  Upon a closer examination, you realize that there is something slightly wrong with him.  If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.  When you eat it, some are very good, but others have some fatal frauds.  They make mistakes that normal Japanese chef would never make, which suggests that the chef is not Japanese.  If you know how to avoid these landmines, Genki could be very useful.  Of course, if you are not an expert in Japanese cuisine, you will probably not notice these mistakes, so you might enjoy their food without any issues, which is a good thing.   \n\nHOW TO USE GENKI:\n* Go there for lunch, order Chashu ramen ($8) with $1 fried rice and $1 gyoza.\n* Go there with friends, order a bunch of grilled robata-yaki items and enjoy them with Kirin or Sapporo draft.\n\nHITS:\nOkonomiyaki - While not perfect, it was pretty good.\nCharcoal grilled items, including Chicken Gizzard\nHomemade gyoza\nPumpkin and Yam tempura\nUjikintoki - nice dessert\n\nLANDMINES:\nGrilled onigiri - what the ?!?

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I went with the curry tonkatsu ramen based on yelp reviews while my sister got the chasu ramen - no extras. ", "Got the free side dish of chicken karaage. "], "author": "Liana L.", "review": "I actually think it's hard to compare ramen places when the selections offered are different from place to place. In the end it's always based largely on my personal preference for the soup base, then comes the less important stuff like the actual texture of the ramen, the ingredients and the price of all the extras I want to add into it. My fave soup base is easily spicy garlic miso or tonkatsu... so when you don't offer that, you're out of the running for 5 stars in my book.\n\nI went with the curry tonkatsu ramen based on yelp reviews while my sister got the chasu ramen - no extras. Got the free side dish of chicken karaage. The large piece of tonkatsu was super crispy and hot... pretty damn good! Noodles were soft and chewy to my liking. I thought the soup base was really good at first, but it must've been the curry flavor mixed in with the red ginger that got to me towards the end. I felt sick after eating it and I didn't even have that much ramen in my bowl.\n\nAfter tasting my soup, I could barely taste the soup flavor in my sister's bowl. She said it was good, but she does favor the milkier soup bases a la Daikokuya over, for example, Ramen Dojo's. Don't be fooled though, it was a lot less flavorful than Daikokuya's tonkatsu base. Her chasu was the kind I like - part fat, part moist meat.\n\nThe chicken karaage reminded us of Popeye's chicken strips... same batter except it was dark instead of white meat. It arrived with the sauce drizzled on top but it wasn't enough! Nothing special. If it wasn't free, I wouldn't have ordered it. \n\nEh. If I were in the area and was really craving ramen, maybe I'd come back and try the garlic tenderous rib one.

Sheesh, talk about stacking the deck against myself! I hate going to restaurants when it's slow and near closing time, because kitchen staff typically are more focused on cleaning up the kitchen rather than their cooking. But due to some logistical issues I won't go into, I found myself in the restaurant, hungry and cold.\n\nWell, since they have an exhibition kitchen, I could see all their moves. And they seemed to be focused on their cooking, thank gawd, as the last thing you want is errant splashes of Clorox in your broth.\n\nI prefer my ramen noodles firm, so I specified that for kicks on my order. I chuckled to myself when I saw my server run into the kitchen to make the notation on my ticket. I suppose their order entry system doesn't account for noodle doneness. This was interesting, as the menu mentions in a footnote that you can specify the oil/fat content and the firmness of the noodle, which was a nice gesture suggesting that the restauranteur did some research into ramen.\n\nAt any rate, I had their #401, their chashu ramen, and it was decent. I avoided the other weird fusion ramen abominations (curry tonkatsu ramen WTF???), deciding to go for something much more pedestrian. I also skipped on the various toppings that were on offer like corn and extra chashu.\n\nThe slices of chashu had a nice sweet, ginger soy marinade taste, but it was a bit on the salty side. It probably sat in the stewing liquid for too long. Same goes for the shoyu egg as well.\n\nStandard issue menma tasted fine. Their beni-shoga topping was straight from the jar. Standard foodservice stuff. No complaints there.\n\nThe soup seemed to be a tonkotsu style broth, light milky brown in color from the marrow and collagen that comes from hours of cooking down pork bones. Well, I'm assuming that. For I know, they're just serving up pre-made foodservice broth.\n\nAt any rate, the broth was served nice and hot. Perfect foil for a cold evening. The slices of scallions added a nice kick to the proceedings.\n\nThe noodles came out firm as requested. Nice. They tasted fine. Not too eggy or day-glo yellow like noodles you see sometimes in other establishments.\n\nThe portion size seemed a bit small, but not too small. I'll have to ask if I can order extra noodles next time. Don't recall seeing the option on the menu tho'.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Especially if you are drunk and craving something hot, salty and oily. Definitely a better option in my book than a slice of 'za from Nizario's up the street.\n\nI would go on a limb to say that Genki's ramen is probably better than the offerings at Halu, Katana-Ya, Oyaji, or Tampopo. At $9, it's not a bad deal.\n\nBut then again, that's like picking the lesser of all evils ramen-wise in San Francisco.\n\nI think I'll come back again and check out the other goodies on their menu.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-12-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I went on and ordered the curry tonkatsu ramen.

Genki Ramen is like Randy Moss.  When you first look at him, he looks like the best receiver in the league.  Upon a closer examination, you realize that there is something slightly wrong with him.  If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.  When you eat it, some are very good, but others have some fatal frauds.  They make mistakes that normal Japanese chef would never make, which suggests that the chef is not Japanese.  If you know how to avoid these landmines, Genki could be very useful.  Of course, if you are not an expert in Japanese cuisine, you will probably not notice these mistakes, so you might enjoy their food without any issues, which is a good thing.   \n\nHOW TO USE GENKI:\n* Go there for lunch, order Chashu ramen ($8) with $1 fried rice and $1 gyoza.\n* Go there with friends, order a bunch of grilled robata-yaki items and enjoy them with Kirin or Sapporo draft.\n\nHITS:\nOkonomiyaki - While not perfect, it was pretty good.\nCharcoal grilled items, including Chicken Gizzard\nHomemade gyoza\nPumpkin and Yam tempura\nUjikintoki - nice dessert\n\nLANDMINES:\nGrilled onigiri - what the ?!? Genki's version was really bad.\nNoodle pouch - ???  It looked good.\nPapaya salad - forget it.\n\nATMOSPHERE:  Who decided to install 5 flat-screen TVs?  Is this Best Buy or a ramen shop?  If you get past this confusion, it's actually the nicest looking ramen place in San Francisco.  J-POP videos included Otsuka Ai, Goto Maki, Country Musume, Morning Musume, and an episode of Music Station.   \n\nPRICE:  Nice value!

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The shrimp tempura ramen and chicken karaage ramen are my favorites, although I find it odd that the \"shrimp\" tempura ramen comes with only 2 shrimp, but 3 or 4 slices of veggie tempura.

Most of the time I dine here during dinner. The atmosphere is really cool and almost mysterious. Check the website for a monthly coupon, usually valid for a free appetizer during dinner. However, I must dock one star because the service is not up to par. Refilling tea takes forever and most of the time, the servers ignore your table. Exhibit A: I was holding the check for a few minutes before the waiters standing around the bar chatting finally got the note.\n\nI love the tea that's served here. I drink cups and cups of it every time. As for the main entree, I've tried the butter & corn ramen, chashu ramen, shrimp tempura ramen, and chicken kaarage ramen. I think the noodles used to be better quality (thicker) since my chicken kaarage ramen seemed to have finer noodles during lunch today. The chicken kaarage was fried to perfection. I can't wait for my face to breakout, wait, it already is. \n\nI also opt for the yakisoba entrees when I'm not down for ramen in soup. Now, the yakisoba is smothered in oil so be warned! My friends and I refer to yakisoba as \"oily goodness\" and it's basically stir-fried ramen with mixed veggies, cabbage, and whatever other ingredient you choose (beef, chashu, kimchi, spicy, etc.) I've tried the kimchi and spicy yakisoba dishes and both are good. The portions aren't fulfilling enough for me, though. This goes for both soup ramen and yakisoba. It might be best to go with an appetizer. During happy hour (3-7pm) many appetizers are $3, but for lunch combinations with soup ramen, an additional $1 will get you either: 2 pcs gyoza (pot stickers), chashu fried rice, or chicken kaarage.

In addition, the lunch menu is good 7 days a week until 5pm.  They have a good selection of food on their menu.  You can get the lunch special ramen for about $7.95  and add a side dish for just $1 more.  That would be 2 gyozas or 2-3 pieces of chicken karage.  We asked how big the happy hour size was for the same dishes, she said it was a little bigger so we opted for happy hour portions.  The two of us ordered way too much food.  They gave us 6 gyoza, and a whole plate of karage for just $3 a dish.  Not bad for the size.  We also ordered the croquettes- 2 McDonald's hash brown sized croquettes on a plate.\n \nI ordered the chasu ramen that comes with the basic tonkatsu broth and my friend ordered the kimchi ramen.

At first sight, this place looks really franchise-like.  They appear to take a page from the book of Aijisen.  It's interesting to see a sign that they cater, comes off as a bad sign to me.  There's a clipboard waiting list in the front after entering the doorway.  On the day we went, the clipboard wasn't needed.  We were sat immediately and upon checking in saw there was an offer for free edamame or chicken karaage.        \n\nOn this ramen outing, I actually got my parents to come with us.  That was a nice change of pace.  It's always a funny sight to see my parents react to food they don't necessarily eat on a normal basis.  While my parents only shared a bowl of chicken teriyaki which came with miso and a salad, we went to the route of ramen of course.  Little Bun ordered the nori ramen combo with pork fried rice and I got the chicken karaage ramen combo with gyoza (comes with two).   \n\nThe ramen looked fine at first glance, until further investigation things were different than they appear.  The taste of it didn't do the presentation justice.  Like a less than half filled reservoir during drought season, the bowl was big; what was inside wasn't as much as one would visually expect.  The chicken karaage, placed on a separate plate, was appetizing enough.  The coat of batter wasn't overdone and not overly oily.  Regrettably, I can't be as positive about the ramen.  The noodles lacked the chewiness expectant of awesome noodles; texture of it felt overcooked.  Due to the lack of other ingredients, the broth was forced to be the epicenter.  Regrettably, the broth couldn't shoulder a more favorable overall approval with a flat lining flavor that was satisfactory at best.  \n\nBecause of the area, my expectations were slightly raised.  Most of the disappointing points were derived from that notion of thinking.  I may be harsh in critique, but there are some encouraging aspects.  The ramen combinations are good deals.  It'll definitely fill the stomach at an affordable price.  There's a check-in offer however long it may last.

There was another place I heard of and it was this place, just down the street from where my friend lived.\n\nI got really excited because I saw that they had spicy mabo tofu ramen, something they don't have at Tadamasa near my place, and it's my absolute favorite ramen ever. I ordered it with a side of chicken karage and it was pleasantly surprised! The broth was full of flavor and it was actually thicker than usual, which I liked. However, as I was finishing the ramen I started to realize that it was a little sweeter than I'm used to. Towards the end of my soup, I was craving more of a salty flavor with more of a punch with the spice. But regardless, I still enjoyed the ramen and the chicken karage was quite tasty as well. \n\nStill nothing that trumps my all-time favorite ramen place, Foo Foo Tei, in the LA area but I still need to try Katana-Ya.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-07-11"}, {"excerpts": ["For my main order I decided to try their Spicy Mabo Tofu Ramen, which consisted of stir fried spicy soft silken tofu and minced pork in a Tonkatsu base.

It looked and sounded like a lounge/club with the dimly lit lights, TV screens, and chill beats playing over the speakers. Indeed, I might have entered a Ramen Lounge, something I expected to find in Los Angeles or New York and not in San Francisco.\n\nThe modern vibe of the restaurant reflects itself on the menu. There were non-traditional types of Ramen aside from more traditional Japanese items like Okonomiyaki, Rice Dishes, Yakisoba, and grilled Meat Skewers.\n\nGenki Ramen has a promotion lasting until the end of the month of March where you can get a FREE order of Crispy Daimaru or Edamame with your meal. I started off with the Crispy Daimaru that comes with 3 disc-shaped fried dumplings with a sweet sauce on the side. These are filled with cheese, fish cake, and spinach. When I bit into the center, the cream cheese filling was soft and oozing out. I probably won't order this normally, but it was worth trying. \n\nFor my main order I decided to try their Spicy Mabo Tofu Ramen, which consisted of stir fried spicy soft silken tofu and minced pork in a Tonkatsu base. I really enjoyed the flavor of the dish and it really packed a spicy punch. I wasn't particularly fond of the ramen noodles though. They just didn't have enough springiness to them and I found they were slightly overcooked. On the side, my server also provided me with a small dish of pickled vegetables. \n\nI commend Genki Ramen for delivering new variations on the traditional ramen. On the other hand, I just wasn't very keen on the noodles in my dish.

If the quality of the food is of such high caliber, I guess the temperature could be secondary...maybe. But when it's middling to begin with, why add insult to injury by making the broth just a cut above room temperature? That's what happened when I ordered their house special, the $9.75 bowl of Garlic Tenderous Rib Ramen. The tonkotsu broth would have been so much more flavorful if they bothered to light a switch under the burner.\n\nThe roasted garlic and spinach were fine, but the concept of \"pork soft bone\" threw me since I nearly cracked a molar with some of the pieces swimming in the broth (photo: http://bit.ly/16lfIe6). I also went for a pair of the Robatayaki barbecue skewers which I found a bit overpriced for the paltry amount of meat provided. The $4.50 Lamb Chop with Mint Sauce was barely a lamb chop with little trace of the mint sauce. I was about to call in CSI when it dawned on me that the mint could have been in the marinade. A more reasonable deal could be found in the $2.75 Pork Neck with Soy Sauce where assume to innards of a pig's esophagus were threaded onto the stick (photo: http://bit.ly/11oWVxJ).\n\nI frankly liked both skewers but they were gone so soon. An added bonus came by way of my virginal check-in which yielded a \"Free Daruna Tofu or Edamame\" coupon which had me shoving my iPhone into the young waitress's confused face. She informed me in an indifferent tone that the free deal that evening would be a pair of Potato Croquettes (normally $4.50) (photo: http://bit.ly/10JY9Ms). I was disheartened by the prospect since I had a flashback to a classic Yasujiro Ozu film where the unmarried daughter came home to her traditional Japanese family much too late to have dinner with them and could only have croquettes with rice before going to bed.\n\nThis sad scene of rejection was accompanied by the moan of a mournful oboe indicating how the daughter lost face as she nibbled on her croquette. But when my croquettes arrived, I actually enjoyed them. They reminded me of the pocket hash browns you get at McDonald's but less greasy. I actually meant that as a compliment.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that the Takoyaki and Seafood Okonomiyaki were pretty decent as well - both had a good amount of octopus/seafood and were cooked quite nicely.

But after a long deliberation, I went with number 412 on the menu, Beef Stew Ramen made with tender, braised beef brisket, spinach, red ginger, served in a tonkatsu base.

My noodles were a nicely prepared dish with beef that was nicely sliced and prepared as it were pork belly the only drawback is that I wish there were more noodles in my dish to go with all of that excess beef broth. My dining mates' pancake looked unique enough almost like a Japanese pizza, but here too I thought the quantity of food here was lacking.

When I actually came to try the place out, it's not as out-of-reach as I thought it was.\n\nI usually grab the chashu or the beef ramen bowl as a meal to have the side dishes and tried all three sides out (popcorn chicken, gyoza, fried rice) and my favorite is the gyoza. After having the chashu dish for sometime, however, I felt like there was some weird funky odor or taste to it so I started to order the beef ramen. Other favorite dishes that I love ordering from here is the croquette and especially the grilled ika yaki!!! Whenever I can find grilled squid, I try my best to get my hand on it! Although it's almost $10, I feel like it's so worth it because it's grilled just right and isn't dried out or hard or anything. I've also had their samurai wings (which is pretty juicy), takoyaki (not too great of a deal, there's like 1 or 2 pieces of octopus in there; more dough than octopus), agedashi or fried tofu (also not too great of a deal, you get 4 tiny pieces, or 2 cut in half), and also beef stew ramen (it soaks up the soup too much so I didn't really like it).\n\nOn my first visit here, they were trying really hard to promote their watermelon slush drink and so I got it. This better have been the best watermelon juice drink I've ever had because it was $4 fir about 8-12oz and although I admit it was tasty, I can't say I'd want to grab it again because of the price.\n\nThis place also offers extra ramen or soup (+$1-$2 extra or so) so if you prefer to so it's good for those with big appetites.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-01-08"}, {"excerpts": ["EB usually gets the beef stew ramen.

I rarely leave my neighborhood (TL Heights) so coming out to the Inner Richmond was a treat for me, almost like going to another city really.\nGenki Ramen was about half full when we arrived, we were quickly seated and had to choose from the numerous choices on the menu. What I quickly discovered is this was not the typical Japanese restaurant that I frequent; Mifune in Japan Town and Kyoto on VanNess. I was in the mood for udon or soba noodle but only saw Ramen. Ok, so that just meant I had to open up my culinary mind and enjoy the culinary ride.\n\nWe started with the Chicken Yakisoba which is kind of like a Japanese Crepe only thicker and served hot on a pizza like skillet that comes with a little spatula to serve. For my first time having this dish I have to say it was my least favorite. I thought the dough/batter was too mushy like an undercooked pancake. The chicken was flavorless and the dried seaweed served on top as a garnish made it to \"fishy\" tasting. I'm glad I tried it but wasn't doing it for me. \nThe next item was scallops in butter and garlic. I am not a fan of scallops but Irv and his friend from Germany seemed like them, lets just say none were left behind. I ordered the shitake mushroom served with soy sauce, three good sized mushrooms were served on a wooden pick, nicely cooked al dente'; I definitely like them.\nNext we ordered grilled lamb chops served with a mint sauce, not mint jelly, there's a difference. These were grilled perfectly, moist, not gamey tasting and the mint sauce added that extra something special to the chops.\nOur final dish and only because I needed some carbs was the Curry Beef Ramen. A healthy portion was brought to us with slices of beef, carrot, green onion, potato in a miso base. It tasted alright but I felt it needed some spice so when I asked our waitress for something to spice it up she brought me a bottle of Sri Racha sauce, anyone who loves spice has a bottle of this in their fridge like I do.

At least the karaage was solid and tasted like zesty popcorn chicken, drizzled with the delicious sweet sauce that typically accompanies croquettes.\n\nI'm very close to giving this 3 stars because you dine comfortably here. The ambiance is modern and spacious, featuring lime green and dark wooden chairs each branded with the restaurant name and Kanji character--maybe the ramen here is on the pricey side in order to cover the cost of the custom chairs.\n\nThe service unfortunately bumps it down.

The waitresses are also very efficient in taking your order and giving you your check.\n\nThe place is also pretty big so you do get seated pretty quickly.

However, there are TVs on each wall so you're highly entertained while eating. \n\nThey have a LOT of choices of ramen (around $9). The noodles themselves look like they came from the ramen packages but the broths are very flavorful. Do try the House Special Char Shu if it's your first time! Chicken Karaage is good since they give you a lot of the fried chicken on the side. Shoga Niku is also very good but note that the stir fried flavor does overpower the broth.

It's a huge portion so it's easy to share and the flavor is really good! \n\nI didn't like their Yakisoba. It is a giant mound of noodles stir fried with meat and vegetables on a sizzling platter but it does get very salty after awhile. I kept guzzling my water. Also, no on the Crispy Seafood Roll because it's not worth the price and the taste is bitter.

Simple and easy. I wish all delivery places had a system like this.\n\nNow on to the food. For starters my roommate and I had the Pumpkin & Yam Tempura and the Baked Scallops. The tempura was soggy and incredibly oily. This could have been result of us ordering take out and not eating it fresh at the restaurant. Regardless the pieces were also cut really small. The Baked Scallops on the other hand were pretty delicious. Those scallops were pretty tiny, but the garlic butter it is cooked in made up for it.\n\nI also ordered the Seafood Yakisoba. This was pretty bad. The noodles were pretty bland and incredibly greasy. I had to add soy sauce to give this dish flavor. In my opinion if food tastes good you don't need to add anything extra to it. This was not the case here. The seafood pieces were small and mostly imitation crab. My roommate ordered the Curry Tonkatsu rice plate. The curry itself and the katsu cutlets were pretty good. But the entire dish is made up of mostly just rice.\n\nThe food we ordered was not very good. Despite its poor showing, I would still give Genki Ramen one more chance.

Though I'm pretty sure the ramen all falls under 10 bucks, I don't think the prices quite match up to what you get (or, what you don't)--I'd love it to see them a wee bit cheaper (of course, I'm the biggest cheapskate ever so I'm not sure if this is helpful).\n\nIn addition to ramen, they have yakisoba (fried noodles) and okonomiyaki (eggy floury pancake full of yummy things). For a good deal and something different, go for the seafood okonomiyaki topped with ramen noodles and bonito flakes--*nom nom nom*.\n\nMy other slight beef with Genki is that the service tends to be really slow. But I'm pretty sure it's because it's one of those places where Asian kids come and chill out foreverrrrrrrr and never leave (I think the plasma tv screens and the trendy interior have something to to do with it). So even though I tend to be a faster-paced Asian, I guess I can forgive this factor.", "rating": 3, "date": "2009-04-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Then, it's time to dig in: Seafood Okonomiyaki, Seafood Fried Rice, Short Rib Skewers..."], "author": "Lily S.", "review": "I've been a regular at Genki Ramen for about two years now, and they have NEVER let me down!

What Genki does right is making impeccable fusion ramen, so don't come here expecting a solid bowl of traditional tonkotsu.\n\nGenki excels at blending flavors together, even superimposing dishes like Negi Beef and Shoga Niku on top of a bowl of ramen and having it work (which, incidentally, are my two favorite ramens at this place). The flavors are always delightful and super yummy. Granted, sometimes the ramen tastes so good that I wonder if I'm just having a healthy dose of MSG, but since I trust my tastebuds which are essentially ultra-sensitive detectors (I get super thirsty an hour afterwards), it so far passes my test.\n\nVery broadly, the appetizers are so-so (but great during Happy Hour when they are discounted), yakisoba and okonomiyaki are alright, but the ramens - ALL OF THEM - are fantastic.

Genki Ramen is like Randy Moss.  When you first look at him, he looks like the best receiver in the league.  Upon a closer examination, you realize that there is something slightly wrong with him.  If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.  When you eat it, some are very good, but others have some fatal frauds.  They make mistakes that normal Japanese chef would never make, which suggests that the chef is not Japanese.  If you know how to avoid these landmines, Genki could be very useful.  Of course, if you are not an expert in Japanese cuisine, you will probably not notice these mistakes, so you might enjoy their food without any issues, which is a good thing.   \n\nHOW TO USE GENKI:\n* Go there for lunch, order Chashu ramen ($8) with $1 fried rice and $1 gyoza.\n* Go there with friends, order a bunch of grilled robata-yaki items and enjoy them with Kirin or Sapporo draft.\n\nHITS:\nOkonomiyaki - While not perfect, it was pretty good.\nCharcoal grilled items, including Chicken Gizzard\nHomemade gyoza\nPumpkin and Yam tempura\nUjikintoki - nice dessert\n\nLANDMINES:\nGrilled onigiri - what the ?!?

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["The onigiri unagi grilled had a little too much sauce for my taste.

Like a good little Yelper, I looked at their Yelp review page before I left work. From there, I clicked on their website. The first thing that caught my eye on their website wasn't the picture of a delicious-looking bowl of tonkatsu ramen, but a hyperlink labeled \"Coupon\". I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings. Woot woot!\n\nFree food makes me happy, and free-food-related happiness makes me more inclined to give a good rating--which may be why Genki Ramen gets 3-stars instead of 2. (Because really, in Yelp words, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".)\n\nMy friend and I chose the CRISPY DAIMARU out of sheer curiousity as to what they were. What we got were 3 crispy deep-fried disc-shaped raviolis filled with cream cheese, spinach, and fish cake. They were served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything. It didn't make my lips smack and I've definitely had better.\n\nAlas, my search for the best ramen in SF goes on...", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-09-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Grilled Onigiri (charcoal grilled sea-eel rice ball):  ", "I *", "*heart", "** rice balls!

Genki Ramen is like Randy Moss.  When you first look at him, he looks like the best receiver in the league.  Upon a closer examination, you realize that there is something slightly wrong with him.  If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.  When you eat it, some are very good, but others have some fatal frauds.  They make mistakes that normal Japanese chef would never make, which suggests that the chef is not Japanese.  If you know how to avoid these landmines, Genki could be very useful.  Of course, if you are not an expert in Japanese cuisine, you will probably not notice these mistakes, so you might enjoy their food without any issues, which is a good thing.   \n\nHOW TO USE GENKI:\n* Go there for lunch, order Chashu ramen ($8) with $1 fried rice and $1 gyoza.\n* Go there with friends, order a bunch of grilled robata-yaki items and enjoy them with Kirin or Sapporo draft.\n\nHITS:\nOkonomiyaki - While not perfect, it was pretty good.\nCharcoal grilled items, including Chicken Gizzard\nHomemade gyoza\nPumpkin and Yam tempura\nUjikintoki - nice dessert\n\nLANDMINES:\nGrilled onigiri - what the ?!?

Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-05-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I am definitely looking forward to try their baked scallop, curry entrees, chashu fried rice, and their grilled onigiri."], "author": "Erica J.", "review": "Speaking as a person who has tried ramen all over Asia, I can't say that I'm impressed with Genki's ramen.
