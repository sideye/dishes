Onion rings are the frozen kind, but I was hungry and they were good. Mitchell's shake was creamy, although tasted small ice crystals in it, possibly a sign that the ice cream had accumulated some frost. But I'll note that they opted to keep the shake in the freezer while the food was prepared so it wouldn't melt. That's some good thinkin' right there. Service was fast, too, although they forgot the grilled onions on one of our burgers. \n\nThe place is pretty spacious, and actually nicely decorated. Plenty of street/metered parking right in front.

I ordered a mushroom burger with a side of onion rings and also decided to take the Mitchell's chocolate shake for a spin. \n\nVerdict: Not bad. Meat is advertised as Niman Ranch. People in SF seem to be obsessed with that Niman Ranch beef. Anywho, the burger was nice an juicy. It was topped off with grilled mushrooms, cheddar cheese, red onions, pickle slices, tomato, green lettuce, and mayo on a sesame seed bun. Overall a fairly average burger. Onion rings are the frozen kind, but I was hungry and they were good. Mitchell's shake was creamy, although tasted small ice crystals in it, possibly a sign that the ice cream had accumulated some frost. But I'll note that they opted to keep the shake in the freezer while the food was prepared so it wouldn't melt. That's some good thinkin' right there. Service was fast, too, although they forgot the grilled onions on one of our burgers. \n\nThe place is pretty spacious, and actually nicely decorated. Plenty of street/metered parking right in front.

This burger is like BigFoot to me, you see it at a burger place once, when you go, then you look for it at another burger joint and it's missing! Or the bread is wrong! Or the bread is not grilled or toasted! Or the burger patty is too tough! Or they put sauce in it! Ughhh!! I'm going crazy!\nThen There was a sighting of the legendary BigFoot Patty Melt. It was seen  resting on the menu of Tower burger! They have the legendary Patty Melt! They use Rye bread! Check! They butter and grill the bread! Check! They use Neiman Ranch beef! Check! They have Caramelized onions! Check! I Have found my BigFoot! It's one of the better patty melts I have had.\nIt's really juicy. The quality is tasted in every bite.
