Keep in mind that it is by the pier, so it's definitely a very touristy spot and generally very busy. I typically go at night (after 8pm) for free metered parking around Beach St and less crowd.\n\nI love this place so much!

Besides that, did you know about their secret non-published menu?  If not, then here you go!\n\nIn-N-Out Burger has a secret unpublished menu for insiders who are in-the-know. Next time you're at In-N-Out (i.e. tomorrow . . . or maybe tonight), order a bag of these off-the-menu specials:\n\n\"3-by-3\" = three meat patties and three slices of cheese.\n\n\"4-by-4\" = four meat patties and four slices of cheese.\n\n\"2-by-4\" = two meat patties and four slices of cheese.\n\n*Note: You may get a burger with the exact number of meat patties or cheese slices you want (up to 4x4). Just tell the In-N-Out Burger cashier how many meat patties and how much cheese you want and that is what you'll get! For instance, if you want 4 pieces of meat and 3 pieces of cheese tell them you want a \"4-by-3.\"\n\n\"Double Meat\" = like a Double Double without cheese.\n\n\"3 by Meat\" = three meat patties and no cheese.\n\n\"Animal Style\" = the meat is cooked and fried with mustard and then pickles are added, extra spread and grilled onions are added.\n\n\"Animal Style Fries\" = fries with cheese, spread, grilled onions and pickles (if you ask for them).\n\n\"Protein Style\" = for all you low-carbohydrate dieters, this is a burger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce).\n\n\"Flying Dutchman\" = two meat patties, two slices of melted cheese and nothing else - not even a bun!\n\nFries \"Well-Done\" = extra crispy fries . . . even better than the regular!\n\nFries \"Light\" = opposite of fries well-done, more raw than most people like 'em\n\n\"Grilled Cheese\" = no meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce and spread on a bun.\n\n\"Veggie Burger\" = burger without the patty or cheese. Sometimes we call this the \"Wish Burger.\"\n\n\"Neapolitan\" Shake = strawberry, vanilla and chocolate mixed together.\n\nThe friendly employees of In-N-Out Burger will take your special order without question, if you use the right terminology.

Call it hormonal rage, call it pre-holiday meltdown, call it just feeling particularly snippy; no matter what you call it, I wasn't in the greatest of moods. Of course, when you're feeling like this, it's a fantastic time for the perfected simplicity of In-N-Out. Nothing better than adding to feeling cranky, run down and chunky then eating a burger and fries! Seriously, my tastebuds alert my endorphines, who kick in and beat the concept of calories out of my head.\n\nYes, we in CA are spoiled by many many exclusives and In-N-Out, I'm sure is in the top hundred list of the majority of Californians. Still if you are from the Bay Area, you can recall that this chain didn't come to the bay until the late '90's. Yep even fellow Californians were deprived! But then again that's what road trips are for (that and buying shakes to drink with the windows down and the heater up--oh wait that might be just me).\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the In-N- Out chain, the menu is simple. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers and the infamous Double Doubles (double meat, double cheese). They come with lettuce, tomatoes, thousand Island and onions. You can request grilled onions and pickles at no extra cost but of course, if you are \"In-N-Out virgin\" (heh heh-sorry love a good double entendre) the way to go is to go \"Animal Style\". I'm not even gonna go into what animal style entails but trust me, your friends at home will be impressed when you told them. If you like your burgers with no fuss but are still curious to try animal style you can get your fries that way instead. Feel a little better about the reckless abandonment of your waistline by knowing your food was cooked in vegetable oil.    \n\nThis location has its pros and cons. There is no drive through and its in Fisherman's Wharf area next to Hooters. It is as busy as pretty much any other In-N-Out but instead of an assortment of locals, there is a healthy representation of tourists and homeless. Still it's also one of the only places in the wharf area where you can lunch for around $5 and the quality is par with many other In-N-Out across the state. If you know your In-N-Out at all, you know you're happily paying for a place with standards and damn it, if you don't have standards why are you reading a review in the first place???  \n\n(The burger and fries are gone now.

You can also order fries well-done or even with cheese or grilled onions. \n2. Ask for spread to dip with your fries or even add it to your burger!\n\nIn this particular location, the service is generally really fast. There may be a long wait for your order if it's during busy hours in the day (like lunch or dinner time). Keep in mind that it is by the pier, so it's definitely a very touristy spot and generally very busy. I typically go at night (after 8pm) for free metered parking around Beach St and less crowd.\n\nI love this place so much! It's the only fast food chain where I don't feel like I'm being clogged with oil after every meal.

Actually, the best way to get anything on the menu is probably animal style. If I was a soda drinker I'd probably get that animal style too.\n\nI'm gonna talk about what I don't like first, however; I just want to make it clear that In-N-Out, while good, is not the holy grail of burger places.\n\nSo the fries... they're just not good. They're not horrible, but they're not good. I like my fries to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and In-N-Out fries sorta do both in a mediocre way. Now, I'm aware you can get them well done, but trust me, I've had them regular, well done, and animal style, but they're still just meh.\n\nNext, I'm not sure if this is just pertinent to this one chain or not, but there's so much YELLING. The staff call out order numbers, but... there's a microphone. It's a little jarring when I'm deep into enjoying my burger and then I hear an order number being called in the same way my parents used to yell at me.\n\nThere is also a wait. Understandable because this location is at the Wharf, so every tourist combined with SF locals will be here. I don't think I've ever seen an hour where there was no lineup. It doesn't take long to get your order in, but waiting for your food takes a while.\n\nAll of these shortcomings I can forgive, however, because as soon as I take my first bite into a double double animal style burger, I forget. I forget that I had to wait 30 minutes, I forget that the fries are bad, and I forget that the yelling gives me flashbacks to when I got yelled at for not getting straight-A's. The juiciness of the fresh ground beef smashed patties, the mustard fried buns, the animal sauce... everything on that burger comes together and embraces me, letting me know that flaws are what make someone beautiful. I feel no shame in sometimes not eating for a whole day and then eating 3 double doubles in one sitting.\n\nMaybe this is why I keep going back.

Good thing the line was moving fairly quick. The thing that really caught my eye is how cheap everything on the menu was. Not even in terms of San Francisco prices, but like in general.

Because I'm from Hawaii where we have no In N Outs.  Because this is the only location in the city and we were already in the area.  Because its been five long and agonizing years since I had my last fix!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThey're located in Anchorage Square which is a shopping center so there's no drive thru.  Like most In N Outs, the inside is small and the crowds large, so seating was at a premium.  There was no organization at all as far as the ordering and pickup lines went, though the crowd seemed mindful of it all.  It's definitely not a relaxing dining experience as someone is always in your personal bubble space.  I wasn't planning on eating inside but my spouse found a counter seat for us.\n\nFOOD:\nDouble Double - Being an In N Out amateur, I forgot that you have to ask for GRILLED onions as the ones I got were yucky raw.  Other than picking them out, the burger was good but the patties were a tad salty.  I tried it animal style before but didn't care for it because I like my burgers simple, usually with just mayo.  However, not being a fan of their fries because they lack flavor, I was going to try them animal style but my spouse declined, so I was stuck with boring old fries.  I could've ordered my own but I was full on crab & chowder lol!\n\nSERVICE:\nFor being as bat ***t crazy as they were, all the workers were calm and collected.  The cashiers were especially friendly and patient.  My simple order took about 30 minutes from ordering to delivery.  \n\nTIP:\nDon't bother trying to guess if your order is up next because the numbers were random and not in numerical order.\n\nOVERALL:\nIt's not the best burger I've ever had, but it's pretty damn good for fast food, and a lot more affordable than their competition.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-12-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Get it animal style!

Good examples of this are Nordburger and Burger Theory. To be honest, I like Nordburger's patties better than in 'n' out's. In 'n' out's were a bit flat. Their buns were great, as was the lettuce and tomato and the pickled chili's were awesome; but I was a little underwhelmed. Also the fries were average, and I know that they make them fresh in store so maybe processed fries are just better tasting even though they are bad for you.\n\nIt was very good, but not the epic dining experience I was expecting.

Once he took her order he asked where she was from and where she worked and she hit him with a \" don't worry about it\" and the *GUY IN CHARGE* got all upset and told the boyfriend that he was \"sorry\" and had to \"take care of this\" and walked away leaving the boyfriend confused and an ever-growing line of now 20 out the door waiting with only ONE FRIGGIN CASH REGISTER OPEN!\n\nLove the animal style burgers and enjoyed them here but all in all this location is an absolute mess.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-05-24"}, {"excerpts": ["The burger patty was dry and devoid of ketchup and animal style sauce.

Normally that alone is a reason to avoid the place, but the No1DP gets a free pass as he fondly remembers this chain (my first recommendation to him days before we started dating) serving one of the most memorable burgers he's eaten. It's also one of the only three In-N-Outs in the US that doesn't have a drive-thru, which is counter to what In-N-Out stands for (\"do you want to eat this in your car\") but that also gets a free pass as there's already enough cars in the area as is. \n\nThe large Coke spill greeting us as we entered and the time it took for a staff member to clean it was the least of our issues. \n\nOur #2 combos with fries cooked well left much to be desired.

Just stick to eating clam chowder on bread bowls; though it's very touristy at least the food quality in even the most \"subpar\" restaurant is better than this sorry excuse of a burger.

(correct me if I'm wrong about M Burger, Chicago area residents and visitors who've been to one) The neopolitan shake was also great(mix of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry shakes together), and I think it'd help InO to have a second location somewhere else within SF, to reduce the crowds at this location. Agree the dining room often looked really packed, and why I always ordered my food to go each time I visited. Though honestly I admire the fact that the service was never too bad on any of my visits here, and they do seem to maintain decent service at this one, despite the big crowds it gets for being the only one within SF.\n\nIf I ever get to another InO(which I suspect one day I will), I'd like to see how their grilled cheese sandwich is like. In the end though(note I've never had a Shake Shack burger, and am only comparing it against other chains in this sentence), my verdict is that I liked the burger here more than Five Guys, but that I prefer Culver's for their burgers, and that both Culver's and Five Guys have better fries(looking at that aspect alone, sans animal style sauce). The animal style sauce is unique OTOH, and something where I wouldn't mind learning the recipe to make such a sauce on my own(lol).", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-05-10"}, {"excerpts": ["I arrived back at the hotel with a sack full of burgers - a Double Double Animal Style for me, and a Hamburger & fries for her, along with a pair of lemonades.

We had to wait for about 10 minutes or so to get our food.  The fries were already a little bit cold when we got everything.  The burger was delicious and very juicy.  I asked for extra spread (in-n-out's special sauce, kind of like big mac sauce) and was delicious on the burger. I would definitely say in-n-out's burger is on par with shake shack, but in my opinion, shake shack still has my #1 vote.  \n\nThe fries were extremely disappointing.  I think it would have been a better choice if I ordered them well done.  They were tasteless, limp, and just kind of gross.  I would think the well done fries would be much better.  The vanilla milkshake was rich and creamy.  \n\nThe best thing about in-n-out is the price.  Everything was under $5 (if i remember correctly).

A Five Guys bun tastes fresh and looks like it's actually made out of bread.\n\nBurger- way too salty and also overcooked (ie dry). At Five Guys the burger still manages to taste juicy despite the fact that you have no other option than medium-well (they say it's well-done but it's almost always medium-well). \n\nToppings/Condiments- No comparison here really, Five Guys wins out by a huge margin as far as customization within these two categories. Animal style certainly made the burger taste pretty awesome but overall it didn't seem like much more than a glorified Big Mac sauce.\n\nFries- I didn't have room for fries on this visit but the animal style fries looked amazing. I'm not all that impressed by the fries at Five Guys.\n\nShakes- The chocolate shake I had here was really tasty.

My favorite order is the double double with onions, no tomatoes with a fresh order of French Fries. The average wait is about 5-10 minutes depending on the time you eat there.

I'm not proud of it, but I figure it's time I come clean and face this problem head on like a man.  Thinking back, I guess I would say it all started when I was 13 years old.  You know, that's a very impressionable age, and I just wanted to be a part of the in-crowd.  I didn't enjoy doing it and I really didn't enjoy doing it with my friends.  I just wanted to fit in.  If I close my eyes and listen very carefully, I can still hear them talking to me: \n\n\"You gotta try this!\" \n\"It's amazing!\"  \n\"Everyone is hitting it up after school, you have to do this with us!\"\n\nAs I got older, things didn't change.  I was still living a lie, and every time I felt that peer pressure, I would give in to it.  Not anymore.  No sir...today Ray Bautista takes his life back and stops selling out.  TODAY, Ray Bautista is finally ready to admit that IN-N-OUT BURGER IS EXTREMELY OVERRATED! Seriously, it's sooooooo AVERAGE!  Ahh, that felt great.  All these years of living a lie and I finally feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  I know, I know, I'm from California.  Even just having these thoughts about In-N-Out is blasphemous, but what can I say, I'm a rebel.  Like James Dean, minus the cool hair, money, fame and good looks.\n\nSo why do I think it's so average you ask?  Peep it.\n\nFor starters, how about the taste?  Can any of you reading this review honestly say that there is a unique taste to their burgers or fries?  Seriously, I'm pretty sure I can make burgers and fries that taste just like this at my house (for those of you that doubt me, I got my Iron Chef hat ready for battle).  As much shit as my friends give big name fast food chains like McDonalds and Burger King, you all have to admit that there really is a distinct taste (even smell) to these franchises' food items.  I really don't believe that In-N-Out has these qualities in their food, but then again my palette is used to the finer things in life. And by finer things, I mean a Sourdough Jack meal from Jack In The Box at 3am in the morning.\n\nI know, I get it.  In-N-Out is synonymous with California and it's an easy, cheap place to bring your out-of-town guests too.  A majority of the time, your guests / friends will probably ask if you can take them there because they've heard so much about it.   Plus, who doesn't enjoy looking all hip and cool in front of an In-N-Out virgin by using that crazy In-N-Out slang while ordering, \"Yes, I'll have one Double Double, a 4x4, Animal Style with extra fry sauce please.\"  Yeah, I'm guilty of it just like everyone else, BUT all of this (including the secret menu) doesn't make the food taste any better.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are things about In-N-Out that I really, really like.  I don't think anyone can deny that their milkshakes are AMAZING. I gotta give them a lot of love for this.  The consistency is always perfect and the flavors are always dope.  If you've never had one, then you suck, and you should go get one right now!  I'd recommend getting either the Strawberry or Vanilla flavors for all those n00bs out there reading this review.  As Ray-Ray from 10 years ago would say, \"That shizzle is the bomb yo!\"\n\nAlso, In-N-Out's prices are pretty awesome.  You get a good amount of food for the price that you're paying and in my book, that's always a good thing.  I also like the look and layout of the restaurant.  Atmosphere is always important to me, and I have to say that In-N-Out got this right.\n\nThat's all folks!  That was my roller coaster ride review of In-N-Out Burger.  I hated some things, I loved some things, but the most important thing...I cared.  That's right fuckers, I cared enough to review In-N-Out Burger to begin with.  In the world of Yelp, that means a lot.  So in closing, I would just like to say that In-N-Out's burgers and fries are still SUPER AVERAGE.\n\nIn other words, stick to animal style condoms, not burgers.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-11-11"}, {"excerpts": ["You can't f*ck with Animal Style.\n\n"], "author": "Wes T.", "review": "This In-N-Out, like many others I have visited, absolutely rules.

A friendly In-N-Out team member was taking my order before I knew it and took my order as if it were written on the menu board right above my head. The wait to get my meal was a bit longer than I am used to at most fast-food joints, but then again few of these types of restaurants near to own home get quite this busy and none really put as much care into their burgers as these guys do. I made a quick exit as soon as my number was called and rushed to devour my order.

Then, one night at a party at Station 40 I was talking with someone and somehow In And Out burger came up...\n\nWell, does it even need to be said that I couldn't wait to try it?  Secret Menu!  Living wage and benefits for employees!  Crossed Palm tree things at most locations!  Cryptic hidden bible verses on cups!  I absolutely had to go to In and Out, but first I checked out the secret menu on their website so I could be prepared.  It's there I learned that In and Out has a commitment to fresh, quality ingredients, and that's why they're only in Southern California (and a few up here...)  I was down.\n\nOn my first visit to In And Out, I prepared myself, walked up the the register and said \"Hi, I've never been to In And Out before.\"  The cashier gets this discernably quizzical look on her face, yet, a look of recognition, and says. \"okay...\"  I proceed to order a Grilled Cheese, animal style, Animal Fries and a shake.  When she asks what kind of shake I would like, I kind of nerdily hold up a finger, and with what surely must have been a twinkle in my eye, replied \"Neopolitan.\"  I confirmed with her that nothing I ordered had any meat in it, took my number, and sat down and waited.\n\nThis great thing happened while I was waiting.  This really tall, lanky black thug dude in one of those oversized white t-shirts (a thug style which started out in BALTIMORE!!!) gets his order filled, snatches it out of the employee's hands and leaves the restaurant yelling \"ANIMAL STYYYYYLE... MUTHA FUCKIN' ANIMAAAAAL STYYYYLE!\" while pounding his chest with his fist.  I knew, right then, that I had come to the right place.\n\nAfter about ten minutes or so, my order is ready.  And tasty it was!  Super good, the animal fries were really amazing, perfectly and delecately flavored and, I found out at the end, made with real, fresh potatoes.  The grilled cheese animal style was great, a toasty bun, melty cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and that thousand island-ish sauce with grilled onions, absolutely perfect.\n\nThen, this second really great thing happened.  I was siting in my cab on Jefferson there, eating my In and Out, and a radio call came in around the corner for Gary Danko Restaurant.  I jammed up Hyde street, pile of fries in my lap, and stopped in front.  As the host came out to let me know the table was paying their bill and would be out momentarily, she commented \"boy, it sure does smell good in here...\" and I was all \"hey I just got some In And Out, first time ever... You want some?\"  Her face lights up, and she's like \"oh yeah, we all love that place!\"  Soon two of the waitstaff are leaning in the side of my cab helping me scarf down the fries.  The irony here is that Danko is one of THE MOST exclusive restaurants in the city, with dinner for two costing like over $200, and here is the staff clamoring over some fries from In And Out and saying how delicious they are.  \n\nThese are the moments that make life worth living.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-01-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Everybody knows what's up with the food here (I had a double double, animal style, fries and a glass of water - it was as it always is) - but who really stops to think about the bathrooms?\n\n"], "author": "Joe C.", "review": "Everybody knows what's up with the food here (I had a double double, animal style, fries and a glass of water - it was as it always is) - but who really stops to think about the bathrooms?\n\nIn Thailand in restaurant and bar bathrooms, there are these guys who make their living a few cents at a time by giving men shoulder rubs as the men use the urinals.

In-N-Out serves your typical American-styled fast food burgers and fries with sodas, shakes, and even hot chocolate with marshmallows to supplement. \n\nI typically order:\n1. Hamburger w/ Grilled Onions\nIt's simple but amazingly delectable. The edge of the bun is toasted. When you take your first bite into the burger, you'll taste that first crunch.   As you bite into the center, you'll taste a variety of scrumptious flavors like the well-balanced layers of cold iceberg lettuce topped with  refreshing slices of tomato, the well-seasoned, juicy beef patty, and grilled onions for extra flavor. A very simple burger made with so much taste!\n\n2. Well Done French Fries (w/ Grilled Onions & Spread on the side)\nThis is like the cheaper version of animal-style fries except without the cheese and more crunch with every bite. I personally like this one more because I'd rather have the spread cold and not splattered all over the fries. One tip - order \"WELL DONE\" fries for extra crisp!\n\nIn-N-Out is great because it also has a not-so-secret menu.\n\nSome Tips & Highlights..\n1. You can order your burger extra toasted, animal-styled (grilled onions and their famous spread), with double meat, layered (3x3 or 4x4), and even protein style (no bun). You can also order fries well-done or even with cheese or grilled onions. \n2. Ask for spread to dip with your fries or even add it to your burger!\n\nIn this particular location, the service is generally really fast. There may be a long wait for your order if it's during busy hours in the day (like lunch or dinner time). Keep in mind that it is by the pier, so it's definitely a very touristy spot and generally very busy. I typically go at night (after 8pm) for free metered parking around Beach St and less crowd.\n\nI love this place so much!

Great customer service that reminded me of other fast food chains that tend to excel on this aspect, such as Chick-Fil-A and Culver's.

And unlike years ago, one can now find it on InO's website: http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx\n\nIt does make me a little disappointed that you can't order bacon for any of their burgers if you desire it, nor can you choose to order onion rings instead of fries from what I can tell. And even when I remembered to order the fries well done one time, it only improved their fries slightly. That said, the animal style sauce is absolutely awesome, and I wish M Burger(inspired by In-N-Out, from what I've read) in Chicago actually offered a sauce like InO's animal sauce! (correct me if I'm wrong about M Burger, Chicago area residents and visitors who've been to one) The neopolitan shake was also great(mix of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry shakes together), and I think it'd help InO to have a second location somewhere else within SF, to reduce the crowds at this location. Agree the dining room often looked really packed, and why I always ordered my food to go each time I visited. Though honestly I admire the fact that the service was never too bad on any of my visits here, and they do seem to maintain decent service at this one, despite the big crowds it gets for being the only one within SF.\n\nIf I ever get to another InO(which I suspect one day I will), I'd like to see how their grilled cheese sandwich is like. In the end though(note I've never had a Shake Shack burger, and am only comparing it against other chains in this sentence), my verdict is that I liked the burger here more than Five Guys, but that I prefer Culver's for their burgers, and that both Culver's and Five Guys have better fries(looking at that aspect alone, sans animal style sauce).

At Five Guys the burger still manages to taste juicy despite the fact that you have no other option than medium-well (they say it's well-done but it's almost always medium-well). \n\nToppings/Condiments- No comparison here really, Five Guys wins out by a huge margin as far as customization within these two categories.

Of course, when you're feeling like this, it's a fantastic time for the perfected simplicity of In-N-Out. Nothing better than adding to feeling cranky, run down and chunky then eating a burger and fries! Seriously, my tastebuds alert my endorphines, who kick in and beat the concept of calories out of my head.\n\nYes, we in CA are spoiled by many many exclusives and In-N-Out, I'm sure is in the top hundred list of the majority of Californians.

Hamburgers, cheeseburgers and the infamous Double Doubles (double meat, double cheese). They come with lettuce, tomatoes, thousand Island and onions. You can request grilled onions and pickles at no extra cost but of course, if you are \"In-N-Out virgin\" (heh heh-sorry love a good double entendre) the way to go is to go \"Animal Style\". I'm not even gonna go into what animal style entails but trust me, your friends at home will be impressed when you told them. If you like your burgers with no fuss but are still curious to try animal style you can get your fries that way instead. Feel a little better about the reckless abandonment of your waistline by knowing your food was cooked in vegetable oil.    \n\nThis location has its pros and cons. There is no drive through and its in Fisherman's Wharf area next to Hooters. It is as busy as pretty much any other In-N-Out but instead of an assortment of locals, there is a healthy representation of tourists and homeless. Still it's also one of the only places in the wharf area where you can lunch for around $5 and the quality is par with many other In-N-Out across the state.
