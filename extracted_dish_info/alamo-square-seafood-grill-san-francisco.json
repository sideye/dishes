I love to take friends or family visiting from out of town as it is lively but intimate, celebrate special occasions or simply catch up with friends over a well-prepared French specialty paired with an equally appropriate and reasonably priced wine selection.  \n\nThe service is exceptional!  Ken (the only server) is attentive, animated but very professional, and quick while precise.  If you've been there at least a few times, he'll address you by name, remember what you ordered and even where you sat the previous time.  He pretty much runs the show and does it with style and grace, which filters through the rest of the staff and the guests. \n\nI highly recommend ASSG (at the risk of ruining the cozy feel that characterizes it), especially on \" 1/2 off wine Mondays\", and \"BYOW-no-corkage fee Wednesdays\".

She also explained that there were parties who'd been sitting and talking for 20+ mins. after eating and paying, to which I suggested she kindly tell them that a party with a reservation is waiting to be seated (she refused). Then I reiterated that we had a 9 PM reservation because we were in a hurry and had an event at 10 PM, to which she said, \"Then maybe you should've made a reservation for 8:30 PM.\" (So, needless to say, she was terribly rude). I wanted to leave and find another place to eat, but doing so after 9 PM in San Francisco when you have a show coming up is practically impossible.\n\nMy friend and I finally got seated after 9 PM (they took my suggestion of separating the two free small tables, but not before denying us that table). We ordered the grilled rib eye, medium rare. Worst steak I've ever had. I've never had a steak with so much fat on it, and the pommes frites were soaked in oil. I should've stuck to my gut - any steak in this city below $20 is probably a bad steak. In addition, every time the waitress needed to get past my friend, she would use her hip to push past his elbow several times, without even saying \"excuse me.\"\n\nGiven how bad the food was, and how rude the waitress was, I left no tip (my friend left a decent tip - he arrived right after the argument with the waitress). We were on our way to our show when the waitress used my number from my reservation to call and complain that I left no tip and tried to explain that they did their best to accommodate my friend and me. When I attempted to speak on the phone, she interrupted me and talked over me during the entire call. The fact that she even called my number crossed the line, because it's obvious that she wouldn't have called me if I had left a tip.
