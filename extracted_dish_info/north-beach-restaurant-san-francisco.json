They also charged us for two Caprese salads not 3 as delivered...that was wrong...we should only have paid for one since that is what I ordered...one for me!  They also did not come to our table very often and we had to wave each time to find someone to help us.  They had 4-5 waiters on all the tables outside and our waiter, when we did get his attention, kept making it a point to tell us 'how busy he was and they were'.  WHAT?  He again was rude but thought he was funny..NOT! I had to bite my tongue and get through our overpriced lunch so we could leave.  This event happens every year...either you need more staffing during the parade or you limit the customer seating, so your staff you do have, can do their job and BE POLITE!  I will not be eating at this restaurant again and will make sure I do not recommend it to my friends or family.  Next year I'll make sure to get a table at a different restaurant and hopefully they will know how to treat a paying customer no matter their status.  NB Restaurant staff was definitely running around and catering to their longtime wealthy customers and kept us waiting! I tried to get my husband to leave only a 10% tip for the service..but I am sure he didn't do that.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT unless you care to be treated like poor trash!

I guess it's not fair to compare as Basta Pasta no longer exists, but I couldn't help it.  although I'm nursing a cold, the food was good, tasted almost the same. But the atmosphere is so different.
