Haight Ashbury. Make Love, Not War. None of this has to do with this restaurant, but I just wanted an excuse to go ask Alice, man. This probably ain't that Alice, but I'm thinking Alice has something to do with Eric who operates a nearly identical-looking Chinese restaurant a few blocks north on Church in Noe Valley. Sister? Ex-wife maybe? If so, she didn't do well in the divorce settlement because her location is on the decidedly more residential Sanchez Street. Both are housed in refurbished Victorians though Alice's configuration felt more crowded for some reason.\n\nThe other difference, I have to admit, is that the staff is not as friendly at Alice's as emphasis was placed on speed over substance. I must have come at an opportune time since they gave me a table for four, a decision they likely regretted since a stream of diners in packs came in after me. I would have moved, but they already set out the tea and water for me. OK, I'll eat quick then. I first ordered the $5.50 appetizer of Garlic Eggplant, which they sliced into halves and covered in a sweet hoisin sauce with sesame seeds (photo: http://bit.ly/1UGknkt).

I was hoping for a crispier duck with minimal sauce, but instead it tasted more like a sweet-&-sour version heavy on the sauce with the duck hidden in a pile of cut vegetables (photo: http://bit.ly/1L5SNav). The duck was good quality and the skin well rendered, but the wok-fried preparation really wasn't what I was in the mood for. But I better finish because there are people waiting at the front door.
