"], "author": "Victoria E.", "review": "Have passed by here en route to somewhere, often to Richmond or Sunset after City Arts or Mission outing. Decided - I have to eat here sometime. I learned to appreciate Lebanese food when I worked in U.K. I had gotten so obsessed about it that summer, that I ended up riding tube EVERYWHERE in London in search of the best of the best Lebanese food. I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me). There is zero Alsatian restaurant here either, which is just about my favorite type of food on earth (combining German and French food, sort of my version of heaven!) But I digress. \n\nMazzat is a Lebanese restaurant. It has extremely wonderful selection of mazzat, which is basically tapas. My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date. This was no exception. \n\nFood aside, this is a great restaurant for catching up. N8 and I had a lot to catch up. Last month has been a whirlwind for me and him. I felt that I'd gone into the tunnel and out on the other end, and now I'm an entirely new person with absolutely zero short term memory. I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine. One pot was too big for one person, best to be shared with your friend. \n\nThis was an intensely amazing meal with things you'd not often get in San Francisco. By the end of the meal we were all caught up. We synched our calendars to schedule in our next outing, while waited for check to arrive.

The fried breaded part of the eggplants was complemented nicely by the yogurt sauce, and the jasmine rice, although a bit bland, was a good offset to our cold platters. As for the cold dishes, I thought the tabouli and Mazzat salad were slightly too lemony for my taste, but the hummus harr we had on pita bread had a full-bodied flavor.\n\nThe service was cordial and helpful.

The halloumi cheese, or \"grilled cheese\", was squeaky white cheese and included 3 pieces of it; that was pretty good. Hummus was okay; I've had better. I liked the yogurt sauce the most; it was light and minty. Also, their pita bread came out warm and fresh. For the \"hot\" dishes, we ordered falafel, tangy eggplant, and ouzi. Falafel dish came with 2 pieces, which were not even hot; actually, they weren't even warm, which bothered me. Isn't falafel supposed to be deep-fried?? The tangy eggplant was WAY too tangy.

At $20/person, the Mazzat platter is on the upper end of the price range for a standard dinner but is a great way to sample all their creations. (Also, it abides by the rule of thumb that you can't go wrong ordering what the restaurant is named after.)\n\nThe spoils:\n\n3 cold mazzat:\n(++) Hummus harr (chickpeas mixed with garlic, lemon juice, chili paste, tahini, topped with fried pine-nuts): Pretty good hummus, made even better with the toppings.

The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft.

Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time.

For two people, it was a lot of food, and we had plenty leftovers to take home....we also got extra pita because we ran out of bread before running out of anything else, so I guess it was a decent price at $20 per person. \n\nHot Dishes:\n1. Hummus with Beef: The hummus was pretty good, and I liked that there were full chickpeas and pine nuts in it, although now I kind of wish we had gotten the Hummus Harr instead. I found it to be pretty standard, nice hummus.\n2. Fatet Batinjan: This was surprisingly my favorite hot dish by far, especially considering I am usually a very carnivorous diner.... The croutons were sooo good, and the crunch contrasted well with how soft the eggplants were. It was seasoned nicely and really hit the spot for that burst of unique flavor that I was craving.\n3. Ouzi: This was okay. It wasn't that much rice, and I think it was pretty soft and flavorful, but it wasn't mind-blowing. I usually don't like lamb because I find it gamey, but there wasn't anything about this dish that bothered me either, so I guess that was a plus!\n\nCold Dishes:\n1. Tabouli: Um....I don't remember this one super well.....so I'm assuming it was neither amazing nor distasteful, but there was a lot going on that platter, and my focus was definitely directed at the Fatet Batinjan and the Shankaleesh, really...\n2. Mutabal: I think this was pretty good. It was a unique, fruity-sweet flavor and added a nice contrast to the mostly savory dishes we had on our platter. \n3. Shankaleesh: I was surprised that this was my favorite cold dish! It was pretty salty, but sooo, soo good. I think this one was one I might crave in the future. I just liked how all the flavors matched so well together, and it balanced nicely with the pita.\n\nThe pita, by the way, was awesome.

I learned to appreciate Lebanese food when I worked in U.K. I had gotten so obsessed about it that summer, that I ended up riding tube EVERYWHERE in London in search of the best of the best Lebanese food. I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me). There is zero Alsatian restaurant here either, which is just about my favorite type of food on earth (combining German and French food, sort of my version of heaven!)

My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date. This was no exception. \n\nFood aside, this is a great restaurant for catching up. N8 and I had a lot to catch up. Last month has been a whirlwind for me and him. I felt that I'd gone into the tunnel and out on the other end, and now I'm an entirely new person with absolutely zero short term memory. I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine.

The hummus was the smoothest I had ever tasted (sorry Trader Joes) and also so flavorful--not bland, but very rich, slightly spicy and perfectly seasoned. Think I hate about 10 pieces of bread through the night to finish the hummus. \n3. Zataar Pita- total letdown. Basically a open faced pita with tomatoes and olive oil. Might have been more to the ingredients, but tasted like just that. Wish we had gotten something more flavorful instead. We had to douse this dish with hummus and ask for hot sauce to even finish it. \n\nAdorable ambiance. Cute, intimate and a nice place to have dinner. Food is only so-so overall though but I would say come for appetizers, a glass of wine, and a nice ambiance. \n\nOther tips:\n+Only wine/beer here.

"], "author": "Theresa P.", "review": "Last Saturday evening, my brother and I found ourselves wandering in Hayes Valley, looking for a place to eat dinner and catch up. After being quoted long wait times at the neighborhood's trendier venues, we stumbled upon Mazzat, a new Lebanese restaurant and wine bar on the corner of Laguna and Fell. We were enticed by the offerings listed on the menu in the window, and were sold when a group sitting at a table inside made eye contact with us, pointed to their plates, and gave us the thumbs up.\n\nUpon entering, we were kindly greeted by Manuel, both the host and our waiter. The restaurant was clean and modern inside, yet cozy with dark, wood-top tables, dim lighting, and candles - great ambience for a date or a nice dinner with a small group of friends. It was also quiet enough that my brother and I could talk over the extensive and delicious options on the menu, plotting our gastronomic plan of action.\n\nYou see, Mazza are the Arab equivalent of Tapas, so my brother and I decided to forego the more traditional dinner options (which included Lebanese rice dishes, wraps, and pizzas), and opted for the Mazzat Meal Platter ($18 per person). With this we could choose three hot and three cold mazzat dishes, which would be served family-style with warm pita bread. We were happy to find many vegetarian options (neither of us eat meat), though with twenty-nine mazzat dishes to choose from, there were plenty for the carnivorous crowd, too. We finally thought we had decided on our six dishes, but just to be sure, we asked Manuel what he thought of our selection. He suggested we try a few mazza we had initially written off as not quite our style, but my brother and I decided to trust his expert opinion -- especially when he said that he'd bring us our original selections if we were unsatisfied with his recommendations.\n\nBut not a bite went back once the plates came out. Elegantly served on a family-style platter, all the dishes were full of flavor, a reflection of both the freshness of the ingredients and the delicate balance of spices, herbs, and mints used in their preparation. My brother and I both agreed that the best of the six was the one we were most wary of, the Fatet Batinjan. Manuel recommended this dish of fried eggplant topped with garlic yogurt sauce, pita croutons, and pine nuts. Definitely not your standard hummus or tabouli, this dish was the highlight of our dinner. I also enjoyed the Mujadara, a lentil rice dish topped with grilled onion and served with a side of cucumber yogurt sauce. I'm usually not a fan of cucumber yogurt sauce, but the cucumbers were so fresh and the yogurt so light that I used my last piece of pita bread to clean the inside of the cup. In fact, there wasn't a crumb left on the entire platter when my brother and I were finished with our meal. Alex, the owner, came to clear the plates and told us that nothing made him happier than to see a platter as clean as ours. Such personal service made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nI washed my meal down with a glass of cabernet ($7), while my brother had a pint of the Ommegang brew they had on tap ($8). And finally, although we were stuffed from the generously portioned feast, we couldn't say no to dessert since dinner had been so delicious. My brother got the Namoura ($3), a Lebanese pastry made with semolina, soaked in sugar syrup, and sprinkled with pistachios (although the menu said almonds). I had two delicious forkfuls, and would recommend it as one of the best Middle Eastern desserts I've had. \n\nAll in all, Mazzat is a classy and delicious spot for dinner, especially for a special date night. Alternatively, it'd make a great stop for just a small plate and a glass of wine before a night out. Given the high quality food, the impeccable service, and the trendy area of town, the prices are fair (though not cheap for those of us on a student budget).", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-02-19"}, {"excerpts": ["my favorite was the fatet batinjan", "( fried eggplant with pita croutons and garlic yogurt sauce).

Butchering through your order order because you don't know how to pronounce the names of dishes.\n\nMazzat has a good selection of interesting Lebanese/Mediterranean food--beyond the usual hummus-kebab-wrap into the realm of multi-dimensional spices and herbs.\n\nAfter scrutinizing the menu and thinking through several family style ways to order, we concluded the most cost-effective option was the Mazzat platter, which gives you a choice of 3 hot and 3 cold mazzat (appetizers). At $20/person, the Mazzat platter is on the upper end of the price range for a standard dinner but is a great way to sample all their creations. (Also, it abides by the rule of thumb that you can't go wrong ordering what the restaurant is named after.)\n\nThe spoils:\n\n3 cold mazzat:\n(++) Hummus harr (chickpeas mixed with garlic, lemon juice, chili paste, tahini, topped with fried pine-nuts): Pretty good hummus, made even better with the toppings. Has a kick from the chili but could use more spice.\n(+/-) Makdous (tangy stuffed eggplant with walnuts, red pepper, garlic and olive oil): Fascinated because I've never seen this before. The eggplants and walnuts make an interesting combination but was very very salty.\n(++) Warek enab (grape leaves stuffed with rice cooked with olive oil and lemon juice): Nice robust, pungent grape leaf flavor.\n\n3 hot mazzat:\n(++) Mosaka with beef (eggplants topped with homemade garlic tomato sauce): Probably the least adventures, but hearty and satisfying.\n(++) Arnabeet (fried cauliflower topped with garlic and lemon juice): Reminds me of fried bar food, but the garlic and lemon juice are a great addition.\n(++) Ouzi (jasmine rice cooked with ground lamb and beef in special spice blend, topped with pine nuts and almonds): Mmm, aromatic goodness. The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft. I recommend mixing and matching! Well... except maybe for the grape leaf wraps would not fare the best with pita. Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time. Mazzat definitely satisfied my curiosity and I would recommend it for any foodie's SF bucket list, though for my everyday, peasant-level Mediterranean food staple I think I will stick with simple shawarma wraps at local delis.

You can select three cold Mazzat of which I recommend:\n\n1) the Hummus Harr - delicious homemade hummus with a little something extra;\n2) the Labne - cheese with incredibly zesty zaater; and\n3) the Babaghanouge - roasted eggplant with tahini, garlic, and other flavors.\n\nAnd you can select three warm Mazzat, of which I recommend:\n\n1) Fatet Batinjan - my goodness, this is amazing.

Coming for dinner, we were seated right away, and the plethora of \"Mazzat\" dishes looked so appealing, that we decided to make a meal out of the Mazzat platter, a combination of 3 cold and 3 hot appetizers for $20/person. The spicy hummus harr was smooth and tasty (though a bit on the watery side), the labne (yogurt cheese) was thick and creamy, and both of these went so well with the basket of pita bread on the side. The ouzi was a delicious rice dish (with a yogurt/cucumber sauce on the side) mixed with ground beef and lamb, and it had a very distinct cinnamony flavor from the spices. I was a big fan of the Mazzat salad, a simple combination of feta, parsley, and tomatoes. The fatet batinjan (fried eggplant in yogurt sauce with pita croutons) I found rather flavorless, and the arnabeet (fried cauliflower) was unfortunately soggy and overcooked. In addition to the platter, we also ordered the za'atar pita, a delicious flatbread covered with a ton of za'atar (thyme/sesame/olive oil).

We went at around 6:30 and were seated instantly, since it seems to be a small corner restaurant. There were some people inside, but it wasn't too loud, and I liked that the ambiance was close and warm :)\n\nBased on a lot of suggestions, we got the Mazzat platter, which is a set of 3 Hot and 3 Cold dishes. For two people, it was a lot of food, and we had plenty leftovers to take home....we also got extra pita because we ran out of bread before running out of anything else, so I guess it was a decent price at $20 per person. \n\nHot Dishes:\n1. Hummus with Beef: The hummus was pretty good, and I liked that there were full chickpeas and pine nuts in it, although now I kind of wish we had gotten the Hummus Harr instead. I found it to be pretty standard, nice hummus.\n2. Fatet Batinjan: This was surprisingly my favorite hot dish by far, especially considering I am usually a very carnivorous diner.... The croutons were sooo good, and the crunch contrasted well with how soft the eggplants were. It was seasoned nicely and really hit the spot for that burst of unique flavor that I was craving.\n3. Ouzi: This was okay. It wasn't that much rice, and I think it was pretty soft and flavorful, but it wasn't mind-blowing. I usually don't like lamb because I find it gamey, but there wasn't anything about this dish that bothered me either, so I guess that was a plus!\n\nCold Dishes:\n1. Tabouli: Um....I don't remember this one super well.....so I'm assuming it was neither amazing nor distasteful, but there was a lot going on that platter, and my focus was definitely directed at the Fatet Batinjan and the Shankaleesh, really...\n2. Mutabal: I think this was pretty good. It was a unique, fruity-sweet flavor and added a nice contrast to the mostly savory dishes we had on our platter. \n3. Shankaleesh: I was surprised that this was my favorite cold dish! It was pretty salty, but sooo, soo good. I think this one was one I might crave in the future. I just liked how all the flavors matched so well together, and it balanced nicely with the pita.\n\nThe pita, by the way, was awesome.

Butchering through your order order because you don't know how to pronounce the names of dishes.\n\nMazzat has a good selection of interesting Lebanese/Mediterranean food--beyond the usual hummus-kebab-wrap into the realm of multi-dimensional spices and herbs.\n\nAfter scrutinizing the menu and thinking through several family style ways to order, we concluded the most cost-effective option was the Mazzat platter, which gives you a choice of 3 hot and 3 cold mazzat (appetizers). At $20/person, the Mazzat platter is on the upper end of the price range for a standard dinner but is a great way to sample all their creations. (Also, it abides by the rule of thumb that you can't go wrong ordering what the restaurant is named after.)\n\nThe spoils:\n\n3 cold mazzat:\n(++) Hummus harr (chickpeas mixed with garlic, lemon juice, chili paste, tahini, topped with fried pine-nuts): Pretty good hummus, made even better with the toppings. Has a kick from the chili but could use more spice.\n(+/-) Makdous (tangy stuffed eggplant with walnuts, red pepper, garlic and olive oil): Fascinated because I've never seen this before. The eggplants and walnuts make an interesting combination but was very very salty.\n(++) Warek enab (grape leaves stuffed with rice cooked with olive oil and lemon juice): Nice robust, pungent grape leaf flavor.\n\n3 hot mazzat:\n(++) Mosaka with beef (eggplants topped with homemade garlic tomato sauce): Probably the least adventures, but hearty and satisfying.\n(++) Arnabeet (fried cauliflower topped with garlic and lemon juice): Reminds me of fried bar food, but the garlic and lemon juice are a great addition.\n(++) Ouzi (jasmine rice cooked with ground lamb and beef in special spice blend, topped with pine nuts and almonds): Mmm, aromatic goodness. The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft. I recommend mixing and matching! Well... except maybe for the grape leaf wraps would not fare the best with pita. Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time. Mazzat definitely satisfied my curiosity and I would recommend it for any foodie's SF bucket list, though for my everyday, peasant-level Mediterranean food staple I think I will stick with simple shawarma wraps at local delis.

I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me).

My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date.

You can select three cold Mazzat of which I recommend:\n\n1) the Hummus Harr - delicious homemade hummus with a little something extra;\n2) the Labne - cheese with incredibly zesty zaater; and\n3) the Babaghanouge - roasted eggplant with tahini, garlic, and other flavors.\n\nAnd you can select three warm Mazzat, of which I recommend:\n\n1) Fatet Batinjan - my goodness, this is amazing. The pita croutons give this fried eggplant an extra crisp to it. If I could, I'd order three of these;\n2) Foul Madummas - fava beans with garlic and olive oil; and\n3) Halloumi Cheese - who can say no to Halloumi cheese?\n\nBut, to be fair, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The Zaatar Pita (Thyme) is also a delicious entree choice, as well as the lentil soup (made for vegans!)\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how much I love, LOVE, that Mazzat has so many options for vegetarians.

Hummus with Beef: The hummus was pretty good, and I liked that there were full chickpeas and pine nuts in it, although now I kind of wish we had gotten the Hummus Harr instead. I found it to be pretty standard, nice hummus.\n2. Fatet Batinjan: This was surprisingly my favorite hot dish by far, especially considering I am usually a very carnivorous diner.... The croutons were sooo good, and the crunch contrasted well with how soft the eggplants were. It was seasoned nicely and really hit the spot for that burst of unique flavor that I was craving.\n3. Ouzi: This was okay. It wasn't that much rice, and I think it was pretty soft and flavorful, but it wasn't mind-blowing. I usually don't like lamb because I find it gamey, but there wasn't anything about this dish that bothered me either, so I guess that was a plus!\n\nCold Dishes:\n1.

Mutabal: I think this was pretty good. It was a unique, fruity-sweet flavor and added a nice contrast to the mostly savory dishes we had on our platter. \n3. Shankaleesh: I was surprised that this was my favorite cold dish! It was pretty salty, but sooo, soo good. I think this one was one I might crave in the future.

Has a kick from the chili but could use more spice.\n(+/-) Makdous (tangy stuffed eggplant with walnuts, red pepper, garlic and olive oil): Fascinated because I've never seen this before. The eggplants and walnuts make an interesting combination but was very very salty.\n(++) Warek enab (grape leaves stuffed with rice cooked with olive oil and lemon juice): Nice robust, pungent grape leaf flavor.\n\n3 hot mazzat:\n(++) Mosaka with beef (eggplants topped with homemade garlic tomato sauce): Probably the least adventures, but hearty and satisfying.\n(++) Arnabeet (fried cauliflower topped with garlic and lemon juice): Reminds me of fried bar food, but the garlic and lemon juice are a great addition.\n(++) Ouzi (jasmine rice cooked with ground lamb and beef in special spice blend, topped with pine nuts and almonds): Mmm, aromatic goodness. The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft. I recommend mixing and matching! Well... except maybe for the grape leaf wraps would not fare the best with pita. Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time. Mazzat definitely satisfied my curiosity and I would recommend it for any foodie's SF bucket list, though for my everyday, peasant-level Mediterranean food staple I think I will stick with simple shawarma wraps at local delis.

The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft.

I learned to appreciate Lebanese food when I worked in U.K. I had gotten so obsessed about it that summer, that I ended up riding tube EVERYWHERE in London in search of the best of the best Lebanese food. I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me). There is zero Alsatian restaurant here either, which is just about my favorite type of food on earth (combining German and French food, sort of my version of heaven!) But I digress. \n\nMazzat is a Lebanese restaurant. It has extremely wonderful selection of mazzat, which is basically tapas. My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date. This was no exception. \n\nFood aside, this is a great restaurant for catching up. N8 and I had a lot to catch up. Last month has been a whirlwind for me and him. I felt that I'd gone into the tunnel and out on the other end, and now I'm an entirely new person with absolutely zero short term memory. I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine. One pot was too big for one person, best to be shared with your friend. \n\nThis was an intensely amazing meal with things you'd not often get in San Francisco. By the end of the meal we were all caught up. We synched our calendars to schedule in our next outing, while waited for check to arrive.

The halloumi cheese should be avoided at all costs.  They were basically congealed, waxy slabs of plastic and nearly inedible.  Fatet betinjan - merely okay.  And when eggplant is merely okay, I get suspicious because I love eggplant in all its varietals.  If you're somehow forced to eat here, I would go for the babaghanouge or couscous - those were both pretty decent.  But Jannah on Fulton or even Ziryab on Divis are both substantially better, and there is no way I'd waste any more precious food calories on Mazzat.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-07-13"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered several items from the \"Cold Mazzat\" menu: hummus, babaghanouge, and eggplant pomegrante.

At $20/person, the Mazzat platter is on the upper end of the price range for a standard dinner but is a great way to sample all their creations. (Also, it abides by the rule of thumb that you can't go wrong ordering what the restaurant is named after.)\n\nThe spoils:\n\n3 cold mazzat:\n(++) Hummus harr (chickpeas mixed with garlic, lemon juice, chili paste, tahini, topped with fried pine-nuts): Pretty good hummus, made even better with the toppings. Has a kick from the chili but could use more spice.\n(+/-) Makdous (tangy stuffed eggplant with walnuts, red pepper, garlic and olive oil): Fascinated because I've never seen this before. The eggplants and walnuts make an interesting combination but was very very salty.\n(++) Warek enab (grape leaves stuffed with rice cooked with olive oil and lemon juice): Nice robust, pungent grape leaf flavor.\n\n3 hot mazzat:\n(++) Mosaka with beef (eggplants topped with homemade garlic tomato sauce): Probably the least adventures, but hearty and satisfying.\n(++) Arnabeet (fried cauliflower topped with garlic and lemon juice): Reminds me of fried bar food, but the garlic and lemon juice are a great addition.\n(++) Ouzi (jasmine rice cooked with ground lamb and beef in special spice blend, topped with pine nuts and almonds): Mmm, aromatic goodness. The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft. I recommend mixing and matching! Well... except maybe for the grape leaf wraps would not fare the best with pita. Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time. Mazzat definitely satisfied my curiosity and I would recommend it for any foodie's SF bucket list, though for my everyday, peasant-level Mediterranean food staple I think I will stick with simple shawarma wraps at local delis.

Hummus with Beef: The hummus was pretty good, and I liked that there were full chickpeas and pine nuts in it, although now I kind of wish we had gotten the Hummus Harr instead. I found it to be pretty standard, nice hummus.\n2. Fatet Batinjan: This was surprisingly my favorite hot dish by far, especially considering I am usually a very carnivorous diner....

I learned to appreciate Lebanese food when I worked in U.K. I had gotten so obsessed about it that summer, that I ended up riding tube EVERYWHERE in London in search of the best of the best Lebanese food. I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me). There is zero Alsatian restaurant here either, which is just about my favorite type of food on earth (combining German and French food, sort of my version of heaven!) But I digress. \n\nMazzat is a Lebanese restaurant. It has extremely wonderful selection of mazzat, which is basically tapas. My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date. This was no exception. \n\nFood aside, this is a great restaurant for catching up. N8 and I had a lot to catch up. Last month has been a whirlwind for me and him. I felt that I'd gone into the tunnel and out on the other end, and now I'm an entirely new person with absolutely zero short term memory. I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine. One pot was too big for one person, best to be shared with your friend. \n\nThis was an intensely amazing meal with things you'd not often get in San Francisco.

My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon.

I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine.

Hummus with Beef: The hummus was pretty good, and I liked that there were full chickpeas and pine nuts in it, although now I kind of wish we had gotten the Hummus Harr instead.

The croutons were sooo good, and the crunch contrasted well with how soft the eggplants were. It was seasoned nicely and really hit the spot for that burst of unique flavor that I was craving.\n3. Ouzi: This was okay. It wasn't that much rice, and I think it was pretty soft and flavorful, but it wasn't mind-blowing.

Butchering through your order order because you don't know how to pronounce the names of dishes.\n\nMazzat has a good selection of interesting Lebanese/Mediterranean food--beyond the usual hummus-kebab-wrap into the realm of multi-dimensional spices and herbs.\n\nAfter scrutinizing the menu and thinking through several family style ways to order, we concluded the most cost-effective option was the Mazzat platter, which gives you a choice of 3 hot and 3 cold mazzat (appetizers). At $20/person, the Mazzat platter is on the upper end of the price range for a standard dinner but is a great way to sample all their creations. (Also, it abides by the rule of thumb that you can't go wrong ordering what the restaurant is named after.)\n\nThe spoils:\n\n3 cold mazzat:\n(++) Hummus harr (chickpeas mixed with garlic, lemon juice, chili paste, tahini, topped with fried pine-nuts): Pretty good hummus, made even better with the toppings. Has a kick from the chili but could use more spice.\n(+/-) Makdous (tangy stuffed eggplant with walnuts, red pepper, garlic and olive oil): Fascinated because I've never seen this before. The eggplants and walnuts make an interesting combination but was very very salty.\n(++) Warek enab (grape leaves stuffed with rice cooked with olive oil and lemon juice): Nice robust, pungent grape leaf flavor.\n\n3 hot mazzat:\n(++) Mosaka with beef (eggplants topped with homemade garlic tomato sauce): Probably the least adventures, but hearty and satisfying.\n(++) Arnabeet (fried cauliflower topped with garlic and lemon juice): Reminds me of fried bar food, but the garlic and lemon juice are a great addition.\n(++) Ouzi (jasmine rice cooked with ground lamb and beef in special spice blend, topped with pine nuts and almonds): Mmm, aromatic goodness. The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft. I recommend mixing and matching! Well... except maybe for the grape leaf wraps would not fare the best with pita. Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time. Mazzat definitely satisfied my curiosity and I would recommend it for any foodie's SF bucket list, though for my everyday, peasant-level Mediterranean food staple I think I will stick with simple shawarma wraps at local delis.

I learned to appreciate Lebanese food when I worked in U.K. I had gotten so obsessed about it that summer, that I ended up riding tube EVERYWHERE in London in search of the best of the best Lebanese food. I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me). There is zero Alsatian restaurant here either, which is just about my favorite type of food on earth (combining German and French food, sort of my version of heaven!) But I digress. \n\nMazzat is a Lebanese restaurant. It has extremely wonderful selection of mazzat, which is basically tapas. My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date. This was no exception. \n\nFood aside, this is a great restaurant for catching up. N8 and I had a lot to catch up. Last month has been a whirlwind for me and him. I felt that I'd gone into the tunnel and out on the other end, and now I'm an entirely new person with absolutely zero short term memory. I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine. One pot was too big for one person, best to be shared with your friend. \n\nThis was an intensely amazing meal with things you'd not often get in San Francisco. By the end of the meal we were all caught up. We synched our calendars to schedule in our next outing, while waited for check to arrive.

After being quoted long wait times at the neighborhood's trendier venues, we stumbled upon Mazzat, a new Lebanese restaurant and wine bar on the corner of Laguna and Fell. We were enticed by the offerings listed on the menu in the window, and were sold when a group sitting at a table inside made eye contact with us, pointed to their plates, and gave us the thumbs up.\n\nUpon entering, we were kindly greeted by Manuel, both the host and our waiter. The restaurant was clean and modern inside, yet cozy with dark, wood-top tables, dim lighting, and candles - great ambience for a date or a nice dinner with a small group of friends. It was also quiet enough that my brother and I could talk over the extensive and delicious options on the menu, plotting our gastronomic plan of action.\n\nYou see, Mazza are the Arab equivalent of Tapas, so my brother and I decided to forego the more traditional dinner options (which included Lebanese rice dishes, wraps, and pizzas), and opted for the Mazzat Meal Platter ($18 per person). With this we could choose three hot and three cold mazzat dishes, which would be served family-style with warm pita bread. We were happy to find many vegetarian options (neither of us eat meat), though with twenty-nine mazzat dishes to choose from, there were plenty for the carnivorous crowd, too. We finally thought we had decided on our six dishes, but just to be sure, we asked Manuel what he thought of our selection. He suggested we try a few mazza we had initially written off as not quite our style, but my brother and I decided to trust his expert opinion -- especially when he said that he'd bring us our original selections if we were unsatisfied with his recommendations.\n\nBut not a bite went back once the plates came out. Elegantly served on a family-style platter, all the dishes were full of flavor, a reflection of both the freshness of the ingredients and the delicate balance of spices, herbs, and mints used in their preparation. My brother and I both agreed that the best of the six was the one we were most wary of, the Fatet Batinjan. Manuel recommended this dish of fried eggplant topped with garlic yogurt sauce, pita croutons, and pine nuts. Definitely not your standard hummus or tabouli, this dish was the highlight of our dinner. I also enjoyed the Mujadara, a lentil rice dish topped with grilled onion and served with a side of cucumber yogurt sauce. I'm usually not a fan of cucumber yogurt sauce, but the cucumbers were so fresh and the yogurt so light that I used my last piece of pita bread to clean the inside of the cup. In fact, there wasn't a crumb left on the entire platter when my brother and I were finished with our meal. Alex, the owner, came to clear the plates and told us that nothing made him happier than to see a platter as clean as ours. Such personal service made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nI washed my meal down with a glass of cabernet ($7), while my brother had a pint of the Ommegang brew they had on tap ($8). And finally, although we were stuffed from the generously portioned feast, we couldn't say no to dessert since dinner had been so delicious. My brother got the Namoura ($3), a Lebanese pastry made with semolina, soaked in sugar syrup, and sprinkled with pistachios (although the menu said almonds). I had two delicious forkfuls, and would recommend it as one of the best Middle Eastern desserts I've had. \n\nAll in all, Mazzat is a classy and delicious spot for dinner, especially for a special date night. Alternatively, it'd make a great stop for just a small plate and a glass of wine before a night out.
