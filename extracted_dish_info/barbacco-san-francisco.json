Nothing necessarily bad about them but nothing that makes them different or special. The sides are pretty much drenched in oil though, which I find to be excessive and unnecessary when it comes to veggies, so if you're grease-adverse, I'd avoid them.\n\nMost of the pasta and entree dishes didn't really stand out to me either. The only thing I'd really, really recommend are the SICILIAN MEATBALLS (also recommended by 7x7 in their 2014 Big Eat List). I personally didn't enjoy the pastas that much because they're mostly very heavy and creamy, but some people like their pastas that way. Heaviness aside, I didn't find the pastas to be particularly interesting flavor-wise.\n\n4 stars for the meatballs though! And their focaccia bread is pretty good.\n\n====================\n\n*** SALADS ***\n\nTheir salads are decent and a good alternative for a lighter, healthier meal, but nothing really special. The ingredients are generally pretty fresh. \n\nIf you want meat, get:\n    -BUTCHERS SALAD (romaine, pickled peppers, ham, salami, mozzarella, croutons)\n\nIf you want fruit, get:\n    -ARUGULA SALAD (arugula, apples)\n    -KALE SALAD (kale, pomegranate)\n    -SEASONAL FRUIT SALAD (apples, bananas, grapes, berries) - Varies depending on what's in season, like pineapples or persimmons\n\nIf you want a heavier, more filling salad:\n    -KALE AND FARRO (kale, farro, tomato, cucumber, olives, red onion) - The farro will fill you up!\n\nMy personal favorite:\n    -ROASTED BEETS SALAD (arugula, beets, goat cheese) - Get if you like beets!\n\n====================\n\n*** SIDES ***\n\n-{GET} FOCACCIA BREAD - 4.5/5\n[rosemary, sea salt]\nYUM. A little heavy with the olive oil, but incredibly soft and yummy\n\n-BRUSCHETTA - 3.5/5\n[spring onion, ricotta, toasted almonds]\nThe bread was nowhere near crunchy. Also very, very oily (which is probably why the bread ended up being chewy). I let one piece sit on a napkin and when I lifted it up, the oil had seeped through. The flavors of the toppings were good though.\n\n-BUTTERNUT SQUASH - 3.5/5\nGreasy like everything else. Honestly pretty standard but it was a well cooked side. I enjoyed it the most out of all the sides.\n\n-ROASTED CAULIFLOWER - 3/5\nSometimes it's okay and then sometimes it's unnecessarily greasy\n\n-BRAISED BROCCOLI RABE - 3/5\n[garlic, chili, olive oil]\nNice chili flavor, but greasy\n\n-FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS - 2.5/5\n[duck fat, anchovy vinaigrette]\nI LOVE brussels sprouts and these aren't thaat bad. They're a little on the sour side, but unfortunately too greasy for me to enjoy fully\n\n====================\n\n*** PASTAS & ENTREES ***\n-{GET GET GET} POLPETTE / SICILIAN MEATBALLS - 4.5/5\n[raisins, pine nuts, braised chard, tomato sugo]\nOn 7x7's list of things to eat for good reason! These meatballs are HUGE and SUPER FILLING. Pretty greasy, but you can dab off some of that oil if you're like me... Meat had pretty good flavor! I liked the addition of the raisins for some sweetness and the pine nuts for some texture. The sauce is delicious and has some sort of unique spice/kick to it. Definitely recommend this! \n\n-BRAISED CHICKEN THIGHS - 3/5\n[caponata, pine nuts, basil, chicken jus]\nThe chicken was somewhat on the dry side (especially for thighs) and there was nothing really unique about it, but still okay. Incredibly greasy though.\n\n-FARROTTO - 2.5/5\n[farro \"risotto\", roasted mushrooms, spinach parmigiano reggiano]\nPretty heavy, creamy and rich, but decent flavor\n\n-ORRECCHIETTE - 3/5\n[\"little ears\", kale, house made fennel sausage]\nProbably my favorite of the pastas I've tried because of the sausage, but even the sausage wasn't particularly special\n\n-PACCHERI - 3/5\n[large pasta tubes, pancetta, cauliflower, tomato sugo, parmigiano reggiano]\nNothing special, but it didn't feel as heavy or creamy as some of the other pastas, so I personally enjoyed it a little more.

It comes room temperature, but they gladly brought an ice bucket to our table to chill it.\n\nFor dinner we ordered:\n\nPetrale Sole Special - lightly seasoned, fresh and healthy\n\n(2) lasagnas -  This was full of fresh Italian flavors, delectable and bittersweet taking the last bite.\n\nRoasted Cauliflower - Yummy, yummy...simple and tasty\n\nRoasted Sprouts - This was quite a hit with the duck fat it was cooked with.  I made sure there was no leaf left on the plate!\n\nButternut Squash - The balsamic was a nice accent to the sweetness-very soft and savory.\n\nPotato Leek was soup of the day.  It was creamy with a hint of sweet- very tasty.\n\nThe Cannelli Bean Maestra soup was similar to one that I make minus the carrots and celery.  This one was hearty with nuances of fresh flavors.  I will add carrots and celery to my soup from now on!\n\nFor dessert, we shared the butterscotch chocolate crunch which had heavy chocolate and butterscotch flavors.  It was heaven in a bowl and not too rich.   The egg nog panna cotta was my choice and totally satisfying.  I prefer desserts more on the light side.  This did not disappoint with some blueberries sprinkled on top.\n\nOf course, I have to mention the excellent service.   Our server was on point, friendly and a great attitude.

Our waiter greeted us quickly and based on his recommendations, we ordered the meatballs, lasagna, roasted cauliflower, and a set of three crostini (chicken pate, butternut squash, and roasted duck).  \n\nMeatballs - you get three huge ones.  The waiter said that they're majority ground pork, but also ground shortrib.  I couldn't really taste the short rib, but regardless, they were pretty good.  \n\nLasagna - I was a little disappointed by this dish.  Although the entire thing screamed homemade, it just didn't comport with my expectations of lasagna.  It was a little flat, not very cheesy, and green.  Granted there was some cheese off to the side that I probably should've mixed in, but I'm not sure if that could've saved it.  The whole dish was a bit of a let down.\n\nRoasted cauliflower - although this was only a side dish, it was one of my favorites.  I appreciated the sharp lemony zest, and how soft the cauliflower was.  I've long been a fan of roasted veggies, but I didn't know cauliflower could be this good!\n\nCrostini - these stood out as some of the best of the meal.  I loved the chicken pate - it was spread on pretty thick onto the bread, and the ratio was a bit more pate than bread.  The duck and roasted squash were good too, but I do remember the squash was a bit salty.  I realize pate isn't everyone's thing, but if you do fancy it (or simply want to try!) I'd order it here.\n\nService:  Like I alluded to earlier, this service is dang good!  Our waiter was very knowledgable.

After a last-minute business meeting that lasted for HOURS, I surely would have passed out if I'd taken one more step.

It was PACKED to the gills, as a private event had overtaken the entire upper level.  \n\nI almost wept.  I told the Hostess I needed to eat a dinner - a big one - and that I'd be sitting at the bar, which is first come, first served.  Somehow, my dilemma was discreetly relayed to Umberto, who welcomed me back and gave his oath: he would certainly find a place for me.  Maybe it was wishful thinking, part hallucination, or the totally appropriate reassurance that only a Born and Fed Italian Man can convey - I [choose to] recall that his hand rested on my mid-back for just a beat.\n\nHe made a second round, maybe 15 minutes later, and *whispered in my ear*  \"There ees a spot that I weel make, just fora' you, bella...

My life is complete; what more is there to experience?\n\nThat, Childrens, is how Barbacco elevates humble food to the level of La Perla lingerie.  There is nothing pretentious about their offerings, but it's gorgeous food that a passionate lover would make for you before taking you to the bedroom.

But there were a couple of odd quirks about the overall experience that lost a star.  \n\nFirst, the ipad wine & beer list. This could be awesome, but the way Barbacco is using it is just awkward.  They've essentially spent $400+ on what can be accomplished with a .15 cent pamphlet.  I'm not hating for the sake of it; I think the ipad menu could be really cool if you could place your drink order directly to the bar tender with it, or basically do anything with it besides merely browse their wines and beers...you know, like you do with a menu.  Especially since after fiddling with the ipad for about 15 minutes, the waiter asked me if I was really sure about my order, and proceeded to repeat what I just read about it. It was a very man vs. machine moment, the ipad and the waiter competing to prove their utility.  Meanwhile, all I wanted was a glass of sauvignon blanc.  The experience was really confusing.  \n\nSecond, I give the restaurant kudos for efficient space utilization.  There's long rows of booths, a bar, and then another bar for seating in front of the restaurant.  If the mini-bar in the front of the restaurant faced the street, it would be really cool to watch pedestrians.  But it faces the lobby, and it feels just like you're sitting in the lobby, which gets awkward as you watch other patrons get turned away. Not the most romantic setting.  If you're making reservations, I recommend specifically asking not to be sat at the table by the front door. \n\nI don't think I've ever used the word \"awkward\" so much in a review before, but it captures my Barbacco dining experience.

Subsequent bites included the onions in balsamic vinegar which worked perfectly to complement the pate.  A must for folks that get bored by charcuterie with only mustard and cornichons. \n\nWhipped Salt Cod Bruschette: Like a little salt cod patty with a chapeau of pillowy mashed potatoes.  I'm normally hesitant to get salt cod because it can taste so fishy, but this is apparently made in house and tastes a lot fresher (for salt cod).\n\nButternut Squash Passato  Soup: Probably the most disappointing item I tasted.  Too salty and watery.  Perhaps even too much butter.  I was hoping for a richer butternut squash experience.\n\nZuppa di Pesce: The small size is much smaller than the small butternut squash soup.  Lots of great herbs floating about this thin tomato broth.  Only appeared to be fish filet and no shellfish treats.  Really like the concept of being served with a crostini which had a very thick aioli sauce spread on... classier garlic bread!\n\nSlow Roasted Shoulder Porchetta Sandwich: Finally I can stop harping about how no one does porchetta better than the humble Roli Roti.  This was more tender and more flavorful by far!  Apparently they bring in a whole pig for all their pork dishes.  They could have been more liberal with the crunchy skin segments from their personal pig though.  The chewy roll was a good vehicle for absorbing all the juice (i.e. grease).  The grape topping was nice, but I could have been happy with just the meat!  The pickled veggies (carrots, celery, cauliflower, peppers) on the side tasted like pure white vinegar... keep them marinating a bit longer please.\n\nPolpette: It's nice to have over sized meatballs that crumble apart with a fork instead of insisting on a knife.  If you can slow braise meatballs, they must have done so!  The pine nuts were a good surprise inside the ball.  The greens (chard?) was sadly boring.  The tomato chunks had a fresh texture, but could have used more spice.  \n\nVanilla-Huckleberry Gelato: Second worst thing I tried on the menu.  Allegedly vanilla gelato with huckleberry jam.  The huckleberries were so dry I swear they were huckleraisins.  The vanilla gelato base was dense instead of smooth and creamy.\n\nLimonata: Not from the can or bottle, just another word for fresh lemonade.

"], "author": "Christine K.", "review": "Tapas, tapas, tapas. After moving back to Norcal from Socal, I've been dying to find a tapas restaurant that could replace that empty hole in my stomach that was previously filled by Bacaro LA near USC. Thankfully, my best friend, Erica J., shares my love for tapas and took me to this little gem that she kept raving about. Originally, we had a reservation at Chapeau but since we were stuffed from eating at Waterbar earlier in the day we opted for a later reservation at Barbacco so we could share a few bites of different dishes. Upon arriving to the restaurant, we were promptly seated at two seats at the bar. Keep in mind the restaurant is quite narrow but quite reminiscent of what I'm used to at Bacaro LA. Now, because the age group is slightly higher, the noise volume is a little better and more subdued than the chaotic screaming matches that seems to exist inside the few walls of Bacaro LA. From the bartenders to the waiters and coupled with the ipad drink order menus, the service here is impeccable and it helped me stay excited for every tapas dish that came through. \n\nOnto the food & drinks!\n\n1. Ginger Lemonade & Strawberry Lavender Lemonade: As much as I enjoyed the lovely pairing of the lavender notes of the puree that neutralized the harsher sweet tones of the strawberry, I think I would have to side with the Ginger Lemonade between the two. The ginger not only brings in a refreshing spicy kick but also a refreshing mint-like chill in the back of your throat after every sip. Especially with the heavier food we were eating the whole night, the Ginger Lemonade would have been a better choice.\n\n2. Mushroom & Chicken Liver Pate Bruschette: It's saying a lot when a mushroom fiend like myself could easily say that the chicken liver pate bruschette stole the show. At first I was a little worried that the abundance of chicken liver may be overwhelming but the onion marmellata provides a sweetness that cuts through the creaminess. \n\n3. Cauliflower: I wish I could say more about this dish, but as it is I'm not a big cauliflower fan and to me it was just cauliflower in a sauce.\n\n4. Polpette: These sicilian meatballs were to die for. On the menu it says it's made with raisins and pine nuts, which would seem strange but I definitely did not notice as it was masked my delightful notes of spice, acidity from the tomato sugo, and paired with the chard on the bottom. However, these meatballs are huge so we did not even come close to finishing them.\n\n5. Mushroom Risotto: This dish came in a heaping portion of mushroom deliciousness. The risotto was a little harder than I would have preferred but I've never had such a satisfying amount of mushrooms in a mushroom risotto. A MUST for mushroom fiends like me!!\n\n6. Local Squid with Crushed Potatoes: This dish was such a delight since the squid was perfectly done with the rustic olive oil crushed potatoes. There is some kind of crack in the sauce of this dish because we cleaned this plate like it just went through the dishwasher. \n\n7. Lemon Buttermilk Panna Cotta: My first words to my friend when dessert came to the table? \"I hate when panna cotta comes in a bowl or dish and not on a plate.\" Why? It usually means a few things...it's usually mindblowingly amazing and trying to get the remaining bits from the corners is a complete pain. I was correct on both points. The lemon buttermilk panna cotta with its few pieces of strawberry and brown sugar sauce is to die for and had the airiness that we needed after the otherwise heavy meal. \n\nUsually, I'm really hesitant to believe a 4-star rating of a restaurant in SF because the sheer amount of reviewers usually tips the average and causes a higher rating than usual....but I totally believe it for Barbacco!!

Let's start with the pasta! I ordered the shrimp linguine which was so good and surprisingly filling. However, I was a little disappointed in the amount and size of the shrimp though - there were only 3-4 pieces of shrimp and they were truly tiny. The white sauce was yummy - with garlic and chili to give it a little kick, but it did not overwhelm the other ingredients, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The second pasta dish was the rigatoni alla bolognese with beef and pork ragu. The pasta was infused with the sauce which made for an interesting look and a different but good tasting noodle.

The burrata cheese was way too gooey and soft for my taste. I live burrata cheese that are more \"stringy\" and chewy. It was a good dish to try but I think I'll skip it and try something else next time as a appetizer. \n\n(+) lasagna bolognese - spinach pasta / ragu bolognese/ besciamella sauce . I personally loved the lasagna. After seeing so many pictures and positive reviews about this dish, I decided to go with it. The serving seemed a bit small at first but it was actually pretty filling. Perfect sauce and the spinach lasagna was a nice touch. It wasn't too heavy as a I expected. \n\n(+) orecchiette - \"little ears\" / cavolo nero/ fennel sausage / pecorino cheese. I actually really enjoyed this dish too. I only tried a little of it from my friend but I'll definitely be getting this one if I come back here. I loved the fennel sausage on top. It was salty and added a nice flavor to the overall creamy dish. \n\n(-) rigatoni alla carbonara -pasta tubes/ guanciale pecorino romano / egg / black pepper. I'm usually not that picky of a eater when it comes to pasta but I didn't enjoy this dish at all. The pasta tubes itself had a rubbery/plastic taste to it. I couldn't get myself to eat more than 2-3 tubes. Meh. Do not recommend. \n\n(+/) chocolate nemesis cake - strawberries/ fudge/ toffee crumble/ vanilla crema. I seriously don't know how I would able to finish this dessert plate by myself. We shared this between 4 people and we were so full! The chocolate cake tastes like the inside of a truffle. Super rich and creamy but it is also really heavy. I love the toffee crumble on top. The vanilla crema is also really light to balance out how heavy the chocolate is. \n\nOverall, pretty decent experience.

The secret to eating great Italian food in San Francisco is making sure you dine with a true Italian who knows the food of her roots. I was already a fan of Barbacco from my previous visit, but I really enjoyed the food this time thanks to my Italiano friend Linda who joined me for lunch there over the holidays. Since Barbacco is still very communal in approach given its rural Ligurian inspiration, we were seated in the busy counter area in the middle and had three dishes - all stellar and probably none I would have ordered on my own due to my own ignorance.\n\nWe started with the $10 Local Squid with 'nduja. Yeah, I didn't know what 'nduja was either until Linda explained that it's a special smoked pork salami from Calabria, the boot tip of Italy that looks like it's kicking Sicily. The salami is spicy with red peppers minced with shoulder and belly parts, sorta like an Italian version of an Andouille, and it's stuffed into the calamari pieces, then sauteed in bread crumbs (grattato) and accompanied by rucola greens (see photo). Delicioso! This was followed by a smashing pasta called Paccheri.\n\nYeah, I've never heard of paccheri either but it immediately became one of my favorites because it's the large, tube-shaped pasta that's much bigger than rigatoni and prepared al dente.

The broccoli rabe and garlic provides just the right textural contrast to the meltiness of the chicken and polenta. We were three for three and most pleased with ourselves.

It's Italian style tapas and definitely meant to be shared family style. Let me discuss my favorite dishes.\n\nI do like the arancinis and how can you really go wrong with fried risotto croquettes filled with a little bit of short ribs and cheese. At $3/croquette, I don't always order them, but would recommend it if it's your first visit there.\n\nDefinitely try the bruschette! They have seasonal varieties and I like the classic tomato version (not always in season) and the duck liver pate with caramelized balsamic onions on top. The different combinations of bruschette are unique and go well together. Not really a big fan of the lardo (didn't really think it had a ton of taste).\n\nThey were out of the lasagna so we ordered the paccheri pasta with pork ragu. The pasta is big tube pastas (imagine giant rigatoni, not as big as manicotti). At first, I was thrown off by how the pasta was thicker and so the texture was not what I was expecting. The sauce won me over though and we didn't have problems polishing off that dish.\n\nThe flat iron steak is a winner. I think that might be my go-to \"need to order this every time I come here\" dish. It was cooked perfectly (they ask you how you like your meat cooked) and sliced into strips with you. It's seasoned so well with salt but not too salty. The mushrooms and little pearl onions are delicious too.\n\nThe quick braised squid is also cooked very well. It's not tough or rubbery and comes in a casserole dish with a yummy tomato sauce. I'm also a fan of the fried brussel sprouts. Trust me, you've never had brussel sprouts like this before. They don't have a normal brussel sprouts taste, but you can taste the vinegar.\n\nThe only thing I have ordered here and not liked is the mushroom risotto. Funny how the fried risotto croquettes are so delicious but pass on the entree. It lacked flavor and just wasn't very good... the mushrooms were good but not the actual risotto.\n\nService is excellent and the wine selection is vast (plus it's on iPads). The seating is either at the bar counter or on tandem tables (also high seats). Not the most comfortable seating but it's a fun, lively atmosphere!", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-09"}, {"excerpts": ["It had huge pasta rolls, like rigatoni without the ridges, Tender shredded pieces of pork in a simple tomato sauce and parm cheese. \n\n"], "author": "Rachel N.", "review": "Parking is hard to find there, but you can always pay for it when you park at the Embarcadero building.

Nicely seasoned and tender. Not dry at all). \n\nI had the orichette pasta with fennel sausage. It was okay, but needed a sprinkling of salt, which luckily they had at the table. \n\nI loved my dad's pork ragu. It had huge pasta rolls, like rigatoni without the ridges, Tender shredded pieces of pork in a simple tomato sauce and parm cheese. \n\nMy mom's braised chicken thighs were great as well.

I was surprised at how difficult it is to book a table on a weeknight.  We ended up with no choice but a 5 o'clock reservation. \n\nBeware: because the dinner reservation is so early and Barbacco shares the same valet as Perbacco, the valet may not even be there at 5.  My friend was frantically getting confused not knowing where to park when the valet guy was just showing up for work and hadn't had a chance to bring out his podium yet.  \n\nThe place is nice. Modern and sleek.  Most of the tables have semi-high chairs and seat six people.  So if you are a party of four, you are sitting with two random strangers.  I find this to be very prevalent in SF's new restaurants now.  Is it a way to save space?  perhaps. \n\nThe menu has a bunch of choices, all meant to be shared.  For starters, we had the croquettes and the bruschettes.  The croquettes with risotto were good, but not mind blowing like France's chickpea fritters.  Perhaps unfair to compare, but that's what came to mind when I was thinking about something starchy and fried.  \n\nAs for the bruschettes, I had the cannellini bean one.  The extra raw onions on top really ruined the subtle taste of the beans.  Again, maybe unfair to compare, but in my mind I was ready to drool over something that resembles the fava bean bruschettes from Beretta, and when it comes out less delicious, I get disappointed.  \n\nMy friends who had the duck liver bruschettes couldn't stop raving about them.  In fact, they liked it so much that when it came time to order desserts, they order a duck liver bruschette.  The other bruschettes they tried, asparagus, and sardines, were decent but didn't get much comment like the duck liver one. \n\nFor entree, I got the rigatoni pasta with ricotta cheese and asparagus and meyer lemon and mint.  Yes, the ingredients sound, unusual.  But they work extremely well together.  Texture of the pasta is perfect, the ricotta cheese is so light and blends so well with the other subtle flavors of lemon and mint.  Very good dish.  Pretty much what bumped this place to a four star from a three star restaurant. \n\nTwo friends had the steak, which were too salty according to them.  And unlike pasta which comes in a what I considered as entree size portion, the steaks didn't come with sides.  so if you are the kind that expects the meat entree to be surrounded by some sort of starch or veggies, then order something extra. \n\nOne friend ordered the rotolo pasta and it was alright. \n\nFor dessert we had the Cowgirl creamery red hawk cheese (a tiny piece) and the special, the cookie-n-cream cup of ice cream.  Ice cream was delicious, and only $2!\n\nFor some reason, our tab still added up to about $150 for four people.  The low prices of the dishes do add up when you order a bunch (plus wine).\n\nOverall, I can think of other places I recently visited that stood out more than Barbacco, but it does have its highlights and it's quite good for a post-work get together in downtown.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-03-15"}, {"excerpts": ["After providing a simple plate of rigatoni for the child, he brought multiple courses of Pasta, Salumi, Bruschetta, rollatini, exceedingly fresh mozzarella and sweet cheese...and a meat spread that was phenomenal\n\n  "], "author": "Dan W.", "review": "Nice, contemporary vibe but totally welcoming 3 adults, 1 child and a 7 week old infant.

Some of the best I've ever had. \n\nEverything else ranged from average to good, but they can't compare with the pate and chitarra. I have to mention that their chicken (Pollo al Mattone) was cooked very well - moist and tender. But it lacked flavor.

I liked the glossy wood tables, but did not like the tile floors as much. I do understand that wood floors and wood tables would like a little funny together. \n\nLet me first start by saying that prices are very good considering that the restaurant is in a prime location in the financial district. Like every Italian meal, we were some Acme bread with butter and olive oil+vinegar. The Acme bread itself tasted good, but I wish it was warm, because the butter was incredibly difficult to spread as a result. As an appetizer my family ordered three brushettes. The three included, the tuscan chicken liver pate, mango and prosciutto, and the wild mushrooms. Of the three the tuscan chicken liver pate was miles away in taste and it was very smooth as well. The mushroom bruschette was unfortunately very eccentric because it tasted rather vinegary for some odd reason. The mango and prosciutto was all wrong because the mango overpowered the prosciutto so I didn't get the saltiness for balance. Next up came our entrees. My mother ordered chitarra, I ordered the farroto, and my brother ordered the orecchiette. First off I will say that the pasta themselves were excellent, each being a little chewy which I love in my pasta. To start the chitarra was somewhat pedestrian, as the sauce seemed a little bland and might have come out of a can. The meatball/sausage it came with however was very tasty. The farroto was extremely dissapointing because the mushrooms taste did not come through at all and the risotto itself was fairly bland. Salt and pepper next time please?

The brussel sprouts were definitely the highlight of the meal without a doubt. I could eat these little green, bashed on vegetables all night long. The leaves were nice and crispy and I am sure anything fried in duck fat is amazing.

So it probably wouldn't be the best place to go if you're looking for a lot of privacy.\n\nNow for the food - I love everything I've tried from their \"Pasta etc.\" section. In particular, the farrotto (essentially risotto with mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan) was so delicious I'm developing a huge craving just thinking about it right now. The mushrooms and spinach were extremely fresh and the risotto had just the right amount of richness. If you're looking for something less cheese-heavy and light, I would also highly recommend the orecchiette. I've never had kale pesto before and Barbacco nailed it with this one. \n\nThe only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is because service wasn't as attentive as I would have liked. It gets busy around lunchtime, and it can get difficult getting a waiter's attention and they seem to be in a hurry to rush people out. Regardless, I love their menu selection and will be back many times in the future :)", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-23"}, {"excerpts": ["I got Duck Cotechino Sausage, Orecchiette or \"little ears\" in Cavolo Nero w/ Fennel Sausage & Pecorino Cheese, Roasted Squash.

Fortunately, her services are very much in demand, so she quit. To celebrate her self-proclaimed emancipation, we had dinner at Barbacco.\n\nBarbacco is a well appointed, modern, trendy & hip take on traditional, casual Italian dining. We had reservations which did insure we would have seating, but not at our own table as the seating is either at 1 of a row of long communal tables or along the bar. Service was mostly attentive, considering it was very busy. Our server was deadpan, but the rest of the staff was warm with lots of smiles.\n\nWhile the food menu was on long, narrow paper stock, the beverages were listed on iPads located on each table & on the bar. Like many things Apple, this approach was entertainingly novel but didn't provide any true functional enhancement. The food selection is very faithful to authentic Italian, meaning if you don't read or otherwise know Italian you may not know what a dish is. Lucky for me, the girlfriend lived in Italy a while & more or less translated the menu.\n\nInstead of offering composed meals, everything is a la carte. The girlfriend & I picked out our own combinations of starter/ entree/ side. She got Spicy Braised Tripe, Paccheri w/ Rustic Pork Ragu & Parmigiano Reggiano, Fried Brussels Sprouts. I got Duck Cotechino Sausage, Orecchiette or \"little ears\" in Cavolo Nero w/ Fennel Sausage & Pecorino Cheese, Roasted Squash. The food took a while, so we had a couple beers & chomped on bread (which was good) while waiting.\n\nWhen the dishes started coming out, I was reminded of the oxymoron \"jumbo shrimp.\" All 6 of our dishes were like giant tapas. Trying all 6, all were well-made & delicious but 3 of the dishes had bigger, bolder flavors than the other 3. The Spicy Braised Tripe, Orecchiette & Fried Brussels Sprouts were sensational with huge flavor. The flavors of these 3 dishes also complemented each other extremely well, making this a fantastic trio to order together. The Duck Cotechino Sausage, Paccheri & Roasted Squash were still nice, but paled in comparison. Though less intensely flavorful, these 3 dishes also complemented each other well & would be a good trio.\n\nAfter polishing off so many big little plates of food, we still found room for a piece of Chocolate Nemesis Cake. OK, it's true. The name alone was a significant factor in my wanting this dessert. Though it had an abundance of deep, rich chocolate & a substantial cookie-like crust, this chocolate cake wasn't overly intimidating in any particular way. So, despite the name, the Chocolate Nemesis Cake was easily vanquished. Scrumptiously & gratifyingly, but easily.\n\nBarbacco is an interesting & somewhat quirky new take on Italian dining. Some things are a real big hit. Some things come closer to a miss. Either way, Barbacco is far from boring. What really makes Barbacco worth trying (& trying again) is that even some of the things that are more of a miss are still pretty good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-21"}, {"excerpts": ["The prizes for favorite entrees go to the maccheroni, orecchiette, summer bean stew, and braised chicken. \n\n"], "author": "Michele P.", "review": "Barbacco is my (yes, I am going to commit to this) FAVORITE restaurant in the SF.

Not just because it's a block from work, but I love everything else about this place too.  Everything except the tight seating arrangements, if you are a party of 4 or less, and you don't want to sit at the counter, and its during lunch hour, you are more than likely going to have to share an already small table with another party. I wouldn't recommend this place for large parties either. Party of 6 max. \n\nOn the bright side... The ambiance is great! It's hip enough for a casual meal, a work lunch, and even a casual date. I wouldn't call it romantic. If you want romantic or a white table cloth setting, go next door to their sister restaurant Perbacco. \n\nTheir menu is pretty delicious. Granted I always get the same thing, I've tried many other dishes ordered by others. I'll only mention the ones I really like and dislike to make this review shorter. \n\nTheir bruschette - the only one I didn't really like was the anchovy one. All the rest are pretty darn good. My all time favorite that I always order is the chicken liver pate, served with some sauce and grilled onions on top. Yum!\n\nTheir salads - I've tried the the tuna salad. I did NOT like it. Something extremely acidic about it that just didn't sit right with me.\n\nTheir pastas - I've had the lasagna, the orecchiette, and the pork ragu. All good but the Pork Ragu, my all time favorite. Get it every time. \n\nFinally, saved the best for last, the Brussels Sprouts. This place turned me onto Brussels Sprouts. I used to never touch them, now I crave them. I've even tried many times to duplicate the recipe at home, which I've come close, but not close enough to satisfy my craving.\n\nThey have a pretty substantial wine menu as well. They did away with the iPad wine menu at every table. Maybe too many were getting stolen/broken?\n\nAll in all, I could probably safely say I go to Barbacco once every month or so. Service is fast, they've definitely mastered the serve-the-full-meal-in-under-a-hour thing.\n\nLast thought.

I asked to use the restroom. When I got back and was lingering by the door, evidently giving off crazy person vibes, the hostess kind of barked at me, \"HELLO!

Also not representative of the service, which was overall very nice.\n\nOther party arrived; we were seated at the bar. The bartender was insanely polite and attentive.

While not a completely rock solid four stars, Barbacco has proven itself to be, at the very least, a sometimes wavering, but mostly a legit four star contemporary Italian establishment. Good for a comfortable first date in the city, a catch-up with a friend, or just an after work bite.\n\nThe restaurant encompasses a modern/trendy feel with a somewhat communal atmosphere, what with the long tables, a long bar set-up with seats, and the majority of their plates being conducive to a shared, family-style experience. \n\nRecommended:\n- Fried brussel sprouts: A MUST! An addicting plate of crispy, deliciously sweet and savory red wine vinaigrette doused brussel sprouts. Perfect for sharing. \n- Bruschetta: They had a decent variety. Truffled lardo (shaved fat, basically . . . mm, fat, delicious), duck liver pate, pear and gorgonzola are all especially delicious.\n- Mushroom risotto: half shelled, which I don't come across very often, but is flavored perfectly and tastes earthier than your usual risotto because of the chewy shells \n- Lasagna: cheesy, meaty, layered with house made spinach pasta. Delicious and recommended for lasagna fans.\n- Orecchiette: \"little ears\" that come with fennel sausage, a hearty portion of sauteed kale mixed into it and delicious Italian cheeses. One of my favorites, when made right (which unfortunately it hasn't been sometimes)\n- Gelato: Butterscotch crunch - tasty and not overwhelmingly sweet at all\n- Espresso panna cotta: Both dense and surprisingly light. Delicious.  \n\nA notable quirk they possess here are the iPad drink menus at every table. Only . . .  they're SO incredibly inefficient and unnecessary. They fail more than they display the drink options, and they don't even allow you to order from them. (Maybe expand it's purpose, Barbacco? Have pictures of the specials, food, desserts, etc).  Also, the paper menu is incredibly unorganized. They clear up what certain Italian food categories (piccoline: small starter snacks, dal grano: pasta based dishes, etc) mean on the BACK . . . why?! I'm sure the wait staff has experienced the result of this poor printing choice more than enough by having to explain what could easily have been figured out on our own if it weren't for the poor menu organization. \n\nAnyway, aside from those few minor gripes, the food has been mostly consistently delicious, innovative, and while not every item on the menu hits it out of the park, nothing I've tried has ever not hit at least slightly above average. Combine that factor with the super reasonable prices, and I'm yours. \n\nMy newest reliable go-to joint in the FiDi, hands down. :)", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The orecchiette with fennel sausage and the suddenly ubiquitous cavolo nero kale was even better than my more traditional sausage and broccoli rabe favorite.

That was the perfect solution, as the wines were our primary focus for the evening. The food, if good, would only heighten the experience. But it turned out that both food and wine were equal partners in the evening's successes--and excesses.\n\nWith five or so offerings in each section (salumi, cheeses, bruschette, pastas, secondi, and sides) it was hard to make a decision. Fortunately, visiting NPA wine expert Hardy offered up his recommendations and suggested wine pairings.\n\nThe sausage-stuffed deep-fried olives and the nduja partnered perfectly with our Pinot Gris, as promised. At the risk of offending the Boccalone gods, I think I preferred this version of the spreadable salami. Maybe it was the perfectly charred, olive-oil brushed crostini that accompanied it, but the spread here seemed more meatily mellow yet flavorful, with a hint of a peppery kick.\n\nThe orecchiette with fennel sausage and the suddenly ubiquitous cavolo nero kale was even better than my more traditional sausage and broccoli rabe favorite. The little pasta ears were filled with a pesto-like rendition of the kale that was very hard to stop eating. This paired well with the NPA red blend (too many varietals to remember), as did my braised chicken thighs with almonds and castelvetrano olives and my date's lamb stew. \n\nJust as Hardy had said, the saltiness of the fried Brussels sprouts with capers and anchovies was tamed by the Pinot Gris.\n\nI may have found a favorite Italian trattoria at last! Portions and food were better than at SPQR. And even though we stuffed ourselves last night (including the flourless chocolate cake to go--don't judge), I can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu. \n\nYou have to love a place that serves NPA wines and has special NPA wine nights--and that has a dessert called chocolate nemesis.

We started with the suppli, which had a nicely distinct wild mushroom flavor and were yummy but probably would've been even yummier with marinara (which is possibly non-traditional?  I have no idea.

The pastas were a highlight for me -- I got the orecchiette with sausage and my husband got the paccheri with pork ragu and they were both exceptional.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "For the longest time I had assumed that Barbacco specialized in barbacoa, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a trendy Italian restaurant with craft pasta and bar bites. \n\nIn my opinion the menu is just right, not overwhelmingly huge but not overly minimalist. It offers a sufficient variety to cater to your preferences. They even have corn-based gluten-free fusilli! Although I often scoff at the pointlessness of the gluten-free hype, corn pasta sounds like a creative and delicious idea :P\n\nWe started with BRANDACUJUN (don't ask me how to pronounce it) aka salt cod fritters. It was comparable to salt cod fish cakes at most places, consisting of meatball-shaped cod surrounded by a golden panko coating. Each of the 3 accompanying aioli tasted distinctly different, though I don't remember the descriptions the server introduced to us. At $11 for 3 fritters it's a bit pricey (and difficult to share because it crumbles when you cut it in half), but noteworthy and appetizing indeed.\n\nAt first it bothered me that the FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($6) were so inconsistent, with some pieces dry and plain while other pieces were doused to a pungent tangyness in the red wine vinaigrette. The texture was similarly heterogeneous, ranging from thin, crisp, almost flash-fried single leaflets to chunks with more resistance to the bite. I quickly came to appreciate how the dish showcases the fascinating diversity in something as simple as fried Brussels sprouts. (Just like how SF adores the variation of basic avo toasts)\n\nThe risotto was the reason we came to visit (I had been on something of a risotto quest for boo's cravings). While it was not the absolute best risotto I've ever had, it was memorable and exemplified the same culinary finesse of creating a signature dish from simple ingredients. Named the FARROTTO ($15), the \"risotto\" was farro-based for a heartier, grainier texture and a more complex, earthier flavor profile. The farro was more chewy and fell short of the intriguingly al dente firmness of traditional risotto, but the savory parmigiano reggiano, roasted mushrooms, and spinach gave a nice oomph. Overall I liked the spin and the healthier approach in contrast to the typically creamy, rich composition.\n\nI didn't know what to expect of the LUMACHE ($17; featuring green \"snail-shaped\" pasta), and it turned out to be another interesting and unique pasta creation. The lamb sugo was braised melty soft (and came in a surprisingly generous portion) blended with a bold arrabiata-like spicy tomato sauce, a garnish of cool mint leaves, and sharp pecorino cheese. The pasta was notably al dente, and the snail shape was excellent for scooping up sauce. \n\nThe dining experience at Barbacco has its share of class and stellar Italian cuisine, yet it remains casual and comfortable. (The nearby Perbacco is its fancier sibling.) True to its name, Barbacco includes a long row of bar seating (with extremely comfortable bar stools) along one side of the restaurant.\n\nThe verdict?

We waited a couple minutes and she escorted us toward the back of this narrow restaurant. As my friends and I walked to our table, I noticed an expansive and long bar area. The overall decor was fine; nothing was particularly outstanding. The choice of music throughout the night was \"interesting\" to say the least. It was a mishmash of disco, R&B, pop, and then the \"Game of Thrones\" theme song played... (My friend: \"Wait is this...?\" *listening* \"It's the 'Game of Thrones' theme song!\" Me: \"Ohhh...\" *shrugs*) \n\nAnyway, it took several minutes until our server greeted us and then it took awhile until he came back to take our order. I'm not sure if he was the only server in that section (which didn't look too busy), but he seemed to be MIA at times. On to the food: the kale salad is highly recommended. I loved the golden raisins and almonds added in for texture and bite ($8). We also ordered an antipasti plate of marinated asparagus ($5). My friends said they enjoyed that; it was fresh and bright thanks to the meyer lemon. I ordered the chitarra ($14) which was good, but some flavors didn't seem to pair well together. The pasta had meat balls, pine nuts, raisins, chard, and a spicy tomato sugo. The spiciness, for some reason, wasn't doing it for me.

She also gave us a HUGE heads up about the Chinese New Year parade that would close down a large portion of Market Street. Gotta give her props because it was a nightmare to get around that night. Our server (forgot her name) was awesome. Very personable, not stiff and gave us the full rundown of the menu and specials.

The creamy pate combined with the sweetness of the grilled onions was amazing. If you're in the mood for pasta while at Barbacco, go with the Chitarra. The pasta and sauce are excellent but the  star of the dish were the meatballs. Some of the best I've ever had. \n\nEverything else ranged from average to good, but they can't compare with the pate and chitarra. I have to mention that their chicken (Pollo al Mattone) was cooked very well - moist and tender. But it lacked flavor. I think that dish can absolutely be elevated a little more with the right flavors/seasoning. \n\nI would also stay clear of the Tagliata and Orecchiette. Both sound amazing but had no wow factor. In fact, the Orecchiette was a big disappointment. Instead, we should have went with the Farrotto or even the Lasagna Bolognese.

So, in order to be fair, I want to state up front that on the merits of my meal Barbacco deserves four stars.\n\nThe wine list is pretty brief, but seems well curated. I had a lovely glass of dolcetto that stood up to all of my menu selections well.  One of my friends had an outstanding Sangiovese that also worked well with everything and was nice on its own. On our side of the table, we started things off with some nduja (spicy spreadable salami) and a roasted mushroom spread that consisted of chopped mushrooms layered with truffled marscapone. Both starters came in little pots with crostini. Both were rich, satisfying and delicious. I would order either again in a heartbeat. The crostini to spread ratio was a bit off, but the kitchen happily supplied more. On the other side of the table, they opted to try the suppli (risotto cakes stuffed with truffled mozarella) and crostone with burrata and roasted beets. I only had a morsel of each, but both of them were solid choices. For a main, I had the farrotto (farro cooked risotto style) with roasted mushrooms and chesse. It had a wonderful balance of flavors and was particularly soothing for a rainy evening. The potion seemed never ending and I opted to take half of it home. It made a terrific lunch the next day. One of my friends had the flat iron steak (it was on the rare side, which I personally love) and another had the braised chicken thighs. They both seemed really happy with their options. I thought the steak and its accompanying mushrooms were yummy. But something went off kilter when it came to the paccheti (pork ragu). There wasn't much pork in evidence and my friend didn't like the pasta they chose for the dish or the red sauce. I didn't actually try it, but it did seem kind of lackluster. Things got back on track with dessert. The espresso panna cotta had a textbook-perfect texture (so creamy!) and a nice flavor. \n\nThe service was excellent and I really liked the atmosphere.

Until I set foot in Barbacco.  \n\nAfter a disastrous haircut (Thanks, Ringolevio!) I wasn't in the best of mood and was considering heading home and trying to figure out a Plan B as it relates to the haircut.  The only thing that stopped me from going was a dinner date with a globetrottin-girl friend with whom I have not been spending quality time with.  \n\nAt her suggestion, we went to Barbacco.  I love the wine selection and I have to admit (grudgingly) that while I find the whole iPad thing quite tacky, it allows the sorting and searching of my favorite wines.  I settled for a crisp pinot gris and my girl friend, a sweet riesling. \n\nWe were seated at the bar (good: we get to chat with our lovely server.  bad: a lack of personal space) and after mulling over the chilled wine for a short while, we started perusing the menu. \n\nIt sure was an array of tongue twister.  We relied on our server's recommendation and were shortly presented with an array of food:\n1) Bruchette with ricotta, basil, caramelized onion and tomatoes:  \n2) Paccheri  parmigiano reggiano  - rustic pork ragu and parmesan cheese\n3) Farrotto / farro risotto with mushroom\n4) Patate in padella (literal translation: potato casseroles) - pan roasted fingerling potatoes with nduja (spicy Calabrese sausage) bits and caramelized onion\n5) fennel-rubbed pork ribs with shaved fennel salad and roasted lemon\n\nI certainly appreciated the smaller serving - it allowed us to sample different kinds of dishes.  \n\nVerdict: I would come back and order the exact same dishes (finally! Potatoes that can give Los Gatos Cafe's breakfast potatoes the run for their money!), with the exception of the pork ribs which were a tad salty. We definitely ordered one dish too many, for the two of us - we took some of the food home - but, everything else was nothing short of phenomenal and, according to the server, the two of us managed to do a respectable job. \n\nAs I was driving home I realized that the night hasn't really turned out to be a total bust.

It was a Monday night at 8 and every table was full, which is always a good sign. We luckily had reservations and were greeted by a wonderfully friendly hostess, who let us know it would be a few minutes and pointed to an empty space at the counter where we could have a glass of wine and wait. For a place that doesn't actually have a bar, this was a nice option.\nOnce we were seated we instantly ordered the brussel sprouts, not because I knew that they were basically known for them, but because they are my go-to and I order them everywhere I go. We also ordered a bottle of a California Sauvignon Blanc, cause \"when in Rome\". The brussel sprouts come out and it happens...I taste one of the most amazing things I've ever tried!! (Reminder: Brussel sprouts are kind of my thing) They had the perfect amount of seasoning and flavor. You know sometimes you order them and the flavor is good, but you bite into it and your mouth is filled with an over-the-top flavor that messes with palate?? Well these didn't do that...they were perfect in every way.\n\nWe then decided to stick with a couple apps for the time being....we tried the:\n- Seasonal fruit salad with arugula and whipped ricotta cheese - Wow!! These flavor combos were well thought out and fresh as fresh can be! Excellent light start for any meal.\n~ Bruchetta on toast with goat cheese? (don't quote me on that) - Perfect crunch and perfect flavor balance\n\nAfter chatting it up with the two gentlemen beside us, we got friendly enough to offer bites of our competing appetizers....so we also tried..\n\n-Sicilian Meatballs - Delicious and so tender!

It was basically just a sausage without the casing...but a very delicious sausage.\n\nAt this point we were stuffed to the brim, but we had to try the pasta dishes we had ordered before filling ourselves with all the amazing apps (which we didn't regret one bit).

They said it would be a 45 minute wait, but we got lucky with a small corner table, just big enough for three. It was cozy, but doable for a last minute dinner, although there was a cold draft throughout most of our meal. The restaurant seating is a little crowded, with the tables a little too close together and wobbly contemporary chairs that aren't very comfortable to sit on. We could very easily hear the conversations of the two tables next to us.\n\nWe ordered a Burrata appetizer, Vegetarian Meatballs, Corn Fusilli, the Fettuccine, and the Chocolate Nemesis Cake for dessert. The Burrata was great, definitely an appetizer you can't go wrong with.\n\nOf the entire meal, my favorite was the Corn Fusilli - the pesto seemed to lack salt, but the texture of the dish was what really got me. The sweet corn kernels added a great \"crunch\" to contrast with the al dente pasta. I added a little bit of salt and I have a tendency to put chili flakes on everything, so those added a little extra flavor for me too, but even without those, the dish really stood out.\n\nThe Fettuccine was alright - while the pasta was well-made, I wanted the dish to be a little creamier. Instead, it came across a little watery and didn't really come together for me.\n\nThe Vegetarian \"Meatballs\" are made with Impossible brand meat, and it's great to see a prominent upscale restaurant offering these options. The texture of the meatballs is soft and every bite bursts with flavor. As a vegetarian who isn't used to meaty textures, this dish is a little bit of an adjustment, and it's definitely geared towards meat-eaters trying to incorporate vegetarian meals into their diet. Nonetheless, it's a well-made dish that deserves 4 stars for both effort and execution.\n\nFinally, we ended our evening with the Chocolate Nemesis Cake. The slice was very dense, more like a solidified mousse than a cake. It was good we shared the slice between three people as a couple of bites was more than enough for all of us. I didn't care too much for the candied hazelnuts - the smokey flavor was too overpowering. The presentation also left much to be desired. The other dishes came out neatly plated, but it seemed the the cream and hazelnuts on the cake were just thrown onto the plate.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and service was solid.

It offers a sufficient variety to cater to your preferences. They even have corn-based gluten-free fusilli! Although I often scoff at the pointlessness of the gluten-free hype, corn pasta sounds like a creative and delicious idea :P\n\nWe started with BRANDACUJUN (don't ask me how to pronounce it) aka salt cod fritters. It was comparable to salt cod fish cakes at most places, consisting of meatball-shaped cod surrounded by a golden panko coating. Each of the 3 accompanying aioli tasted distinctly different, though I don't remember the descriptions the server introduced to us. At $11 for 3 fritters it's a bit pricey (and difficult to share because it crumbles when you cut it in half), but noteworthy and appetizing indeed.\n\nAt first it bothered me that the FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($6) were so inconsistent, with some pieces dry and plain while other pieces were doused to a pungent tangyness in the red wine vinaigrette.

I quickly came to appreciate how the dish showcases the fascinating diversity in something as simple as fried Brussels sprouts. (Just like how SF adores the variation of basic avo toasts)\n\nThe risotto was the reason we came to visit (I had been on something of a risotto quest for boo's cravings). While it was not the absolute best risotto I've ever had, it was memorable and exemplified the same culinary finesse of creating a signature dish from simple ingredients. Named the FARROTTO ($15), the \"risotto\" was farro-based for a heartier, grainier texture and a more complex, earthier flavor profile. The farro was more chewy and fell short of the intriguingly al dente firmness of traditional risotto, but the savory parmigiano reggiano, roasted mushrooms, and spinach gave a nice oomph. Overall I liked the spin and the healthier approach in contrast to the typically creamy, rich composition.\n\nI didn't know what to expect of the LUMACHE ($17; featuring green \"snail-shaped\" pasta), and it turned out to be another interesting and unique pasta creation. The lamb sugo was braised melty soft (and came in a surprisingly generous portion) blended with a bold arrabiata-like spicy tomato sauce, a garnish of cool mint leaves, and sharp pecorino cheese. The pasta was notably al dente, and the snail shape was excellent for scooping up sauce. \n\nThe dining experience at Barbacco has its share of class and stellar Italian cuisine, yet it remains casual and comfortable. (The nearby Perbacco is its fancier sibling.) True to its name, Barbacco includes a long row of bar seating (with extremely comfortable bar stools) along one side of the restaurant.\n\nThe verdict?

(which tasted like creamy bacon pasta! Yum.) \n\nFried Polenta $5: Parmigiano and rosemary. -fried into little cubes, slightly dense but had a light rosemary fragrance and dusted parmesan like it was salt seasoning. Mmmm! \n\nFried Brussels Sprouts $6: Capers, anchovy and red wine vinaigrette. -omg get this!! Soo good, especially if you like a prominent vinegar taste that's been cooked down. \n\nEverything came to be around $80 which is pretty pricey for lunch but there were leftovers and definitely enough food for 3 people! \n\n(The pate bruschetta was so good that I ordered another 3 piece togo..lol)", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-14"}, {"excerpts": ["FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS capers / anchovy / red wine vinaigrette - 4.5 stars - SO GOOD!

I wished the lonza / roasted grapes / saba one had more pork and the grapes rolled off so it was awkward to eat.  The truffled lardo was too much.  (Yes, there is such a thing as being too rich!)

The red wine vinaigrette that they were tossed in was amazingly salty and tangy.  I could have eaten a bowl of these!

Techie BF liked this very much.  Non-techie me thought it would be gimmicky but actually it worked well.  It was organized by types of wines and regions.  Once you made your selection, you could learn more than you ever wanted to know about the wine and then order by the taste, glass, quarto, mezzo, or bottle.  My taste of Prosecco was lacking in the bubbles department ($5.50) but BF liked his glass of Cabernet Sauvignon blend just fine ($9). \n\n2)  The Company\n\n(Good save BF!)\n\nNote:  I've also ordered takeout from Barbacco for lunch and it's a nice treat from the usual FiDi routine.

Fortunately, her services are very much in demand, so she quit. To celebrate her self-proclaimed emancipation, we had dinner at Barbacco.\n\nBarbacco is a well appointed, modern, trendy & hip take on traditional, casual Italian dining. We had reservations which did insure we would have seating, but not at our own table as the seating is either at 1 of a row of long communal tables or along the bar. Service was mostly attentive, considering it was very busy. Our server was deadpan, but the rest of the staff was warm with lots of smiles.\n\nWhile the food menu was on long, narrow paper stock, the beverages were listed on iPads located on each table & on the bar. Like many things Apple, this approach was entertainingly novel but didn't provide any true functional enhancement. The food selection is very faithful to authentic Italian, meaning if you don't read or otherwise know Italian you may not know what a dish is. Lucky for me, the girlfriend lived in Italy a while & more or less translated the menu.\n\nInstead of offering composed meals, everything is a la carte. The girlfriend & I picked out our own combinations of starter/ entree/ side. She got Spicy Braised Tripe, Paccheri w/ Rustic Pork Ragu & Parmigiano Reggiano, Fried Brussels Sprouts. I got Duck Cotechino Sausage, Orecchiette or \"little ears\" in Cavolo Nero w/ Fennel Sausage & Pecorino Cheese, Roasted Squash. The food took a while, so we had a couple beers & chomped on bread (which was good) while waiting.\n\nWhen the dishes started coming out, I was reminded of the oxymoron \"jumbo shrimp.\" All 6 of our dishes were like giant tapas. Trying all 6, all were well-made & delicious but 3 of the dishes had bigger, bolder flavors than the other 3. The Spicy Braised Tripe, Orecchiette & Fried Brussels Sprouts were sensational with huge flavor. The flavors of these 3 dishes also complemented each other extremely well, making this a fantastic trio to order together. The Duck Cotechino Sausage, Paccheri & Roasted Squash were still nice, but paled in comparison. Though less intensely flavorful, these 3 dishes also complemented each other well & would be a good trio.\n\nAfter polishing off so many big little plates of food, we still found room for a piece of Chocolate Nemesis Cake. OK, it's true. The name alone was a significant factor in my wanting this dessert. Though it had an abundance of deep, rich chocolate & a substantial cookie-like crust, this chocolate cake wasn't overly intimidating in any particular way. So, despite the name, the Chocolate Nemesis Cake was easily vanquished. Scrumptiously & gratifyingly, but easily.\n\nBarbacco is an interesting & somewhat quirky new take on Italian dining.

That was the perfect solution, as the wines were our primary focus for the evening. The food, if good, would only heighten the experience. But it turned out that both food and wine were equal partners in the evening's successes--and excesses.\n\nWith five or so offerings in each section (salumi, cheeses, bruschette, pastas, secondi, and sides) it was hard to make a decision. Fortunately, visiting NPA wine expert Hardy offered up his recommendations and suggested wine pairings.\n\nThe sausage-stuffed deep-fried olives and the nduja partnered perfectly with our Pinot Gris, as promised. At the risk of offending the Boccalone gods, I think I preferred this version of the spreadable salami.

Lunchtime diners were packed in elbow to elbow, giving me flashbacks of that horrendous evening at A16 when we were practically sitting on top of our neighbors. \n\nIf you're considering Barbacco for a first date, look for another spot.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-03-31"}, {"excerpts": ["fried brussels sprouts: \ni don't quite understand this city's craze with fried brussels sprouts.

BUT - nothing but a couple drops of lemon juice can't fix :) magic touch and it was beautiful. \n\nmeatballs!:\nflavorful, but not my fav. \n\nfried brussels sprouts: \ni don't quite understand this city's craze with fried brussels sprouts. dissatisfied at spqr i decided to give it another try. ehhhhh. there is nothing crispy about it. the vinegar is slightly overpowering. though: it's not bad the day after chopped up and mixed with pasta. woot. \n\nhalf way through our meatballs, M caught a small, 2mm rock in his mouth. he was fine, but i alerted the waitstaff of it, so they can let the kitchen now. minutes later, the store manager came to apologize, and offered complimentary dessert. \n\nwe thought it was going to be a piece of cake: they came out with a fruit tart, two gelatto, and a piece of flowerless chocolate cake to PERFECTION. \n\n\"wow, you really want us to come back!\" said M. and that.. we just might :)", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-08-21"}, {"excerpts": ["Do not miss the burrata or the duck fat fried brussels sprouts.

The high chairs are weird for someone short.  They're not good for the back.  That is why this place is so chic.  You'll be asked what kind of water you want.

My colleague had the Arugula and Radicchio salad along with the Lasagne Bolognese.  He's a regular here and swears by it; the presentation was very nice.  I started with the Heart of Romaine Salad and my lunch entree was the \"Peposo\" (tuscan beef stew braised with creamy polenta).  Yes the lunch was great and the food alone is worth 5 stars.  So where is the miss?  Barbacco is definitely an upscale trattoria.  There are plenty of small hole in the wall restaurants and dives with superb food out there too (but they are missing the ambiance and service and are priced accordingly).  And on a place like that I would have only reviewed the food.  But when I go to any upscale place, I look for more than just the food.  It's about the total experience (and the meals in upscale places are priced to reflect that total experience).  That experience is comprised of 1. the meal itself, 2. the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant, and 3. the service.\n\nThe miss for me was the service.  This was my first time in this place and we did have reservations.  As soon as gave them our name, they walked us to the counter.  We asked if we could instead be seated at a table; the host seamed very bothered by this request but walked us to a table.  The server came by to take our order.  We both ordered an Arnold Palmer and our meals.  Drinks came out promptly and shortly followed with our meals.  However my drink ran dry early during my meal and I definitely needed another drink (or a glass of water).  I kept looking for our server but never saw him during our meal.  We didn't see our server again until the end of our meal when he asked us if we wanted desert; then quietly dropped off our check at the table.  I expect our server to stop by at least once during the meal to check on us (make sure everything was ok), and to also occasionally glance at the table to see if anything needs attention, such as empty glasses.  I understand lunchtime is busy, but this lack of attention to your guests is a total turn off for me.\n\nAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch (it definitely was great), as a first timer in this place, I was turned off by the service (or lack there of).  If they would have had the service element down, this would have been 5 starts instead of 4.  It's unlikely I'll come back as there are too many great options in a city like San Francisco.  And although the food is great and the place is packed, these things catch up with restaurants once the word gets out.\n\nAgain:\nFood = 5 stars\nAmbiance = 5 stars\nService = 2 stars\n----------------\nOverall Average = 4 stars\n----------------", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-01-19"}, {"excerpts": ["My Arnold Palmer  was 90% lemonade and had to be sent back.
