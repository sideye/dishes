"], "author": "Jackson B.", "review": "My review is more fun than the others.  Also pretty damn informative.  Read it.  :D\n\nFirst let me praise:\n\nThe Egg Foo Young -  I could eat this _every time_ an egg dish is calling to me.  Of course, breakfast would be a natural fit, but WOW... they make the best EFY.  I could eat it anytime and be just as happy.  \n\nThe chicken variety I had recently was like Chinese Soul Food.  We're talkin' tasty **chicken gravy** over three (seemed more like 4 or 5!) fresh eggs, perfectly cooked, tender and fluffeeee.  The portion was generous enough that you'll either want to split it with a buddy, or have it at home so you can stick it in the fridge and do the aforementioned breakfast thing.  I'm thinkin' WAFFLES on the side would be the ultimate brekkie I could ever have... wow..\n\nA big 5 star stamp * * * * * from me on this dish.  I'm going to eat this everyday the next time I get a cold, which doesn't stand a chance against of Soul Food this Holy. \n\nThen let me get into:\n\nPork Buns!  Excuse me.. *BBQ* Pork Buns!  Holy ****!  I thought having grown up in SF meant I'd had the best PB's by now.  I was wrong!  You actually taste the BBQ-ness in the meat.. none of that unpalatable, slimy fat texture happenin' like what you get at most of the sidewalk dim sum joints; just sweet, tangy unadulterated Bar-Be-Que'd Pork with just the right amount of chewing resistance - not tough, not pablum, but meaty.. the way it should be.  Mine were baked and the pair of perfect brown buns made me feel for one hot second like I was on a beach in Brazil :)  I forgot to remove the semi-invisible white paper on the bottom due to being ravenously hungry.. on the first bun :)  That's ok, a little roughage never hurt anyone.  5 whole stars!  Why?  Read it again.\n\nAnd finally (for this excursion):\n\nDiced Chicken with Cashew Nuts.  Menu-described as: pan fried diced chicken with zucchini, celery and cashew nuts.  Sounds good, huh?  Welp, no celery...\nabout 7 cashews... lots of zucchini! (too much!).  AND, the sauce was watery.  Didn't stick to the above, which means the overall flavor was Bland unless eaten like a stew, with a big ol' spoon.  HOWEVER, once again, my peeps at Tsing Tao came through with the big ass portion.  Ok, maybe if you're hungry enough to hunt down and eat a moose, this would be one meal.  But if you eat like reg'lar folks, this could easily be your lunch and dinner.  Three-ish stars, bordering on 2.5.  Why?  Shaky prep. \n\nBackstory:\n\nMy folks took me here with my bro when we little tykes.  I've been in SF all my life, and it was the 1st place I had Chinese food.  Back in the day, I always seemed to end up with some combo of sizzling rice soup, mongolian beef, sweet and sour prawns or chicken, rice and 7up.  TT has been there awhile now!  The portions have increased in persons-feedable capacity, the food has been great from then to now, and I'm going back again this week.  Moving to Little Russia (about 15 blocks away from the best Chinese food at TT) was a great move.  There's a helluva lot of good food out here.   \n\nSo, by my math, 5 stars + 5 stars + 2.5 stars = 4 stars.  You can check this on your calculator, but I'm right.  They'll probably get 4.5 stars if people wise up to what's good on the menu and quit complaining about their first world problems.  We live like Royalty compared to A LOT of people in the world.

It's about $2-3 more expensive than their other entr\u00e9es, but I would say it's worth it. The chicken is sweet (but not too sweet), the walnuts on the side add a great crunch, and together with fried rice, it will make your taste buds pretty happy. \n\nWhen I lived in the Outer Richmond, Tsing Tao was my go-to restaurant whenever I was too lazy to make dinner for myself. I would order on the phone and within 10 minutes, my meal would be ready. Having that meal ready in 10 minutes is a little sketchy because it makes you question how freshly-made the food is, but when you get as hungry as I do, you tend not to care. \n\nNow, I live in the Outer Sunset where there are more options for Chinese restaurants, but Tsing Tao still remains my go-to restaurant when I am craving Chinese food. It is a $20 minimum for delivery and it generally takes about 25-30 minutes for my food to get to my house. \n\nI would also recommend Tsing Tao for lunch. For their lunch menu, most meals cost no more than $8 and it comes with a decent portion of rice and a good portion of meat. Definitely not a bad place to grab a quick, cheap lunch. \n\nOverall, you can consider me a Tsing Tao regular.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-01-21"}], "roasted half duck": [], "general taos chicken": [], "orange flavor chicken": [], "chicken mushu": [], "pork mushu": [], "mandarin sauce pork": [], "pork with house special eggplant": [], "pork with asparagus": [], "crystal sparkling water": [], "singaporestyle noodle": [], "soup noodle": [], "rice sticks": [], "original pekingstyle spaghetti": [], "hot plate combination": [], "fried  shrimps": [], "green onion pan cake": [], "foil wrapped chicken": [], "sauteed string bean": [], "fried string bean with chili sauce": [], "braised bean curd": [{"excerpts": ["I ordered a braised bean curd entree which was pretty good, but not anything to rave about.\n\n"], "author": "Rachel T.", "review": "My review is just for the food that I ordered for delivery; I have not been to the restaurant. \n\nMy meal was decent.
