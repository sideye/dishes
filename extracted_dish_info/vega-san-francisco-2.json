The artichoke hearts were soft and tender. The prosciutto was seared so it had a bite to it and the pesto/mixed green balance everything out.

My first bite was just ok. Added  some salt and I was good to go.\n\nPizza Margherita add sausage and 2 eggs: Greatly done pizza! Everything on the pizza was fresh and rich. The dough was thin and had a great crunch. My only complaint is the pizza was slightly warm when it was served. I was expecting something hot and bubbly.\n\nHouse Wine: $5 for glass of good wine.\n\nComplimentary Bread and Olive Oil: Bread was dense, but I think thats the authentic version.\n\nLong wait to get seated. The waiter told us to come back in 30 mins, when we did she had no idea who we were so we had to wait another 15-20 mins for seats to clear up. Once we sat down our order was taken quickly but it took another 40 minutes for our food to come out. We didnt mind the wait so much because we were busy talking, but some people might not be as patient.\n\nWhen we asked for the check they brought out their Panna Cotta desert ON THE HOUSE!

They are on open table, but we were going pretty late on a Saturday night so figured we did not need a reservation. We were able to walk in, and got a nice table near the window immediately.  The menu looked simply fabulous, and we had a hard time deciding what we wanted.  My one problem with traditional Italian restaurants is I have to point at the menu... I cannot pronounce anything to order it. \n\nWe settled on sharing an app, and then splitting a pizza and a pasta.  This was plenty of food for the two of us. \n\nThey brought us wonderful bread and olive oil.  The bread was dense and almost doughy and was a perfect start.  Its always nice to get bread and olive oil to start, and not having to ask.  They brought plenty, but we were hungry and refilled our bread without a problem. \n\nFor our appetizer we got CARCIOFINI RIPIENI, per the menu this is described as \"Warmed artichoke hearts stuffed w/ goat cheese, wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, pesto and mixed greens.\" I describe this as \"OH MY F** GOOD GOD\".  Wow.  Out of this world.  Something I have never had, in a flavor combination that was spectacular and well balanced.  Nothing stood out, the flavors all just went well together. If I had any complaints it would would be too small to share for more than 2 people. \n\nFor our entrees we split the PIZZA BRESAOLA & RUGHETTA and GNOCCHI ALLA BOSCAIOLA.  The pizza was perfect.  Perfect Naples style pizza. The flavors were awesome, the bresaola was some of the best I have ever had and it was topped with an arugula salad that was yummy and worked with the pizza.\n\nThe Gnocchi was wonderful.  Perfect little pillows of love that were so tender and delicate but stood up to the mushroom and sausage sauce. \n\nThe desserts looked fabulous, but had no room for it.  We took our left overs home.  They wrapped them for us, which is such a nice touch.  I hate when you have left overs and they just hand you a box.  It is such a nice touch of service when they take your plates and wrap your items in the back and present them nicely to you.\n\nOn that though, the pizza was delicious in the morning, however the gnocchi did not reheat well.  We would have been better powering through dinner and eating all we could rather than take some home.  Totally not their fault though...\n\nIf you go, definitely order family style so you have multiple tastes.  I cannot wait to go back.\n\nOnly two downfalls is 1) its in Bernal Heights, someplace that I normally don't go or have a reason to hang out it. and 2) no fountain soda.

This dish with truffle oil sausage and mushrooms is lovely. While truffles are delicious, the quantity of truffle oil is just a tad overpowering but the dish overall is still very good.\n\nPizza Cappricciosa - The pizza crust is crunchy thin Neapolitan style. The toppings on this pizza - prosciutto, egg, mushrooms, artichoke and mozzarella are lovely accompaniments but I think the composition is a little lacking. Everything slides off the crust a little too easily. Be forewarned as well, only half your pizza will contain prosciutto and half will contain the artichoke and egg. Not sure why the whole pizza isn't covered with all toppings.\n\nA side of broccoli rabbe provides some greens to accompany your pasta - tasty but be forewarned, very overpowering on the garlic however expertly cooked al dente.\n\nThis restaurant also stays open until 10pm which is nice because many places around here close at 9 or 9:30.

Just kidding, fellas!\n\nFor a last minute GNO, I suggested going to Vega for dinner because I had a solid meal on my first visit and parking is plentiful. Vega is not a destination restaurant by any means but if you're in the area and looking for a simple, tasty, and satisfying Italian meal than look no further than Vega. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable. On Tuesdays, kid's pizzas are 50% off and on Wednesdays, bottles of wine are 50% off.\n\nOn my two visits, I've tried the following (sorry for the poor quality pics):\n*Carpaccio di Polipo: Octopus carpaccio ($10): http://bit.ly/1uR2I8T\n*Tortino di Granchio: Dungeness crab w/ avocado, cucumber & endive ($14): http://bit.ly/Zo3r7B\n*Impepata Di Vongole E Cozze: Mussels w/ garlic, chili flakes, parsley & white wine ($12): http://bit.ly/1qYU1J1\n*Quattro Formaggi Pizza: Mozzarella, fontina, goat cheese, gorgonzola, & pear ($15 + $4 for prosciutto & egg): http://bit.ly/1oVs6GJ\n*Pizza Capricciosa: Homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms & egg  ($15): http://bit.ly/XcfdAi\n*Pappardelle Al Ragu: Papparadelle w/ beef, pork & lamb ($18): http://bit.ly/1mb4MZz\n*Costolette Di Agnello: Rack of lamb w/ roasted polenta & white truffle oil ($22): http://bit.ly/1mb4WjG\n*Panna Cotta & Vanilla Gelato ($8 + $3): http://bit.ly/1s50qWx\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their seafood apps. They're fresh and chock full of seafood goodness. My favorite is the mussels in the white wine broth. The broth is robust with a nice kick; it was an addicting dip for the grilled bread. \n\nI enjoyed the thin crust pizza on my first visit (quattro formaggi). It was crispy throughout with a perfectly cooked egg that oozed upon poking. I didn't have the same luck with the pizza capricciosa on my second visit. The middle was soggy upon arrival and the egg had a fully cooked yolk. *sad pouty lip* \n\nIf you have value on your mind, then I would opt for Vega's pastas over their pizzas. The portions are HUGE. My papparadelle could easy feed 2 hungry people. The sheets of pasta were perfectly al-dente and lightly tossed in a flavorful, thick ragu sauce. Really liked the trio of meats; the lamb added a subtle gamey bite. Rustic and comforting. \n\nI had a taste of the tender rack of lamb (medium rare) which was meaty, juicy, and downright delicious. It was a special of the night (first visit) and I would highly recommend this dish if it's available and if you're feeling like a carniwhore that night.\n\nIf you still have room in your tummy, then the panna cotta is a great way to end dinner. It's firm yet lightly smooth with a refreshing hint of lemon.\n\nService is everything you would expect from a good neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, and attentive. Much better than what I've experienced at their other restaurants (Liberty Caf\u00e9/Bernal Star).\n\nThe ambiance is dim, a little cramped, and old skool. Great for a casual date but not for parties larger than 4. \n\nFor our GNO party of 4, we shared 2 apps, one pizza, 4 entrees, and each had a glass of wine. The total was only $43 pp including tip plus we each had a doggy bag to bring home. \n\nLeaving with a food baby to go home to comfortably plop on the couch and watch Lifetime Movie Network sure beats nursing a hangover, bruises, and a twisted ankle from toppling over because I walk in heels like a baby giraffe in roller skates...after 7 shots.\n\nHmmm, I wonder how GNO in our 40s will be like...a little Magic Mike action?", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Tortino di Granchio ($14) - Good & refreshing.

Just kidding, fellas!\n\nFor a last minute GNO, I suggested going to Vega for dinner because I had a solid meal on my first visit and parking is plentiful. Vega is not a destination restaurant by any means but if you're in the area and looking for a simple, tasty, and satisfying Italian meal than look no further than Vega. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable. On Tuesdays, kid's pizzas are 50% off and on Wednesdays, bottles of wine are 50% off.\n\nOn my two visits, I've tried the following (sorry for the poor quality pics):\n*Carpaccio di Polipo: Octopus carpaccio ($10): http://bit.ly/1uR2I8T\n*Tortino di Granchio: Dungeness crab w/ avocado, cucumber & endive ($14): http://bit.ly/Zo3r7B\n*Impepata Di Vongole E Cozze: Mussels w/ garlic, chili flakes, parsley & white wine ($12): http://bit.ly/1qYU1J1\n*Quattro Formaggi Pizza: Mozzarella, fontina, goat cheese, gorgonzola, & pear ($15 + $4 for prosciutto & egg): http://bit.ly/1oVs6GJ\n*Pizza Capricciosa: Homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms & egg  ($15): http://bit.ly/XcfdAi\n*Pappardelle Al Ragu: Papparadelle w/ beef, pork & lamb ($18): http://bit.ly/1mb4MZz\n*Costolette Di Agnello: Rack of lamb w/ roasted polenta & white truffle oil ($22): http://bit.ly/1mb4WjG\n*Panna Cotta & Vanilla Gelato ($8 + $3): http://bit.ly/1s50qWx\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their seafood apps. They're fresh and chock full of seafood goodness. My favorite is the mussels in the white wine broth. The broth is robust with a nice kick; it was an addicting dip for the grilled bread. \n\nI enjoyed the thin crust pizza on my first visit (quattro formaggi). It was crispy throughout with a perfectly cooked egg that oozed upon poking. I didn't have the same luck with the pizza capricciosa on my second visit. The middle was soggy upon arrival and the egg had a fully cooked yolk. *sad pouty lip* \n\nIf you have value on your mind, then I would opt for Vega's pastas over their pizzas. The portions are HUGE. My papparadelle could easy feed 2 hungry people. The sheets of pasta were perfectly al-dente and lightly tossed in a flavorful, thick ragu sauce. Really liked the trio of meats; the lamb added a subtle gamey bite. Rustic and comforting. \n\nI had a taste of the tender rack of lamb (medium rare) which was meaty, juicy, and downright delicious. It was a special of the night (first visit) and I would highly recommend this dish if it's available and if you're feeling like a carniwhore that night.\n\nIf you still have room in your tummy, then the panna cotta is a great way to end dinner. It's firm yet lightly smooth with a refreshing hint of lemon.\n\nService is everything you would expect from a good neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, and attentive. Much better than what I've experienced at their other restaurants (Liberty Caf\u00e9/Bernal Star).\n\nThe ambiance is dim, a little cramped, and old skool. Great for a casual date but not for parties larger than 4. \n\nFor our GNO party of 4, we shared 2 apps, one pizza, 4 entrees, and each had a glass of wine. The total was only $43 pp including tip plus we each had a doggy bag to bring home. \n\nLeaving with a food baby to go home to comfortably plop on the couch and watch Lifetime Movie Network sure beats nursing a hangover, bruises, and a twisted ankle from toppling over because I walk in heels like a baby giraffe in roller skates...after 7 shots.\n\nHmmm, I wonder how GNO in our 40s will be like...a little Magic Mike action?", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["it tasted like prosciutto for some reason.\n\n"], "author": "Anders Z.", "review": "This place was straight up amazing!\n\nI went with a very close friend of mine one spring weekend, and dare I say...

Needless to say, we looked elsewhere.\n\nI'd been saving a dinner at Vega for a date night but decided to give the restaurant a call anyway to see if they could seat us quickly.

The menu looked simply fabulous, and we had a hard time deciding what we wanted.  My one problem with traditional Italian restaurants is I have to point at the menu... I cannot pronounce anything to order it. \n\nWe settled on sharing an app, and then splitting a pizza and a pasta.  This was plenty of food for the two of us. \n\nThey brought us wonderful bread and olive oil.  The bread was dense and almost doughy and was a perfect start.  Its always nice to get bread and olive oil to start, and not having to ask.  They brought plenty, but we were hungry and refilled our bread without a problem. \n\nFor our appetizer we got CARCIOFINI RIPIENI, per the menu this is described as \"Warmed artichoke hearts stuffed w/ goat cheese, wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, pesto and mixed greens.\" I describe this as \"OH MY F** GOOD GOD\".  Wow.  Out of this world.  Something I have never had, in a flavor combination that was spectacular and well balanced.  Nothing stood out, the flavors all just went well together. If I had any complaints it would would be too small to share for more than 2 people. \n\nFor our entrees we split the PIZZA BRESAOLA & RUGHETTA and GNOCCHI ALLA BOSCAIOLA.  The pizza was perfect.  Perfect Naples style pizza. The flavors were awesome, the bresaola was some of the best I have ever had and it was topped with an arugula salad that was yummy and worked with the pizza.\n\nThe Gnocchi was wonderful.  Perfect little pillows of love that were so tender and delicate but stood up to the mushroom and sausage sauce. \n\nThe desserts looked fabulous, but had no room for it.  We took our left overs home.  They wrapped them for us, which is such a nice touch.  I hate when you have left overs and they just hand you a box.  It is such a nice touch of service when they take your plates and wrap your items in the back and present them nicely to you.\n\nOn that though, the pizza was delicious in the morning, however the gnocchi did not reheat well.  We would have been better powering through dinner and eating all we could rather than take some home.  Totally not their fault though...\n\nIf you go, definitely order family style so you have multiple tastes.  I cannot wait to go back.\n\nOnly two downfalls is 1) its in Bernal Heights, someplace that I normally don't go or have a reason to hang out it. and 2) no fountain soda.

For the table, we went with Pizza Ai Funghi which is essentially mushroom pizza with truffle oil (because anything with truffle is always amazing). The pizza came out very thin and crispy just as I like it and the mushroom portion was generous. If you wanted parmesan cheese on top of any of your dishes, they will bring out a block and a very long grater and grate your cheese in front of you (drools). The pizza was gone within 5 minutes.\n\nFor the pasta dishes, our table got Boscaiola, Capellini Al Granchio and Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia E Calamari. The Boscaiola is handmade gnocchi with mushroom, Italian sausage, parmigiana and white truffle oil. Not only was the flavor amazing but their gnocchi was really good and fresh. It was not my dish but I definitely was eating a lot of it (sorry to my friend that I stole the gnocchi from). The Capellini Al Granchio is my all-time favorite and my highly recommended dish here. It is angel hair pasta with fresh Dungeness crabmeat, tomatoes, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. The portion is big and there is enough Dungeness crabmeat that I had a piece at every bite. I really like how light this dish sits in my stomach but it is packed with flavor. On top of that, angel hair is a pasta that can overcook or undercook easily due to how thin it is but it is always cooked perfectly here. My second highly recommended dish here is the Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia E Calamari, which essentially is squid ink linguine with calamari, garlic and parsley. The pasta is cooked perfectly and flavor is amazing. If you haven't had squid ink anything, I highly recommend it (unless of course if you're allergic to it).\n\nThough we didn't order it during this dinner, I would recommend the Polpette E Polenta as well because the meatballs are amazing. Overall, I definitely highly recommend this place. The pizzas are great and the pasta is amazing as well. The place is small so try to either make reservations or go early and if you're into wine, go for wine Wednesday!\n\nTLDR: One of the best Italian place with amazing food and  1/2 priced bottle wine on Wednesday.\n\nAtmosphere: 4 out of 5 (intimate but it can get a bit loud)\nFood: 5 out of 5\nService: 5 out of 5\nPresentation: 4 out of 5", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Fluffly pillows of goodness, creamy savory sauce, delicious mushrooms and italian sausage.

"], "author": "Adam B.", "review": "I can't say enough good things about this place. My wife and I are foodies and wine connouissiers, and Vega sets the standard for what a small Italian restaurant should be. Yes, it's small and in Bernal Heights and if you don't have a reservation, you can expect to wait a while for a table... and even if you do have a reservation, if it's super busy you might have to wait a bit. But,  you can get some wine while you wait, and once you're seated you will be very well taken care of. This is not one of those so-called five-star chain restaurants. This is a tiny \"hole in the wall\" family run place. It's not that big, and its reputation is such that you should expect it to be busy during peak periods, possibly with a line going out the door. The kitchen is large enough for about 3 chefs to work in and they can only put out so much food in a certain amount of time. \n\nMy wife and I have been here several times now and each visit was excellent. If this place seems authentic, it's because it is! Vega, is the owner. She's there pretty much all the time and has an excellent staff supporting her. Each morning, her husband calls his mother in Italy to work out the day's specials, etc. All the pasta is hand-made, etc. There is no way to rush preparation of food this quality. It just takes dedication and patience. If you come here and it's crowded and noisy, that's a sign that they have kept their prices reasonable and the food delicious. Don't be discouraged, just hang in there and wait for a table and be glad they're not asking for twice as much money. They could easily do that and it would still be worth it. They keep the prices reasonable because we all deserve to be able to enjoy this food.\n\nFirst: the wine. They offer an excellent selection of wines by the glass as well as by the bottle. If you're going by the glass, get the Sangiovese. Heck, even by the bottle, it's a good value. If you really want to splurge, go for a bottle of Brunello di Montalicino. Awesome stuff. \n\nWe've had an appetizer called Involtini di Mare here, it's a wonderful combination of shrimp, mango, avocado, and smoked salmon. Get it. \n\nI really love the gnocci here. Gnocci is a potato dumpling style pasta, it's hand-rolled and always cooked to perfection here. Each bite is a bite of heaven. Having had it on my first visit (and it's one of their specialties), each time I come here, I struggle to avoid ordering it, so I can try something new.  There are two forms it comes in: \"della casa\", which is basically just the dumplings with sauce, or \"alla boscaiola\", which comes with mushrooms, (amazing) Italian sausage, and truffle oil.  Both are good, but the extra mushrooms and sausage push the second one slightly ahead in my preferences.\n\nMy wife similarly struggles with the braised pork ribs.

I have also tried the ice cream with espresso poured over it, and that's really good too. My wife says that the Tiramisu is priceless. They don't always have it on the menu, ask for it. It's the best one she has ever had, and she tries it in every high-end italian restaurant we go to. I concur.\n\nApparently, they are known for their pizza!

Just kidding, fellas!\n\nFor a last minute GNO, I suggested going to Vega for dinner because I had a solid meal on my first visit and parking is plentiful. Vega is not a destination restaurant by any means but if you're in the area and looking for a simple, tasty, and satisfying Italian meal than look no further than Vega. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable. On Tuesdays, kid's pizzas are 50% off and on Wednesdays, bottles of wine are 50% off.\n\nOn my two visits, I've tried the following (sorry for the poor quality pics):\n*Carpaccio di Polipo: Octopus carpaccio ($10): http://bit.ly/1uR2I8T\n*Tortino di Granchio: Dungeness crab w/ avocado, cucumber & endive ($14): http://bit.ly/Zo3r7B\n*Impepata Di Vongole E Cozze: Mussels w/ garlic, chili flakes, parsley & white wine ($12): http://bit.ly/1qYU1J1\n*Quattro Formaggi Pizza: Mozzarella, fontina, goat cheese, gorgonzola, & pear ($15 + $4 for prosciutto & egg): http://bit.ly/1oVs6GJ\n*Pizza Capricciosa: Homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms & egg  ($15): http://bit.ly/XcfdAi\n*Pappardelle Al Ragu: Papparadelle w/ beef, pork & lamb ($18): http://bit.ly/1mb4MZz\n*Costolette Di Agnello: Rack of lamb w/ roasted polenta & white truffle oil ($22): http://bit.ly/1mb4WjG\n*Panna Cotta & Vanilla Gelato ($8 + $3): http://bit.ly/1s50qWx\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their seafood apps. They're fresh and chock full of seafood goodness. My favorite is the mussels in the white wine broth. The broth is robust with a nice kick; it was an addicting dip for the grilled bread. \n\nI enjoyed the thin crust pizza on my first visit (quattro formaggi). It was crispy throughout with a perfectly cooked egg that oozed upon poking. I didn't have the same luck with the pizza capricciosa on my second visit. The middle was soggy upon arrival and the egg had a fully cooked yolk. *sad pouty lip* \n\nIf you have value on your mind, then I would opt for Vega's pastas over their pizzas. The portions are HUGE. My papparadelle could easy feed 2 hungry people. The sheets of pasta were perfectly al-dente and lightly tossed in a flavorful, thick ragu sauce. Really liked the trio of meats; the lamb added a subtle gamey bite. Rustic and comforting. \n\nI had a taste of the tender rack of lamb (medium rare) which was meaty, juicy, and downright delicious. It was a special of the night (first visit) and I would highly recommend this dish if it's available and if you're feeling like a carniwhore that night.\n\nIf you still have room in your tummy, then the panna cotta is a great way to end dinner. It's firm yet lightly smooth with a refreshing hint of lemon.\n\nService is everything you would expect from a good neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, and attentive. Much better than what I've experienced at their other restaurants (Liberty Caf\u00e9/Bernal Star).\n\nThe ambiance is dim, a little cramped, and old skool.

The total was only $43 pp including tip plus we each had a doggy bag to bring home. \n\nLeaving with a food baby to go home to comfortably plop on the couch and watch Lifetime Movie Network sure beats nursing a hangover, bruises, and a twisted ankle from toppling over because I walk in heels like a baby giraffe in roller skates...after 7 shots.\n\nHmmm, I wonder how GNO in our 40s will be like...a little Magic Mike action?", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["The pizza was topped with mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom, and egg.

This is one of my favorite Italian places in SF and it's not because of the wine Wednesday, although it is a great incentive. I have been here so many times after our friend introduced it to us, I definitely lost count of how many times I have been here but the last time I was here was about a couple of days ago for dinner.\n\nMy best friend came to visit and her favorite cuisine is Italian, so I had to take her to one of my favorite place in town. We decided to order a pizza for the table and our own pasta dishes on top of that. Though it is carbs on carbs, we have no regret. I really like their pizza here because I'm a fan of thin pizza so that it comes out lighter and crispier and this place is one of my favorite to get pizza because they do just that. For the table, we went with Pizza Ai Funghi which is essentially mushroom pizza with truffle oil (because anything with truffle is always amazing). The pizza came out very thin and crispy just as I like it and the mushroom portion was generous. If you wanted parmesan cheese on top of any of your dishes, they will bring out a block and a very long grater and grate your cheese in front of you (drools). The pizza was gone within 5 minutes.\n\nFor the pasta dishes, our table got Boscaiola, Capellini Al Granchio and Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia E Calamari. The Boscaiola is handmade gnocchi with mushroom, Italian sausage, parmigiana and white truffle oil. Not only was the flavor amazing but their gnocchi was really good and fresh. It was not my dish but I definitely was eating a lot of it (sorry to my friend that I stole the gnocchi from). The Capellini Al Granchio is my all-time favorite and my highly recommended dish here. It is angel hair pasta with fresh Dungeness crabmeat, tomatoes, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. The portion is big and there is enough Dungeness crabmeat that I had a piece at every bite. I really like how light this dish sits in my stomach but it is packed with flavor. On top of that, angel hair is a pasta that can overcook or undercook easily due to how thin it is but it is always cooked perfectly here. My second highly recommended dish here is the Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia E Calamari, which essentially is squid ink linguine with calamari, garlic and parsley. The pasta is cooked perfectly and flavor is amazing. If you haven't had squid ink anything, I highly recommend it (unless of course if you're allergic to it).\n\nThough we didn't order it during this dinner, I would recommend the Polpette E Polenta as well because the meatballs are amazing. Overall, I definitely highly recommend this place. The pizzas are great and the pasta is amazing as well. The place is small so try to either make reservations or go early and if you're into wine, go for wine Wednesday!\n\nTLDR: One of the best Italian place with amazing food and  1/2 priced bottle wine on Wednesday.\n\nAtmosphere: 4 out of 5 (intimate but it can get a bit loud)\nFood: 5 out of 5\nService: 5 out of 5\nPresentation: 4 out of 5", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-05"}, {"excerpts": ["flavors\n\nCAPELLINI AL GRANCHIO\n     "], "author": "S.K.

On Tuesdays, kid's pizzas are 50% off and on Wednesdays, bottles of wine are 50% off.\n\nOn my two visits, I've tried the following (sorry for the poor quality pics):\n*Carpaccio di Polipo: Octopus carpaccio ($10): http://bit.ly/1uR2I8T\n*Tortino di Granchio: Dungeness crab w/ avocado, cucumber & endive ($14): http://bit.ly/Zo3r7B\n*Impepata Di Vongole E Cozze: Mussels w/ garlic, chili flakes, parsley & white wine ($12): http://bit.ly/1qYU1J1\n*Quattro Formaggi Pizza: Mozzarella, fontina, goat cheese, gorgonzola, & pear ($15 + $4 for prosciutto & egg): http://bit.ly/1oVs6GJ\n*Pizza Capricciosa: Homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms & egg  ($15): http://bit.ly/XcfdAi\n*Pappardelle Al Ragu: Papparadelle w/ beef, pork & lamb ($18): http://bit.ly/1mb4MZz\n*Costolette Di Agnello: Rack of lamb w/ roasted polenta & white truffle oil ($22): http://bit.ly/1mb4WjG\n*Panna Cotta & Vanilla Gelato ($8 + $3): http://bit.ly/1s50qWx\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their seafood apps. They're fresh and chock full of seafood goodness. My favorite is the mussels in the white wine broth. The broth is robust with a nice kick; it was an addicting dip for the grilled bread. \n\nI enjoyed the thin crust pizza on my first visit (quattro formaggi). It was crispy throughout with a perfectly cooked egg that oozed upon poking. I didn't have the same luck with the pizza capricciosa on my second visit. The middle was soggy upon arrival and the egg had a fully cooked yolk. *sad pouty lip* \n\nIf you have value on your mind, then I would opt for Vega's pastas over their pizzas. The portions are HUGE. My papparadelle could easy feed 2 hungry people. The sheets of pasta were perfectly al-dente and lightly tossed in a flavorful, thick ragu sauce. Really liked the trio of meats; the lamb added a subtle gamey bite. Rustic and comforting. \n\nI had a taste of the tender rack of lamb (medium rare) which was meaty, juicy, and downright delicious. It was a special of the night (first visit) and I would highly recommend this dish if it's available and if you're feeling like a carniwhore that night.\n\nIf you still have room in your tummy, then the panna cotta is a great way to end dinner. It's firm yet lightly smooth with a refreshing hint of lemon.\n\nService is everything you would expect from a good neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, and attentive. Much better than what I've experienced at their other restaurants (Liberty Caf\u00e9/Bernal Star).\n\nThe ambiance is dim, a little cramped, and old skool. Great for a casual date but not for parties larger than 4. \n\nFor our GNO party of 4, we shared 2 apps, one pizza, 4 entrees, and each had a glass of wine. The total was only $43 pp including tip plus we each had a doggy bag to bring home. \n\nLeaving with a food baby to go home to comfortably plop on the couch and watch Lifetime Movie Network sure beats nursing a hangover, bruises, and a twisted ankle from toppling over because I walk in heels like a baby giraffe in roller skates...after 7 shots.\n\nHmmm, I wonder how GNO in our 40s will be like...a little Magic Mike action?", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["The bread wasn't good, the goat cheese salad had only a tiny amount of goat cheese, and the roasted polenta was gross.\n\n"], "author": "Gabriela W.", "review": "We had a reservation for 8p for my mom's bday (made it on Seatme).

"], "author": "Adam B.", "review": "I can't say enough good things about this place. My wife and I are foodies and wine connouissiers, and Vega sets the standard for what a small Italian restaurant should be. Yes, it's small and in Bernal Heights and if you don't have a reservation, you can expect to wait a while for a table... and even if you do have a reservation, if it's super busy you might have to wait a bit. But,  you can get some wine while you wait, and once you're seated you will be very well taken care of. This is not one of those so-called five-star chain restaurants. This is a tiny \"hole in the wall\" family run place. It's not that big, and its reputation is such that you should expect it to be busy during peak periods, possibly with a line going out the door. The kitchen is large enough for about 3 chefs to work in and they can only put out so much food in a certain amount of time. \n\nMy wife and I have been here several times now and each visit was excellent. If this place seems authentic, it's because it is! Vega, is the owner. She's there pretty much all the time and has an excellent staff supporting her. Each morning, her husband calls his mother in Italy to work out the day's specials, etc. All the pasta is hand-made, etc. There is no way to rush preparation of food this quality. It just takes dedication and patience. If you come here and it's crowded and noisy, that's a sign that they have kept their prices reasonable and the food delicious. Don't be discouraged, just hang in there and wait for a table and be glad they're not asking for twice as much money. They could easily do that and it would still be worth it. They keep the prices reasonable because we all deserve to be able to enjoy this food.\n\nFirst: the wine. They offer an excellent selection of wines by the glass as well as by the bottle. If you're going by the glass, get the Sangiovese. Heck, even by the bottle, it's a good value. If you really want to splurge, go for a bottle of Brunello di Montalicino. Awesome stuff. \n\nWe've had an appetizer called Involtini di Mare here, it's a wonderful combination of shrimp, mango, avocado, and smoked salmon. Get it. \n\nI really love the gnocci here. Gnocci is a potato dumpling style pasta, it's hand-rolled and always cooked to perfection here. Each bite is a bite of heaven. Having had it on my first visit (and it's one of their specialties), each time I come here, I struggle to avoid ordering it, so I can try something new.  There are two forms it comes in: \"della casa\", which is basically just the dumplings with sauce, or \"alla boscaiola\", which comes with mushrooms, (amazing) Italian sausage, and truffle oil.  Both are good, but the extra mushrooms and sausage push the second one slightly ahead in my preferences.\n\nMy wife similarly struggles with the braised pork ribs. They are so good, she can't order anything else.They are incredibly tender and seasoned perfectly, and it all just melts in your mouth. This comes with a polenta to die for!\n\nThe rigatoni is really excellent as well. I recommend you get this their meatballs, which are really tender and tasty. Absolutely delicious!\n\nThe fish specials are always fresh and cooked to perfection. We've had some really amazing scallops here, and scallops are very hard to do well. A poorly executed scallop will leave you never wanting them again. A properly cooked one will melt in your mouth and you will be in love! This place has the latter of the two.\n\nVega has my favorite Panna Cotta for dessert, of anywhere. It's creamy and delicious.  I have also tried the ice cream with espresso poured over it, and that's really good too. My wife says that the Tiramisu is priceless. They don't always have it on the menu, ask for it. It's the best one she has ever had, and she tries it in every high-end italian restaurant we go to. I concur.\n\nApparently, they are known for their pizza! The pizzas I have seen other people eating in here look really good, but the other food on the menu is so good, and I don't live nearby, there's a very good chance I will never get around to trying the pizza.\n\nAs a final note, Vega's husband has opened a restaurant across the street.  We have not yet had the opportunity to try it out, but I think we will be able to expect the same quality there.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-07-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Portions are plentiful, staff are very friendly, and the owner, Giuseppe, welcomed us personally to the neighborhood with a complimentary panna cotta for dessert.

Not true neapolitan pizza, but they don't claim that either.  Hint of truffle rounded out this excellent pizza.\n\nWe can't wait to go back to try the other food, including the secondi (saw a fish entree that looked great).\n\nFinally, the Italian-focused wine list is sized right:  Not too big, but enough choices to pair with all the different types of food.  We had a Cannonau di Sardegna, and it was a good pairing with both of our dishes.  \n\nCan't wait till our next visit!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-07-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Do not miss their panna cotta - one of the best I've ever eaten."], "author": "S.

But the 6 of us were glad we made the trip.  \n\nThe food was delicious and service very attentive.  The ambiance was intimate and cozy.  Portions were very generous, not common for eateries with tasty foods.\n\nGrilled calamarie cannellini was a nice option vs. a fried one.  It was lemony, tasty and healthy.\n\nI highly recommend all homemade pasta dishes.  Gnocchi Alla Boscaiola did not disappoint.  It was very rich.  Personally I would have preferred more mushroom than sausage.  Homemade Spaghetti was the best I have had lately.  Pizza Margherita was my least favorite.  \n\nThe three desserts we had were all very good.  Panna Cotta had a  nice firm texture and yet tasted very light, and with a subtle hint of lemon.  Again, it is one of the best ones I have had in the Bay Area.  Panino Al Cioccolato and Tiramisu were both hard to resist.  \n\nIt was a wonderful dinner enjoyed by all.
