They are extremely high-priced which has always been the case and the only way to get around that was with coupons.  However, they now say that they charge you the full price for your pizza until they review your coupons and decide whether or not to give you the coupon value (or not) as a credit.  And they only take coupons that they issue even though they don't send out coupons anymore...\n\nThis may be good tasting fast food pizza, but what does it cost you? $56 for a cheese pizza and one \"special\" pizza?  The coupon value was $20 less. It's just not worth it. \n\nThis branch has nickel and dimed its loyal customers out of wanting to eat their pizza at all. What a shame. It's the poorest customer service of anywhere we order food. \n\nI grew up eating pizza at this Round Table and have ordered from there for decades, but that breeds no loyalty on their end. It's all about the money for them and not about customers. What a disgrace!

However, this is the worst Roundtable Franchise I've ever ordered from! We ordered delivery on a an early Sunday evening. We made a very simple request, sweet Polynesian sauce on the Maui Zaui and 2 sides of ranch. \n\nOur pizza was delivered to us and the delivery guy tried to argue with us that we did not order ranch and so he didn't bring any. Of course, they just forgot and they could not admit to the mistake. Additionally, we were told that they don't carry the Polynesian sauce for the Maui Zaui Pizza...really? All Roundtables have it and you don't? That's like going into a McDonald's and them telling you that they don't sell apple pie's at that location. Anyways, on top of these issues, the pizza wasn't cooked all the way through and was extremely soft.\n\nI'm not one to complain about much, especially with food, however I've had Roundtable 100 times in my life and this was by far a terrible experience.
