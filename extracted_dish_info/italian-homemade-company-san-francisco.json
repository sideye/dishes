Gnocchi with sage and butter:  The gnocchi is so soft and bouncy and plump and just the perfect way gnocchi should taste.  The butter and sage gave it a very herb and floral taste, I personally enjoyed it very much whereas my boyfriend mentioned the flowery taste was a bit too much for him although he loved the texture of the gnocchi.  Will probably get a pesto sauce next time instead of the butter sage.\n  \n*note* that's the really nice thing about this place is that you can customize your pasta how you want it and put whatever sauce on it.\n\n3.

"], "author": "Jeffrey S.", "review": "And then, as I was just walking around on Columbus and letting my appetite do the exploring, I stumbled into Italian Homemade. Even though I had actually started at a bakery for pastries, and then gone for truffles, I was still hungry for real food beyond desserts. It's an unassuming joint and looked quick, so I wandered in to the small space with a few tables, and walked up to the counter to look at the menu board and order.\n\nOver and over again I talk about how I love small, specific spots that fill a very small niche. I know it may not be en vogue to have a small menu, but I'd rather you stay in your wheelhouse and nail it, then have a super wide menu that tries too hard to please everyone.\n\nPasta is their game, and they stick to it. Pick your homemade noodle, pick your sauce, add a few bells and whistles if you like, but that's about it. Oh and something called a gnocchi roll, which looks intriguing. But they don't go out of control, and that's what I liked.\n\nI ordered tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce and only waited about 10 minutes, which they actually apologized for being too long. They were incredibly kind, especially as I had just wandered in without doing much research and wasn't sure what to expect. They smiled a lot, and made sure I felt comfortable. That goes a long way.\n\nIt's not fancy inside; the humble interior and homemade feel of things--even the signage--drives home the point that you are getting passion on the plate and not a pre-fab five course meal.\n\nThe pasta came out piping hot. I do love tagliatelle and it's served al dente (which is unexpected for a fresh pasta) but there were a few noodles that didn't get separated from each other and did cause some sticking. I'm not mad, as I like the chew of those stacks, but not everyone does. The Bolognese sauce was meaty enough to convey the carnivorous nature without weighing me down. I didn't feel like it was an overwhelming amount of food, but it's a nice, reasonable lunch.\n\nI sat there for a while as I was eating, at the bar that faces out the window onto Columbus. What a gorgeous street. What a busy, happening place. What a perfect place to slow down, and take it all in. It's so much of what I love about San Francisco--the people, the buzz, the noise, the smells, and most of all, the possibilities. I sat here and imagined coming back to this very block, time and time again. Getting chocolates, then wandering around in an infinite amount of adventures. Trying all the foods, and letting the city take us where it wants. \n\nI imagined the next time I'll be here--it may not be until next year--but what will that be like? Where will I go? Who will come with me for truffles and pastries and homemade pasta, or where will we decide to go instead? In five years, in ten years, as shops open and close, there are infinite adventures to be had. \n\nI sat and thought about all of this, and before I knew it, my tagliatelle was gone. I cleared my plate, took a deep breath, and once again opened to door back out to the street and all the opportunities that were about to present themselves once again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-06-19"}, {"excerpts": ["So far I've tried the meat ravioli w/ marinara, pesto gnocchi, and the gnocchi roll w/ marinara and they were all equally amazing in their own way. \n\n"], "author": "Marny N.", "review": "OFFICIALLY THE BEST PASTA I HAVE EVER HAD.\n\nNo fancy Italian spot could possibly beat this place.

It was super enticing but we ended up across the street at that sushi place because he did not feel Italian that day. Ever since I learned that he lived, for the most part, at his other place on 7th and Clement, and had a whole other life that I was not aware of, I had declared that 7th and Clement and it's immediate vicinity to be my no-fly zone. Alas, rules like such were made to be bend. From time to time, I continue to hover there, as T lived there too, and we were often out and about, doing our usual official food business. \n\nBut I prefer North Beach more. Yet that day, I was not here with B.  I was here to meet with a girlfriend of mine. And she's going to bring her new boyfriend. As I waited, I ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich based on the waitstaff's recommendation. The sandwich was served on a thin flat bread. Super delicious. Mouth watering. And the prosciutto was fresh. \n\nI told the waitstaff that I'm sure that my friends who are coming to meet here, would order something here too. You see, she was super sweet. She served my sandwich warm. Already cut up, half in a to-go box and half on a plate. A fast food with superb service. So considerate.\n\nThe girlfriend arrived with her new beau in tow. He was very intrigued about everything that was being served around us. A man arrived later than they, had gone up to the counter to order a gnocchi roll. I recall the waitstaff telling me that was good too but it sounded so unusual at the time. We watched the gnocchi roll being served to that man who ordered it.  The gnocchi roll looked like lasagna.

We had the Piata sandwich and the gnocchi roll, which is gnocchi dough rolled out and filled with spinach and ricotta. They were both delicious. For the good and a large San Peligrino, the tab was $30.

The servers and staff were dressed up for Christmas. I don't like overpaying for pasta but these were perfect portions for one person and you could get a couple to share with friends easily. Get here before 11:45am to avoid the lunch rush and to grab a seat.

"], "author": "Ahmad J.", "review": "Italian Homemade Company popped up as the first restaurant when searching for Italian food in Russian Hill. It seemed to have good reviews and had an online ordering app on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. The menu is your standard Italian fare with salads, sandwiches, pasta, lasagna etc. I generally avoid getting pasta to-go as it gets soggy and lumpy by the time you get home, so after going through the menu I decided to get the Meatballs with Piadina Flatbread ($11). I honestly did not know what \"Piadina\" was, but went with it keeping an open mind.\n\nI reached the restaurant (It's on Columbus just ahead of Washington Square) 20 minutes after ordering to find that my food was ready so I was on my way. I got a heavy container with the meatballs along with the flatbread that was neatly wrapped in a silver foil. There were 6 huge meatballs. I mean these were gigantic. Unfortunately they were frozen solid. The plastic fork broke into pieces without even making a dent in these. The meatballs had to have been taken out of a freezer and used without thawing them out first. I am not sure what these folks were thinking when they gave me frozen meatballs. Would I not notice? Would they thaw out on the way home? Well, No & No. I let them stand for an hour hoping that they would thaw out. What these needed was about 3-4 minutes in a microwave, as I did not have one, I could not do much except to safely confine them in the trash. The flatbread was thin with a light dusting of raw flour. It was not built to soak up the sauce that came with the meatballs but could be used like a spoon to scoop up the sauce to quench my hunger.\n \nPrice wise this dish was cheap for the location. Most of the pastas on the menu are around the $15 mark which is also a little less when compared to other Italian places in the area. There are a ton of Italian restaurants to try in the area so I have no intention of returning here after this experience.", "rating": 1, "date": "2017-07-17"}]}
