I ordered combo beef pho and fish sauce fried chicken wings. \n\nSigh....this is probably more of a hit or miss in good Vietnamese food. I miss my friends' parents' home cooking and my original hometown. \n\nBeef bone broth tastes like water with some flavor, even with the added sauce, lime, jalape\u00f1o, Vietnamese basil/perilla, etc. it tasted like diluted beef broth. Not even sure it was bone broth at all.\n\nPro: lots of meat and noodles\nCon: broth was very light in flavor, had 1 tripe and 1 beef tendon. 1 of each only! So sad. \n\nChicken wings tasted like normal fried chicken wings. Where's the fish sauce? Oh well for normal fried wings, it's good. At least the sticky rice with fried garlic and mixed greens with it were yummy. Anything with sweet Thai chili sauce from the bottle is always good.

This used to be a Chinese grocery store for the longest time. They've done a fantastic job renovating the pace.  The ambience is very nice and you could definitely come here for a date or dinner with friends. They have 2 big booths and a large side booth seat with multiple tables across in addition to chairs which seat couples or can be combined to accommodate 10+ people.\n\nThere is a 60 inch plasma screen TV and they're very nice about putting on the game if you ask. As soon as we were seated (without a wait on 6 pm on a Saturday) they brought us hot tea and water. The menu is very extensive with your traditional Vietnamese pho and vermicelli bowls,  in addition to appetizers. \n\nWe got the chicken spring rolls as an appetizer.  The peanut sauce was really good and you get 4 large rolls,  so it is definitely worth the $6.95. For the main course ee gotwonton soup with extra noodles and the chicken Vermicelli bowl.   With the Vermicelli,  It comes with an egg roll and i didn't realize it had pork in it,  so be sure to ask for a vegetarian before hand. The wonton soup is humongous. Honestly,  it could easily feed 3 people.  It was pretty good too. If you're hungry,  you can't go wrong. \n\nSo,  overall,  this place is pretty good and the prices are decent,  but i wasn't blown away.  I will probably come back again,  but it's more of a \"safe\" option, as opposed to a place I'll be dying to come back to.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-03-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The noodles were separate and there wasn't really enough space in the broth container so an extra bowl from your kitchen is required. \n", "They were super tasty and the sticky rice was a great ending.
