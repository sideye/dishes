I dined at the new Henry's Hunan on Grant Street for the first time last night.  I give it 9.7 Kearnys out of 10!

You're probably getting the idea that I liked it.  Not only was the food the best Hunan cuisine I've had in a long time (and compared with some pretty fine food at other places), but the restaurant is really nicely appointed, and located on a really cute little section of Grant Ave.  It is North Beach, not Chinatown, but if you are looking for a fun place to walk around before and after dinner - or a real authentic old San Francisco atmosphere for your tourist friends, take them here.
