No reservations.   \n\nKaisen Don's specialty is chirashi with about 10 variations. For those squeamish about raw fish, they have dons with cooked proteins: chicken teriyaki, unagi, chashu, and beef curry. Each order comes with a complimentary bowl of miso soup. Currently, they don't have a liquor license. \n\nIf you see a particular item on their Yelp page that you want, call before visiting. I saw a pic of the shaved ankimo but they didn't have it and the girl at the table in back of me wanted negitoro but they didn't have that either. \n\nNote to the owner, there's a small discrepancy on your Yelp page.

Like another yelper mentioned, the rice has too much vinegar and the rice to fish ratio was poor. I know quality fresh seafood is pricey, and I expected that, but overall I can't say that the meal was memorable. I've definitely had more enjoyable chirashi dons at other places for better pricing and quality. \n\nUnfortunately, there was a very strong fish odor when you walk into the restaurant.

The pieces of fish are of good size but some pieces were oddly sliced. The fish was good, but something was missing as the texture was non-existent.

I ordered the Kaisen Don #1, but at full price, I would not. Its about $19 for the bowl. At that price, I'm expecting an extra slice of salmon or 2 and one more sweet shrimp. Also leave the lemon out, it just doesn't go with the bowl.\n\nAs for the taste, its alright, but not worth $19-alright. The rice was plain, where's the seasoning/rice vinegar? Hello? I mean it's just rice but the rice vinegar makes a big difference especially when paired with raw fish. \n\nAlso, get rid of the lemon, the lemon rubs onto the fish and partially masks the freshness the taste/freshness of the fish. Unless you're using shitty fish, get rid of the shitty lemon. Once you use rice vinegar, the lemon will be too overbearing anyways. Or put it to the side if you insist putting lemon in the bowl.\n\nAnother, the thickness of the cut of the fish. The salmon were basically in blocks in my don (there's much photographic proof that this is so on this yelp page). Just look at the photos, they're goddamn 2-match-box-combined sized chunks.\nThe reason why a lot of chirashi places have thinner slices is so people can easily wrap their fish around their rice and dip it in sauce. But instead, you have a block of salmon which you eat separately from the rice. \n\nThe radish. \nThe goddamn pile of #radish.\nSure it makes it instagrammable or whatever, but nobody eats that much radish with chirashi. If you insist on leaving that much radish then at least place it over a leaf/seaweed/lettuce so people can pull out all the radish in one fell swoop instead of picking at it to remove it.\n\nJust from these small but important details you can tell these guys were just like \"Oh hey let's just open a Chirashi place because it's easy to make the food and it's popular\" without much regard on how Chirashi is supposed to be made.\n\nOne more thing to pick at: \"bringing Tsukiji's food CULTURE\". So is the fish from Tsukiji or are you guys only talking about the food culture in which they have fresh fish everyday? Because this place is literally just fish over rice and not how chirashi actually is.\n\nI think this place can be a lot better. I think SF needs more chirashi places like this one BUT BETTER.

When I heard that there's a new place that specializes Chirashi, I was super excited.  \n\nAt a glance, the place is small, looks modern, somewhat resembles bubble tea/fast food restaurant.  Dinning room seats small amount of guests, this is probably due to SF regulations.  Things looks very clean and sterile.  When I walked it, around 5:40pm, it wasn't so busy, but I realized there was a line outside the door about 15 minutes after i sat down.  \n\nI was brought a menu with very nice pictures.  Not too much choices as a regular Japanese restaurant, but enough choices.  There are the scallop lover, Hamachi love, blue blue fin tuna, and even uni or toro.

You can get the same less than 20 plus a 20% yelp discount - that is a deal.\n\nI brought my family there, my wife and two kids.  We ordered a box of uni for appetizer.  My wife ordered the Rainbow bowl, and I ordered the hamachi bowl.  I ordered the thin slice beef bowl for my kids to share.  The bowls came up rather quickly, but not all at once.  They were well presented.  The chef did really take a lot of time making sure the bowls presentable.  The fish are very fresh and high quality.  I enjoyed every bite of my Kaisen Don.  \n\nWhile I was there, I was able to located the owner, Larry.  While the places wasn't too busy, he told me about where he learned how to make chirashi bowls.  He basically like me who love chirashi.  He also recommended me to mix and match your chirashi bowls, and don't have to pick from the menu.\n\nI did read Chris' review, and I appreciate him pointing out how Larry's chirashi isn't the perfect chirashi for him.  Perhaps Larry can learn something from his review.  For me, I am pretty satisfy with mine, or Larry's representation.  I feel that if everyone's chirashi is exactly the same, there won't be any innovation in food.  We will eat the same thing for hundreds of years, but perhaps someone like Chris will enjoy that, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Larry is certainly someone who will probably take advice from his toughest critics.  If not, how else would you make your customers happy.  5 stars for my experience.

The concept of this place is not bad since they are mainly serving the fresh fish/bowls or hot bowls such as unagi don, salmon ochazuke don, gyu don and etc. If you like chirashi- I recommend coming here!

Came here for a later lunch on a Saturday (1pm-ish).\n\nVenue / Service: on the smaller side, the biggest table probably seats 4 people and fits probably no more than 20 people.  B/c the kitchen is small, food does take a bit on the longer side, but not long enough that you start to get impatient.\n\nFood: in general, the donburis are well portioned, in fact larger than I've seen at most places.  Enough protein vs. rice and bowl sizes are good enough to fill the stomach of a hungry guy.\n-- Santa Barbara Uni / Half Tray (~$30) - came here mainly for this since we love uni.  A half tray is around 5 pieces, which are placed on slices of cucumber and served with wasabi and pieces of nori.  We basically placed pieces of uni in the nori with a bit of wasabi, which I think was the best way to enjoy the taste cleanly.  Uni was pretty fresh and sweet (being from Santa Barbara); definitely worth the trip for!\n\n-- Gyu Don (thin beef, onion, tamago)($12.95) - to supplement the uni, I ordered one of these.  The tamago was tasty, even if it looked more like cheese.  The beef was nice and tender and they give you a decent amount vs. rice.  Wish there were more veggies / onions, but the taste was pretty good.\n\nMy date had the Unagi Don (BBQ eel, seaweed, pickle)($15.95), which was also quite tasty.  A bit too much of the sauce on it, but the eel was nicely cooked and was a pretty big piece.\n\nAll in all, we weren't disappointed after driving out of SF just to try their uni and the donburis.  Price was a bit high, but I think my date and I would make a trip out again here.", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-02-14"}, {"excerpts": ["Scallop Lover don: scallop sashimi with Ikura \nUnagi don: unagi with sauce over rice\n\n"], "author": "Miffy Y.", "review": "I think I found this place through yelp's new businesses and then followed up with looking through pictures of their amazing donburis. Four stars for their creativity and simplicity in opening a place that only serves donburis. Don't expect anything more but don't expect anything less either.\n\nA \"don\" is short for Donburi which is basically meat and rice in Japanese food language. They offer around 15 different dons - ranging from the Omakase don to cooked items like Teriyaki Chicken don. \n\nFor three girls, we ordered:\nOmakase don - features a range of different sashimi at two to three pieces each: uni, hamachi, tamago, salmon, toro, tuna. \nRainbow don: another mix of sashimi, very similar to the omakase don\nScallop Lover don: scallop sashimi with Ikura \nUnagi don: unagi with sauce over rice\n\nWe came in on a Saturday night, 630pm for three, about a 20 min wait. Their fish overall is fresh, better end of Japanese restaurants. They give you enough fish a lot of rice and ikura. We ended up taking the seaweed pieces they gave us to make Ikura nigiris. \n\nThey are still in their soft opening phase. Very apparent with their furnishing and this place is small. Imagine a newly painted apartment living room with open kitchen split in half for you to only dine in the living room portion. Would not recommend a party of more than four. Not cozy at all, pretty bare but comfortable enough for dinner. \n\nOverall, I would return because I do want to try their Uni special which is only available Tues-Thurs.
