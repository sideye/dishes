Perhaps because it's conveniently located on the outside of the stylish Stonestown Galleria where you can dine and shop at the same time! What's not to love? \n\nThe real reason my family and I always go is because of the \"Buy One Take One\" Deal that always seems to come around every four months or so. I can honestly tell you the deal is so worth it. In fact, it really is the only reason to go to \"The OG\" as I call it. Look the place isn't perfect, It's large, loud, service is decent if somewhat lacking because they're always so busy, and the food is well at its Olive Garden best.\n\nI only go to the OG when there is a \"Buy One Take One\" deal because not only is it a ton of food to eat while you are there, but you get to take a full dish home. You start with the all you can eat soup and salad with a side of breadsticks. Then you pick between four pasta dishes or three meat and/or shrimp dishes for an additional sum.\n\nBut since this meal deal also comes with the all you can eat soup and salad, you know what I plan on feasting on while I'm actually dining at the OG. First off my top priority is to enjoy all the soup and salad and breadsticks you can, and have a few bites of your pasta that your dinner plan actually consists of, and then get a to go box to take that one home on top of the one you order to take home. That's what I did and I'm not ashamed! \n\nI start off with the Zuppa Toscana soup which is a wonderful creamy hearty soup with plenty of sausage, kale and potatoes. And then I move onto the Minestrone which is decent if not remarkable, and then I finish with the Chicken & Gnocchi soup which is so hearty I don't have any room for anything else. It helps that my fellow diners get salad because they don't like soup, so I happily sponged off a few bites of their all-you-can eat salad. Clearly I have no shame!\n\nI found the pastas the OG is offering BOGO taste decent, but not great. Sauce was lacking on my Cavatappi with Asiago Garlic Alfredo, and the newest pastas they offer with this meal deal, the Penne with Basil Garlic Marinara tasted rather unremarkable. I also remembered to sign up for the Olive Garden Eclub, in which you get emailed a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. (Which our server had to ask his manager if it was allowed with the Buy One Take One Meal Deal, thankfully it was!) So we started with the trio sample appetizer with fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and toasted ravioli. They were okay, but nothing I would order on their own. \n\nAt the end of our meal despite being stuffed, we decided to try a dessert. We agreed on the Zeppoli, which are the Italian doughnuts. To my amazement, the doughnuts tasted delicious. They were light and sugary and perfect when paired with the chocolate dipping sauce. It was the perfect end to an overstuffed meal.\n\nOlive Garden is not like eating in Rome or even San Francisco's North Beach, and it's no were near the quality or overall deal that Maggiano's has to offer. But it's a decent place with affordable prices that does tend to get really crowded on weekends for dinner. But that's what still makes the place so amazing: the fact that people still enjoy this place after so many years.

The breadsticks, unlimited salad, and soup was what drew us here, and all that was delicious! Everything else though was disappointing and the night went downhill from here. \n\nService was either MIA or fleeting.  Our table didn't even have utensils. Server didn't notice, neither did the host. We were served our salad and soup but couldn't enjoy anything until we had to flag a staff member down. Would've told our server, but she wasn't around! She barely came by to check on us, also forgot about our appetizer until we asked her about it, and that was 10 mins after when we were already finished the salad, soup, and breadsticks. So everything was really slow. I could tell she was stressed. \n\nThe appetizers and entrees lacked flavor or had TOO MUCH seasoning. We ordered a three sampler appetizer - stuffed mushrooms, fried mozzarella, and parmesan crusted zucchini. Zucchini had too much salt, didn't finish. Stuffed mushrooms were meh. Didn't finish either. Best appetizer of the three was the fried mozzarella. As for the entrees, my bf ordered a create your own -- grilled chicken, angel hair pasta, and asiago garlic alfredo sauce. I ordered a shrimp scampi. My bf's create your own pasta was dull and did not have enough sauce. His angel hair pasta was dry af. The grilled chicken was good, but he couldn't finish the pasta. My shrimp scampi was meh. Compared to my bf's, the shrimp scampi had too much sauce to the point the noodles were soggy. I was disappointed because the presentation definitely did not look like their advertised photo on the menu. There were more than 3 shrimps though! I ate it but probably should've ordered something else on the menu.\n\nIt's been years since I've eaten at Olive Garden and this recent experience delays me from wanting to come back.

Perhaps because it's conveniently located on the outside of the stylish Stonestown Galleria where you can dine and shop at the same time! What's not to love? \n\nThe real reason my family and I always go is because of the \"Buy One Take One\" Deal that always seems to come around every four months or so. I can honestly tell you the deal is so worth it. In fact, it really is the only reason to go to \"The OG\" as I call it. Look the place isn't perfect, It's large, loud, service is decent if somewhat lacking because they're always so busy, and the food is well at its Olive Garden best.\n\nI only go to the OG when there is a \"Buy One Take One\" deal because not only is it a ton of food to eat while you are there, but you get to take a full dish home. You start with the all you can eat soup and salad with a side of breadsticks. Then you pick between four pasta dishes or three meat and/or shrimp dishes for an additional sum.\n\nBut since this meal deal also comes with the all you can eat soup and salad, you know what I plan on feasting on while I'm actually dining at the OG. First off my top priority is to enjoy all the soup and salad and breadsticks you can, and have a few bites of your pasta that your dinner plan actually consists of, and then get a to go box to take that one home on top of the one you order to take home. That's what I did and I'm not ashamed! \n\nI start off with the Zuppa Toscana soup which is a wonderful creamy hearty soup with plenty of sausage, kale and potatoes. And then I move onto the Minestrone which is decent if not remarkable, and then I finish with the Chicken & Gnocchi soup which is so hearty I don't have any room for anything else. It helps that my fellow diners get salad because they don't like soup, so I happily sponged off a few bites of their all-you-can eat salad. Clearly I have no shame!\n\nI found the pastas the OG is offering BOGO taste decent, but not great. Sauce was lacking on my Cavatappi with Asiago Garlic Alfredo, and the newest pastas they offer with this meal deal, the Penne with Basil Garlic Marinara tasted rather unremarkable. I also remembered to sign up for the Olive Garden Eclub, in which you get emailed a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. (Which our server had to ask his manager if it was allowed with the Buy One Take One Meal Deal, thankfully it was!) So we started with the trio sample appetizer with fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and toasted ravioli. They were okay, but nothing I would order on their own. \n\nAt the end of our meal despite being stuffed, we decided to try a dessert. We agreed on the Zeppoli, which are the Italian doughnuts. To my amazement, the doughnuts tasted delicious. They were light and sugary and perfect when paired with the chocolate dipping sauce. It was the perfect end to an overstuffed meal.\n\nOlive Garden is not like eating in Rome or even San Francisco's North Beach, and it's no were near the quality or overall deal that Maggiano's has to offer. But it's a decent place with affordable prices that does tend to get really crowded on weekends for dinner.

You can reserve a dining room if you plan to eat with a big group. The food is alright. \nYes, there is usually a ridiculously long line that makes me question some people's priorities. But then I remember why there's a wait. A lot of people shop at Stonestown with their friends and families. All of whom roll up in their extra large vans, minivans, SUVs, tour busses, what have you, and they all seem to want to eat in a sit-down restaurant with waiter service, because the food court just won't cut it. A lot of the younger crowd from several neighboring schools have appetites and time to spare. Then there are the out-of-towners who don't have an Olive Garden in their local neighborhood. I'm assuming most of them arrived just after watching a hunger-inducing Olive Garden commercial.\n \nSo you see, there's no reason to get mad at Olive Garden for having a long wait time. Well, sometimes I do notice that they quote an insane 45min -1hr estimate when there are empty tables. I don't know what's up with that. Poor communication? *Shrugs* I don't know.\n\nThe menu offers the usual Italian dishes - pastas & pizzas, and other typical mainstream dishes that chain restaurants offer. What do you expect?

You can't expect a fine dining experience.\n\nYes, service is hit or miss.  Most of the wait staff are young and are students from nearby SF State.  \n\nFood is mass produced.  You're supposed to get as much tossed green salad or soup as you'd like with your entree, but again, it depends on the server.  Also comes with as much as garlic bread sticks as you'd like.\n\nThe tossed green salad consists of iceberg lettuce thrown in with a few slices of tomatoes, bermuda onions and a few olives with Italian dressing.  Very boring.\n\nGo for the soup.  My favorite is the Zuppa Toscana.  Ingredients include Italian sausage, potatoes, and kale.  Again depending on who scoops the soup, you can get lots of potatoes with no kale or vice versa.\n\nBest deal is the all you can eat soup & salad for $6.95.

The eggplant is breaded so last time it was crispy where as this time, it was as little soggy. I also had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert valued at $10. Got the Sampler and just paid the difference. The sampler consists of calamari and stuffed mushrooms. I usually HATE mushrooms but I have always been a huge fan of their stuffed mushrooms. There's a lot of cheese - well it looks like a lot of cheese ... but it goes perfectly with the mushroom. Sister ate the Fettuccine Alfredo as usual and mother had the Steak Toscano.

"], "author": "Nina M.", "review": "I go to Olive Garden now and then, once in a few months maybe longer.  However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.

I tried three of the sauce... The chianti three meat, creamy parmesan portobello, and the five cheese marinara. The five cheese marinara was my least favorite out of the three I tried.

The creamy parmesan protobello was amazing, it reminds me of alfredo sauce, but you really do get the portobello mushroom taste in the sauce.

No offense to any of you all here but I hate the people that go into these fast food joints or chain restaurants and bash them for having lackluster food or not providing that five-star, six diamond Zagat-rated, hullabaloo. For me, I know what I'm going into. If I'm going to a place that has cute candle-lit dinners and a bit more pricey plates, I expect it as long as they are attentive but leave me alone a little bit with the good company and fantastic food. When I go to McDonald's, I expect the food to be made quick, taste the same as when I had it last time, and be in and out by someone that knows what I'm ordering, what I ordered, and how to swipe my card. I don't confuse these two scenarios. It's why I don't mind giving bad reviews to that candle-lit restaurant when I feel like I'm at McDonald's or giving a five star review to a McDonald's that treats me like I'm at a fabulous place.\n\nThe Olive Garden at Stonestown, however, really sucks. I used to come here a lot when I was in high school just because it was close by, I love (American) Italian, and it was consistent. I knew what I wanted, I knew it'd be good, and I knew what to expect. My favorites used to be the fettuccine alfredo with some chicken, one bowl too many of the zuppa toscana, and mountains of bread sticks. The price would be good, the family (or friends) would be content, and the service would be just right and attentive.

Being the type of person who feels compelled to eat everything I'm given, I was still eating the salad (hadn't gotten to the breadsticks yet) when my entr\u00e9e was brought out. Now, I recalled that Starboard Value released a famous PowerPoint presentation that led to Olive Garden's parent company replacing its entire board of directors. In the presentation, they argued that the default portion sizes for the salad and breadsticks were too large, leading to food waste. They recommended that servers bring out a breadstick for each person at the table plus one additional breadstick. This rule was not followed, since I was given three breadsticks instead of two. I agree that this felt like an enormous amount of food before I even got to my entr\u00e9e.\n\nI searched \"Olive Garden\" on Google News to see how their business is doing since it seemed that they had not made all the recommended changes. I learned that an Olive Garden restaurant in New York is charging $400 for dinner tonight because they have a view of the New Year's Eve ball on Times Square. Well, I got lunch on New Year's Eve for about $15 including tip at this restaurant in suburban California.\n\nThe sandwich I ordered is interesting. It's chicken parmigiana, which is basically breaded chicken breast, served sandwiched inside a wider-than-standard breadstick. It comes with a side of fries. It almost looks like fries and a hot dog when you look at it. I'm not sure I really needed the fries after eating an enormous amount of salad and three breadsticks, and I'm not sure I really needed the sandwich bread after eating three breadsticks. If I go back, I will probably order a more traditional menu item.\n\nOne thing that was kind of peculiar is that there was a tablet-like device at my table for ordering food. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use it to order or if I was going to have a waiter. I was trying to figure out how to order a Dr. Pepper when a waitress came to take my order. A little bit awkward :). The only thing we ended up using it for was for the waitress to run my credit card at the end. She stood there while I picked how much to tip using the device after it presented me with a default, which was also a little awkward.\n\nOverall, I think the food is a good value here, especially for lunch. Unfortunately, I don't go to Olive Garden very often because between the salad, breadsticks, and entr\u00e9e, even without an appetizer, if you eat here often, you will probably get very fat.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-12-31"}], "spicy calabrian chicken breadstick sandwich": [], "lasagna classico": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the tour of Italy which consist of a chicken parmigiana, lasagna classico and their signature fettuccine alfredo for $22.99.

Olive Garden is more of a walk-in restaurant so no reservations. They have a nice seating area for maybe about 10 people to sit.\n\nService: When we got seated, our waiter was very friendly. He has the voice of an announcer which was pretty cool. He came by asking if we wanted to start off with drinks or appetizers (standard procedure at any restaurant) and he came back to check in if we were ready to order. During our meals, he would check in if we needed anything else and if we were satisfied with our food. Overall: service was great.\n\nFood: Breadsticks were good. I honestly don't see what the rave is about. I eat a lot of bread and this just wasn't to die for IMO. Probably because I had high expectations and it just didn't meet it. The salad was standard. Didn't expect much but they did give a big bowl of it.\n\nI got the Strawberry-Passion Fruit Limonata $3.50 and I really liked it. It might be a little too sweet for others but I think it was just perfect for me. It was a nice blend of strawberry and limonade.\n\nWe ordered an Italiano Sampler $12.99 for 3 choices. We got Calamari, Fried Mozzarella, and Toasted beef and pork ravioli. When we got our appetizer, it was not what we ordered. When I told our waiter, he went to check and brought out what we actually ordered. He asked if we wanted to keep or not. I bargained that if it was free, we'll keep it and he said sure! Awesome free apps! I loved the calamari and the ravioli. Really nice frying.\n\nFor my main entree, I got the Tour of Italy $17.99 which comes with Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna Classico and our signature Fettuccine Alfredo. This dish was great because I got to try a couple of items rather than just one. The Alfredo was good. The fettuccine was still a little hard but the alfredo was tasty.

When asked what she wanted to eat for dinner she responds with \"Olive Garden\" only I think it was a ruse because she wanted me to go to Sephora with her...lol! \n\nThe Olive Garden we chose is in the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall which is a hop and a skip around the corner from SFSU. So the fact that it was located in a mall means ample parking. We arrived at about 4:30 and didn't take too long to find parking, within decent walking distance of the front door of the restaurant. \n\nFor a party of 8, Olive Garden gave me an estimated wait time of 20 minutes, not too shabby, especially for dinner time on a Saturday. Although I think there wasn't much of a wait because everyone seemed to be next door at Marugame Udon and maybe part of it has to do with the reason I could only muster 2 stars for this review.  Marugame Udon had the line snaked in front and then even had to split it into two because of how long the line was. I of course made a mental note that will need to try it next time. It was like that when we left Olive Garden and when we finally left the mall at 8PM.\n\nSo the hostess at Olive Garden was pleasant and didn't ask how to spell my name (America), you have no idea how many people ask. Our party was then called and we were escorted to the back in what seemed to be a more private room. Come to find out it's where they stick the families with the crying babies...lol! Didn't bother us too much because we are kind of a loud speaking family so we may have had the crying babies beat by a few octaves. \n\nOur server was prompt with our bread and took our drink orders. While everyone ordered their arnold palmer's and water, I also ordered their special: Blackberry Watermelon Margarita. When it came, it tasted like Minute Maid juice slushy in a salt rimmed glass, not even a hint of alcohol. Bleh and disappointing! She brought us our drinks and then took our appetizer and dinner orders. The appetizers came (fried mozzerella and calamari) and when I asked her to take the wine glasses on the table as we would not be ordering any wine, she forgot to take them when she set our appetizers down. The table was kind of small for our party of 8 and I was trying to make good use of the room we had and remove any superfluous items i.e them wine glasses! I hadn't realize how small the portion size was for the appetizers and we only ordered 2 because it's all that tempted us. Only our waitress did not come back until she had our dinner's ready but I put in another order of calamari anyway since my mom enjoyed it. \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp and chicken carbonara's, a pasta chips nachos, 2 shrimp scampi, spaghetti, shrimp alfredo and salmon with broccoli. My husband tends to gauge all his meals against my cooking and he was NOT happy with his shrimp and chicken carbonara. He had me taste it and the chicken had a weird texture to it as if it had been previously frozen after being lightly breaded (almost the same consistency of a McDonald's chicken nugget if you take the breading off) and the shrimp was gummy. My salmon and broccoli were delicious. My son ordered the shrimp scampi and was unimpressed because the asparagus that came in the dish was raw and hard. My mother's boyfriend ordered the pasta chips nachos and he said he was a fan. The chips seemed to be a fried won ton consistency and held up against the meat mixture they topped it with. \n\nOur bill came out to be $230 and I would not have flinched at that price had we had a more attentive waitress and the quality of food was better. I know it's Olive Garden and not some world renowned Italian restaurant but come on, people work hard for their money and make contingencies to enjoy a meal away from home. This was not our first time here and my mom was just here for Mother's Day with my sister and brother and she said the service and food was the same then, but she wanted to give it another try. I don't give 2 star reviews, I really try to give establishments the benefit of the doubt because I get there are off days. I unfortunately could not take that approach this time and I think it should be duly noted that Olive Garden you are a pretty well known restaurant and there has to be some sort of second look of your quality control standards and maybe someone should watch to see how often your servers are checking in on the patrons. When I spend money and take the time to travel and decide on where I want to spend my hard earned money I want it to be at a place that takes pride in their name and food and are attentive to my needs.", "rating": 2, "date": "2018-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered grilled chicken parmagiana with spaghetti.

I feel he should have asked if we were of age then ask for the sample. I don't understand that train of questions that he chose with the wine.....anyways, the wine was nasty! I've had better wine  elsewhere. The wine was very very warm and I just didn't like how it tasted. \n\nMy friend and I came because I wanted to try the special three course dinner for $13, but apparently that promotion ended. We chose the dinner for two special for $25 instead. The deal comes with EITHER appetizer OR dessert, and the choice of two entrees including the unlimited soup or salad and breadsticks. My friend and I chose the garlic chicken and the shrimp visuvio. I would say the chicken Alfredo was the best dish of the night. The chicken was the best part! The noodles...we're good but I felt the cream sauce was a little on the salty side. The shrimp visuvio was alright, nothing special.  You get a lot of little shrimps which was not too bad. The pasta noodles were a mystery though, they were like regular spaghetti noodles with striations on them. They were a little strange to me.....and the waiter said the shrimp dish was spicy, which I was excited to hear because I love spicy food. When I ate though, I was not feeling any sweat at all. Very disappointing. \n\nOnto the dessert now. I had asked the waiter what the triple chocolate strata was and he did not know so he went to the back to ask. He came back with the description of a cake that can be bought anywhere! A chocolate cake with frosting? Really? Can you not at least sell the product? When I see triple chocolate, I want to hear that it's made with fudge or with dark chocolate mixed with a German chocolate filling or something! Not just a chocolate cake with frosting.....my friend and I went with the tiramisu after hearing that lame excuse of a triple chocolate cake. BAD CHOICE. The tiramisu was probably a frozen cake from Costco cut into a 3x3 cake. It was not rock hard but it was pretty icy when my friend and I ate it. I would have preferred to just get it from Costco if I knew I was going to be eating Costco tiramisu. \n\nI was overall, not satisfied at all with my visit. I guess once its Olive Garden, I shouldn't expect much since its a chain but is till expected something better.

We were seated in a nice booth and I advised the hostess that it was my mom's birthday and if she could alert the server.   \n\nOur server greeted us and said Happy Birthday to my mother, teased her about being 21 - she was humored (she's 81)...he was very nice.  We started with the Fonduta appetizer- which was YUMMY-- melted cheese blend (fondue) to spread on little slices of assorted bread.  Very, very good!   My husband had the garden salad and my mom and I both tried different soups- she had the chicken gnocchi soup and I had the potato soup- both very good.  The potato soup had a kick- but very good.\n\nFor our entrees- I couldn't decide, so I got the Taste of Italy- a small portion of chicken parmigiana, fettuccine Alfredo and lasagna.  I ate bits of all of it- think I liked the chicken best.  The leftovers will come in handy for lunch tomorrow.    But it was all very good.  Hubby had the mixed grill- skewers of chicken, beef and veggies- pretty much cleaned his plate.  Mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs- well it came as spaghetti and meat sauce.  We advised the server (who was not the one who took the order) and they brought out a side of meatballs very quickly.   Mom is a small eater, she said it was very good and now has 2-3 more meals from the leftovers. \n\nWe were asked if we wanted to order dessert- which we said yes and I purposely spoke loudly around the server to my mom- saying \"you want a scoop of ice cream on your birthday don't you?\"- again trying to remind the server that we had a birthday.   We ordered our desserts and they were delivered- without any birthday celebration...perhaps they don't do that there?  I don't know.   I would have expected a candle in her ice cream at the very least.\n\nThe Black Tie Mousse-cake was delicious, hubby had the lemon cream cake and that was also very good.

It is just Olive Garden... come on... don't hate so much... don't tell me you went in thinking it was going to be a trip back to Italy... of course not... it is a chain and as such... you need to rate it as such.  Not in comparison to a fine authentic Italian Ristorante.  \n\nSo, that said... this is a review for the Chain known as Olive Garden.  We all have moments where we just are plain hungry and if you happen to be at the mall... hey, you just might stroll in.  Yes, the wait is ridiculous at times, but they don't hold a gun to you to stay... there is always the other chain across the way. :)\n\nLet's see... the one thing you will find at this place is that since everything is pretty much done cookie cut... you will pretty much always get the same thing... it is consistent... unless someone dropped a salt shaker in the pot or something.  \n\nWhat do I like getting here... well, I am a simple gal... and one dish I enjoy here is the capellini pomodoro... simple angel hair pasta with lots of tomatoes.... can't go wrong with that... on a good day I will order chicken with it... they charge you a little extra... but no biggie.  then there are those bread sticks that are made with some crack on top because I am telling ya... you have one... and next thing you know... you had about 4!  Yeah... I am pretty sure it is some form of crack... then you have the salad... I like their dressing... a little on the salty end... so, I can't have too much before I feel like I need to swallow a gallon of water, but that is ok... I have plenty of refills on my ice tea... which I do not sweeten... I never do... their tea is pretty good... doesn't have the over brewed flavor that some other places tend to have.  So, again... I do not complain.  \n\nAnd after shopping all day... I will actually contemplate ordering an appetizer.  You ca never go wrong with the stuffed mushrooms... hey... they are cheesy!  And also... they have a Mozzarella Fondue of sorts with bread... yummy... cheesy, cheesy!  \n\nSo... that is about it... this place is what it is... and for the amount of food my friends and I manage to eat and take in to-go containers... it is not a bad deal... \n\nSo, if you are looking for a romantic Italian Restaurant to propose to someone at... of course this in NOT the place... but if for some reason you think it is... hey... nothing wrong with that... you do your thing... remember... at the Olive Garden... we are all Famiglia!\n\nMinus 1 star is for the service.... very hit or miss... you can be left out there in the cold for quite some time... bring your own bottled water to save you from getting the Heimlick Maneuver done while eating your food with my drink to wash it down... hey... you never know... you might save someones life!", "rating": 3, "date": "2008-10-14"}, {"excerpts": ["When I went there with my brother last Wednesday, I ordered the parmesan crusted talapia which was pretty decent; my main complaint would be that the amount of angel hair pasta they gave me was a joke.

I share the same default reaction to roll my eyes at chain restaurants as other \"sophisticated\" diners in this great city.   \n\nI went to Olive Garden, however, before I became a food snob and knew about the local versus chain distinction.  And I'll be honest:  I had a lot of good times here, as it is the only one in the city.  I have come here during very different stages of life, and I can appreciate it in a different light now, in the sense that it is family and kid-friendly(has changing station in restroom, kid's menu, etc.).\n\nI won't bother comparing this to \"authentic\" Italian cuisine since I have been to many Italian restaurants but never one in Italy.  I think I know what Italian food tastes like.  But here's what you'll get when you come here:  a wait, nice ambiance, pretty good service, tasty food, a full stomach, and an above average price for the check.\n\nWaiting:  They don't take reservations, so if you are coming on a weekend, either come really early(and still have to hang out nearby for 20 or so minutes), or expect to wait for an hour or more during peak dining hours.  I am a fan of their seating, as the booths and tables have adequate space within themselves and between each other.  Their sangria is always good.\n\nAmbiance:  Modern, spacious, clean, including the restrooms.  It feels comfortable without being pretentious here, and because tables are spaced fairly evenly apart, I would not consider the noise levels to be loud.\n\nService:  The servers are usually friendly and helpful, and they will have others assist them as needed for larger parties.  Think clearly of what you need and ask for it when your server is here, because on a busy night they may not be able to check on you that frequently.\n\nThe food:  you need to go in with a good plan.  Certain things you should avoid: \n\n-Skip the appetizers unless you have a large group and want everyone to be able to try a little something to accompany the bread and salad.\n-The Tour of Italy will leave you greased out and loathing anything Italian for days because it's just too heavy.  I advise skipping it along with most other lasagna-like dishes.  My advice instead is to stick with a simple entree because you will not be left hungry from the unlimited bread sticks and salad/soup included with your meal.  \n-Chicken Marsala over the stuffed version.  There isn't that big of a difference between the two.  Since this is a chain, the menu also points out how many calories are in each order.  That will be helpful to at least some in making a decision.  \n-They also have great after dinner mints that comes with the check and are fairly generous with them.  Take them home if you're too full!\n\nPrice:  \n-Spaghetti with meatballs costs $15, and the one without meatballs is among the cheapest items on the menu. Sounds expensive, I know, but the meatballs are huge.  \n-The herb-grilled salmon costs $20.\n-Even a slice of heavy lemon cream cake will cost around $8--not cheap.\nPeople will complain about the cost because it isn't cheap, but I think that between the generous portions, the free accompaniments, and the nice atmosphere, it's worth it.  Remember that the prices include all the freebies, of which I am a fan.  It'd be hard to get out of there without paying at least $25 per person for an entree, drink, and splitting a dessert(you will only need a single slice for two people).\n\nAside:\n-The reviews for the unlimited pasta/soup lunches that occur seasonally should be taken into context:  those will not necessarily translate to an equivalent dinner experience because it is a very different setting and menu.

We were seated in a nice booth and I advised the hostess that it was my mom's birthday and if she could alert the server.   \n\nOur server greeted us and said Happy Birthday to my mother, teased her about being 21 - she was humored (she's 81)...he was very nice.  We started with the Fonduta appetizer- which was YUMMY-- melted cheese blend (fondue) to spread on little slices of assorted bread.  Very, very good!   My husband had the garden salad and my mom and I both tried different soups- she had the chicken gnocchi soup and I had the potato soup- both very good.  The potato soup had a kick- but very good.\n\nFor our entrees- I couldn't decide, so I got the Taste of Italy- a small portion of chicken parmigiana, fettuccine Alfredo and lasagna.  I ate bits of all of it- think I liked the chicken best.  The leftovers will come in handy for lunch tomorrow.    But it was all very good.  Hubby had the mixed grill- skewers of chicken, beef and veggies- pretty much cleaned his plate.  Mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs- well it came as spaghetti and meat sauce.  We advised the server (who was not the one who took the order) and they brought out a side of meatballs very quickly.   Mom is a small eater, she said it was very good and now has 2-3 more meals from the leftovers. \n\nWe were asked if we wanted to order dessert- which we said yes and I purposely spoke loudly around the server to my mom- saying \"you want a scoop of ice cream on your birthday don't you?\"- again trying to remind the server that we had a birthday.   We ordered our desserts and they were delivered- without any birthday celebration...perhaps they don't do that there?  I don't know.   I would have expected a candle in her ice cream at the very least.\n\nThe Black Tie Mousse-cake was delicious, hubby had the lemon cream cake and that was also very good.  Mom had ice cream. :)\n\nOverall, good service and good food.

The staff is very friendly. You can reserve a dining room if you plan to eat with a big group. The food is alright. \nYes, there is usually a ridiculously long line that makes me question some people's priorities. But then I remember why there's a wait. A lot of people shop at Stonestown with their friends and families. All of whom roll up in their extra large vans, minivans, SUVs, tour busses, what have you, and they all seem to want to eat in a sit-down restaurant with waiter service, because the food court just won't cut it. A lot of the younger crowd from several neighboring schools have appetites and time to spare. Then there are the out-of-towners who don't have an Olive Garden in their local neighborhood. I'm assuming most of them arrived just after watching a hunger-inducing Olive Garden commercial.\n \nSo you see, there's no reason to get mad at Olive Garden for having a long wait time. Well, sometimes I do notice that they quote an insane 45min -1hr estimate when there are empty tables. I don't know what's up with that. Poor communication? *Shrugs* I don't know.\n\nThe menu offers the usual Italian dishes - pastas & pizzas, and other typical mainstream dishes that chain restaurants offer. What do you expect? Chain restaurants cater to the masses and stick to the familiar, comfort dishes that most people have heard of. It's not meant to be innovative and exciting.\n\nOk, to be honest, the only things I like here are the breadsticks and the zuppa toscana soup. \n\nBreadsticks come warm and wrapped in a napkin. They're buttery soft and salty. Don't take breadsticks home. They always harden up like a rock. It's never fun trying to revive hard bread.\n\nZuppa Toscana Soup is spicy and creamy, with pieces of kale that give it a good texture, minced spicy Italian sausage, and potatoes that soak up the broth. Yum. Can I just order this to go?\n\nIf you've never had Italian food before (and I'm pretty sure most people have), then try the...\nTour of Italy - includes Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna, Fettucine Alfredo. \na taste of all 3 for under $20. All of them are okay.\n\nBut you have had Italian food before? Then skip it. Most of the dishes are typically around the same caliber. Just get the zuppa toscana soup and enjoy your seat with wheels and the villa-esque ambience as you gaze out the window into a view of the parking lot.\n\nI've been here once or twice during the off-peak times and it was quite alright.

I would just order that if I ever find myself at an Olive Garden. \n\nOur waiter was pretty friendly.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-03-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread "], "author": "Nina M.", "review": "I go to Olive Garden now and then, once in a few months maybe longer.  However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.

I always kinda suspected that they were just being jaded. I mean, duh, it's a chain. Pasta Pomodoro's a chain and so is Macaroni Grill. I like eating at those places. But this place is is ridiculous. Most overpriced restaurant ever. We wanted something inexpensive, specifically the soup + bread + salad thing, but they don't do that on Sundays apparently. We ended up getting soup and salad anyway and at full price. We should have just gone to the food court for that, I know. I liked the Zuppa Toscana, but it was really salty.

Not sure why there were that many people at the front desk when it was not so busy.\n\nThe server was friendly and efficient.  So we've no complaints with our service.\n\nFirstly we ordered drinks:  Cocktail and wine.  The cocktail hardly contained any amount of alcohol, but at least it was refreshing.  Wine was a pinot grigio which was ok.\n\nAs for appetizers, I'm not sure why they serve mussels that comes with alot of sauce but with no spoons nor any bowl for the shells.  Had to request these which was no problem, but they ought to be standard.  As for the mussels, well, many were closed.  And those that were opened were the smallest ever & also were overcooked so most were shriveled up.  \n\nMains were the pastas.

Truly I would not waste time and money to wait and wait to dine here; one is better off going to an authentic Italian restaurant instead.  Also I feel that their prices are quite high for the non-stellar food they offer.  They need to improve on this if they insist on charging these sorts of prices for a chain even.

When asked what she wanted to eat for dinner she responds with \"Olive Garden\" only I think it was a ruse because she wanted me to go to Sephora with her...lol! \n\nThe Olive Garden we chose is in the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall which is a hop and a skip around the corner from SFSU. So the fact that it was located in a mall means ample parking. We arrived at about 4:30 and didn't take too long to find parking, within decent walking distance of the front door of the restaurant. \n\nFor a party of 8, Olive Garden gave me an estimated wait time of 20 minutes, not too shabby, especially for dinner time on a Saturday. Although I think there wasn't much of a wait because everyone seemed to be next door at Marugame Udon and maybe part of it has to do with the reason I could only muster 2 stars for this review.  Marugame Udon had the line snaked in front and then even had to split it into two because of how long the line was. I of course made a mental note that will need to try it next time. It was like that when we left Olive Garden and when we finally left the mall at 8PM.\n\nSo the hostess at Olive Garden was pleasant and didn't ask how to spell my name (America), you have no idea how many people ask. Our party was then called and we were escorted to the back in what seemed to be a more private room. Come to find out it's where they stick the families with the crying babies...lol! Didn't bother us too much because we are kind of a loud speaking family so we may have had the crying babies beat by a few octaves. \n\nOur server was prompt with our bread and took our drink orders. While everyone ordered their arnold palmer's and water, I also ordered their special: Blackberry Watermelon Margarita. When it came, it tasted like Minute Maid juice slushy in a salt rimmed glass, not even a hint of alcohol. Bleh and disappointing! She brought us our drinks and then took our appetizer and dinner orders. The appetizers came (fried mozzerella and calamari) and when I asked her to take the wine glasses on the table as we would not be ordering any wine, she forgot to take them when she set our appetizers down. The table was kind of small for our party of 8 and I was trying to make good use of the room we had and remove any superfluous items i.e them wine glasses! I hadn't realize how small the portion size was for the appetizers and we only ordered 2 because it's all that tempted us. Only our waitress did not come back until she had our dinner's ready but I put in another order of calamari anyway since my mom enjoyed it. \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp and chicken carbonara's, a pasta chips nachos, 2 shrimp scampi, spaghetti, shrimp alfredo and salmon with broccoli. My husband tends to gauge all his meals against my cooking and he was NOT happy with his shrimp and chicken carbonara. He had me taste it and the chicken had a weird texture to it as if it had been previously frozen after being lightly breaded (almost the same consistency of a McDonald's chicken nugget if you take the breading off) and the shrimp was gummy. My salmon and broccoli were delicious. My son ordered the shrimp scampi and was unimpressed because the asparagus that came in the dish was raw and hard. My mother's boyfriend ordered the pasta chips nachos and he said he was a fan. The chips seemed to be a fried won ton consistency and held up against the meat mixture they topped it with. \n\nOur bill came out to be $230 and I would not have flinched at that price had we had a more attentive waitress and the quality of food was better. I know it's Olive Garden and not some world renowned Italian restaurant but come on, people work hard for their money and make contingencies to enjoy a meal away from home. This was not our first time here and my mom was just here for Mother's Day with my sister and brother and she said the service and food was the same then, but she wanted to give it another try. I don't give 2 star reviews, I really try to give establishments the benefit of the doubt because I get there are off days. I unfortunately could not take that approach this time and I think it should be duly noted that Olive Garden you are a pretty well known restaurant and there has to be some sort of second look of your quality control standards and maybe someone should watch to see how often your servers are checking in on the patrons.

", "Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\n"], "author": "Nina M.", "review": "I go to Olive Garden now and then, once in a few months maybe longer.  However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.

Breadsticks were soft and warm, lightly brushed with melted butter on top. We ordered the zuppa toscana soup and it was creamy and spicy with kale and Italian sausage bits. I really liked the soup and would recommend others to try it if you can handle spicy. Famous house salad was good too, as expected! The pepperocinis were a nice twist. The breadsticks, unlimited salad, and soup was what drew us here, and all that was delicious! Everything else though was disappointing and the night went downhill from here. \n\nService was either MIA or fleeting.  Our table didn't even have utensils. Server didn't notice, neither did the host. We were served our salad and soup but couldn't enjoy anything until we had to flag a staff member down. Would've told our server, but she wasn't around! She barely came by to check on us, also forgot about our appetizer until we asked her about it, and that was 10 mins after when we were already finished the salad, soup, and breadsticks.

We ordered a three sampler appetizer - stuffed mushrooms, fried mozzarella, and parmesan crusted zucchini. Zucchini had too much salt, didn't finish. Stuffed mushrooms were meh. Didn't finish either. Best appetizer of the three was the fried mozzarella. As for the entrees, my bf ordered a create your own -- grilled chicken, angel hair pasta, and asiago garlic alfredo sauce. I ordered a shrimp scampi. My bf's create your own pasta was dull and did not have enough sauce. His angel hair pasta was dry af. The grilled chicken was good, but he couldn't finish the pasta. My shrimp scampi was meh. Compared to my bf's, the shrimp scampi had too much sauce to the point the noodles were soggy. I was disappointed because the presentation definitely did not look like their advertised photo on the menu. There were more than 3 shrimps though!

However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.

Thus our thought was hummm why not the Olive Garden, the commercials seem pretty nice, and people have said they taste good.  OK off we go!\n\nWhen we arrived, it had a nice ambiance, a good flavor to the restaurant.  We were seated and once the waiter came, he asked if we would like to sample the wine of the day . . . (as he shows the bottle).  Umm . . . once we saw that the wine was a \"SCREW TOP\" there was no way I was going for it.  My fiance and I looked at each other and said \"no thanks!\"\n\nWell maybe my expectation were too high, but when I asked if there were any daily specials our waiter was dumbfounded!  He was like \"um . . . we don't really have any specials but we have this pasta bowl all you can eat . . . \"  Wow, I would expect you to at least have some sort of answer.  Then I asked about the board in the front, and he said that they just randomly placed one of the dishes up and he would go check what was up there.  MAN he didn't even know what was on the board!\n\nWell my fiance ordered Chicken & Gnocchi soup with a Berry Acqua Fresca drink and I tried the pasta bowl special.  As an appetizer we went with a sampler of Calamari and Stuffed Mushrooms.  As we waited for our food, we looked at the decor, which wasn't bad expect for our chairs.  The were cushioned chairs with wheels attached to it.  We felt as if we were sitting in a nursing home chair!!!!\n\nWhen her soup came, so did the bread sticks and salad.  For this being my first time, they gave me the whole salad bowl and looked like we were to mix it ourselves.  Wait, isn't that what I am paying for?!?!?!?  My fiances soup was salty, but adding a little pepper helped (a little!).  The gnocchi was very grainy and it tasted like it was frozen and not fresh.  They plopped two large chunks of chicken into the soup as if it was just cut and dropped in.  Ughhh . . .  not good so far.  As for the bread sticks, we were laughing that they were a dinner roll basted with olive oil on top.  \n\nWow so far everything we could have done at home, and made taste better.\n\nMy pasta arrived at the same time as our appetizers.  (I ordered the whole wheat linguine with creamy portabella mushroom) Oh my gosh . . . BLAH.  The pasta was way over cooked and the mushy.  I couldn't even eat more than two bites.  It tasted like it was microwaved!  It was like the pasta was to match the chairs, I was really in a NURSING HOME!!!!  I asked for another pasta bowl, fearful of its taste geting the orecchiette with the three meat sauce.  This bowl was at least edible, with the sauce being decent.  The pasta this time was not over cooked but I could tell they were not fresh because of most of it being stuck together.  That saved my dinner, sort of =P\n\nOur appetizers didn't help the situation because of the calamari.  I love fried calamari, one of my favorite dishes, even if the batter isn't great, most of the time I can forgive it but these were grainy and not very fresh.  There was no chewiness to it and just kinda broke apart in your mouth!  The mushrooms at least had a little better flavor, but still not a fan favorite, but by far the best dish eaten during the night.  Oh and not to forget our Berry Fresca Aquga, it well, tasted like Robitussin cough!   BLAHHHHH.\n\nMy recomondation, not for me, even though it seemed as if many people enjoy it, not for me.

"], "author": "David D.", "review": "Great family dining here, I'm not kidding!  \n\nFor round 2 of hijacking my weekend, mother-in-law pulled a trump card:  It's her names day.  To Russians, a names day is like a birthday.  It's a saint's day on the religious calendar, and everyone named after the saint gets a party.  Four saints are observed today:  Vera, Nadejda, Lubova, and Sophia.  Translated:  Faith, Hope, Love, and Wisdom.  \n\nThat's a lot of names, and they are popular.  Back in Shanghai, in the 1930s, half the Russian population would celebrate on this day.  \n\nMom asked me out to lunch to celebrate her names day.  OK, why not?  She picked me up, and I took a very interesting ride to the Olive Garden.  Have you ever ridden shotgun with an 81-year-old driver?  It isn't pretty.  \n\nI had doubts about the Olive Garden.  It's a large-corporation chain, after all, and an intrusion of suburbia upon the city.  But it was her names day, and the honoree gets whatever she wants.  \n\nThere are usually long lines and a 1-hour wait at this Olive Garden.  Today, at 1 pm, the wait was 5 minutes.  Numerous dining areas wrap around the entrance, and we found ourselves in a little 12-table alcove decorated in an Etruscan style, with pictures of Rome on the walls.  It turned out we had both been to Italy, so the conversation became a pleasant comparison of notes.  \n\nThe waitress introduced herself, and the magic began.  The first thing I noticed was that the staff was polite to everyone.  From babies to great-grandparents with walkers, they had light banter and suggestions appropriate for all.  Our suggestion was to start with a Riesling and a sampler appetizer of stuffed mushrooms and chicken fingers.  The mushrooms were stuffed with clam meat, among other things, and the \"fingers\" were about 1\" x 7\", much more than I expected.  \n\nWhen Mom asked for a salad and I didn't, the waitress brought two sets of plates and flatware, and there was still salad left over in the mixing bowl when we were both satisfied.  \n\nMom ordered the seafood portofino, hold the mussels, and the waitress said that would be no problem.  I chose braised beef and tortelloni.  The seafood was on a bed of capellini, and Mom had a smile on her face all the way through the meal.  The braised beef tips were medium-rare, maybe marinaded, and totally blew my mind!   Tender, and tasty, the beef was top quality.  Although I haven't been in one for 10 years, I fell in love with the Olive Garden all over again with that dish!  The tortelloni had asiago in it, and of course I ate it all.  \n\nI had told the waitress it was Mom's birthday, and they did up a special presentation for dessert:  a black bowtie cake for Mom, and tiramisu for me.  Not a North Beach tiramisu, more like a Ben & Jerry's tiramisu, but it went great with my cappuccino.  \n\nMom swooped down on the check like a falcon on a field mouse, so I didn't get to see what the total was.  I'm guessing, from crib notes, that it was around $80.  But for me, it was free! \n\nBeing kind to your relatives can pay back immediately.  And, as the afternoon food coma sunk in, I realized Mom had succeeded.  My original plan for the day had been sidetracked, and she got her celebration for her names day.", "rating": 5, "date": "2007-09-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The appetizer sampler, we picked fried zucchini, stuffed mushrooms, and calamari.

Yeah... I am pretty sure it is some form of crack... then you have the salad... I like their dressing... a little on the salty end... so, I can't have too much before I feel like I need to swallow a gallon of water, but that is ok... I have plenty of refills on my ice tea... which I do not sweeten... I never do... their tea is pretty good... doesn't have the over brewed flavor that some other places tend to have.  So, again... I do not complain.  \n\nAnd after shopping all day... I will actually contemplate ordering an appetizer.  You ca never go wrong with the stuffed mushrooms... hey... they are cheesy!

However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.

The best part was the FIRST part which included the breadsticks, unlimited salad, and soup. They were just as I remember and worth eating and ordering over and over again. Breadsticks were soft and warm, lightly brushed with melted butter on top. We ordered the zuppa toscana soup and it was creamy and spicy with kale and Italian sausage bits. I really liked the soup and would recommend others to try it if you can handle spicy. Famous house salad was good too, as expected! The pepperocinis were a nice twist. The breadsticks, unlimited salad, and soup was what drew us here, and all that was delicious! Everything else though was disappointing and the night went downhill from here. \n\nService was either MIA or fleeting.  Our table didn't even have utensils. Server didn't notice, neither did the host. We were served our salad and soup but couldn't enjoy anything until we had to flag a staff member down. Would've told our server, but she wasn't around! She barely came by to check on us, also forgot about our appetizer until we asked her about it, and that was 10 mins after when we were already finished the salad, soup, and breadsticks. So everything was really slow. I could tell she was stressed. \n\nThe appetizers and entrees lacked flavor or had TOO MUCH seasoning. We ordered a three sampler appetizer - stuffed mushrooms, fried mozzarella, and parmesan crusted zucchini. Zucchini had too much salt, didn't finish. Stuffed mushrooms were meh. Didn't finish either. Best appetizer of the three was the fried mozzarella. As for the entrees, my bf ordered a create your own -- grilled chicken, angel hair pasta, and asiago garlic alfredo sauce. I ordered a shrimp scampi. My bf's create your own pasta was dull and did not have enough sauce. His angel hair pasta was dry af. The grilled chicken was good, but he couldn't finish the pasta. My shrimp scampi was meh. Compared to my bf's, the shrimp scampi had too much sauce to the point the noodles were soggy. I was disappointed because the presentation definitely did not look like their advertised photo on the menu. There were more than 3 shrimps though! I ate it but probably should've ordered something else on the menu.\n\nIt's been years since I've eaten at Olive Garden and this recent experience delays me from wanting to come back. Both food and service needs improvement. \n\nALSO... they should remove the self-order game machine. It's deceiving and charges $1.99 for just touching the thing.

When asked what she wanted to eat for dinner she responds with \"Olive Garden\" only I think it was a ruse because she wanted me to go to Sephora with her...lol! \n\nThe Olive Garden we chose is in the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall which is a hop and a skip around the corner from SFSU. So the fact that it was located in a mall means ample parking. We arrived at about 4:30 and didn't take too long to find parking, within decent walking distance of the front door of the restaurant. \n\nFor a party of 8, Olive Garden gave me an estimated wait time of 20 minutes, not too shabby, especially for dinner time on a Saturday. Although I think there wasn't much of a wait because everyone seemed to be next door at Marugame Udon and maybe part of it has to do with the reason I could only muster 2 stars for this review.  Marugame Udon had the line snaked in front and then even had to split it into two because of how long the line was. I of course made a mental note that will need to try it next time. It was like that when we left Olive Garden and when we finally left the mall at 8PM.\n\nSo the hostess at Olive Garden was pleasant and didn't ask how to spell my name (America), you have no idea how many people ask. Our party was then called and we were escorted to the back in what seemed to be a more private room. Come to find out it's where they stick the families with the crying babies...lol! Didn't bother us too much because we are kind of a loud speaking family so we may have had the crying babies beat by a few octaves. \n\nOur server was prompt with our bread and took our drink orders. While everyone ordered their arnold palmer's and water, I also ordered their special: Blackberry Watermelon Margarita. When it came, it tasted like Minute Maid juice slushy in a salt rimmed glass, not even a hint of alcohol. Bleh and disappointing! She brought us our drinks and then took our appetizer and dinner orders. The appetizers came (fried mozzerella and calamari) and when I asked her to take the wine glasses on the table as we would not be ordering any wine, she forgot to take them when she set our appetizers down. The table was kind of small for our party of 8 and I was trying to make good use of the room we had and remove any superfluous items i.e them wine glasses! I hadn't realize how small the portion size was for the appetizers and we only ordered 2 because it's all that tempted us. Only our waitress did not come back until she had our dinner's ready but I put in another order of calamari anyway since my mom enjoyed it. \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp and chicken carbonara's, a pasta chips nachos, 2 shrimp scampi, spaghetti, shrimp alfredo and salmon with broccoli. My husband tends to gauge all his meals against my cooking and he was NOT happy with his shrimp and chicken carbonara. He had me taste it and the chicken had a weird texture to it as if it had been previously frozen after being lightly breaded (almost the same consistency of a McDonald's chicken nugget if you take the breading off) and the shrimp was gummy. My salmon and broccoli were delicious. My son ordered the shrimp scampi and was unimpressed because the asparagus that came in the dish was raw and hard. My mother's boyfriend ordered the pasta chips nachos and he said he was a fan. The chips seemed to be a fried won ton consistency and held up against the meat mixture they topped it with. \n\nOur bill came out to be $230 and I would not have flinched at that price had we had a more attentive waitress and the quality of food was better. I know it's Olive Garden and not some world renowned Italian restaurant but come on, people work hard for their money and make contingencies to enjoy a meal away from home. This was not our first time here and my mom was just here for Mother's Day with my sister and brother and she said the service and food was the same then, but she wanted to give it another try. I don't give 2 star reviews, I really try to give establishments the benefit of the doubt because I get there are off days. I unfortunately could not take that approach this time and I think it should be duly noted that Olive Garden you are a pretty well known restaurant and there has to be some sort of second look of your quality control standards and maybe someone should watch to see how often your servers are checking in on the patrons.

I can honestly tell you the deal is so worth it. In fact, it really is the only reason to go to \"The OG\" as I call it. Look the place isn't perfect, It's large, loud, service is decent if somewhat lacking because they're always so busy, and the food is well at its Olive Garden best.\n\nI only go to the OG when there is a \"Buy One Take One\" deal because not only is it a ton of food to eat while you are there, but you get to take a full dish home. You start with the all you can eat soup and salad with a side of breadsticks. Then you pick between four pasta dishes or three meat and/or shrimp dishes for an additional sum.\n\nBut since this meal deal also comes with the all you can eat soup and salad, you know what I plan on feasting on while I'm actually dining at the OG. First off my top priority is to enjoy all the soup and salad and breadsticks you can, and have a few bites of your pasta that your dinner plan actually consists of, and then get a to go box to take that one home on top of the one you order to take home. That's what I did and I'm not ashamed! \n\nI start off with the Zuppa Toscana soup which is a wonderful creamy hearty soup with plenty of sausage, kale and potatoes. And then I move onto the Minestrone which is decent if not remarkable, and then I finish with the Chicken & Gnocchi soup which is so hearty I don't have any room for anything else. It helps that my fellow diners get salad because they don't like soup, so I happily sponged off a few bites of their all-you-can eat salad. Clearly I have no shame!\n\nI found the pastas the OG is offering BOGO taste decent, but not great. Sauce was lacking on my Cavatappi with Asiago Garlic Alfredo, and the newest pastas they offer with this meal deal, the Penne with Basil Garlic Marinara tasted rather unremarkable. I also remembered to sign up for the Olive Garden Eclub, in which you get emailed a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. (Which our server had to ask his manager if it was allowed with the Buy One Take One Meal Deal, thankfully it was!) So we started with the trio sample appetizer with fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and toasted ravioli. They were okay, but nothing I would order on their own. \n\nAt the end of our meal despite being stuffed, we decided to try a dessert. We agreed on the Zeppoli, which are the Italian doughnuts. To my amazement, the doughnuts tasted delicious. They were light and sugary and perfect when paired with the chocolate dipping sauce. It was the perfect end to an overstuffed meal.\n\nOlive Garden is not like eating in Rome or even San Francisco's North Beach, and it's no were near the quality or overall deal that Maggiano's has to offer. But it's a decent place with affordable prices that does tend to get really crowded on weekends for dinner. But that's what still makes the place so amazing: the fact that people still enjoy this place after so many years.

This time, its regular price $14.99 but because i liked it, i wanted to eat it again. I usually cant finish my entree after all the breadsticks, salad, and soup. SO its nice to know i have a yummy lunch the next day. The eggplant Parmigiana was a bit lacking this time but it was still good. The eggplant is breaded so last time it was crispy where as this time, it was as little soggy. I also had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert valued at $10.

Thus our thought was hummm why not the Olive Garden, the commercials seem pretty nice, and people have said they taste good.  OK off we go!\n\nWhen we arrived, it had a nice ambiance, a good flavor to the restaurant.  We were seated and once the waiter came, he asked if we would like to sample the wine of the day . . . (as he shows the bottle).  Umm . . . once we saw that the wine was a \"SCREW TOP\" there was no way I was going for it.  My fiance and I looked at each other and said \"no thanks!\"\n\nWell maybe my expectation were too high, but when I asked if there were any daily specials our waiter was dumbfounded!  He was like \"um . . . we don't really have any specials but we have this pasta bowl all you can eat . . . \"  Wow, I would expect you to at least have some sort of answer.  Then I asked about the board in the front, and he said that they just randomly placed one of the dishes up and he would go check what was up there.  MAN he didn't even know what was on the board!\n\nWell my fiance ordered Chicken & Gnocchi soup with a Berry Acqua Fresca drink and I tried the pasta bowl special.  As an appetizer we went with a sampler of Calamari and Stuffed Mushrooms.  As we waited for our food, we looked at the decor, which wasn't bad expect for our chairs.  The were cushioned chairs with wheels attached to it.  We felt as if we were sitting in a nursing home chair!!!!\n\nWhen her soup came, so did the bread sticks and salad.  For this being my first time, they gave me the whole salad bowl and looked like we were to mix it ourselves.  Wait, isn't that what I am paying for?!?!?!?  My fiances soup was salty, but adding a little pepper helped (a little!).  The gnocchi was very grainy and it tasted like it was frozen and not fresh.  They plopped two large chunks of chicken into the soup as if it was just cut and dropped in.  Ughhh . . .  not good so far.  As for the bread sticks, we were laughing that they were a dinner roll basted with olive oil on top.  \n\nWow so far everything we could have done at home, and made taste better.\n\nMy pasta arrived at the same time as our appetizers.  (I ordered the whole wheat linguine with creamy portabella mushroom) Oh my gosh . . . BLAH.  The pasta was way over cooked and the mushy.  I couldn't even eat more than two bites.  It tasted like it was microwaved!  It was like the pasta was to match the chairs, I was really in a NURSING HOME!!!!  I asked for another pasta bowl, fearful of its taste geting the orecchiette with the three meat sauce.  This bowl was at least edible, with the sauce being decent.  The pasta this time was not over cooked but I could tell they were not fresh because of most of it being stuck together.  That saved my dinner, sort of =P\n\nOur appetizers didn't help the situation because of the calamari.  I love fried calamari, one of my favorite dishes, even if the batter isn't great, most of the time I can forgive it but these were grainy and not very fresh.  There was no chewiness to it and just kinda broke apart in your mouth!  The mushrooms at least had a little better flavor, but still not a fan favorite, but by far the best dish eaten during the night.  Oh and not to forget our Berry Fresca Aquga, it well, tasted like Robitussin cough!   BLAHHHHH.\n\nMy recomondation, not for me, even though it seemed as if many people enjoy it, not for me.

When asked what she wanted to eat for dinner she responds with \"Olive Garden\" only I think it was a ruse because she wanted me to go to Sephora with her...lol! \n\nThe Olive Garden we chose is in the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall which is a hop and a skip around the corner from SFSU. So the fact that it was located in a mall means ample parking. We arrived at about 4:30 and didn't take too long to find parking, within decent walking distance of the front door of the restaurant. \n\nFor a party of 8, Olive Garden gave me an estimated wait time of 20 minutes, not too shabby, especially for dinner time on a Saturday. Although I think there wasn't much of a wait because everyone seemed to be next door at Marugame Udon and maybe part of it has to do with the reason I could only muster 2 stars for this review.  Marugame Udon had the line snaked in front and then even had to split it into two because of how long the line was. I of course made a mental note that will need to try it next time. It was like that when we left Olive Garden and when we finally left the mall at 8PM.\n\nSo the hostess at Olive Garden was pleasant and didn't ask how to spell my name (America), you have no idea how many people ask. Our party was then called and we were escorted to the back in what seemed to be a more private room. Come to find out it's where they stick the families with the crying babies...lol! Didn't bother us too much because we are kind of a loud speaking family so we may have had the crying babies beat by a few octaves. \n\nOur server was prompt with our bread and took our drink orders. While everyone ordered their arnold palmer's and water, I also ordered their special: Blackberry Watermelon Margarita. When it came, it tasted like Minute Maid juice slushy in a salt rimmed glass, not even a hint of alcohol. Bleh and disappointing! She brought us our drinks and then took our appetizer and dinner orders. The appetizers came (fried mozzerella and calamari) and when I asked her to take the wine glasses on the table as we would not be ordering any wine, she forgot to take them when she set our appetizers down. The table was kind of small for our party of 8 and I was trying to make good use of the room we had and remove any superfluous items i.e them wine glasses! I hadn't realize how small the portion size was for the appetizers and we only ordered 2 because it's all that tempted us. Only our waitress did not come back until she had our dinner's ready but I put in another order of calamari anyway since my mom enjoyed it. \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp and chicken carbonara's, a pasta chips nachos, 2 shrimp scampi, spaghetti, shrimp alfredo and salmon with broccoli. My husband tends to gauge all his meals against my cooking and he was NOT happy with his shrimp and chicken carbonara. He had me taste it and the chicken had a weird texture to it as if it had been previously frozen after being lightly breaded (almost the same consistency of a McDonald's chicken nugget if you take the breading off) and the shrimp was gummy. My salmon and broccoli were delicious. My son ordered the shrimp scampi and was unimpressed because the asparagus that came in the dish was raw and hard. My mother's boyfriend ordered the pasta chips nachos and he said he was a fan. The chips seemed to be a fried won ton consistency and held up against the meat mixture they topped it with. \n\nOur bill came out to be $230 and I would not have flinched at that price had we had a more attentive waitress and the quality of food was better. I know it's Olive Garden and not some world renowned Italian restaurant but come on, people work hard for their money and make contingencies to enjoy a meal away from home. This was not our first time here and my mom was just here for Mother's Day with my sister and brother and she said the service and food was the same then, but she wanted to give it another try. I don't give 2 star reviews, I really try to give establishments the benefit of the doubt because I get there are off days. I unfortunately could not take that approach this time and I think it should be duly noted that Olive Garden you are a pretty well known restaurant and there has to be some sort of second look of your quality control standards and maybe someone should watch to see how often your servers are checking in on the patrons. When I spend money and take the time to travel and decide on where I want to spend my hard earned money I want it to be at a place that takes pride in their name and food and are attentive to my needs.", "rating": 2, "date": "2018-06-11"}, {"excerpts": ["chicken scampi - noodles had a strong wine taste, chicken was bland \n\nshrimp alfredo - alfredo makes everything better "], "author": "Yuzuki K.", "review": "came with a friend on new years day for lunch~ got seated quite quickly\n\nPasta portions are huge and can be easily shared between two people (I mean $20 a plate is to be expected) but honestly the appetizers, soup, and breadsticks are enough to fill you up (probably tastier than the entrees too)\n\nyou can choose a side of soup or salad (unlimited refills!) and top your orders with as much grated cheese as you like lmao\n\nbreadsticks - only. come. for. the. breadsticks. \n\nchicken scampi - noodles had a strong wine taste, chicken was bland \n\nshrimp alfredo - alfredo makes everything better i stg\n\nstuffed portobello mushrooms - mediocre.. way too little for $9. go get yourself a nice big bowl of pho at a vietnamese restaurant instead\n\nchicken gnocchi and minestrone soup - much better than the two pasta dishes~ go for the zuppa toscana if you're looking for something warm and creamy :D minestrone for something lighter to prep you for the heavy entrees\n\ntotal was around $60! plus an extra $1.99 for accidentally playing the table games haha...... better to waste that money at an all you can eat buffet. \n\nonly things worth complimenting are the soup, breadsticks, and customer service. unless you're starving or don't know how to cook your own pasta at home i wouldn't recommend coming to this place.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-01-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Ordered chicken and gnnochi, house salad, some starter set, shrimp alfredo and chicken carbonara, 2 unlimited drinks.. came out to 62 dollars.. and considering the amount that came in....

Didn't expect much but they did give a big bowl of it.\n\nI got the Strawberry-Passion Fruit Limonata $3.50 and I really liked it.

My girlfriend and I joked about checking it out for a while, and since we had a long work day ahead, we decided to give ourselves a break and check it out.\n\nThe thing that stood out to me immediately was the price of the food here.  I was in sticker shock at some of the entrees!  Luckily there was a $25 special for two entrees with either an appetizer or dessert.  I ended up selecting the fettuccine Alfredo and my girlfriend got the ravioli, and we shared the mussels appetizer.  She originally wanted the eggplant Parmesan but they were somehow OUT!  This is unacceptable, especially for an Olive Garden, and I could have easily gone back there and made it myself.  Other than that, the food was mostly so-so, but I did really enjoy the pasta fagioli and the cream soup, as well as the breadsticks.

The unlimited refills on breadsticks, salad, and soup is perfect for my cheapo Chinese family. I know everyone raves about their breadsticks but I personally found them a little too salty.

I like soup, he loves soup.  I love salad, he likes salad.  We both eat a lot, so unlimited portions of each sounded like a good deal.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, I had been to an Olive Garden.  \nIt was a funny story in that many people from my family had gotten together to help a relative move, and *I* was insistent that we should all head to Olive Garden because the commercials made the pasta look good.  *I* convinced the whole lot of us to go. It would require four cars packed full and a 10 minute drive but everyone agreed to go;  I was happy.  Later,  they all climbed into the cars to head to the restaurant, and took off before I had gotten out of the house.  Seriously - they left me behind because they forgot about me.  I sat by the garage in disbelief for 20 minutes - which was exactly how long it took them to get to the restaurant and realize I was missing.  Yeah, the family had a great laugh at my expense and still talk about the event, \"Remember when we left Grace behind?\"  \n\nYeah - very funny.\n\nAnyhow, back to the food.  I believe I had a fettuccine alfredo on that day when I finally got picked up to go to the restaurant, and it was just okay.   I mean - I obviously never returned again for 12 years, so it couldn't have been that good.\n\nIn any case, one evening several months ago, we headed to OG, again based on advertising. \n\nAt this particular location, service was a mixed bag.  Some servers were outstanding, others walked around with a sign on their forehead that read: 'Nobody Home\".  We sat in a typical OG booth and perused the menu to see what was offered.  \n\nThere was only one kind of salad, but about five soups offered.\n\nLet me put it this way.\nNever before or since have I had a salad this boring.  BORING.\nEach soup we tried was begging for a quick death.  It's hard to make all five soups bad, but somehow, OG managed to do just that.  Even accidentally, one of five soups should have been decent at least, but nope, they beat all the odds!\n\nWhen a restaurant offers \"unlimited\" anything, one of the main concerns may be that people with enormous appetites will come and eat them out of house and home.  Well, OG has figured out the quickest way to make sure that not only do people not request seconds - they don't even make a second visit!\n\nWe looked at each other across the table and agreed that this was a good effort at eating cheap and eating healthy, but nope - this would not suffice.  Not for us.\n\nNot in this lifetime.\nWe went home utterly dissatisfied and made instant noodles.\n\nThe upside, though, is that at least this time, I wasn't left behind.", "rating": 1, "date": "2009-12-12"}, {"excerpts": ["a small portion of chicken parmigiana, fettuccine Alfredo and lasagna.

We were seated in a nice booth and I advised the hostess that it was my mom's birthday and if she could alert the server.   \n\nOur server greeted us and said Happy Birthday to my mother, teased her about being 21 - she was humored (she's 81)...he was very nice.  We started with the Fonduta appetizer- which was YUMMY-- melted cheese blend (fondue) to spread on little slices of assorted bread.  Very, very good!   My husband had the garden salad and my mom and I both tried different soups- she had the chicken gnocchi soup and I had the potato soup- both very good.  The potato soup had a kick- but very good.\n\nFor our entrees- I couldn't decide, so I got the Taste of Italy- a small portion of chicken parmigiana, fettuccine Alfredo and lasagna.  I ate bits of all of it- think I liked the chicken best.  The leftovers will come in handy for lunch tomorrow.    But it was all very good.

Mom is a small eater, she said it was very good and now has 2-3 more meals from the leftovers. \n\nWe were asked if we wanted to order dessert- which we said yes and I purposely spoke loudly around the server to my mom- saying \"you want a scoop of ice cream on your birthday don't you?\"- again trying to remind the server that we had a birthday.   We ordered our desserts and they were delivered- without any birthday celebration...perhaps they don't do that there?  I don't know.   I would have expected a candle in her ice cream at the very least.\n\nThe Black Tie Mousse-cake was delicious, hubby had the lemon cream cake and that was also very good.

Didn't expect much but they did give a big bowl of it.\n\nI got the Strawberry-Passion Fruit Limonata $3.50 and I really liked it.

The staff is very friendly. You can reserve a dining room if you plan to eat with a big group. The food is alright. \nYes, there is usually a ridiculously long line that makes me question some people's priorities. But then I remember why there's a wait. A lot of people shop at Stonestown with their friends and families. All of whom roll up in their extra large vans, minivans, SUVs, tour busses, what have you, and they all seem to want to eat in a sit-down restaurant with waiter service, because the food court just won't cut it. A lot of the younger crowd from several neighboring schools have appetites and time to spare. Then there are the out-of-towners who don't have an Olive Garden in their local neighborhood. I'm assuming most of them arrived just after watching a hunger-inducing Olive Garden commercial.\n \nSo you see, there's no reason to get mad at Olive Garden for having a long wait time. Well, sometimes I do notice that they quote an insane 45min -1hr estimate when there are empty tables. I don't know what's up with that. Poor communication? *Shrugs* I don't know.\n\nThe menu offers the usual Italian dishes - pastas & pizzas, and other typical mainstream dishes that chain restaurants offer. What do you expect? Chain restaurants cater to the masses and stick to the familiar, comfort dishes that most people have heard of. It's not meant to be innovative and exciting.\n\nOk, to be honest, the only things I like here are the breadsticks and the zuppa toscana soup. \n\nBreadsticks come warm and wrapped in a napkin. They're buttery soft and salty. Don't take breadsticks home. They always harden up like a rock. It's never fun trying to revive hard bread.\n\nZuppa Toscana Soup is spicy and creamy, with pieces of kale that give it a good texture, minced spicy Italian sausage, and potatoes that soak up the broth. Yum. Can I just order this to go?\n\nIf you've never had Italian food before (and I'm pretty sure most people have), then try the...\nTour of Italy - includes Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna, Fettucine Alfredo. \na taste of all 3 for under $20.

Just get the zuppa toscana soup and enjoy your seat with wheels and the villa-esque ambience as you gaze out the window into a view of the parking lot.\n\nI've been here once or twice during the off-peak times and it was quite alright. I don't think it's worth anyone's time to clutch a cumbersome square beeper and wait around an hour for the food here though.

"], "author": "Stephen N.", "review": "I'm born and raised in San Francisco.  I share the same default reaction to roll my eyes at chain restaurants as other \"sophisticated\" diners in this great city.   \n\nI went to Olive Garden, however, before I became a food snob and knew about the local versus chain distinction.  And I'll be honest:  I had a lot of good times here, as it is the only one in the city.  I have come here during very different stages of life, and I can appreciate it in a different light now, in the sense that it is family and kid-friendly(has changing station in restroom, kid's menu, etc.).\n\nI won't bother comparing this to \"authentic\" Italian cuisine since I have been to many Italian restaurants but never one in Italy.  I think I know what Italian food tastes like.  But here's what you'll get when you come here:  a wait, nice ambiance, pretty good service, tasty food, a full stomach, and an above average price for the check.\n\nWaiting:  They don't take reservations, so if you are coming on a weekend, either come really early(and still have to hang out nearby for 20 or so minutes), or expect to wait for an hour or more during peak dining hours.  I am a fan of their seating, as the booths and tables have adequate space within themselves and between each other.  Their sangria is always good.\n\nAmbiance:  Modern, spacious, clean, including the restrooms.  It feels comfortable without being pretentious here, and because tables are spaced fairly evenly apart, I would not consider the noise levels to be loud.\n\nService:  The servers are usually friendly and helpful, and they will have others assist them as needed for larger parties.  Think clearly of what you need and ask for it when your server is here, because on a busy night they may not be able to check on you that frequently.\n\nThe food:  you need to go in with a good plan.  Certain things you should avoid: \n\n-Skip the appetizers unless you have a large group and want everyone to be able to try a little something to accompany the bread and salad.\n-The Tour of Italy will leave you greased out and loathing anything Italian for days because it's just too heavy.  I advise skipping it along with most other lasagna-like dishes.  My advice instead is to stick with a simple entree because you will not be left hungry from the unlimited bread sticks and salad/soup included with your meal.  \n-Chicken Marsala over the stuffed version.  There isn't that big of a difference between the two.  Since this is a chain, the menu also points out how many calories are in each order.  That will be helpful to at least some in making a decision.  \n-They also have great after dinner mints that comes with the check and are fairly generous with them.  Take them home if you're too full!\n\nPrice:  \n-Spaghetti with meatballs costs $15, and the one without meatballs is among the cheapest items on the menu. Sounds expensive, I know, but the meatballs are huge.  \n-The herb-grilled salmon costs $20.\n-Even a slice of heavy lemon cream cake will cost around $8--not cheap.\nPeople will complain about the cost because it isn't cheap, but I think that between the generous portions, the free accompaniments, and the nice atmosphere, it's worth it.  Remember that the prices include all the freebies, of which I am a fan.  It'd be hard to get out of there without paying at least $25 per person for an entree, drink, and splitting a dessert(you will only need a single slice for two people).\n\nAside:\n-The reviews for the unlimited pasta/soup lunches that occur seasonally should be taken into context:  those will not necessarily translate to an equivalent dinner experience because it is a very different setting and menu.

It's like nachos, but w fried pasta...it it quick though, as it can get a bit soggy after a while.\n\nSome people had the shrimp scampi, a dish definitely more fitted for somebody who trying to carbo-load before a marathon than an actual meal.

Olive Garden is more of a walk-in restaurant so no reservations. They have a nice seating area for maybe about 10 people to sit.\n\nService: When we got seated, our waiter was very friendly. He has the voice of an announcer which was pretty cool. He came by asking if we wanted to start off with drinks or appetizers (standard procedure at any restaurant) and he came back to check in if we were ready to order. During our meals, he would check in if we needed anything else and if we were satisfied with our food. Overall: service was great.\n\nFood: Breadsticks were good. I honestly don't see what the rave is about. I eat a lot of bread and this just wasn't to die for IMO. Probably because I had high expectations and it just didn't meet it. The salad was standard. Didn't expect much but they did give a big bowl of it.\n\nI got the Strawberry-Passion Fruit Limonata $3.50 and I really liked it. It might be a little too sweet for others but I think it was just perfect for me. It was a nice blend of strawberry and limonade.\n\nWe ordered an Italiano Sampler $12.99 for 3 choices. We got Calamari, Fried Mozzarella, and Toasted beef and pork ravioli. When we got our appetizer, it was not what we ordered. When I told our waiter, he went to check and brought out what we actually ordered. He asked if we wanted to keep or not. I bargained that if it was free, we'll keep it and he said sure!

The staff is very friendly. You can reserve a dining room if you plan to eat with a big group. The food is alright. \nYes, there is usually a ridiculously long line that makes me question some people's priorities. But then I remember why there's a wait. A lot of people shop at Stonestown with their friends and families. All of whom roll up in their extra large vans, minivans, SUVs, tour busses, what have you, and they all seem to want to eat in a sit-down restaurant with waiter service, because the food court just won't cut it. A lot of the younger crowd from several neighboring schools have appetites and time to spare. Then there are the out-of-towners who don't have an Olive Garden in their local neighborhood. I'm assuming most of them arrived just after watching a hunger-inducing Olive Garden commercial.\n \nSo you see, there's no reason to get mad at Olive Garden for having a long wait time. Well, sometimes I do notice that they quote an insane 45min -1hr estimate when there are empty tables. I don't know what's up with that. Poor communication? *Shrugs* I don't know.\n\nThe menu offers the usual Italian dishes - pastas & pizzas, and other typical mainstream dishes that chain restaurants offer. What do you expect? Chain restaurants cater to the masses and stick to the familiar, comfort dishes that most people have heard of. It's not meant to be innovative and exciting.\n\nOk, to be honest, the only things I like here are the breadsticks and the zuppa toscana soup. \n\nBreadsticks come warm and wrapped in a napkin. They're buttery soft and salty. Don't take breadsticks home. They always harden up like a rock. It's never fun trying to revive hard bread.\n\nZuppa Toscana Soup is spicy and creamy, with pieces of kale that give it a good texture, minced spicy Italian sausage, and potatoes that soak up the broth. Yum. Can I just order this to go?\n\nIf you've never had Italian food before (and I'm pretty sure most people have), then try the...\nTour of Italy - includes Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna, Fettucine Alfredo. \na taste of all 3 for under $20. All of them are okay.\n\nBut you have had Italian food before? Then skip it. Most of the dishes are typically around the same caliber. Just get the zuppa toscana soup and enjoy your seat with wheels and the villa-esque ambience as you gaze out the window into a view of the parking lot.\n\nI've been here once or twice during the off-peak times and it was quite alright. I don't think it's worth anyone's time to clutch a cumbersome square beeper and wait around an hour for the food here though.

I picked the salad and was given an enormous bowl of salad and three breadsticks to eat. Being the type of person who feels compelled to eat everything I'm given, I was still eating the salad (hadn't gotten to the breadsticks yet) when my entr\u00e9e was brought out. Now, I recalled that Starboard Value released a famous PowerPoint presentation that led to Olive Garden's parent company replacing its entire board of directors. In the presentation, they argued that the default portion sizes for the salad and breadsticks were too large, leading to food waste. They recommended that servers bring out a breadstick for each person at the table plus one additional breadstick. This rule was not followed, since I was given three breadsticks instead of two. I agree that this felt like an enormous amount of food before I even got to my entr\u00e9e.\n\nI searched \"Olive Garden\" on Google News to see how their business is doing since it seemed that they had not made all the recommended changes. I learned that an Olive Garden restaurant in New York is charging $400 for dinner tonight because they have a view of the New Year's Eve ball on Times Square. Well, I got lunch on New Year's Eve for about $15 including tip at this restaurant in suburban California.\n\nThe sandwich I ordered is interesting. It's chicken parmigiana, which is basically breaded chicken breast, served sandwiched inside a wider-than-standard breadstick. It comes with a side of fries. It almost looks like fries and a hot dog when you look at it. I'm not sure I really needed the fries after eating an enormous amount of salad and three breadsticks, and I'm not sure I really needed the sandwich bread after eating three breadsticks. If I go back, I will probably order a more traditional menu item.\n\nOne thing that was kind of peculiar is that there was a tablet-like device at my table for ordering food. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use it to order or if I was going to have a waiter. I was trying to figure out how to order a Dr. Pepper when a waitress came to take my order. A little bit awkward :). The only thing we ended up using it for was for the waitress to run my credit card at the end. She stood there while I picked how much to tip using the device after it presented me with a default, which was also a little awkward.\n\nOverall, I think the food is a good value here, especially for lunch. Unfortunately, I don't go to Olive Garden very often because between the salad, breadsticks, and entr\u00e9e, even without an appetizer, if you eat here often, you will probably get very fat.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the Chicken Parmigiana while the wifey and my two sons had the Four Cheese Pastachetti with Sauages.

Mom is a small eater, she said it was very good and now has 2-3 more meals from the leftovers. \n\nWe were asked if we wanted to order dessert- which we said yes and I purposely spoke loudly around the server to my mom- saying \"you want a scoop of ice cream on your birthday don't you?\"- again trying to remind the server that we had a birthday.

I've had three separate bad experiences at this establishment. I swear the first time it was the chicken piece gone M.I.A. the second was during their never ending pasta bowl. There was nothing never endind about that. They trick you with givin you the first bowl in a HUGE plate then totally downsizing on the next time around. We wanted to try all the combination and our waitress didn't seem too happy with that. The meatballs we added came as followed, 3 on the first serving, 2 on the second and I believe half on the third. The last time we went we had the two appetizer which consisted of the stuffed mushroom and the pork stuffed ravioli. The ravioli was super hard lol hella over fried. Frozen taste to me. The mushrooms were fine I give you that, but definitely a little on the greasy side. And dudes chicken Alfredo was like kid sized hahahaha it sucked for him but luckily I never finish all my meal since I fill up on bread which this time was only like brought out once! What the hell happened to the unlimited soup and salad, WTF, I know it;s a fucking recession but fuck you aint gotta be so cheap! Blargh.the food wasn't the business I regretted going back a third time and our waiter the last time actually stopped me in the middle of my order to go talk to an annoying random dude who was behind a glass window next to us waving at him! I swear idk what up with people nowadays.. when a bitch is hungry you gotta get me my shit.

She got it cooked medium and i like my meat medium rare so to me it was over cooked and hard but she seemed to like it. She was the only one who finished her meal but then again - she had less soup.\n\nOverall, i usually love my experience at Olive Garden but i guess because this was a busy Tuesday night, service was a bit lacking :\\ But I'll be back -", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-12-12"}, {"excerpts": ["Eggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  ", "It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  ", "She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  ", "It's a good combination. "], "author": "Nina M.", "review": "I go to Olive Garden now and then, once in a few months maybe longer.  However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.
