"], "author": "Cherylynn N.", "review": "Waitress: \"Can I see your IDs please?\"\n\nMy friends and I *eyebrows raised*: \"We're old...\"\n\nWaitress: \"You guys look YOUNG!\"\n\nMe (thinking to myself): \"YAY! Maybe I DO have a couple of years before I officially become 'Cougar Status'!\"\n\nLast night's dinner at Arang was like a trip down memory lane for me. In the early 2000s, this was the \"spot\" to come for underage drinking before/after karaoke. Past forward 10 years, it's good to know that they NOW check IDs b/c I absolutely do NOT condone underage drinking *eyes staring at the ceiling*. \n\nMy friends and I came to here at about 9:30 PM for a post-movie dinner/drinking. A table of four had just left, so we were promptly seated.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*Peach Soju (Pitcher - $24): It was ok. We used this to chase down the Chamisul.  The peach taste came from peach syrup from a can and not juice as it was a bit syrupy, sweet, and an odd yellow/orange color. If you like fruit sojus made w/ real fruit juice, check out the \"The Spot\" or \"Toyose\" in the Sunset. \n\n*Yogurt Soju (Small - $6): Better than the peach soju. It was creamy, sweet, and tart with a slight hint of alki flavor. \n\n*Chamisul (375 ml - $9.95): It was GOOD! The filtered sake was clean and refreshing. \n\n*Soondubuchigae (Tofu Soup - $8.95): I didn't have any, so I can't account for the taste.\n\n*Tteokbokki (Korean Rice Sticks -$9.95): Meh! The cylinder rice sticks were boiled and then stir-fried in gochujang (chili and fermented soybean) sauce. Because the rice sticks are very glutinous and wasn't cooked thoroughly, it was like chewing on stale gum. \n\n*Kalbi (BBQ Beef Shortribs - $16.95): YUMMY! The short ribs were perfectly cooked and were fatty, tender, and very flavorful from the soy, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, and sesame marinade. \n\n*Stir-fried Soon-dae (Korean Sausage - $12.95): Eck! This looked nothing as pictured on the menu nor on Yelp which displayed slices of fried sausages. What we received was sausages mixed with jap chae (vermicilli) and gochujang. Soon-dae is made of pig's intestines and stuffed with a mixture of pig's blood, rice, green onions, garlic, minced pork, and vermicelli. It's definitely an acquired taste. Because it's steamed first, it's has a mushy texture and an irony after taste. The jap chae was overcooked and soaking in the gochujang sauce. \n\n*Spam and Sausage Jeongol (Casserole - $22.95): YUMMY! Essentially, you get a big pot of kimchee soup filled with sliced rice cakes, kimchee, SPAM, hotdogs (not the soon-dae), green onions, topped with a block of raw ramen. After letting everything simmer on your table for 5 minutes, mix everything and you have a stew-like concoction. If you like kimchee tofu soup, ramen, and most importantly SPAM, you will LOVE this dish! The soup was rich, savory, and super spicy. And, the other ingredients depend on the cooking time, cook it shorter if you want al-dene ramen and rice cakes and longer if not. \n\n*Kimchee Fried Rice ($7.95): YUMMY! Spicy al-dente rice w/ cubes of spam and an egg over easy with a runny yolk....may I need to say more? I don't think so...\n\n*Bingsu (Korean Shaved Ice - $4.95): YUMMY! The shaved ice is topped with vanilla ice cream, red beans, bananas AND cinnamon toast crunch! It's basically a Korean version of Halo-halo. It's had a good combo of texture combos: cold, creamy, rich, sweet, and crunchy. This is a definite MUST order to cool down your tongue after devouring all the spicy dishes!\n\nSERVICE: \nFor an Asian restaurant, I thought it was pretty damn good. The waitress was very nice and friendly. She took our orders promptly, we got ALL of our food within 15 minutes, and she came to check on us every so often.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nHasn't changed a bit from the last time I went in 2001. They still have the same neon sign inside and out, bamboo plants, and hanging bubble lights. The dining area to the left has 4 tables that sits 4 people each and there's 3-4 booths on the right side that sits 4 people each. \n\nPARKING:\nArang is conveniently located in The Fillmore Shopping Plaza (Safeway, Popeyes) across from Panda Express and next to Subway, so you can park in the lot. \n\nAlthough some of their items were a Hit OR Miss, Arang's pricing and service has an edge over other Korean restaurant; e.g. Won Mi charges $25.95 for Kalbi while Arang charges just $16.95. So, if you're having a late night craving for Korean Food (closes at 2 AM everyday) and don't feel like dropping $$$, Arang is definitely a place to check out esp for their bento boxes under $10 which comes with a meat of your choice, jap chae, gyoza, rice, and salad!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-12"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered my usual bbq beef with tempura combo and also got the seafood pancake.

In the background, they are playing a mix of recent K-pop songs and Top 40 mainstream. \n\nFood here is amazing! I'm so happy that the food hasn't changed and possibly, may have gotten even better? It's been awhile so I can't remember but I also ordered new dishes this time.\n\nKIMCHI FRIED RICE - 3.5/5 Delicious but pretty standard. Came with a fried egg on top and the spam is really addicting. Wasn't super spicy so there wasn't really a strong kimchi taste but I enjoyed it since it was flavorful and I just love spam. \n\nBBQ PORK BULGOGI BENTO - 4/5 I was supposed to order the plate but I think I accidentally pointed to a bento. But the bento came with a decent amount of pork so it was all good. There was also 2 fried dumplings, salad and white rice as well as these potato tasting strips. Pork was really good and not overcooked or overly spicy. \n\nFRIED CHICKEN WITH SPICY SAUCE - 5/5 I don't know the actual name since we just referred to the picture hanging in the front but this was amazing Korean fried chicken. If only we had some beer to go along with it for chimaek. The chicken was tender and the breading was done so well. It was nice and crispy and just melted in my mouth. The spicy sauce was sooooooo good. I thought SanTung was my favorite for chicken wings but I was wrong. It's Arang. The chicken is also really meaty so you get big pieces! Not some dingy tiny little chicken wing. I think there were about ten pieces given that five of us each ate two wings.\n\nSLICED RICE CAKE STEW - 4/5 We thought it was going to be spicy for some reason but it wasn't... or maybe it was and we couldn't tell since we were using our bowls that had the spicy chicken. It was a white broth and it tasted a bit like seaweed/sesame. I thought it was a nice contrast to all the spicy foods we had earlier. The rice cake was nice and soft but what I really enjoyed was the broth. This may be a good hangover stew. \n\nOverall, it was a great meal and food + ambiance + service were all around excellent. Prices are around $10-13 for dinner which I find average for Korean food in SF (actually quite cheap since some places can go up to $15...)", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-10-25"}, {"excerpts": ["For the box, their spicy pork or bbq pork they called it, is a really good deal.

It has two gyoza, salad, japchae, rice and they also give you miso soup on the side. If you want other than pork, their galbi lunch box is also good as well.\n\nFor dinner, the rapokki is really good. It is a rice cakes with ramen and a bit spicy, sometimes it comes with fish cakes and sometimes not. Their casserole is also good and big, although it meant to be for two people, but i think you can feed three people with that. Their fried chicken is also good, but it takes a bit long to fry it. So you have to be patient a bit for that.\n\nThe service is really good as well.

In the early 2000s, this was the \"spot\" to come for underage drinking before/after karaoke. Past forward 10 years, it's good to know that they NOW check IDs b/c I absolutely do NOT condone underage drinking *eyes staring at the ceiling*. \n\nMy friends and I came to here at about 9:30 PM for a post-movie dinner/drinking. A table of four had just left, so we were promptly seated.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*Peach Soju (Pitcher - $24): It was ok. We used this to chase down the Chamisul.  The peach taste came from peach syrup from a can and not juice as it was a bit syrupy, sweet, and an odd yellow/orange color. If you like fruit sojus made w/ real fruit juice, check out the \"The Spot\" or \"Toyose\" in the Sunset. \n\n*Yogurt Soju (Small - $6): Better than the peach soju. It was creamy, sweet, and tart with a slight hint of alki flavor. \n\n*Chamisul (375 ml - $9.95): It was GOOD! The filtered sake was clean and refreshing. \n\n*Soondubuchigae (Tofu Soup - $8.95): I didn't have any, so I can't account for the taste.\n\n*Tteokbokki (Korean Rice Sticks -$9.95): Meh! The cylinder rice sticks were boiled and then stir-fried in gochujang (chili and fermented soybean) sauce. Because the rice sticks are very glutinous and wasn't cooked thoroughly, it was like chewing on stale gum. \n\n*Kalbi (BBQ Beef Shortribs - $16.95): YUMMY! The short ribs were perfectly cooked and were fatty, tender, and very flavorful from the soy, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, and sesame marinade. \n\n*Stir-fried Soon-dae (Korean Sausage - $12.95): Eck! This looked nothing as pictured on the menu nor on Yelp which displayed slices of fried sausages. What we received was sausages mixed with jap chae (vermicilli) and gochujang. Soon-dae is made of pig's intestines and stuffed with a mixture of pig's blood, rice, green onions, garlic, minced pork, and vermicelli. It's definitely an acquired taste. Because it's steamed first, it's has a mushy texture and an irony after taste. The jap chae was overcooked and soaking in the gochujang sauce. \n\n*Spam and Sausage Jeongol (Casserole - $22.95): YUMMY! Essentially, you get a big pot of kimchee soup filled with sliced rice cakes, kimchee, SPAM, hotdogs (not the soon-dae), green onions, topped with a block of raw ramen. After letting everything simmer on your table for 5 minutes, mix everything and you have a stew-like concoction. If you like kimchee tofu soup, ramen, and most importantly SPAM, you will LOVE this dish! The soup was rich, savory, and super spicy. And, the other ingredients depend on the cooking time, cook it shorter if you want al-dene ramen and rice cakes and longer if not. \n\n*Kimchee Fried Rice ($7.95): YUMMY! Spicy al-dente rice w/ cubes of spam and an egg over easy with a runny yolk....may I need to say more? I don't think so...\n\n*Bingsu (Korean Shaved Ice - $4.95): YUMMY! The shaved ice is topped with vanilla ice cream, red beans, bananas AND cinnamon toast crunch! It's basically a Korean version of Halo-halo. It's had a good combo of texture combos: cold, creamy, rich, sweet, and crunchy. This is a definite MUST order to cool down your tongue after devouring all the spicy dishes!\n\nSERVICE: \nFor an Asian restaurant, I thought it was pretty damn good. The waitress was very nice and friendly. She took our orders promptly, we got ALL of our food within 15 minutes, and she came to check on us every so often.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nHasn't changed a bit from the last time I went in 2001. They still have the same neon sign inside and out, bamboo plants, and hanging bubble lights. The dining area to the left has 4 tables that sits 4 people each and there's 3-4 booths on the right side that sits 4 people each. \n\nPARKING:\nArang is conveniently located in The Fillmore Shopping Plaza (Safeway, Popeyes) across from Panda Express and next to Subway, so you can park in the lot. \n\nAlthough some of their items were a Hit OR Miss, Arang's pricing and service has an edge over other Korean restaurant; e.g. Won Mi charges $25.95 for Kalbi while Arang charges just $16.95. So, if you're having a late night craving for Korean Food (closes at 2 AM everyday) and don't feel like dropping $$$, Arang is definitely a place to check out esp for their bento boxes under $10 which comes with a meat of your choice, jap chae, gyoza, rice, and salad!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-05-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The korean pancakes were cooked perfectly, the fish egg tofu soup was delicious and the korean sausage was PERFECTO!

The food isn't as good as what you'll get at a place like Meogeoboka or Ohganae but it's quite a lot cheaper and still tasty. Here's what I recommend here:\n\nSea food bi bim bap - actually very good even compared to other more expensive and nicer Korean restaurants\n\nBeef bone and potato casserole - tasty and spicy, it has chunks of beef on the bone, potato, sprouts, jalapeno, other green thing, in a spicy broth. If you order the large one it can be enough for 3-4 people no problem.\n\nSea food pancake \n\nMussel soup - I try to always end the night with this. It's so soothing and tasty, just mussels, white onions, green onions, jalapeno, salt and pepper. \n\nSoju cocktail - lemon one tastes the best for me\n\n \nI also really have a crush on the waitress working here on Saturdays. She's really cute and nice. My friends think she's a little old for me but I think it's ok because she's so friendly. So that's a plus! \n\nSo, I give it 4 stars because I don't think the food is really AMAZING like places in LA or Oakland or Korea House in Hayward, and the panchan is not really very good, but I always have a great time here and the food is good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-03-31"}, {"excerpts": ["i also like the mussel soup and the stirfried squid over noodles (it's all sauteed in this red chili sauce and accented with zucchini and onions), great over rice.\n\n"], "author": "Kimby T.", "review": "i've been coming to arang for almost 8 years now and it's one of the best places i like to eat.  \n\nno matter how hard crappy sucky stupid day at work, a meal here afterwards ALWAYS makes the whole day worth the struggle.\n\ni like the short rib box (which comes with shredded potatoes, chapche glass noodles, 2 potstickers, rice, romaine/thousand island salad.  the meat for the most part is pretty well marbled (sometimes too much) but tender and juicy and sooooo flavorful.\n\nthe potstickers here are the best in town.  stuffed with delicately seasoned pork and veggies, the skins are just the right thinness, not too gummy/doughy, served with a nice soy/chili/green onion dipping sauce.\n\nbi bim bap here is the bomb (rice, egg, veggies, beef or seafood or veggies served in a hot stone bowl), as is their accompanying bi bim bap sauce, sweet and spicy.\n\ni also like the mussel soup and the stirfried squid over noodles (it's all sauteed in this red chili sauce and accented with zucchini and onions), great over rice.\n\nand the dessert...  goodness only justifiable by actually having it live and in person.  (secret ingredient: ctc)\n\nservice can be slow since there's often only 1, sometimes 2 servers working the whole restaurant.  appetizer plate (kimchee, tofu, etc) is served only with the entrees, not the dinner boxes.\n\nthey play koit radio in the daytime and korean trance at night time!\n\nportions are the same lunch and dinner, just different prices.\n\nplus they're open til about 3am.", "rating": 5, "date": "2006-10-15"}], "crab soup": []}
