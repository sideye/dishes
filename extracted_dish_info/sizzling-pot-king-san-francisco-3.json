It's all about that steam getting all over ya face like a good facial. Not that kind of \"facial\", you pervs! \n\nThere's not really a shortage of shabu and hot pot places in SF but dry hot pot places? Since Celestial Flame closed, I don't know any restaurant in SF that solely serves this fiery Sichuan specialty. \n\nSo, say hello to Sizzling Pot King that took over the short-loved Thai fusion restaurant: Thoughts Style Cuisine) (https://www.yelp.com/biz/thoughts-style-cuisine-showroom-san-francisco!\n\nSizzling Pot King is a small chain (Sunnyvale, San Diego, Seattle) that serves dry hot pot consisting of meat and veggies with a myriad of chilies and spices that will light your toilet paper on fiyah! Don't worry, there's a non-spicy option. The good thing about dry hot pot is there's no steam so if you have cake face like me, you'll leave with your eyebrows intact and not melted off! \n\nMy coworker and I thought we were beating the lunch rush by arriving at Sizzling King Pot before 11:30 am but we didn't - it was popping! It was packed with Mandarin speaking customers which was a great sign. \n\nSince Sizzling Pot King is in soft opening mode, there's a limited menu. The only apps available are potstickers and mantou (steamed buns).\n\nFor Dry Hot Pot:\n*Choose your proteins (tons of choices): Lamb, pork, beef, rabbit, snails, frog, intestines, tripe, gizzards, tongue, or seafood (lobster, crab, crawfish) are just to name a few.\n\n*Choose your 3 size: Small ($11.99), Medium ($22.99), or Large ($32.99). The small is only available Monday - Thursday. For the large, you can choose two meats. \n\n*Choose your flavor: Hot & Sour, Garlic, Sweet & Sour, or Seafood. \n\n*Choose your spice level: Non-spicy, mild-spicy, medium-spicy, or very-spicy.\n\nAll dry hot pots come with fried potato, cauliflower, celery, and bean sprouts.\n\nYou can customize your dry hot pot with extra veggies, carbs (noodles)and other proteins like spam, sausages, and pig's blood for an extra $.99 to $3.99. \n\nI highly recommend ordering rice ($1.50/bowl) to help balance all the spicy goodness. \n\nNO MSG is used. \n\nMy coworker and I ordered the Large Dry Hot Pot w/ half beef tongue and half beef short ribs ($32.99):  http://bit.ly/2onZ0Ie. Flavor: garlic. Spice: medium-spicy. We added silk noodles ($1.99) which is yam noodles like Korean japchae.\n\nThe meat, noodle, and veggie medley was so good! The beef tongue was sliced thin and tender with a nice bite. Luckily, there was a good amount of beef tongue because the short ribs were all bones (boo!). The noodles and veggies were all cooked well with the proper texture. I loved the fried potatoes for a crunchy texture element. \n\nThe medium-spicy garlic flavor was on-point, aromatic with a good mala numbing spice. The large pot can feed 3-4 people but we couldn't stop digging in for more because of that addictive spice.\n\nFood service took a long time because a group of 20 rolled in before us which delayed the kitchen by 45 minutes. The staff was super apologetic and gave us several updates on when our order was coming. \n\nThey do have a note outside to let customers know orders may take longer than expected because they're in soft opening mode. Not going to dock them for service since they're managing customer expectations which I appreciate. \n\nIt's a small space so it's best for groups of 2-4 people.\n\nParking, well it's SF but it's not as tough in this area since there's not that many commercial businesses on the block. \n\nThere's nothing like Sizzling Pot King in the area so I think they're going to do really well in the hood.

Reminds me of the spicier dishes at some really good Sichuan restaurants in Chinatown.

This could be good or bad, depending on how much you like aromatic spices.  Of the default veggies, I really liked the fried potato chunks.  They did an awesome job of absorbing the chili oil.  The celery created a cooling contrast to the spicy sauce.  The sprouts and cauliflower were boring though.  I added some instant noodles for my carbs (instead of paying extra for a side of rice) and that was a delicious choice.  Loved how the chili oil really clung to each noodle.  Only downside was that the noodles were placed on the bottom and some were scorched then stuck to the pot partway through the meal.  I had mixed feelings about the beef short ribs.  They were delicious, but super awkward to eat.

I am surprised, however, at its unlikely replacement, a bustling Chinese dry pot restaurant that acknowledges the huge Asian youth populace living in the immediate area. I didn't see the regular Orpheum theater-going crowd or the wandering tourist traffic I usually see around the 'hood. It was packed with gaggles of giggling Asian girls in the booths and tables of bickering Asian couples, so I fit in just fine albeit longer in the tooth than everybody else.\n\nPots were indeed sizzling at most of the tables. I was seated in the middle of all the activity and tried to figure out what I could order on my own. In the evening, the only sizes they offer are the $22.99 Medium and the $32.99 Large Combo. The $11.99 Small is apparently offered just at lunch from Monday through Thursday.  Oh I see. When I asked the server if they had a vegetarian selection, she shook her head and told me to get the chicken. All by myself. (Don't wanna be) All by myself. So I ordered a Medium Grilled Cooked Snails in Garlic, medium spicy - that's the second hottest level on their heat meter (photo: http://bit.ly/2FY29af) and hoped for the best. It arrived post haste, and my goodness, it was a mass of sizzling food in a hot pot.\n\nThe snails were cooked tender and mixed with broccoli, bean sprouts, peppers, mushrooms, cauliflower, and cilantro in a heavy garlic sauce, and frankly the spice was not nearly as amped up as I was expecting. Even with all that food in front of my face, I needed some kind of side dish and went for the $1.99 Black Fungus, which presumptively came stir-fried in the hot pot itself and not as a separate item (photo: http://bit.ly/2FsEPna). The result was that the fungus was not providing the taste of freshness I was looking for to contrast the hot pot ingredients. Meanwhile, the gas-fueled flickering flame was starting to make me nervous. Lesson learned: Next time I'll bring my posse with me, but first, I have to hire a posse.

Since Celestial Flame closed, I don't know any restaurant in SF that solely serves this fiery Sichuan specialty. \n\nSo, say hello to Sizzling Pot King that took over the short-loved Thai fusion restaurant: Thoughts Style Cuisine) (https://www.yelp.com/biz/thoughts-style-cuisine-showroom-san-francisco!\n\nSizzling Pot King is a small chain (Sunnyvale, San Diego, Seattle) that serves dry hot pot consisting of meat and veggies with a myriad of chilies and spices that will light your toilet paper on fiyah! Don't worry, there's a non-spicy option. The good thing about dry hot pot is there's no steam so if you have cake face like me, you'll leave with your eyebrows intact and not melted off! \n\nMy coworker and I thought we were beating the lunch rush by arriving at Sizzling King Pot before 11:30 am but we didn't - it was popping! It was packed with Mandarin speaking customers which was a great sign. \n\nSince Sizzling Pot King is in soft opening mode, there's a limited menu. The only apps available are potstickers and mantou (steamed buns).\n\nFor Dry Hot Pot:\n*Choose your proteins (tons of choices): Lamb, pork, beef, rabbit, snails, frog, intestines, tripe, gizzards, tongue, or seafood (lobster, crab, crawfish) are just to name a few.\n\n*Choose your 3 size: Small ($11.99), Medium ($22.99), or Large ($32.99). The small is only available Monday - Thursday. For the large, you can choose two meats. \n\n*Choose your flavor: Hot & Sour, Garlic, Sweet & Sour, or Seafood. \n\n*Choose your spice level: Non-spicy, mild-spicy, medium-spicy, or very-spicy.\n\nAll dry hot pots come with fried potato, cauliflower, celery, and bean sprouts.\n\nYou can customize your dry hot pot with extra veggies, carbs (noodles)and other proteins like spam, sausages, and pig's blood for an extra $.99 to $3.99. \n\nI highly recommend ordering rice ($1.50/bowl) to help balance all the spicy goodness. \n\nNO MSG is used. \n\nMy coworker and I ordered the Large Dry Hot Pot w/ half beef tongue and half beef short ribs ($32.99):  http://bit.ly/2onZ0Ie. Flavor: garlic. Spice: medium-spicy. We added silk noodles ($1.99) which is yam noodles like Korean japchae.\n\nThe meat, noodle, and veggie medley was so good! The beef tongue was sliced thin and tender with a nice bite. Luckily, there was a good amount of beef tongue because the short ribs were all bones (boo!). The noodles and veggies were all cooked well with the proper texture. I loved the fried potatoes for a crunchy texture element. \n\nThe medium-spicy garlic flavor was on-point, aromatic with a good mala numbing spice. The large pot can feed 3-4 people but we couldn't stop digging in for more because of that addictive spice.\n\nFood service took a long time because a group of 20 rolled in before us which delayed the kitchen by 45 minutes. The staff was super apologetic and gave us several updates on when our order was coming. \n\nThey do have a note outside to let customers know orders may take longer than expected because they're in soft opening mode. Not going to dock them for service since they're managing customer expectations which I appreciate. \n\nIt's a small space so it's best for groups of 2-4 people.\n\nParking, well it's SF but it's not as tough in this area since there's not that many commercial businesses on the block. \n\nThere's nothing like Sizzling Pot King in the area so I think they're going to do really well in the hood.
