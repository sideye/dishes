If anyone is reading this during the week of Restaurant week (Jan 18- 29) first thing I have to mention is that the menu on the site is NOT the same as what they are serving in store! Hopefully they change that... but just a heads up, I actually think it's better because it includes more options of small plates and a choice of dessert.\n\nMy roommate and I (whom I'm sure you'll see her reviews of this place too ;) (shout to to you Marcie!) decided we had to finally try this place after hearing all about it and of course, realizing it was the best RW deal! So the two of us made a reservation and came here along with my boyfriend.\n\nA couple things to note about restaurant week: as a table you pick 3 small dishes, 3 main dishes and 2 desserts and you share with the table. The waitress will portion it between however many people you have. I think the best deal is coming with 2 people but in any case, the servers are really good at making sure there is enough food so even with a big group, I'm sure it would be great :)\n\nWe decided to pick the following:\nSmall Plates:\n- Red Beet and Cumin Soup\nThis was super good! Nicely spiced with a perfect bit of sweetness, this was like a gazpacho (except warm) or like a tomato soup, except with beets. Super smooth and luxuriously rich with a ton of amazing flavor. Definitely going to try and imitate it ourselves! It seems simple but so good and perfect to warm up your soul\n\n- Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad\nThis was nice--nothing to speak lengths about but it had lentils and a nice crunch from the mung bean. It was pretty refreshing overall, nice and light but also very filling. Ours came with only two small pieces of paneer and we each had a solid couple spoonfuls to try it. \n\n- Chennai Chicken\nOMG so bombass. This was super good, moist and delicious chicken (probably the thighs) and it was covered in a crust and deep fried. It came with this yummy yogurt marinade and all three of us could not stop eating it it was so good, The perfect little appetizer and a taste for all palates :P\n\nMain Dishes:\n- Shrimp Biryani\nThis was really good, a sort of fried rice mixture with really soft rice and a bunch of spices plus a couple of mix ins and some shrimp. We got maybe 4-5 pieces of shrimp and a good helping of rice. This was a great compliment to the meal and just an overall solid option.\n\n- Lamb Keema (Dosa)\nIn case you don't know, a dosa is almost like a mixture of a crepe and like a chip--it's fried on one side so that it's crispy and the other side is a little bit doughy but overall, the dosa at Dosa is pretty thin--great as like a cripsy and flour tortilla in one or a one sided crispy injera (yea, poor description but the closest I can think of!). You'll fill it with sauces, and mixings, just as you would like a taco or crepe or like Injera (ethiopian pancake). Our dosa came with this really nice spiced lamp mixture with some potatoes and on the sides we also got this like coconut green sauce, a spicy red sauce, and a big bowl of this reddish orange curry. Overall it was delicious, especially just mixing everything together!\n\n- Organic Mushroom and Arugula Uttapam\nThis was basically like a pancake--it reminded me a lot of a vietnamese pancake or a part pancake, part omlette-y crepe. It was filled with delicious mushrooms and truffle oil and topped with fresh arugula. This also came with the chutneys and assorted dips which really complimented the dish. We described it as kind of like a pizza pancake aha\n\nDessert:\n- Pistachio Barfi\nThis was a decadant little chocolate sort of cake. So good.... layers of cashew milk fudge with pistachios, ganache and all sorts of goodies layered into a perfect little cake. Its a small serving but so rich that we barely finished it given the small piece we recieved!\n\n- Mango Sorbet\nThe best kind of sorbet period. You really can't go wrong with this, it's the besttttt\n\nAnd that's that! At $42 a person and then additional tax and tip, it was a TON of food and RW was a great way to taste so much of their menu without breaking the bank, since this place is normally pretty high end. The food is really outstanding though and I know I would definitely be back and recommend this to friends. We were all STUFFED and I'm so happy I took advantage of this deal.

Upon entering, we were greeted with a friendly hostess and the amazing smell of Indian spices, a nice comforting feeling on one of those super chilly San Francisco nights.

All served with some tomato, sambar, and coconut chutneys for dipping.  We all agreed the white truffle masala dosa was the highlight or all the dishes.

She began to explain all the different dishes they had and how I'm supposed to be ordering one of those other dishes...ok, we get it, not our first time dining there nor was I finished ordering. My uncle had to chime in and said to her \"maybe let us finish ordering first and then make suggestions?\" She still didn't shut up about the different options and she was adamant about how we should order a curry dish. Well maybe if she stopped rambling, she would have known we were ordering 3 of the curry dishes she kept talking about. After 5+ minutes of her talking nonstop, we finally continued our order. I think she realized her mistake and quickly took our order and walked away. Never saw her again. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing at that point. \n\nOnto the food. So delicious!! For the dosas, I recommend the paper dosa and truffle masala dosa. The paper dosa is huge! Definitely enough for 6 people.

They were very light and crisp, and speckled with cumin. Magically delicious! It was a great way to test out the chutney sampler. The fire broth was lentil-y, spicy and good as well.

I tried a dime sized drop - despite the hotness, it also tastes sweet. \n\nMy Mysore Dosa was delicious!! Of course, I do have an unhealthy love for potatoes. The crepe itself was big, slightly chewy, and partially filled with creamy spiced potatoes with onions and cashews. I think I would've preferred less dough because it was folded so a big portion was not filled with anything. I ended up using the Sambar (lentil dipping soup) more than the Tomato and fresh Coconut Chutney. All three came with the Dosa for dipping. The Paneer and Peas Dosa was wrapped like a burrito, and cut so you could see the filling. The cheese looked like scrambled eggs, so I kept thinking I was going to eat eggs and peas. It was also tasty and not too pea-y. \n\nOverall the service was attentive and very helpful, everything was delicious, but just slightly pricey.

We knew the restaurant was going to be a huge success because the food was so amazing. We loved it. We probably went at least 30 times and when Dosa Fillmore opened we frequented that one because it was closer to where we live. We didn't think Fillmore was quite as good as Valencia but it was still excellent.\nFor some unknown reason we stopped going some years ago. No one reason in particular, I think we just got excited about other cuisines and places and lost interest.\nWe went back to the original Valencia location last night with a couple friends. I knew exactly what I wanted to order and was pleased most if not everything I used to love is still on the menu. A few highlights:\n\n- Lamb sliders. These things were awesome. Heat level is INSANE. I applaud the chef for having the nerve to put as much heat into those things as they do. I nearly choked at first as I inhaled a tiny chunk of the lamb and the heat seared the back of my throat. All good. That's the kind of burn anyone who likes spicy food should love. The quality of the lamb which was finely ground was also superb. \n- Chennai chicken. This is always good, however it used to be better. The chicken used to just explode on the palate with various spices and heat, and the accompanying yogurt sauce cooled it perfectly. Now it is more like a standard fare chicken and the sauce is kind of boring. Disappointed but still pretty good.\n- Dahi Vada. This one was the major letdown of the evening. This dish used to be spectacular. It was served in a nice size bowl with a spiderweb thread of yogurt and sauce that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven. Now it is served in one of these gourmet bowls that really allow them to give you half as much and gone is the intricate artwork on top. It still tastes similar but nowhere close to how awesome it used to be. I really think Anjan should restore this dish to its former glory. It was one of the best dishes I've ever encountered anywhere.\n- Corn Poriyal. Very good, refreshing corn spiced perfectly which was a nice break from the heavy flavors everywhere else.\n- White Truffle Dosa. Spot on. As I'd expect from all of the dosas, this one was just as I remembered it and 100% delicious and awesome. \n- Caramelized onion Uttapam. Very good but I didn't think it was very unique. Just ok.\n- Channa Batura. Pretty close to how I remember it and it was usually one of the dishes we loved the most. It still comes out with a gargantuan wheat bread ready to explode with steam in the middle and the divine chickpeas. It is still awesome. I think it used to be a smidgen better but it is still wonderful. \n- We ordered a few rice dishes and a veggie curry also which I thought were good but not the highlight of the meal so I won't go into great detail. \n\nI hope this provides a good review for your consideration of Dosa.

We knew the restaurant was going to be a huge success because the food was so amazing. We loved it. We probably went at least 30 times and when Dosa Fillmore opened we frequented that one because it was closer to where we live. We didn't think Fillmore was quite as good as Valencia but it was still excellent.\nFor some unknown reason we stopped going some years ago. No one reason in particular, I think we just got excited about other cuisines and places and lost interest.\nWe went back to the original Valencia location last night with a couple friends. I knew exactly what I wanted to order and was pleased most if not everything I used to love is still on the menu. A few highlights:\n\n- Lamb sliders. These things were awesome. Heat level is INSANE. I applaud the chef for having the nerve to put as much heat into those things as they do. I nearly choked at first as I inhaled a tiny chunk of the lamb and the heat seared the back of my throat. All good. That's the kind of burn anyone who likes spicy food should love. The quality of the lamb which was finely ground was also superb. \n- Chennai chicken. This is always good, however it used to be better. The chicken used to just explode on the palate with various spices and heat, and the accompanying yogurt sauce cooled it perfectly. Now it is more like a standard fare chicken and the sauce is kind of boring. Disappointed but still pretty good.\n- Dahi Vada. This one was the major letdown of the evening. This dish used to be spectacular. It was served in a nice size bowl with a spiderweb thread of yogurt and sauce that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven. Now it is served in one of these gourmet bowls that really allow them to give you half as much and gone is the intricate artwork on top. It still tastes similar but nowhere close to how awesome it used to be. I really think Anjan should restore this dish to its former glory. It was one of the best dishes I've ever encountered anywhere.\n- Corn Poriyal. Very good, refreshing corn spiced perfectly which was a nice break from the heavy flavors everywhere else.\n- White Truffle Dosa. Spot on. As I'd expect from all of the dosas, this one was just as I remembered it and 100% delicious and awesome. \n- Caramelized onion Uttapam. Very good but I didn't think it was very unique. Just ok.\n- Channa Batura. Pretty close to how I remember it and it was usually one of the dishes we loved the most. It still comes out with a gargantuan wheat bread ready to explode with steam in the middle and the divine chickpeas. It is still awesome. I think it used to be a smidgen better but it is still wonderful. \n- We ordered a few rice dishes and a veggie curry also which I thought were good but not the highlight of the meal so I won't go into great detail. \n\nI hope this provides a good review for your consideration of Dosa. If you like Indian food you will not be disappointed with Dosa, just know that technically it used to be better. You still can't go wrong here though.

It was a momentous occasion for Elite and soon-to-be-Elite members to break bread at Dosa. We helped Manabu to celebrate his second month anniversary as a Yelper, scheduled a New Year's lunch with Tom R, and for the rest I can tell a story about each person based on our interpersonal relationships and from following their reviews. As people took turns to stress the inclusive nature of this event compared to those that required the Elite status, I glanced across the table and knew exactly how we became friends through Yelp and the relationship we have developed over time regardless of age, profession, educational background, and other visible markers that often set us apart in this divided world. \n\nAlthough Dosa wasn't initially our first choice, it turned out to be a fabulous venue for such an event. From wall to wall the place was clean, spacious, and filled with fresh vibrant orange and brown d\u00e9cor with a good mix of natural and artificial lighting. Seated by the corner right behind the bar, our group had plenty of room and privacy to work with. We started off with a slew of appetizers to share and later each person had their main course individualized.\n\nDahi batata puri: Small hallow crispy breads that came with yogurt, potatoes, mint, and tamarind chutneys. It was a one-bite sensation with the entire bread collapsing to let the fillings run wild. It was decent.\n\nDahi vada: A beautifully presented yogurt with tamarind and mint smothered on top of lentil dumplings. Some people didn't discover the lentil dumplings at first since they were well hidden but I thought the dish was okay. I'm not too big on dishes served chilled and it was a bit heavier in taste than the rest.\n\nBhel puri: Amy C told me that this dish tasted like a mix of instant noodles and spices and I have to agree in terms of its texture. It came with an exciting mix of mango, potatoes, tomatoes, onions and other seasoning and it was crunchy and delightful.\n\nPani puri: Another set of small crispy breads where we had to manually poke a hole in the middle and fill it with spoons of chickpeas, mung beans, and potatoes before filling mint and tamarind water to capacity. I probably like this appetizer the most as the fillings had a lot of substance while the mint and tamarind water brought a refreshing sour and mint balance to bring it all together. Yum yum.\n\nFor the main course, I had the chicken curry special and it was fresh and creamy without it being unnecessarily oily. Chicken pieces were generous with lots of flavor and seasoning. The slight kick added flavor to a generous serving of coconut basmati rice. I thought the rice was not as good as the one at Burma SuperStar, but it was still a powerful sweet-spicy combination. Additionally, I also had a taste of Amy C's eggs dosa which is what they specialize in brunch. The eggs were nicely scrambled with tomatoes and onions with a fluffy external layer of savory dosa to keep the fillings together. Her side of coconut and tomatoes chutney was mildly spicy and creamy delicious.\n\nService was excellent. Our water was constantly refilled and our server Lindsay was very knowledgeable and attentive. Not sure what we had worked out with them prior to lunch, but they also charged us for cutting the Saint Honore cake and plates which was an unexpected detail to note. From a personal standpoint, I have to agree with Tom R and Bradley N that their food could be spicier, but I also saw several people at the end of my table who really struggled with what they were having. This said, I thought their culinary purpose was the necessary medium for a large group like ours. \n\nFinally, I would remiss without thanking Maybelline C for organizing this event. May and her husband Marc have been fabulous to work with and it was troubling to learn about her illness on the morning of the lunch. Despite her illness, her efforts to coordinate up to the moment of the event were significant in making it a success. With May being the face of our current and future events, I have no doubt that people will continue to gather and redefine for themselves what Yelp is really all about. As for Dosa, I would absolutely love to return for your brunch items. 4.5 stars for the overall experience. \n\nHave a Yelpalicious 2010, everyone!", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-12-29"}, {"excerpts": ["The Dahi Vada is to die for.

Although it's in the Mission area, it's more in the \"charming neighbourhood, restaurant row\" area than the traditionally grimy/grungy image associated with Mission.\n\nBetween the three of us, we tasted idlis, vada, plain utthappam, the spiced mung salad and the habanero/mango masala dosa. The first three were as expected, and props for the texture of the utthappam, which was just the right balance between soft and crispy. The mung salad was unbelievably delicious and has me tempted to try to recreate it at home. Only beef is that the portion size is a little small for the $9 price tag.\n\nNow, a word to the wise for those foolish enough to brave the habanero dosa. Even though I was given a taste of the chutney and knew what kind of heat was in store, I naively thought that my tongue would be able to withstand the assault of the habanero-mango sauce with the hot masala and the hot sambar. Alas, I could not finish the delicious dosa without two glasses of water and three cups of yogurt. Seriously, if you think you have a high spice tolerance, beware. I'm glad I tried it but am more than happy to experiment with something a little less fiery the next time. The sambar and chutneys were tasty, with just the right amount of tang and spice.\n\nFor dessert, we split the rasmalai, which was surprisingly not cloyingly sweet. I was tempted to try the Tea-ramisu (with a chocolate-chai sauce, chai-infused rum and paneer), but will save it for next time.\n\nThe service was the only letdown - they forgot the dahi vada we ordered and took much longer than expected to bring the food out, given that the restaurant was not packed.

Being avid Indian food fanatics, we agreed on Dosa and we were both blown away.  \n\nDosa is not like any other Indian food we've had before.  Almost every Indian restaurant we've had up until now has focused primarily on Tandoori BBQ, Curry, Basmati, Naan, etc. You won't find any of those at Dosa...  They specialize in South Indian cuisine, which centers on Dosa flat breads and Uttapans.  \n\nWe started with the Dahi Vada appetizer which was superb.  It was this beautifully presented dish of Lentil dumplings infused with organic yogurt, tamarind, mint, and other spices.  It tasted wonderful; very flavorful and a moderate sized portion for two people.\n\nNext was our Spinach and Paneer Jumbo Prawn curry with coconut rice - the one dish that reminded me of other Indian restaurants I've had before.  Essentially it was an Aloo Palak dish with shrimp.  It was OK, better than fast food Indian places such as Naan & Curry.  However, it wasn't as fresh and tasty as Sultan's spinach Curry.  Out of everything we ordered, I was least impressed with this dish.\n\nOur last dish was a classic Masala Dosa.  We've never had Dosa's before so we didn't know which one to order.  Thus our decision to start with the Classic (apparently the tried and truest).  I was amazed at how large this was.  The plate itself was huge, and our half moon shaped Dosa spilled out at least six inches past either side of the plate.  It was filled with spiced Potatoes and cashews, similar to what you'd find in a Samosa.  The Dosa's come with 3 dipping sauces, all of which are delectable.  One is a creamy one that tastes pretty garlicky; another is one that reminds me of a vegetable soup.  The third one, my favorite, was a fresh tomato based puree that was cold and reminded me of a blended Salsa.\n\nOur dinner was fantastic and was a pleasant introduction to South Indian Cuisine.  We will definitely be back again and again to try the other Dosa's and Uttapans that all sounded amazing.

The atmosphere is busy cool but the noise levels made me feel like I was a grumpy old man. \r\n\r\nFor my personal gustatory pleasures, I prefer driving to  Cupertino or Fremont for my carb happy pleasures of dosas, idly, uttapams and sambhar. There is no bettter guilty pleasure than that warm cocunut chutney feeling when you look around and see that  you're the only white guy in the joint, and the kids are staring at you wondering how you discovered their secret.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you're not feeling the scenic 280,  Dosa is a good choice for South Indian,  so enjoy the tighty whitey waiters and the chitter chatter boom box.  FYI, for another version of authentic ethnic cuisine done well in a cool upscale style, check out either Limon down the street on Valencia.\r\n\r\nDosa is new to the scene, so I'll be checking back to watch their progress. As with all new endeavors, it takes time to work out the kinks in the curry.", "rating": 4, "date": "2006-02-18"}, {"excerpts": ["non-fishy....the Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings with yogurt) was hella good ", "and I'm generally not into cold dishes or dumplings to be honest.

Friday night I was finally able to team up with my partner in crime Jen O. for an early dinner and we both agreed on Dosa.\n\nWe decided we would try the 4 course tasting menu, because the portions are a bit smaller and since there was two of us we ordered two things from each course and shared. Plus, at $30 per person, this is pretty reasonable. \n\nWe also did the wine pairing and shared, so for $16 each we got to sample six wines. I don't recommend the wine pairing though, because though the wines are actually quite good and so is the food, The wine does not enhance the flavor of the food because the spice wipes out the wine.

", "The bowl of yogurt we saw actually contained the small lentil dumplings underneath the tamarind and mint design along the top surface.  "], "author": "Jim W.", "review": "Upon arriving at Dosa on a Thursday at 6 pm, we were seated at the bar until the rest of our party arrived.  The bartender casually introduced some of his favorite dishes to us while we waited.  As folks trickled in, our party became complete and we sat down to a half-full restaurant around 6:30.  By the time we ordered, the restaurant was full and pleasantly noisy with spirited conversations around appetizers and entrees.\n\nDosa specializes in southern Indian food, which is a fairly dramatic departure to what most of us are more familiar with.  That being said, there are some recognizable items on the menu -- things that read \"curry\" or \"lamb\" or \"masala\".  However, the stars of the menu are the namesake of the restaurant: the dosa (and its cousin, the uttapam).  Our server was very enthusiastic in explaining just exactly what these were -- the dosa is a thin rice crepe, while the uttapam is a thicker pancake, both of which can be ordered with a variety of fillings or toppings.\n\nBut first, the appetizers.  We started off with the Chennai Chicken (fried boneless organic chicken marinated in organic yogurt with coriander and cumin).  Boneless buffalo wings from India?  Perhaps, but the mild spices were a surprise, which I appreciated since I could actually taste the chicken, which was tender, moist, and flavorful.  We also had the Dahi Vada, which confused us a bit when it arrived at the table.  The bowl of yogurt we saw actually contained the small lentil dumplings underneath the tamarind and mint design along the top surface.  Not only were the lentil dumplings great, but the leftover yogurt went very well with our entrees also.\n\nI am a huge fan of paneer, so I was immediately drawn to the Peas and Paneer Dosa.  My rice crepe came filled with shredded farmer's cheese, peas ,and cilantro.  While the portion size was relatively small, there was just enough food to satisfy me without making me feel bloated -- as I often do at Indian restaurants!  The peas and paneer were also very subtly spiced, allowing all of the main ingredients to shine for themselves.  The dosa and uttapam dishes come with sambar (a lenti dipping soup) and two chutneys (tomato and coconut).  The tomato chutney was a particularly good accompaniment to my peas and paneer lentil.\n\nWe also ordered an uttapam topped with a masala containing potatoes, onions, and cashews.  The uttapam was a more substantial pancake, which made it more integral to the taste and texture of the dish.  If I were to return to this restaurant, I would definitely order the uttapam over the dosa.  Another masala we tried was the Channa Bhatura, which contained garbonzo beans witha choice of  an oversized puffy wheat bread or a vegan poori (fried bread made from whole grain durum wheat).  We assumed that the non-vegan wheat bread would not be fried, since it wasn't mentioned specifically in the menu, but it came to the table glistening with oil.  A bread was definitely required for the masalas, but perhaps a baked option would have been more appreciated here.  Nonetheless, both of these masalas were great dishes with an obvious taste departure from the more commonly known northern Indian cuisine -- I suppose everything simply tasted milder.\n\nTo round things out, we also ordered a more familiar Tamil vegetable curry with cauliflower, green beans, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes over coconut rice.  This dish was unoffensive and rather plain -- it was, once again, very subtle in spicing, but the vegetables by themselves weren't particularly punchy in flavor, leaving a bit of a vacuum of taste with each bite.  The subtlety of spices in the other dishes were to their advantage, but not so well here.  Then again, this vegetable curry isn't terribly adventurous when it comes to southern Indian cuisine, so I'm not surprised that I wasn't terribly impressed by it.\n\nI suppose the lesson here is to understand the motivation for this restaurant.  Do not treat it like your local lunch buffet Indian restaurant where your tandoori chicken is haphazardly perched over a bed of biryani.  Instead, embrace the individual flavors of the dosas and the uttapams and let the ingredients speak loudly with undertones of Indian spices.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-08-02"}, {"excerpts": ["My favorite was the dahi vada (lentil dumplings with yogurt and mint sauce) - not only beautiful, but very tasty."], "author": "Lindsey S.", "review": "When I hear the words \"Indian food\" I usually go running, which explains why it took two attempts from a friend before I agreed to give Dosa a try.

My date and I were almost 40 minutes early and our host was happy to seat us right away.\n\nWe both ordered the prefix menu;a 4 course meal with 4 or 5 options to select from at each course. We also went with the wine pairings for the prefix; a generous 1/2 glass of wine with the first three courses.  Between the two of us we were able to enjoy 8 different items and 6 wines.\n\nThe waiter was friendly and warm, personable, and knowledgeable of the food and the ingredients as well as the wines.  The food was a bit hotter in flavor than I was used to for Indian (I was certainly feeling it the next day), but the quality was excellent.  The atmosphere was decent; the wall colors were as spicy as the food, the light fixtures were a bit unattractive (I'm a lighting snob, so I'm a bit harsh).  The seats were comfortable, especially after having all that wine, but I thought it was a little tightly packed (I could follow my neighbors conversations too closely).  \n\nA highlight of the meal was the Dahi Vada, which I thought was one of the most attractive dishes I've ever seen at an Indian restaurant.\n\nDosa was by far the best Indian restaurant that I have come across in San Francisco and I would certainly dine there again.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-02-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Got the Dahi Vada to start, which was a cold dish...", "lentil dumplings topped with a mint-yogurt sauce...very tasty and unlike anything I've ever had before.

I thought maybe I should visit again, but then I realized that I have way too many restaurants left on my list to hit up before I leave SF...and that I am, in fact, narcissistic enough to think that my review might serve some use in this Yelp world. So here you go:\n\n\"Congratulations, Dosa! You have just made it into the Overrated Club!\" I wanted so much to like Dosa - hip Mission locale, cool decor, vibrant energy, courteous and down-to-earth service (both while waiting for our table for four and during the meal). However, there was a lot of the experience that just seemed a little bit \"off.\" Our server was very enthusiastic about telling us his favorites within each section of the *overwhelmingly* large menu. Since he seemed so friendly and we were so indecisive, my friend and I got into our \"assault the waiter with questions\" mode. He handled it well, but when we asked what the difference between fresh corriander and cilantro was, he seemed flustered and was unable to find an answer for us. I think that we scared him because after that we never saw him again. The service thereafter was moderately good, though it took some effort to flag down more water.\n\nOh well, it's probably best because some of his suggestions were real disappointments, and I am a terrible liar. Our starter, the Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings topped with yogurt, tamarind, and mint) sounded intriguing and unique to Dosa. Unfortunately, the presentation and the texture of the dish elicited a unanimous verdict, \"It's like 7 layer bean dip.\" Not appetizing unless it is Super Bowl Sunday. For our entrees, I had the Chatni Masala dosa, which we all agreed was the best pick of the table; it would have been nice though if the waiter had confirmed whether it would be made with the eggplant or the ridge gourd. The dosa was very large (~12 inches across), with an ample serving of a creamy baby eggplant chutney spread encased in a wonderfully crisp crepe. The other entrees included the Channa Bhatura (a flat-tasting chick pea masala served with an awesome puffy wheat bread), some vegetable curry that was so inspirational and muddled in flavor that I can't remember anything else worth mentioning, and the South Indian Moons. The South Indian Moons (chef's choice of five uttapams - aka open faced dosas), in particular, sounded too good to be true - and it was. It's a classic case of sacrificing quality for quantity - the half-dollar sized uttapams were all dry and none of their toppings was able to stand out (I enjoyed the paneer & peas most, probably because I am a cheesehound like that).\n\nDespite how terribly loud it was, we were able to carry on a lively discussion about NYC vs. Bay Area lifestyle and dining (p.s. I'm always up for this conversation...).

It's a rare occasion that one receives service like this and I will happily return to Dosa knowing that the owners will take the time to reach out to individual patrons and address their grievances, esp. on the VERY DAY that the review was posted. If only more businesses here on Yelp did the same...was enough to change my 3-stars back to the 4 I had originally wanted to give them.***\n---------------\nIt pains me to write anything less than an optimal review, but I've been frustrated lately by their seating policies. They require everyone to be there before seating us, which - in the case of last night - meant that six people waited for 10 minutes at the bar while our assigned table sat vacant. Frustrated, esp. when we'd been on our feet all day...would have liked to sit and relax.\n\nThe only other frustration came with a mix-up with the check - took us over 15 minutes to get out of there, and they still mis-charged the ONE credit card we had. They remedied this by giving us the difference in cash, but it was still a bit annoying.\n\nThat said.\n\nThe food here is consistently tasty; for those who aren't familiar with South Indian, it's mainly vegetarian and quite different from your \"traditional\" Indian (Naan 'n Chutney-esque restaurants that you see on every corner.) Their Uttapam and Dosa are both fantastic, whichever variety you choose, and I tried the calamari appetizer which tasted like Christmas. (Must have been the cloves, and note I *LIKE* things that taste like Christmas!) We always get the beautifully presented Dahi Vada and literally have to get more papadom  to scoop out the last morsels of this tastiness.\n\nI will certainly return to Dosa and hope that they reconsider their seating policy for large groups (or are more willing to make an exception for \"regular\" customers like ourselves) as this restaurant would clearly earn at least 4 stars if not for that service snafu.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-01-31"}, {"excerpts": ["the pani puri and dahi vada were amazing.

You could go here without worrying that your date would be overdressed, and as someone who is perfectly happy eating off a thali and even appreciates something Bollywood playing up on the wall, and generally prefers typical \"ethnic\" joints for being relatively casual (and cheap) as well as relatively tasty, I very much enjoyed a more upscale, polished environment for a change.  Going here felt like a special occasion, but it was still comfortable.\n\nSecond, the food is actually pretty good.   That it is more expensive to eat here than the alternatives is no surprise.  You are paying for more than food.   And really, it isn't expensive when you consider that.  And it isn't like you are eating something from Chat Cafe, prettied up, either.  The food just wasn't mind blowing or anything.  Maybe if I'd made it to Vik's or Udupi, I'd be less forgiving, but it isn't like I haven't had better elsewhere.

The rasam (which they served as soup) was so spicy that some tamilian friends of mine at the next table over called it \"Too Authentic.\"  I personally found the sambar (with either the capcicum or the okra) to be a better choice either as a starter or as a dipping sauce.  The dosas were better than the uttapam (which I think is still attempting to fit into the western style eating mode, instead of the indian style \"Tiffin\" mode.

Typically, outside of the South Bay, North Indian restaurants outnumber South Indian ones by at least 10:1.  And usually the South Indian restaurants that exist are cheap (read: poor ambience/bad service/generally ghetto), vegetarian and only cater to Indians.  As such, Dosa is a breath of fresh air and really destroys all of the stereotypes generally attributed to South Indian restaurants --- plus it's in SF.  I've been 4 times and have really enjoyed my experiences each and every time.  For apps, I'm a big fan of the dahi vada.  The vada is crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside and probably as well-presented as I've ever seen the dish, even in India.  The accompanying yogurt and chutneys match well with the vada.  I don't really care for the Chennai chicken --- it's a little too greasy and flavorless.  The sada paper dosa is my favorite dosa.  Even my mom, who is universally considered the best dosa cook in my hometown, really likes them.  The sada paper is buttery and crispy and perfect for dipping in sambar and chutney.  I don't really care for masala-filled dosas but everyone I've been to the restaurant with seems to like them.  I really like the channa bhatura as well.  It's pretty rare to find a restaurant that serves good bhatura.  Also, Dosa's plates are actually big enough to hold the bhatura, which is a big plus in my book.  Once upon a time, I went to Vik's and was utterly disgusted to see some woman eating her bhatura directly off the nasty table.  (Btw, do any Indian people actually like Vik's?  I think that place is perhaps the most overrated Indian restaurant ever.  I understand it's cheap, but it's also disgusting.  The quality has seriously gone down hill in the last 5 years or so.)  Anyway... Dosa also has some quality meat dishes.  The tamil lamb curry is great.  It's a little greasy, but very tasty and one of the better South Indian meat dishes I've had in a while.  The prawn coconut masala is pretty good too.  The restaurant also has a good selection of beer and sake cocktails.  Overall, I'm a big fan of the restaurant, but the lack of a reservation policy bugs me (actually, I think they may take them for parties of 5 or more).

If anyone is reading this during the week of Restaurant week (Jan 18- 29) first thing I have to mention is that the menu on the site is NOT the same as what they are serving in store! Hopefully they change that... but just a heads up, I actually think it's better because it includes more options of small plates and a choice of dessert.\n\nMy roommate and I (whom I'm sure you'll see her reviews of this place too ;) (shout to to you Marcie!) decided we had to finally try this place after hearing all about it and of course, realizing it was the best RW deal! So the two of us made a reservation and came here along with my boyfriend.\n\nA couple things to note about restaurant week: as a table you pick 3 small dishes, 3 main dishes and 2 desserts and you share with the table. The waitress will portion it between however many people you have. I think the best deal is coming with 2 people but in any case, the servers are really good at making sure there is enough food so even with a big group, I'm sure it would be great :)\n\nWe decided to pick the following:\nSmall Plates:\n- Red Beet and Cumin Soup\nThis was super good! Nicely spiced with a perfect bit of sweetness, this was like a gazpacho (except warm) or like a tomato soup, except with beets. Super smooth and luxuriously rich with a ton of amazing flavor. Definitely going to try and imitate it ourselves! It seems simple but so good and perfect to warm up your soul\n\n- Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad\nThis was nice--nothing to speak lengths about but it had lentils and a nice crunch from the mung bean. It was pretty refreshing overall, nice and light but also very filling. Ours came with only two small pieces of paneer and we each had a solid couple spoonfuls to try it. \n\n- Chennai Chicken\nOMG so bombass. This was super good, moist and delicious chicken (probably the thighs) and it was covered in a crust and deep fried. It came with this yummy yogurt marinade and all three of us could not stop eating it it was so good, The perfect little appetizer and a taste for all palates :P\n\nMain Dishes:\n- Shrimp Biryani\nThis was really good, a sort of fried rice mixture with really soft rice and a bunch of spices plus a couple of mix ins and some shrimp. We got maybe 4-5 pieces of shrimp and a good helping of rice. This was a great compliment to the meal and just an overall solid option.\n\n- Lamb Keema (Dosa)\nIn case you don't know, a dosa is almost like a mixture of a crepe and like a chip--it's fried on one side so that it's crispy and the other side is a little bit doughy but overall, the dosa at Dosa is pretty thin--great as like a cripsy and flour tortilla in one or a one sided crispy injera (yea, poor description but the closest I can think of!). You'll fill it with sauces, and mixings, just as you would like a taco or crepe or like Injera (ethiopian pancake). Our dosa came with this really nice spiced lamp mixture with some potatoes and on the sides we also got this like coconut green sauce, a spicy red sauce, and a big bowl of this reddish orange curry. Overall it was delicious, especially just mixing everything together!\n\n- Organic Mushroom and Arugula Uttapam\nThis was basically like a pancake--it reminded me a lot of a vietnamese pancake or a part pancake, part omlette-y crepe. It was filled with delicious mushrooms and truffle oil and topped with fresh arugula. This also came with the chutneys and assorted dips which really complimented the dish. We described it as kind of like a pizza pancake aha\n\nDessert:\n- Pistachio Barfi\nThis was a decadant little chocolate sort of cake. So good.... layers of cashew milk fudge with pistachios, ganache and all sorts of goodies layered into a perfect little cake. Its a small serving but so rich that we barely finished it given the small piece we recieved!\n\n- Mango Sorbet\nThe best kind of sorbet period. You really can't go wrong with this, it's the besttttt\n\nAnd that's that! At $42 a person and then additional tax and tip, it was a TON of food and RW was a great way to taste so much of their menu without breaking the bank, since this place is normally pretty high end. The food is really outstanding though and I know I would definitely be back and recommend this to friends. We were all STUFFED and I'm so happy I took advantage of this deal.

We knew the restaurant was going to be a huge success because the food was so amazing. We loved it. We probably went at least 30 times and when Dosa Fillmore opened we frequented that one because it was closer to where we live. We didn't think Fillmore was quite as good as Valencia but it was still excellent.\nFor some unknown reason we stopped going some years ago. No one reason in particular, I think we just got excited about other cuisines and places and lost interest.\nWe went back to the original Valencia location last night with a couple friends. I knew exactly what I wanted to order and was pleased most if not everything I used to love is still on the menu. A few highlights:\n\n- Lamb sliders. These things were awesome. Heat level is INSANE. I applaud the chef for having the nerve to put as much heat into those things as they do. I nearly choked at first as I inhaled a tiny chunk of the lamb and the heat seared the back of my throat. All good. That's the kind of burn anyone who likes spicy food should love. The quality of the lamb which was finely ground was also superb. \n- Chennai chicken. This is always good, however it used to be better. The chicken used to just explode on the palate with various spices and heat, and the accompanying yogurt sauce cooled it perfectly. Now it is more like a standard fare chicken and the sauce is kind of boring. Disappointed but still pretty good.\n- Dahi Vada. This one was the major letdown of the evening. This dish used to be spectacular. It was served in a nice size bowl with a spiderweb thread of yogurt and sauce that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven. Now it is served in one of these gourmet bowls that really allow them to give you half as much and gone is the intricate artwork on top. It still tastes similar but nowhere close to how awesome it used to be. I really think Anjan should restore this dish to its former glory. It was one of the best dishes I've ever encountered anywhere.\n- Corn Poriyal. Very good, refreshing corn spiced perfectly which was a nice break from the heavy flavors everywhere else.\n- White Truffle Dosa. Spot on. As I'd expect from all of the dosas, this one was just as I remembered it and 100% delicious and awesome. \n- Caramelized onion Uttapam. Very good but I didn't think it was very unique. Just ok.\n- Channa Batura. Pretty close to how I remember it and it was usually one of the dishes we loved the most. It still comes out with a gargantuan wheat bread ready to explode with steam in the middle and the divine chickpeas. It is still awesome. I think it used to be a smidgen better but it is still wonderful. \n- We ordered a few rice dishes and a veggie curry also which I thought were good but not the highlight of the meal so I won't go into great detail. \n\nI hope this provides a good review for your consideration of Dosa.

If you've never had it, stop what you're doing right now. \n\nSeriously. Stop it. \n\nGo find Dosa and make damn sure it's good. Better yet, put Dosa on your GPS and get here now. \n\nThis place does not disappoint, not in the least bit. There's a little bit of everything here for everyone, lamb lovers, chicken lovers, vegetarians, Indian cheese lovers (yes this is a thing). \n\nTonight, we ended up tasting from the Dine about Town Menu which gave us an opportunity to try a couple things we normally wouldn't have. \n\nWe started off with the Cochin calamari and Chennai Chicken. The chicken was coated and fried with a great cumin flavor. The calamari was definitely my favorite of the two though. The hints of coconut milk come out and give it a great balance and the calamari was perfectly tender. \n\nSecond course was the Spicy mung masala dosa and Paneer and peas dosa. The Spicy mung dosa had a decent amount of heat to it and I found it a little bit harder to eat. I'm typically not a huge fan of mung (just the word sounds gross...mung...mung...bleh) but this dish was definitely tolerable and probably good if you actually like mung (bleh). Now Paneer I have a special place in my Indian stomach for. \n\nI will eat paneer like it is my f***ing job. \n\nThis particular dosa was incredibly flavorful, which can sometimes be hard because paneer often just takes over the flavor of whatever it's in, kind of like an indian tofu mozzarella cube. \n\nMy only gripe is that my friend I was eating with is an asshole. Now if you have read any of my yelp reviews, you'll know that spice is not always my friend. Well spice reared it's ugly head again and beat me mercilessly into submission. \n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nDo not, I repeat, do not order the Mango habanero sauce unless you are prepared to be clutching a pillow for the next two hours, deduced to nothing but a puddle of heat sweats and shear pain. This is not white person \"OMG, LIKE JALAPENOS ARE SO HOT\" hot. No, it's \"I rub ghost chilis in my eyes for fun\" hot. It's flavorful, you think it's okay, then you start getting adventurous and put more and more on there. Then you realize that the enamel on your teeth have begun to wear down from the fumes. You've been warned. \n\nWe finished off with the pepper chicken and pepper lamb with rice and yogurt. These were alright and honestly probably the weakest part of the night. Both were a little bit too salty for my taste, but they both had a great flavor profile (whatever the means). \n\nI will now digress. \n\nIf you have read all you need to know to convince you to go to Dosa, please stop reading. But for the love of all that is great in this world (see puppies, ice cream, and Nicholas Cage), they have Pappy Van Winkle here. \n\nThere are few bars, restaurants, homes, etc. in San Francisco that have Pappy Van Winkle. For those that are unaware to the world of bourbon, Pappy (in this case a 15 year) is the pinnacle of good bourbon. It's about $18 for a pour, which is actually really cheap for this particular blend, and you will be so much happier after having it. Also, who wouldn't want to have bourbon from a bottle which has an awesome old dude smoking a cigar? \n\nAnyways, look this is a great place and you should go check it out for yourself.

Been here a couple times, and I've liked every single thing I've tried so far. Plus the papadums (lentil chips) they give you to start with are DELICIOUS ... I inhale them all in 30 seconds and have to ask for another bowl.\n\nPani Puri - These gems are AMAZEBALLS. 7 little pani puris for $8 - I would say this was the best appetizer. It was on a special mini appetizer menu so I don't know if they always have them, so get them while you can! Pani puris are little hollow crispy flour balls, and you poke a hole on top. Then they give you 3 items to fill it with (chickpeas, mashed potato, and mung beans) and then they give you 2 sauces (a slightly spicy mint chutney (sauce) and slightly sweet tamarind chutney) to pour on top. The guy who served them to us was so nice, and asked us if we knew how to eat them (we didn't), and expertly showed us how to make one/made one for us! The mint chutney was seriously YUM and I literally ate it by itself and poured it on everything else I ate the rest of dinner.\n\nCrispy Fish Pakora - These are SO good! Little fried fish sticks. But now that I've had them a couple times, I'm starting to think they're not worth the $$$ (5 sticks for $11). Good to try if you've never had them before, though, and they didn't have them at the Fillmore location when I went.\n\nChennai Chicken ($9.5) - This was also very small but very delicious and flavorful, and comes with yogurt for dipping. ($9.50)\n\nLamb Pepper Fry ($19.5) - Good tender lamb but a little salty (and now that I'm looking at the menu prices, expensive too holy cow!). Very small for the price - think one cup of curry. We got it with the lemon rice ($3) but everyone said was good but personally, I'm not a big sour fan, so I'd probably go for coconut next time.\n\nChanna Bhatura ($15) - \"BIG PUFFY THING\" - GET THIS! Fight with your friends over who gets to be the first to rip a hole and deflate the steaming bhatura. Slightly sweet, slightly crispy, and slightly chewy. You will have leftover chickpea masala so you can eat it with the rice or dosa or something later on.\n\nSpicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck. Really good! Basically a giant crepe folded over with mashed potatoes in the middle. It also comes with a lentil soup, which you can also eat with rice too wooot!\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa ($12) - If you come here a lot like me and get bored of the Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, you should get this one! The filling is the normal potato/onion/cashew mix you you'd expect, but with truffle oil. I love truffle oil and you can really taste it here! \n\nFennel and Spinach Dosa ($13) - This one's a little different from the other dosas. Instead of one big crepe, they divide it into a couple of smaller rolled up crepes. And it doesn't have masala, so there are no potatoes, and the filling is sauteed spinach and more vegetable-y. I personally like the other two dosas listed above better.\n\nUttapam: South Indian Moons ($14) - These weren't BAD, but they were nowhere as good as the other dishes. This was a sampler of all five uttapams and they were all pretty unimpressive, and kind of all tasted the same. Kind of like a small thick not-sweet pancake with different things on top.

I would choose this over any of the other dosas (we tried masala chutney, paneer + peas, and the uttapaam, which reminded me of a Korean seafood pancake)\n\nEntree:\n- ORDER: Tamil lamb or chicken curry: both were delicious and extra savory. The lamb was tender and had no hint of gameyness (probably because it was covered in spice!)\n\nDessert:\n- ORDER: Chocolate chai gelato: I'm sure any of their gelatos/sorbets would have been fine. If you MUST order dessert, go with one of these because...\n- AVOID: Gulab jamoon: I've learned from previous encounters that Indian sweets are SWEET. Tooth-achingly-practically-inedible SWEET. So I definitely avoided this particular dessert when it came time to choose. Maybe I wasn't firm enough in my description of the Indian idea of dessert, but all three of my dining companions decided to order this dessert (because they wanted to declare their love of balls?)... and probably bitterly regretted their choice. I don't think anyone finished even one third of one ball. \n\nOVERALL: If Dosa wasn't a 40min drive from me (and if I didn't have to prowl for parking in the Mission) I would probably come by to try a few more of their dosas and their bhatura.

So far, I'm liking it.\n\nProblem #1: _Do not_ order the tasting menu. At $39, it's expensive for what you get. My Lamb Kofta had two meatballs the size of nickels. A complete disappointment for what I was paying. My friends who avoided the tasting menu had reasonable servings at reasonable prices.\n\nProblem #2: _Beware_ of going with a party of 6 or more. We had 7 and received a 20% service charge, rather steep, but when Dosa slaps on another 4% surcharge for S.F. Heath Care, you end up with everything on menu really 33% higher with tax, tip, and surcharge.\n\nPaying $85 for one beer, one glass of wine, one tasting menu, where the main is tiny is absurd.\n\nAside from feeling gouged, I wish Dosa could solve the pricing problem. Some of the food is very good. Some of the Dosas average. It nets out to Decent Indian food in a cool atmosphere for high prices. Pass.\n\nP.S. I too have been emailed by the owner.

"], "author": "Jim W.", "review": "Upon arriving at Dosa on a Thursday at 6 pm, we were seated at the bar until the rest of our party arrived.  The bartender casually introduced some of his favorite dishes to us while we waited.  As folks trickled in, our party became complete and we sat down to a half-full restaurant around 6:30.  By the time we ordered, the restaurant was full and pleasantly noisy with spirited conversations around appetizers and entrees.\n\nDosa specializes in southern Indian food, which is a fairly dramatic departure to what most of us are more familiar with.  That being said, there are some recognizable items on the menu -- things that read \"curry\" or \"lamb\" or \"masala\".  However, the stars of the menu are the namesake of the restaurant: the dosa (and its cousin, the uttapam).  Our server was very enthusiastic in explaining just exactly what these were -- the dosa is a thin rice crepe, while the uttapam is a thicker pancake, both of which can be ordered with a variety of fillings or toppings.\n\nBut first, the appetizers.  We started off with the Chennai Chicken (fried boneless organic chicken marinated in organic yogurt with coriander and cumin).  Boneless buffalo wings from India?  Perhaps, but the mild spices were a surprise, which I appreciated since I could actually taste the chicken, which was tender, moist, and flavorful.  We also had the Dahi Vada, which confused us a bit when it arrived at the table.  The bowl of yogurt we saw actually contained the small lentil dumplings underneath the tamarind and mint design along the top surface.  Not only were the lentil dumplings great, but the leftover yogurt went very well with our entrees also.\n\nI am a huge fan of paneer, so I was immediately drawn to the Peas and Paneer Dosa.  My rice crepe came filled with shredded farmer's cheese, peas ,and cilantro.  While the portion size was relatively small, there was just enough food to satisfy me without making me feel bloated -- as I often do at Indian restaurants!  The peas and paneer were also very subtly spiced, allowing all of the main ingredients to shine for themselves.  The dosa and uttapam dishes come with sambar (a lenti dipping soup) and two chutneys (tomato and coconut).  The tomato chutney was a particularly good accompaniment to my peas and paneer lentil.\n\nWe also ordered an uttapam topped with a masala containing potatoes, onions, and cashews.  The uttapam was a more substantial pancake, which made it more integral to the taste and texture of the dish.  If I were to return to this restaurant, I would definitely order the uttapam over the dosa.  Another masala we tried was the Channa Bhatura, which contained garbonzo beans witha choice of  an oversized puffy wheat bread or a vegan poori (fried bread made from whole grain durum wheat).  We assumed that the non-vegan wheat bread would not be fried, since it wasn't mentioned specifically in the menu, but it came to the table glistening with oil.  A bread was definitely required for the masalas, but perhaps a baked option would have been more appreciated here.  Nonetheless, both of these masalas were great dishes with an obvious taste departure from the more commonly known northern Indian cuisine -- I suppose everything simply tasted milder.\n\nTo round things out, we also ordered a more familiar Tamil vegetable curry with cauliflower, green beans, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes over coconut rice.  This dish was unoffensive and rather plain -- it was, once again, very subtle in spicing, but the vegetables by themselves weren't particularly punchy in flavor, leaving a bit of a vacuum of taste with each bite.  The subtlety of spices in the other dishes were to their advantage, but not so well here.  Then again, this vegetable curry isn't terribly adventurous when it comes to southern Indian cuisine, so I'm not surprised that I wasn't terribly impressed by it.\n\nI suppose the lesson here is to understand the motivation for this restaurant.  Do not treat it like your local lunch buffet Indian restaurant where your tandoori chicken is haphazardly perched over a bed of biryani.  Instead, embrace the individual flavors of the dosas and the uttapams and let the ingredients speak loudly with undertones of Indian spices.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-08-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Now, when we finally did get our food, starting with the Chennai Chicken and the Medu Vada, it was wonderful.

Not fine: They seat 2 other parties who came after us and were THE SAME SIZE as ours. Those guys didn't have reservations either, which we knew since we spent 45 minutes talking to them outside.

Then, when they finally succeeded in serving us the wrong starters, we couldn't get a server to take them away (we would have eaten them, but no doubt we would have been charged for them + our own). Our waitress seemed everywhere but no where near us, and all the other servers we made eye contact with, and motioned to, ignored us. I finally had to physically walk the incorrect plates over to the hostess. That was not acceptable.\n \nNow, when we finally did get our food, starting with the Chennai Chicken and the Medu Vada, it was wonderful. Our entrees, devoured family style, were the Rava Masala, Egg Dosa, and the Spring Dosa: all excellent. Very filling. None of us left the table hungry. However, given the runaround we got with the wrong plates, not to mention the problems being seated in the first place, they could of earned their tip by comping us a starter or two- even an apology would have been appreciated. But we got nothing of the sort, which by then, wasn't surprising.\n \nAs for the space itself, crowded and noisy. I know that the space is limited, and they want to accommodate as many wallets- excuse me, I mean \"patrons\" as possible, but there is no room to gesture while talking without smacking someone at the next table. Consequently the noise is an issue if you normally enjoy talking (as opposed to shouting) to you dinner companions.\n \nTake away this: the food is delicious, the service is amateur.

Every time I go I never have a reservation, only a desperate hope and prayer that a table for two might be opening up sometime in the next hour for me and my dining partner.  Alas, my prayer goes unanswered as I'm turned away time and time again by a line of people outside and a hostess who is unable to accommodate my hunger pangs and desire for that large South Indian crepe craving that can only be cured by a whopping dosa.  Tonight, however, God looked kindly upon me and my friend as we were told a table would be available in 15 minutes.  I was about to get my dosa fix!  I haven't had a dosa since I visited India four years ago, but I distinctly remember how much I enjoyed it.  I've been hearing great things about Dosa and the excellent South Indian cuisine since it opened on Valencia.  Needless to say, after this many attempts and all the hype, I was ready to be disappointed.  I was not.\n\nThe meal started off right with the friendly and courteous owner himself, Anjan taking our order and making some helpful recommendations (I was so hungry and eager that I was about to order food for the next three days and he held me back).  We started off with the Chennai Chicken which was a delicious mix of spicy kick calmed by the cool yogurt dipping sauce.   We then proceeded to share the Masala Dosa which was deliciously paired with the flavorful chutneys and superbly prepared sambar.  We also ordered the Prawn Coconut Curry and the Tamil Lamb Curry which were both extraordinary.  I expected that they would be too spicy, salty or sweet.  They were both perfectly seasoned and the not overpowering at all.  Every bite of the curries mixed with the basmati rice or Uttapam was a pleasure to consume.  The portions were very reasonable and we had plenty of food leftover to take home.  The prices were very very reasonable and the portions very generous for any Indian restaurant, much less one of this caliber.  The service was excellent and the waitstaff very attentive.   \n\nIf you haven't had South Indian food, I highly recommend trying it out.  This ain't your momma's Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan we're talking about here.  It's totally different from the mainstream Indian fare.  Anjan and his wife know how to run a restaurant.  He must have come over to our table 3 or 4 times to talk to us about the food and our experience.   That level of attention always stands out to me because an owner who cares that much about his food and patrons demonstrates how much he loves his restaurant.  We were around when things were slowing down and chatted with him for a bit.  I'm happy that a guy that nice is having this type of success with his first restaurant.

It seemed a little chaotic inside because there were people everywhere.  It was also very loud, but I guess that is to be expected from a trendy place like this one.  Unfortunately, the place was so crowded it was almost uncomfortable.  There were a lot of people waiting outside because the restaurant is so small that there is no waiting area inside.  Pretty much every inch of space is occupied by a table.  During dinner, we shared a table with another group.  You're literally eating with other people, but it's so loud, they can't really hear what you're saying anyway even though they are sitting right next to you.  \n\nOn the upside, I really liked the decor of the place.  If you're looking for a trendy hot spot that serves good food, this is the place to go.  Just go after 9:00 PM so you won't be waiting an hour for a table.  The staff was also very friendly.  The owner apologized for the long wait and looked like he was very involved in helping the staff get things moving.

Typically, outside of the South Bay, North Indian restaurants outnumber South Indian ones by at least 10:1.  And usually the South Indian restaurants that exist are cheap (read: poor ambience/bad service/generally ghetto), vegetarian and only cater to Indians.  As such, Dosa is a breath of fresh air and really destroys all of the stereotypes generally attributed to South Indian restaurants --- plus it's in SF.  I've been 4 times and have really enjoyed my experiences each and every time.  For apps, I'm a big fan of the dahi vada.  The vada is crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside and probably as well-presented as I've ever seen the dish, even in India.  The accompanying yogurt and chutneys match well with the vada.  I don't really care for the Chennai chicken --- it's a little too greasy and flavorless.  The sada paper dosa is my favorite dosa.  Even my mom, who is universally considered the best dosa cook in my hometown, really likes them.  The sada paper is buttery and crispy and perfect for dipping in sambar and chutney.

However, I did adore the channa (best I've had) and chutneys that came with them (best mixed together!), but hated the sambar (too thick and sour for me).

Good to try if you've never had them before, though, and they didn't have them at the Fillmore location when I went.\n\nChennai Chicken ($9.5) - This was also very small but very delicious and flavorful, and comes with yogurt for dipping. ($9.50)\n\nLamb Pepper Fry ($19.5) - Good tender lamb but a little salty (and now that I'm looking at the menu prices, expensive too holy cow!). Very small for the price - think one cup of curry. We got it with the lemon rice ($3) but everyone said was good but personally, I'm not a big sour fan, so I'd probably go for coconut next time.\n\nChanna Bhatura ($15) - \"BIG PUFFY THING\" - GET THIS! Fight with your friends over who gets to be the first to rip a hole and deflate the steaming bhatura. Slightly sweet, slightly crispy, and slightly chewy. You will have leftover chickpea masala so you can eat it with the rice or dosa or something later on.\n\nSpicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck. Really good! Basically a giant crepe folded over with mashed potatoes in the middle. It also comes with a lentil soup, which you can also eat with rice too wooot!\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa ($12) - If you come here a lot like me and get bored of the Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, you should get this one! The filling is the normal potato/onion/cashew mix you you'd expect, but with truffle oil. I love truffle oil and you can really taste it here! \n\nFennel and Spinach Dosa ($13) - This one's a little different from the other dosas. Instead of one big crepe, they divide it into a couple of smaller rolled up crepes. And it doesn't have masala, so there are no potatoes, and the filling is sauteed spinach and more vegetable-y. I personally like the other two dosas listed above better.\n\nUttapam: South Indian Moons ($14) - These weren't BAD, but they were nowhere as good as the other dishes. This was a sampler of all five uttapams and they were all pretty unimpressive, and kind of all tasted the same. Kind of like a small thick not-sweet pancake with different things on top. I would just not order an Uttapam and get another Dosa instead lol.\n\nDrooling after writing this review... can't wait to go back!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-05-29"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered the Lamb Pepper Fry and after one bite, I almost grabbed my fork and fought off the rest of the guests just so I could have it all to myself.

We asked him for a suggestion about the street food portion which I am so thankful we did because his recommendation was amazing. The menu changes frequently so asking for a suggestion is probably the better option as opposed to searching through yelp photos since they might not have something you're looking at.

You are basically given hollow fried bread balls and you delicately poke a hole through it, as to not crack the entire thing. You then fill it a little with the mixture of chickpeas, mung, and squash. Next comes the sauces which you adjust amounts depending on your taste, the tamarind being sweet, and the cilantro mint chile having a kick! Fill that baby up with sauces and then quickly put the entire thing in your mouth before the sauces make it soggy. It was definitely a delicious experience. \n\nCOCONUT CHICKEN MASALA: This came with an extremely lemony rice that complimented the coconut chicken masala very well and brought the flavors out deliciously.

Better yet, put Dosa on your GPS and get here now. \n\nThis place does not disappoint, not in the least bit. There's a little bit of everything here for everyone, lamb lovers, chicken lovers, vegetarians, Indian cheese lovers (yes this is a thing). \n\nTonight, we ended up tasting from the Dine about Town Menu which gave us an opportunity to try a couple things we normally wouldn't have. \n\nWe started off with the Cochin calamari and Chennai Chicken. The chicken was coated and fried with a great cumin flavor. The calamari was definitely my favorite of the two though. The hints of coconut milk come out and give it a great balance and the calamari was perfectly tender. \n\nSecond course was the Spicy mung masala dosa and Paneer and peas dosa. The Spicy mung dosa had a decent amount of heat to it and I found it a little bit harder to eat. I'm typically not a huge fan of mung (just the word sounds gross...mung...mung...bleh) but this dish was definitely tolerable and probably good if you actually like mung (bleh). Now Paneer I have a special place in my Indian stomach for. \n\nI will eat paneer like it is my f***ing job. \n\nThis particular dosa was incredibly flavorful, which can sometimes be hard because paneer often just takes over the flavor of whatever it's in, kind of like an indian tofu mozzarella cube. \n\nMy only gripe is that my friend I was eating with is an asshole. Now if you have read any of my yelp reviews, you'll know that spice is not always my friend. Well spice reared it's ugly head again and beat me mercilessly into submission. \n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nDo not, I repeat, do not order the Mango habanero sauce unless you are prepared to be clutching a pillow for the next two hours, deduced to nothing but a puddle of heat sweats and shear pain. This is not white person \"OMG, LIKE JALAPENOS ARE SO HOT\" hot. No, it's \"I rub ghost chilis in my eyes for fun\" hot. It's flavorful, you think it's okay, then you start getting adventurous and put more and more on there. Then you realize that the enamel on your teeth have begun to wear down from the fumes. You've been warned. \n\nWe finished off with the pepper chicken and pepper lamb with rice and yogurt. These were alright and honestly probably the weakest part of the night. Both were a little bit too salty for my taste, but they both had a great flavor profile (whatever the means). \n\nI will now digress. \n\nIf you have read all you need to know to convince you to go to Dosa, please stop reading. But for the love of all that is great in this world (see puppies, ice cream, and Nicholas Cage), they have Pappy Van Winkle here. \n\nThere are few bars, restaurants, homes, etc. in San Francisco that have Pappy Van Winkle. For those that are unaware to the world of bourbon, Pappy (in this case a 15 year) is the pinnacle of good bourbon. It's about $18 for a pour, which is actually really cheap for this particular blend, and you will be so much happier after having it. Also, who wouldn't want to have bourbon from a bottle which has an awesome old dude smoking a cigar? \n\nAnyways, look this is a great place and you should go check it out for yourself. The staff is pretty friendly, and the wait isn't too bad, provided you're willing to sit at the bar. Otherwise, make a reservation and please go stuff your face with some of the best Indian food in SF.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-06-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Spicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck.

"], "author": "Cynthia W.", "review": "Differences between Valencia location and Fillmore location: The Valencia location is a lot smaller and has the Crispy Fish Pakora, while the Fillmore location feels a lot more hip/trendy.\n\nHoly moly I love this place. Been here a couple times, and I've liked every single thing I've tried so far. Plus the papadums (lentil chips) they give you to start with are DELICIOUS ... I inhale them all in 30 seconds and have to ask for another bowl.\n\nPani Puri - These gems are AMAZEBALLS. 7 little pani puris for $8 - I would say this was the best appetizer. It was on a special mini appetizer menu so I don't know if they always have them, so get them while you can! Pani puris are little hollow crispy flour balls, and you poke a hole on top. Then they give you 3 items to fill it with (chickpeas, mashed potato, and mung beans) and then they give you 2 sauces (a slightly spicy mint chutney (sauce) and slightly sweet tamarind chutney) to pour on top. The guy who served them to us was so nice, and asked us if we knew how to eat them (we didn't), and expertly showed us how to make one/made one for us! The mint chutney was seriously YUM and I literally ate it by itself and poured it on everything else I ate the rest of dinner.\n\nCrispy Fish Pakora - These are SO good! Little fried fish sticks. But now that I've had them a couple times, I'm starting to think they're not worth the $$$ (5 sticks for $11). Good to try if you've never had them before, though, and they didn't have them at the Fillmore location when I went.\n\nChennai Chicken ($9.5) - This was also very small but very delicious and flavorful, and comes with yogurt for dipping. ($9.50)\n\nLamb Pepper Fry ($19.5) - Good tender lamb but a little salty (and now that I'm looking at the menu prices, expensive too holy cow!). Very small for the price - think one cup of curry. We got it with the lemon rice ($3) but everyone said was good but personally, I'm not a big sour fan, so I'd probably go for coconut next time.\n\nChanna Bhatura ($15) - \"BIG PUFFY THING\" - GET THIS! Fight with your friends over who gets to be the first to rip a hole and deflate the steaming bhatura. Slightly sweet, slightly crispy, and slightly chewy. You will have leftover chickpea masala so you can eat it with the rice or dosa or something later on.\n\nSpicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck. Really good! Basically a giant crepe folded over with mashed potatoes in the middle. It also comes with a lentil soup, which you can also eat with rice too wooot!\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa ($12) - If you come here a lot like me and get bored of the Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, you should get this one! The filling is the normal potato/onion/cashew mix you you'd expect, but with truffle oil. I love truffle oil and you can really taste it here! \n\nFennel and Spinach Dosa ($13) - This one's a little different from the other dosas. Instead of one big crepe, they divide it into a couple of smaller rolled up crepes. And it doesn't have masala, so there are no potatoes, and the filling is sauteed spinach and more vegetable-y. I personally like the other two dosas listed above better.\n\nUttapam: South Indian Moons ($14) - These weren't BAD, but they were nowhere as good as the other dishes. This was a sampler of all five uttapams and they were all pretty unimpressive, and kind of all tasted the same. Kind of like a small thick not-sweet pancake with different things on top. I would just not order an Uttapam and get another Dosa instead lol.\n\nDrooling after writing this review... can't wait to go back!", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-05-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Vada Sambar, Masala dosa..

We decided to go and check it out at 7p anyway and actually had no wait to sit at the bar. (Fortune cookie advice: If you're desperate to eat and can't wait for your reservation, try your luck. You may get lucky.)\n\nWe had the fish pakora as an appetizer, 5 stars. Perfect crunchiness with great fish texture and sweetness.

We took the BART from Fremont and got delayed by half an hour. We called ahead and explained to them that we were getting late. They were very courteous and said it wouldn't be a problem as long as we were done by 830 pm (we reached at 730 pm).  All that didn't matter as they had our table ready and we had pretty much decided what we wanted on the way to the place. \n\nOnce seated, service was quick and our waitress was really nice and friendly. We ordered our food and less than three minutes later, we had our Dahi Vada. Being Indians in a very pricey restaurant, I guess our expectations were equally high. The $9 Vada was not even worth half as much. The presentation was nice, but that was it. The Vada was old, had too much cumin, and was a huge letdown, especially since we'd heard it was a favorite. Just based on that, I immediately gave it 1-1.5 stars. Next, I ordered Rasam for my itchy throat and literally the only thing good about that was that it was hot and seasoned with spices reasonably well. It tasted pretty sad though. My rating was now a solid 2. My girlfriend still hovering at 1-1.5. At this point, we were actually talking about opening our own restaurant and how much better we'd be at making Indian food. \n\nThen came our main course dishes and lifted our ratings to 3 stars. We ordered a Channa Batura and a Masala Dosa. The Batura was the largest I've ever had, and that includes restaurants in India. It was a standard affair, except of course, it's sheer size. The Channa was, well.. We make it better at home! The Masala Dosa was bland as a wall, but the tomato chutney and sambar were very nice. In all fairness, we didn't ask for it to be spicy, because, well, we didn't know what to and what not to expect. The Dosa itself was well cooked and tasty, if of course, you didn't care about the flavor too much. All that these dishes did was add $25 to our bill of $13 and boost our rating of this place from 2 to 3 stars. \n\nWe would never go there again, if we could help it.

Dosa, I have a concussion because I have been whipping my hair back and forth since I ate here (and dry eye syndrome for weeping that you are so far away from me).\n\nTo begin with, Dosa is so on top of it, I ate here during a SF heat wave. You heard me. Evidently, things like 'air conditioning' are unheard of in (some? many?) SF restaurants. So, I was fortunate enough to be walking the streets like a hooker during these hot times in the city. What to eat on a hot day? Indian! So, the fact that I loved the experience despite sweating like a wh0re in church really says something about the quality (and company).\n\nI discovered Dosa thanks to one of my oldest friends with whom I'd recently re-connected (later in the evening, one of my best buddies and his gal pal joined us). Psyched to be catching up, I ignored the menu for a while to just sit and talk. But, talking can only take me so far. I needed food. And, we got it. Before I chat up the food, though, I need to give much thanks to our server. She was helpful and present without being hovering or obtrusive. Nicely done. Check this spread:\n\nCalamari sauteed in coconut milk and served with greens -- succulent. Each bite burst with flavor. To do the dish justice, couple the meat with the milk with the greens. Perfection. It got the point that even though we hadn't seen each other in years, my friend and I sat in silenced and grubbed on the octopus;\n\nPrawns with coconut rice, chile, coriander, and more good stuff -- ridiculous. These prawns had been living the good life; they were huge. Their natural sweetness when added to the spice of the chile and coriander created a party in my mouth. The coconut rice dulled the heat enough to leave amazing flavor on the plate and in my belly; and\n\nCilantro Mint Masala Dosa. So, this is what dosa is supposed to taste like. I'd had a dosa experience in Chicago that... wasn't like this. I loved it. I loved every bite. The crepe was flaky, the sambar was interesting without being overpowering, the chutneys were a taste and texture success, and the mint/cilantro went brilliantly with the potatoes and onions.\n\nI washed down all this yummy food with a couple of glasses of Chilean rose and I couldn't have been happier.

I thought it was the perfect choice because of its convenient mission locale (good for people coming from all areas of the city) and it was good for my vegetarian family (so many options!), also because some of my family is always riding me about trying more spicy foods (they are basque after all) and I figured Indian food has a lot of nice spices. Little did I know these members of my family were really anti on the Indian food, so the dinner ended up being a total mess. Mostly because it's impossible for them to keep opinions to themselves and let everyone else enjoy. Sigh, but you know fam...you still love 'em.\n\nI was a bit annoyed starting off because we had a reservation, that I made months in advance, and we still waited quite a bit for our table. Also, the staff wasn't the friendlist, but neither were my guests so I would give them another shot (as I did with my guests!) \n\nDosa doesn't have just spicy curries. Which works out good for me because my gastroenterologist would not be pleased seeing my family history and all. I asked them what I could have that wouldn't be spicy and they selected a few items for me. Namely, the Dosas are what you should be ordering (hence the name). The fam on the other hand, ordered some of the spiciest dishes available and were visibly...and verbally... unhappy.  They ended up drinking too much and getting sick. I ended up getting sick from the all tension and the staff wasn't too good about rectifying the situation, they mostly threw up their hands, which was annoying because their recommendations for me were so on par. \n\nThe Dosa I had was really yummy, but it was so hard to enjoy.

I've been wanting to come here for ages and was stoked when this venue was suggested for brunch/lunch. Although it's in the Mission area, it's more in the \"charming neighbourhood, restaurant row\" area than the traditionally grimy/grungy image associated with Mission.\n\nBetween the three of us, we tasted idlis, vada, plain utthappam, the spiced mung salad and the habanero/mango masala dosa. The first three were as expected, and props for the texture of the utthappam, which was just the right balance between soft and crispy. The mung salad was unbelievably delicious and has me tempted to try to recreate it at home. Only beef is that the portion size is a little small for the $9 price tag.\n\nNow, a word to the wise for those foolish enough to brave the habanero dosa. Even though I was given a taste of the chutney and knew what kind of heat was in store, I naively thought that my tongue would be able to withstand the assault of the habanero-mango sauce with the hot masala and the hot sambar. Alas, I could not finish the delicious dosa without two glasses of water and three cups of yogurt. Seriously, if you think you have a high spice tolerance, beware. I'm glad I tried it but am more than happy to experiment with something a little less fiery the next time. The sambar and chutneys were tasty, with just the right amount of tang and spice.\n\nFor dessert, we split the rasmalai, which was surprisingly not cloyingly sweet. I was tempted to try the Tea-ramisu (with a chocolate-chai sauce, chai-infused rum and paneer), but will save it for next time.\n\nThe service was the only letdown - they forgot the dahi vada we ordered and took much longer than expected to bring the food out, given that the restaurant was not packed. Luckily, I was in the mood for a leisurely lunch, but this would have bugged me a lot more under normal circumstances.\n\nMake sure to stop by if you're in the area.

The curry was perfect, lamb was sweet and juicy tendery swimming in a well seasoned Indian curry. The channa bhatura was what we dipped in the curry with, but I didn't really enjoy this bread, naan looking thing.

Being avid Indian food fanatics, we agreed on Dosa and we were both blown away.  \n\nDosa is not like any other Indian food we've had before.  Almost every Indian restaurant we've had up until now has focused primarily on Tandoori BBQ, Curry, Basmati, Naan, etc. You won't find any of those at Dosa...  They specialize in South Indian cuisine, which centers on Dosa flat breads and Uttapans.  \n\nWe started with the Dahi Vada appetizer which was superb.  It was this beautifully presented dish of Lentil dumplings infused with organic yogurt, tamarind, mint, and other spices.  It tasted wonderful; very flavorful and a moderate sized portion for two people.\n\nNext was our Spinach and Paneer Jumbo Prawn curry with coconut rice - the one dish that reminded me of other Indian restaurants I've had before.  Essentially it was an Aloo Palak dish with shrimp.  It was OK, better than fast food Indian places such as Naan & Curry.  However, it wasn't as fresh and tasty as Sultan's spinach Curry.  Out of everything we ordered, I was least impressed with this dish.\n\nOur last dish was a classic Masala Dosa.  We've never had Dosa's before so we didn't know which one to order.  Thus our decision to start with the Classic (apparently the tried and truest).  I was amazed at how large this was.

One is a creamy one that tastes pretty garlicky; another is one that reminds me of a vegetable soup.  The third one, my favorite, was a fresh tomato based puree that was cold and reminded me of a blended Salsa.\n\nOur dinner was fantastic and was a pleasant introduction to South Indian Cuisine.  We will definitely be back again and again to try the other Dosa's and Uttapans that all sounded amazing.

Otherwise you may be setting yourself up for disappointment both in terms of the quality and the price. My girlfriend and I went this past Sunday evening and got the tasting menu and a \"chef's selection\" of uttapams. From the tasting menu, we chose a seafood vada (fritter), a \"seasonal\" fennel and spinach dosa, and a chicken korma dish. The price of the tasting menu was $40 so I figured that the dishes would each be full sized. However, each dish was disappointingly tiny. The vada was a single, round fritter, about the diameter of a water glass--maybe four small bites at the most. However, neither of us minded the size since it was insanely spicy, almost to the point of being inedible. Mind you, we're not shy when it comes to spice--I'll put Tabasco, Tapatio, Cholula, whatever all over any dish, but this was like blazing, eyes tearing up, nose running, breaking out in a cold sweat, sick to your stomach spicy. Furthermore, there was no indication on the menu of how hot this dish would be. It was accompanied by a similarly impossibly spicy dhal, of which we each could only eat a bite or two due to the severe burning in our mouths and the sweat breaking out on our brows. We told our waitress we like spice, but that this was just over the top, and so if she could ask the chef to just tone it down a notch on the subsequent dishes, that would be great. She said she'd let the kitchen know.

You could get a tastier chicken korma from any typical, down-the-street type Indian restaurant. Finally came the five uttapams, which each had a different topping chosen by the chef. They were...fine. They didn't have a lot of flavor and were mostly saved by the coconut chutney that they came with. In the end, the bill came to over $70 (including the tip) for just the two of us, and we didn't even order any drinks or dessert. For that price, we could have gotten a feast from almost any other Indian restaurant that would have given us leftovers for days and would have tasted a lot better, or we could have gone to any of the other nearby, moderately high end restaurants in the neighborhood, and eaten much better. Overall, an incredibly disappointing dining experience from start to finish. The only reason I didn't give them one star is because the service was reasonably good, and it has a nice ambiance (though on the particular night we went, the adult son of the family seated next to us was actually playing a video game on his phone at full volume during a significant portion of the meal--way to classy it up, buddy). I'll be giving Dosa a miss in the future, and will instead be going to their nearby, more reasonably priced competitor when I'm in the neighborhood and have a hankering for Indian food. If I must return to Dosa (at gunpoint, for example), I'll be pretty much sticking to the dosas.

For example: masala. So like a potato onion curry ish thing. \n- UTTAPAM is also a crepe as well, which is slightly thicker and the ingredients are rolled into it, so it comes out like a small burrito. \n- Both DOSAS and UTTAPAM are served with three things...\n1) Lentil soup \n2) Tomato Chutney and \n3) Coconut Garlickey Chutney\n\nOur server was really helpful and helped us order about 2 dosas, an egg plate and 3 uttapams -- once of which was a sweet one. He then suggested for us to try other chutneys, and subsequently after agreeing to it, he brought out 6 different chutneys for us to try: a lime one, a lemon one, a mango one, a dried tomato one, a spicy habernero one, and something else I cannot remember. I definitely suggest trying the tomato one because it has a bit of spice to it but also a salty kick. Put a dab of this on one of your dosas or uttapams and then load it on with the tomato chutney they give you from the beginning and you're golden. Trust!! \n\nFor newbie diners at Dosa, I highly recommend getting...\n1) Masala Dosa\n2) Paneer & Peas Uttapam\n3) A side of their tomato chutney for 50 cents.\n\nI will be back to dine at Dosa to try their curry that they ran out of when we arrived.

There was a wait for a table, but we decided to take a seat at the bar instead.  Really it's an ideal situation for me.  Might as well just the distance between myself and the alcohol down to a minimum, right?  Since it was my first time here, the bartender offered a few friendly suggestions on what and how to order.  Having already had somewhat of an idea of where we were going, we went with the onion pakora, lamb kofka with lemon rice and chutney masala dosa.

They are so light and crispy and cheesy!  Fantastic!\n\nThe onion pakora arrived quickly and it was a perfect way to start.  Basically an Indian version of the blooming onion, the perfume of cumin and coriander invaded our senses and whet our appetites.  There was just enough batter to make it crunchy, but not so much so that you forgot what you were eating, it was fantastic.  Granted, it's pretty tough to go wrong with something battered and fried in my book.  \n\nThe entrees of the lamb kafka and dosa arrived not much later as our corner of the bar was covered with a massive triangle of dosa and a healthy portion of lamb and rice.  The dosa was light and crispy on the outside, which just a bit of chewiness as you bit into it.  The lamb kafka was terrific as well with six good sized lamb meatballs swimming in a spicy, rich and flavorful sauce.

Friday night I was finally able to team up with my partner in crime Jen O. for an early dinner and we both agreed on Dosa.\n\nWe decided we would try the 4 course tasting menu, because the portions are a bit smaller and since there was two of us we ordered two things from each course and shared. Plus, at $30 per person, this is pretty reasonable. \n\nWe also did the wine pairing and shared, so for $16 each we got to sample six wines. I don't recommend the wine pairing though, because though the wines are actually quite good and so is the food, The wine does not enhance the flavor of the food because the spice wipes out the wine. Honestly, Jen and I both agreed that a nice cold glass of beer would have been better with our meals. \n\nSo here is what we had. My favorites are marked by an *.\n\n1.

Mini Dosa\n\nPaneer Dosa - Dosa filled with spiced, grilled farmer's cheese, peas and cilantro. (Excellent)\n\n* Chatni Masala Dosa - Our signature South Indian savory crepe filled with creamy, spiced Indian potatoes, onions, cashew nuts with a spiced chutney spread of blended baby eggplant (Excellent x2)\n\n3. South Indian Curry\n\n** South Indian Lamb Kofta - Spiced natural & free-range lamb meatballs in a creamy sauce of tomatoes & spinach served with lemon basmati rice and raita (Yes, it is as good as it sounds).\n\n* Kerala Chicken & Cauliflower - Tender free-range chicken in a grated coconut sauce with green beans and tomatoes, with basmati rice and raita made with Strauss organic yogurt (Delicious)\n\n4. Dessert \n\n* Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream) -Pistachio\n\nGulab Jamoon -Two soft, lightly-fried milk and dough balls served in a warm, cardamom flavored sugar syrup (Almost identical in taste and texture as pancakes soaked in syrup, except no maple taste. Too sweet for me).\n\nAmbiance - We were seated in a roomy corner next to an open window on a warm night in the Mission district - Bitchin'\n\nService - It was great.

Unfortunately, the Chutney Masala Dosa had a filling too thin and slippery to top my list. \n\nI was considering giving the place 4 stars because it's a little pricey, but I think the food and the atmosphere speak for themselves. My Indian friend with whom we had dinner recognized the owner from a family wedding. This made me eye him curiously throughout the night and I have to say that I liked the way he seemed to stay calm, aware and active- not that I know anything about restaurant management. \n\nDosa is for rare occasions, since the price tops similar formidable taste establishments: Udupi for Indian food or Osha for Thai.

Although I'm not behind this 'no reservations' policy (look, man, I can plan where I'm going to be and what time, even if other people can't) I do think the staff do everything possible to make the process as painless as possible.  The bartender looked like he was scanning for snipers, he was so on top of everyone's drink needs.  People would just turn towards the bar, and he'd have a drinks menu in their hand!  If you got low on a glass, he'd ask you if you wanted more.  None of that 'excuse me, bartender' nonsense you get from 'hip' places.  (NB. When did it become 'hip' to be rude?)\n\nSo having finally gotten our seats, (and yes, we're so close to everyone, I can hear the guy at the next table explaining to his date why he and his Dad don't see each other much, even though his Dad lives 10 miles away), we made the critical mistake of not ordering our food when the waitress took our drinks order.  Apparently, this is a major faux pas at Dosa, for which we were punished by her taking the order of four other tables, ignoring our efforts to gain eye contact, to reel her back in.  She never forgave us for that indiscretion either, I would note.\n\nSo we do order. The drinks arrived.  The drinks are spilled.  This happens.  The server was very nice about it, offered to pay for cleaning (red wine, light colored shirt) but hey, that does happen, the shirt is a few years old, don't worry about it, and we were comped for our drinks.  Nothing beyond what I would have expected, but nothing less either.\n\nWithin minutes (less than 5, mind you) of ordering, the lentil doughnut as my husband calls it (Vada Sambar to the rest of us) arrives at the table.  Yummy, hearty, better suited for a colder day (my mistake, not theirs) but delicious.  We also ordered the Masala Dosa, which was very tasty, and the South Indian Moons.  This one is a little sample plate of each of the different types of Uttapam (the chile and corriander was the best) and this dish was the bomb.  Fantastic channa dal to go with it, spicy, but tasty.  Ummm, so yummy.\n\nSo overall, four stars.  Really terrific service (even with the red wine spilage), fantastic food, well chosen beverage list to accompany the food.

I opted to try something new and ordered an Uttapam, a slightly thicker version of a dosa, mixed with green chilies, onions and fresh cilantro.

I thought maybe I should visit again, but then I realized that I have way too many restaurants left on my list to hit up before I leave SF...and that I am, in fact, narcissistic enough to think that my review might serve some use in this Yelp world. So here you go:\n\n\"Congratulations, Dosa! You have just made it into the Overrated Club!\" I wanted so much to like Dosa - hip Mission locale, cool decor, vibrant energy, courteous and down-to-earth service (both while waiting for our table for four and during the meal). However, there was a lot of the experience that just seemed a little bit \"off.\" Our server was very enthusiastic about telling us his favorites within each section of the *overwhelmingly* large menu. Since he seemed so friendly and we were so indecisive, my friend and I got into our \"assault the waiter with questions\" mode. He handled it well, but when we asked what the difference between fresh corriander and cilantro was, he seemed flustered and was unable to find an answer for us. I think that we scared him because after that we never saw him again. The service thereafter was moderately good, though it took some effort to flag down more water.\n\nOh well, it's probably best because some of his suggestions were real disappointments, and I am a terrible liar. Our starter, the Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings topped with yogurt, tamarind, and mint) sounded intriguing and unique to Dosa. Unfortunately, the presentation and the texture of the dish elicited a unanimous verdict, \"It's like 7 layer bean dip.\" Not appetizing unless it is Super Bowl Sunday. For our entrees, I had the Chatni Masala dosa, which we all agreed was the best pick of the table; it would have been nice though if the waiter had confirmed whether it would be made with the eggplant or the ridge gourd.

It's a classic case of sacrificing quality for quantity - the half-dollar sized uttapams were all dry and none of their toppings was able to stand out (I enjoyed the paneer & peas most, probably because I am a cheesehound like that).\n\nDespite how terribly loud it was, we were able to carry on a lively discussion about NYC vs. Bay Area lifestyle and dining (p.s. I'm always up for this conversation...). While the food was not offensive, the overall experience was unimpressive, especially given the attention and high praise Dosa has received.\n\n3.5 stars for ambiance + 3.5 stars for service + 3 stars for food  = an induction into the Bay Area Chapter of the Overrated Club.", "rating": 3, "date": "2007-06-22"}, {"excerpts": ["They don't even give you enough palya (the potatoes in the center) if you get a masala dosa, and they skimp on chutney in general.

Contrary to what some reviews have stated, the dosas look and taste pretty like the ones actually found in South India (not that cross-cultural culinary experimentation would be a problem anyway).

Every time I go I never have a reservation, only a desperate hope and prayer that a table for two might be opening up sometime in the next hour for me and my dining partner.  Alas, my prayer goes unanswered as I'm turned away time and time again by a line of people outside and a hostess who is unable to accommodate my hunger pangs and desire for that large South Indian crepe craving that can only be cured by a whopping dosa.  Tonight, however, God looked kindly upon me and my friend as we were told a table would be available in 15 minutes.  I was about to get my dosa fix!  I haven't had a dosa since I visited India four years ago, but I distinctly remember how much I enjoyed it.  I've been hearing great things about Dosa and the excellent South Indian cuisine since it opened on Valencia.  Needless to say, after this many attempts and all the hype, I was ready to be disappointed.  I was not.\n\nThe meal started off right with the friendly and courteous owner himself, Anjan taking our order and making some helpful recommendations (I was so hungry and eager that I was about to order food for the next three days and he held me back).  We started off with the Chennai Chicken which was a delicious mix of spicy kick calmed by the cool yogurt dipping sauce.   We then proceeded to share the Masala Dosa which was deliciously paired with the flavorful chutneys and superbly prepared sambar.  We also ordered the Prawn Coconut Curry and the Tamil Lamb Curry which were both extraordinary.  I expected that they would be too spicy, salty or sweet.  They were both perfectly seasoned and the not overpowering at all.  Every bite of the curries mixed with the basmati rice or Uttapam was a pleasure to consume.  The portions were very reasonable and we had plenty of food leftover to take home.  The prices were very very reasonable and the portions very generous for any Indian restaurant, much less one of this caliber.  The service was excellent and the waitstaff very attentive.   \n\nIf you haven't had South Indian food, I highly recommend trying it out.  This ain't your momma's Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan we're talking about here.  It's totally different from the mainstream Indian fare.  Anjan and his wife know how to run a restaurant.  He must have come over to our table 3 or 4 times to talk to us about the food and our experience.   That level of attention always stands out to me because an owner who cares that much about his food and patrons demonstrates how much he loves his restaurant.  We were around when things were slowing down and chatted with him for a bit.  I'm happy that a guy that nice is having this type of success with his first restaurant.

Of course, I wanted to try their infamous dosas so I ordered the spicy mung masala dosa, which is filled with curried-flavor mung bean and potato with chopped up onions and bell peppers.  My man ordered the paneer and peas dosa, which was served very differently than my dosa (see my photos).  While mine was the dramatically large rolled crepe with filling loosely placed in the middle, his was wrapped into a tight, burrito-like structure.  Both were very tasty, and a bit spicy, but not too spicy.  I liked the crispy \"chips\" that they give in the beginning of the meal (like tortilla chips in Mexican places). and also the fact that the dosas came with two different chuneys (a tomato based one and a bean based one, I think) to dip, and also a small bowl of lentil/veggie soup called sambar.  Two dosas for the two of us was $25 w/o tip and we were stuffed silly.

The papadum, unfortunately, was a salt lick, as if someone simply paid no attention to how much salt was added. The chile and onion pakora was nice, but mucking up a chickpea-batter fritter is nearly impossible. Is it too heavy? No. Is it too greasy? No. Done.

The Tamil lamb curry, which they serve with the lemon rice, was good enough; and that, in the end, was the 'flaw' with everything - all was good, nothing great, and I'd rather eat at Vik's Chaat (Berkeley) any day of the week. Dosa's 'organic' sourcing and product pride is well and fine, but better flavor is better flavor. The 'Southern' influence of Dosa's cuisine is not much of an inducement (I thought it would be); it's not especially distinguished in its spicing from what you find in other Indian restaurants. I'll be honest with you - next time I'm in the area looking for an Indian meal, I'll try Udupi Palace instead, and I'm no vegetarian, so take that as you will, yeah? In sum: fine service, enjoyable space, good food, a nice wine and liquor selection; but if the brilliant originality and power of Indian cuisine is your one true thing, there is better to be had without the frills or extra bills.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-11-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Rava masala dosa, masala dosa, and rasmalai were delicious and authentic.

The hostess said that we had to come in person to give our name and party number on that day.  So, on my birthday, my hubby got home earlier than usual to put his name on the list and then came to pick us up. When we got to the restaurant we still had more time to wait.  What bothered me was that they were sitting a party of 8 from a reservation that did not exist when I tried unsuccessfully to make a reservation.  Also, I think the restaurant setup is really nice but they could maybe update the bathroom to match the high-scale setting of the place.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-12-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Dahi Vada, Paper Masala Dosa, and Paneer and Peas Uttapam", ".

All were good, and the presentation on the DV was notable.  The sambar was kinda boring, if I wanted to complain, and the coconut sorbet was way too sweet for my taste, but not bad.\n\nRegarding some common criticisms:\n\nFirst of all, you can count your alternatives for S. Indian on one hand.  Yes, one of the those is a hop away, but none of them fill the niche that this does.   You could go here without worrying that your date would be overdressed, and as someone who is perfectly happy eating off a thali and even appreciates something Bollywood playing up on the wall, and generally prefers typical \"ethnic\" joints for being relatively casual (and cheap) as well as relatively tasty, I very much enjoyed a more upscale, polished environment for a change.  Going here felt like a special occasion, but it was still comfortable.\n\nSecond, the food is actually pretty good.   That it is more expensive to eat here than the alternatives is no surprise.  You are paying for more than food.   And really, it isn't expensive when you consider that.  And it isn't like you are eating something from Chat Cafe, prettied up, either.  The food just wasn't mind blowing or anything.  Maybe if I'd made it to Vik's or Udupi, I'd be less forgiving, but it isn't like I haven't had better elsewhere.

Following a lengthy discussion on how good they weren't, our food finally arrived.\n\nThe soup and dosa were both inoffensive, if a bit coarsely seasoned.  However, the \"sunny side up\" eggs were raw.  I like my eggs runnier than most and would gladly take underdone eggs to overcooked ones.  We were ultimately treated to both at Dosa.   Now when I say raw, I mean RAW.  The whites looked like a pool of translucent snot.  Literally.  Translucent.  Snot.  When we were finally able to flag down our waitress (no small feat, I assure you), she advised us that \"that is the way you ordered them.  You said 'sunny side up' and that's the way they're cooked.\"  She apparently missed the point that they were not cooked.  She tapped my girlfriend on the arm, and said with a great deal of presumptive condescension, \"I'm just letting you know how to order for the next time.\"  Her tone and demeanor clearly expressed her belief that we knew nothing about the food we were ordering.  (I should mention here, I am a former professional chef of several years).  However, this was not haute cuisine.  This was not even ethnic cuisine.  This was a sunny-side up egg.  There's no requirement for a refined palate in this instance.  It's an egg.  You put in a frying pan.  You COOK it. \n\nFinally, after she continued arguing with us and refusing to acknowledge that the egg was uncooked, I ran my finger through the translucent snot, at which point she picked up the plate and clearly annoyed, said she would fix it.  The plate returned a few minutes later, with the same eggs that were now completely overcooked with a burnt crispy bottom and hard yolks.   \n\nFor this splendid feast, we were set back a mere 40+ dollars.

I am South Indian and am amazed that any other South Indian person could approve of the food here.   I would have much less of an issue if the place said it was \"inspired\" by South Indian flavors, but to call it an authentic South Indian restaurant is insane; all you need to do is take one trip there to realize immediately that this crap is not served in real Indian restaurants.\n\nTHE SERVICE: we showed up at 9:30 pm on a Friday night.  To Dosa's credit, a twenty minute wait meant a twenty minute wait; however, that was the only thing that went right.  The bartender clearly gave preference to the white people seated at the bar, serving and paying attention to white patrons who clearly arrived after I did.  When he finally came around to me, I asked loudly and clearly for the drinks menu; he returned with the food menu.  It took literally 10 minutes to get his attention, all the while being completely ignored by the useless barback.  He seemed annoyed when I asked for the correct menu and didn't come back for another 10 minutes.  Just as he was done pouring our drinks, the hostess came to seat us.  She was forced to wait on us while rudy mcrudetender took his time closing our bar tab.  The drink, by the way, was the pomegranate garnet and it tasted like Strawberry Shortcake had vomited into my glass.\n\nTHE MENU: appalling.  First of all, I can't believe this place can get away with serving heavily overpriced breakfast food as somewhat classy dinner food.  Secondly, none of the \"curries\" on the menu are  authentic -- I dare anyone to tell me when they've seen such dishes on mom's table, in the way that Dosa prepares them.  The salad and soups section is hilarious -- we don't eat that stuff in India, at least not in the western sense of the words.  Give me cucumber pachadi any day.\n\nTHE FOOD: I ordered the mung sprouts salad, rava masala dosa, and salty lassi.  The salad was fine, just not authentic.  The dosa was ... disappointing at best.  Nice and thin, but soggy rather than crispy.  The masala, rather than being stuffed in the center, was underneath the tri-fold of dosa -- how the hell was I supposed to reach it without making a mess? I was expecting at least some delicious coconut chutney and perhaps coriander chutney.  What I got were some strange tomato (?) chutney that I've never seen on a South Indian table, and a garlicky, runny version of coconut chutney.  The lassi was terrible -- more sweet than salty, and with strange spices that I've only ever tasted in North Indian versions of lassi.\n\nTHE LANGUAGE BARRIER: imagine, a South Indian having a language barrier at a South Indian restaurant?? Well, that's what you get from the awkward kurti-laden servers at Dosa.  I had to resort to hideously Americanized pronunciations (it's not Lassy the dog, people!) and had to endure a night full of hearing these girls take requests for \"doe-sah\" and \"oo-tah-pom.\" ugh.\n\nI would rather make the trek down to the south bay for real dinner (rassam, more kozhambu, bisi bele bath, etc.) or authentic breakfast food than ever set foot in Dosa again. \n\nI would never, ever bring my parents to eat here if they visited.

The avocado chaat with grapefruit and coconut had a surprising raw chile flavor from habaneros that really packed a punch! One of my favorite dishes of the night was the lamb kebab pav sliders--the lamb was so tender and it was served with a yogurt and red pepper chutney sauce that brought the whole sandwich together! The sliders were also surprisingly spicy, so do be warned--but the flavors were absolutely incredible.\n\nThen on to the dosas! The best part of the huge masala dosa was the thin, crispy lentil batter crepe, and we also had the paneer and peas dosa, which was a dosa wrapped around a mixture of peas and paneer. Both of these came with two different chutneys (my favorite was the cooling coconut mint chutney) as well as a lentil soup, all of which were perfect for dipping with torn pieces of dosa.\n\nFinally, for our main course, we had the incredible green mango halibut curry.

The chicken was coated and fried with a great cumin flavor. The calamari was definitely my favorite of the two though. The hints of coconut milk come out and give it a great balance and the calamari was perfectly tender. \n\nSecond course was the Spicy mung masala dosa and Paneer and peas dosa.

You've been warned. \n\nWe finished off with the pepper chicken and pepper lamb with rice and yogurt. These were alright and honestly probably the weakest part of the night. Both were a little bit too salty for my taste, but they both had a great flavor profile (whatever the means). \n\nI will now digress. \n\nIf you have read all you need to know to convince you to go to Dosa, please stop reading.

Also, who wouldn't want to have bourbon from a bottle which has an awesome old dude smoking a cigar? \n\nAnyways, look this is a great place and you should go check it out for yourself.

Next came our Bhatura. Definitely a surprise to see a giant inflated dough ball. It's BIGGER THAN YOUR FACE (and mine combined)! I snapped a photo of it before it started deflating -- and then it was just flat bread and not as exciting. It was a tad on the oily side, but great with the dipping sauces. \n\nWe both agreed that the best dipping sauce, by far, was the Baby Eggplant chutney. I also liked the Cilantro/Mint flavors - both were light and refreshing. The Tamarind definitely has a sour kick to it, so try a little bit first. If you're feeling adventurous, try the Habanero. I tried a dime sized drop - despite the hotness, it also tastes sweet. \n\nMy Mysore Dosa was delicious!! Of course, I do have an unhealthy love for potatoes. The crepe itself was big, slightly chewy, and partially filled with creamy spiced potatoes with onions and cashews. I think I would've preferred less dough because it was folded so a big portion was not filled with anything. I ended up using the Sambar (lentil dipping soup) more than the Tomato and fresh Coconut Chutney. All three came with the Dosa for dipping. The Paneer and Peas Dosa was wrapped like a burrito, and cut so you could see the filling. The cheese looked like scrambled eggs, so I kept thinking I was going to eat eggs and peas. It was also tasty and not too pea-y. \n\nOverall the service was attentive and very helpful, everything was delicious, but just slightly pricey.  However, with all the food that you get, it's not too bad.

Like in other big cities, it's a relief to encounter a little bit of down-to-earthiness. \n\nWhen I went, I just couldn't stop eating as if a metronome was commanding me to place scrumptious bites into my mouth from the Prawn  Chili Fry to the Rasmalai. Like a fellow reviewer, I too went from a food trance into a food coma. I hurried home, changed into my least restrictive pj's and kicked back on the sofa for an hour, until I resurfaced from that same euphoria and went with my gf and friend over to Little Baobabs.\n\nFor entrees: the Tamil Vegetable Curry has texture and seasonings like nothing else, Paneer and Peas Dosa will satisfy the Paneer fiend, and the Chile and Cilantro Uttapam had a great crunch to it.  Unfortunately, the Chutney Masala Dosa had a filling too thin and slippery to top my list. \n\nI was considering giving the place 4 stars because it's a little pricey, but I think the food and the atmosphere speak for themselves. My Indian friend with whom we had dinner recognized the owner from a family wedding. This made me eye him curiously throughout the night and I have to say that I liked the way he seemed to stay calm, aware and active- not that I know anything about restaurant management. \n\nDosa is for rare occasions, since the price tops similar formidable taste establishments: Udupi for Indian food or Osha for Thai.

A lot of my friends who came before suggested that I try out the drinks they had. I tried out the Peony, which was delicious. I never thought mixing milk and alchol outside of a White Russian would be any good, but this was creamy and good. Some of my friends had a variety of other drinks, I think another group favorite was the Port of Call which was a spiked tea with a side of peanuts. For my second drink I had the Aaraam Se, which I was intrigued by the sheer fascination as to what I would get. I don't really remember what it was and it wasn't particularly distinct, so I would say to stick with one of their premade drinks. It is a cool experience none the less to just name off your favorite flavor and the bartender to just concoct something. \n\nAs for food, I started by splitting a plate of Vada Pav which was delicious. The side salad it came with was a nice added bonus and wasn't just a bunch of greens on a plate but rather well made. The Vada Pav was cooked great and had the masala and spice of a more traditional vada pav. Now to main course, and I didn't feel vindicated eating at dosa without having one of their dosas. I chose the White Truffle Dosa due to a recommendation from a friend and enjoyed the meal but definitely didn't think it was that much different than an average dosa I would get from home.

We knew the restaurant was going to be a huge success because the food was so amazing. We loved it. We probably went at least 30 times and when Dosa Fillmore opened we frequented that one because it was closer to where we live. We didn't think Fillmore was quite as good as Valencia but it was still excellent.\nFor some unknown reason we stopped going some years ago. No one reason in particular, I think we just got excited about other cuisines and places and lost interest.\nWe went back to the original Valencia location last night with a couple friends. I knew exactly what I wanted to order and was pleased most if not everything I used to love is still on the menu. A few highlights:\n\n- Lamb sliders. These things were awesome. Heat level is INSANE. I applaud the chef for having the nerve to put as much heat into those things as they do. I nearly choked at first as I inhaled a tiny chunk of the lamb and the heat seared the back of my throat. All good. That's the kind of burn anyone who likes spicy food should love. The quality of the lamb which was finely ground was also superb. \n- Chennai chicken. This is always good, however it used to be better. The chicken used to just explode on the palate with various spices and heat, and the accompanying yogurt sauce cooled it perfectly. Now it is more like a standard fare chicken and the sauce is kind of boring. Disappointed but still pretty good.\n- Dahi Vada. This one was the major letdown of the evening. This dish used to be spectacular. It was served in a nice size bowl with a spiderweb thread of yogurt and sauce that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven. Now it is served in one of these gourmet bowls that really allow them to give you half as much and gone is the intricate artwork on top. It still tastes similar but nowhere close to how awesome it used to be. I really think Anjan should restore this dish to its former glory. It was one of the best dishes I've ever encountered anywhere.\n- Corn Poriyal. Very good, refreshing corn spiced perfectly which was a nice break from the heavy flavors everywhere else.\n- White Truffle Dosa. Spot on. As I'd expect from all of the dosas, this one was just as I remembered it and 100% delicious and awesome. \n- Caramelized onion Uttapam. Very good but I didn't think it was very unique. Just ok.\n- Channa Batura. Pretty close to how I remember it and it was usually one of the dishes we loved the most. It still comes out with a gargantuan wheat bread ready to explode with steam in the middle and the divine chickpeas. It is still awesome. I think it used to be a smidgen better but it is still wonderful. \n- We ordered a few rice dishes and a veggie curry also which I thought were good but not the highlight of the meal so I won't go into great detail. \n\nI hope this provides a good review for your consideration of Dosa.

This was perfect because we could eat until the countdown and they were giving out complimentary champagne and party favors.  The restaurant was about 75-80% filled at the countdown which wasn't bad.  Everyone was happy and noisy.\n\nThere was a 4-course NYE menu for $49/person which was a LOT of food. You're basically getting 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert.  My husband for the prix fixed and I got one entree.  Below was his 4 course dinner:\n\n--Appetizer: Chicken Kebabs.  They're like spicy and delicate chicken patties with this amazing cilantro sauce.  People were hesitant to order this because I'm sure in their minds they were expecting overcooked white meat on skewers.  This was not the case at all.\n\n--Entree 1: You can choose either a dosas or uttapams.  I tried the white truffle dosa and after sharing this one person, we were both veering on the full side.  This is a BIG pancake.  I couldn't really taste the white truffle.\n\n--Entree 2: Goat curry.  The meat pieces were bone-in and so incredibly tender.  I loved the dish.  The accompanying rice had a strong lemon flavor that went well with the goat.  The downside is that there are quite a few bones to pick through the dark sauce.\n\n--Dessert: Tearamisu.  It's their take on the tiramisu using paneer and chai both in the cake and in the chocolate-chai sauce.  Almost better than the original.  It's like drinking chai.\n\nAnd my single entree was the Kerala Chicken which looks like a dish of really poo green mush but is so AWESOME!  I couldn't stop smelling each spoonful before the bite because the fragrance of the coconut milk was so enticing.  I don't think I've ever really done that before.  I do agree with some other Yelpers who say that the non-dosas are better than the dosas so be sure to order other items such as this.\n\nDrinks were also well made and they have a section of spice-filled drinks.  Get ready for cumin, chili, and cardamom.  I got the Gunpowder which is Antiguo Reposado tequila, gunpowder agave, lemon, elderflower, and grilled mezcal pineapple.  I was worried this would taste too strong but the bartender reassured me that the other ingredients help to mask and balance out the tequila which it did.  \n\nMy drink did come pretty late but other than that, service was top notch.

It's not that we haven't found really delicious food here, but it's just nothing has been better than what I have had previously.\n\nDosa, was perfect.

Dosa completely changed that.  \n\nWe got the tasting menu for $35, which btw, what a great deal.  \nCalamari appetizer - divine, perfectly cooked texture and the taste was unique but amazing, definitely not your typical calamari.  It was my favorite dish of the night, if I had to choose.  \n\nWatermelon salad - just because it sounded, well, interesting, and it was very refreshing, the combination of the sweetness of the watermelon really balanced the other Indian spices\n\nDosas - we had both the white truffle dosa, and the paneer dosa (cheese).  both were delicious and came with three sauces.  I think the most amazing thing is the fact that you really do get layers of flavors, especially with the sauce, where your initial taste buds are stimulated by the sauces, then by, for example the flavor of the truffle.  Usually, with sauces, you just taste the combination of the food and sauce at once, but there was such a clear layer of different flavors that explode in your mouth gradually, which was amazing (like that scene from Ratatouille!!!)\n\nLamb tamil - very soft lamb, absolutely cooked to the perfect degree where the meat was just coming apart very easily, delicious.  comes with this citrus rice, which takes a bit of getting used, I couldn't really get used to it and probably would ask for a milder seasoned rice next time\n\nPrawn curry - the curry was absolutely delicious, one of the best I've ever had.  I do have to say the shrimp was a bit underseasoned, which is weird given the sauce is amazing.  it was almost that you taste this amazing sauce, and as you get into the texture of the shrimp, which was perfect, the flavor falls  bit flat... \n\nService was absolutely amazing.

Upon entering, we were greeted with a friendly hostess and the amazing smell of Indian spices, a nice comforting feeling on one of those super chilly San Francisco nights.

If you've never had it, stop what you're doing right now. \n\nSeriously. Stop it. \n\nGo find Dosa and make damn sure it's good. Better yet, put Dosa on your GPS and get here now. \n\nThis place does not disappoint, not in the least bit. There's a little bit of everything here for everyone, lamb lovers, chicken lovers, vegetarians, Indian cheese lovers (yes this is a thing). \n\nTonight, we ended up tasting from the Dine about Town Menu which gave us an opportunity to try a couple things we normally wouldn't have. \n\nWe started off with the Cochin calamari and Chennai Chicken. The chicken was coated and fried with a great cumin flavor. The calamari was definitely my favorite of the two though. The hints of coconut milk come out and give it a great balance and the calamari was perfectly tender. \n\nSecond course was the Spicy mung masala dosa and Paneer and peas dosa. The Spicy mung dosa had a decent amount of heat to it and I found it a little bit harder to eat. I'm typically not a huge fan of mung (just the word sounds gross...mung...mung...bleh) but this dish was definitely tolerable and probably good if you actually like mung (bleh). Now Paneer I have a special place in my Indian stomach for. \n\nI will eat paneer like it is my f***ing job. \n\nThis particular dosa was incredibly flavorful, which can sometimes be hard because paneer often just takes over the flavor of whatever it's in, kind of like an indian tofu mozzarella cube. \n\nMy only gripe is that my friend I was eating with is an asshole. Now if you have read any of my yelp reviews, you'll know that spice is not always my friend. Well spice reared it's ugly head again and beat me mercilessly into submission. \n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nDo not, I repeat, do not order the Mango habanero sauce unless you are prepared to be clutching a pillow for the next two hours, deduced to nothing but a puddle of heat sweats and shear pain. This is not white person \"OMG, LIKE JALAPENOS ARE SO HOT\" hot. No, it's \"I rub ghost chilis in my eyes for fun\" hot. It's flavorful, you think it's okay, then you start getting adventurous and put more and more on there. Then you realize that the enamel on your teeth have begun to wear down from the fumes. You've been warned. \n\nWe finished off with the pepper chicken and pepper lamb with rice and yogurt. These were alright and honestly probably the weakest part of the night. Both were a little bit too salty for my taste, but they both had a great flavor profile (whatever the means). \n\nI will now digress. \n\nIf you have read all you need to know to convince you to go to Dosa, please stop reading. But for the love of all that is great in this world (see puppies, ice cream, and Nicholas Cage), they have Pappy Van Winkle here. \n\nThere are few bars, restaurants, homes, etc. in San Francisco that have Pappy Van Winkle. For those that are unaware to the world of bourbon, Pappy (in this case a 15 year) is the pinnacle of good bourbon. It's about $18 for a pour, which is actually really cheap for this particular blend, and you will be so much happier after having it. Also, who wouldn't want to have bourbon from a bottle which has an awesome old dude smoking a cigar? \n\nAnyways, look this is a great place and you should go check it out for yourself. The staff is pretty friendly, and the wait isn't too bad, provided you're willing to sit at the bar.

Been here a couple times, and I've liked every single thing I've tried so far. Plus the papadums (lentil chips) they give you to start with are DELICIOUS ... I inhale them all in 30 seconds and have to ask for another bowl.\n\nPani Puri - These gems are AMAZEBALLS. 7 little pani puris for $8 - I would say this was the best appetizer. It was on a special mini appetizer menu so I don't know if they always have them, so get them while you can! Pani puris are little hollow crispy flour balls, and you poke a hole on top. Then they give you 3 items to fill it with (chickpeas, mashed potato, and mung beans) and then they give you 2 sauces (a slightly spicy mint chutney (sauce) and slightly sweet tamarind chutney) to pour on top. The guy who served them to us was so nice, and asked us if we knew how to eat them (we didn't), and expertly showed us how to make one/made one for us! The mint chutney was seriously YUM and I literally ate it by itself and poured it on everything else I ate the rest of dinner.\n\nCrispy Fish Pakora - These are SO good! Little fried fish sticks. But now that I've had them a couple times, I'm starting to think they're not worth the $$$ (5 sticks for $11). Good to try if you've never had them before, though, and they didn't have them at the Fillmore location when I went.\n\nChennai Chicken ($9.5) - This was also very small but very delicious and flavorful, and comes with yogurt for dipping. ($9.50)\n\nLamb Pepper Fry ($19.5) - Good tender lamb but a little salty (and now that I'm looking at the menu prices, expensive too holy cow!). Very small for the price - think one cup of curry. We got it with the lemon rice ($3) but everyone said was good but personally, I'm not a big sour fan, so I'd probably go for coconut next time.\n\nChanna Bhatura ($15) - \"BIG PUFFY THING\" - GET THIS! Fight with your friends over who gets to be the first to rip a hole and deflate the steaming bhatura. Slightly sweet, slightly crispy, and slightly chewy. You will have leftover chickpea masala so you can eat it with the rice or dosa or something later on.\n\nSpicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck. Really good! Basically a giant crepe folded over with mashed potatoes in the middle. It also comes with a lentil soup, which you can also eat with rice too wooot!\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa ($12) - If you come here a lot like me and get bored of the Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, you should get this one! The filling is the normal potato/onion/cashew mix you you'd expect, but with truffle oil. I love truffle oil and you can really taste it here! \n\nFennel and Spinach Dosa ($13) - This one's a little different from the other dosas. Instead of one big crepe, they divide it into a couple of smaller rolled up crepes. And it doesn't have masala, so there are no potatoes, and the filling is sauteed spinach and more vegetable-y. I personally like the other two dosas listed above better.\n\nUttapam: South Indian Moons ($14) - These weren't BAD, but they were nowhere as good as the other dishes. This was a sampler of all five uttapams and they were all pretty unimpressive, and kind of all tasted the same. Kind of like a small thick not-sweet pancake with different things on top.

Most Indian places in town are N. Indian and Pakistani and are either way overpriced or kind of divey. Either could work depending on your tastes, but Dosa brings something wholly different to the party. Since it serves S. Indian, Dosa's regional specialty is also its namesake: flat, spongy rice pancakes of bread that conceal a collage of spices, flavors and ingredients (reminiscent of Ethiopian food in its composition and textures, if not its flavors). The spicy mung masala dosa is fantastic (green chiles, spicy potatoes and lentils), as are the somosas and the peppercorn chicken (comes in a thick sauce that mixes heavenly with a side of rice).\n\nWhat you won't find here are the tika masalas, naans and tandoori dishes served by about 90% of all Indian restaurants in town. \n\nFinally, while I didn't have dessert, an after dinner spiced Indian coffee was without question the best coffee drink I've ever had. \n\nThe wine list is substantial and the servers are skilled at recommending wines.

Unfortunately, it takes more than just food to satisfy me.\n\nThere is a wait.  There is a wait of epic proportions.  I might as well have brought the latest Harry Potter book, but luckily I had many good friends around to chat-up with.  From my estimates we were waiting a total of 2+ hours to be seated.  That's ridiculous.  Even for a Friday night.\n\nLooking over the menu, I spotted the first page, which contains a fixed-price ($35 at time of this writing) that allows you to choose a soup/salad, mini-dosa, curry, and dessert.  I always like to choose from this menu because it allows for a great variety of sampling at a moderate cost...and it reminds me of Europe.  Unfortunately, after selected all of my dishes, the waitress comes up and tells me that if the majority of our table (of 8) does not order from the fixed-price selection then I cannot either.  This made me actually angry.  If I was alone I would have left right then and there.\n\nSo, hurriedly I selected some other options from the base of the menu.\n\nHere's what I chose:\nOrganic Greens, Mango & Goat's Feta - $9\nRava Masala Dosa - $11\nIce Water - $0 (Thankfully!)\n\nSticker shock?  Yeah...that's a bit high, especially for a dosa.  San Francisco eating ain't cheap.  Dosas in the South Bay can be found easily for $5 or less.\n\nThe salad was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Good balance of flavors and portion size was as expected.  Just nothing stood out on this dish.  You can make this one at home.  Buy one of those goat cheese and walnut salads in the prepackaged salad aisle of the grocery store plus a mango and Whalaaa!\n\nThe dosa was...awesome.  Possibly the best Dosa I've ever had.  Granted, I've never had this type (Rava) of Dosa before.  Maybe that was the factor that swayed me so much.  Also, I think I've had maybe 10-15 dosas in my entire life...so not a huge pool we're sampling from.  Oh, and some were buffet dosas.  Anyways, I'll give Dosa credit to their name.  This was the highlight of my visit.\n\nDosa might be better as a street stand selling delicious dosas - allowing easier access and concentrating on their craft.  I think the only time I will ever return is if I can be assured that the wait time is not more than 1 hour and they allow me to order whatever I want from the menu.

I am South Indian and am amazed that any other South Indian person could approve of the food here.   I would have much less of an issue if the place said it was \"inspired\" by South Indian flavors, but to call it an authentic South Indian restaurant is insane; all you need to do is take one trip there to realize immediately that this crap is not served in real Indian restaurants.\n\nTHE SERVICE: we showed up at 9:30 pm on a Friday night.  To Dosa's credit, a twenty minute wait meant a twenty minute wait; however, that was the only thing that went right.  The bartender clearly gave preference to the white people seated at the bar, serving and paying attention to white patrons who clearly arrived after I did.  When he finally came around to me, I asked loudly and clearly for the drinks menu; he returned with the food menu.  It took literally 10 minutes to get his attention, all the while being completely ignored by the useless barback.  He seemed annoyed when I asked for the correct menu and didn't come back for another 10 minutes.  Just as he was done pouring our drinks, the hostess came to seat us.  She was forced to wait on us while rudy mcrudetender took his time closing our bar tab.  The drink, by the way, was the pomegranate garnet and it tasted like Strawberry Shortcake had vomited into my glass.\n\nTHE MENU: appalling.  First of all, I can't believe this place can get away with serving heavily overpriced breakfast food as somewhat classy dinner food.  Secondly, none of the \"curries\" on the menu are  authentic -- I dare anyone to tell me when they've seen such dishes on mom's table, in the way that Dosa prepares them.  The salad and soups section is hilarious -- we don't eat that stuff in India, at least not in the western sense of the words.  Give me cucumber pachadi any day.\n\nTHE FOOD: I ordered the mung sprouts salad, rava masala dosa, and salty lassi.  The salad was fine, just not authentic.  The dosa was ... disappointing at best.  Nice and thin, but soggy rather than crispy.  The masala, rather than being stuffed in the center, was underneath the tri-fold of dosa -- how the hell was I supposed to reach it without making a mess? I was expecting at least some delicious coconut chutney and perhaps coriander chutney.  What I got were some strange tomato (?) chutney that I've never seen on a South Indian table, and a garlicky, runny version of coconut chutney.  The lassi was terrible -- more sweet than salty, and with strange spices that I've only ever tasted in North Indian versions of lassi.\n\nTHE LANGUAGE BARRIER: imagine, a South Indian having a language barrier at a South Indian restaurant?? Well, that's what you get from the awkward kurti-laden servers at Dosa.  I had to resort to hideously Americanized pronunciations (it's not Lassy the dog, people!) and had to endure a night full of hearing these girls take requests for \"doe-sah\" and \"oo-tah-pom.\" ugh.\n\nI would rather make the trek down to the south bay for real dinner (rassam, more kozhambu, bisi bele bath, etc.) or authentic breakfast food than ever set foot in Dosa again. \n\nI would never, ever bring my parents to eat here if they visited.

We decided that everyone would order one plate (after a round of appetizers) and we would pass it around so people could try everything. When the dishes came I was surprised that there were so many dosas. I remember thinking that's weird that we all have the same tastes and got dosas. Well, hello, the name of this restaurant is Dosa because they specialize in dosas! I'm glad my husband wasn't there to witness that moment because I'd never live it down (although he sometimes reads my Yelp reviews, so if you're reading this, don't say anything).\n\nDigression aside, you really should order a dosa. That's what they are known for and they are delicious. If you see the pictures, you'll notice that they are huge! I looked at it and thought I can't eat it all. False! Since they are hollow on the inside other than the filling, you can eat it all if you truly believe! (Kidding aside, I found myself slightly on the fuller side of full by the end, but not uncomfortably so). \n\nWe started with the Dahi Vada, Lemon-Chile Scallops, Spiced Avocado Chaat (which we asked them to make not spicy so we nixed the habanero), and the Southern Samosas.

If anyone is reading this during the week of Restaurant week (Jan 18- 29) first thing I have to mention is that the menu on the site is NOT the same as what they are serving in store! Hopefully they change that... but just a heads up, I actually think it's better because it includes more options of small plates and a choice of dessert.\n\nMy roommate and I (whom I'm sure you'll see her reviews of this place too ;) (shout to to you Marcie!) decided we had to finally try this place after hearing all about it and of course, realizing it was the best RW deal! So the two of us made a reservation and came here along with my boyfriend.\n\nA couple things to note about restaurant week: as a table you pick 3 small dishes, 3 main dishes and 2 desserts and you share with the table. The waitress will portion it between however many people you have. I think the best deal is coming with 2 people but in any case, the servers are really good at making sure there is enough food so even with a big group, I'm sure it would be great :)\n\nWe decided to pick the following:\nSmall Plates:\n- Red Beet and Cumin Soup\nThis was super good! Nicely spiced with a perfect bit of sweetness, this was like a gazpacho (except warm) or like a tomato soup, except with beets. Super smooth and luxuriously rich with a ton of amazing flavor. Definitely going to try and imitate it ourselves! It seems simple but so good and perfect to warm up your soul\n\n- Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad\nThis was nice--nothing to speak lengths about but it had lentils and a nice crunch from the mung bean. It was pretty refreshing overall, nice and light but also very filling. Ours came with only two small pieces of paneer and we each had a solid couple spoonfuls to try it. \n\n- Chennai Chicken\nOMG so bombass. This was super good, moist and delicious chicken (probably the thighs) and it was covered in a crust and deep fried. It came with this yummy yogurt marinade and all three of us could not stop eating it it was so good, The perfect little appetizer and a taste for all palates :P\n\nMain Dishes:\n- Shrimp Biryani\nThis was really good, a sort of fried rice mixture with really soft rice and a bunch of spices plus a couple of mix ins and some shrimp. We got maybe 4-5 pieces of shrimp and a good helping of rice. This was a great compliment to the meal and just an overall solid option.\n\n- Lamb Keema (Dosa)\nIn case you don't know, a dosa is almost like a mixture of a crepe and like a chip--it's fried on one side so that it's crispy and the other side is a little bit doughy but overall, the dosa at Dosa is pretty thin--great as like a cripsy and flour tortilla in one or a one sided crispy injera (yea, poor description but the closest I can think of!). You'll fill it with sauces, and mixings, just as you would like a taco or crepe or like Injera (ethiopian pancake). Our dosa came with this really nice spiced lamp mixture with some potatoes and on the sides we also got this like coconut green sauce, a spicy red sauce, and a big bowl of this reddish orange curry. Overall it was delicious, especially just mixing everything together!\n\n- Organic Mushroom and Arugula Uttapam\nThis was basically like a pancake--it reminded me a lot of a vietnamese pancake or a part pancake, part omlette-y crepe. It was filled with delicious mushrooms and truffle oil and topped with fresh arugula. This also came with the chutneys and assorted dips which really complimented the dish. We described it as kind of like a pizza pancake aha\n\nDessert:\n- Pistachio Barfi\nThis was a decadant little chocolate sort of cake. So good.... layers of cashew milk fudge with pistachios, ganache and all sorts of goodies layered into a perfect little cake. Its a small serving but so rich that we barely finished it given the small piece we recieved!\n\n- Mango Sorbet\nThe best kind of sorbet period. You really can't go wrong with this, it's the besttttt\n\nAnd that's that! At $42 a person and then additional tax and tip, it was a TON of food and RW was a great way to taste so much of their menu without breaking the bank, since this place is normally pretty high end. The food is really outstanding though and I know I would definitely be back and recommend this to friends. We were all STUFFED and I'm so happy I took advantage of this deal.

I ordered the South Indian Moons Uttapam and found the lil' pancakes that came mushy and not all great, depending on what was in them (the onion and peas & onion were good, but the one with peas and red something or other was awful--and, one of them had cooked cashews! ugh!).  However, I did adore the channa (best I've had) and chutneys that came with them (best mixed together!), but hated the sambar (too thick and sour for me).  Overall, I'd say it was worth a try, but not at all worth the $13 price tag.  No way.\n3. For starters we had the Vada Sambar (you can probably guess from the comments above that I hated this dish), which comes with gooey dumplings (yuck) in sambar (double yuck), and the Dahi Vada, a lentil dumpling in yogurt and spices.  I have to say, I really enjoyed the Dahi Vada (particularly the presentation--it was beautiful with white and brown striping, you just have to see it) but again the price just wasn't worth it ($7 each).\n\nOther folks in my party ordered the lamb curry, which they said was amazing, the mysore dosa (so-so), and the seafood curry (okay).  Adding in three beers, our bill (including tip) came to about $120.  I think that's waaay too overpriced for what we got.  And, yes, the decor is pretty, but it was noisy, hot, and folks were crowded together (waiters were literally tripping over people). \n\nSo, even though it's good to try new things, I will probably not be going back.", "rating": 2, "date": "2006-08-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Medu vada, South Indian tomato soup, South Indian Moons uttapam.\n\n"], "author": "Keith C.", "review": "I've been hit with a \"dosa\" reality lately.

Dosa and Amber India are the only places that my friends from Bangalore, India were impressed with.  That's a good indicator of the authenticity of the food.  However, I would skip the appetizers.

The South Indian Tomato soup, described as delicately flavored with spices, could have been the \"fire broth\" as far as I was concerned.  There was nothing delicate about it.  Thankfully, the dosas and curries hit the spot, especially the paneer dosa (highlight of the night), chatni masala dosa and lentil chicken, which was so tender.  I didn't care so much for the South Indian Moon Uttapam, which felt like a waste of money and came with the same damn chutneys and sambar we got with the appetizer.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake, the most non-Indian dessert on the menu, and it wasn't half bad.\n\nService:  2 stars.  Our server was clueless.

We knew the restaurant was going to be a huge success because the food was so amazing. We loved it. We probably went at least 30 times and when Dosa Fillmore opened we frequented that one because it was closer to where we live. We didn't think Fillmore was quite as good as Valencia but it was still excellent.\nFor some unknown reason we stopped going some years ago. No one reason in particular, I think we just got excited about other cuisines and places and lost interest.\nWe went back to the original Valencia location last night with a couple friends. I knew exactly what I wanted to order and was pleased most if not everything I used to love is still on the menu. A few highlights:\n\n- Lamb sliders. These things were awesome. Heat level is INSANE. I applaud the chef for having the nerve to put as much heat into those things as they do. I nearly choked at first as I inhaled a tiny chunk of the lamb and the heat seared the back of my throat. All good. That's the kind of burn anyone who likes spicy food should love. The quality of the lamb which was finely ground was also superb. \n- Chennai chicken. This is always good, however it used to be better. The chicken used to just explode on the palate with various spices and heat, and the accompanying yogurt sauce cooled it perfectly. Now it is more like a standard fare chicken and the sauce is kind of boring. Disappointed but still pretty good.\n- Dahi Vada. This one was the major letdown of the evening. This dish used to be spectacular. It was served in a nice size bowl with a spiderweb thread of yogurt and sauce that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven. Now it is served in one of these gourmet bowls that really allow them to give you half as much and gone is the intricate artwork on top. It still tastes similar but nowhere close to how awesome it used to be. I really think Anjan should restore this dish to its former glory. It was one of the best dishes I've ever encountered anywhere.\n- Corn Poriyal. Very good, refreshing corn spiced perfectly which was a nice break from the heavy flavors everywhere else.\n- White Truffle Dosa. Spot on. As I'd expect from all of the dosas, this one was just as I remembered it and 100% delicious and awesome. \n- Caramelized onion Uttapam. Very good but I didn't think it was very unique. Just ok.\n- Channa Batura. Pretty close to how I remember it and it was usually one of the dishes we loved the most. It still comes out with a gargantuan wheat bread ready to explode with steam in the middle and the divine chickpeas. It is still awesome. I think it used to be a smidgen better but it is still wonderful. \n- We ordered a few rice dishes and a veggie curry also which I thought were good but not the highlight of the meal so I won't go into great detail. \n\nI hope this provides a good review for your consideration of Dosa.

Been here a couple times, and I've liked every single thing I've tried so far. Plus the papadums (lentil chips) they give you to start with are DELICIOUS ... I inhale them all in 30 seconds and have to ask for another bowl.\n\nPani Puri - These gems are AMAZEBALLS. 7 little pani puris for $8 - I would say this was the best appetizer. It was on a special mini appetizer menu so I don't know if they always have them, so get them while you can! Pani puris are little hollow crispy flour balls, and you poke a hole on top. Then they give you 3 items to fill it with (chickpeas, mashed potato, and mung beans) and then they give you 2 sauces (a slightly spicy mint chutney (sauce) and slightly sweet tamarind chutney) to pour on top. The guy who served them to us was so nice, and asked us if we knew how to eat them (we didn't), and expertly showed us how to make one/made one for us! The mint chutney was seriously YUM and I literally ate it by itself and poured it on everything else I ate the rest of dinner.\n\nCrispy Fish Pakora - These are SO good! Little fried fish sticks. But now that I've had them a couple times, I'm starting to think they're not worth the $$$ (5 sticks for $11). Good to try if you've never had them before, though, and they didn't have them at the Fillmore location when I went.\n\nChennai Chicken ($9.5) - This was also very small but very delicious and flavorful, and comes with yogurt for dipping. ($9.50)\n\nLamb Pepper Fry ($19.5) - Good tender lamb but a little salty (and now that I'm looking at the menu prices, expensive too holy cow!). Very small for the price - think one cup of curry. We got it with the lemon rice ($3) but everyone said was good but personally, I'm not a big sour fan, so I'd probably go for coconut next time.\n\nChanna Bhatura ($15) - \"BIG PUFFY THING\" - GET THIS! Fight with your friends over who gets to be the first to rip a hole and deflate the steaming bhatura. Slightly sweet, slightly crispy, and slightly chewy. You will have leftover chickpea masala so you can eat it with the rice or dosa or something later on.\n\nSpicy Mung Masala Dosa ($11) - Best bang for your buck. Really good! Basically a giant crepe folded over with mashed potatoes in the middle. It also comes with a lentil soup, which you can also eat with rice too wooot!\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa ($12) - If you come here a lot like me and get bored of the Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, you should get this one! The filling is the normal potato/onion/cashew mix you you'd expect, but with truffle oil. I love truffle oil and you can really taste it here! \n\nFennel and Spinach Dosa ($13) - This one's a little different from the other dosas. Instead of one big crepe, they divide it into a couple of smaller rolled up crepes. And it doesn't have masala, so there are no potatoes, and the filling is sauteed spinach and more vegetable-y. I personally like the other two dosas listed above better.\n\nUttapam: South Indian Moons ($14) - These weren't BAD, but they were nowhere as good as the other dishes. This was a sampler of all five uttapams and they were all pretty unimpressive, and kind of all tasted the same. Kind of like a small thick not-sweet pancake with different things on top.

Rather, it was a more multifaceted, refined interpretation of spiciness from various spices, beans, chili, and garlic.

But please inform them that Shrikhand is not just \"sweet yogurt.\"  Gogurt is sweet yogurt.  Shrikhand and gogurt are completely different things.  Therefore Shrikhand must not be sweet yogurt, right?\n\nEDIT\n .\nI see dedicated pain in the ass Anjan M. has decided to comment on my review.  \n\nHere's an idea: why don't you convene your legendary 14 south indians to find some recipes that actually celebrate the gastronomic diversity of the south?\n\nNo?\n\nYou're still going to serve up the same old pablum?\n\nAnd you're still the same condescending bore you were yesterday?\n\nOK.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-09-06"}, {"excerpts": ["We also ordered the dahi rice (rice with yogurt) and its nothing complicated to make but they had a nice touch with the onions and carrots which really rounded off the meal well.

Somebody told me about dosa but I remember the first time I walked by this place my instant reaction was - \"There is way too many white people in there, this place can't be authentic!\". Bigotted view, I know, but I still stood by it.\n\nThe only reason I finally ended up going was the fact that my folks were in town and my mother basically only eats indain cuisine. So, I took them there fully expecting to get basterdized versions of south indian dishes with hefty price tags.\n\nTo my surprise it turned out way better than I expected. The service may have been a bit slow but the masala dosa that I ordered was pretty good. The masala wasn't great but the dosa was really quite moist which I liked. The sambar was pretty good though I wasn't too impressed with the chutneys that came with the dosa (unfortunately not spicy enough for my palatte). \n\nMy mother got the onion rava dosa which was one of the better dosas that I've had anywhere really. Normally the rava has way too much pepper in it but over here it was right on. \n\nWe also ordered the dahi rice (rice with yogurt) and its nothing complicated to make but they had a nice touch with the onions and carrots which really rounded off the meal well. In addition, the whole thing didn't end up being that expensive. This place was much better than the only other south indian place I know in SF - Udupi which is just a block down on Valencia.\n\nI'll go there again... I'd still like to find that cheap and grubby south indian place in SF but this will do as a substitute.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-01-24"}], "barfi": [{"excerpts": ["For dessert, we unfortunately didn't like the pistachio barfi but thought the Madras coffee was a great end to the meal."], "author": "Christine A.", "review": "Great cocktails - the Bengali Gimlet and Steph Curry (lol) were refreshing and decently strong.\n\nChennai chicken made a great appetizer. \n\nLamb pepper fry curry and masala dosa were packed with flavors and delicious.   \n\nFor dessert, we unfortunately didn't like the pistachio barfi but thought the Madras coffee was a great end to the meal.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-11-12"}, {"excerpts": ["- Pistachio Barfi: it's like a fudge bar with pistachio shreds sprinkled on top.\n\n"], "author": "Eva O.", "review": "Must Try for SF Restaurant Week!\n\nLuckily, my friend and I were able to make reservations during SF restaurant week. We've heard nothing but great things about DOSA so we were very tempted to try it out. What better time to try it out than SF Restaurant Week?\n\nWhat We Ordered:\nSMALL PLATES (pick 3)\n- Batata Vada: It's similar to croquette and was packed with a lot of flavor and spices. \n- Chennai Chicken: it's like eating popcorn chicken strips, do add the lemon to enhance the flavoring. \n- Lemon Chile Scallops: MY FAVORITE! Normally I don't like eating scallops, but I couldn't resist! A picture is worth a 1,000 words (see my picture)\n\nDOSAS, CURRIES & MORE: (pick 3)\n- Lamb 'Keema' Dosa: everyone's top recommendation and they were not wrong. it comes with this crepe-like bread to dip the sauces\n- Mixed Mushroom & Truffle Oil Uttapam: It's like eat flat bread with mushrooms, a great pick for mushroom lovers!\n- Coconut Chicken Masala: it was a bit spicier than I imaged but that didn't stop me from using the poori to dip it. \n\nSIDE: \n- Poori: it's like a giant puffy bread that's bigger than your head and super yummy to dip with all the sauces. \n\nDESSERT: (pick 2):\n- House Made Sorbet: mango sorbet, really yummy!\n- Pistachio Barfi: it's like a fudge bar with pistachio shreds sprinkled on top.\n\nGreat experience, great food, and great company!", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-01-26"}, {"excerpts": ["We described it as kind of like a pizza pancake aha\n\nDessert:\n- Pistachio Barfi\n"], "author": "Nerissa C.", "review": "Just as everyone says, this place is pretty bomb diggity.\n\nHopefully this helps a good bunch of you who are interested but I came here for Restaurant week 2017 after reading @lucyatcal 's medium post about the Best and Worst deals of SF Restaurant week--she had Dosa at the top of the list with almost $163ish dollars worth of food for about $40. If anyone is reading this during the week of Restaurant week (Jan 18- 29) first thing I have to mention is that the menu on the site is NOT the same as what they are serving in store! Hopefully they change that... but just a heads up, I actually think it's better because it includes more options of small plates and a choice of dessert.\n\nMy roommate and I (whom I'm sure you'll see her reviews of this place too ;) (shout to to you Marcie!) decided we had to finally try this place after hearing all about it and of course, realizing it was the best RW deal! So the two of us made a reservation and came here along with my boyfriend.\n\nA couple things to note about restaurant week: as a table you pick 3 small dishes, 3 main dishes and 2 desserts and you share with the table. The waitress will portion it between however many people you have. I think the best deal is coming with 2 people but in any case, the servers are really good at making sure there is enough food so even with a big group, I'm sure it would be great :)\n\nWe decided to pick the following:\nSmall Plates:\n- Red Beet and Cumin Soup\nThis was super good! Nicely spiced with a perfect bit of sweetness, this was like a gazpacho (except warm) or like a tomato soup, except with beets. Super smooth and luxuriously rich with a ton of amazing flavor. Definitely going to try and imitate it ourselves! It seems simple but so good and perfect to warm up your soul\n\n- Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad\nThis was nice--nothing to speak lengths about but it had lentils and a nice crunch from the mung bean. It was pretty refreshing overall, nice and light but also very filling. Ours came with only two small pieces of paneer and we each had a solid couple spoonfuls to try it. \n\n- Chennai Chicken\nOMG so bombass. This was super good, moist and delicious chicken (probably the thighs) and it was covered in a crust and deep fried. It came with this yummy yogurt marinade and all three of us could not stop eating it it was so good, The perfect little appetizer and a taste for all palates :P\n\nMain Dishes:\n- Shrimp Biryani\nThis was really good, a sort of fried rice mixture with really soft rice and a bunch of spices plus a couple of mix ins and some shrimp. We got maybe 4-5 pieces of shrimp and a good helping of rice. This was a great compliment to the meal and just an overall solid option.\n\n- Lamb Keema (Dosa)\nIn case you don't know, a dosa is almost like a mixture of a crepe and like a chip--it's fried on one side so that it's crispy and the other side is a little bit doughy but overall, the dosa at Dosa is pretty thin--great as like a cripsy and flour tortilla in one or a one sided crispy injera (yea, poor description but the closest I can think of!). You'll fill it with sauces, and mixings, just as you would like a taco or crepe or like Injera (ethiopian pancake). Our dosa came with this really nice spiced lamp mixture with some potatoes and on the sides we also got this like coconut green sauce, a spicy red sauce, and a big bowl of this reddish orange curry. Overall it was delicious, especially just mixing everything together!\n\n- Organic Mushroom and Arugula Uttapam\nThis was basically like a pancake--it reminded me a lot of a vietnamese pancake or a part pancake, part omlette-y crepe. It was filled with delicious mushrooms and truffle oil and topped with fresh arugula. This also came with the chutneys and assorted dips which really complimented the dish. We described it as kind of like a pizza pancake aha\n\nDessert:\n- Pistachio Barfi\nThis was a decadant little chocolate sort of cake. So good.... layers of cashew milk fudge with pistachios, ganache and all sorts of goodies layered into a perfect little cake. Its a small serving but so rich that we barely finished it given the small piece we recieved!\n\n- Mango Sorbet\nThe best kind of sorbet period. You really can't go wrong with this, it's the besttttt\n\nAnd that's that! At $42 a person and then additional tax and tip, it was a TON of food and RW was a great way to taste so much of their menu without breaking the bank, since this place is normally pretty high end. The food is really outstanding though and I know I would definitely be back and recommend this to friends. We were all STUFFED and I'm so happy I took advantage of this deal.
