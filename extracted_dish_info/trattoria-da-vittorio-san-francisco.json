It was crispy and tender, but was not seasoned, so it was bland.  \n\nI ordered orange juice for my children, which they provided without the lids.  We had to ask another server for the lids.\n\nFor entrees, we had Pappardelle with Ragu, Osso Bucco over risotto (the risotto still had some bite - some might like it that way, but I like mine a little more tender), gnocci in a gorgonzola cream sauce (very tender), veal scaloppini and a kids pasta and tomato sauce.    There were no vegetables with any of the entrees and no sides of vegetables were offered on the menu, otherwise, I would have ordered some vegtables.  The food did come quickly, which was appreciated since we had to wait for about 30 mins for a table.\n\nHalf way through our entrees I noticed that they never brought us bread, though the tables around us were provided bread.\n\nWe ordered tiramisu, the apple tart and the cannoli for dessert.  As the evening went on, the noise level increased, so the waiter did not hear our complete dessert order.  When he provided the check, without the tiramisu and apple tart, we informed him of the error, and he apologized, but I feel he should have made some concession, as they started cleaing the table with us still there, and we had to inform other servers that we were waiting for our dessert.  \n\nThey never provided us the correct number of settings.  There were 6 of us, and when we were seated, there were only 3 settings on a table.  We had to ask for the additional 2 settings, twice.  When we ordered dessert, they only brought 4 forks - we had to ask for another 2 forks.  \n\nOverall this place is OK.  It could be good if they can (1) figure out how to control the noise level (my ears are still ringing), (2) be more consistent with the service, and (3) turn off the TV!  Is this a sports bar or a nice restaurant??!!?

Or none them have been to Italy?  Or none of them have even been to Tony's and had the Margherita pizza there, which, and I've searched long and hard for this, is the closest thing to the pizza I had in Naples.\n\nOur little group of 3 walked in around 5:15 PM and were seated immediately.  The inside was very warm and welcoming, a true neighborhood joint.  We noticed a larger group a few tables down, with about 5 children between the ages of 6 and 10.  The children were shrieking and laughing and chattering away so loudly that the adults had to raise their voices to speak to one another.  The sheer volume of that table's conversations made it impossible for us to hear each other, even though we were sitting right next to each other.  Finally I shot a glare towards that table, and one of the adults told the children that they needed to quiet down a bit.  Luckily they were almost done, so we only had to endure the noise for a bit longer.  This immediately downgraded my first impression of the restaurant, because whenever you have a LOUD group of children with adults who don't teach them to use their \"inside voices,\" you're basically nothing more than an Applebee's.  Ugh, I sound like a snob, but it's totally true.\n\nSince I'd read great reviews of the Margherita pizza, the pappardelle with wild boar ragu, and the gnocchi, we decided to order all of those, and my aunt added in the pumpkin ravioli.  We were served bread and olive oil (but no balsamic vinegar, which I found odd), and our Margherita pizza came very quickly.  Fiance also ordered the insalata mista, which he said had zero flavor or seasoning, as it was some leafy greens with olive oil and nothing else.\n\nI was so excited because our Margherita looked amazing, until I took my first bite.  There was absolutely no flavor or seasoning.  The sauce was plain, the dough/crust was plain.. I could have basically been eating a handful of flour.  Once I added a pinch of salt onto the pizza, it magically transformed.  But seriously, if you're going to hail yourself as an Italian restaurant, I shouldn't need to shake the salt over the food myself.\n\nMy gnocchi, while very tender and pillowy soft, was also completely flavorless, as was the tomato sauce.  It got me wondering if they had actually opened a can of tomato sauce, because it looked and tasted EXACTLY like a can of generic, unsalted and unseasoned tomato sauce.  The same sauce was used in the wild boar ragu, and the meat was dry and tough.\n\nWe had NO desire to have dessert after the meal; Fiance and I are both big eaters, but neither of us wanted to finish our meals.  I'm sorry, Trattoria da Vittorio, did you run out of seasoning or something last night?  Because nothing I had there made me want to return.

I love freshly made food.  \n\nNow what to order?!?  Everything on the menu sounded incredible. With it being October, there were a few pumpkin inspired dishes such as their risotto and soup. But, i wasn't feeling it.

Though I enjoyed my seafood pasta dish, it was a little too fishy for me but hey, it's what I ordered.  The Lasagna was my favorite, if ever am I craving a Lasagna, I'm heading to this place.  The meatballs that came with the spaghetti ranks up as one of my faves.  \n\n-Seafood Pasta - 4 star\n-Spaghetti with Meatball - 4 star\n-Lasagna - 5 star\n\nOh, I forgot to mention we started with the Calamari which was legitimate. Their mint dipping sauce wasn't my favorite. i preferred the other sauce but wished the regular marinara was provided.\n\nWhen I go to an Italian place with legitimate food, I always order dessert. We were torn on what to get. Of course Tiramisu is always the go-to dish but the Homemade Profiterole (cream puff filled with ice cream instead of whipped cream) looked so interesting. We asked the server about the 2 options but we decided to play it safe and get the Tiramisu.  Well...to our surprise he brought u the Profiterole for us to try (on the house) which brought a smile to all our faces. These guys are 4.5 stars on Yelp for a reason! Nice! Both desserts were excellent, I can't decide which I enjoyed more, they were very different and both will not disappoint. \n\nAt the end of our night, the bill was $100 for 3 people. The portions were super generous so we had 3 boxes of food to go. 1/2 of 2 entrees and 1/3 of the appetizer so I feel their pricing was very good. The food quality is excellent but the standout for this place is the wonderful service. \n\nNote that this is a true Italian establishment where you eat a nice and slow dinner.

I think its better to sit at the counter with my sweety, since being at a table divides us farther apart. Who agrees with me?! Being at the counter at Trattoria Da Vittorio is amazing because we could observe how the restaurant functions. This restaurant has an open aired kitchen where people at the counter could observe the kitchen staff working while the wait staff run around delivering piping hot savory meals to our tables. \n\nI ordered the Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce.The melding of the spices and sweet tomatoes in the sauce combined with the saltiness from the mollusks created an explosion of flavor in my mouth as I devoured my food. If I added Parmesan cheese to this delicate dish, it would have changed my palate and this review. Taking a sip of wine in between bites helped amplify the flavor of my food and the atmosphere (or, maybe because I may have been getting buzzed too). I didn't know what wine went well with this dish, so I asked the server to recommend one that was smooth, had a good fragrance, and full bodied; I had a Pinot Noir (Meiomi California 2011). I'm glad our server helped me pick a wine, otherwise I may have ordered one which could have destroyed the my appetite! \n\nSweety had the Pappardelle con cinghiale wild boar ragu. Amazingly, she devoured her food in a blink of an eye. Must have been that tasty?! We sampled each others dishes and both were delicious! Pappardelle pasta were like thin ribbons wrapped around my fork which skewered a piece of wild boar. Wild boar was well marinated and cooked thoroughly. It was a bit gamey tasting, but hey, it was to be expected right? \n\nThe evening winded down with dessert. We shared a Tiramisu and a Nutellino (a homemade calzone stuffed with nutella chocolate). Nutellino was really good because of the oozing magma hot nutella chocolate and the light fluffy crust of the calzone. Loved it! However, the Tiramisu was mediocre because it looked like it was hastily made. It fell apart too quickly. Could be the batch or something. Either way, it was tasty and ended up like everything else in my tummy. Seriously, I think I became a fatass in evening. BUT IT WAS ALL WORTH IT! \n\nAh, now the SERVICE. \n\nService was..\n\nwas...\n\nSERVICE WAS AWESOME! \nOur servers were quick with catering to our customerly requests (knowledge of wines, dessert menu, bill). From the kitchen, we had some interaction with the head chef and the general manager too. I sometimes have this clueless look or bored expression on my face when I'm digesting. I guess my expression attracted the owner very quickly. He was directing his chef with something right across from me in the kitchen and upon looking up, he noticed me drifting off into space. Thanks for the service Mr. D'Urzo, much appreciated!\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis is probably my 5th or 6th time coming here and I always seem to forget to review it until NOW! I highly recommend this place for a small family/friend get together or for a date. The atmosphere is very intimate since the lights in here are often dimmed to provide that cozy romantic setting. The wait staff and kitchen staff speak very fluent Italian and Spanish. You can distinguish the kitchen staff pretty well as the Hispanics are either line cooks or dish washers who wear black, while the sous chef and executive chef wear white. \n\nI think the food is top notch, fresh and very flavorful. Will come again in the future. \n\nBon App\u00e9tit!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-02-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Our Order:\nHandmade Scialatielli Pasta Pescatora  with fresh Mix Seafood in a Tomato Sauce ($19)\n", "Pappardelle Con Cinghiale Wild Boar Ragu ($17)\n", "Pinot Noir - Meiomi California 2011 ($12)\n"], "author": "Kitty K.", "review": "I was told that they handmade their pasta and since I'm such a huge pasta person, I knew I had to try a dish with pasta (and I had pizza the night before so I'd have to save their pizza for another time since they're known it as well). Just a couple doors down from Shaw's on W. Portal, parking here is fairly difficult to find. The decor is simple but elegant and the lighting is dimmed as well so it's a great place for a date night. \n\nWe were starving so we opted to sit at the bar which allowed us to get seated right away. A feature that I enjoyed at this establishment is that they have an open air kitchen so it allowed us to see the hustle and bustle while we sat and ate. In addition, we were seated right across from the pizza oven so it was nice to watch the items being cooked in it.\n\nOur Order:\nHandmade Scialatielli Pasta Pescatora  with fresh Mix Seafood in a Tomato Sauce ($19)\nPappardelle Con Cinghiale Wild Boar Ragu ($17)\nPinot Noir - Meiomi California 2011 ($12)\nNutellino: ($8) homemade Calzone stuffed with Nutella chocolate\nMama's Tiramisu ($7)\n\nWhile we're waiting they offer complimentary house bread with a side of olive oil. It was great because we were starving though our waiter never brought out the balsamic vinaigrette that I asked for. I had to ask the waitress that brought out our food to brings some. At least the food came out quickly.\n\nPappardelle Con Cinghiale is a wide ribbon pasta dish served with a ragu sauce with tender chunks of wild boar. I loved how tender the boar was and it wasn't very gamey (which would've been fine with me if it was since I grew up on game meat). The boar was probably my favorite thing of the entire dinner (besides the Nutellino).\n\nScialatielli Pasta Pescatora is a dish that reminds me of a cioppino over thick spaghetti-like noodles. I'm always weary about shellfish and how well they are cleaned but they weren't sandy or gritty here (just teeny tiny).\n\nI took a sip of the Pinot Noir and it complimented the meal well (though I'm not much of a wine drinker). It was smooth and not too dry.\n\nI love Tiramisu and was only going to order that until my friend pointed out the Nutellino. Nutella is another sweet that is a weakness of mine. Though they describe it as a calzone, it was more like a thick bread-stick with Nutella in it served on a wooden plank along side whipped cream that was dusted with cocoa powder. It had just come out of the oven as the Nutella was in a glorious melty state and oozed out of the bread as we tore it apart. Even though I love tiramisu, between the two desserts I enjoyed the Nutellino more. The tiramisu was moist but I prefer the ones where it has a bit of rum in it.\n\nNote: Though it's a great place for a date night, they do have a children's menu if you have to bring the little ones along.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-02-26"}], "handmade porcini mushroom ravioli": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli, the Eggplant Parmigiana, the Uovo pizza, and the Nutellino. \n\n", "The Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli was our favorite dish of the night.

The light, fluffy crust was stuffed with rich and gooey Nutella. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't stop eating because it was so good. Our waiter also gave us a complementary slice of tiramisu. The tiramisu tasted pretty traditional to me, and I liked that it wasn't too sweet.\n\nWe came here on a Saturday around 8 pm.

I hadn't been here since it was the Cafe For All Seasons and didn't even notice when they closed or when this place opened so it's been a while. Firstly we wanted to make a reservation for around noon on Sunday but upon calling, found out that they do not take reservations, so we had to plan on getting here early before they opened to insure a table for 7, so we got there at quarter to 11 to get first dibs on a table. \n\nThey served us bread and we ordered the Calamari as an appetizer. The Calamari tasted fresh but average in taste. The bread they served was very dry and served with a cup of olive oil.  \n\nI had the Fiocchetti  (Homemade Pasta stuffed with 3 Italian cheeses, pear in gorgonzola cream sauce. it was good but didn't really wow me though.

I also thought my entree to be a little better but wasn't expecting it to be great though. My mom was the only one who loved her omelette and of course my six year old niece had very high praise for her personal pizza. \n\nWe ordered two tiramisu's and one creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake, both very good. The bill for 6 adults and one child was just under $160 before gratuity; with no wine or beer ordered. A few years ago I would have considered that overpriced for quality of food, but everything in San Francisco is so expensive these days, nothing surprises me anymore. \n\nThe restaurant is nice with good atmosphere and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Our waiter; didn't catch his name was a charming and friendly young Italian guy from Salerno. He told us a little about himself and offered to take photos with my brother's phone. \n\nAll in all I thought it was pretty good; probably because I went there with no expectations and it was better than half of the places where we frequently dine. My sister in law was a bit let down because she went on the high reviews on Yelp and then hyped it up to other members of my family who then also expected it to be amazing. It's like being hyped up for a movie that people are raving about and when you see it, it's always a letdown because it didn't quite meet your expectations. I would have added a fourth star if they took reservations. \n\nOn an off note, take my advise and never go out to an Italian restaurant with someone who's \"been to Italy\" You know the type! the pretentious showoff wannabe type who go on and on about their superior knowledge of Italian cuisine who just won't shut up! ..

I also liked that they had pieces of fried artichoke. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall this restaurant had a perfect trifecta of exemplary service, perfect ambiance and delicious food. To top it off, it was my cousins birthday so they had a wonderful surprise for her after our dinner.

We had no place in mind for dinner so we decided to walk around the area and see what calls out to us...well, that and my handy yelp app which helped to suade us. The 4.5 average star rating at Trattoria Da Vittorio got my curiosity going so we walked by and loved the ambiance and we all agreed immediately if the wait wasn't long, it was meant to be.\n\nWe were there last night around 8:30pm (Thursday) and got seated at the bar within 10 minutes The wait would have been much longer for a tabletop but we were starving.  The first thing that stood out was that all the workers were Italian. BIG PLUS.  At first the smell of the restaurant bothered me and my friend said it was the yeast for the bread. 2nd BIG PLUS.  I love freshly made food.  \n\nNow what to order?!?  Everything on the menu sounded incredible. With it being October, there were a few pumpkin inspired dishes such as their risotto and soup. But, i wasn't feeling it. I scrolled through the pictures on yelp and their homemade pasta looked good, I decided on the seafood pasta dish (Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora  with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce  for $19)                My friends had the Lasagna and the Spaghetti with Meatball.  Though I enjoyed my seafood pasta dish, it was a little too fishy for me but hey, it's what I ordered.  The Lasagna was my favorite, if ever am I craving a Lasagna, I'm heading to this place.  The meatballs that came with the spaghetti ranks up as one of my faves.  \n\n-Seafood Pasta - 4 star\n-Spaghetti with Meatball - 4 star\n-Lasagna - 5 star\n\nOh, I forgot to mention we started with the Calamari which was legitimate. Their mint dipping sauce wasn't my favorite. i preferred the other sauce but wished the regular marinara was provided.\n\nWhen I go to an Italian place with legitimate food, I always order dessert. We were torn on what to get. Of course Tiramisu is always the go-to dish but the Homemade Profiterole (cream puff filled with ice cream instead of whipped cream) looked so interesting. We asked the server about the 2 options but we decided to play it safe and get the Tiramisu.  Well...to our surprise he brought u the Profiterole for us to try (on the house) which brought a smile to all our faces. These guys are 4.5 stars on Yelp for a reason! Nice! Both desserts were excellent, I can't decide which I enjoyed more, they were very different and both will not disappoint. \n\nAt the end of our night, the bill was $100 for 3 people. The portions were super generous so we had 3 boxes of food to go. 1/2 of 2 entrees and 1/3 of the appetizer so I feel their pricing was very good. The food quality is excellent but the standout for this place is the wonderful service. \n\nNote that this is a true Italian establishment where you eat a nice and slow dinner.

Generally, the parking in this area sucks because \n\n1. Its West Portal.\n2. Everyone eats out or is watching a movie.\n3. Its Sunday. \n\nLuckily, we found someone leaving their parking spot, so we nabbed it. When we came into the restaurant, it was already bustling with people eating dinner and having a good time. We decided it would be best to sit at the counter instead of waiting an hour for a table. SCORE! \n\nWe were seated within the first five minutes next to a column. I think its better to sit at the counter with my sweety, since being at a table divides us farther apart. Who agrees with me?! Being at the counter at Trattoria Da Vittorio is amazing because we could observe how the restaurant functions. This restaurant has an open aired kitchen where people at the counter could observe the kitchen staff working while the wait staff run around delivering piping hot savory meals to our tables. \n\nI ordered the Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce.The melding of the spices and sweet tomatoes in the sauce combined with the saltiness from the mollusks created an explosion of flavor in my mouth as I devoured my food. If I added Parmesan cheese to this delicate dish, it would have changed my palate and this review. Taking a sip of wine in between bites helped amplify the flavor of my food and the atmosphere (or, maybe because I may have been getting buzzed too). I didn't know what wine went well with this dish, so I asked the server to recommend one that was smooth, had a good fragrance, and full bodied; I had a Pinot Noir (Meiomi California 2011). I'm glad our server helped me pick a wine, otherwise I may have ordered one which could have destroyed the my appetite! \n\nSweety had the Pappardelle con cinghiale wild boar ragu. Amazingly, she devoured her food in a blink of an eye. Must have been that tasty?! We sampled each others dishes and both were delicious! Pappardelle pasta were like thin ribbons wrapped around my fork which skewered a piece of wild boar. Wild boar was well marinated and cooked thoroughly. It was a bit gamey tasting, but hey, it was to be expected right? \n\nThe evening winded down with dessert. We shared a Tiramisu and a Nutellino (a homemade calzone stuffed with nutella chocolate). Nutellino was really good because of the oozing magma hot nutella chocolate and the light fluffy crust of the calzone. Loved it! However, the Tiramisu was mediocre because it looked like it was hastily made. It fell apart too quickly. Could be the batch or something. Either way, it was tasty and ended up like everything else in my tummy. Seriously, I think I became a fatass in evening. BUT IT WAS ALL WORTH IT! \n\nAh, now the SERVICE. \n\nService was..\n\nwas...\n\nSERVICE WAS AWESOME! \nOur servers were quick with catering to our customerly requests (knowledge of wines, dessert menu, bill). From the kitchen, we had some interaction with the head chef and the general manager too. I sometimes have this clueless look or bored expression on my face when I'm digesting. I guess my expression attracted the owner very quickly. He was directing his chef with something right across from me in the kitchen and upon looking up, he noticed me drifting off into space. Thanks for the service Mr. D'Urzo, much appreciated!\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis is probably my 5th or 6th time coming here and I always seem to forget to review it until NOW! I highly recommend this place for a small family/friend get together or for a date. The atmosphere is very intimate since the lights in here are often dimmed to provide that cozy romantic setting. The wait staff and kitchen staff speak very fluent Italian and Spanish. You can distinguish the kitchen staff pretty well as the Hispanics are either line cooks or dish washers who wear black, while the sous chef and executive chef wear white. \n\nI think the food is top notch, fresh and very flavorful.

I've seen businesses come and go, and Trattoria da Vittorio has some lasting power. \n\nWhen my girlfriend and I walked in we were immediately greeted by multiple members of the wait staff and seated almost right away. Upon sitting we were simultaneously brought waters and a small serving of bread and olive oil to begin the evening.\n\nAfter a few introductions from the wait staff, we placed our order of bruschetta topped with Burrata cheese and prosciutto. She ordered the San Daniele pizza and I ordered the pesto gnocchi with a special request of the usually lunchtime only pesto sauce. \n\nWithin a few minutes the bruschetta had arrived. Before leaving the waitress took our order of a bottle of 2010 Sangiovese. For wine enthusiasts, this place has about the most thorough wine menu you will find besides the small import wine bars in West Portal. \n\nOur waitress promptly returned with a very customary opening of red wine, allowing me to smell and taste the bottle before offering it to the table. Before she could leave, the bruschetta followed. Now I've had your typical diced tomato and olive oil bruschetta, but this took the creativity trophy. Not only was the cheese sweet and complimentary, but the prosciutto was aged to perfection, providing an excellent texture to top off the small bite.\n\nSoon our entrees came. The San Daniele pizza was crisp, light, and very well balanced. Not too heavy on any one of the ingredients, while keeping the marinara sauce just light enough to provide a platform for the rest of the toppings to shine. My pesto gnocchi came out piping hot and literally soft enough to melt in your mouth. While the portion was a bit on the small side, the pesto itself was good enough to warrant asking for a to-go box just for the sauce. \n\nAfter dinner and wine was said and done, we turned our attention to the dessert menu. As a Sicilian myself, I had to try the cannoli. After a full meal, I also ordered a cappuccino, just to see how the wait staff's barista skills were. We were surprised to find that as our cannoli came out, we were also brought out a tiramisu order on the house! Within minutes, my foamy, full cappucino came out and satisfied everything I had looked for after a full meal. Not only that, but the cannoli wasn't overcooked, and wasn't overly sweet as well. However, the tiramisu was really what stole the spotlight at the end of the meal. I can't recommend you try this enough at Trattoria. \n\nOverall, the staff was charming and hospitable (in particular the owner Vittorio, who takes his time to speak with each and every table), the food felt home-made and traditionally prepared, and the environment just what West Portal was lacking. \n\n5 stars!

She ordered the San Daniele pizza and I ordered the pesto gnocchi with a special request of the usually lunchtime only pesto sauce. \n\nWithin a few minutes the bruschetta had arrived. Before leaving the waitress took our order of a bottle of 2010 Sangiovese. For wine enthusiasts, this place has about the most thorough wine menu you will find besides the small import wine bars in West Portal. \n\nOur waitress promptly returned with a very customary opening of red wine, allowing me to smell and taste the bottle before offering it to the table. Before she could leave, the bruschetta followed. Now I've had your typical diced tomato and olive oil bruschetta, but this took the creativity trophy. Not only was the cheese sweet and complimentary, but the prosciutto was aged to perfection, providing an excellent texture to top off the small bite.\n\nSoon our entrees came. The San Daniele pizza was crisp, light, and very well balanced. Not too heavy on any one of the ingredients, while keeping the marinara sauce just light enough to provide a platform for the rest of the toppings to shine.

As a Sicilian myself, I had to try the cannoli. After a full meal, I also ordered a cappuccino, just to see how the wait staff's barista skills were. We were surprised to find that as our cannoli came out, we were also brought out a tiramisu order on the house! Within minutes, my foamy, full cappucino came out and satisfied everything I had looked for after a full meal. Not only that, but the cannoli wasn't overcooked, and wasn't overly sweet as well. However, the tiramisu was really what stole the spotlight at the end of the meal. I can't recommend you try this enough at Trattoria. \n\nOverall, the staff was charming and hospitable (in particular the owner Vittorio, who takes his time to speak with each and every table), the food felt home-made and traditionally prepared, and the environment just what West Portal was lacking. \n\n5 stars!

We had no place in mind for dinner so we decided to walk around the area and see what calls out to us...well, that and my handy yelp app which helped to suade us. The 4.5 average star rating at Trattoria Da Vittorio got my curiosity going so we walked by and loved the ambiance and we all agreed immediately if the wait wasn't long, it was meant to be.\n\nWe were there last night around 8:30pm (Thursday) and got seated at the bar within 10 minutes The wait would have been much longer for a tabletop but we were starving.  The first thing that stood out was that all the workers were Italian. BIG PLUS.  At first the smell of the restaurant bothered me and my friend said it was the yeast for the bread. 2nd BIG PLUS.  I love freshly made food.  \n\nNow what to order?!?  Everything on the menu sounded incredible. With it being October, there were a few pumpkin inspired dishes such as their risotto and soup. But, i wasn't feeling it. I scrolled through the pictures on yelp and their homemade pasta looked good, I decided on the seafood pasta dish (Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora  with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce  for $19)                My friends had the Lasagna and the Spaghetti with Meatball.  Though I enjoyed my seafood pasta dish, it was a little too fishy for me but hey, it's what I ordered.  The Lasagna was my favorite, if ever am I craving a Lasagna, I'm heading to this place.  The meatballs that came with the spaghetti ranks up as one of my faves.  \n\n-Seafood Pasta - 4 star\n-Spaghetti with Meatball - 4 star\n-Lasagna - 5 star\n\nOh, I forgot to mention we started with the Calamari which was legitimate. Their mint dipping sauce wasn't my favorite. i preferred the other sauce but wished the regular marinara was provided.\n\nWhen I go to an Italian place with legitimate food, I always order dessert. We were torn on what to get. Of course Tiramisu is always the go-to dish but the Homemade Profiterole (cream puff filled with ice cream instead of whipped cream) looked so interesting. We asked the server about the 2 options but we decided to play it safe and get the Tiramisu.  Well...to our surprise he brought u the Profiterole for us to try (on the house) which brought a smile to all our faces. These guys are 4.5 stars on Yelp for a reason! Nice! Both desserts were excellent, I can't decide which I enjoyed more, they were very different and both will not disappoint. \n\nAt the end of our night, the bill was $100 for 3 people. The portions were super generous so we had 3 boxes of food to go. 1/2 of 2 entrees and 1/3 of the appetizer so I feel their pricing was very good. The food quality is excellent but the standout for this place is the wonderful service. \n\nNote that this is a true Italian establishment where you eat a nice and slow dinner. So service may seen slow but in actuality, this is how it is meant to be. This is not a place to rush a meal, rather this is a great place to catch up with friends and spend a good few hours mingling and enjoying great Italian cuisine/wine.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-10-31"}], "nutellino": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered the Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli, the Eggplant Parmigiana, the Uovo pizza, and the Nutellino. \n\n", "The Handmade Porcini Mushroom Ravioli was our favorite dish of the night.

The crust was pillowy and airy, but the flavors didn't stand out and the runny egg kept falling off when we tried to eat the pizza. :/ It's probably best not to tamper with the original recipe.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Nutellino, which is a homemade calzone stuffed with Nutella chocolate. The light, fluffy crust was stuffed with rich and gooey Nutella. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't stop eating because it was so good. Our waiter also gave us a complementary slice of tiramisu. The tiramisu tasted pretty traditional to me, and I liked that it wasn't too sweet.\n\nWe came here on a Saturday around 8 pm. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away. We found a metered spot pretty easily (free because it was late). The ambiance is cozy and lively, and the service is amazing. Our server even asked us for our names at the end of the meal. I wish the portion size of the Mushroom Ravioli and the Eggplant Parmigiana were a bit larger, especially since both were so delicious, but the huge Uovo pizza made up for it. Adding dessert on top of that, we all left stuffed.

Generally, the parking in this area sucks because \n\n1. Its West Portal.\n2. Everyone eats out or is watching a movie.\n3. Its Sunday. \n\nLuckily, we found someone leaving their parking spot, so we nabbed it. When we came into the restaurant, it was already bustling with people eating dinner and having a good time. We decided it would be best to sit at the counter instead of waiting an hour for a table. SCORE! \n\nWe were seated within the first five minutes next to a column. I think its better to sit at the counter with my sweety, since being at a table divides us farther apart. Who agrees with me?! Being at the counter at Trattoria Da Vittorio is amazing because we could observe how the restaurant functions. This restaurant has an open aired kitchen where people at the counter could observe the kitchen staff working while the wait staff run around delivering piping hot savory meals to our tables. \n\nI ordered the Handmade Scialatielli pasta Pescatora with fresh mix seafood in a tomato sauce.The melding of the spices and sweet tomatoes in the sauce combined with the saltiness from the mollusks created an explosion of flavor in my mouth as I devoured my food. If I added Parmesan cheese to this delicate dish, it would have changed my palate and this review. Taking a sip of wine in between bites helped amplify the flavor of my food and the atmosphere (or, maybe because I may have been getting buzzed too). I didn't know what wine went well with this dish, so I asked the server to recommend one that was smooth, had a good fragrance, and full bodied; I had a Pinot Noir (Meiomi California 2011). I'm glad our server helped me pick a wine, otherwise I may have ordered one which could have destroyed the my appetite! \n\nSweety had the Pappardelle con cinghiale wild boar ragu. Amazingly, she devoured her food in a blink of an eye. Must have been that tasty?! We sampled each others dishes and both were delicious! Pappardelle pasta were like thin ribbons wrapped around my fork which skewered a piece of wild boar. Wild boar was well marinated and cooked thoroughly. It was a bit gamey tasting, but hey, it was to be expected right? \n\nThe evening winded down with dessert. We shared a Tiramisu and a Nutellino (a homemade calzone stuffed with nutella chocolate). Nutellino was really good because of the oozing magma hot nutella chocolate and the light fluffy crust of the calzone. Loved it! However, the Tiramisu was mediocre because it looked like it was hastily made. It fell apart too quickly. Could be the batch or something. Either way, it was tasty and ended up like everything else in my tummy. Seriously, I think I became a fatass in evening. BUT IT WAS ALL WORTH IT! \n\nAh, now the SERVICE. \n\nService was..\n\nwas...\n\nSERVICE WAS AWESOME! \nOur servers were quick with catering to our customerly requests (knowledge of wines, dessert menu, bill). From the kitchen, we had some interaction with the head chef and the general manager too. I sometimes have this clueless look or bored expression on my face when I'm digesting. I guess my expression attracted the owner very quickly. He was directing his chef with something right across from me in the kitchen and upon looking up, he noticed me drifting off into space. Thanks for the service Mr. D'Urzo, much appreciated!\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis is probably my 5th or 6th time coming here and I always seem to forget to review it until NOW! I highly recommend this place for a small family/friend get together or for a date. The atmosphere is very intimate since the lights in here are often dimmed to provide that cozy romantic setting. The wait staff and kitchen staff speak very fluent Italian and Spanish. You can distinguish the kitchen staff pretty well as the Hispanics are either line cooks or dish washers who wear black, while the sous chef and executive chef wear white. \n\nI think the food is top notch, fresh and very flavorful.

Just a couple doors down from Shaw's on W. Portal, parking here is fairly difficult to find. The decor is simple but elegant and the lighting is dimmed as well so it's a great place for a date night. \n\nWe were starving so we opted to sit at the bar which allowed us to get seated right away. A feature that I enjoyed at this establishment is that they have an open air kitchen so it allowed us to see the hustle and bustle while we sat and ate.

It was great because we were starving though our waiter never brought out the balsamic vinaigrette that I asked for. I had to ask the waitress that brought out our food to brings some. At least the food came out quickly.\n\nPappardelle Con Cinghiale is a wide ribbon pasta dish served with a ragu sauce with tender chunks of wild boar. I loved how tender the boar was and it wasn't very gamey (which would've been fine with me if it was since I grew up on game meat). The boar was probably my favorite thing of the entire dinner (besides the Nutellino).\n\nScialatielli Pasta Pescatora is a dish that reminds me of a cioppino over thick spaghetti-like noodles. I'm always weary about shellfish and how well they are cleaned but they weren't sandy or gritty here (just teeny tiny).\n\nI took a sip of the Pinot Noir and it complimented the meal well (though I'm not much of a wine drinker). It was smooth and not too dry.\n\nI love Tiramisu and was only going to order that until my friend pointed out the Nutellino. Nutella is another sweet that is a weakness of mine. Though they describe it as a calzone, it was more like a thick bread-stick with Nutella in it served on a wooden plank along side whipped cream that was dusted with cocoa powder.
