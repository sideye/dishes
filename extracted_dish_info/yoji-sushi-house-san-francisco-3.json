With the exception of Chouchou and Kathy's, which has a lot of regulars, it has always been tough for the third restaurant in this five store shopping center. There was a Mexican restaurant that seemed promising but I did not have a chance to try it before Sushi Shoh took its place. \n\nOne exciting thing about Sushi Shoh is that they offer yakitori, which is lacking in the bay area, even if you count the San Jose region. So I ordered the Yakitori Moriwase (combo) and my husband ordered the Chirashi dinner. The yakitori was six skewers chef's choice and they gave us: Butaniku Yaki, Gyu Hire Yaki, shishito, shitake, Namajake Sumiyaki, and Tebasaki. They were all good but not great in comparison to a specialized yakitori restaurant. It was mentioned on the menu that they use real Japanese charcoal, which is great, because it imparts a different flavor than regular American charcoal. \n\nWe knew right away when we walked in that this was a Chinese owned and operated Japanese restaurant and that was fine by us. We eat a lot of great Japanese food, from Japanese restaurants that are owned and operated by Japanese, to others that are Japanese owned but have a lot of Chinese cooks/staff, and this would fall into the third category, Japanese restaurants owned and operated by Chinese folk.

This was not the sushi I knew and loved, but something far more inferior. So, because inquiring minds must know, I called the restaurant to ask what gives - Did someone call in sick? Is there a new apprentice? Is it take your kid to work day? Unfortunately, I was informed, it was something far worse - It turns out the chef has been replaced, permanently.

On a sushi rating, its just ok, maybe a 5 out of 10. However, for their other dishes, I'd rate it a 9. Of course we ordered some sushi since you'd think they have great sushi since its in their name. Its good that we ordered a variety including sushi. I'll elaborate.\n\nFor starters we had some yakitori appetizers including the gyutan (skewered beef tongue) and the hotate bacon maki (scallops with bacon wrapped around it). The gyutan was one of the best I've had here in the city, while the hotate wasn't bad too. Not many places do gyutan so this is worth it if you are into that. We also got the ankimo appetizer, but it could be a bit fresher.\n\nOur main meal planned to be sushi so we ordered the staple to judge by - maguro and hamachi, plus some others that sounded interesting like fresh hotate, walu and shime saba. All were just ok, not mind blowing like I had hoped. After that tasting, we didn't expand to more of the menu.\n\nInstead, we had the dinner combos - tempura udon and a tonkatsu dinner. Now talk about a deal! The tempura was loaded with 2 shrimp and a myriad of veggies. This was like a double load at other restaurants. Plus, the tempura coating was perfect, not too heavy. Double thumbs up! My tonkatsu dinner was just as loaded. instead of just a single pork cutlet, there were 2! Definitely worth the price. From these 2 items alone, we would ultimately be back for more.\n\nParking can be a walk, but way easier than your Richmond/Sunset restaurant parking situation.\n\nTo wrap up, If you want some great Japanese food at reasonable prices, go to Sushi Shoh.

Gyu Kire Yaki - My favorite item of the item -- angus beef skewers. The meat is not tough and cooked just enough that you can tear the beef off with ease. I wish there were more than two pieces.\n\n3. Hamachi Kama - Delicious roasted yellow tail fish. I didn't use the lemon or sauce they provided. Didn't feel it was necessary. The meat next to the bone and fins are the best parts, of course. \n\nIn addition to these tapa items, we had the following:\n\n1. Chicken Teriyaki - This is a pretty great item to have in a meal by itself. The chicken skin is crispy but not burnt. The meat is juicy and the sauce is a great complement. It also comes with salad, rice, and miso soup.\n\n2. Caterpillar Roll - Tasty but pretty typical compared to other Japanese venues.\n\n3. Sashimi Omakase (for four people) - Very fresh fish! I enjoyed the salmon and tuna the most. \n\nService is great. Waitress smiles and provides a friendly atmosphere for her guest.  \n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this place.

It's because these are two things that I generally cannot do at home.  I do not posses the skill necessary to slice sashimi.  Instead, my knife work rivals that of Jack the Ripper.  Or a bald eagle.

Not the same diet, unfortunately, but different diets with unique twists and turns that obliterate common sense.  I especially hate it when my girlfriends are on a diet and I'm on a fat.  Yes.  A fat.  Sometimes, I just eat too healthy and work out too efficiently.  Rippling abs and sculpted toosh are just part and parcel of this fine specimen.  Hench, I like to indulge in a little fried tempura every now and again.  \n\nAlright, I tend to like a little tempura with sashimi.  It's because these are two things that I generally cannot do at home.  I do not posses the skill necessary to slice sashimi.  Instead, my knife work rivals that of Jack the Ripper.  Or a bald eagle.  And I do not posses a fry-a-lator (and please stop offering to buy me one for your birthday).  \n\nOn a sunday night that was neither too cold nor warm, I met up with Val at this place.  And since one of us was on a diet, the other one felt bad about ordering tempura.  Instead I got the seafood sunomono salad and the chirashi dinner entree.  Val got the rainbow roll, miso soup and edamame.  \n\nSeafood sunomono - tart, delicious, correct cucumber usage.  This salad should be made with persian cucumbers or english cucumbers, not the fat, bloated american things that have tough, waxy peels and warts.  The seafood presented was plentiful, wide in variety and tender in texture.  It was $5.\n\nChirashi dinner - came with soup.  It had lots of fish.  I've started this stupid habit of eating before I go out for food.  I will eat an orange, a pear, a bell pepper.  And a liter of water.  Which means that when I arrived for dinner, I was not exactly hungry anymore.  The chirashi was no YuZen.  But the serving was large.  The fish was wide in variety.  There was a lot of tamago.  And the fish was sliced rather thick.  Sashimi style.  I brought it home for dinner the next day.  It was $14.  \n\nThe place did a lot more business in delivery, with many black-clad men scurrying in and out with plastic bags.

The asparagus used in the yaki asparagus was made of stringy, barely edible stems - the parts I cut off when making any asparagus dish. The kicker? My $6 cheesecake was a SLIVER...
