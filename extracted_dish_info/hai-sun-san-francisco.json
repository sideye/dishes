A million trips to GrubHub.com later, and I think I have finally found it. So here it is: Hai Sun.\n\n(Please note that I have never set foot into Hai Sun, as that would defy everything I believe about delivery service and me not leaving my sofa.)\n\nHai Sun advertises on the front of the menu that they are \"None Fat / Low Fat Chinese Cuisine.\"  When they cook, they steam rather than fry, and they avoid using oil. The vegetables taste really fresh. It's a little bit like the crappy Chinese delivery you know you already love, but healthier, tastier, quality-er, and at cheap-o delivery prices.\n\nThere's something for everyone on Hai Sun's menu. My friend always gets the Happy Family. I want to have babies with their Mango Chicken, although I recently learned that the Mu Shu there is what is truly, completely unstoppable. It's the tastiest Mu Shu I've ever had, and if the pancakes didn't fall apart so much, it would be so, so perfect. The steamed Gyoza are pitch-perfect. Sometimes the potstickers from other restaurants turn out too limp, or too brown, but Hai Sun's are just right. They are masterful! The foil-wrapped chicken appetizer must be tasted to be believed. The Crab Puffs, Hai Sun's take on rangoon, are also really delicious (although, one night, it was very much a \"miss\").\n\nOrdering from Hai Sun is fast and easy, and when you do, you should request that all your chicken dishes come with white meat--I read that once in another review, and he was right, because it'll improve the quality of your food substantially. You can also order beer, because Hai Sun is full-service and awesome.\n\nHere's what not to do: NEVER ask for something \"less spicy.\" I did that when I ordered the Hunan General Chicken, and what I ended up with was perfectly inedible. It was the worst food experience I've ever had, and to tell you the truth, I blame myself. I should never have offered direction when none was needed. Hai Sun! Forgive me!\n\nHai Sun is friendly and fast, and for me, my food always comes in thirty-five minutes or less. It comes in these really cool, sturdy, Chinese take-out boxes that are microwave-safe. I always thinking about rinsing a box out and keeping it, because they're so cute, but I guess that would be silly.\n\nIn the end, and especially if you have guests who want to eat family-style from a bunch of boxes all over your living room, Hai Sun makes tummies happy. My mom visited me and we ordered Hai Sun delivery, and she couldn't believe how delicious. There's always enough food for me to get two meals out of a single serving. Mmm!

That was, until I got a good chomp of half of a raw ginger root in the garlic chicken. Now don't get me wrong - ginger in moderation is fine, but it literally made my nose hurt and my tongue go up in flames. Even after I spat it out my eyes were watering. Also- it looked like they chopped the onion into 4ths and then threw it in there. The green onions were over 4 inches long. It was like they were either too lazy to chop up the vegetables or they wanted to be perceived as healthier just because all the vegetables were basically unchopped and uncooked.\n\nThe double mushroom chicken had almost whole water chestnuts in it (which if you like those then all the power too you) but I was having to cut them up for myself. Its like they dipped all the ingredients in sauce and then expected you to chop it yourself.\n\nThe BBQ Pork Chow Mein had a funny taste to it as well. :/\n\nI seriously never write reviews, but this stuff was so effed up I had to.
