Most of our orders came very quickly--I got mine within two minutes of ordering! However, one person ordered the special (the salmon balls) and waited roughly fifteen minutes, so YMMV.

However, I have to echo the other review, which mentioned that the truffle fondue sauce wasn't very cheesy--I also could hardly taste it.\n\nNext time I'll try the (vegan) eggplant and mushroom meatballs that my coworker got--they looked and smelled delicious!

Came on the late end of lunch rush (~1pm) and there was no line, a few people waiting for orders.\n\nI ordered the turkey meatballs with spicy meat sauce and risotto. The serving was actually bigger than I expected it to be - maybe the risotto added extra weight, but overall the amount of meat they give you is pretty satisfying. I thought the sauce was great - I'm a glutton for spicy food and this had a nice kick to it. The risotto was good as well, probably a nice compliment to any kind of meat you get. The turkey meatball itself was a little dense... it's probably an over-mixing issue combined with the fact there aren't any breadcrumbs in here (from what I can tell). That being said, the flavor was still good.\n\nI probably will come again when I'm craving something hearty, maybe try the traditional balls. If salad places can charge $14 for lunch downtown, the price for this amount of meat seems fair.
