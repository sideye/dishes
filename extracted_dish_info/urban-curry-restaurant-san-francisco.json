There's no better choice than going to an Indian restaurant. I found Urban Curry from Yelp, where I go if I want to try something different. Going down the list I could see mostly 4-5 stars and hey, how could you go wrong? So Urban Curry it is.\n\nWe were standing at the door at 5PM, waiting for it to open. Walked in, impressed right away. It's clean, very clean. I work in a clinic. Cleanliness and hygiene is my main thing. Since we were the only patrons there, we got all the attention. The staff was warm and courteous. Right off the bat, complimentary Chai tea. Nice. Very nice. \n\nKaren had the eggplant. She couldn't stop praising the taste.\n\nI ordered: \nFish Pakora for appetizer. The batter was just right, not doughy at all and the fish was fresh and tender.\n\nLamb Karahi. Now this one was an adventure. Why? Because I was so ecstatic about the place and food, I totally forgot to ask them to make it mild. When the dish came, I looked at it, and the waiter, thinking \"I'm fried!\" He told me to try and see if it's too spicy. I did. It was tasty, and painfully HOT! I told him I would work around it. During the entire dinner, he was so concerned that he came over a few times to make sure I was OK. I was NOT OK, but to tell you, NO REGRETS! I was drowning the meat in yogurt to neutralize the spice. I wanted to eat it. It was so damn good.\n\nThe Naan was to die for. It was fluffy on top, and crispy at the bottom. I brought some naan home but totally forgot about it for a few days. Pulled it from the fridge, stuck it in the toaster oven and it was just as good as new.\n\nI had tears running the entire time but it's all worth it. I'm definitely coming back and bringing my friends too. The food is delicious and the price is right, and not forgetting the 15% off if you mention Yelp. As long as I write a reminder on my hand to order everything mild, I'm good to go!", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-01-15"}, {"excerpts": ["Lamb Karahi\n- "], "author": "Eric O.", "review": "I was reluctant to try this place, until I saw the Yelp reviews.  I've since been there several times and have yet to be disappointed.  First, of all, the place is clean and spacious.  The service is always friendly and attentive and the food is very worth-while.  So far, I've tried and can recommend the following:\n\n- Chicken Tikka-Masala\n- Lamb Karahi\n- Lamb Boti\n- Garlic Naan\n\nIf you can't tolerate spice in your food, it's best to make that known.  On some dishes, you'll be asked to specify the level of spiciness.  With Indian owners and Mexican line chefs, \"medium\" is pretty spicy.\n\nLast time I was in, they offered a 15% discount if you mentioned Yelp.  I don't know if this discount is still available.  However, even undiscounted, the food is very reasonable.\n\nThe only reason that this place doesn't get 5 stars is the location.  The place is located in the heart of the Broadway/Kearny/Columbus triangle, so if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll have to wade through all the bridge-and-tunnel riff-raff that invariably collects there.  I've limited my visits to weeknights for just that reason.\n\nGood, cheap food and friendly service will keep me coming back.
