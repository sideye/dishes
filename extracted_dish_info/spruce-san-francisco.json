There were 4 tables and a fireplace. So nice, it felt like being in someone's fancy living room! We started off with a cocktail: La Fresa Fresca (Olmeca altos blanco, strawberry, basil, lemon, lime, black pepper) which was fruity and well blended ($15). In case you haven't heard, their wine list is extensive. I told my lil bro that I was glad his new GF wasn't such a lush and that he didn't order the $1600 bottle of wine. ;)\n\nWhile we waited for our appetizers, the bread guy came around. All of the bread choices were super fresh and delicious. There was a cranberry bread, a wheat bread, and a French bread roll, served with good butter and sea salt.\n\nWe ate family style, which I highly recommend. It was strange at first (we were dressed to the nines), however, the benefits were quickly apparent! We were able to sample a wide variety of courses. Our helpful waiter, Rahman, suggested dishes that were great for sharing & had them brought out in sets of 2, so we had room on the table.\n\nThe charcuterie selection ($23) is highly recommended.

Flavor was good, but texture left much to be desired.\n\nOf the main dishes, the best one was probably the Crispy Duck Confit ($33). A bit of a misnomer, since the skin wasn't very crispy. I asked the waiter about it. He said there are some crispy parts, but it's not supposed to be overtly crunchy. Flavor was awesome though! The Housemade Spaghetti ($28) with Manila Clams, Spanish Chorizo, and sweet corn was a hit. Bro's GF said it was \"total comfort food\". You couldn't taste the clams that well, but the spicy, savory, sweet combo was awesome. Lil bro saw all the good reviews for the Foie Gras Burger ($40), so he had to order it. It was okay, but not a must-order, in my opinion. Quite greasy, in fact, it left a greasy puddle on the plate. Steak-cut fries were crisp and delicious. The steak bavette ($55) with smoked potatoes, heirloom carrots, pickled mushrooms was good, but not distinctive. Our waiter was correct that it's better cooked medium. The rarer pieces were very chewy, but the more cooked pieces were tender.\n\nLil bro got a special dessert, a mini cake slice with fruit & whipped cream, since it was his celebration. It was classy and beautiful. We split an order of beignets ($12) which were hot and fluffy. It came with a side of creme anglais and fruit preserves. A must-order, IMO. There were no bites before our meal, but we had some sweet treats afterward. The peanut butter squares with chocolate and sea salt - so simple, but effective, like a fancy peanut butter cup. Fruit petit fours and marshmallows followed that. Can't remember exactly, but I think they were cranberry.\n\nOverall, a super nice place to celebrate a special occasion. The side room wasn't as loud as the main room. We were quite pleased and it was not too expensive, considering the quality and quantity of the food. Service was fantastic.

We had wanted to try Spruce for a while and knew they had a large bar area. So off we went on foot for the few blocks separating our place and this culinary mecca, only to have our hopes crushed when we were faced with a jam packed bar and a few people on their \"bar wait list\" (gotta give them props though, at least you can wait in a civilized manner for your turn to get a barstool instead of having to gawk around and pry on paying patrons like vultures in order to secure a spot). I already had my phone in hand and searched the Yelp app for close-by alternatives when on of the hostesses approached us to let us know that they had a last minute dinner cancellation and we could have a table if we were interested. Yes of course we were interested!\n\nWe started the whole dining experience with a round of cocktails. Smoke & Fire (Akashi Whisky, Smoked Tea Liquor, Drambuie, Birds-Eye Chili, Lemon, Vanilla-Honey) for the gent and the Linnaeus Theory (Bacchus Winter Gin, Yellow Chartreuse, Botanical Vodka, Mint Tea, Grapefruit Bitters) for myself. Both were presented beautifully and tasted equally as good.\n\nOverwhelmed by the amazing menu options, we finally settled on the following:\n\nCharcuterie Selection ($23) - the best meat plate I have ever had, hands down! P\u00e2t\u00e9s, rillettes, dry cured thinly sliced meats from various animals and the most amazing garlic infused toasted bread slices were presented to us on a massive platter. This will be our go-to appetizer to share when we do snag two of those barstools during a future visit. \n\nCharred Spanish Octopus ($23) - .heirloom beans, romesco, and hazelnut. The octopus was tender with a perfect grill char to it and the accompanying ingredients worked flawlessly together for a great dish. \n\nPancione Ravioli ($19) - fava leaf, pistachio gremolata, ricotta whey. Even though this was the least memorable dish of the evening, the pasta was toothsome and the filling delicious. Everything else we ate that night was simply a good notch better. \n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras ($28) - boudin noir, onion brioche, apple butter. The sweet brioche bread worked really well with the richness of the liver and apple has always been my favorite fruit to pair with foie gras, so needless to say this was a winner of a dish.\n\nWe had different wines with each dish and the by the glass selection that Spruce has is top notch. The Willakenzie Estate Pinot ($17) and the Ch\u00e2teau Ro\u00fbmieu-Lacoste Sauternes ($16) were my two favorite wines we drank that evening. \n\nService was impeccable throughout our dinner and I loved that they took our coats at the beginning and had them ready for us when we got up to the front desk upon leaving.

I hadn't heard much about Spruce, with the exception of hearing how amazing their burger was.  The menu seemed pretty standard, but not having known anyone that had been there before, I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nWe brought in two bottles of wine for dinner, and were shown to the back of the restaurant in one of their rooms that seemed to be reserved for larger groups.  Once we sat down, got comfortable and started to peruse the menu, we realized it had been about 20 minutes since our waiter had been back to our table.  It seemed like our waiter was a little overbooked, so we started to get a little antsy.\n\nWhen our waiter came back, we discussed our wine selection, and Greg and I decided to split the Charcuterie Plate, and we both selected the Pork Tenderloin.  Other things that were ordered at the table: Seared Scallops, the Duck Breast, Grilled Bavette Steak, and Braised Short Ribs.\n\nHere's where it gets good.  The head sommelier Chris Gaither showed up to our table, imparted some knowledge about what we had brought in, and put out some recommendations for the table and how it pairs with our food.  Both Greg and I have been to enough fancy pants places where the sommeliers can been stuffy, stuck up, or try and upsell on on a mediocre bottle of red.  Chris, however, was not one of those guys.  He was open to all of our questions, stayed around to hang out and talk about his experiences with various vintages, types, and his own personal favorites.  If you're at Spruce, definitely trust what this guy has to say.  Thanks Chris!\n\nOur Charcuterie selection showed up, and the first thing both Greg and I thought was that the plate itself was small.  The charcuterie was presented on a plate that wasn't bigger than one of our dinner plates we have here at home.  Presented on the plate was some duck pate, three various forms of prosciutto, and a duck prosciutto (my personal favorite).  I suppose the reason why I don't remember this that well was because it was mostly a forgettable dish.  It was good, but nothing special.  \n\nOn to the mains!  The Pork Tenderloin arrives and it looks absolutely beautiful. The small medallions of loin were glazed with pork jus and some veggies.  I was completely blown away with the first bite.  It was tender, juicy, and was packed with flavor in each bite.  I ate through the vegetables and the rest of the medallions before getting to the last element on the plate: CRISPY PORK BELLY. ZOMG.  I love pork belly, and if I wasn't sold on the dish already, this put me over the edge.  This was seriously so amazing. I don't how else to put it, this was so great.  Greg said that it was the best pork tenderloin dish he's ever had.  Enough said, this was worth it.  Other people loved their dishes, although I wasn't sure if anyone enjoyed their dish as much as we did.\n\nNaturally, what's a beautiful meal without a beautiful dessert?  The girls ordered cappucinos, and Greg and I split the Beignets.  It came accompanied with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise, with 6 in one order.  I love cappucinos with my dessert and was blown away with how great Spruce's cappucino was.  It went perfectly with the light, sugary, and fluffy beignets.  The chocolate and creme sauces were messy, but if you love sweets, then you'd be tempted to lick the chocolate sauce dish after licking your fingers.  Absolutely delish.\n\nAfter the long wait for the waiter at the beginning of the meal, the service at Spruce was incredible.  I've already mentioned the sommelier, and our waiter was so sweet.  We were the last ones to leave our dining room area, and through the end, our waiter was patient and very nice.\n\nWhile the Charcuterie Plate was forgettable, everything else was amazing.  I was impressed with the service, the restaurant decor (have you seen their bar? talk about super trendy!), and of course, the food.  If you're ever in Presidio Heights and want a pleasant dining experience, please look up Spruce.

Ever since the first time my girlfriend took me here (which was our 2nd date together) I have fallen in love with this establishment, its environment, service, and of course the food.\n\nThe burger, charcuterie selection, and seafood entrees are always well balanced and never disappointing.\n\nTonight, I had a dinner here celebrating Mother's Day.  Surprisingly, Spruce was not packed at all.  We started off with the amazing charcuterie selection which still to this day has the best duck liver mousse I have had.  The order only is worth it even if you just eat this.\n\nThe rest of evening was filled with a 28oz bone-in ribeye, new york strip steak with bacon hushpuppies, and one of the best duck breasts I have ever had.\n\nSo why the 4 stars and not 5?  I've dined with Spruce at least 8 times but I am afraid with the service experienced in this dinner it will be the last time I dine with them.  The waiter constantly forgot items we asked for but the real finisher was when the bill came.  Now, Spruce is always fair priced for the quality of food and service they offer - mostly maxing out at $50 per an entree.  However, our server did not make us aware that the bone-in ribeye he was heavily advertising was $138.  That's right, $138 and nobody thought twice to mention that it was nearly 3x the most expensive item on the menu.  My girlfriend had also left her credit card with the staff in advance so that there would be not battling with who pays the bill at the end of the meal - but the waiter forgot and came with the bill and placed it right in front of my girlfriend's father.  Lastly, having a 28oz steak....it leaves for a lot of leftovers.  We had them pack for us our leftovers.  We got home and realized half of our leftovers were missing.  \n\nHowever, this is how awesome Spruce is.  We reached out to the general manager (Chris Tang) and he immediately wanted to give us a call.  Within 12 hours of the meal, the charge for the steak was refunded and Chris sent us a gift card to retry the experience we had last night.  I know no establishment is perfect, but Spruce time after time does not cease to impress with its pursuit to perfection.  The management here is relentless in assuring every wrong is corrected and I cannot think of another establishment that would go through the troubles of assuring their clients have a flawless experience.  One additional small detail - Chris contacted me at 9am the next morning (on Mother's Day) and even took time out during the brunch rush to have the phone call with me; it says a lot about an individual to choose to address this issue with such urgency on what probably is one of their most busiest times. \n\nThank you Spruce for the memories in the past and for the memories that are to come.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-05-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Charcuterie Selection \nRoasted Sonoma Chicken Breast ", "And Crispy Leg Confit \nCheese Plate\n", "The Burger and Fries\n"], "author": "Julie O.", "review": "Fantastic.

With a caliber of 4 stars, I had high expectations but I was soon let down by the poor service.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I entered the restaurant was the espresso colored wooden walls and the low lighting.  Normally I would favor the contemporary dark d\u00e9cor, but the excessive darkness did not elicit a romantic feel in me.  \n\nWe were put in a cramped corner table where the servers would walk in and out to get to the dessert prep area. The table was super cramped.  Anyone who has met me knows that my 95lb frame doesn't take up a lot of space. So imagine how tight the space was when we had to push the table away so I can sit comfortably.  \n\nFurthermore, we found out the light bulb on the ceiling directly above our table was burned out.  It was so dark we couldn't even read the menu.  And you know what their solution was, 2 tea light candles and a itty-bitty key chain flashlight.  Yeah!\n\nWhat a joke!!!!  I have never been to an upscale restaurant where I needed a flashlight to view the menu.  \n\nLet me tell you I wasn't as irked at this point.  I actually tried using the itty-bitty flashlight that the waiter gave me but the darn thing was casting a shadow ring on the menu. No matter how we tilted the flashlight, I still couldn't see the menu with my 20/20 vision.  \n\nKnowing that we had trouble with the flashlight, you would think the host/hostess would move us to another table.  OH NO!!!  He gave me another key chain flashlight, only this one has Spruce written on it.  Now why would they have these mini flashlights handy in their pockets??? My thought is that we were not the first people that they've shoved to the same dark & cramped corner table.\n\nWhat really ticked me off was the fact that not a single staff, who was aware of the lighting fiasco, bothered to apologize to us.\n\nDid they think we were going to eat our dinner in darkness?  So I asked for 6 more candles to lighten up our table.  After 30 minutes of frustration, the waiter finally moved us to another table with a working light bulb.\n\nNow let's talk about the food:\n*Cheese Puff - tasty & it was on the house (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Charcuterie selection - a mouth-watering surprise (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Grilled Bavette Steak with duck fat fries - steak was well seasoned and cooked to a medium rare perfection but the fries were greasy (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Seared Dayboat Scallops - good but nothing memorable.  \n*Banana Mousse Cake with Lime Sorbet - super rich, the sorbet cut down the richness.  (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n* Preserved & Seared Foie Gras - preserved foie gras is like pate with a buttery texture (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Seared Foie Gras - the biggest disappointment.  The pineapple juice did not compliment the 2 oz of delicacy.  I've had much better Foie Gras at Gary Danko and La Folie.\n\nThe food wasn't bad but that's no excuse for poor service.  \n\nMy advice to Spruce:  get rid of your corner table. The cramped space is not fit for any normal human being to dine in.  And please provide more lighting or candles.  I'm sure people want to see what they put in their mouth.  \n\nMy suggestion to anyone who wants to dine here: Don't do it.  Take your hard earned money and spend it elsewhere.  There are plenty of other restaurants in SF that have the same caliber but will provide you with a well deserving meal.  \n\nAnd if you insisted on coming here with just the 2 of you, be warned - there's a great chance you'll be seated at the same dark cramped corner table like me.", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-01-24"}, {"excerpts": ["We sat at the bar first and had their Pinot Gris (delicious) and the charcuterie selection, which is all house made.

Only a select few are deserving of the magical fifth star.\n\nOur evening began with a cab ride from the Mark Hopkins with a super friendly taxi driver, who in fact was trained on driving in the City back on the 60's while on LSD. I kid you not!\n\nIn any case, he was awesome and got us to our destination on time and in one piece.\n\nWe arrived a little early for our 6:45 reservation, yet the hostess worked her magic and found us a nice table near the middle of the dining room. We were immediately greeted by our server David. He made sure we knew all the in's and outs and came back a few minutes to take our drink orders.\n\nMy wife started with a glass of Billecart-Salmon Brut Ros\u00e9. It's one of her favorite sparkling wines, so to find it on the menu is always a nice surprise. Me? I'm in the mood for a cocktail, and went for the gin based Pendinnis. Without saying the sparkling was festive and was the perfect way to start the evening. But you cocktail lovers, the Pendennis belongs in the cocktail hall of fame. Rich in top shelf gin flavor and finished with citrus. This drink was amazing, and will forever seek it out on my next trip to Spruce. Oh yes, there will be a next time.\n\nWhile sipping on our drinks, we browsed the menu and made our selections. My wife was a green mood and went with the goat cheese green salad. Perfectly dressed and balanced, if you are a salad fan you will not be disappointed. Me? it's January and it's soup season. Cauliflower soup! I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this complex, yet comfort driven soup was. The spices and base (including a farm fresh egg) serve as the base while the liquid portion is served over the top. I am still dreaming of this soup.\n\nOur wine for evening? Now this can be a stressful situation for anyone. Especially with a wine list that's over 80 pages (single spaced) long. Enter Lauren (our sommelier) , she made what is potentially a \"wtf, I can't even pronounce half the labels on the menu\" into a \"OMG, this is the best bottle ever!\". My eye caught glimpse on several French variatels  that (in my opinion) were aggressively priced. $150 for a 1986? Yes, it sounds expensive, but did you hear what I said? 1-9-8-8-6? You tell me, where in the Hell are going to find an amazing bottle with this kind of age for $150?? And what blew my mind, there were several bottles priced on the list around this price (and below)! Lauren's description of our wine for the night was spot on! In all my years on Earth, never have I encountered a more knowledge Sommelier than Lauren. \n\nOur main selections? My wife went with the pork tenderloin, me the ribeye. Both were cooked to perfection and hardly a bite left on each of our plates. Of course, we had to share a side of French fries. The fries are what legends are made.\n\nDavid to Lauren, the entire staff, thank you for helping make our night a memorable one.

"], "author": "Veronika P.", "review": "I am utterly shocked by the high praise heaped upon this restaurant. My first time there was about three years ago and I was underwhelmed by the food, but thought the problem was the dish I ordered. I went again last night with a friend visiting from out of town, figuring this dinner would be the culmination of a weekend of fabulous food: dinners at Chiaroscuro and Piperade and brunch on Saturday at Nopa. We ate lightly on Sunday in anticipation of our meal at Spruce.\n\nFirst, the interior \"ain't all that.\" I know art is in the eye of the beholder, but I wondered WTF a picture of an Adidas t-shirt was doing on the wall. The leather on the backs of the dining room chairs was sagging, as if the chairs weren't all that well made and weren't holding up. The solid cocoa brown interior with dark wood furniture made the restaurant feel somber. Cool chandelier made from wine bottles, though. A beautiful flower arrangement in the dining room could have livened things up.\n\nI wanted a glass of red wine with an earthy undertone. The waitperson brought me a taste of a wine she recommended, and although it wasn't what I had in mind, I liked it and ordered a glass. My friend wasn't so fortunate. She asked our waitperson for a cocktail recommendation: she wanted \"something made with brown alcohol but not too sweet.\" The \"Whiskey Smash\" was suggested. My friend didn't particularly like it after her first sip and put it aside. During the entire meal, the waitperson, her \"assistant\" (that's the word she used to describe him), a guy I assumed was a manager and the sommelier all visited our table, but no one ever asked her if there was an issue with her barely-touched cocktail.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the rolls were nicely warmed, but the quality was slightly better than supermarket Parker rolls. The interior was dry and made me wonder if perhaps they don't get a fresh bread delivery on Sundays.\n\nWe ordered an off-menu appetizer special: baby mustard greens with blue cheese, speck (Prosciutto-like ham), figs and what was described as \"lavosh-type\" crackers. The greens were interesting in that they had a frisee-like texture and a little bite. I think they would have been terrific, finely chopped and sprinkled over a butter lettuce salad or as garnish on a soup. The blue cheese was described as originating in Wisconsin and aged in a California cave (huh?!). It tasted like a blue cheese you could pick up at Trader Joe's (no disrespect to TJ's intended!). The figs were grilled Mission figs, nothing to write home about. The \"lavosh\" was sweet and looked and tasted like a cookie. No two ingredients in this dish tasted good together.  The manager (again, I'm not completely sure that was his role) came over to ask if we liked the salad, and since he asked, I told him what we didn't like about it (pretty much everything) and provided suggestions as to how it might be improved. We never saw that guy again, although to be fair, the appetizer was removed from our bill.\n\nWe also shared another appetizer, a summer vegetable salad, made with Little Gem romaine, hazelnuts, Pecorino and a Romesco sauce. Another case of the elements of the dish not really complementing one another, although each item was tasty.\n\nWhile we were sharing our appetizers, the sommelier stopped by to ask if I wanted a refill on my wine. I thought I'd give it another shot and again requested an earthy red. He brought me two tastes, neither of which was particularly earthy, but again, nothing wrong with them so I selected one to have with dinner.\n \nFor our main courses, I ordered the pork tenderloin with pork belly and my friend ordered the short ribs. The pork belly was excellent! It was crispy on top with a firm interior and amazing flavor. The pork tenderloin, although tender and perfectly cooked, wasn't particularly exciting (I kept thinking about a pork chop I had for dinner at Nopa a couple of months ago that has set a new pork dish standard). The pork medallions were served on a bed of shelling beans which were a little firm for my taste. I would have liked the bean interiors to be a bit creamier. I'd ordered the short ribs my other time at Spruce and was unimpressed, but I didn't say anything to my friend, since I honestly figured they'd be great this time. She had the same complaint I had three years ago: although served in a tasty sauce, the meat itself was stringy and dry. She actually said they were the worst short ribs she'd ever had.\n\nAfter such a mediocre meal, we didn't bother with desert. Our tab came to $134 before the tip and after the special blue cheese & speck appetizer had been removed. If you're in that neighborhood, I'd recommend Garibaldi's instead, or leave Presidio Heights behind and head over to Nopa.

Our waiter greeted us and asked for our choice of water.  After going through the menu, our waiter described the specials and answered our questions about preparation of dishes were considering.\n\nBread service included a cranberry bread, wheat bread, and a rustic roll. Opted for the cranberry bread, which was soft and tasty and the roll, which was soft with a rustic chewy texture.\n\nOur orders:\nStrorzzapreti with foraged mushrooms, pole beans, brown butter sabayon topped with truffles. The truffles were in season and shipped in France. Had to get 3grams on our shared order, which they placed into portions.  This dish was rich, but it was so delicious.\n\nNori popcorn - before our entrees, we were served a bowl nori popcorn.\n\nGrilled local albacore tuna with vegetables provencal, smoked roe, crispy squash blossom. Had a taste of the nicely seared tuna. Perfectly rare.\n\nRoasted Sonoma Chicken with roulade farci, bluefoot mushrooms, corn fritters. The chicken was beautifully presented. The breast was slight pink and so moist. The roulade made from the dark meat was stuffed with a mushroom filling. I don't normally order chicken, but was glad I ordered this.\n\nBirthday mousse cake - a complementary mousse cake with fresh fruit was presented to the celebrant.  The mousse was firm, which I thought made it more like a cake.  It was delicious. \n\nBeignets with seasonal preserves and cr\u00e8me anglaise. These were not the traditional New Orleans beignets. They were soft fluffy balls and I love the cr\u00e8me anglaise that was full of vanilla.\n\nLichee marshmallows and fruit jellies. Nice complementary after dinner sweets.\n\nComplementary chocolates. Who doesn't like homemade chocolates. \n\nAlso, a giant chocolate chip cookie was provided as a departing gift to our birthday celebrant.\nIt was a great birthday celebration. Our server, Justin provided impeccable service. The serving crew were friendly and the overall service was not overbearing.
