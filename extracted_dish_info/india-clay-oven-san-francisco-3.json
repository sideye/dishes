This is a nice little touch that helps diners old and new alike who like to know what goes into a dish.\n\nNo, we're not talking recipes, but they say that the Chana Masala is spicy garbanzo beans, or that the Saag Paneer is cooked spinach with homemade cheese cubes, you get the drift.  Before, you may have wondered, \"What do they put in these dishes?\"  Not in a bad, pejorative way, just a curiosity about Indian-style cooking.\n\nTheir tandoori chicken is still done quite well and it isn't dry at all, unless it is on the bottom of the pan and the sterno has heated it dry.  In an effort to keep their food warm and moist, they've taken to covering the opening with aluminum foil and leaving enough of an opening so that you can reach the food with the tongs or spoon.  This is especially true of their pakoras, the rice pilav, and the tandoori chicken.  Those do tend to dry out faster from heat and exposure.  The other dishes are in sauces, so they are not covered.  Their green salad is fresh and crisp, not dry and lifeless.  I've yet to see them use any ingredients that aren't fresh or are subpar.  They do a good job with their food preparation, which is VISIBLE, not IMPLIED.\n\nAgain, their service is really good and unobtrusive, and they are family friendly.  I have seen kids (and some babies) in tow and they seem to be okay with the food, too.  In my previous review, I mentioned that their curry isn't too overpowering, and that's held true.  Although, I must say that lately I've experienced a slightly sore throat the day after.  That's probably more me than anything else, so don't knock them for that.\n\nIf you're looking for good Indian/Pakistani food, then you should come here.  It's a much better dining experience.  The other Indian buffet place, Great India, just doesn't cut it.\n\nTheir interior is somewhat gloomy and I don't see many diners in their when I walk past.

The entryway is very pretty, and the inside of the restaurant has ceiling-to-floor glass walls, making for potentially romantic lighting during the evening.

Place was fairly empty when we walked in, so we weren't sure what to expect, but our food all came in delicious. First came the vegetable samosas and garlic nan, both of which were crisp and well-seasoned. Potatoes inside the samosas were salt-and-buttery, a contrast to the sweetness and firmness of the peas, and wonderful with or without the sharp sauce provided to eat it with. (There's two that you're given - a sweet, darker sauce, almost syrupy, and a hot green dip. Both are lovely.)\n\nThen the entrees. I ordered the Punjabi lamb curry (requested extra spicy) and my companion the aloo matter with an additional side of jasmine rice. Rice was a little dry, but otherwise fine. The curry - which the waiter put on the table with a rather concerned look - was a pleasant burn, spicy enough to enflame my otherwise heat-tolerant mouth and put a warm ache in my stomach. Word of warning: I do love spicy food, so for the uninitiated please proceed with caution if you want to go with my recommendation.\n\nFor the $14 or so I spent on it the proportion of lamb to sauce was staggering! Very generous with the meat, and properly cooked as well, both of which are two strong bonuses in my book. My companion reported that her food was delicious as well, but I wasn't able to get a detailed report from her. I trust her judgement, though.\n\nTaking off a star only because the waiter was nearly silent. Not unwelcoming or unfriendly, just a bit off-putting. I'm not asking for Chik-Fil-A levels of friendliness, but even a \"hello, how's your evening going\" or \"how was the food\" would've sufficed.
