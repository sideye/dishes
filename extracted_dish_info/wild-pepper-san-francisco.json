West lake beef soup - a creamy, slightly salty Chinese soup that has some mushrooms, beef bits, and egg. It was nice and savory, and enough soup for 3 pple, definitely try this! Presentation of the soup was so pretty, it could have been in a food catalog. \n\n2. Garlic pea sprout - if you want a Chinese vegetable dish, try this! Pea sprout is usually more expensive at other restaurants but here it was reasonable. Portion size is great, not too oily, slightly salty and garlic taste. \n\n3. Vegetable spring rolls - yummy appetizer, comes out piping hot. Also I'm a sucker for spring rolls\n\n4. Wild Pepper seafood basket - an assortment of seafood and vegetables (shrimp, scallops, peas, cucumber, mushroom, broccoli, carrots, etc) cooked together and placed into a crisp bowl-shaped pancake. Best part of this dish was the presentation. The seafood and vegetables were not burnt, was tender and not dry, and just the right amount of oil. The one bad thing was it was a bit saltier than necessary. \n\n5. Wild Pepper chicken - pretty good. There was chicken, bell peppers, mushrooms, cucumber, tossed together w a flavorful slightly salty sauce. Really yummy with rice. Comes spicy but you can adjust for less or more. \n\nI'm happy to say my mom was happy w the meal (disaster avoided!!) and our total meal cost was about $50 but we ordered so much we basically paid for two dinners for us both.

Lemon fish is crispy with a greasless batter and a thick but not overpowering and too thick of a lemon sauce.  Jade shrimp is succulent with fresh spinach, bamboo shoots, and fresh bean curd in a light sauce.  The house special lo mein is a plethora of ground pork, onions, and a mild brown sauce that tasted like it could have been bean sauce (what am I saying, it was just that.)  I will definitely be returning to try the won tons in chili sauce, ants climbing up a tree, and the Szechwan crispy beef.  As I say in all of my reviews, great food, service, atmosphere, and prices; what more could you ask for?!  Oh,! I enjoyed the Kenny G music which they had playing (probably his Greatest Hits, Best of, or Very Best Of CD.)  It made the experience all the more enjoyable and relaxing.

The owner, though possibly a little brusque at first, is genuinely kind, and concerned about the enjoyment of your meal. Though a little oily, the veggies are not overcooked, and the portions are certainly generous. \n\nI find it a bit annoying when Yelpers give a restaurant a horrible rating based on the timeliness of the delivery alone. That isn't very helpful to readers who are interested in the quality of the food, and not just whether the meal will be brought to their doorstep promptly.  The first time I ate Wild Pepper I did order delivery -- and was not that happy with the food, mostly because I ordered General Tso's, or maybe Sesame, meatless chicken, against my better judgement, and it is basically a pile of deep fried breaded-ness.  I also ordered the soft tofu and green onion salad and similarly, it was exactly what you would expect, and not very impressive.\n\nThis time around I ate at the restaurant, and purposefully ordered way too much food so I could try a few things and have leftovers for later.  Worried that every meatless chicken dish would be like the first, but just with different sauce, I asked the owner / waiter if it was always fried, and he said I could order any of the meatless chicken dishes not fried.  I went for Szechuan since I like spicy and it seemed popular from the reviews.  I also ordered Hunan Eggplant and the Monk's Garden Soup. I had heard the Monk's Soup came with \"vegetable balls\" so I checked to make sure there was no egg and was reassured a couple times that it was vegan (in a respectful, not obnoxious way).\n\nThe soup could easily be a meal for one in itself. I thought the broth was a bit bland but the veggies were good and the vegetable balls were dangerously addictive.  The balls aren't necessarily eaten in the soup; they come on the side and are nice and crispy on their own (and there's a lot of them!). They were sort of like little Chinese pakoras.\n\nThe eggplant and \"chicken\" came out a bit later.  I was too full to eat much of them, but found them pretty good, but maybe because I didn't have very high expectations. I did think the sauces were a little similar and not nearly as spicy as I would have liked.  If you like spicy, emphasize it upon ordering--even if you say you like spicy, you should probably be clear that you like it really, extra spicy (not, you know, Midwestern American spicy). The Szechuan meatless chicken had a sort of black bean sauce with some jalapenos and came with a mix of vegetables. I found I liked the meatless chicken a lot better when it wasn't breaded and sauced into oblivion, though the texture is more like a firm tofu than \"meat.\" Though I was full, I kept snacking on the firm little cubes. The eggplant was soft, just like I like it, stir-fried with bell peppers and onions. \n\nI was satisfied with my meal, and similarly my curiosity about Wild Pepper is satisfied as well. Since I don't live in the neighborhood, I probably won't make an effort to go back--and I think Enjoy Vegetarian is better.  But it's a decent option for the Mission if you don't mind spending about $10 a person.

"], "author": "Allen S.", "review": "This is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco. My rating is going to be based on four categories. Food, service, atmosphere and price. \n\nThe ingredients here taste like they were picked from a garden in the back of the restaurant. Everything is fresh as can be and the mix of flavors are some of the tastiest I've ever experienced. I like eating plant based food and Wild Pepper has textured, flavored, soy that they call meatless chicken. It is FANTASTIC!!! My favorite dishes are Wild Pepper meatless chicken, tomato beef chow fun, vegetable wonton soup, avocado spring rolls, onion pancakes (their peanut sauce is thicker and tastes much better than creamy peanut sauce), and green tea ice cream for dessert. Try the General Tsao, Broccoli beef, Kung Pao and Vegetarian Delight entr\u00e9es as well. \n\nI always tip 25% here because the service is constantly superb. Ming, the creator and owner, puts his heart and soul into this business. It's easy to tell his culinary experience by the quality and diversity of Chinese cuisine he serves plus his management experience is evident in how well the restaurant operations are run. The staff is extremely friendly and kind, always helping before I ask for assistance and listening to everything I and my friends ask for. John and Alice specifically do an exceptional job keeping me happy and expressing interest in friendship with me, which makes me very happy. The chefs always do an exceptional job listening to even the smallest of details to ensure customer satisfaction which always makes people happy knowing they are being taken great care of. \n\nThe ambiance here just perfectly brings me into Chinese culture, even though I'm in the Mission district of San Francisco. They have soft cultural music playing, historic decorations on the walls and on the floors and an exceptionally clean venue. They incorporate plants into their ambiance as well which I love because it brings a more natural feel. \n\nThe appetizers are priced around $5 and the entr\u00e9es around $10 which are extremely reasonable because the portions are HUGE!! I am a big man who eats a lot of food and I can barely finish one $10 entr\u00e9e which turns into a second meal later in the day or the next day, so I end up paying $10 for two delicious meals which I love doing!! In terms of San Francisco prices, this is an absolute jem because normally I would be expecting to pay closer to $15-$20 for the same entr\u00e9es. \n\nAll in all, I hope my review has better helped you understand why Wild Pepper is a must dine in San Francisco. The combination of high quality food, phenomenal service and ambiance as well as great price is difficult to find in San Francisco and Wild Pepper does them all and more.

"], "author": "Tamara F.", "review": "I've lived in the Mission temporarily for a number of weeks over the past year, and as a vegan who typically enjoys spicy Asian food, I've been drawn to Wild Pepper twice, even though it's not the healthiest, and I'm not a big fan of fake meat, anyway.\n\nIn general, they leave a good impression.  The owner, though possibly a little brusque at first, is genuinely kind, and concerned about the enjoyment of your meal. Though a little oily, the veggies are not overcooked, and the portions are certainly generous. \n\nI find it a bit annoying when Yelpers give a restaurant a horrible rating based on the timeliness of the delivery alone. That isn't very helpful to readers who are interested in the quality of the food, and not just whether the meal will be brought to their doorstep promptly.  The first time I ate Wild Pepper I did order delivery -- and was not that happy with the food, mostly because I ordered General Tso's, or maybe Sesame, meatless chicken, against my better judgement, and it is basically a pile of deep fried breaded-ness.  I also ordered the soft tofu and green onion salad and similarly, it was exactly what you would expect, and not very impressive.\n\nThis time around I ate at the restaurant, and purposefully ordered way too much food so I could try a few things and have leftovers for later.  Worried that every meatless chicken dish would be like the first, but just with different sauce, I asked the owner / waiter if it was always fried, and he said I could order any of the meatless chicken dishes not fried.  I went for Szechuan since I like spicy and it seemed popular from the reviews.  I also ordered Hunan Eggplant and the Monk's Garden Soup. I had heard the Monk's Soup came with \"vegetable balls\" so I checked to make sure there was no egg and was reassured a couple times that it was vegan (in a respectful, not obnoxious way).\n\nThe soup could easily be a meal for one in itself. I thought the broth was a bit bland but the veggies were good and the vegetable balls were dangerously addictive.  The balls aren't necessarily eaten in the soup; they come on the side and are nice and crispy on their own (and there's a lot of them!). They were sort of like little Chinese pakoras.\n\nThe eggplant and \"chicken\" came out a bit later.  I was too full to eat much of them, but found them pretty good, but maybe because I didn't have very high expectations. I did think the sauces were a little similar and not nearly as spicy as I would have liked.  If you like spicy, emphasize it upon ordering--even if you say you like spicy, you should probably be clear that you like it really, extra spicy (not, you know, Midwestern American spicy). The Szechuan meatless chicken had a sort of black bean sauce with some jalapenos and came with a mix of vegetables. I found I liked the meatless chicken a lot better when it wasn't breaded and sauced into oblivion, though the texture is more like a firm tofu than \"meat.\" Though I was full, I kept snacking on the firm little cubes. The eggplant was soft, just like I like it, stir-fried with bell peppers and onions. \n\nI was satisfied with my meal, and similarly my curiosity about Wild Pepper is satisfied as well. Since I don't live in the neighborhood, I probably won't make an effort to go back--and I think Enjoy Vegetarian is better.  But it's a decent option for the Mission if you don't mind spending about $10 a person.
