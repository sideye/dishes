I was born in Lima Peru and have been to all the Peruvian places in SF at least once and this little place (4 or 5 tables and 5 seats at the counter) inside Plaza Adelante (19th and mission) is so authentic and reminds me most of the flavors of the food of Peru. It's been open a few weeks and I learned that the owner / chef Yeral Caldas is from Chimbote north of Lima. The only sign for this place is a sign on the street .\n\nI first tried the fish ceviche. I always use this as a barometer of the quality of food. My belief is if you can't make great ceviche (Peru's national dish) then Im not going to be expecting much else from the menu. The ceviche here is Swai also known as Iridescent shark or shark catfish. Just to be 100% clear, this is a fish similar to US catfish NOT shark. Its flesh is slightly sweet and has a milder flavor and more delicate texture than US catfish. I like it much more than tilapia which a lot of Peruvian spots use. It was awesome. My favorite ceviche in SF right now. The price is only $5! \nI should mention that this place is super cheap. Coffee for $1.30 and $1.60 and cappuccino for $2.50 just to give you an idea. The most expensive dish is $10. \n\nAfter this place passed (with flying colors) the ceviche test, I tried the Papa Huancaina (slightly warm Yukon Gold potato salad with Huancaina sauce. The main ingredients are; aji amarillo peppers , cheese and saltine crackers. Its a great side dish that has a cheesy taste with a little spice at the end. Price is $5 \n\nI went a few days later to try the Arroz con Pato. (Roast duck with a green cilantro rice)  It was a leg and thigh and had carrots and peas tossed in. Great portion size and it was tender and had a little onion salsa on top. I asked for rocoto sauce (spicy red pepper) to go with it since I'm addicted to spice. I found out that Yeral makes his own sauce and pretty much makes everything himself. Price $10.\n\nThis place is a little authentic spot and I've seen it crowded with mostly Peruvians. It's refreshing to go to a place with no Yelp reviews that seems to be under the radar. Its SO cheap that I eat here a few times a week now. His hours are 7am to 5 pm Monday to Saturday. Cholo Soy reminds me of a Mexican \"fonda\" A small place were workers and people go to get a quick casual bite. In peru they are called huariques.

Only downside is I wish they had more tables for people to sit in. It is really growing in popularity among not just peruvian clientele but general clientele! Another plus that this place has is the Peruvian regulars that show up and catch up with one another never forgetting to say hi to other regulars in their awesome Peruvian slang. Expect salsa and Peruvian Cumbia to play in the background that will definitely add to your dining experience,(something other places like \"fresca\", \"limon\" lack in my opinion) This little spot is the closest thing us Peruvians in San Francisco will get to being back home, I love it!

Sorry honey, but not everyone can afford an $800 Valentino iPad case or have the means to regularly fly to Paris for a $70 lip balm. At least she doesn't give a shit about being the most hated celebrity in hollywood. Props to her for that.\n\nCholo Soy is a place that would get Paltrow's French silk panties all up in a bunch. It's located in lobby of Plaza Adelante; next to Dr. Teeth. The soulful, Peruvian cuisine draws humble working class carb-loving carniwhores. \"Carbs are evil and meat is dirty\", according to her. Whatever Paltrow, go suck on a cucumber. The rotating menu is in Spanish and offers three slow braised meat entrees per a day served with rice and beans. Appetizers of ceviche and causa are available every day. All the dishes are $5, $6, or $10. Menu: http://bit.ly/1cNrb5X and http://bit.ly/18hpT0e. Cash only.\n\nTheir current opening hours are limited because it's based on when the plaza is open. However, the owner told us they plan on extending their hours and open on Sundays in the future once they work something out with the plaza's owner.\n\nThere's only three tables and counter seating available so come during off peak hours if you wanna grub in or you can always take your order to go. We grabbed the last available table a little after 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon. We were also the only non-natives there and I'm sure stuck out like a sore thumb but the welcoming owner didn't make us feel that way. This is one of the reasons WHY I phucking love this place. You know it's legit when all the customers are natives and there's not any hipsters in sight...yet.\n\nThe only thing I could decipher off the menu was the Ceviche ($5): http://bit.ly/IArVld. I'm usually not a fan of ceviche as I find the citrus to overpower the delicateness of the fish but this one was solid especially for the price tag. The fish was firm and the leche de tigre was bold without causing you to pucker your lips. I love the accompanying fried corn kernels for the satisfying crunchy texture contrast. \n\nWe shared two entrees, the Cabrito Norteno de Cordero (lamb shank - $10) and Guisado Norteno de Pollo (chicken - $6) which were both excellent. You can tell they were a labor of love having been stewed for hours. The chicken was fall-of-the-bone tender and filled with savory deliciousness: http://bit.ly/18hqy1w. The fork tender lamb shank was robust with spices: http://bit.ly/1b9aljr. I normally don't care for beans but the accompanying beans had a lovely richness to them. \n\nI washed everything down with a Chica Morado (purple corn drink - $2) which was refreshing and not too sweet: http://bit.ly/18b75ms. \n\nCholo Soy is the epitome of Peruvian homestyle cooking at its finest. You also gotta love that it's very easy on the wallet. Well Mr. NSS did. Our entire meal cost less than one-thirds of Paltrow's lip balm!

It's in the Plaza Adelante at 19th and Mission where they've carved out a space for themselves in the downstairs lobby. Despite how that sounds it's light, spacious and tidy. You can sit at the bar or at the 3 tables. \n\nFor such a small space they've done a nice job of making it feel welcome. Everyone is friendly, there are printed menus with descriptions in English and there's even table service. It seemed pretty mellow during a weekday lunch. No problem getting a table.\n\nThe three of us ordered several dishes to share for lunch - \n\n    * ceviche ($7.50) - I can understand why people say this is the best ceviche ever, fresh fish, mild citrus (not too tangy or sour), utterly delicious. I would come back just to get the ceviche for myself. I loved the crunchy corn kernels and the hotsauce to jazz it up.\n\n    * escabeche de pollo (~$10) - stewed chicken drumstick on a bed of rice or lentils, well cooked but not that interesting\n\n    * carapulcra de chancho (~$12) - two hunks of pork with rice, which doesn't do it justice because it's super tasty and the sauce is really good. \n\nWe all got the chicha morada drink ($2). Not as interesting as I thought. Just tasted like a sweet soft drink. \n\nLunch was around $17 per person including tax and tip. But it was too much food.

I was born in Lima Peru and have been to all the Peruvian places in SF at least once and this little place (4 or 5 tables and 5 seats at the counter) inside Plaza Adelante (19th and mission) is so authentic and reminds me most of the flavors of the food of Peru.

The ceviche here is Swai also known as Iridescent shark or shark catfish. Just to be 100% clear, this is a fish similar to US catfish NOT shark.

Great portion size and it was tender and had a little onion salsa on top. I asked for rocoto sauce (spicy red pepper) to go with it since I'm addicted to spice.
