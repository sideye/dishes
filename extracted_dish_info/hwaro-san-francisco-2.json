Good riddens with your $20 crappy burger served on a plastic plate, $7 sharing fee, and side of stank face. \n\nAside from awesome taquerias, Excelsior's food scene is non-existent until Hwaro soft opened a month ago. The menu is a mix of traditional and fusion Korean dishes (from Kimchi Jjigae to Korean Tacos). Prices are reasonable for SF standards and portions were generous. It's currently BYOB until they get their liquor license so definitely stop by Kukje beforehand and bring in soju and beer. Reservations accepted. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\nThe banchans: kimchi  and cucumber salad were weak which is usually a bad sign for a Korean restaurant but the food turned out pretty decent.

The KFC batter is thick and crunchy and the chicken was moist and juicy. It was underseasoned but I prefer that over it being overly salty. The garlic mixture was raw, minced garlic and sugar. It was unappetizingly astringent and cloyingly sweet so we scraped it off. I didn't try the sweet spicy one.

Instead, she was having a full, sit down meal with her dining companion at the bar for the majority of time we were there (2.5 hours). Obviously, her restaurant, her rules but it came off unprofessional.\n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nThe space is minimalist and hipster. Good for parties of 2-4 and there's two communal tables that fit 6 people each. When we arrived, the ambiance was very upbeat and lively with the pop music that was playing...just as any fun Korean restaurant should be (like Playground, Tonight, The Spot, and Toyose). \n\nThe music soon turned into odd mix of slow, depressing jazz tracks when the owner started having dinner at the bar. Since the music was dampening the mood, my friend's bf kindly provided feedback to one of the servers. She spoke with the owner who changed it for half a track, then changed it back to the slow, jazz music, and returned to dinner with her dining companion at the bar. Again, her restaurant, her rules but she didn't seem receptive to feedback which is unfortunate. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~ \nDifficult street parking. \n\nHwaro is the first and only Korean restaurant in the area serving pretty solid food.

He spent the rest of dinner convincing himself (and me) that these fries are old fries (when I say old, I mean fries that have been left out for a few hours) from McDonald's. Everyone knows what leftover McDonald's fries tastes like, and these kimchi fries definitely tasted like that. Don't get me wrong, the fries were pretty delicious (although it would've been better if the fries were waffle fries, so it can hold the kimchi and sauce more)! But the thought that these fries may have been possibly from McDonald's was just so shocking. \n\nAnyway, enough about the fries. The Taco Trio was very flavorful. It's an appetizer, but I think it's enough to be a meal on it's own. Kimchi Fried Rice was pretty good, good amount of spiciness but lacked a bit of salt. I was not a fan of the Japchae.

YES!\n\nI was a bit upset when I saw Goldilocks close. I had recently been there and while it was my third favorite Filipino restaurant in Excelsior, they did introduce me to some new stuff.\n\nMy mood changed when I saw the sign on the door saying the new place was Hwaro, a Korean restaurant. Excelsior has Filipino, Japanese, Thai, Laotian, Vietnamese, all types of Chinese. But we don't have Korean. \n\nLet alone one that serves alcohol.\n\nThis week they are going through a soft launch - they don't officially open or have a working credit card until 9/5/16 - but are taking customers. The lunch menu is very different from the dinner, which also explains the large break in between.\n\nWhen I walked in on a Tuesday, there were a few groups eating - and I do recommend coming here in a group or on a date so you can try more. I sat by myself and spent time on the menu. They have a number of small plates that sound great like the Taco Trio, gyoza, and asparagus because something has to be green. \n\nThere are also big plates which are must shares. Three types of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), kimchee fried rice, seafood pancakes, tonkatsu. They have Korean ramen and a Hangover Soup! \n\nI went with the sizzling BBQ eel. I love eel, heck I've had eel fried rice directly across the street. The great waitress warned me it was only 6 pieces but that was enough for tonight. Along with it came some lettuce to make wraps, some banchan, and I ordered a side of rice. It was delicious and it will be hard not to order it again.\n\nOr live out a dream and special order a BBQ eel taco.\n\nAfter finishing up I got to talk to the two waitresses, the owner Ina jamming out to classic bossanova, and the head chef Ryan. They explained some of the backstory, how they will soon be getting three types of Korean beer (including Hite!), shoju, and wine, and that the neighborhood has welcomed them. \n\nI really like Hwaro and feel it not only adds a culinary option to Excelsior, but adds a more modern option as well. With Rocks Den, Sushi Raw, and now Hwaro, this part of Excelsior is getting some gentrification. Not white people (says the white person), but more gentrifying for Millenials - modern locations with a modern vibe. I don't want the area to be completely changed - I may actually be addicted to Baby's lumpia - but I like that we are getting options to take groups or dates to. Excelsior isn't only for cheap lunch, and Hwaro helps this.\n\nUPDATE: I came over for lunch and got the sweet and spicy fried chicken bento and the pork belly quesadilla. The bento came with side salad, some of the least greasy japchae I've ever had, two dumplings, rice, kimchi and 4 wings covered in sauce. Ask for extra napkins! I definitely got a lot of sauce on my face/beard. The wings were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was both sweet and spicy. Not bad for the amount of food I got.\n\nBut the pork belly quesadilla stole the show! I want one right now. Full of delicious pork belly, kimchi, cheese, sauce, and I want to say butter because it was decadent. Still can't wait to bring people here.\n\nUpdate 9/18: Took two friends here for dinner to finally get a group dinner going. We got:\n-Corn Cheese - basically a skillet filled with sweet corn and mozzarella cheese. Two things I love\n-Gyoza - I'm a sucker for dumplings\n-Rice Cake Skewers - Because it was my birthday, the owner gave these to us on the house, and explained that growing up in Korea, this was one of her favorite street food snacks. We got two skewers with about 5 rice cakes on top, covered in the sweet and spicy sauce from the chicken wings. If you like sweet and spicy, these are really good, a bit chewy. Glad I got to try these!\n-Kimchee Pancake - one of my guests doesn't like seafood, which is why we got this. Turns out he also doesn't like kimchee, SMH. This was delicious.\n-Kimchee Fried Rice - yeah, my friend didn't have the best meal, but his loss. This was delicious, spicy fried rice with some seaweed which gives it a really interesting flavor. But man that pork belly is so good.\n\nOh, and for my return trip I was recommended trying the miso pork belly.\n\nAlso they have the cleanest bathroom in Excelsior.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["My friends ordered bibimbap, taco trio, and kimchi fried rice with pork (?), while I ordered tteokbokki with ramen.

My friend got hit on by an old man, another old man waving at us from above his apartment with a Chucky doll, and there were even boys calling us from across the street.

Overall, for the location and experience I would have given it a 1 or 2 star(s).\n\nNOW ONTO THE FOOD.

We got really lucky and found parking right in front! From looking through yelp reviews to see what was most popular, we decided to order the taco trio, cheese corn, and Korean ramen with spam and kimchi for two people. We also ended up getting a bottle of peach soju to go with our meal :) Everything turned out to be super yummy and we ended up finishing everything we ordered! (This doesn't happen a lot because I usually get full really easily) \n\nI really enjoyed the Korean ramen, especially on a cold, rainy day. It's a bit different from the tofu soup at other Korean restaurants with ramen added to it, but I really like the flavoring and the ramen texture here. I would definitely order this again. You have the options of adding cheese, spam or kimchi for an additional price - I believe it was $1/$2 for each item. We decided to go with just the spam and kimchi since we're already having a lot of cheese from the cheese corn! \n\nThe cheese corn has a nice presentation and tastes pretty good as well! I like how it has the Panko/fried bread crumbs along the sides and some siracha sauce on top. It is not the best cheese corn that I've ever had, but it is pretty good and unique from the other cheese corn dishes I've had at other places. \n\nThe taco trio was super juicy and flavorful! It has three different kinds of meat I believe and I enjoyed all of them! :) i wouldn't mind if there was a little bit less of that orange sauce though, it was a bit too saucy for me, but that probably varies and I don't mind it too much so I would definitely order this again. Maybe next time there will be less orange sauce on it and not drenched like this time! \n\nI am looking forward to coming back and trying more items on the menu. Maybe the wings next time?

These were filled with variations of lettuce, kimchi, bulgogi, spicy pork, and a creamy mayo-based sauce to tie everything together. \n- Garlic pork belly BBQ plate: We were debating between this and the galbi, and I'm so happy we went with pork belly! Tender and flavorful, and went well with the lettuce wraps (wish they gave only lettuce, the cabbage included was odd). I enjoyed the mini trio of sides that came with it (kimchi, cucumber, sauce) to enjoy the pork belly+lettuce with. Highly recommend! \n- Seafood pancake: Although I wish it was a tad bit crispier, this was delicious and made for a wonderful appetizer. Dipping sauce was yummy--I wish it came with more!\n\nOthers:\n- Kimchi cheese: Okay, I LOVE kimchi, but keep in mind that a lot of their dishes already come with kimchi. This dish was kimchi-overkill, especially noting that the majority of our dishes had or came with kimchi. I would pass on this one, and would try their cheese corn instead for some variety.\n- Kimchi fried rice: It was good, nothing extraordinary. Standard kimchi fried rice that didn't have any wow factor for me.\n- Garlic fried chicken: The garlic is apparently sweetened with combined sugar, but it just tasted (and definitely felt) like raw garlic to me. I would pass on this one.\n- Sweet n' spicy fried chicken: If you like a lot of sauce on your wings, then this might be for you!

YES!\n\nI was a bit upset when I saw Goldilocks close. I had recently been there and while it was my third favorite Filipino restaurant in Excelsior, they did introduce me to some new stuff.\n\nMy mood changed when I saw the sign on the door saying the new place was Hwaro, a Korean restaurant. Excelsior has Filipino, Japanese, Thai, Laotian, Vietnamese, all types of Chinese. But we don't have Korean. \n\nLet alone one that serves alcohol.\n\nThis week they are going through a soft launch - they don't officially open or have a working credit card until 9/5/16 - but are taking customers. The lunch menu is very different from the dinner, which also explains the large break in between.\n\nWhen I walked in on a Tuesday, there were a few groups eating - and I do recommend coming here in a group or on a date so you can try more. I sat by myself and spent time on the menu. They have a number of small plates that sound great like the Taco Trio, gyoza, and asparagus because something has to be green. \n\nThere are also big plates which are must shares. Three types of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), kimchee fried rice, seafood pancakes, tonkatsu. They have Korean ramen and a Hangover Soup! \n\nI went with the sizzling BBQ eel. I love eel, heck I've had eel fried rice directly across the street. The great waitress warned me it was only 6 pieces but that was enough for tonight. Along with it came some lettuce to make wraps, some banchan, and I ordered a side of rice. It was delicious and it will be hard not to order it again.\n\nOr live out a dream and special order a BBQ eel taco.\n\nAfter finishing up I got to talk to the two waitresses, the owner Ina jamming out to classic bossanova, and the head chef Ryan. They explained some of the backstory, how they will soon be getting three types of Korean beer (including Hite!), shoju, and wine, and that the neighborhood has welcomed them. \n\nI really like Hwaro and feel it not only adds a culinary option to Excelsior, but adds a more modern option as well. With Rocks Den, Sushi Raw, and now Hwaro, this part of Excelsior is getting some gentrification. Not white people (says the white person), but more gentrifying for Millenials - modern locations with a modern vibe. I don't want the area to be completely changed - I may actually be addicted to Baby's lumpia - but I like that we are getting options to take groups or dates to. Excelsior isn't only for cheap lunch, and Hwaro helps this.\n\nUPDATE: I came over for lunch and got the sweet and spicy fried chicken bento and the pork belly quesadilla. The bento came with side salad, some of the least greasy japchae I've ever had, two dumplings, rice, kimchi and 4 wings covered in sauce. Ask for extra napkins! I definitely got a lot of sauce on my face/beard. The wings were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was both sweet and spicy. Not bad for the amount of food I got.\n\nBut the pork belly quesadilla stole the show! I want one right now. Full of delicious pork belly, kimchi, cheese, sauce, and I want to say butter because it was decadent. Still can't wait to bring people here.\n\nUpdate 9/18: Took two friends here for dinner to finally get a group dinner going. We got:\n-Corn Cheese - basically a skillet filled with sweet corn and mozzarella cheese. Two things I love\n-Gyoza - I'm a sucker for dumplings\n-Rice Cake Skewers - Because it was my birthday, the owner gave these to us on the house, and explained that growing up in Korea, this was one of her favorite street food snacks. We got two skewers with about 5 rice cakes on top, covered in the sweet and spicy sauce from the chicken wings. If you like sweet and spicy, these are really good, a bit chewy. Glad I got to try these!\n-Kimchee Pancake - one of my guests doesn't like seafood, which is why we got this. Turns out he also doesn't like kimchee, SMH. This was delicious.\n-Kimchee Fried Rice - yeah, my friend didn't have the best meal, but his loss. This was delicious, spicy fried rice with some seaweed which gives it a really interesting flavor. But man that pork belly is so good.\n\nOh, and for my return trip I was recommended trying the miso pork belly.\n\nAlso they have the cleanest bathroom in Excelsior.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["The hangover soup is amazing, the perfect amount of meats, veggies and spices to cure the worst of headaches.

We came here from across town based on reviews because we wanted to find a Korean restaurant that was worthy of bringing knowledgeable friends, and the trip was not wasted.  Coming rather early on a Saturday evening, we were greeted warmly and had a choice of tables (They do accept reservations by phone, only when they are open after 5 PM).  We ordered the combination tacos (bulgogi+pork belly, bulgogi+kimchi, and pork belly+kimchi), Portabella mushrooms stuffed with bulgogi, Bibimbop (rice mixed with various ingredients served in a hot stone bowl) , Hangover soup (spicy beef soup), Pork belly and Kalbi (broiled beef short ribs).  They served three little banchan (side dishes), consisting of spinach, kimchi, and a special sauce.  This may sound meager, but all the three items were delicious - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful (best we had among all Korean restaurants in the Bay Area), and the special sauce consisting of miso and hot sauce and garlic was outstanding in flavor!  Much better than many more side dishes which all taste bland as in some other Korean restaurants I reviewed.

They have beer and wine and Korean special beverages - Soju (tastes like weak vodka) and Makgeolli (milky Korean rice wine).  We had both Soju and Makgeolli, but wife wound up ordering Sauvignon blanc (a very good one- Joel Gott).  Although located in a somewhat gentrifying neighborhood, the restaurant has a clean,  modern feel with nice murals, though the chairs could be more comfortable.

The ramen tasted like instant ramen and they tossed in some spicy Korean broth. I was craving noodles that night so it was okay and filling, but I would not recommend ordering this nor would I order this again for $11. \n\nKimchi fried rice had all the right flavors. It was pretty spicy for me and my bf. A simple but filling dish - rice, kimchi, dry seaweed, pork, and a fried egg on top. $13\n\nFavorite of the night was the garlic pork belly. It came out last, BUT tasted so good. Kinda pricy though for $21. If you love garlic like me, then you'll enjoy this dish. Jam-packed with flavor, the garlic pork belly is served on a sizzling plate and is more than enough meat to share with another person.\n\nAll in all, I'd probably come back to try other items if I'm in the area and use that 10% off check in on yelp!", "rating": 3, "date": "2018-01-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Korean ramen, isn't that a no-no?

I went with a big group, so I was able to try a good portion of their menu.\n\nFavorites!\n- Taco trio: love fusion tacos! These were filled with variations of lettuce, kimchi, bulgogi, spicy pork, and a creamy mayo-based sauce to tie everything together. \n- Garlic pork belly BBQ plate: We were debating between this and the galbi, and I'm so happy we went with pork belly! Tender and flavorful, and went well with the lettuce wraps (wish they gave only lettuce, the cabbage included was odd). I enjoyed the mini trio of sides that came with it (kimchi, cucumber, sauce) to enjoy the pork belly+lettuce with. Highly recommend! \n- Seafood pancake: Although I wish it was a tad bit crispier, this was delicious and made for a wonderful appetizer. Dipping sauce was yummy--I wish it came with more!\n\nOthers:\n- Kimchi cheese: Okay, I LOVE kimchi, but keep in mind that a lot of their dishes already come with kimchi. This dish was kimchi-overkill, especially noting that the majority of our dishes had or came with kimchi. I would pass on this one, and would try their cheese corn instead for some variety.\n- Kimchi fried rice: It was good, nothing extraordinary. Standard kimchi fried rice that didn't have any wow factor for me.\n- Garlic fried chicken: The garlic is apparently sweetened with combined sugar, but it just tasted (and definitely felt) like raw garlic to me. I would pass on this one.\n- Sweet n' spicy fried chicken: If you like a lot of sauce on your wings, then this might be for you!

YES!\n\nI was a bit upset when I saw Goldilocks close. I had recently been there and while it was my third favorite Filipino restaurant in Excelsior, they did introduce me to some new stuff.\n\nMy mood changed when I saw the sign on the door saying the new place was Hwaro, a Korean restaurant. Excelsior has Filipino, Japanese, Thai, Laotian, Vietnamese, all types of Chinese. But we don't have Korean. \n\nLet alone one that serves alcohol.\n\nThis week they are going through a soft launch - they don't officially open or have a working credit card until 9/5/16 - but are taking customers. The lunch menu is very different from the dinner, which also explains the large break in between.\n\nWhen I walked in on a Tuesday, there were a few groups eating - and I do recommend coming here in a group or on a date so you can try more. I sat by myself and spent time on the menu. They have a number of small plates that sound great like the Taco Trio, gyoza, and asparagus because something has to be green. \n\nThere are also big plates which are must shares. Three types of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), kimchee fried rice, seafood pancakes, tonkatsu. They have Korean ramen and a Hangover Soup! \n\nI went with the sizzling BBQ eel. I love eel, heck I've had eel fried rice directly across the street. The great waitress warned me it was only 6 pieces but that was enough for tonight. Along with it came some lettuce to make wraps, some banchan, and I ordered a side of rice. It was delicious and it will be hard not to order it again.\n\nOr live out a dream and special order a BBQ eel taco.\n\nAfter finishing up I got to talk to the two waitresses, the owner Ina jamming out to classic bossanova, and the head chef Ryan. They explained some of the backstory, how they will soon be getting three types of Korean beer (including Hite!), shoju, and wine, and that the neighborhood has welcomed them. \n\nI really like Hwaro and feel it not only adds a culinary option to Excelsior, but adds a more modern option as well. With Rocks Den, Sushi Raw, and now Hwaro, this part of Excelsior is getting some gentrification. Not white people (says the white person), but more gentrifying for Millenials - modern locations with a modern vibe. I don't want the area to be completely changed - I may actually be addicted to Baby's lumpia - but I like that we are getting options to take groups or dates to. Excelsior isn't only for cheap lunch, and Hwaro helps this.\n\nUPDATE: I came over for lunch and got the sweet and spicy fried chicken bento and the pork belly quesadilla. The bento came with side salad, some of the least greasy japchae I've ever had, two dumplings, rice, kimchi and 4 wings covered in sauce. Ask for extra napkins! I definitely got a lot of sauce on my face/beard. The wings were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was both sweet and spicy. Not bad for the amount of food I got.\n\nBut the pork belly quesadilla stole the show! I want one right now. Full of delicious pork belly, kimchi, cheese, sauce, and I want to say butter because it was decadent. Still can't wait to bring people here.\n\nUpdate 9/18: Took two friends here for dinner to finally get a group dinner going. We got:\n-Corn Cheese - basically a skillet filled with sweet corn and mozzarella cheese. Two things I love\n-Gyoza - I'm a sucker for dumplings\n-Rice Cake Skewers - Because it was my birthday, the owner gave these to us on the house, and explained that growing up in Korea, this was one of her favorite street food snacks. We got two skewers with about 5 rice cakes on top, covered in the sweet and spicy sauce from the chicken wings. If you like sweet and spicy, these are really good, a bit chewy. Glad I got to try these!\n-Kimchee Pancake - one of my guests doesn't like seafood, which is why we got this. Turns out he also doesn't like kimchee, SMH. This was delicious.\n-Kimchee Fried Rice - yeah, my friend didn't have the best meal, but his loss. This was delicious, spicy fried rice with some seaweed which gives it a really interesting flavor. But man that pork belly is so good.\n\nOh, and for my return trip I was recommended trying the miso pork belly.\n\nAlso they have the cleanest bathroom in Excelsior.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Sweet not spicy\n\nKorean ramen was good too.\n\n"], "author": "Ellie M.", "review": "Really great food!\n\nHas a nice atmosphere, especially if you want a few drinks with your food.\n\nThe food could be spicier, great flavors though.\nYu ke jang: great portion, not a lot of noodles but more beef than most places in SF give.\n\nDukbokki: could have had more rice noodles, but large helping of cheese and ramen on top.

She spoke with the owner who changed it for half a track, then changed it back to the slow, jazz music, and returned to dinner with her dining companion at the bar. Again, her restaurant, her rules but she didn't seem receptive to feedback which is unfortunate. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~ \nDifficult street parking. \n\nHwaro is the first and only Korean restaurant in the area serving pretty solid food.

For the fried chicken, the garlic fried chicken just had a slab of minced garlic placed right on top. When I ate it, didn't know it was going to be like that so I bit right into a huge mouthful of garlic. It's weird how they just put the garlic all on top in one huge chunk. As much as I looove garlic, that was mehhhhh. The sweet spicy flavor on the other hand, was actually really delicious. For the price and the food, I'd much rather go to another Korean restaurant. Service wasn't too great either. However, glad I was able to try this place and unbookmark it.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-07-11"}, {"excerpts": ["(-_^) Garlic Fried Chicken ", "$8/$16 ", "(http://bit.ly/2bTm5OZ)\n", "\"garlic heaven\".

Not many other restaurants besides mexican or chinese food, so korean was a welcome change.\n\nThe interior and decor was very unexpected in a good way.  Modern and minimal design with large open space. \n\nThings we ordered:\n\n- Rice cake skewer\nfried/grilled korean rice cake with a sweet spicy sauce.  Texture was great, crunchy outside, gooey inside.  Sauce was nice and balanced.  One thing I would suggest to make it even better is to add some green onion slices in between the rice cakes. Also some sesame seeds on top.  I think that would bring out another level of flavor.\n\n- Grilled eel plate\nComes out with dipping sauce, ginger, and lettuce to make wraps.  Awesome flavor and perfectly cooked.  Highly recommend getting this.\n\n- Garlic and sweet spicy fried chicken\nFlavor of the sweet garlic sauce was good.  Sweet and spicy sauce was similar to the one on the rice cake skewers. The chicken is pretty big and filling. The batter is pretty fluffy which makes the chicken look massive.  \nPersonal preference here, I don't prefer fried chicken with this fluffy kind of tempura batter, wish there was less batter or a different kind, my go to standard for asian chicken wings is at SO.  But with that said, I know others like this style, and the batter/breading was done well.\n\n- Cold bibim buckwheat noodle\nFlavor was good and the sauce was nice and balanced.\nOne suggestion is that it did not come with a hard boiled egg, or a slice of meat, which I think would complete the dish.  Also the portion was pretty small for the price, especially considering that an egg or beef slices were not in the dish.\n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the restaurant especially considering it being in the outer mission area. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars, but bumped it up for location, service, and since it only just opened.\n\nDefinitely going to come back to see how it progresses, and once they get their liquor/beer/wine license. They have a nice bar setup, and hope they have some nice beers on tap (always goes good with fried chicken).", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-08-26"}]}
