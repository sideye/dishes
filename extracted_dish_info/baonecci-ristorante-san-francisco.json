I wasn't quite dissatisfied enough to give a 4, but 5 feels like a special thing reserved for my top restaurants. I would return here for good Italian food, but I wouldn't put it on my list of top San Francisco spots.\n\nEating here feels like a genuine Italian experience. Our waiter had an Italian accent and attended to us much like you would see in Europe. He kept his distance and gave us lots of time. We didn't mind it, but if you were in a hurry I could see it being troubling.\n\nThey bring out some complimentary bread to start the meal. I think it was basically pizza dough cooked as a roll. It was honestly a little boring on its own, but was good when we asked for oil and vinegar to dip it in.\n\nWe tried the bruschetta and burrata appetizers. The bruschetta was good, but nothing to write home about -- quite basic. The burrata was very delicious.\n\nI ordered the eggplant Parmesan and absolutely loved it. It was delicious. The one thing that was a little deceiving is that on the menu it is under \"pasta\" and it mentions everything being with a tagliatelle pasta. Well, the eggplant just comes alone as an eggplant stack in a baking dish with no pasta on the side. That was a little disappointing, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nThe other members of my party loved their food. Particularly notable was their \"spicy\" pasta that the waiter recommended. Everyone was very impressed with it. The fresh made noodles were stellar.\n\nWe also tried the pine nut and custard tart dessert (I would write the name if I even knew it -- it's Italian). It was mediocre. The custard was a little too sweet for my taste. I would've preferred a more subtle sweetness in a dessert focused around pine nuts.\n\nIn summary, eat here, but don't be in a hurry, and make sure you get oil and vinegar with your bread.

I added proscuitto for an additional $4. Almost too pretty to eat, the blistery, crackly crust was deliciously crunchy . I normally hate pizza crusts but these were addictingly good.

We had the Truffle Salame pizza and as soon as it came out of the kitchen, the fragrance just hits you in the face without being overwhelming (can you actually BE overwhelmed by truffle oil)? Each crunchy, crispy bite was a trip to Textured, Tasty Heaven.

Two of the waiters (which I believe were the sons in the family business), actually looked at us several times and didn't come over to greet us.  Now, like I said- this was similar to experiences we had while dining in Italy. So I'm just going to chalk it up to a difference in cultural dining norms. It definitely didn't ruin our night. Finally, the owner came over to seat us.We were a little early for our reservation, but they gave us a table anyway, which was very nice- as the place was already very crowded. \n\nI started with a cup of the **Zuppa Garfagnina**, which was a puree of cannelini beans and farro which olive oil on top. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious. Perfectly seasoned, nice consistency and served with a little bit of Italian bread for soaking up the last bite. I really enjoyed it. Hindsight is 20/20, I would have gotten the bowl and a salad instead of my main dish.\n\nFor my main dish I got the **Pesto Pasta**, the Rotini was perfectly cooked. A nice al dente. The pesto covered the pasta nicely, but wasn't served in puddles and pools, which is good for me because I don't like things over sauced. I just wasn't that impressed with the pesto itself. It tasted very fresh, and not store bought as other reviews indicate, but it was not very flavorful and fell flat. My husband on the other hand really enjoyed it and said he liked it better than the Pesto that I compare all pestos to at L'Angello de Museii In Rome. Not close for me, but I'm glad he enjoyed it as much as he did. It was by no means BAD, it just wasn't GREAT!\n\nMy husband got the Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza- **Salamino E Salsiccia** He really likes thin crust pizza, so he was impressed with the crust of the pie. It was thin, but he could still pick up a slice and everything didn't go falling off. He also noted that the cheese was very creamy and melted well, a higher quality mozzarella than was served in our regular pizza place. He's definitely not as descriptive as I am, so when I asked him how he felt about it overall, he said \"It was good.\" So good it was.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the Owner came up to talk to us and asked me how I enjoyed making our reservation on Open Table. I guess they just started using it a few weeks ago. He was really nice, and seemed really interested in how we felt about the process. \n\nI think that their business will continue to thrive. They are really nice people, making quality food. I wish them well.\n\n**Another note, the bathroom is in a hallway behind the kitchen, so you need to walk through the kitchen to get there. I was so impressed with how impeccably clean the kitchen was. Everything was neat in prep containers, and there was not a crumb on the ground. I love a clean kitchen.

I've been there at least five times, and I've been wowed each and every time.\n\nListen, first thing's first--this is Luccan fare, not Neapolitan pizza, so you can't use the Margherita as your measuring stick. That would be like ordering Chicken Tikka Masala at Saravana Bhavan, silly!\n\nHere are some things we got on our most recent visit:\n\n***TAGLIERE ANTIPASTO TOSCANO - Prosciutto Parma, Salame, Coppa, mortadella, Pecorino cheese\n\nYummy cured meats & pecorino garnished with caperberries. Hard to go wrong when you're using the freshest of ingredients. A delightful beginning.\n\n***LASAGNA - Bolognese meat sauce, parmigiano, bechamel\n\nWalter Gambaccini & son Elia separately recommended this to us, but I can't say that I was completely enthralled with their take on it, because frankly lasagna is lasagna. Each layer of dough was meaty and fresh, though and the cheese on top was noticeably artisanal. But I like gooey, moist, and light, and this was slightly dry and a bit heavy.\n\n***MONTE BIANCO - San marsano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto parma, scoop of mascarpone cheese\n\nWe're treading on sacred ground here, so please take your hat off. As simple as it sounds, this thin crust pizza is baked to a perfect crispiness, and the ingredients are just top notch. The mozzarella provides the body and texture, but it's not overwhelming, instead painfully fresh & perfectly mild, for with BaoNecci pizzas, the cheese is just a vehicle to deliver the other goodies. That prosciutto melts in your mouth with a godly level of saltiness, and that mascarpone, oh glorious mascarpone--you are as sweet, thick, & creamy as a cherub! I hereby would like to request that I be buried in a coffin filled with sweetened mascarpone (catered by BaoNecci of course).\n\n***TRUFFLE SALAME - San marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella, truffle salame, truffle oil, arugola\n\nKeep your voice down, reciting this holy script of ingredients is a religious exercise. The truffle salame is dreamily rich, the arugola provides those crucial bitter accents and leafiness, and that truffle oil, the fragrance emanating therefrom fills the entire kitchen. I could IV this liquid gold into my veins and survive on its sustenance alone! These two pizzas are BaoNecci's secret weapons--one bite and you'll be forever prostituting yourself out for another.\n\n***CANNOLI\n\nI was extremely disappointed that the Affogato Chocolate Tartufo was sold out. This is BaoNecci's signature dessert, described as chocolate in the shape of a truffle (the fungi variety) and filled with custard. So we went with the cannoli. The plating was absolutely gorgeous with a preserved cherry as garnish. The cannoli itself was solid, but was just missing something--the filling had that perfect consistency, but it wasn't quite sweet enough, and the pastry shell lacked that \"Step aside, I was just deep-fried!\" punch in the face. It was solid though. Next time that Tartufo is mine!\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nThe gods fated that I would happen upon BaoNecci--it was predestined.

I mention the pasta because Caffe Baonecci, and rightfully so, probably has the reputation as having the best pizza in the Bay Area but I wanted to tell you that the pasta is fantastic too.\n\nThe Master of the Kitchen is a native born Italian and I mention this because most Italian restaurants have Latins cooking and although trained by Italians, for me there is nothing like having a native born Italian cooking for you as she/he would for their families. They have also expanded so it is wonderful for a private party of 10-15 + and Stephania will cook dishes of your preference or she will recommend some and these are not on the menu. It's a perfect place for a Holiday party, birthday, anninversary etc. Try it, you'll like it, I promise you !!!\n\n\n\nNon posso dirvi il mio piatto preferito che Stefania fa perch\u00e9 ci sono cos\u00ec tante ed ella cuoce per voi che cosa ella si prepara per la sua famiglia Amo particolarmente le paste lunge, tagliatelle, pappardelle etc., le paste all'uovo nelle ricette di cucina italiana tradizionale toscana che si accompagna magificamente a piatti dal sapore forte come la salsa bolognese fatta come mia mamma usata per fare con carne di manzo e di maiale. Ma veramente eo divento nostalgico con suoi Fagioli all'Uccelletto con cannellini fagioli, salsa di pomodoro, aglio, salvia & salsiccia(lei aggiunge per me). La nostra famiglia era povera e questo era il nostro pasto intero con una pasta piccola come ditalli, conchiglie etc e pane e insalata. Ho citato questi piatti di pasta, perch\u00e9 Caffe Baonecci e giustamente cos\u00ec, probabilmente ha la reputazione per la migliore pizza della zona della baia, ma ho voluto assicurare persone che i piatti di pasta sono fantastici troppo.\n\nQui c'\u00e8 una maestra in cucina che \u00e8 nativa nata italiana. La maggiore parte dei ristoranti italiani hanno latini in cucina e anche se addestrati da italiani, non \u00e8 lo stesso di avere la Mamma in cucina cucinare apparentemente solo per te. Essi hanno ampliato qui e per una festa privata, 10-15 etc di pi\u00f9 persone, Stefania cuciner\u00e0 un piatto di sua preferenza o ella consiglia qualcosa fuori menu Pollo alla Cacciatora, Arrosti di Porco etc. e vi sentirete davvero come si stanno avendo cena a casa di Mamma. \u00c8 un luogo preferiscono per una festa, compleanno, anninversary etc. Provatelo, piacerete, vi lo prometto!!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-12-11"}, {"excerpts": ["The Stefania's salad was lightly dressed and very flavorful.

"], "author": "Kelly S.", "review": "It's been almost four years since I've been to Italy. I love authentic Italian pizza so much that I would take a trip to Italy just for the pizza. In the meantime, I've searched in vain for authentic Italian style pizza in the U.S. After reading many reviews in my search for a slice of Italy in the U.S., I finally came across Caffe Baonecci, and I knew I just had to try it.\n\nCaffe Baonecci is appropriately located in San Francisco's North Beach district known as Little Italy. It's a tiny speck of a restaurant hidden on the corner of the street and an alleyway, so it's easy to almost miss. Inside are only about 10 tables. The walls are covered with black and white photographs of famous Italians, including Sofia Loren and the like. A flat screen TV played contemporary Italian music videos. The tables had the traditional red and white checkered tablecloths commonly found in trattorias (a casual Italian restaurant). Though the atmosphere was casual, there were little touches of elegance, like real baby poinsettias donned by each table, and glass water carfes.\n\nPerhaps the nicest touch was not the d\u00e9cor, but our host for the evening, the proud Italian owner who is originally from Lucca. His rolling accent and humor filled the tiny space with warmth. We could hear lively Italian conversations coming from the kitchen that gave me the sense that I really could be in Italy. \n\nWe started with Stefania's Salad, which had romaine lettuce, thinly sliced apple, walnuts, and cubes of Swiss cheese, sprinkled with a light vinaigrette. I was pleased by its freshness and quality ingredients. \n\nBy the owner's recommendation, we chose the \"Monte Bianco,\" a combination of Parma ham and Mascarpone that is unique to Caffe Baonecci. The crust was perfectly thin: soft melt-in-your-mouth in the center and slightly crispy on the outside. What I love most about Italian pizza is the thin crust, so thin that you have to fold it in half like a sandwich to eat, and this is exactly how the crust is at Caf\u00e9 Baonecci. The ingredients were top-notch: San Marzano tomato sauce and Fior di latte mozzarella. True to Italian pizza, the tomato sauce was spread just thin enough, and not too acidic. It married perfectly with the fresh mozzarella, which is not oily or greasy, and the right amount of chewy. The Parma (Italian cured ham) added a little bit of saltiness. What makes this pizza truly special is the Mascarpone. The pizza arrives hot from the wood oven with a dollop of cold Mascarpone cheese in the center. (Mascarpone is a soft spreadable Italian cheese, a sweeter version of cream cheese). While the pizza is hot, spread the Mascarpone cheese over the pizza and it melts in like butter. I cannot describe in words the deliciousness of this experience in your mouth: the cool buttery Mascarpone contrasting with the warm Mozzarella and blending with the salty Parma. Truly a special pizza. I even dreamed about this pizza later that night.

Luckily they have two tables outside that don't require reservations. \n\nI had only heard about the amazing thing pizza so I didn't realize until I got there that it has other items like salads, cheeses, appetizers, pastas, lasagna, nutella pizza, and then a whole page of different pizza options. \n\nThe pizza options have two sides - like a regular pizza side and then a \"fancier\" (?) pizza side but a lot of the options sounded exactly the same but more expensive. Like they both had a mushroom pizza but one side was just more expensive. I couldn't figure out what about the ingredients made it more special. \n\nWe opted for a sausage, pepperoni pizza, and a mushroom proscuitto pizza and two peroni's to go with it. The pizzas came out pretty quick, while our beers did not. Had to reorder them so service was just ok.  The pizzas were delicious and incredibly flaky and fell apart when you hold them. Luckily, I love super thin crust pizza because then I get more toppings taste. Yum! While the toppings were average (I opted for the regular side), the thin crispy pizza dough was awesome.

I've been there at least five times, and I've been wowed each and every time.\n\nListen, first thing's first--this is Luccan fare, not Neapolitan pizza, so you can't use the Margherita as your measuring stick. That would be like ordering Chicken Tikka Masala at Saravana Bhavan, silly!\n\nHere are some things we got on our most recent visit:\n\n***TAGLIERE ANTIPASTO TOSCANO - Prosciutto Parma, Salame, Coppa, mortadella, Pecorino cheese\n\nYummy cured meats & pecorino garnished with caperberries. Hard to go wrong when you're using the freshest of ingredients. A delightful beginning.\n\n***LASAGNA - Bolognese meat sauce, parmigiano, bechamel\n\nWalter Gambaccini & son Elia separately recommended this to us, but I can't say that I was completely enthralled with their take on it, because frankly lasagna is lasagna. Each layer of dough was meaty and fresh, though and the cheese on top was noticeably artisanal. But I like gooey, moist, and light, and this was slightly dry and a bit heavy.\n\n***MONTE BIANCO - San marsano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto parma, scoop of mascarpone cheese\n\nWe're treading on sacred ground here, so please take your hat off. As simple as it sounds, this thin crust pizza is baked to a perfect crispiness, and the ingredients are just top notch. The mozzarella provides the body and texture, but it's not overwhelming, instead painfully fresh & perfectly mild, for with BaoNecci pizzas, the cheese is just a vehicle to deliver the other goodies. That prosciutto melts in your mouth with a godly level of saltiness, and that mascarpone, oh glorious mascarpone--you are as sweet, thick, & creamy as a cherub! I hereby would like to request that I be buried in a coffin filled with sweetened mascarpone (catered by BaoNecci of course).\n\n***TRUFFLE SALAME - San marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella, truffle salame, truffle oil, arugola\n\nKeep your voice down, reciting this holy script of ingredients is a religious exercise. The truffle salame is dreamily rich, the arugola provides those crucial bitter accents and leafiness, and that truffle oil, the fragrance emanating therefrom fills the entire kitchen. I could IV this liquid gold into my veins and survive on its sustenance alone! These two pizzas are BaoNecci's secret weapons--one bite and you'll be forever prostituting yourself out for another.\n\n***CANNOLI\n\nI was extremely disappointed that the Affogato Chocolate Tartufo was sold out. This is BaoNecci's signature dessert, described as chocolate in the shape of a truffle (the fungi variety) and filled with custard. So we went with the cannoli. The plating was absolutely gorgeous with a preserved cherry as garnish. The cannoli itself was solid, but was just missing something--the filling had that perfect consistency, but it wasn't quite sweet enough, and the pastry shell lacked that \"Step aside, I was just deep-fried!\" punch in the face. It was solid though. Next time that Tartufo is mine!\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nThe gods fated that I would happen upon BaoNecci--it was predestined.

My friends ordered Salamino E Salsiccia and Salsiccia e Taleggio pizzas but we all shared and agreed the Truffle Salame was the winner of the night.  The truffle flavor really made the pizza stand out from the other 2 we had.  My friends didn't like that the pizzas were so thin, although this is an Italian style, but I thought the thickness was fine, it just didn't look as appealing as other thin crust Italian style pizza I've had before. We each also ordered wine and beer.  The total for each of us was around $30 each which is a little steeper than we would've liked considering the pizzas were truly personal sized and weren't on par to what we were expecting.  I prefer Delfina in the Mission District, they have a better quality pizza (among other dishes).  \n\nService was also a little spotty, we waited at least 20 minutes to get the attention of a waiter to order.  When we turned around we saw that a party that was seated after us had already ordered and gotten a bread basket, which we never got.  When we wanted more water, again it was a challenge to get a waiter's attention.

The interior was oddly decorated with large photographs and graphic prints, but the overall impression was pleasing. There was a certain authenticity to the atmosphere, with its low lighting and feeling of fullness thanks to lively conversation and laughter filling the air. My boyfriend said it reminded him of the trattorias that he often visited while living in Rome. There was a small tea light lit on each table, lending a flickering glow. It felt quite intimate.\n\nThe server was warm and charming, and we felt at ease as we took some time considering our options. We selected a glass of Sangiovese (acidic and bright) and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, (soft and fruity), along with a quarto fromagi pizza. We decided to start small since we wanted to save room for the house-made desserts. \n\nSince moving to San Francisco, Benjamin and I have had trouble locating a place that serves thin crust pizza in the Roman style. Boanecci served us just that. The quarto fromagi was to die for! The crust was wood fired, with lovely bits of charring around the edges, and the cheese was melty and flavorful. There was a perfect swirl of rich olive oil as a base and a good amount of herbs to round out the dish. I even loved that there was a light dusting of corn meal on the crust, a testament to hand stretching and firing. My only suggestion to the cook is that they add more fresh basil to top the pizza. \n\nWe loved the pizza so much that we ordered a second, a traditional Margherita. I wasn't as pleased with this one. The mozzarella and basil were solid, but the tomato flavor of the sauce was less pronounced than I would have liked. However, we still ate it up, as the crust was so delicious. \n\nThroughout the meal, the servers and the restaurant manager checked in on us, making sure that we were taken care of without being intrusive. I felt like a family friend dining in their home. \n\nThe dessert of the day was tiramisu, so, even though we were quite full at this point, we couldn't resist. It was served in a glass dish, and had a more pudding-like quality to it, which is more traditional.

Two of the waiters (which I believe were the sons in the family business), actually looked at us several times and didn't come over to greet us.  Now, like I said- this was similar to experiences we had while dining in Italy. So I'm just going to chalk it up to a difference in cultural dining norms. It definitely didn't ruin our night. Finally, the owner came over to seat us.We were a little early for our reservation, but they gave us a table anyway, which was very nice- as the place was already very crowded. \n\nI started with a cup of the **Zuppa Garfagnina**, which was a puree of cannelini beans and farro which olive oil on top. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious. Perfectly seasoned, nice consistency and served with a little bit of Italian bread for soaking up the last bite. I really enjoyed it. Hindsight is 20/20, I would have gotten the bowl and a salad instead of my main dish.\n\nFor my main dish I got the **Pesto Pasta**, the Rotini was perfectly cooked. A nice al dente. The pesto covered the pasta nicely, but wasn't served in puddles and pools, which is good for me because I don't like things over sauced. I just wasn't that impressed with the pesto itself. It tasted very fresh, and not store bought as other reviews indicate, but it was not very flavorful and fell flat. My husband on the other hand really enjoyed it and said he liked it better than the Pesto that I compare all pestos to at L'Angello de Museii In Rome. Not close for me, but I'm glad he enjoyed it as much as he did. It was by no means BAD, it just wasn't GREAT!\n\nMy husband got the Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza- **Salamino E Salsiccia** He really likes thin crust pizza, so he was impressed with the crust of the pie. It was thin, but he could still pick up a slice and everything didn't go falling off. He also noted that the cheese was very creamy and melted well, a higher quality mozzarella than was served in our regular pizza place. He's definitely not as descriptive as I am, so when I asked him how he felt about it overall, he said \"It was good.\" So good it was.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the Owner came up to talk to us and asked me how I enjoyed making our reservation on Open Table. I guess they just started using it a few weeks ago. He was really nice, and seemed really interested in how we felt about the process. \n\nI think that their business will continue to thrive. They are really nice people, making quality food. I wish them well.\n\n**Another note, the bathroom is in a hallway behind the kitchen, so you need to walk through the kitchen to get there. I was so impressed with how impeccably clean the kitchen was. Everything was neat in prep containers, and there was not a crumb on the ground. I love a clean kitchen.

It was about 8:30 p.m. Monday night on 8/8/2011 and my wife and I along with our little baby girl thought it would be a great idea to stop by North Beach in our old haunts and grab a bite to eat before we drive back to the East Bay.   I have heard and wanted to try the pizza here at BaoNecci, so we pay for parking across the street, $11.00 and walk across the street.  \n\nBefore going inside I noticed that there were3 tables empty outside and inside about 2 tables left and the rest are filled with patrons eating their tasty looking pizzas.  Also we wanted to go somewhere cozy where it was nice and warm because it was a bit chilly outside.  So my wife goes inside and says can we get a table for 4, because we are waiting for a couple of friends who were about 10 minutes away.  The waiter or host goes to the back by the register talks to whoever that was behind it comes back and says ok and then proceeds to ask, is the other party here yet? Obviously no, but told them they should be here shortly.  Well he said, since we don't do reservations, we will seat you once they get here. \n\n WHOAAAAAAAAAA..PUT ON THE BRAKES!! I looked around the restaurant, sure didn't look like the French Laundry, nor Boulevards,  nor any 4 or 5 star restaurants that I have been to here in the states or overseas.   It is 8:30 p.m., its cold outside., the restaurant is not full, no one was waiting and sure didn't see a crowd trying to make their way in.  Plus we have a baby in our arms.  The right thing to say was, oh since they are on the way have a seat, let me tell you about the wines or beers that we serve (hint hint $$$$) you shouldn't go back outside in the cold with your baby, AND YES WE WOULD LIKE YOUR BUSINESS AT 8:30 P.M..\n\nSo who am I? Well I am not a food critic or a food snob, but I am a patron to the city of San Francisco and its hole in the walls to fine establishments.  But I do have 28 years of restaurant experience and grew up in one, since my mother and father owns one of the oldest restaurants in Sonoma County.  I spend very good money and have a very large circle of friends that we like to recommend eating establishments to and basically have had it all.  \n\nWe have never been so rudely treated and walked away with a bitter taste in our mouths.  I am sure I will end up trying this pizza place, but really in no hurry anymore, if they are still around.  So to the owners or restaurant employees, please learn some etiquette when it comes to dealing with customer's and please don't give me \"OH everyone needs to be here to be seated\".

Their pizza is AMAZING. Hands down the best pizza I've had in the Bay Area.  But, I was also on the receiving end on some of the worst service EVER on my last visit.  I've been here for lunch and enjoyed the pizza & service, but when I came for dinner last Saturday night I was kind of appalled.\n\nBut, let's start with the good stuff- THE PIZZA.  They make amazing, crispy thin crust pizza.  On my last visit we had the prosciutto and arugala pizza and the gorgonzola and pear pizza.  They were both fantastic.  The pear pizza gets extra points for looking super cool as well - they take fresh curly strips of pear and throw them on the pizza after it comes out of the oven.  I wasn't 100% sold on gorgonzola on pizza before I had this, but the flavor was great and not too overpowering.\n\nNow on to the bad stuff. First, it took them much longer to seat us than was quoted - not a big deal, happens all the time.  The first strike was after they seated us, we were ignored for at least 15 minutes.  So 30 minutes waiting outside + 15 minutes waiting at the table (totally ready to order - had to entertain ourselves outside somehow) = three hungry ladies.  We finally get to order and asked for the cheese plate plus the two pizzas I mentioned above.  Cheese plate comes out and is delicious - there were 4 kinds of cheese + jam + honey and bread.  We ran out of bread with about half the cheese left so we asked for more.  Instead of getting another serving of bread the size of what we had already eaten, we got about half that.  Really?? I'm pretty sure they give bread out for free to people who don't get the cheese platter so it seems pretty absurd to skimp on that.  We again ran out of bread but just sucked it up and finished the cheese.  Next came the pizzas... and by pizzas I mean pizza.  They brought out one of the pizzas we ordered and some other pizza we didn't order.  When we told them the second one wasn't what we ordered, they took back BOTH pies.  About two minutes later they came back out with the one correct pie.  We ate that (again DELICIOUS) and the second pie came out a few minutes later.  Again, this wouldn't have been a big deal if it had been the one thing that went wrong.\n\nWell, now I have officially gone on a Yelp rant, but as you can see I still gave them four stars.

This is super thin crust pizza which is what you would expect to find in Naples, or Rome, or Florence.  The ingredients are insanely good which really makes this pizza.\n\nI had the proscuitto, mascapone (best marscapone I've ever eaten), and mozzerella, with san marzano tomato sauce.  Unbelievable.  The marscapone nearly made me pass out.  There is something about watching cold, creamy, marscapone melt over a hot, fresh out of the oven pizza pie.  I'd never had it like that, but oh my god, I would have smeared it all over my body before being licked to death by a thousand stray cats.  \n\nThe place had just closed when we got there, but thankfully the owners were willing to throw a couple more pies into the oven for us after we told them we had come all the way from San Diego for their pizza.

I had no problem getting a table for 4 people at 7:00PM on a Friday evening. \n- The Baonecci Monte Bianco pizza was somewhat on the light side. The mascarpone cheese is kind of dolloped in the middle so you don't really get that much of it. It adds a creamy note to the pizza. The pizza was very light and I was expecting something more flavorful because it is named after the establishment. \n- The California Pepperoni pizza (my friends wanted it okay) was surprisingly good. The salami on top was delicious and the pizza had more sauce on it, similar to American style pizza (but not THAT much sauce).\n- The service is very friendly. You feel like you stepped into someone's kitchen as opposed to a restaurant.\n\nJUST OKAY:\n- You have to walk through their kitchen to get to the restroom. Some people might be turned off by that but I thought it was cool to see the kitchen.\n- The pizzas are not that cheap ($11-16) if you are hungry. The pizzas are super thin crust so if you are starving, one pizza is enough for only one person. \n- The decor is minimal and bare. It might be too casual for a first date but if you don't care about decor, don't worry about it.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n- BaoNecci is a nice gem in North Beach. It is easy to walk past this place without noticing its existence because it looks more like a bakery than a sit-down place to eat. However, if you are looking for some lighter Italian-style pizza that is not loaded with cheese and sauce like American pizza, this is the place.

Others in our group decided to go with some apps as well which were incredibly mediocre and over priced (eggplant parm and Toscano each over $20 with again a small portion size). Their beers are reasonably priced, however upon looking at the Italian beers (Yes, I know they are known for wine not beer) I decided on a $6 Anchor instead.\n\nService:\n\nHard to believe after what was mentioned above, that it could possibly get any worse, but it did.

The pizzas had the most beautiful thin crust that was near cracker thin and the top, with the appropriate chew in the pizza body.   The salad was equally nice. \n\nThe chianti, exactly what you hope for based on the description .... it was rich, approachable, the right acidity and balance to make it a family table wine.  I resisted ordering another glass, but will search out a bottle. \n\nThe setting- it's the storybook family restaurant.

Overall the size portion wasn't that bad, but the sauce that came with the calzone was mediocre at best with no taste or flavor. \n\nA few others ordered some pastas among other things.

Others in our group decided to go with some apps as well which were incredibly mediocre and over priced (eggplant parm and Toscano each over $20 with again a small portion size). Their beers are reasonably priced, however upon looking at the Italian beers (Yes, I know they are known for wine not beer) I decided on a $6 Anchor instead.\n\nService:\n\nHard to believe after what was mentioned above, that it could possibly get any worse, but it did. The server didn't hand us a menu and came to check on us 30 minutes after we had arrived. All of us starving by that point, didn't let him run away so we orders beers, water, apps right away. Then we waited almost another 25 minutes before we ordered our entrees. I guess eye contact doesn't go a long way towards saying, \"Help me! I am hungry.\" Then the finale of getting the check was absolutely terrible. A bus boy cleared our table and we still waited close to 45 more minutes to get our check. The entire ordeal took about 2 1/2 hours! No wonder these guys are packed all the time.\n\nOverall:\n\nI won't go back, not a chance.

As simple as it sounds, this thin crust pizza is baked to a perfect crispiness, and the ingredients are just top notch. The mozzarella provides the body and texture, but it's not overwhelming, instead painfully fresh & perfectly mild, for with BaoNecci pizzas, the cheese is just a vehicle to deliver the other goodies. That prosciutto melts in your mouth with a godly level of saltiness, and that mascarpone, oh glorious mascarpone--you are as sweet, thick, & creamy as a cherub! I hereby would like to request that I be buried in a coffin filled with sweetened mascarpone (catered by BaoNecci of course).\n\n***TRUFFLE SALAME - San marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella, truffle salame, truffle oil, arugola\n\nKeep your voice down, reciting this holy script of ingredients is a religious exercise. The truffle salame is dreamily rich, the arugola provides those crucial bitter accents and leafiness, and that truffle oil, the fragrance emanating therefrom fills the entire kitchen. I could IV this liquid gold into my veins and survive on its sustenance alone! These two pizzas are BaoNecci's secret weapons--one bite and you'll be forever prostituting yourself out for another.\n\n***CANNOLI\n\nI was extremely disappointed that the Affogato Chocolate Tartufo was sold out. This is BaoNecci's signature dessert, described as chocolate in the shape of a truffle (the fungi variety) and filled with custard. So we went with the cannoli. The plating was absolutely gorgeous with a preserved cherry as garnish. The cannoli itself was solid, but was just missing something--the filling had that perfect consistency, but it wasn't quite sweet enough, and the pastry shell lacked that \"Step aside, I was just deep-fried!\" punch in the face. It was solid though. Next time that Tartufo is mine!\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nThe gods fated that I would happen upon BaoNecci--it was predestined.

For those on Facebook, go to their site & see the inviting restaurant environment, photos of their family & friends(many in Italia) & some of the most delicious dishes prepared by Stefania !!!\n\nI can't tell you my favorite plate made by Stephania because there are so many and she cooks for you as she does for her family. I really like her handmade long pastas, Tagliattelle, Pappardelle etc. made with eggs and from traditional Tuscan menus which accompany savory sauces like her Bolognese made like my Mamma did both with beef and pork. Also, I get very nostalgic with the Fagioli all'Uccelletto with cannellini beans, tomato sause, garlic, sage and sausage ( she adds this for me). I mention the pasta because Caffe Baonecci, and rightfully so, probably has the reputation as having the best pizza in the Bay Area but I wanted to tell you that the pasta is fantastic too.\n\nThe Master of the Kitchen is a native born Italian and I mention this because most Italian restaurants have Latins cooking and although trained by Italians, for me there is nothing like having a native born Italian cooking for you as she/he would for their families. They have also expanded so it is wonderful for a private party of 10-15 + and Stephania will cook dishes of your preference or she will recommend some and these are not on the menu.

Hard to go wrong when you're using the freshest of ingredients. A delightful beginning.\n\n***LASAGNA - Bolognese meat sauce, parmigiano, bechamel\n\nWalter Gambaccini & son Elia separately recommended this to us, but I can't say that I was completely enthralled with their take on it, because frankly lasagna is lasagna. Each layer of dough was meaty and fresh, though and the cheese on top was noticeably artisanal.

As simple as it sounds, this thin crust pizza is baked to a perfect crispiness, and the ingredients are just top notch. The mozzarella provides the body and texture, but it's not overwhelming, instead painfully fresh & perfectly mild, for with BaoNecci pizzas, the cheese is just a vehicle to deliver the other goodies. That prosciutto melts in your mouth with a godly level of saltiness, and that mascarpone, oh glorious mascarpone--you are as sweet, thick, & creamy as a cherub! I hereby would like to request that I be buried in a coffin filled with sweetened mascarpone (catered by BaoNecci of course).\n\n***TRUFFLE SALAME - San marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella, truffle salame, truffle oil, arugola\n\nKeep your voice down, reciting this holy script of ingredients is a religious exercise. The truffle salame is dreamily rich, the arugola provides those crucial bitter accents and leafiness, and that truffle oil, the fragrance emanating therefrom fills the entire kitchen. I could IV this liquid gold into my veins and survive on its sustenance alone! These two pizzas are BaoNecci's secret weapons--one bite and you'll be forever prostituting yourself out for another.\n\n***CANNOLI\n\nI was extremely disappointed that the Affogato Chocolate Tartufo was sold out. This is BaoNecci's signature dessert, described as chocolate in the shape of a truffle (the fungi variety) and filled with custard. So we went with the cannoli. The plating was absolutely gorgeous with a preserved cherry as garnish. The cannoli itself was solid, but was just missing something--the filling had that perfect consistency, but it wasn't quite sweet enough, and the pastry shell lacked that \"Step aside, I was just deep-fried!\" punch in the face. It was solid though. Next time that Tartufo is mine!\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nThe gods fated that I would happen upon BaoNecci--it was predestined.

The wait at Tony's was 2 hours and the line for Golden Boy was out the door, so we decided to call BaoNecci's to see how long their wait was.

I love authentic Italian pizza so much that I would take a trip to Italy just for the pizza. In the meantime, I've searched in vain for authentic Italian style pizza in the U.S. After reading many reviews in my search for a slice of Italy in the U.S., I finally came across Caffe Baonecci, and I knew I just had to try it.\n\nCaffe Baonecci is appropriately located in San Francisco's North Beach district known as Little Italy. It's a tiny speck of a restaurant hidden on the corner of the street and an alleyway, so it's easy to almost miss. Inside are only about 10 tables. The walls are covered with black and white photographs of famous Italians, including Sofia Loren and the like. A flat screen TV played contemporary Italian music videos. The tables had the traditional red and white checkered tablecloths commonly found in trattorias (a casual Italian restaurant). Though the atmosphere was casual, there were little touches of elegance, like real baby poinsettias donned by each table, and glass water carfes.\n\nPerhaps the nicest touch was not the d\u00e9cor, but our host for the evening, the proud Italian owner who is originally from Lucca. His rolling accent and humor filled the tiny space with warmth. We could hear lively Italian conversations coming from the kitchen that gave me the sense that I really could be in Italy. \n\nWe started with Stefania's Salad, which had romaine lettuce, thinly sliced apple, walnuts, and cubes of Swiss cheese, sprinkled with a light vinaigrette. I was pleased by its freshness and quality ingredients. \n\nBy the owner's recommendation, we chose the \"Monte Bianco,\" a combination of Parma ham and Mascarpone that is unique to Caffe Baonecci. The crust was perfectly thin: soft melt-in-your-mouth in the center and slightly crispy on the outside. What I love most about Italian pizza is the thin crust, so thin that you have to fold it in half like a sandwich to eat, and this is exactly how the crust is at Caf\u00e9 Baonecci. The ingredients were top-notch: San Marzano tomato sauce and Fior di latte mozzarella. True to Italian pizza, the tomato sauce was spread just thin enough, and not too acidic. It married perfectly with the fresh mozzarella, which is not oily or greasy, and the right amount of chewy. The Parma (Italian cured ham) added a little bit of saltiness. What makes this pizza truly special is the Mascarpone. The pizza arrives hot from the wood oven with a dollop of cold Mascarpone cheese in the center. (Mascarpone is a soft spreadable Italian cheese, a sweeter version of cream cheese). While the pizza is hot, spread the Mascarpone cheese over the pizza and it melts in like butter. I cannot describe in words the deliciousness of this experience in your mouth: the cool buttery Mascarpone contrasting with the warm Mozzarella and blending with the salty Parma. Truly a special pizza. I even dreamed about this pizza later that night. That's how good it is.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-01-30"}, {"excerpts": ["- The Baonecci Monte Bianco pizza was somewhat on the light side.

Some people might be turned off by that but I thought it was cool to see the kitchen.\n- The pizzas are not that cheap ($11-16) if you are hungry. The pizzas are super thin crust so if you are starving, one pizza is enough for only one person. \n- The decor is minimal and bare. It might be too casual for a first date but if you don't care about decor, don't worry about it.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n- BaoNecci is a nice gem in North Beach. It is easy to walk past this place without noticing its existence because it looks more like a bakery than a sit-down place to eat. However, if you are looking for some lighter Italian-style pizza that is not loaded with cheese and sauce like American pizza, this is the place.

Between 4 people we got 3 pizzas and bruschetta and were still a bit hungry, pizzas were expensive (~$19) but comparable in price and style to Deflina. I would recommend trying Baonecci at least once because they were good and unlike anything I've had in San Francisco.\n\nIf you pay a visit, get the Truffle Salame, which was hands down the table favorite, or the Porcini which was a close second.
