"], "author": "Michael C.", "review": "My roommate, a local, raves about this place and had gotten it the night before. He proclaimed it was the only burrito in the city he couldn't finish in one sitting and to get the verde.\n\nNow I was aware of the place as I have to go to the Post Office on Onondaga twice a month. Wait... *runs down to get the mail and sees another missed you slip* Make that three times a month! The place is at the corner of one of the most delicious intersections on Mission, across the street an El Farrolito, a Hawaiian Drive Inn, and TY Sandwiches. Easily one of the hardest decisions to make. But my roommate got me hyped.\n\nYou walk into a place that looks like it could be at a Disney knockoff, with an interior that makes it look like you are actually in an exterior Mexican neighborhood with windows, lights, and paintings. I LOVE restaurants like this, or bars like Smuggler's Cove. That alone gives this place 3 stars. \n\nNow if picking this place out of the corner wasn't difficult, now comes the next hard part - figuring what to eat. Between giant burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and nachos, it's a difficult decision. This was my first time, and while a complete sucker for a super shrimp quesadilla, and my roommate raving about the burrito, I didn't know how their meat was. So I went for the easier option of 3 tacos - one cabeza, one carnitas, and one pastor.\n\nI got a basket of chips while I waited, and as others have mentioned these chips alone are some of the best. Thick and crispy, these aren't the thin greasy things you get at other taquerias. I should have gotten more. They also have a sauce and salsa bar. The verde is solid, the orange will kick your ass, and I think there was a red.\n\nOf the meats, the cabeza was the weakest. And I love cabeza. The carnitas was excellent, perfectly fried and tasty. But the pastor stole the show. Full of flavor, made with bits of pineapple, I have no problem knowing I'm getting a pastor burrito next time I come. I even tried to scoop as much sauce with my chips as possible. I am glad I saved this taco for last. I also had a tamarind jarritos to wash it all down. Que Delicioso!\n\nAffordable, quick, great interior, nice staff, and delicious food. I know I'm walking to the post office tomorrow, but I have no idea what to eat.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-01-29"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the super shrimp quesadilla and i must say every bite was a party in my mouth ", "LOL.

I couldn't taste the rice, but I did pick up a good taste of the steak. It wasn't too bad. Now the thing with this place is that they have the steak all precooked and ready to go, and then they throw it back on the griddle to reheat. I know this because I witnessed from behind the counter. At EF, they're constantly grilling meats, so the meat in your meal is freshly grilled, not reheated. \n\nOverall, the taste was pretty satisfying as I had been craving a REAL burrito for some time now. Quesadillas are definitely better at EF, and the burrito is decent. Not the best, but I think I can say it's as good as the EF across the street on a good day. \n\nPrices are a bit more than EF too, a good 50-75 cents more.

The burrito is always juicy, seasoned well and the pieces of avocado (present in a lot of their dishes) is a nice touch. The portions are big.

I ordered a breakfast burrito, the tall head waitress lady turns to the cook, asked if he's willing to make it, he shook his head and the lady denied my order.

She's really ok, she really is. She'll be friendly at times and not others. When it gets busy, she does the thing where she starts taking orders from the person after you while STILL tending to you. One particular instance: she started tending to the next customer while refusing to give me change until I asked 1min later, then which she promptly put me in my place with some sharp words. I've come here enough times and she's consistently friendly with me now, no biggie. The morning and afternoon waitress is such a dear though. \n\n3. Some more random thoughts: I've come here around 5:30 and I've stood in front of the counter for a full ten minutes while the waitresses were counting all the money in the register without saying ANYTHING to me (no hi, sorry, nothing). Probably tallying the early shift's transactions. Also, during the non-busy hours, don't be surprised to come to an empty counter and wait a few minutes before a waitress shows up to take your order while she's tending to other stuff in the back (slightly understaffed?). \n\nAll these issues are minor and will probably be encountered by someone who come here pretty often.

Because the city, specifically San Francisco's Mission Street, is a gold mine for one of the best Taquerias in the Bay Area. On many people's lists, you will find three different places that sell \"life-changing\" food: El Farolito, La Taqueria, and Taqueria Guadalajara. \n\nDue to all the hype, I've actually had El Farolito more times than I can remember; I can honestly say that their Super Quesadilla (Suiza), in combination with their green sauce, is one of the most amazing things you will ever have in your life. To this day, I haven't found a place that does it better. And La Taqueria, has there ever been a place that's attracted SO MANY PEOPLE? According to like everyone, including myself, this place truly does have THE best, if not one of the best carne asada burritos (https://fivethirtyeight.com/burrito/#brackets-view).\n\nBut Taqueria Guadalajara, the third of the trio, I haven't had the chance you eat you up yet...until recently when my girlfriend totally read my mind and decided that we were going to come here! In San Francisco, there are at least two Taqueria Guadalajaras, both ironically on Mission Street. We ended up going to the more popular one in Excelsior as it was closer to us.\n\nThis Taqueria Guadalajara is located right in between Russia and France Avenue on 4798 Mission Street. If you think the names of the streets are awesome, check out what's right across from Guadalajara: El Farolito! That's definitely bold on either end to have your main competitor RIGHT next to you. For parking, traffic may be so-so depending on when you come. We drove in around 12pm on a Sunday and we were able to find a spot on the street after circling once. Unfortunately, you probably will have to pay for parking, but it shouldn't be more than $2 for an hour. I do recommend coming earlier because the place does get packed. We had to wait when we got in, BUT there's plenty of tables so MAJOR PLUS compared to El Farolito at certain times (especially the 16th and Mission one).\n\nIn terms of the menu, Taqueria Guadalajara is your standard Mexican restaurant. This place will have several different options for burritos, tacos, and your favorite quesadillas. Their meats are also standard, with your steak, tripe, etc. They also have horchata too if you are into that. Their pricing is pretty competitive with others. For example, it's like about $10 for a super burrito/quesadilla which is probably what I remembered paying at La Taqueria/El Farolito. My girlfriend and I ended up getting a medium horchata, a super quesadilla, and a super burrito (both with steak). Food came out pretty fast, and here's what we thought...\n\n-Super Quesadilla (8/10). When eating the Super Suiza, I unfortunately already had a preconceived idea that El Farolito's version would be unmatched. However, I actually thought that Gaudalajara's was REALLY GOOD. The steak was cooked extremely well, the quality of the other ingredients were great, and I loved that you do get a large amount of cream cheese. The only real downsides (compared to El Farolito) was that the quesadilla could have had a bit more crunch + this place really needed better side-sauces to boost the appeal of the Suiza. For example, the basic tomato salsa was pretty poor quality (I wouldn't touch this), and they didn't have the green tomatillo sauce!!! However, I would never mind getting this again. In regards to the Super Burrito, my girlfriend loved it as well.\n\n-Horchata (7/10). This place serves your standard horchata. There's nothing really special about it, but it did the trick. It was sweet and served cold!\n\nOverall, would I say that Taqueria Guadalajara reins supreme? Nope, I'm slightly (over) loyal to El Farolito. However, I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was GREAT, there's lots of room to eat even though the place is small/there's a steady line of people, and the food was pretty delicious.

I took to my Yelp app and looked what was highly rated and still open, as it was getting near 1am.

The taqueria has a small dining area and displays its menu right behind the register and kitchen area.\n\nThe menu has all your standard Mexican fare, including: dinner plates, burriots, tortas, and tacos. As a Mexican-American, I have authentic Mexican at home on a daily basis, so I'm a tough critic at taquerias. My usual taste test consists of trying a variety of tacos or a taco-dinner plate. I went with three regular tacos: a carne asada, a pollo asado, and al pastor. The total came to less than $9 with my diet coke. I forked over the cash and was given chips and directed to the salsa bar.\n\nThe salsa bar has a bit of selection with four or five fresh salsas, as well as fresh cilantro, limes, jalapenos, etc. I tried a few of the salsas, but fell in love with one in particular. Moments later my tacos were brought to my table and they looked great, as they didn't appear greasy and the meat looked of high-quality while portion size was just right.\n\nI took my first few bites and the food was delicious and rivaled that of a Mexican backyard party. The carne was tender, juicy, and flavorful, most notably the carne asada and al pastor.

I called them because it was not what i had ordered. The lady who picked up checks my order and says she misunderstood me for a regular grilled chicken burrito instead of the super burrito with regular chicken and that she charged me for a regular burrito. She also says that it was my fault for not saying \"boiled chicken\" and saying \"regular chicken\". I told her no where on the menu under the meat choice category says boiled chicken. It was either grilled or regular. She was basically arguing with me on the phone saying it was my fault  and at the end she apologizes and hangs up.

The interesting thing is that it also comes with 3 Thick (diameter of my thumb) MUTANT sized grilled green scallions(at least 8 inches each) on top of the meat.  I guess you are supposed to somehow eat the scallions with the steak.  I experimented with wrapping a tortilla with the monster scallion and a slice of the steak with avocado and green salsa.  Not too bad, it tasted similar to the Yakitori style skewered chicken with scallion in Japan. Next tried cutting the steak with the plastic knife they have, the results were good since the steaks are kind of thin.  The mutant scallions, however were impossible to cut with the plastic utensil.  The taste is also good eating it individually, however I think wrapping it all in a tortilla tasted better somehow.  \n\nI thought this place is very nice, the service is friendlier than the mission district I think.

"], "author": "Jonathan L.", "review": "This is an official review of both Guadalajara and El Farolitos.\n\nAll I've read from Guadalajara reviews is \"El Farolitos sucks!\" and vice versa from El Farlitos reviews about Guadalajara. This honestly didn't give me an opinion on which is better. So without trying either before, I went into El Farolitos bought 1 carnitas super burrito with everything and 1 ceviche. Then walked to Guadalajara and bought the same thing except with a steak burrito instead. I also got nachos from Guadalajara because there was consensus that the nachos here were better. \n\nWhen I got home I put the burritos next to each other to see which was bigger. El Farolitos is about an inch longer and both were about the width (insert penis joke here). \n\nI cut both in half and El Farolitos burrito was definitely more juicy because I think they add more cheese or something. However, Guadalajara's burrito had large chunks of   avocado and the steak was really flavorful and delicious. If I had to choose which was better, I have to choose El Farolitos however but Guadalajara is definitely a very very close second. \n\nNext is the ceviche. I have to say that Guadalajara absolutely destroys El Farolitos. Guadalajara's was really fresh and the shrimp and fish were crunchy and not fishy tasting at all. The El Farolitos was soft and tasted old and fishy. \n\nThe Nacho's at Guadalahara was also really good. I got chicken on it just so I could have all three types of meat. Guadalahara really knows how to cook their chicken and steak. Super delicious. I kind of wish they offered the crappy nacho cheese however because it makes the chips a lot easier to eat but i guess that doesn't make the nachos authentic then. \n\nFinally, a review of the salsa bar. Both salsa's were delicious but Guadalajara had much more variety. They also had this orange habanero salsa that was ridiculously spicy. My sister loved it but I just dipped the corner of a chip into the salsa and started coughing. \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with either taqueria. Both are high quality and you would never regret going to one over the other. Both burritos were one of the top I've ever had. It all depends which type you like. More avocados and guacamole = guadalajara and more sauce and more cheese = El Farolitos. Ceviche, is clearly won by guadalajara. Finally service at both was really good. The guy at El Farolitos didn't talk to me as much but the lady at Guadalajara was really nice and tried to explain what certain things on the menu was.

Though the regular burrito comes with no sour cream, I told the cashier no sour cream just in case. I repeated my order again to ensure the cashier noted no sour cream. \n\nWhen I got home and cut into the burrito, what do ya know, there was...SOUR CREAM AGAIN!

But their salsas are terrific.  Oh, one other wonderful thing:  they are open to 4am -- yes, 4AM -- on Fri/Sat, and 1am on other days, except I think Midnight on Sundays.   The times listed above, which all end at 1am, are not correct (owners: please correct!).  They also have a location on 24th Street near Mission or South Van Ness, just as good, just as friendly staff, so they definitely got a good thing going.

Wait... *runs down to get the mail and sees another missed you slip* Make that three times a month! The place is at the corner of one of the most delicious intersections on Mission, across the street an El Farrolito, a Hawaiian Drive Inn, and TY Sandwiches.

I LOVE restaurants like this, or bars like Smuggler's Cove. That alone gives this place 3 stars. \n\nNow if picking this place out of the corner wasn't difficult, now comes the next hard part - figuring what to eat. Between giant burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and nachos, it's a difficult decision.

"], "author": "Bryan W.", "review": "If you are in San Francisco and craving Mexican food (particularly tacos, burritos, or quesadillas), you are truly, truly blessed. Because the city, specifically San Francisco's Mission Street, is a gold mine for one of the best Taquerias in the Bay Area. On many people's lists, you will find three different places that sell \"life-changing\" food: El Farolito, La Taqueria, and Taqueria Guadalajara. \n\nDue to all the hype, I've actually had El Farolito more times than I can remember; I can honestly say that their Super Quesadilla (Suiza), in combination with their green sauce, is one of the most amazing things you will ever have in your life. To this day, I haven't found a place that does it better. And La Taqueria, has there ever been a place that's attracted SO MANY PEOPLE? According to like everyone, including myself, this place truly does have THE best, if not one of the best carne asada burritos (https://fivethirtyeight.com/burrito/#brackets-view).\n\nBut Taqueria Guadalajara, the third of the trio, I haven't had the chance you eat you up yet...until recently when my girlfriend totally read my mind and decided that we were going to come here! In San Francisco, there are at least two Taqueria Guadalajaras, both ironically on Mission Street. We ended up going to the more popular one in Excelsior as it was closer to us.\n\nThis Taqueria Guadalajara is located right in between Russia and France Avenue on 4798 Mission Street. If you think the names of the streets are awesome, check out what's right across from Guadalajara: El Farolito! That's definitely bold on either end to have your main competitor RIGHT next to you. For parking, traffic may be so-so depending on when you come. We drove in around 12pm on a Sunday and we were able to find a spot on the street after circling once. Unfortunately, you probably will have to pay for parking, but it shouldn't be more than $2 for an hour. I do recommend coming earlier because the place does get packed. We had to wait when we got in, BUT there's plenty of tables so MAJOR PLUS compared to El Farolito at certain times (especially the 16th and Mission one).\n\nIn terms of the menu, Taqueria Guadalajara is your standard Mexican restaurant. This place will have several different options for burritos, tacos, and your favorite quesadillas. Their meats are also standard, with your steak, tripe, etc. They also have horchata too if you are into that. Their pricing is pretty competitive with others. For example, it's like about $10 for a super burrito/quesadilla which is probably what I remembered paying at La Taqueria/El Farolito. My girlfriend and I ended up getting a medium horchata, a super quesadilla, and a super burrito (both with steak). Food came out pretty fast, and here's what we thought...\n\n-Super Quesadilla (8/10). When eating the Super Suiza, I unfortunately already had a preconceived idea that El Farolito's version would be unmatched. However, I actually thought that Gaudalajara's was REALLY GOOD. The steak was cooked extremely well, the quality of the other ingredients were great, and I loved that you do get a large amount of cream cheese. The only real downsides (compared to El Farolito) was that the quesadilla could have had a bit more crunch + this place really needed better side-sauces to boost the appeal of the Suiza. For example, the basic tomato salsa was pretty poor quality (I wouldn't touch this), and they didn't have the green tomatillo sauce!!! However, I would never mind getting this again. In regards to the Super Burrito, my girlfriend loved it as well.\n\n-Horchata (7/10). This place serves your standard horchata. There's nothing really special about it, but it did the trick. It was sweet and served cold!\n\nOverall, would I say that Taqueria Guadalajara reins supreme? Nope, I'm slightly (over) loyal to El Farolito. However, I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was GREAT, there's lots of room to eat even though the place is small/there's a steady line of people, and the food was pretty delicious. I have to give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating.

I know for sure its not $4 more just to add avocado, plus I wasn't getting everything a super burrito comes with. Basically she was overcharging me for a regular burrito. I didn't want to argue with her and ending up paying $11 for a steak burrito with  1 slice of avocado, no rice or salsa. No thanks.

Steak was good, they slice it up in bite size pieces instead of the cubed ones I've had before. This made a difference in soaking up the other flavors IMO. \n\nGuess what else?

This honestly didn't give me an opinion on which is better. So without trying either before, I went into El Farolitos bought 1 carnitas super burrito with everything and 1 ceviche. Then walked to Guadalajara and bought the same thing except with a steak burrito instead. I also got nachos from Guadalajara because there was consensus that the nachos here were better. \n\nWhen I got home I put the burritos next to each other to see which was bigger. El Farolitos is about an inch longer and both were about the width (insert penis joke here). \n\nI cut both in half and El Farolitos burrito was definitely more juicy because I think they add more cheese or something. However, Guadalajara's burrito had large chunks of   avocado and the steak was really flavorful and delicious. If I had to choose which was better, I have to choose El Farolitos however but Guadalajara is definitely a very very close second. \n\nNext is the ceviche. I have to say that Guadalajara absolutely destroys El Farolitos. Guadalajara's was really fresh and the shrimp and fish were crunchy and not fishy tasting at all. The El Farolitos was soft and tasted old and fishy. \n\nThe Nacho's at Guadalahara was also really good. I got chicken on it just so I could have all three types of meat. Guadalahara really knows how to cook their chicken and steak. Super delicious. I kind of wish they offered the crappy nacho cheese however because it makes the chips a lot easier to eat but i guess that doesn't make the nachos authentic then. \n\nFinally, a review of the salsa bar. Both salsa's were delicious but Guadalajara had much more variety. They also had this orange habanero salsa that was ridiculously spicy. My sister loved it but I just dipped the corner of a chip into the salsa and started coughing. \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with either taqueria. Both are high quality and you would never regret going to one over the other. Both burritos were one of the top I've ever had. It all depends which type you like. More avocados and guacamole = guadalajara and more sauce and more cheese = El Farolitos. Ceviche, is clearly won by guadalajara. Finally service at both was really good.

So, in my conclusion.. this taqueria has too many A's in their name!\n\nYour regular tacos at TG (not even going to attempt typing Guada--) go for $2.40, which includes your choice of meat, onions, cilantro, and hot sauce.

I would give it a 4 but let me explain. \n\nFirst off - the food is delicious. I usually get a super burrito with steak and \"everything.\" I've also tried the super quesadilla and nachos. The burrito is always juicy, seasoned well and the pieces of avocado (present in a lot of their dishes) is a nice touch. The portions are big. If you include the free tortilla chips, you can feed a small village. The salsa bar is loaded with choices and the fresh tomato salsa is DELICIOUS. \n\nSo why the relatively low rating for great food? Because there's always something happening that prevents a smooth experience here for me. This is a burrito joint, establishments that I associate with - get in, order what I want, get out, quickly drive 3 minutes home, hide in my man cave and devour everything. \n\n 1. They will only cook you the full menu IF they're in the mood. I have different cravings at times. When I'm fully shitfaced after a good drinking sesh, I really crave a breakfast burrito (chorizo + eggs). However, they'll serve it to you sometimes and not others. I've tried ordering it in the morning - \"no chorizo.\" I've successfully ordered at night but one instance particularly stood out. I ordered a breakfast burrito, the tall head waitress lady turns to the cook, asked if he's willing to make it, he shook his head and the lady denied my order. Probably \"no chorizo\" is a better response. Oh, you'll also hear \"no tripe\" from time to time too. \n\n2. Ohhhhh the tall head waitress lady who works the afternoon/night/grave shift. She's really ok, she really is. She'll be friendly at times and not others. When it gets busy, she does the thing where she starts taking orders from the person after you while STILL tending to you. One particular instance: she started tending to the next customer while refusing to give me change until I asked 1min later, then which she promptly put me in my place with some sharp words. I've come here enough times and she's consistently friendly with me now, no biggie. The morning and afternoon waitress is such a dear though. \n\n3. Some more random thoughts: I've come here around 5:30 and I've stood in front of the counter for a full ten minutes while the waitresses were counting all the money in the register without saying ANYTHING to me (no hi, sorry, nothing). Probably tallying the early shift's transactions. Also, during the non-busy hours, don't be surprised to come to an empty counter and wait a few minutes before a waitress shows up to take your order while she's tending to other stuff in the back (slightly understaffed?). \n\nAll these issues are minor and will probably be encountered by someone who come here pretty often. But if it happens enough times when I'm just expecting a smooth \"take out and pig out,\" gets a bit annoying. \n\nLast note: this place is packed with drunk people on Fri and Sat after midnight.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-07-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Steak Burrito and Pastor Burrito\n\n\n", "I am a huge super steak ", "burrito advocate ", "but if you don't try the pastor here you are missing out on life.

The one across the street from this place has always been hit or miss. \n\nUpon entering this place, I realized how much smaller it was compared to El Farolito across the street, and how emptier it was. I was kind of worried from the get-go. \n\nI ordered the usual: Super burrito with carne asada, and the gf had her usual, super quesadilla suiza with carne asada as well. \n\nWe pillaged their salsa bar while the cook was making our stuff. \n\nWhen we got in the car, there wasn't that customary waft of suffocating goodness that we get from EF, but nonetheless I drove home eager to rip off that foil shell and into the goodies. \n\nThe first bite, I kind of just sat there with the food lingering in my mouth, trying to absorb and recognize all the flavors. I couldn't taste the rice, but I did pick up a good taste of the steak. It wasn't too bad. Now the thing with this place is that they have the steak all precooked and ready to go, and then they throw it back on the griddle to reheat. I know this because I witnessed from behind the counter. At EF, they're constantly grilling meats, so the meat in your meal is freshly grilled, not reheated. \n\nOverall, the taste was pretty satisfying as I had been craving a REAL burrito for some time now. Quesadillas are definitely better at EF, and the burrito is decent. Not the best, but I think I can say it's as good as the EF across the street on a good day. \n\nPrices are a bit more than EF too, a good 50-75 cents more.

I used to order the carne asada tacos every time, which are simple but awesome because their salsa and cilantro are fresh and the meat is cooked perfectly, but now I switch off between both the carne asada and grilled chicken super burritos. If I had it my way I'd order the carne asada burrito every.single.time, but me and my other half usually split them so I'm nice and trade off ;-).  And yes, we split them, which means the super burritos are huge!!! What I love about this place is that they use straight avocado instead of guacamole and the rice is awesome. I also feel like all of the ingredients are perfectly balanced and I never get stuck with a mouthful of just one thing, except maybe the meat which is fine with me.\n\nThe service is always fast even when they are super busy, which is awesome. Of all the times I've been here I think they've messed up my order once, and all they did was accidentally give me regular chicken instead of grilled. NBD. And the burrito was a little sloppy, which is unusual for them, so maybe they were training a new cook or something.\n\nAnyway, the lady who usually takes orders is a little cold, but I think it's just because she suffers from resting bitch face. She's not actually mean or anything. I suffer from this condition as well, but don't be put off by it.

Its a great local Mexican restaurant to go to get burritos, tacos, quesadillas and other food that they offer. \n\nI had the regular burrito with grilled chicken. Even though regular burrito has fewer ingredients than the super burrito, it can still get you full since this place give you a lot of meat, rice, and other ingredients in regular burrito. They usually give you chips whenever you order any kind of burritos.\n\nI also had the super quesadilla suizo with chicken. It's quite big. It has big as the super burrito but more flatter. When you take it to go, you a get a quesadilla that has been cut in half. The super quesadilla can get you really full as well since they put a lot of meat, rices, avocado, and other ingredients. I like that they actually use fresh pieces of avocado rather than the guacamole style. This doesn't come with burrito.\n\nYou can pick your own salsas, since there's more than one, that you want to go with your burritos, quesadillas, and tacos. There's also a mango yellow sauce you can get also but this sauce is quite spiy but still good.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable as well.

I don't like to bite into a burrito with a mouth full of sour cream in each bite. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I prefer Gaudalajara from now on.

I went to this place with my girlfriend earlier this week in an attempt at finding a good taqueria somewhere close to Mission and Geneva.  Rather than going to to El Faro across the street, we picked Guadalajara by a basic coin toss: I wish we had tried the other place!   \n\nWe both ordered the Super Burrito with steak.  Definitely not the cheapest taqueria around: it came to like 18$ for the two burritos and two sodas.  Not terribly expensive but a bit more than I would like to pay for what we got.  They gave free chips and salsa was pretty cool, but they tasted like the chips from the super large bag you buy at Costco - nothing special.  When we got our burritos we were totally starving, but to my dismay there was little to no taste throughout the whole thing.  It was huge, which was nice since we were hungry, but by the last 1/4th of it we both felt a bit nauseous and didn't want to keep going.   It was basically just plain beans, rice, sour cream, and what seemed to be cut up meat with absolutely no seasoning.  The one nice part was that they included whole avocados rather than guacamole, but it didn't make up for the lack of flavor.\n\nI give it a two because it was still a pretty enjoyable time, but had it been a less sunny day I would lean towards a 1-star for pure food critique's sake.

He proclaimed it was the only burrito in the city he couldn't finish in one sitting and to get the verde.\n\nNow I was aware of the place as I have to go to the Post Office on Onondaga twice a month. Wait... *runs down to get the mail and sees another missed you slip* Make that three times a month! The place is at the corner of one of the most delicious intersections on Mission, across the street an El Farrolito, a Hawaiian Drive Inn, and TY Sandwiches. Easily one of the hardest decisions to make. But my roommate got me hyped.\n\nYou walk into a place that looks like it could be at a Disney knockoff, with an interior that makes it look like you are actually in an exterior Mexican neighborhood with windows, lights, and paintings.

So I went for the easier option of 3 tacos - one cabeza, one carnitas, and one pastor.\n\nI got a basket of chips while I waited, and as others have mentioned these chips alone are some of the best. Thick and crispy, these aren't the thin greasy things you get at other taquerias. I should have gotten more. They also have a sauce and salsa bar. The verde is solid, the orange will kick your ass, and I think there was a red.\n\nOf the meats, the cabeza was the weakest. And I love cabeza. The carnitas was excellent, perfectly fried and tasty. But the pastor stole the show. Full of flavor, made with bits of pineapple, I have no problem knowing I'm getting a pastor burrito next time I come. I even tried to scoop as much sauce with my chips as possible. I am glad I saved this taco for last. I also had a tamarind jarritos to wash it all down.

This honestly didn't give me an opinion on which is better. So without trying either before, I went into El Farolitos bought 1 carnitas super burrito with everything and 1 ceviche. Then walked to Guadalajara and bought the same thing except with a steak burrito instead. I also got nachos from Guadalajara because there was consensus that the nachos here were better. \n\nWhen I got home I put the burritos next to each other to see which was bigger. El Farolitos is about an inch longer and both were about the width (insert penis joke here). \n\nI cut both in half and El Farolitos burrito was definitely more juicy because I think they add more cheese or something. However, Guadalajara's burrito had large chunks of   avocado and the steak was really flavorful and delicious. If I had to choose which was better, I have to choose El Farolitos however but Guadalajara is definitely a very very close second. \n\nNext is the ceviche. I have to say that Guadalajara absolutely destroys El Farolitos. Guadalajara's was really fresh and the shrimp and fish were crunchy and not fishy tasting at all. The El Farolitos was soft and tasted old and fishy. \n\nThe Nacho's at Guadalahara was also really good. I got chicken on it just so I could have all three types of meat. Guadalahara really knows how to cook their chicken and steak. Super delicious. I kind of wish they offered the crappy nacho cheese however because it makes the chips a lot easier to eat but i guess that doesn't make the nachos authentic then. \n\nFinally, a review of the salsa bar. Both salsa's were delicious but Guadalajara had much more variety. They also had this orange habanero salsa that was ridiculously spicy. My sister loved it but I just dipped the corner of a chip into the salsa and started coughing. \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with either taqueria. Both are high quality and you would never regret going to one over the other. Both burritos were one of the top I've ever had. It all depends which type you like. More avocados and guacamole = guadalajara and more sauce and more cheese = El Farolitos. Ceviche, is clearly won by guadalajara. Finally service at both was really good.

I love their carne asada. It's not dry or super chewy. It's a juicy tender goodness that gets the burrito craving done.\n\nMy second go-to order is their shrimp quesadilla (also on a spinach tortilla). Their quesadillas are huge. You get two pieces.

I've come here enough times and she's consistently friendly with me now, no biggie. The morning and afternoon waitress is such a dear though. \n\n3. Some more random thoughts: I've come here around 5:30 and I've stood in front of the counter for a full ten minutes while the waitresses were counting all the money in the register without saying ANYTHING to me (no hi, sorry, nothing). Probably tallying the early shift's transactions. Also, during the non-busy hours, don't be surprised to come to an empty counter and wait a few minutes before a waitress shows up to take your order while she's tending to other stuff in the back (slightly understaffed?). \n\nAll these issues are minor and will probably be encountered by someone who come here pretty often. But if it happens enough times when I'm just expecting a smooth \"take out and pig out,\" gets a bit annoying. \n\nLast note: this place is packed with drunk people on Fri and Sat after midnight.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-07-17"}, {"excerpts": ["got the nachos......

", "In regards to the Super Burrito, my girlfriend loved it as well.\n\n"], "author": "Bryan W.", "review": "If you are in San Francisco and craving Mexican food (particularly tacos, burritos, or quesadillas), you are truly, truly blessed. Because the city, specifically San Francisco's Mission Street, is a gold mine for one of the best Taquerias in the Bay Area. On many people's lists, you will find three different places that sell \"life-changing\" food: El Farolito, La Taqueria, and Taqueria Guadalajara. \n\nDue to all the hype, I've actually had El Farolito more times than I can remember; I can honestly say that their Super Quesadilla (Suiza), in combination with their green sauce, is one of the most amazing things you will ever have in your life. To this day, I haven't found a place that does it better. And La Taqueria, has there ever been a place that's attracted SO MANY PEOPLE? According to like everyone, including myself, this place truly does have THE best, if not one of the best carne asada burritos (https://fivethirtyeight.com/burrito/#brackets-view).\n\nBut Taqueria Guadalajara, the third of the trio, I haven't had the chance you eat you up yet...until recently when my girlfriend totally read my mind and decided that we were going to come here! In San Francisco, there are at least two Taqueria Guadalajaras, both ironically on Mission Street. We ended up going to the more popular one in Excelsior as it was closer to us.\n\nThis Taqueria Guadalajara is located right in between Russia and France Avenue on 4798 Mission Street. If you think the names of the streets are awesome, check out what's right across from Guadalajara: El Farolito! That's definitely bold on either end to have your main competitor RIGHT next to you. For parking, traffic may be so-so depending on when you come. We drove in around 12pm on a Sunday and we were able to find a spot on the street after circling once. Unfortunately, you probably will have to pay for parking, but it shouldn't be more than $2 for an hour. I do recommend coming earlier because the place does get packed. We had to wait when we got in, BUT there's plenty of tables so MAJOR PLUS compared to El Farolito at certain times (especially the 16th and Mission one).\n\nIn terms of the menu, Taqueria Guadalajara is your standard Mexican restaurant. This place will have several different options for burritos, tacos, and your favorite quesadillas. Their meats are also standard, with your steak, tripe, etc. They also have horchata too if you are into that. Their pricing is pretty competitive with others. For example, it's like about $10 for a super burrito/quesadilla which is probably what I remembered paying at La Taqueria/El Farolito. My girlfriend and I ended up getting a medium horchata, a super quesadilla, and a super burrito (both with steak). Food came out pretty fast, and here's what we thought...\n\n-Super Quesadilla (8/10). When eating the Super Suiza, I unfortunately already had a preconceived idea that El Farolito's version would be unmatched. However, I actually thought that Gaudalajara's was REALLY GOOD. The steak was cooked extremely well, the quality of the other ingredients were great, and I loved that you do get a large amount of cream cheese. The only real downsides (compared to El Farolito) was that the quesadilla could have had a bit more crunch + this place really needed better side-sauces to boost the appeal of the Suiza. For example, the basic tomato salsa was pretty poor quality (I wouldn't touch this), and they didn't have the green tomatillo sauce!!! However, I would never mind getting this again. In regards to the Super Burrito, my girlfriend loved it as well.\n\n-Horchata (7/10). This place serves your standard horchata. There's nothing really special about it, but it did the trick. It was sweet and served cold!\n\nOverall, would I say that Taqueria Guadalajara reins supreme? Nope, I'm slightly (over) loyal to El Farolito. However, I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was GREAT, there's lots of room to eat even though the place is small/there's a steady line of people, and the food was pretty delicious. I have to give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating.

I figured this came with the territory of working the night shift. She then didn't make eye contact with me when I ordered. Rude, but ok. Grabbed to-go order, head home, which isn't more than like 7 minutes driving. The nachos were SOGGY. Like, not slightly wet because salsa drippins'. Like, they've been sitting there a few hours soggy. Like they've returned to their original state and are useless for transporting toppings to your mouth. The distribution was sloppy; some nachos had all avocado, some all meat. It was sloppy and poorly done. Meager amounts of everything except chicken. They didn't care. \n\nFor the burrito, I asked for no salsa or pica de gallo or onion cilantro mix, and there was some in there anyway. The chicken was good, but for a super burrito, it was JUST chicken, beans and cheese. Again, a ton of chicken and nothing else.\n\nThe salsas were good (loved the green one), and the chicken was solid but they stop caring at night and are rude.

"], "author": "Jonathan L.", "review": "This is an official review of both Guadalajara and El Farolitos.\n\nAll I've read from Guadalajara reviews is \"El Farolitos sucks!\" and vice versa from El Farlitos reviews about Guadalajara. This honestly didn't give me an opinion on which is better. So without trying either before, I went into El Farolitos bought 1 carnitas super burrito with everything and 1 ceviche. Then walked to Guadalajara and bought the same thing except with a steak burrito instead. I also got nachos from Guadalajara because there was consensus that the nachos here were better. \n\nWhen I got home I put the burritos next to each other to see which was bigger. El Farolitos is about an inch longer and both were about the width (insert penis joke here). \n\nI cut both in half and El Farolitos burrito was definitely more juicy because I think they add more cheese or something. However, Guadalajara's burrito had large chunks of   avocado and the steak was really flavorful and delicious. If I had to choose which was better, I have to choose El Farolitos however but Guadalajara is definitely a very very close second. \n\nNext is the ceviche. I have to say that Guadalajara absolutely destroys El Farolitos. Guadalajara's was really fresh and the shrimp and fish were crunchy and not fishy tasting at all. The El Farolitos was soft and tasted old and fishy. \n\nThe Nacho's at Guadalahara was also really good. I got chicken on it just so I could have all three types of meat. Guadalahara really knows how to cook their chicken and steak. Super delicious. I kind of wish they offered the crappy nacho cheese however because it makes the chips a lot easier to eat but i guess that doesn't make the nachos authentic then. \n\nFinally, a review of the salsa bar. Both salsa's were delicious but Guadalajara had much more variety. They also had this orange habanero salsa that was ridiculously spicy. My sister loved it but I just dipped the corner of a chip into the salsa and started coughing. \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with either taqueria. Both are high quality and you would never regret going to one over the other. Both burritos were one of the top I've ever had. It all depends which type you like. More avocados and guacamole = guadalajara and more sauce and more cheese = El Farolitos. Ceviche, is clearly won by guadalajara. Finally service at both was really good. The guy at El Farolitos didn't talk to me as much but the lady at Guadalajara was really nice and tried to explain what certain things on the menu was.

I would give it a 4 but let me explain. \n\nFirst off - the food is delicious. I usually get a super burrito with steak and \"everything.\" I've also tried the super quesadilla and nachos. The burrito is always juicy, seasoned well and the pieces of avocado (present in a lot of their dishes) is a nice touch. The portions are big. If you include the free tortilla chips, you can feed a small village. The salsa bar is loaded with choices and the fresh tomato salsa is DELICIOUS. \n\nSo why the relatively low rating for great food? Because there's always something happening that prevents a smooth experience here for me. This is a burrito joint, establishments that I associate with - get in, order what I want, get out, quickly drive 3 minutes home, hide in my man cave and devour everything. \n\n 1. They will only cook you the full menu IF they're in the mood. I have different cravings at times. When I'm fully shitfaced after a good drinking sesh, I really crave a breakfast burrito (chorizo + eggs). However, they'll serve it to you sometimes and not others. I've tried ordering it in the morning - \"no chorizo.\" I've successfully ordered at night but one instance particularly stood out. I ordered a breakfast burrito, the tall head waitress lady turns to the cook, asked if he's willing to make it, he shook his head and the lady denied my order. Probably \"no chorizo\" is a better response. Oh, you'll also hear \"no tripe\" from time to time too. \n\n2. Ohhhhh the tall head waitress lady who works the afternoon/night/grave shift. She's really ok, she really is. She'll be friendly at times and not others. When it gets busy, she does the thing where she starts taking orders from the person after you while STILL tending to you. One particular instance: she started tending to the next customer while refusing to give me change until I asked 1min later, then which she promptly put me in my place with some sharp words. I've come here enough times and she's consistently friendly with me now, no biggie. The morning and afternoon waitress is such a dear though. \n\n3. Some more random thoughts: I've come here around 5:30 and I've stood in front of the counter for a full ten minutes while the waitresses were counting all the money in the register without saying ANYTHING to me (no hi, sorry, nothing). Probably tallying the early shift's transactions. Also, during the non-busy hours, don't be surprised to come to an empty counter and wait a few minutes before a waitress shows up to take your order while she's tending to other stuff in the back (slightly understaffed?). \n\nAll these issues are minor and will probably be encountered by someone who come here pretty often. But if it happens enough times when I'm just expecting a smooth \"take out and pig out,\" gets a bit annoying. \n\nLast note: this place is packed with drunk people on Fri and Sat after midnight.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-07-17"}, {"excerpts": ["I usually go for a Carne Asada super burrito.

I usually get a super burrito with steak and \"everything.\" I've also tried the super quesadilla and nachos. The burrito is always juicy, seasoned well and the pieces of avocado (present in a lot of their dishes) is a nice touch. The portions are big. If you include the free tortilla chips, you can feed a small village. The salsa bar is loaded with choices and the fresh tomato salsa is DELICIOUS. \n\nSo why the relatively low rating for great food? Because there's always something happening that prevents a smooth experience here for me. This is a burrito joint, establishments that I associate with - get in, order what I want, get out, quickly drive 3 minutes home, hide in my man cave and devour everything. \n\n 1. They will only cook you the full menu IF they're in the mood. I have different cravings at times.

I ordered a breakfast burrito, the tall head waitress lady turns to the cook, asked if he's willing to make it, he shook his head and the lady denied my order. Probably \"no chorizo\" is a better response. Oh, you'll also hear \"no tripe\" from time to time too. \n\n2. Ohhhhh the tall head waitress lady who works the afternoon/night/grave shift. She's really ok, she really is. She'll be friendly at times and not others. When it gets busy, she does the thing where she starts taking orders from the person after you while STILL tending to you. One particular instance: she started tending to the next customer while refusing to give me change until I asked 1min later, then which she promptly put me in my place with some sharp words. I've come here enough times and she's consistently friendly with me now, no biggie. The morning and afternoon waitress is such a dear though. \n\n3. Some more random thoughts: I've come here around 5:30 and I've stood in front of the counter for a full ten minutes while the waitresses were counting all the money in the register without saying ANYTHING to me (no hi, sorry, nothing). Probably tallying the early shift's transactions. Also, during the non-busy hours, don't be surprised to come to an empty counter and wait a few minutes before a waitress shows up to take your order while she's tending to other stuff in the back (slightly understaffed?). \n\nAll these issues are minor and will probably be encountered by someone who come here pretty often. But if it happens enough times when I'm just expecting a smooth \"take out and pig out,\" gets a bit annoying. \n\nLast note: this place is packed with drunk people on Fri and Sat after midnight.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-07-17"}, {"excerpts": ["Good breakfast burrito.\n\n"], "author": "Steve R.", "review": "Some of the best pollo asado in the city.

If you think the names of the streets are awesome, check out what's right across from Guadalajara: El Farolito! That's definitely bold on either end to have your main competitor RIGHT next to you. For parking, traffic may be so-so depending on when you come. We drove in around 12pm on a Sunday and we were able to find a spot on the street after circling once. Unfortunately, you probably will have to pay for parking, but it shouldn't be more than $2 for an hour. I do recommend coming earlier because the place does get packed. We had to wait when we got in, BUT there's plenty of tables so MAJOR PLUS compared to El Farolito at certain times (especially the 16th and Mission one).\n\nIn terms of the menu, Taqueria Guadalajara is your standard Mexican restaurant. This place will have several different options for burritos, tacos, and your favorite quesadillas. Their meats are also standard, with your steak, tripe, etc. They also have horchata too if you are into that. Their pricing is pretty competitive with others. For example, it's like about $10 for a super burrito/quesadilla which is probably what I remembered paying at La Taqueria/El Farolito. My girlfriend and I ended up getting a medium horchata, a super quesadilla, and a super burrito (both with steak). Food came out pretty fast, and here's what we thought...\n\n-Super Quesadilla (8/10). When eating the Super Suiza, I unfortunately already had a preconceived idea that El Farolito's version would be unmatched. However, I actually thought that Gaudalajara's was REALLY GOOD. The steak was cooked extremely well, the quality of the other ingredients were great, and I loved that you do get a large amount of cream cheese. The only real downsides (compared to El Farolito) was that the quesadilla could have had a bit more crunch + this place really needed better side-sauces to boost the appeal of the Suiza. For example, the basic tomato salsa was pretty poor quality (I wouldn't touch this), and they didn't have the green tomatillo sauce!!! However, I would never mind getting this again. In regards to the Super Burrito, my girlfriend loved it as well.\n\n-Horchata (7/10). This place serves your standard horchata. There's nothing really special about it, but it did the trick. It was sweet and served cold!\n\nOverall, would I say that Taqueria Guadalajara reins supreme? Nope, I'm slightly (over) loyal to El Farolito. However, I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was GREAT, there's lots of room to eat even though the place is small/there's a steady line of people, and the food was pretty delicious. I have to give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating. Next step, Taqueria Cancun! \n\nEat well and prosper,", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-08-15"}, {"excerpts": ["This place never gets old, love anything with carne asada.\n\n"], "author": "Toni Rose M.", "review": "This place never gets old, love anything with carne asada.\n\nI always get the super burrito here or the quesadillas.

I took to my Yelp app and looked what was highly rated and still open, as it was getting near 1am. My friend suggested a nearby taqueria that is open to 3am, but we decided we'd try something new.\n\nTaqueria Guadalajara is conveniently located on a corner of Mission Street between Leo Street and Russia Ave. The taqeria has a bright and over-sized neon sign proudly displaying its name. The taqueria has a small dining area and displays its menu right behind the register and kitchen area.\n\nThe menu has all your standard Mexican fare, including: dinner plates, burriots, tortas, and tacos. As a Mexican-American, I have authentic Mexican at home on a daily basis, so I'm a tough critic at taquerias. My usual taste test consists of trying a variety of tacos or a taco-dinner plate. I went with three regular tacos: a carne asada, a pollo asado, and al pastor. The total came to less than $9 with my diet coke. I forked over the cash and was given chips and directed to the salsa bar.\n\nThe salsa bar has a bit of selection with four or five fresh salsas, as well as fresh cilantro, limes, jalapenos, etc. I tried a few of the salsas, but fell in love with one in particular. Moments later my tacos were brought to my table and they looked great, as they didn't appear greasy and the meat looked of high-quality while portion size was just right.\n\nI took my first few bites and the food was delicious and rivaled that of a Mexican backyard party. The carne was tender, juicy, and flavorful, most notably the carne asada and al pastor. Each tacos was topped with cilantro and their house salsa, whch added flavor but didn't overpower the taco overall. If I had to choose which was best of the three, I'd have to say the carne asada was my favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the three.\n\nAlthough the taqueria is rather small, it does boasts a lively dining area with murals, making it a \"romatic\" eatery as per the SF State paper. You can't go wrong with the authentic Mission Mexican food of Taqueria Guadalajara, whether taking out or dining in and enjoying a Spanish novela on their 25\" tube tv.\n\nAmbiance: 3 Stars (out of 5)\nFood: 4 Stars (out of 5)\nService: 4 Stars (out of 5)\nPrice: $\nOverall: 4 Stars (out of 5)", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I always get the super burrito with carne asada, everything on it.

At EF, they're constantly grilling meats, so the meat in your meal is freshly grilled, not reheated. \n\nOverall, the taste was pretty satisfying as I had been craving a REAL burrito for some time now.

The interesting thing is that it also comes with 3 Thick (diameter of my thumb) MUTANT sized grilled green scallions(at least 8 inches each) on top of the meat.  I guess you are supposed to somehow eat the scallions with the steak.  I experimented with wrapping a tortilla with the monster scallion and a slice of the steak with avocado and green salsa.  Not too bad, it tasted similar to the Yakitori style skewered chicken with scallion in Japan. Next tried cutting the steak with the plastic knife they have, the results were good since the steaks are kind of thin.  The mutant scallions, however were impossible to cut with the plastic utensil.  The taste is also good eating it individually, however I think wrapping it all in a tortilla tasted better somehow.  \n\nI thought this place is very nice, the service is friendlier than the mission district I think.

This place is somewhat new, as years ago I remember it being something else.  The tables on the inside are veryclose together, and it's easier to sit on the outside isle, so you don't have to bump other people to get to a vacant table.  It looks to be pretty crowded most of the time.\n\nAnyway, I ordered a quesidilla suiza with al pastor.  I wanted to like it, and I did, but the pork was very greasy ... more greasy than it should have been, with lots of chunks of pork fat.  I was disappointed that it lacked flavor.  Next time I will have carne asada.  I am not a big fan of burritos, as it's too much rice and beans, so I opt for just meat and cheese.  They also have Alambres, which I will have sometime to compare to El Farrolito across the street.\n\nThe salsa bar is very good too.  They had this ... I am not sure what it is called, and if somebody can tell me what it is, I would appreciate it.  I've seen it in other taquerias too.  It has peppers, onions, vinegar maybe, and shredded carrots in it.  I did not try that, but it looks interesting, but not sure what it's for.  The fresh salsa is very tasty and not too spicy.  I am a big fan of fresh salsa, and really liked this one.  I also had a roasted tomato one maybe??  More liquid-y than the fresh salsa, but equally good, but less chunky.  I will have to combine the two next time.\n\nCheck it out!", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-02-02"}], "enchiladas": [{"excerpts": ["I don't think the enchiladas are on the menu but they are available for order.

Sooooo it goes a little something like this...........\n\n\nLate night, and the bf and i were hungey. I really wanted mexican food, well shoot let me be frank, i was totally craving it and wouldnt stop till i got some!!! \nTo the Yelp app we go in search of a near by Taqueria. After a couple of places that seemed like they were good, we would scroll down only to find out it was \"Cash Only\" darn it, back to the searching.  Then all of the sudden it was like the heaven's opened up because there stood a great place. Open late (check), Accepted Credit Cards and Cash (check), Good reviews by fellow elites and non elites (check).  So we got up and off we were to the Taqueria which was just a hop,skip and a jump down the freeway from our hotel.\nNow here is the funny part: While parking is easy (mainly street parking), we walked into Taqueria Guadalajara and not the one we were ment to go to (which was directly across the street from this one).  After looking over the menu which included not only tacos but also had: Quesadilla,Burritos, and various combo plates. Prices and service are not half bad either. \nAfter fighting with myself (as i always do in this case) i went with:\n\nCheese Enchiladas-Rolled corn tortillas topped with red sauce and melted cheese; served with rice, refried beans and sour cream, avocado, lettuce, tomato.  \n\nFound a seat next to the window and out of the way of the small line that was starting to form with other hungry late nighters just waiting to get their grub on.\n\nMade our way over to the salsa bar to load up on salsa. By the way the Avocado Salsa verde was the bees knees,  i couldnt stop eating it, along with the free basket of chips (that were not oily or overcooked) that was delivered to out table shortly after we came back. \n\nOur food was brought out to us by a nice server. And OMG WOW.. My plate was huge!!! I didnt expect it to be this big for the price that we paid!  There sitting in front of me was 3 prefect Enchiladas staring back at me saying \"Eat me, im yummy and delish\". Okay i said as i took my first bite.  \nIt was hot, gooey and tasted almost as good as my homemade cheese Enchiladas!! Which i suddenly knew i had to make soon!! About 20 minutes later there was hardly anything left on the large plate. My mexican food craving has been totally satisfied!!\n\nIm so glad that we \"walked into\" this Taqueria by accident the food, service and over all cleanness gets a A++ in my book!!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-07-06"}, {"excerpts": ["Tacos, wet burrito and enchiladas is what I usually crave for here at this neighborhood gem.
