The individual chocolates are displayed in a glass window and the large menu is above the register; makes it really easy to order. \n\nI just love their San Francisco Collection, which is a 12-piece box. Pictured on the chocolates are the Golden Gate Bridge, the Painted Ladies, Alcatraz, and SF's iconic cable car. So adorable! The flavors of the chocolates are hazelnut, champagne, dark chocolate, and fernet. The hazelnut was my favorite. It had a crispy interior, which was a textural contrast to the creamy chocolate. \n\nAs far as the coffee goes, the truffogato is adorably tiny but packs a big punch! It's strong espresso with a chocolate marshmallow. The soco-latte (mocha) is more my speed. And the chocolate marshmallow was delicious!", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-11-21"}], "raspberry pop rocks chocolate bar": [], "signature selection chocolate truffles": [], "socola full tower": [], "socola lovers dream chocolate truffles": [], "socola mini tower of truffles": [], "sriracha flying rooster truffles": [], "stout beer truffles": [], "sweetheart collection truffles": [], "tea collection  jasmine earl grey matcha green masala chai": [], "vietnamese espresso chocolate truffles": [], "guava pate de fruit": [], "salty chewy caramels": [], "individual pieces": [], "piece box": [{"excerpts": ["I was gifted a 12 piece box of Socola Chocolate artisan truffles as a christmas present.
