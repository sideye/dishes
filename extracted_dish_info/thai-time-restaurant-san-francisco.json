With its uninspiring interpretations of Thai classics, Thai Time proves this a fallacy.\n\nLiterally a hole in the wall with fewer than ten glass-covered tables, it is obvious that Thai Time doesn't aspire to greatness.  Rather, it attempts only to be an inexpensive, neighborhood Thai place where diners can get in, get some decent, if unimaginative, food, and get out quickly without sacrificing their entire paycheck.  In this, it pretty much succeeds.  Albeit, diners should not expect more.\n\nAccompanied by the traditional peanut sauce and cucumber salad, the Chicken satay was fine, but could have featured a more flavorful marinade.  Although hearty and warming on a cold Richmond evening, the tom yung kung soup could have been spicier.

Inexplicably, there was no jasmine rice available, but at least management had the foresight to offer brown rice.\n\nService was awkward and slow.  It was quite a while before the waitress took the order, and upon doing so, there seemed to be a difficulty in \"getting it.\"  The waitress incorrectly totaled the bill and nearly forgot to include some of the left overs in the take-home bag.\n\nAt Thai Time, look only for standards--pad Thai, satays, curries, etc.  Don't expect anything bordering on interesting--mieng kum (a favorite Thai self-made snack with spinach leaves, roasted peanuts and coconut, fresh lime, ginger, onion, and chopped Thai chili peppers) or anything that would require higher level kitchen skills (for example, tom yam pla, steamed sea bass, mushrooms, and tomatoes flavored with lemongrass and kaffir leaves.)  \n\nWith straightforward food and only fair service, Thai Time's saving grace is that its prices are reasonable, even by Richmond standards.

Such a wonderful day to take a drive to the City and soak in the sun. My girls wanted to hit the Exploratorium. And we were hungry for lunch. After writing 13 reviews - yes, I'm just a Yelp beginner, folks - I thought , alright, I'm going to put Yelp to work finally and find good Thai. This literal \"hole in the wall\" turned up as one of three Thai restaurants in the City with a 4.5 rating. (No 5 rating places, by the way.) We actually tried to go to one of the \"other\" 4.5 places right around the corner on Geary, but lucky for us, it was closed. Thai Time did not disappoint! No way! Great stuff here folks!\n\nUpon walking through the door, the first thing I thought was - oooh, wow, pretty small. I think my master bedroom is bigger than the dining area! My wife counted enough seats for, hmmm, maybe 26 \"small\" patrons. Luckily I'm one of those small patrons - yah, right! Hah! Do I 'eat to live', or do I 'live to eat'? Uhhhhh, hmmmm, I think the latter! Don't let the small surroundings scare you away, 'cause it'll be your loss!\n\nOkay, time to order. The soft-spoken server made several recommendations, almost all of them seafood (I think they might specialize in seafood). But my family wasn't in the mood for seafood today, so we tried the following:\n\n- Satay (chicken), as an appetizer\n- Tofu Tod, as an appetizer\n- Gang Dang (beef), as an entree\n- Gang Garee Gai, as an entree\n- Moo Yang, as an entree\n\nDelightful food! The Satay was solid in taste. My little one loved it, so I think it was right on the money. The tofu was also very good, cut in a smaller, triangular 3-dimensional shape than you're used to in other Thai restaurants, and we counted this as yet another plus, because they were bite-size for the kids. Delightful appetizers!\n\nNow for the entrees. My wife felt strongly that we specify the dishes to be \"mild\", because she believes that you'll find more \"truly\" spiced Thai in the City, as opposed to Thai fare in the burbs. I think she was right. The \"mild\" Gang Dang had a tiny \"kick\" to it, but I didn't mind. I loved it. And, I usually don't like bamboo shoots, but the Gang Dang had the shoots cut thinner than usual, and they complemented my meal fine. The Gang Garee Gai is your typical Yellow Curry Chicken - delicious here at Thai Time. The potatoes, in particular, were cooked well, teaming with the onions and savory yellow sauce to make the chicken dance on your taste buds. And the Moo Yang was great too - your typical honey-grilled-pork, but satisfying with every bite. Delightful entrees!\n\nUhhhh, we're not done yet! There's dessert too. The sticky rice and mango was just right. Outside of the Philippines, I seldom eat mangoes, but the one on the plate today was sweet and enjoyable for me. We also had the peculiar \"Roti\". I was curious about this, 'cause I thought Roti was Indian, not Thai. The server returned with the Roti, explaining that this was their \"Thai\" version, and what a yummy dessert it was! Thin, moist yet crispy (on the edges) bread, covered with condensed milk and sugar. Wow! Delightful desserts!\n\nIn the end, I give Thai Time 4.5 STARS. Wonderful Thai food. Attentive service. Much better than my usual \"burb\" Thai cuisine, but then again, this is City Thai, right? Whenever I'm back in the area, I'll definitely return to sample something new from their extensive menu.

I decided to order the Gang Dang, no no not because it has such a rad name, but because the combination of chicken, spicy red curry, coconut milk, bamboo shoots, Japanese eggplant ,bell pepper and sweet basil...Yum.

The gang dang was good, spicy the way a red curry should be. The eggplant was soft and not bitter, but the chicken was not my thing. I am a picky meat eater, I like boneless, white meat chicken cooked very well done. The chicken was a lot of dark meat and just tasted like slimy chicken. So once I took out the chicken, I totally enjoyed my dish. I will definitely order tofu next time. \nAs for the Garee Puffs, they were good fried little triangle pouches with some tasty pasty insides and the peanut dipping sauce was also good.\nMy brother order the Yellow curry which he said was good but not as curry-ee as he likes.

Such a wonderful day to take a drive to the City and soak in the sun. My girls wanted to hit the Exploratorium. And we were hungry for lunch. After writing 13 reviews - yes, I'm just a Yelp beginner, folks - I thought , alright, I'm going to put Yelp to work finally and find good Thai. This literal \"hole in the wall\" turned up as one of three Thai restaurants in the City with a 4.5 rating. (No 5 rating places, by the way.) We actually tried to go to one of the \"other\" 4.5 places right around the corner on Geary, but lucky for us, it was closed. Thai Time did not disappoint! No way! Great stuff here folks!\n\nUpon walking through the door, the first thing I thought was - oooh, wow, pretty small. I think my master bedroom is bigger than the dining area! My wife counted enough seats for, hmmm, maybe 26 \"small\" patrons. Luckily I'm one of those small patrons - yah, right! Hah! Do I 'eat to live', or do I 'live to eat'? Uhhhhh, hmmmm, I think the latter! Don't let the small surroundings scare you away, 'cause it'll be your loss!\n\nOkay, time to order. The soft-spoken server made several recommendations, almost all of them seafood (I think they might specialize in seafood). But my family wasn't in the mood for seafood today, so we tried the following:\n\n- Satay (chicken), as an appetizer\n- Tofu Tod, as an appetizer\n- Gang Dang (beef), as an entree\n- Gang Garee Gai, as an entree\n- Moo Yang, as an entree\n\nDelightful food! The Satay was solid in taste. My little one loved it, so I think it was right on the money. The tofu was also very good, cut in a smaller, triangular 3-dimensional shape than you're used to in other Thai restaurants, and we counted this as yet another plus, because they were bite-size for the kids. Delightful appetizers!\n\nNow for the entrees. My wife felt strongly that we specify the dishes to be \"mild\", because she believes that you'll find more \"truly\" spiced Thai in the City, as opposed to Thai fare in the burbs. I think she was right. The \"mild\" Gang Dang had a tiny \"kick\" to it, but I didn't mind. I loved it. And, I usually don't like bamboo shoots, but the Gang Dang had the shoots cut thinner than usual, and they complemented my meal fine. The Gang Garee Gai is your typical Yellow Curry Chicken - delicious here at Thai Time. The potatoes, in particular, were cooked well, teaming with the onions and savory yellow sauce to make the chicken dance on your taste buds. And the Moo Yang was great too - your typical honey-grilled-pork, but satisfying with every bite. Delightful entrees!\n\nUhhhh, we're not done yet! There's dessert too. The sticky rice and mango was just right. Outside of the Philippines, I seldom eat mangoes, but the one on the plate today was sweet and enjoyable for me. We also had the peculiar \"Roti\". I was curious about this, 'cause I thought Roti was Indian, not Thai. The server returned with the Roti, explaining that this was their \"Thai\" version, and what a yummy dessert it was! Thin, moist yet crispy (on the edges) bread, covered with condensed milk and sugar. Wow! Delightful desserts!\n\nIn the end, I give Thai Time 4.5 STARS. Wonderful Thai food. Attentive service. Much better than my usual \"burb\" Thai cuisine, but then again, this is City Thai, right? Whenever I'm back in the area, I'll definitely return to sample something new from their extensive menu.

The portion was quite generous, as it was loaded with chicken, onions and potatoes, so kudos for that.  Even more so for the tastiness.  I didn't get to try what a couple of my friends had ordered, but I did get to sneak a bite of the Pad Thai dish my other friend had ordered.  She read it was supposed to be unique since they use coconut milk (?), but I didnt really taste a strong flavor of it.

T explains that's because there are no restaurants right by the park, one must walk a few blocks to reach the commercial side of things, so it is more residential. I have known to run into people I know whenever I'm in Hayes Valley, downtown, SoMa and the Mission, and so far, I've been very lucky to not have done that thus far in this neighborhood, which of course, is a HUGE plus because privacy and personal space are very important aspects in achieving quality of life. When you can eat in peace,  you can start to appreciate the diversity this place offers. It's not just izakaya, there are Thai restaurants too. I learned quickly that that southeastern Asia cuisine is fairly good. This place is more than fairly good. It's in fact excellent.\n\nVegetarian curry is superbly done. T knows what I like to eat by now. I don't like too much curry too much coconut, it has to be just right. There is a delicate balance to strike and Thai Time seems to have executed it perfectly. I like good chicken wings. We got that for protein. Peanut sauce covered fried wings. What's not to like? Mango salad was my contribution to that evening's dinner menu. It has shrimp and squid, and it's milder than the papaya salad but I liked it more. Garlic rice is portioned just right. Get only one bowl to share with two people, it's very dense and flavorful. If you must kiss your companion after the meal, please brush your teeth and use mouthwash first.\n\nThe restaurant is very intimate. When we arrived there were quite a few seats available,  but by 8:30 it was packed full, with a few folks waiting outside.  I grabbed the seat facing out, so I could observe the occasional night dog walkers or the drunken crowd coming out of Halu.\n\nSatisfied with the meal, we took the long route back, finding suitable and relatively new restaurants along the way for future food expedition. I leave in a couple of days for Asia. My life is decidedly different than last year this time. I have been seeking for an enthused food companion for a long time now, perhaps forever. \n\nHere is the short version of my quest for that companion: I seek no commitment nor fidelity, but you must like this restaurant as much as I do.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-02-04"}, {"excerpts": ["The deep fried crab with mango salad is amazing, try it with a fresh coconut"], "author": "Christine E.", "review": "Very small restaurant with only nine tables.

And the Garee Puff; deep-fried saut\u00e9ed sweet potato and onion; served with peanut sauce and cucumber salad... also yum. \nSo order in and excited for Thai food, my doorbell rings 17 minutes later. There's no way this could be the Tai food.....but wait....IT IS!  So for the super fast and efficient delivery of hot tasty smelling Thai food I give Thai Time at least 2 stars.\nHuge Portions of the curry dishes. The gang dang was good, spicy the way a red curry should be. The eggplant was soft and not bitter, but the chicken was not my thing. I am a picky meat eater, I like boneless, white meat chicken cooked very well done. The chicken was a lot of dark meat and just tasted like slimy chicken. So once I took out the chicken, I totally enjoyed my dish. I will definitely order tofu next time. \nAs for the Garee Puffs, they were good fried little triangle pouches with some tasty pasty insides and the peanut dipping sauce was also good.\nMy brother order the Yellow curry which he said was good but not as curry-ee as he likes. He said it just tasted watered down. \nSo now it has been almost an hour since eating and all is quiet on the western front.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "So when is Thai Time anyways? -- ANYTIME. All the food here is really that good, and it's literally open all day every day. \n\nAfter trying a slew of Thai restaurants around the SF Bay Area, I find most of them sufficient at satisfying my Pad Thai cravings, but the only ones that really blow me away are Kin Khao (can't argue with the Michelin star), Farmhouse (hipster setting and unique dishes), and Thai Time. While the former two are bouge and expensive, Thai Time's prices are a steal. Lunch specials are ~$7-8, and dinner entrees are ~$9 and under $15.... which in SF gets you artisan avo toast and craft coffee.\n\nThai Time has the vibe of a local small business, no-frills but clean and well kept. The setting features lots of traditional Thai decor in a cozy space. Note that with ~8 tables inside, the wait can be long. (Came at 9pm on Sunday with the wait nearly an hour; however there was no wait at 6pm on Friday.) \n\nThe menu is huge, including all your Thai food staples in addition a wide selection of unique Thai dishes I haven't seen at other places. Making decisions can be overwhelming; when in doubt, choose from the \"Thai Time Favorites\" to try their specialties. They also have a specials menu board posted. \n\n(+++) Angel Wings ($9.20): I've had this before at Cambodian restaurants, and Thai Time's version is definitely among my favorites. Not only are you amazed by the feat of how the wings are deboned (though note some bones at the tips) and stuffed with ground pork, silver noodles, and mushrooms; the delightfully thin panko crust and tangy sweet and sour sauce add nice flairs to create a very appetizing appetizer.\n\n(+++) Hor Mok Talay ($14): Looks great and tastes even better. The sauteed prawns, calamari, scallops, mussels, and crab are submerged in a delicious coconuty red curry sauce, all inside a coconut (!!) You scrape the sides to add more coconut meat to the melange, creating a scrumptious and multi-dimensional dish. Be aware that it's quite filling from all the coconut; that it's incredibly delicious and difficult to stop eating :x\n\n(+++) Green Curry Duck ($11.35): The green curry has the same aromatic coconuty tones, with more depth and savoriness compared to the red curry. We were also impressed by the seemingly endless chunks of meaty, juicy duck slices. \n\n(++) Ped Yang ($10.75): Same great boneless duck, served another way. Being accustomed to crispy roast duck, the syrupy-saucey version took a bit of getting used to. I grew to like the interesting paradox of such a thick sauce with such light flavor that physically smothered yet subtly augmented the taste of the duck. \n\n(++) Thai Rib ($10.55): A curry version of galbi. I don't know about the texture of the ribs, which were charboiled to very dry, almost like jerky. It's still quite good considering it's covered in the creamy red curry sauce for balance; just don't be expecting fall-off-the-bone braised ribs.\n\n(++) Pad Sai Roong ($9.70): There's something about the surface area and texture of the thin silver noodles that has a lighter mouthfeel than carby rice noodles, and Thai Time does it just right with a light soy sauce and a bucketload of assorted vegetables and shrimp.\n\nPortions are ginormous, but I suggest ordering more and taking home leftovers so that you can try different dishes. Not only are the portion sizes decently sized; the generous amounts of duck/seafood essentially make all other restaurants in SF look stingy.\n\nOther tips:\n*This is totally a raving review, but be careful not to hike up unrealistic expectations only to get disappointed.\n*Take-out available. May be most efficient if there's a long wait.\n*Thai tea comes with a very artistically (Instagram-worthy) folded straw wrapper.\n*We were curious about Thai Crepe and Hod Thai (pan-fried mussels), but it wasn't available on both of our visits. We were bummed, though the server explained that they take a lot of time to prepare so isn't served all the time.\n*Parking isn't impossible, just may take some circling around. There's a public lot nearby which charges the same as street meters (free after 6pm and all day Sundays).\n*Don't come in a huge group since the space is small. But do consider coming in up to 4, so that you can try more dishes. Note that the tables are compact as well, so eat efficiently to make space for the next round. \n\nTL;DR: Thai Time is one of those amazing niches that's worth coming back until you try the entire menu. \n\nGeez, this review makes me sound like a glutton, but Thai Time really is that good.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-06-24"}, {"excerpts": ["What was really good in the end was the green curry duck.

All the food here is really that good, and it's literally open all day every day. \n\nAfter trying a slew of Thai restaurants around the SF Bay Area, I find most of them sufficient at satisfying my Pad Thai cravings, but the only ones that really blow me away are Kin Khao (can't argue with the Michelin star), Farmhouse (hipster setting and unique dishes), and Thai Time. While the former two are bouge and expensive, Thai Time's prices are a steal. Lunch specials are ~$7-8, and dinner entrees are ~$9 and under $15.... which in SF gets you artisan avo toast and craft coffee.\n\nThai Time has the vibe of a local small business, no-frills but clean and well kept. The setting features lots of traditional Thai decor in a cozy space. Note that with ~8 tables inside, the wait can be long. (Came at 9pm on Sunday with the wait nearly an hour; however there was no wait at 6pm on Friday.) \n\nThe menu is huge, including all your Thai food staples in addition a wide selection of unique Thai dishes I haven't seen at other places. Making decisions can be overwhelming; when in doubt, choose from the \"Thai Time Favorites\" to try their specialties. They also have a specials menu board posted. \n\n(+++) Angel Wings ($9.20): I've had this before at Cambodian restaurants, and Thai Time's version is definitely among my favorites. Not only are you amazed by the feat of how the wings are deboned (though note some bones at the tips) and stuffed with ground pork, silver noodles, and mushrooms; the delightfully thin panko crust and tangy sweet and sour sauce add nice flairs to create a very appetizing appetizer.\n\n(+++) Hor Mok Talay ($14): Looks great and tastes even better. The sauteed prawns, calamari, scallops, mussels, and crab are submerged in a delicious coconuty red curry sauce, all inside a coconut (!!) You scrape the sides to add more coconut meat to the melange, creating a scrumptious and multi-dimensional dish. Be aware that it's quite filling from all the coconut; that it's incredibly delicious and difficult to stop eating :x\n\n(+++) Green Curry Duck ($11.35): The green curry has the same aromatic coconuty tones, with more depth and savoriness compared to the red curry. We were also impressed by the seemingly endless chunks of meaty, juicy duck slices. \n\n(++) Ped Yang ($10.75): Same great boneless duck, served another way. Being accustomed to crispy roast duck, the syrupy-saucey version took a bit of getting used to. I grew to like the interesting paradox of such a thick sauce with such light flavor that physically smothered yet subtly augmented the taste of the duck. \n\n(++) Thai Rib ($10.55): A curry version of galbi. I don't know about the texture of the ribs, which were charboiled to very dry, almost like jerky. It's still quite good considering it's covered in the creamy red curry sauce for balance; just don't be expecting fall-off-the-bone braised ribs.\n\n(++) Pad Sai Roong ($9.70): There's something about the surface area and texture of the thin silver noodles that has a lighter mouthfeel than carby rice noodles, and Thai Time does it just right with a light soy sauce and a bucketload of assorted vegetables and shrimp.\n\nPortions are ginormous, but I suggest ordering more and taking home leftovers so that you can try different dishes. Not only are the portion sizes decently sized; the generous amounts of duck/seafood essentially make all other restaurants in SF look stingy.\n\nOther tips:\n*This is totally a raving review, but be careful not to hike up unrealistic expectations only to get disappointed.\n*Take-out available.

But do consider coming in up to 4, so that you can try more dishes.

Such a wonderful day to take a drive to the City and soak in the sun. My girls wanted to hit the Exploratorium. And we were hungry for lunch. After writing 13 reviews - yes, I'm just a Yelp beginner, folks - I thought , alright, I'm going to put Yelp to work finally and find good Thai. This literal \"hole in the wall\" turned up as one of three Thai restaurants in the City with a 4.5 rating. (No 5 rating places, by the way.) We actually tried to go to one of the \"other\" 4.5 places right around the corner on Geary, but lucky for us, it was closed. Thai Time did not disappoint! No way! Great stuff here folks!\n\nUpon walking through the door, the first thing I thought was - oooh, wow, pretty small. I think my master bedroom is bigger than the dining area! My wife counted enough seats for, hmmm, maybe 26 \"small\" patrons. Luckily I'm one of those small patrons - yah, right! Hah! Do I 'eat to live', or do I 'live to eat'? Uhhhhh, hmmmm, I think the latter! Don't let the small surroundings scare you away, 'cause it'll be your loss!\n\nOkay, time to order. The soft-spoken server made several recommendations, almost all of them seafood (I think they might specialize in seafood). But my family wasn't in the mood for seafood today, so we tried the following:\n\n- Satay (chicken), as an appetizer\n- Tofu Tod, as an appetizer\n- Gang Dang (beef), as an entree\n- Gang Garee Gai, as an entree\n- Moo Yang, as an entree\n\nDelightful food! The Satay was solid in taste. My little one loved it, so I think it was right on the money. The tofu was also very good, cut in a smaller, triangular 3-dimensional shape than you're used to in other Thai restaurants, and we counted this as yet another plus, because they were bite-size for the kids. Delightful appetizers!\n\nNow for the entrees. My wife felt strongly that we specify the dishes to be \"mild\", because she believes that you'll find more \"truly\" spiced Thai in the City, as opposed to Thai fare in the burbs. I think she was right. The \"mild\" Gang Dang had a tiny \"kick\" to it, but I didn't mind. I loved it. And, I usually don't like bamboo shoots, but the Gang Dang had the shoots cut thinner than usual, and they complemented my meal fine. The Gang Garee Gai is your typical Yellow Curry Chicken - delicious here at Thai Time. The potatoes, in particular, were cooked well, teaming with the onions and savory yellow sauce to make the chicken dance on your taste buds. And the Moo Yang was great too - your typical honey-grilled-pork, but satisfying with every bite. Delightful entrees!\n\nUhhhh, we're not done yet! There's dessert too. The sticky rice and mango was just right. Outside of the Philippines, I seldom eat mangoes, but the one on the plate today was sweet and enjoyable for me. We also had the peculiar \"Roti\". I was curious about this, 'cause I thought Roti was Indian, not Thai. The server returned with the Roti, explaining that this was their \"Thai\" version, and what a yummy dessert it was! Thin, moist yet crispy (on the edges) bread, covered with condensed milk and sugar. Wow! Delightful desserts!\n\nIn the end, I give Thai Time 4.5 STARS. Wonderful Thai food. Attentive service. Much better than my usual \"burb\" Thai cuisine, but then again, this is City Thai, right? Whenever I'm back in the area, I'll definitely return to sample something new from their extensive menu.

Delivery guys were very nice and professional.\n\nThe Food:\nThai Time Combo ($10.95)- This was probably my least favourite dish. It is A LOT of fried food and I am not that into fried food. When I say a lot, I mean a ton of fried tofu, 2 huge egg roll, 2 big fried prawn, 4 huge fish cake and 2 of Garee Puff. Out of all these appetizer I would say the Garee Puff and the Fried Shrimp are the best.\n\nKao Pad Kra Prow ($7.95)- By my standards, this is good for the price. You get a HUGE portion, I got pork and there was meat in every bite. I didn't taste a lot of that typical grilled flavour I like in Thai fried rice, but it was fine. The bell peppers and onions were fresh and not overcooked.\n\nGang Keaw Pla Guy($7.95)- This was my favourite dish of them all.

The curry didn't have bitter taste, nor was it too salty. Great creamy taste, not oily at all.\n\nPumpkin Talay($9.75)- This is the sautee dish, not the curry. This was quite delicious. I never thought about pumpkin and seafood together but this dish balanced the two well. The pumpkin was cooked to perfection, and again, so much seafood I was not disappointed. Just so you know, the scallops in this dish are the baby scallops, not the huge ones which I think makes for a better dish because all the pieces are bite-sized.\n\nI will definitely order again if they will deliver to me :)", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-07-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Still feel the same as in my previous review, except I just wanted to comment that the Beef Nam Toke and Gang Keaw Pla Guy are pretty good here too.

Such a wonderful day to take a drive to the City and soak in the sun. My girls wanted to hit the Exploratorium. And we were hungry for lunch. After writing 13 reviews - yes, I'm just a Yelp beginner, folks - I thought , alright, I'm going to put Yelp to work finally and find good Thai. This literal \"hole in the wall\" turned up as one of three Thai restaurants in the City with a 4.5 rating. (No 5 rating places, by the way.) We actually tried to go to one of the \"other\" 4.5 places right around the corner on Geary, but lucky for us, it was closed. Thai Time did not disappoint! No way! Great stuff here folks!\n\nUpon walking through the door, the first thing I thought was - oooh, wow, pretty small. I think my master bedroom is bigger than the dining area! My wife counted enough seats for, hmmm, maybe 26 \"small\" patrons. Luckily I'm one of those small patrons - yah, right! Hah! Do I 'eat to live', or do I 'live to eat'? Uhhhhh, hmmmm, I think the latter! Don't let the small surroundings scare you away, 'cause it'll be your loss!\n\nOkay, time to order. The soft-spoken server made several recommendations, almost all of them seafood (I think they might specialize in seafood). But my family wasn't in the mood for seafood today, so we tried the following:\n\n- Satay (chicken), as an appetizer\n- Tofu Tod, as an appetizer\n- Gang Dang (beef), as an entree\n- Gang Garee Gai, as an entree\n- Moo Yang, as an entree\n\nDelightful food! The Satay was solid in taste. My little one loved it, so I think it was right on the money. The tofu was also very good, cut in a smaller, triangular 3-dimensional shape than you're used to in other Thai restaurants, and we counted this as yet another plus, because they were bite-size for the kids. Delightful appetizers!\n\nNow for the entrees. My wife felt strongly that we specify the dishes to be \"mild\", because she believes that you'll find more \"truly\" spiced Thai in the City, as opposed to Thai fare in the burbs. I think she was right. The \"mild\" Gang Dang had a tiny \"kick\" to it, but I didn't mind. I loved it. And, I usually don't like bamboo shoots, but the Gang Dang had the shoots cut thinner than usual, and they complemented my meal fine. The Gang Garee Gai is your typical Yellow Curry Chicken - delicious here at Thai Time. The potatoes, in particular, were cooked well, teaming with the onions and savory yellow sauce to make the chicken dance on your taste buds. And the Moo Yang was great too - your typical honey-grilled-pork, but satisfying with every bite. Delightful entrees!\n\nUhhhh, we're not done yet! There's dessert too. The sticky rice and mango was just right. Outside of the Philippines, I seldom eat mangoes, but the one on the plate today was sweet and enjoyable for me. We also had the peculiar \"Roti\". I was curious about this, 'cause I thought Roti was Indian, not Thai. The server returned with the Roti, explaining that this was their \"Thai\" version, and what a yummy dessert it was! Thin, moist yet crispy (on the edges) bread, covered with condensed milk and sugar. Wow! Delightful desserts!\n\nIn the end, I give Thai Time 4.5 STARS. Wonderful Thai food. Attentive service. Much better than my usual \"burb\" Thai cuisine, but then again, this is City Thai, right? Whenever I'm back in the area, I'll definitely return to sample something new from their extensive menu.

Luckily, Thai Time did not disappoint; the prices were completely reasonable, the ingredients were fresh, and the restaurant itself is so small and kitschy (admittedly a potential turnoff for some, but an atmospheric positive in my estimation) that it gives off a distinct SF vibe.\n\nEverything we ate was delicious, but I want to shine a light on the Green Rotee.
