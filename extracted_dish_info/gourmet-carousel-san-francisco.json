Forgot, I guess. \nI've been going here for years, but not often enough, and not recently.\nI guess I always go with exactly 9 people and get a banquet-table and really pig out.  Do any of you other bok-goi's notice that Chinese people almost always eat out with a crowd?\n\nStart with the negative: It's a creepy-awful room.  Who needs windows?  Wood paneling.  Bad lighting.  Picture the spawn of a basement rec-room and a dentist office waiting room.  OK...it's darker than most of those flourescent-and-formica places, which is a good thing, but the place just feels claustrophobic.\n\nSo the other night I had 10 friends and neighbors down at my house. I said \"Chinese Banquet!\" but a couple people didn't want to go out, so I ordered take out (they don't deliver, unfortunately).  Also, there were a couple \"vegetarians\" who eat seafood. (RANT) What's up with that?  Are chickens smarter than salmon?  Do fish feel no pain?  Can you hear me screaming if I'm underwater? (/ RANT)\n\nSo we got a boatload of GOOD food for $107. Divide by 11 and you'll still be under the magic number of $10/person.  And we had Peking duck, garlic-scallion crab, abalone, a clay pot dish, Snow pea sprouts with garlic, seafood chow fun, and about 5 other things, and we had leftovers.  Dungeness crab for dinner tonight!\nThe killer is that everything was really good. OK, the salt 'n pepper squid suffered a bit from the 15 minute drive home, but we ate really well, especially considering the pittance we spent.  My friends and neighbors all raved!   \nAnd were were completely free of anything resembling cashew chicken, Mongolian lamb, or sweet and sour pork.  \n\nHow to eat well:\n1. Call 9 friends \n2. go to Gourmet Carousel\n3. order extravagantly\n4. eat like a king\n5. split the bill\n6.
