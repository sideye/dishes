We stopped by on Thursday, July 28th around 7:45pm. There were three of us and we managed to snag two bar seats next to the door. About 10-15 mins later, a third seat opened up.\n\n*Luck: tequila blanco, banana, lychee tea, lime ($13)\n*Wealth: scotch, rye, cardamaro, lapsang tea, apple ($13)\n*Glenrothes: Dealer's choice ($13)\n\nThere was only one scotch/rye/whiskey cocktail on the menu and my friend ordered it, so I asked the bartender to make me something dark and boozy, but not too sweet. He ended up making me a Bobby Burns. I've only had this cocktail one other time recently and the rendition here was more my style. Not as light and sweet.\n\n*Munchies: pickles, jerky, nuts ($8)\n*Wontons: Monterey bay squid, pork, garlic, chives ($8)\n*BBQ Pork Buns: char siu, pork floss ($8)\n\nSince this was our third stop, we decided to order some small plates. The wontons were my favorite out of the dishes we ordered. I don't normally like squid ink, but it gave the dish an earthiness that I didn't mind. The chat siu baos kind of reminded me of pineapple buns and had a hint of sweetness I didn't prefer. (I'm not a big fan of sweet and savory together.) The bun itself is really thin and flaky, so you may be disappointed if you like thick breaded baos. But I liked it since I don't like a lot of bread.\n\nThe Munchies were really just small little snacks. We actually got four items since they also gave us some kind of chip snack which wasn't listed on the menu. The snacks were okay, but it was weird seeing items that are normally paired with some kind of protein served as snacks. I felt like the meat was missing. When eating the nuts, I thought, where are the prawns to make the walnut prawn dish? And with the chips. Where was the chicken for the chips to sit on top of? And the pickled veggies reminded me of the free appetizer plate that sits on top of the lazy susan at family dinners. Other than the jerky, which was a tiny portion, most of the munchies felt like leftover items from other dishes.\n\nThe bar atmosphere of Mister Jiu's is dark. Kind of like a secret, down low bar. I only wish they closed the front door, as it ruined the ambience a little for me. And it made the bar cold with the wind blowing in. I was a little uncomfortable and cold sitting there. From the bar, I did spy a huge window in the dining room. I never went over to look, but I'd love to come back for an actual meal. It looked like a completely different feel back there.

Grilled, saut\u00e9ed, raw - the wonders of the scallion are on full display at Mister Jiu's, the brainchild of rising chef Brandon Jew.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Mister Jiu's, then you probably don't know that the restaurant has racked up the accolades in its first two years of operation: the restaurant received one star in the latest Michelin guide; it was voted as the #3 best new restaurant by Bon Appetit in 2017; and it was recently featured on an episode of David Chang's food documentary 'Ugly Delicious.'  Given this pedigree, expectations were high, and the restaurant somewhat lived up to the hype.\n\nJew's cuisine reimagines Chinese American staples by drawing upon quality California ingredients and traditional Chinese cooking techniques.  My friend and I ordered the uni cheong fun (rice roll), sizzling rice soup, hodo skin tofu, fava beans, wonton and squid, sizzling black cod, and jian dui (sesame ball).  Things I expected to like were underwhelming in their conventionality.  The uni cheong fun ($16), for instance, featured nicely steamed rice noodle with a generous portion of uni atop each roll.  But, the buttery texture of the uni blended with the softness of the rice noodle. And, a more even distribution of uni would have improved the dish.  Likewise, the wonton with squid ($22) seemed like it would offer a unique take by stuffing wonton skins with squid, but instead featured nicely grilled squid alongside pork wontons dyed black with squid ink.  It was good, but nothing revolutionary in terms of flavor or texture.  The standouts of our meal were undoubtedly the hodo skin tofu ($18), the sizzling black cod ($32), and the fava beans ($16).  Both the hodo skin tofu and fava beans were unique in that they transformed simple items - tofu and beans - into substantive dishes that rivaled their meatier counterparts in terms of flavor and texture. \n\nAs one would expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant, service was good.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and clearly pointed out how they could accommodate by dairy and peanut allergies.  Yet, my friend and I noticed how his personality seemed to warm up as the night wore on; although a little standoffish at first, he eventually started cracking jokes and making quips to us and adjacent tables.    Otherwise, the kitchen was a little slower than expected with certain dishes that seemingly did not require lengthy cooking times, but the relaxed pace ensured that we didn't overeat.\n\nYour enjoyment of Mister Jiu's will likely depend on your answer to the following questions: are these dishes still worthwhile even if they do not improve upon the original?

They don't serve food till 5:30 but I was more than happy to indulge in a nice cocktail. In case you're wondering, Prosperity has a yin yang symbol made with the egg white foam although thankfully the texture wasn't too creamy and had a wonderful earthiness from the lotus root.  \n\nWe had a pretty average appetite and although the server recommended 3 dishes per person, we went with 5 fairly light ones plus 1 dessert.

A close second is the (2) prawn toast which was chocked full with shrimp flavor (via real shrimp pieces) in a somewhat dense but not greasy piece of bread. The roe topping was a winner. Other dishes were cheeky in their play on traditional Chinese dimsum but not worth a repeat unless it was a filler -- things like the (3) Dungeness crab cheung fun and the (4) Dutch Crunch BBQ pork buns just didn't match up to their traditional counterparts. Finally I would not order the (5) ma po Tofu with ribeye steak again as it tasted more like spicy BBQ chili meat than the true fermented bean taste. For dessert we got the whipped honey which was like honey sorbet with fruit and thin crisps of white chocolate and caramelized sugar (or honey). It was a nice, light way to round out the meal. \n\nTotal cost was $65pp after tax and surcharge.\n\nOverall, Mister Jiu's has tasty cocktails and some really stellar fusion dishes.

So I doubled up my uni in a bite and left some of the rice/fun on the plate, and it was perfect. The texture of the rice noodle is the right combination of silkiness and bite.

I liked the twist, and would recommend ordering these.\n\nOrange Chicken Wings:\nWe received around seven wings, and they were reasonable.  I was expecting a heavier cross of chicken wings with orange chicken, which it wasn't.  They were a bit more like a normal wing (imagine San Tung, less sauce).\n\nOxtail Soup:\nI really liked the soup.  The flavor was quite dense, but the meat felt lighter, which presented a nice contrast.  I would get this again.\n\nBroccoli Romanesco:\nThis dish was great.

The quail was underdone, and the sticky rice... I have *never* had crunchy sticky rice before.  Given the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this dish, and was extremely disappointed.  We told our server, who took it back; she told us that the chef said it was the special brine they use. Sir, unless you brine your quail in week-old blood, it was not the brine.  Paired with the fact I had to grind through the rice grains, I assume the kitchen had made a mistake with the timing on this one.  Sad.\n\nLiberty Farm Roast Duck (half):\nThis was fun!  Tortilla-like wrap, confit duck leg, crispy skin, cucumber and various condiments (duck liver mousse!), and no complaints.  I loved everything about this dish, and definitely recommend it.  The portion size is generous, and everything was cooked perfectly.  My only regret is that we'd already ordered so much, and I was getting extremely full (even after setting-aside portions throughout our meal) so I couldn't eat it all.\n\nBlack Sesame Cake:\nThis.  My approach to this cake will be like that of SPQR's tiramisu.  I will detour to drop in and order this from the bar if possible.  The cake is perfect; the ginger mousse, black sesame, asian pear topping are all perfect.  Get this.\n\nDan Ta:\nCrispy bruleed top, light filling, this was great.

The snacks were okay, but it was weird seeing items that are normally paired with some kind of protein served as snacks. I felt like the meat was missing. When eating the nuts, I thought, where are the prawns to make the walnut prawn dish? And with the chips. Where was the chicken for the chips to sit on top of? And the pickled veggies reminded me of the free appetizer plate that sits on top of the lazy susan at family dinners. Other than the jerky, which was a tiny portion, most of the munchies felt like leftover items from other dishes.\n\nThe bar atmosphere of Mister Jiu's is dark. Kind of like a secret, down low bar.

I'm a first generation Chinese woman and literally grew up eating Chinese food almost every day. How good could this upscale and overpriced Chinese food be? I was sure that the the food at Mister Jiu's would be, what the Cantonese would say - \u8cb4\u683c\u5514\u98fd (expensive yet not filling) and \u5443\u9b3c\u8001 (tricking the Westerners). However, I am happy to report that I actually had a great experience and meal during my visit!\n\nIronically, Mister Jiu's is located right in the middle of San Francisco's grungy Chinatown. My friends and I had reservations prior and were seated promptly. The wait staff had a good understanding of their menu items and were generally attentive. At about $13, the cocktails are average-priced for San Francisco standards. I opted for the Prosperity for the first round and the Happiness towards the end of my meal. The cocktails were good but if you're looking for more than a light buzz, you may have to opt for some of the heavier drinks.\n\nFood-wise, we ordered Crispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes, Fermented Cabbage, Tendrils, Greens and Stems, Wontons, Steak Fried Rice, and half of the Liberty Farm Roast Duck, and two of the desserts to share between four people. Portion sizes are definitely on the small side but I dined with three other girls with smaller appetites so the amount we ordered we sufficient and we were all able to walk away feeling satisfied. \n\nOut of the the items we ordered, my favorite was the turnip cake and the roast duck. The tendrils were also fantastic but for the price we paid, I could have gotten something very similar  (taste-wise) at a local Cantonese restaurant for half the price. The portion would probably be at least doubled as well. The tendrils are topped with a small dollop of uni sauce but I'm not sure that it did much for the dish.\n\nThe turnip cake was perfectly crispy and topped with a slightly tangy mushroom ragout of sorts. I think it may have been vegetarian but I could imagine how much tastier this would have been if they stayed a bit more traditional with it and added the Chinese sausage. \n\nFinally, the main attraction - at $60 for \"half\" of the roast duck, I was expecting it to be the best damn roast duck I've ever had. Was it? No - it wasn't the best roast duck I've ever had but it was still very, very tasty. However, I loved this dish because I feel like it was truly an elevated version of classic Chinese food. Since they use duck breast, most of the fat was able to be rendered out which allowed the skin to become nice and crispy. The other classic sides were included (cilantro, cucumbers, green onions, duck jus, and a homemade peanut hoisin sauce) but my favorite addition to this was the duck liver pat\u00e9. I generally love pat\u00e9 and thought that this worked very well with the other elements of the dish. There was even dollops of plum jam on top of the pat\u00e9, which paired well with both the pat\u00e9 and roast duck. \n\nAll in all, Master Jiu's definitely surpassed my expectations.

The shrimp toast was good, though quite small if you're sharing. The wontons with squid were a good pick, but I think they needed a tad more of the spicy sauce (I got some of the black vinegar that comes with the potstickers which helped). The true star of the meal was the absolutely phenomenal duck, which was just so, so good! And good for two, and worth the $65 price tag. The peanut butter hoisin is great, the herbs, and the amazing duck liver mousse too. I love the mix of perfectly roasted duck breast (still rare) and the confit leg. Truly exceptional. My only gripe is that for a dish with that price tag, I found it cheap that they charge you $1 extra per wrapper/tortilla that you order beyond the initial basket they give you. It's already an expensive dish, and it seems unnecessarily cheap for something that isn't super expensive to make, and not what I'd expect from a Michelin starred place. As for dessert, the rhubarb tart was good, but the whipped honey is really lovely and unexpectedly so. I like heavier desserts but this was really excellent and worth getting. Service was really good.

My boyfriend and I came to SF for a little mini vacation, and in doing so I stumbled upon this place while finalizing some airbnb plans. I believe booking even almost a month ahead on a Saturday I was able to reserve something a little late in the evening (945 pm). Most places such as these either have a tasting menu or the idea really is like tapas/small plates. With that said I still feel like the price range here on Yelp for this place over exaggerates it a bit ... or maybe I'm just use to the bougie scene in LA where even non Michelin Star restaurants have the audacity to charge around the same price :P  My boyfriend and I were told that 6-7 plates would suffice for 2 people which of course can definitely add up.\nThe items my boyfriend and I ordered were the following:\n- Prawn Toast (3.5/5) : lovely presentation; nice opening to our meal\n- Sea Urchin Cheong Fun (4.5/5) : possibly my favorite item; I'm a sucker for uni; the sauce was deliciously tangy and slightly sweet; the rice noodle rap was a little thicker than I'm use but still okay; but that decadence of uni ... ugh we should've ordered two\n- Hot and Sour Soup (4/5) : emphasis on hot; it wasn't necessarily a spicy taste but a nice warming sensation (different from just the temperature if that makes sense) with each sip\n- Wontons (3/5): kind of interchangeable with a 2.5 rating.

It's a lovely mix of old and new. Also, I MUST have the round table with the integrated, seamless lazy susan. I MUST.\n\nYou have the option to choose from two meal sets:\n-3 courses for $45 per person\n-5 courses for $69 per person\n\nPLUS any supplements that range from $40-100. Because it's family style, your entire party needs to agree on the dishes to get and it'll be portioned out to your group size. The portions are very generous so I wouldn't worry about that. We ended up ordering 5 courses plus 1 supplement (none of them desserts), and it was WAY too much food. It was one of the few times I couldn't even force dessert into my belly. My suggestion for you is to either get 3 courses plus 1 supplement (if you REALLY want to try one of the supplements) or get 5 courses but make one of those desserts. It'll be tempting to try everything on the menu but trust me, not stuffing yourself here makes the food taste that much better.\n\nHot and Sour Soup - This is a creative take on the traditional hot and sour soup. The tofu is pre-molded into the bowl and they pour the soup into each bowl tableside. The broth has the same tart flavors, but they didn't thicken it with cornstarch so it has the consistency of a more regular broth. I liked it.\n\nSquid and Pork Wontons - One of my favorite dishes of the night. The dumpling skin is made from squid ink so it comes out black. It's also squid because you get squid with the dumplings. This dish also had a slightly tart, citrusy flavor.\n\nCheong Fun (Rice Noodle Roll) - Even though the caviar and salmon roe seems to be the most appealing aspect of this dish on paper, the actual rice noodles are the star. They're very thick and tightly wound so you get a nice big bite from it. I actually don't think the eggs add as much to the overall flavor as the sauce did. Also slightly tart. \n\nRoasted Quail - Stuffed quail is one of those dishes that you usually have to pre-order at Chinese restaurants so it was nice to get to eat this. There was a slight bitter finish at the end of each bite, and I couldn't pinpoint the source (whether it was from the meat or the sauce). It wasn't of serious concern but we mentioned it to our server anyway and they basically had a discussion in the kitchen as to what it could've been. There was still not real conclusion since the bitterness wasn't intended but I appreciated the effort on their part. That can easily be offset by taking a bite of the fig anyway.\n\nBraised Beef Tongue, Brisket and Short Rib Clay Pot - This was so good! It comes with rice (thank god) because the sauce is so good, you just need rice to soak it all up with. I like how each pot has different pieces of beef so you really do get a variety of textures.\n\nTea-Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - This is their version of peking duck, and something I had to order because it's one of my favorite dishes. I like that they serve it with pancakes (instead of mantou - steamed buns) because that's how it's done in China! Plus pancakes add a pleasant chewy texture. One of those in our group did want the mantou so they gladly brought out a few for him. What's most different about their version is that you get duck pate, in addition to the hoisin and peanut sauce, to smear onto the pancakes. It adds a really rich flavor and creaminess that isn't overpowering. You also get a few pieces of chopped liver that we just ate on the side. It didn't really make sense to include it in the wrap. While I liked some parts of this, it cost a whopping $50 for half a duck so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're dying to try it. This is one dish where I prefer the traditional version just because of the ultra-crispy, sweetly-glazed skin.\n\nI would be interested to see what older Chinese folks think of the food here.

I enjoyed the experience but wasn't really impressed by it. So, I'm going to say it was just ok. Here's why. \n\nMy GF and I arrived early when the bar was open but b4 the dining room was. My GF ordered the \"Luck\" cocktail and I had a martini. Took a sip of the cocktail; didn't like it but I'm not a cocktail drinker. My martini was ok; served very dry and cold but they didn't have my favorite gin and olives were too small for my taste. Also didn't like that they required you to close the bar bill (and didn't add it to the dinner tab) b4 being seated.  \n\nThe dining room was very nicely decorated in a modern style that reminded me of Miyamoto's in Napa.  I was particularly interested in the space because my wedding party was held there over 40 years ago when it was upper banquet floor the Four Seas Restaurant.  Didn't look the same, of course.\n\nWe were seated at a very nice but very small table next to the window overlooking Grant Ave; probably one of the 2 best tables (in terms of view) in the house; there was a similar table located at the other end of the room. \n\nWe didn't like the offerings in the tasting menu ($69/person) and decided to order ala carte because we didn't like choices on the tasting menu.  Another reason to order ala carte is that we both had to order the same thing; one could not choose the halibut and the other the quail for the final course.  We wanted to try both of these dishes, so the tasting menu wasn't an option for us for that reason alone.\n\nFor the opening courses, we ordered the prawn toast, the headcheese the won ton w/calamari.  Didn't care for the shrimp toast at all.  It was pretty to look at but it I just got toast and no taste of shrimp at all.  On the other hand we both liked the headcheese and won ton dishes.  The headcheese was sliced paper thin and was delicious but the dish didn't need the thin pieces of amaranth bread that topped and hid the headcheese on presentation.  The won ton skins were blackened w/squid ink and filed w/what tasted like a pretty standard pork mixture and that sat on a spicy bed of sauteed calamari.  Liked the concept and presentation but didn't find the taste all that memorable.\n\nFor the main dishes we ordered the squash, the halibut and the quail.  Loved the halibut, the other 2 dishes not so much.  The halibut (a very large piece) was perfectly cooked and was flaky and tender; it also wasn't overwhelmed by other flavors; the fish was the star.  Excellent!  \n\nUnfortunately the quail stuffed w/\"new my fon\" (the kind of mixed meat/veggie/spice flavored short grain rice that you often get for dim sum served in a banana leaf) unfortunately was overcooked; the quail was tough and the rice a bit mushy.  The flattened presentation of the quail however was very good.  The squash was served w/a topping of lop cheong, dried scallops, bonito flakes and xo sauce.  It was ok but nothing really outstanding about it.  We were also comped a bowl of the \"egg drop soup, which was a nice gesture; The soup was delicious with the sweet taste of fresh corn but it was more like a chowder than egg drop.\n\nLastly, we had the 2014 Pere Mata Cava Rosado \"Trepat\" sparkling wine w/dinner.  I like having sparkling wine w/dinner when I dine out at expensive places but they didn't have any that I was particularly drawn to.  \n\nOnly ordered the cava because it was the cheapest at $56/bottle.  It was ok but it was a rose, which I don't usually order, and came w/a screw top so the \"fun\" of hearing the cork pop was lost. They also didn't place the wine in an ice bucket next to the table.  Instead opting to recap the bottle and hold it in a wine cooler somewhere to serve as necessary. I would have preferred the traditional service approach for the sparkling wine \n\nTotal cost of the meal w/o the wine was $130.  About the same as it would have cost for the tasting menu but, as I mentioned, I think the tasting menu choices were too limited.  Don't care how great others way the turnip cake was, it's just turnip cake and I don't like turnip cake all that much to begin with.  Same for the cheong fun.  It's a very common dish;dressing it up doesn't make it any more interesting. Baked BBQ buns and fried rice also aren't things I care to eat. And the tendrils (pea shoots?) vs squash was a push.\n\nTotal cost of the bill w/drinks was almost $290 including tax, tip and the SF surcharge.  Would have been better to just skip the drinks which cost about $100 and focus on the food which is what I'd suggest others do.  Would recommend, the egg drop soup, headcheese and halibut. The won ton was just ok but worth a try.  Would pass on the prawn toast and squash but would give the quail another try and hope for better.\n\nOverall, it was an ok experience but can't say that I'm a fan.

The sesame on the outside was awesome and then your tongue is left with a subtle saltiness that wasn't overbearing. \n\n2. Pickles - included a large variety and even though I'm not a fan of pickles, we cleaned this dish right up!\n\n3. Chilled Beef Tendon - was another thing that I would NEVER order, but the chilled beef tendon sounded pretty gnarly so we gave it a go. They said something about it being braised for 48 hours and you could really taste the deep flavors. It was such a cool take on tendon and I ate all of it! I don't even like tendon!!!!!!!! Picture has been uploaded. \n\n4. Dry Aged Beef Tartare - was OK. Now I love tartare, but had a feel this wasn't a place to get it at. Also, there were no pictures of the tartare so check my photos for that. This dish was decent, but forgetful compared to the rest. The flavors were not as strong or complimentary, but the beef was of great quality.\n\n5. Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns - gifted from the Chef and we loved these. They tasted like chocolate chip eggo waffles with bbq pork inside! Sweet but definitely salty and savory. Awesome combo!!!! Great crunch/crisp to them too.\n\n6. Mapo tofu - this was FLIPPEN RIDIC. Such great flavors with a good kick to it. Lots of chili oil so stay away if you can't hang. Now, I usually complain about salty foods, but I was NOT complaining about this one! Get it with a side of rice cause dis stuff is SAUCEY. \n\n7. Smoked Hodo Tofu - this, unfortunately, was the loser of the night for us. It was the one dish that my buddy and I honestly just could not eat. We picked at the the tofu and eggplant, both of which we were not into. This ended up being packed up and taken home for my roomies. In comparison to everything else, this one just had to lose. They couldn't ALL be winners! (???right?????)\n\n8. Steak Fried Rice - this dish was yummy and a good rice dish if you don't want to stick to plain white rice. However, I wouldn't order this again. It was delicious--don't get me wrong, I just feel like I would be happier getting something else off that menu. Maybe I will try the noodles next time!\n\n9. Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - AMAZING! FREAKING AMAZING DUCK. Best duck I've ever had. However, I was PISSED that it came out last because I was so darn full by then!!! LOL. Mind you everything listed here was shared between two people!! This definitely was the most delicious duck I've ever had since I've gotten back from Paris. The next time I come back, I'm going to request I get the duck first!!!\n\n10. Black Sesame Cake - Too much ginger :(. Not sweet subtle ginger either but a PUNCH YOU IN DA FACE ginger. \n\nOverall a great experience and I would love to come back and have my duck first!

"], "author": "Tiffany L.", "review": "This is a one-of-a-kind New Chinese restaurant in SF that's done right. I'm all for traditional Chinese food, and when there's a spin to it, I do get a little skeptical. But this one's a showstopper. The menu is entirely thought out, and a lot of their ingredients from the lap cheong (Chinese sausage) to the hoisin sauce is made in house. l love the concept of a banquet style menu because it makes me feel like I'm eating with family and brings communion regardless of who you're dining with. \n\n Drinks - Drinks are on point! We had \"Wisdom\" and \"Wealth\"; both drinks were delicious. \"Wealth\" had a smooth smokey finish to the scotch, infused from the lapsang tea. \"Wisdom\" was refreshing with use of all the right flavors from the passion fruit and lemongrass.\n\nCrispy Daikon Cake - It's hard to perfect this dim sum dish, but it had been done.  Usually restaurants skimp out on the daikon and put starchy fillers in place.  These cakes were filled with huge chunks of daikon, fried, and slightly drizzled with a shiitake mushrooms sauce, finished with fresh radishes. One of the best daikon cakes I've had in SF.\n\nSizzling Rice Soup - the BROTH was amazing.  I could probably drink an entire vat of this. This is a chicken consomme, with enough crunch from the water chestnuts, asparagus (which I thought would be a little weird, since I haven't seen this veggie in any traditional Chinese soups, but complimented really well), green garlic drizzled oil, and of course sizzling rice. I would say this is one of my favorite dishes. \n\nDungeness Crab Custard - The unique creativity of this dish attracted my attention.  This dish was made from the brains/guts of the crab, which I usually don't eat because it tastes weird and very fatty.  The texture of the custard was very light (like chawanmushi) but you can definitely feel the fat from the brains fill your appetite. The citrus juice didn't really cut the fat - what I really wanted was a bowl of rice to eat this with. There was a generous portion of crab meat that sat on top of the custard. I like the concept, of this dish, but it was a tad too heavy for my appetite.\n\nGlass Noodles - The majority of my table's favorite dish of the night. The glass noodles aren't your traditional thin translucent noodles.  These noodles were thick and chewy, tossed with sesame oil, peanut, and beef tendon.  This dish was a hit at the table.  This dish reminded me of a take on Szechuan flavors without that pepper corn linger that numbs your lips at the end. \n\nSteamed Alaskan Halibut - This is a classic dish, taken up a notch. It was very clean and the cut of the halibut was favorable. Nicely flavored with the shiitake broth and smoked oyster sauce.\n\nRoasted Quail - Who doesn't like a bird stuffed with homemade lap cheong and sticky rice! Beautiful dish, executed so well. The combination of the flavors from each component worked in sync with each other. Another favorite dish of the night and a must try!\n\nLion's Head - I underestimated this dish, until it rested in my mouth. This is my number one dish of the night! Moist pork meatball, sitting in a broth with fermented mustard greens.  Every component of his dish was rich in flavor and combined together - gastronomical. This is a MUST try.\n\nTea-Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - This was kind of a French take on \"Peking Duck\".  Delicious duck breast and confit leg.  This protein was accompanied with a scallion style pancake and hoisin sauce.  The concept of eating duck with the scallion style pancake was different and interesting.  The pancake kind of reminded me of a tortilla, and I was hoping for it to compliment the duck a little more.  Hoisin sauce was delicious and the duck was seasoned and cooked really well.\n\nChocolate Dessert - This beautifully plated dessert came with a candle for our friend's birthday.  The pastry chef's here really know what they're doing. I couldn't get enough of the chocolate caramel with red bean, and I wish there was more. The flavors didn't seem complex from the menu, but the finished plate left me wanting more.\n\nYes, the price is steep for Chinese food, but the creativity and craftsmanship in each dish was worth it. The combination of new and traditional Chinese concepts really came together and opened my eyes to this modern movement in Chinese cuisine.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["5) Crispy Daikon Cake\nDelicious, but nothing novel.

An explosion of flavor follows each bite, and the savory stuffed rice perfectly balances out the sweetness of the quail. \n\n4) Chilled Beef Tendon\nA simple, well-cooked dish. More faithful to original Chinese style, which might be refreshing to some. Not one of their iconic dishes.\n\n5) Crispy Daikon Cake\nDelicious, but nothing novel. Doesn't taste or feel much different than the turnip cakes you'd find in a delicious hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.\n\n6) Hot and Sour Soup\nInteresting take on a classic. Does not really taste like hot and sour soup, with a heavier emphasis on cilantro + soy sauce flavors compared to the traditional flavors. Fun if you're trying something new, but not life-changing.\n\n7) Smoked Hodo Tofu\nThis is the one dish I do NOT recommend. I don't think I quite understood concept behind this dish.

This spot is a bit closer to traditional Chinese cuisine-- focusing on only one regional cuisine (Cantonese), and using familiar presentation (e.g. BBQ pork buns or cheong fun (rice noodles)). Like China Live, the waitstaff is extremely racially diverse. Patrons were mostly non-Asian, though there were some Americanized Asians in the mix as well (being one myself). The views out of the windows were very reminiscent of NYC-- brick building facades.\n\nThe uni cheong fun (I noticed both waiters said this with the proper Cantonese intonation-- or as close as one might get) was tasty, if a bit soft. First, I tried the entire thing-- uni plus cheong fun, in one bite. The delicate flavor of the uni was entirely masked by the dense cheong fun. Next, I tried them separate. The uni was buttery and slightly salty, unlike sweeter uni I've had at Japanese spots-- I understand this was probably to match the savoriness of the dish. The cheong fun was limp and very moist. The soy sauce had orange and sesame oil in it (waitress told me that), but I really only tasted the sourness of the orange oil without any orange flavor. The sourness was a good contrast to the otherwise buttery and heavier nature of the dish. Arrived at a good temperature, though I wouldn't have complained if it were slightly hotter. 3.75/5\n\nPork buns arrived shortly after the cheong fun, and I had to do some mental calculus to figure out which I should eat first before everything got cold. I bit into the bun and found it to be steaming hot on the inside. Filling-wise, it could have used a bit more meat. When I ate the top independently, it was almost cookie-like in its crunchiness and sweetness. The bun on its own was unsweetened, so when blended together, provided a good level of sweetness. The bun was a bit thin for my tastes, though I admired that they were able to get the dough to be thin without falling apart. The bun was a bit dry for my tastes, but I think that went along with the thinness. The pork was only slightly sweet, mostly salted, and wasn't as sugary as other BBQ pork bun fillings I've had in the past. This was one of those dishes where all the ingredients are meant to be eaten in one mouthful. 3.75/5\n\nService was ever present, although there was a bit of pressure to order more (e.g. leaving the menu on the table, strongly recommending a look at the dessert menu). I would totally eat more, but as a single diner, there's only so much stomach room I have! Service was practiced polite (\"hope you have a lovely rest of the week\"-- with some struggle on word order), as opposed to a more heartfelt sort of polite, but I recognize this was one particular waiter only.

Like every bite tasted anew, the rice was a perfect texture, maybe a tad bit heavy on the garlic but who doesn't love garlic, and the steak was super tender, clearly super high quality meat. \n\nDefinitely excited to return and try more dishes, especially the bbq pork buns!", "rating": 4, "date": "2018-07-26"}, {"excerpts": ["Was disappointed by the BBQ pork buns.

Superb location on Waverly in the legendary Four Seas restaurant and banquet hall.\n\nUpon entering, you are thrust into the long, sensual bar space. Beyond this is the light, airy, warm, and welcoming dining room, which when full of patrons radiates a fantastic energy. \n\nLeave your expectations at the door and come here with an open mind. This isn't the place for authenticity, but for creative, innovative takes on Chinese classics using top-notch regional and seasonal ingredients.\n\nThe big winners in my book were the scallion pancake (unlike any I've had before), wontons (maybe the best I've had), choy sum (mustard greens), potstickers (scrumptious), and the quail (perfectly cooked on a bed of delicious crispy and creamy sticky rice).\n\nWas disappointed by the BBQ pork buns. I like the creative touch with the dutch crunch exterior, but the added sugar, and dearth of delicious pork inside, left the dish feeling off. \n\nThe hot and sour soup, while interesting, didn't really strike me as hot and sour soup. Creative? Yes, but more like a delicious tomato soup.\n\nOne of the real strengths of Mister Jiu's is their cocktail program, and they knocked it out of the park with me. Favorites include Wealth and Joy.\n\nService was excellent, and the noise, while on the loud side on this Friday night, was not overwhelming. \n\nI'd come back, but pare down what I order and be pickier.

Came here for a 8:30pm Wednesday date night after trying to get a reservation for 3 months!\n\nVenue / Service: tucked away in a small Chinatown alleyway, Mister Jiu's is quite spacious on the inside.  The kitchen is open too so you can easily watch the chefs working.  Bit dark on the inside, but still loved the modern Asian accents throughout the room (like the chandeliers and large ink painting on the wall) that gave a cozy feeling not typical of some Michelin restaurants.  Service was on the higher end of the scale I've seen- waiters are very attentive and were very helpful in describing dishes and providing recommendations.  \n\nFood: they say 5-7 dishes for 2 people, but I think it depends on which size dishes you get and what you order.  We ended up ordering WAY too much, but will note that they still make some pretty good leftovers for the next few days.  That being said, we loved every dish we had for their more modern take of classic dishes without taking away from the tradition too much.  \n-- Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns (3ea)($11) - loved how the BBQ filling wasn't too sweet but was counterbalanced with the slightly sweet crunchy topping that also added texture to the dish.  Also appreciated how there was more filling vs. dough so you didn't feel carb-heavy.  \n\n-- Sea Urchin Cheong Fun ($16) - this probably was the least impressive of all the dishes we had.  The dish was very simple and clean (just urchin, simple sauce, and rice noodle), but thought there was a LOT of noodle vs. urchin.  Would have helped to have had a crunchy element to the dish since it was overall soft / mushy.  \n\n-- Oxtail Soup (bone marrow, horseradish, dandelion, lotus root)($16) - one of our favorites; much lighter than I expected, but still packed quite a flavor.  The broth almost had a cinnamon aspect to it, but was quite delicious.  Bone marrow was very slight but enough to add more richness to the dish.  I liked how the oxtail was also in smaller, very tender pieces so it was soft, contrasted with the crunchy lotus root.  One serving served 2 of us.  \n\n-- Steak Fried Rice (wagyu skirt, crispy garlic, cured tuna heart)($22) -- another recommendation by the waiter that was a good one!  Should be good for sharing between 3+ people comfortably and 2 people if you order less dishes.  Wagyu was cooked enough that it didn't feel too mushy (which is why I'm not a fan of wagyu) and the tuna heart added a tiny hint of phunk to the dish.  BTW, this is easily reheatable and still tasty if you have leftovers.\n\n-- Liberty Farm Roast Duck (pancakes, peanut butter hoisin, cucumbers)(half for $65) - highly recommended by the waiter, and another good choice!!  Wish we had ordered fewer dishes so we could finish this one completely!  Half of the portion is traditional roasted duck in Peking-style- the fat is beautifully rendered and skin was crispy, just like you would imagine Peking Duck!  They confit the other half, which surprisingly I preferred more than the traditional roast duck; the meat was very tender and I found it to be more flavorful.  Also surprisingly makes good leftovers.\n\nAll in all, we've been dying to come here and we weren't disappointed!  Perhaps ordered too much food for two people but at least we had some tasty leftovers in the end!

I do think the Dungeoness Crab Cheurng Fund ( rice rolls ) was the best I've ever had in America or Asia. The texture of the rice roll is just amazing. The dungeoness crab on top, honestly, I wouldn't really have noticed if it wasn't there. I think it actually might have been better if it was HOT and inside the roll.\n\nThat being said, Mr Jiu's was an extremely enjoyable meal. It was like the classic chinese dishes, only leveled up.\n\nFor example - baked cha siu bao now had a dutch crunch on top, but they were also twice as small as a regular cha siu bao. The cha siu was all pork, and a lot less fat than usual, which I appreciated, but I think these need to have a level of softness to the bun to complement. Nonetheless, good.\n\nSilken Tofu - ribeye mapo. Again, with that delicious silky, melt in your mouth texture, but was it really elevated by using ribeye? I personally don't think so, but it was still very good.\n\nSo I think you get the gist.

I don't usually eat turnip cake, but the way they seared these was amazing and really elevated the dish. \n\nThe nice part of the menu is that each person orders their own entree between the quail and the fish.  It is served along with wagyu beef fried rice and tender green stems, which had an uni cream on top.  The quail was stuffed with sticky rice and was so good.  I just wish I went to town on it and used my hands more to get every last bit of quail.  \n\nFinishing off with the black sesame cake was perfect.  It wasn't too heavy or too sweet.

As part of looking at any Michelin place for Asian food, I look for creativity in the dish and something to intrigue me and Mister Jiu's struck my attention as it seemed to keep the food traditional while offering just a slight enough twist to the entrees to make it interesting. I made a reservation for this spot and for drinks after at one of my favorite speakeasy joints in the city (Bourbon and Branch). This spot is located in Chinatown so parking can be a bit challenging. I ended up taking an uber to avoid the whole search process and showed up for the reservation.\n\nWas greeted promptly at the door and asked to wait a minute as they got set up. The entrance of this joint leads right into a bar with people able to grab food/drinks or just stand for happy hour to enjoy beverages. A few minutes later, was greeted and brought down the long hallway which led to a really open floor dining room. The room had a view into the kitchen so people could see the dishes being made live as they were making its way out of the kitchen and to tables. There were unique cocktails on the menu for around $13 a piece so ordered a few different ones and they all tasted great with a good amount of alcohol in them. After a bit of perusing, decided to order the Devil's gulch pig head, dutch crunch BBQ pork buns, Silken tofu, the steak fried rice, and a large format pork dish.

The buns were good as well but I was honestly so full by that point that it just felt like it was taking up much needed space for the protein. \n\nAll in all, the food and drinks were solid. The service and ambiance is Michelin worthy without a doubt. With all this said, the dishes weren't as unique as I was hoping for and felt just like a slightly enhanced version of Chinese food.

My friend and I didn't have reservations on a Friday night (nothing left online). Thankfully for 2, they had the option of either a high top table. We opted to just stay at the bar. They don't serve food till 5:30 but I was more than happy to indulge in a nice cocktail. In case you're wondering, Prosperity has a yin yang symbol made with the egg white foam although thankfully the texture wasn't too creamy and had a wonderful earthiness from the lotus root.  \n\nWe had a pretty average appetite and although the server recommended 3 dishes per person, we went with 5 fairly light ones plus 1 dessert. The dishes are numbered below so you can keep track. \n\nMy favorite dish was the (1) Szechuan wontons with squid. I would order it again in a heartbeat because I'm a sucker for squid ink pasta and they were heavy handed with the Chinese black vinegar which was the perfect balance to an otherwise spicy, numbing and rich dish. A close second is the (2) prawn toast which was chocked full with shrimp flavor (via real shrimp pieces) in a somewhat dense but not greasy piece of bread. The roe topping was a winner. Other dishes were cheeky in their play on traditional Chinese dimsum but not worth a repeat unless it was a filler -- things like the (3) Dungeness crab cheung fun and the (4) Dutch Crunch BBQ pork buns just didn't match up to their traditional counterparts. Finally I would not order the (5) ma po Tofu with ribeye steak again as it tasted more like spicy BBQ chili meat than the true fermented bean taste. For dessert we got the whipped honey which was like honey sorbet with fruit and thin crisps of white chocolate and caramelized sugar (or honey). It was a nice, light way to round out the meal. \n\nTotal cost was $65pp after tax and surcharge.\n\nOverall, Mister Jiu's has tasty cocktails and some really stellar fusion dishes. Don't expect authenticity but do expect quality ingredients and cooking finesse. I thought it was moderately priced for the caliber of food albeit the servings were small (a $10 bite is literally a bite). I think where it was lacking was service which was friendly but decidedly casual (note I was sitting at the bar) and would be acceptable at any average restaurant.

I can see why people would like them (my wife did), but I tend to enjoy them on the sweeter side, so didn't love these.\n\nCrispy Scarlet Turnip Cakes:\nThe pickled mushrooms on top added a bit of unexpected zest, which was well appreciated.  I liked the twist, and would recommend ordering these.\n\nOrange Chicken Wings:\nWe received around seven wings, and they were reasonable.  I was expecting a heavier cross of chicken wings with orange chicken, which it wasn't.  They were a bit more like a normal wing (imagine San Tung, less sauce).\n\nOxtail Soup:\nI really liked the soup.  The flavor was quite dense, but the meat felt lighter, which presented a nice contrast.  I would get this again.\n\nBroccoli Romanesco:\nThis dish was great.  I don't usually do spicy food, and this had a kick to it, but the flavors were excellent, and there were these little glutenous squares which mixed up the texture.  I would recommend ordering this.\n\nWontons:\nAnother excellent dish.  The texture of the skins were perfect, stuffing was great.  They included some kind of Sichuan peppercorn, which added a kick, but it wasn't overwhelming.  I would get this as well.\n\nRoasted Wolfe Ranch Quail:\nI docked a star for this one.  The quail was underdone, and the sticky rice... I have *never* had crunchy sticky rice before.  Given the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this dish, and was extremely disappointed.  We told our server, who took it back; she told us that the chef said it was the special brine they use. Sir, unless you brine your quail in week-old blood, it was not the brine.  Paired with the fact I had to grind through the rice grains, I assume the kitchen had made a mistake with the timing on this one.  Sad.\n\nLiberty Farm Roast Duck (half):\nThis was fun!  Tortilla-like wrap, confit duck leg, crispy skin, cucumber and various condiments (duck liver mousse!), and no complaints.  I loved everything about this dish, and definitely recommend it.  The portion size is generous, and everything was cooked perfectly.  My only regret is that we'd already ordered so much, and I was getting extremely full (even after setting-aside portions throughout our meal) so I couldn't eat it all.\n\nBlack Sesame Cake:\nThis.  My approach to this cake will be like that of SPQR's tiramisu.  I will detour to drop in and order this from the bar if possible.  The cake is perfect; the ginger mousse, black sesame, asian pear topping are all perfect.  Get this.\n\nDan Ta:\nCrispy bruleed top, light filling, this was great.  I personally like the puff pastry crust, and would love to see that make an appearance here. \n\nService:\nThe service was great.  Our waitress, Sarah, was really attentive; our cups never empty, and our food was well paced.\n\nOverall:\nMy wife and I came here to celebrate our one year anniversary, and the food was good.  We definitely over-ordered, and had a doggy-bag of leftovers for two.  It was a bit below our expectations though, as we'd been expecting every dish to be stellar, compared to the hits and misses we received (especially that quail).

The sweet crunch of the bun and the sweet bbq pork went together so well. So original. \n\nSourdough scallion pancakes: so good, came with sauce, scallions, and fried onions.\n\nDungenous crab cheong fun: definitely not what we were expecting. Rice rolls topped with dungenous crab over sweet soy sauce. It was different but so good. I was not surprised that I like the crab because I like crab everything, but I didnt think I would like the combination.

He ended up making me a Bobby Burns. I've only had this cocktail one other time recently and the rendition here was more my style. Not as light and sweet.\n\n*Munchies: pickles, jerky, nuts ($8)\n*Wontons: Monterey bay squid, pork, garlic, chives ($8)\n*BBQ Pork Buns: char siu, pork floss ($8)\n\nSince this was our third stop, we decided to order some small plates. The wontons were my favorite out of the dishes we ordered. I don't normally like squid ink, but it gave the dish an earthiness that I didn't mind. The chat siu baos kind of reminded me of pineapple buns and had a hint of sweetness I didn't prefer. (I'm not a big fan of sweet and savory together.) The bun itself is really thin and flaky, so you may be disappointed if you like thick breaded baos. But I liked it since I don't like a lot of bread.\n\nThe Munchies were really just small little snacks. We actually got four items since they also gave us some kind of chip snack which wasn't listed on the menu. The snacks were okay, but it was weird seeing items that are normally paired with some kind of protein served as snacks. I felt like the meat was missing. When eating the nuts, I thought, where are the prawns to make the walnut prawn dish? And with the chips. Where was the chicken for the chips to sit on top of? And the pickled veggies reminded me of the free appetizer plate that sits on top of the lazy susan at family dinners. Other than the jerky, which was a tiny portion, most of the munchies felt like leftover items from other dishes.\n\nThe bar atmosphere of Mister Jiu's is dark. Kind of like a secret, down low bar. I only wish they closed the front door, as it ruined the ambience a little for me. And it made the bar cold with the wind blowing in. I was a little uncomfortable and cold sitting there.

Now, honestly... I'm usually very skeptical of paying big bucks for *fancy* Vietnamese or Chinese food, but the flavors and quality of dishes at Mister Jiu's was great.\n\nI arrived a little earlier before my friend and the staff politely let me know that they would seat me when the party was complete--which was fine! Upon entering the dining area, we were exposed to all the great smells and sounds of the open kitchen. Some cute chefs too ;).\n\nFor starters we each ordered a cocktail, I got Happiness and I believe my friend got Wisdom. Boy one was enough to get me feeling it! The flavors were subtle and sweet--so good!\n\nThey didn't have the Cheong Fun with Sea Urchin so I was heartbroken :(. \n\n1. Prawn Toast - We started off with the Prawn Toast. This was AMAZING to start with. The texture was amazing and the prawn inside just takes you by surprise. The sesame on the outside was awesome and then your tongue is left with a subtle saltiness that wasn't overbearing. \n\n2. Pickles - included a large variety and even though I'm not a fan of pickles, we cleaned this dish right up!\n\n3. Chilled Beef Tendon - was another thing that I would NEVER order, but the chilled beef tendon sounded pretty gnarly so we gave it a go. They said something about it being braised for 48 hours and you could really taste the deep flavors. It was such a cool take on tendon and I ate all of it! I don't even like tendon!!!!!!!! Picture has been uploaded. \n\n4. Dry Aged Beef Tartare - was OK. Now I love tartare, but had a feel this wasn't a place to get it at. Also, there were no pictures of the tartare so check my photos for that. This dish was decent, but forgetful compared to the rest. The flavors were not as strong or complimentary, but the beef was of great quality.\n\n5. Dutch Crunch BBQ Pork Buns - gifted from the Chef and we loved these. They tasted like chocolate chip eggo waffles with bbq pork inside! Sweet but definitely salty and savory. Awesome combo!!!! Great crunch/crisp to them too.\n\n6. Mapo tofu - this was FLIPPEN RIDIC. Such great flavors with a good kick to it. Lots of chili oil so stay away if you can't hang. Now, I usually complain about salty foods, but I was NOT complaining about this one! Get it with a side of rice cause dis stuff is SAUCEY. \n\n7. Smoked Hodo Tofu - this, unfortunately, was the loser of the night for us. It was the one dish that my buddy and I honestly just could not eat. We picked at the the tofu and eggplant, both of which we were not into. This ended up being packed up and taken home for my roomies. In comparison to everything else, this one just had to lose. They couldn't ALL be winners! (???right?????)\n\n8. Steak Fried Rice - this dish was yummy and a good rice dish if you don't want to stick to plain white rice. However, I wouldn't order this again. It was delicious--don't get me wrong, I just feel like I would be happier getting something else off that menu. Maybe I will try the noodles next time!\n\n9. Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck - AMAZING! FREAKING AMAZING DUCK. Best duck I've ever had. However, I was PISSED that it came out last because I was so darn full by then!!! LOL. Mind you everything listed here was shared between two people!! This definitely was the most delicious duck I've ever had since I've gotten back from Paris. The next time I come back, I'm going to request I get the duck first!!!\n\n10. Black Sesame Cake - Too much ginger :(. Not sweet subtle ginger either but a PUNCH YOU IN DA FACE ginger. \n\nOverall a great experience and I would love to come back and have my duck first!

I was driving in from work and had trouble finding parking so was 10 minutes late.  When I walked into the restaurant, I remarked to the hostess that I wish they had valet parking and she curtly with an accusatory tone told me \"that's why people take Uber here.\" Seriously!  She is criticizing me at the entrance of the restaurant, the paying customer?! Such rude customer service! Why not empathize and say something pleasant instead.  Don't you think I know Uber would have been better!  \n\nThe food was ok.  Quality ingredients but no unique items on the menu and no unique flavors.  We had steak fried rice which was very salty but just like another other fried rice.  Brussel sprouts with peanuts which also was very salty.  The orange chicken wings were crispy but flavor was not good, actually strange tasting (and not a sophisticated strange).  Orange chicken at any other normal Chinese restaurant in chinatown would have been better.  The dutch crunch BBQ pork buns were the most unique thing but the filling was very dry and again the BBQ meat would have been moister and more flavorful at any other Chinatown restaurant.  Chilled beef tendon had no flavor. Char Sui BBQ was roasted very well and tasted good. But it had too much fat and again didn't stand out compared to any other restaurant. \n\nOverall, food taste was 4/10. Wait staff service 8/10. Hostess service 0/10.  This restaurant is NOT, I repeat adamantly NOT worth the extreme prices.  There is absolutely NO \"wow\" factor in this restaurant!\n\nIf you want a tasty, worthy Michelin star experience, I would recommend Plumed Horse in Saratoga.

Just FYI the first time I went, they had a different menu - you pay 50-69/person depending on how many dishes you want. I think we paid 60 for 6 dishes shared with my bf. You were able to choose between appetizers, meats, rice/noodles, desserts, basically any 6 dishes you wanted. However, they have recently transitioned to the standard pay-per-entree style you participate in for most restaurants.\n\nOverall, I really love this restaurant. If you come here expecting traditional Chinese food, you will be disappointed. If you come here wanting modern Chinese food, or Chinese fusion, you will be in heaven. Ambiance is very unique - the restaurant is in Chinatown, but they completely renovated the space of the restaurant, creating a modern and fresh take, yet also preserving some parts of the neighborhood or Chinese culture. For instance, for the larger group tables, they have the round-family tables with a lazy Susan but it's fancy and embedded into the table. The lighting is also dimly lit, and the lighting focuses on the outside street where businesses are blaring their bright lights.\n\nService was excellent. The first time we came, it felt like they were rushing our meal. However, the 2nd time we came here, it was paced perfectly. I will give them some slack since they were pretty new when we first dined here.\n\nFood - highlights below. The menu items also changed slightly from my 1st & 2nd time.\n-Cheong Fun w/ Caviar - WONDERFUL. The noodle was made perfect IMO. Usually cheong fun's can be overcooked and too soft. However, the one here was not overdone and thus slightly chewy in a good way. Loved the sauce it came with. Also loved the caviar....yum.\n-Dutch crunch BBQ pork buns - very good.

Fun twist on dim sum. \n-Moo Shu Mushrooms - mushrooms that are crunchy, slimy, and flavorful with the jicama. You put them in the wrap, kind of like a taco. So good!\n-Tea Smoked Liberty Farm Duck. The duck was FANTASTIC. However, they took the Beijing duck interpretation, where you eat it with the wrap, hoisin sauce, onions, etc. When you mix the duck with all of these things, the excellent quality of the duck gets lost, unfortunately.

For dessert, don't get the soy custard, i'm sure some of their other desserts would be better than this one that's quite bland.\n\nI'll definitely be back!

Yes, I realize \"best\" is super subjective, and you're probably questioning why I used the word \"traditional\" since clearly this is a high-end trendy restaurant...\n\nFirst off, \"best\" in this case means most carefully prepared, most complex, most imaginative and clever use of ingredients and techniques, yet managing to stay true to traditional flavors and ideas--think your favorite Chinese foods, or perhaps those extra special Chinese things you'd rarely find this side of the ocean, but all made more special, more complex, more delicate, and more beautiful than you'd find at a typical high-end Chinese seafood restaurant.  And of course excellence doesn't end with the food--as you'd expect from a Michelin star restaurant the service ie exemplary, and your surroundings would also be just as enticing.\n\nAnd so about \"traditional\"... sure, it's a trendy, modern restaurant, but that doesn't mean that they're making everything all \"fusion\" as you'd normally expect.  Exact opposite actually.  Every single dish we had was very clearly rooted in Chinese origins.  Typical \"fusion\" silliness like tacos and burgers, with ethnic ingredients substituted, you'd not find here--there's none of those \"cheap\" tricks.  Just traditional Chinese food, but made fit for Kings and Queens (and with somewhat affordable prices!)\n\nWe have another reservation coming soon, so I just want to present some of my old notes for now...\n\nThis menu was Year of the Dog themed:\n\n1. Happiness $13 \"gin, sour apple, gentian, jasmine tea, honey\":  The tea taste was very strong and took center stage, with alcohol supporting in complexity.  Subtle fruitiness.  Could be more balanced though.  7.5/10\n\n2. Year of Dog $13 \"rum, sesame, orange curacao, orgeat, pineapple, lime\":  It was kinda like a spiked lemonade with Chinese spices.  Maybe closer to a margarita.  7/10\n\n3. Liberty Farm Roast Duck (Half) $65 \"pancakes, peanut butter hoisin, cucumbers\":  It was the most extraordinary roast duck I've ever had; not the \"best tasting\" by my taste, but it was definitely the most carefully made and most complex.\n\nThe skin itself was drier than normal, and doesn't have that crisp savoriness.  I think maybe the duck was too lean, but my gf liked it.  Otherwise, aside from that, everything else was AMAZING.\n\nMy gf, who was from China, says the wrap was from a particular region as it differs from the typical steamed pancake.  The sauce was a ultra-reduced stock, to a silky consistency.  I also loved the ultra thin slivers of onion, and the pickles were great (my chef gf also noted the use of an ice bath was perfect.)  The pate was beautiful--the flavor was familiar but I could not place it.  Even the hoisin sauce was special--lighter yet with a fruitier plum taste.\n\nThe effort of it all was extraordinary (though perhaps not to my taste.)  9/10\n\n4. Potstickers $16 \"pork, fava leaves, black vinegar\": Unfortunately ours was inconsistent as one had thicker and hard skin, while another was more supple.  But neither had that great chewy and elastic skin.  The meat was a bit dry.  At least the flavor was good.  5/10\n\n5. Carrot 'Ma Jiang Mian' $17 \"mustard greens, chanterelle, sesame, bergamot\":  Interesting spin on noodles, which were thick and cooked to a perfect al dente.  I would say they could be chewier, more \"q q\" though.  There were lots of flavors though to keep it interesting.  8/10\n\n6. Chilled Beef Tendon $13 \"celery leaf, chili pepper crisp\"\n\n7. Hodo Tofu Skin $18 \"yellowfoot mushrooms, chives, cured egg yolk\":  Hands-down the craziest tofu skin I've ever had, out of thousands over my lifetime.  The bottom was silky, which the top was crunchy, and it was all so beautiful and loaded with flavor.  If I were picky though, I'd say it needs some more salt.  Definitely handmade, hence the extreme price.  9/10\n\n8. Steak Fried Rice $24 \"wagyu sirloin, crispy garlic, broccoli, tuna heart\":  The steak was ridiculously tender and juicy, and the fried rice was perfect.  Crap tons of flavors.  You want this.  9/10\n\n9. Eternity $13 \"vodka, gin, lillet, dill, crab oil\":  Gawd... amazing.  Even the frickin' olive was insane--hyper smoked, with like a beef jerky taste.  Tasted smoky as hell.  The liquid was ultra smooth, and that little drop of oil added so much savoriness.  So light.  So effervescent.  10/10\n\n8. Jian Dui $6 \"fried sesame balls, guava jam\": Kinda disappointing given how special the other dishes were.  This one tasted quite standard, except for that fruity middle.  The dough could be softer too.  4/10\n\n9. Bruleed Dan Tat $3 \"egg custard tart\": Okay, guessing dessert ain't their thing.  The crust was overly bready, and not like flaky and buttery.  It felt like mushy pie dough.  The custard itself was okay, a bit sweeter than normal.  3/10\n\nMmmmm.......... more to come... stay tuned for round 2!!!\n\n5/5\n\n#contemporarychinese #traditionalchinese #fancychinese #sanfrancisco #michelinstar", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Bun\nChilled Beef Tendon\nChoy Sum\nHodo Tofu Skin\nWontons\nQuail\n\n"], "author": "Darin E.", "review": "What a time to be alive.

I was driving in from work and had trouble finding parking so was 10 minutes late.  When I walked into the restaurant, I remarked to the hostess that I wish they had valet parking and she curtly with an accusatory tone told me \"that's why people take Uber here.\" Seriously!  She is criticizing me at the entrance of the restaurant, the paying customer?! Such rude customer service! Why not empathize and say something pleasant instead.  Don't you think I know Uber would have been better!  \n\nThe food was ok.  Quality ingredients but no unique items on the menu and no unique flavors.  We had steak fried rice which was very salty but just like another other fried rice.  Brussel sprouts with peanuts which also was very salty.  The orange chicken wings were crispy but flavor was not good, actually strange tasting (and not a sophisticated strange).  Orange chicken at any other normal Chinese restaurant in chinatown would have been better.  The dutch crunch BBQ pork buns were the most unique thing but the filling was very dry and again the BBQ meat would have been moister and more flavorful at any other Chinatown restaurant.  Chilled beef tendon had no flavor. Char Sui BBQ was roasted very well and tasted good.

(https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg), two of my go-to sources, I was in no hurry to dine here.  I later learned that a friend had ties here and he invited me to try this place, but never found the time.  My cousin called me about a birthday dinner she was throwing for her dad, my uncle, which happened to be here.  On a cool San Francisco Saturday evening, we met here at 6 pm for our reservation.\n  My memories of Four Seas span from an upscale carpeted restaurant with a bar (only others were Imperial Palace, original one on Grant with a doorman, and the Empress of China) in the '70's to a decaying large party venue for family celebrations (Red egg and ginger parties or wedding banquets).  The chef Brandon, for whom this restaurant is named (Jew in Cantonese spelling), obviously had a vision when he partnered with the property owner in creating this new dining destination.  After leaving Bar Agricole, he toiled through the city's process in molding his creation here.  \nWith this knowledge, I tempered my expectations.\nHere's what my cousin ordered, all courses shared:\n\n1) Steamed Santa Barbara prawns, off menu, supplement (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MmEw0FpeZ4jrQBjnUPUrFg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Fresh and sweet tasting, but wished the dipping sauce was more bold.\n\n2) Devil's Gulch pig head (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sz8oxsO-X9ZDXQKlt3vb_w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - At first glance, one would wonder, 'what is that?!'  Once you start eating, your chopsticks keep reaching for more.\n\n3) Maine lobster custard (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=psQzHd0cixHBurkCVOM3xg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Think of a Japan chwan mushi jazzed up.

This is pretty darn close to perfection.\n\n5) Roasted Wolfe Ranch quail (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mummduSEOwVBFbzMBGPHpg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably my least favorite dish as it just didn't wow me.\n\n6) Braised Holstein beef claypot (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VkCSd2YS1hmel6HaGG4xcA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - No need to look further for my favorite, especially with my appetite for quality beef.

Tugged in an iconic alley, the restaurant provided a sharp contrast to the eateries around it. It was chic and fancy (at least for Chinatown standard). As expected, it had a price to match. For a $70 four-course family-style dinner (before tax and tips per person), you got pretty mediocre Chinese food with some Western modifications. The meal started with three plates of amuse-bouche (basically fried crackers). Then we proceeded to have the Dungeness Crab Custard, Uni Cheong Fun, Smoked Hodo Tofu, Heart Arrow Ranch BBQ Pork ($35 supplement) and desserts. They were not bad, just overpriced considering that you could walk within a block and got pretty decent food for 1/3 of the price. It's so tough to hate this place because I love up-scale Chinese.

They were perhaps a tad greasy for the first thing to go in one's stomach all night but they were worth ordering. \n\nWe then had soups -- I had a custom prepared vegetarian soup (without the chicken consomm\u00e9) and yet it was also good.\n\nThe cold noodles (sans crab) were absolutely delightful. The peanut/sesame sauce was rich, fatty and flavorful.\n\nThe smoked hodo tofu was revelatory -- one of the better tofu dishes I have had in recent memory. Exceptional dish -- nicely spicy and the garlic chives also worked well.\n\nThe silken tofu main was totally different from the hodo tofu but still fantastic. It was the only thing I felt didn't necessarily fit cohesively with the rest of the meal. The notes were less bright, and the tofu felt delicate, and almost ashen in a way, whereas the rest of the meal was much more explosive flavorfully. It was a good dish (on its own) but with the other four items I had, I'm not sure it was the right fit.\n\nAlso - the wines are fantastic and more than fairly priced: I highly recommend the California wines (the Ghostwriter, the Renaissance (both the red with dinner, and the dessert wine, were fantastic) here, as they're good values and also pair exceptionally with the food.\n\nOverall, great space and atmosphere as well -- super friendly and accommodating service. All in all, a great space for quality Chinese food.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-04-30"}, {"excerpts": ["Smoked Hodo Tofu\n", "This is the one dish I do NOT recommend.

If you love authentic Asian food like me, you're probably the same way and this mindset prevents you from visiting Mister Jiu's. I'm writing this review in the hopes of convincing as many people to try out the restaurant, especially those Asian-food-purists out there.\n\nMost dishes were absolutely delicious - listed in order of deliciousness.\n\n1) Cheong Fun\nPerhaps their most iconic and delicious dish on the menu. The Chinese flavors are juxtaposed perfectly with Western influences - the caviar and salmon roe adding a whole new experience to your typical rice noodle roll. This is a must try.\n\n2) Salt & Pepper Soft Shell Crab \nThe simultaneously softest and crispiest soft shell crab I've ever had. Just an explosion of flavors. \n\n3) Roasted Quail\nCooked to perfection and extremely juicy.  An explosion of flavor follows each bite, and the savory stuffed rice perfectly balances out the sweetness of the quail. \n\n4) Chilled Beef Tendon\nA simple, well-cooked dish. More faithful to original Chinese style, which might be refreshing to some. Not one of their iconic dishes.\n\n5) Crispy Daikon Cake\nDelicious, but nothing novel. Doesn't taste or feel much different than the turnip cakes you'd find in a delicious hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.\n\n6) Hot and Sour Soup\nInteresting take on a classic. Does not really taste like hot and sour soup, with a heavier emphasis on cilantro + soy sauce flavors compared to the traditional flavors. Fun if you're trying something new, but not life-changing.\n\n7) Smoked Hodo Tofu\nThis is the one dish I do NOT recommend. I don't think I quite understood concept behind this dish. I could tell the ingredients were fresh and well-cooked, but the sauce added little to no flavor. Very underwhelming dish.\n\nOverall great experience, wonderful service and food. Would recommend 100%, especially those looking for a new culinary experience.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-07"}], "sizzled king salmon collar": []}
