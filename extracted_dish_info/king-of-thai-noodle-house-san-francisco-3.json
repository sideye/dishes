In fact, when a group of us get together ever so rarely the answer to the question, \"what should we eat?\" will always be \"not Thai.\" But alas, you've finally got me to take the bait King of Thai. A co-worker had a horrible hankering for it and since I was the reason for his missed breakfast, I offered to grab whatever his heart desired. His heart desired Thai food of all things because apparently he was a mind reader and could see my brain waves read, \"anything but Thai, anything but Thai, anything but Thai...\"\n\nAh well, it was my fault and I'm the kind of girl to go back on her word so I ran to KOT with absolutely no expectations of anything remotely decent. Other Thai restaurants in the city had ruined Thai for me for months so it wasn't really their fault. I understood they had a large clientele base and there was always a line out the door and around the corner for some reason so I'll admit I was a teeny tiny bit biased.\n\nAfter studying the menu for a minute and narrowing down the soups, I decided on the wonton soup (to be on the safe side) and Pad Thai for the co-worker. Apparently, college age boys have a four compartmental stomach much like cows and each stomach must be filled with Kraft Jet Puff, granola bars, Gatorade, and Pad Thai or something in peanut form. Must be something about reverting to childhood favorites that keep them going. \n\nI walked inside and was semi-greeted by the girl at the take-out counter. I say semi-greeted because I wasn't sure if she was saying \"hi, how can I help you?\" or \"how many today?\" or \"welcome to Yu's dry cleaning\" because of her thick accent. I'm horrible with understanding anything that's not spoken in perfect English nowadays (which is ironic indeed) so conversing in any metropolitan city has become the obstacle for me as of late. Anyhow, I pushed on and ordered the entrees, paid, and stood there. And stood...and stood some more. The shame about this place is that they don't have a take-out waiting area to make way for more tables to sit down at. Imagine if it was raining??\n\nApparently, the take-out girl had the same problem understanding me and I had understanding her because lo and behold, only the soup came out. The only reason for me walking in a Thai place and there was no Pad Thai in my bag. That could have been my fault of course-maybe I didn't speak clearly enough? Maybe I should have counted my change to verify I was charged an amount that seemed reasonable for 2 entrees? In any case, she apologized politely, assured me it would be out quickly since it was only noodles and offered me a seat at the bar single seating area. \n\nAt this point, it was me who was starving. Against etiquette and better judgement, my stomach won out and I dug into the wontons. One by one, I plopped a delectable dumpling in the hot chicken broth, mixed in half a container's worth of hot sauce and found a much better way to pass the time. The broth was hot, full of herbs and tasted like a healthy alternative to chicken noodle soup and the dumplings were my very own two bite interludes.  A server randomly passed by and dropped off a glass of water as I waited which I thought was a lovely touch. And about a 1/4 of the way down the soup container, a pad thai was delivered and I was on my way again. \n\nI felt guilty it took over 30 minutes to just get noodles out of there but they did make up for it the second time with their quick service and graciousness. It's still not going to make me crave Thai food anytime soon but I won't be kicking and screaming next time someone suggests it.", "rating": 4, "date": "2009-07-28"}, {"excerpts": ["It is enough to share for 2-3 people and especially the Chicken Noodle Soup is the ideal hangover cure after some serious party action "], "author": "Kat G.", "review": "This King of Thai Noodle is the best in town: the portions are bigger and they have way more choice in their menu than e.g. the King of Thai Noodle at Grant Ave, SF.\nI love the place because the service is quick, the food is delicious and if you order their soups, you will be amazed by how LARGE the bowl is.

Located just doors away from Macy's Union Square this is a very popular restaurant with diners revolving through the doors at all hours.\n\nYou can pretty much expect the same quality food that you get at other King of Thai Noodle restaurants, but it is the slightly comical service that I received which I will remember most from my visit.  First of all the tables aren't wiped down very well at this restaurant, and don't bother asking one of the waitresses to wipe it for you because apparently they don't do tables here.  Mine had a sticky residue covering a good third of the tabletop.  \n\nOK.  Sit down.  Open the menu.  The first thing you notice is the spine is broken on the very worn menus, and the laminated but cracked pages are just waiting to fall out.  Study the menu well because the waitress won't be back to take your order for awhile.  During this time another waitress has brought me a cup of cold water, but she ignores my request to put in an order.  I've always liked King of Thai Noodle because I can choose the type of noodle (four types of noodle available) that goes into my noodle soup.  On this visit I ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup which is one of their more simpler selections.  So yet another waitress returns to take my order.  At any other King of Thai Noodle the food comes out of the kitchen exceptionally fast but not here.  My wait was close to fifteen minutes.  That gave me time to look around my surroundings and noticed the disgusting, dirty floor with used napkins, food particles and even chopsticks throughout.\n\nMy food arrived.  It's what I expected, a nice portion of noodles swimming in a big bowl with clear chicken broth and freshly chopped cilantro and green onion on top.  There are lots of thinly sliced chicken breast meat surrounding the noodles.  As I reach into the utensil holder to grab a pair of chopsticks and a soup spoon my waitress (same one that took the order) picks up a condiments tray with the five different spicy oils on it from an empty table and puts it on my table.  No sooner than I could pick up a piece of chicken from my soup did another waitress come by and pick up that tray of condiments and move it to yet another occupied table.  My waitress noticed this because she stopped and said something to the other waitress, but I didn't get the condiments tray back.  \n\nThe chicken meat was pretty much flavorless.  As much flavor as boiled white meat chicken can have I guess.  The noodles were firm and chewy and the soup was flavorful.  Several minutes later I had already consumed all of the chicken and most of the noodles when my waitress returned with another tray of condiments.
