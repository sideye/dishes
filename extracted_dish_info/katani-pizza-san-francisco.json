There are places that claim to have gluten free pizza, but that's all mute and void when the dough gets cross contaminated by being created on the same table with the same tools, etc.\n\nWhen I called in, the owner Katerina picked up.  I told her about my concerns.  She is very meticulous about her gluten free pizzas.  They are made in Vegas, then frozen and shrunk wrapped to her store.  She has no tolerance for employees who don't take the \"gluten free\" part seriously.  SHE HAND DELIVERED OUR GLUTEN FREE PIZZAS TO OUR DOOR just to make sure they were done properly.  \n\nI tried her chicken wings and they are equally delicious, breaded and baked with little bits of celery and carrot for taste.  I did not use the spicy sauce as I like it mild, but all of it tastes wonderful!!!\n\nDefinitely give Katani Pizza a try, they really care about their customers and do a great job delivering delicious pizzas: gluten free and with gluten depending on your tastes! :D", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-09-12"}, {"excerpts": ["*Chicken Wings: 6 pcs, spicy ($7)\n", "*", "The chicken wings were huge.

When the roommate asked me what I wanted for dinner, I figured we should keep the theme going. Decided to try Katani Pizza. We placed an order for delivery through Eat24 at 5:46pm. Our order arrived at 6:23pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Chicken Wings: 6 pcs, spicy ($7)\n*We Will Rock You Pizza: Tomato sauce, light cheese, Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami, ground beef, bacon, hot dog, Thin Crust ($24 for 14\" Medium)\n*San Francisco Pizza: Pesto sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, no almonds, Thin Crust ($15 for 9\" Personal)\n\nThe roommate loves meat pizzas, so I ordered that one for him. The pizzas are thin crust, so not super substantial if you're a big eater. It was fine with me as I prefer a thin crust, but I think the roommate would have a liked a thicker crust. The We Will Rock You pizza had plenty of meaty toppings. I wasn't sure how the hot dog would fit in, but it worked. I adore pesto, so I got San Francisco pizza. I wanted it to have more pesto flavor, but overall, it was a good pizza. The parmesan is strong, so don't order this if you want a mellow cheese. Also, I wanted more fresh arugula as I like that contrast in texture. The chicken wings were huge. Definitely a lot of meat on those bones. Taste wise, they had a little heat, but they were a little mushy on the outside.\n\nGood place if you like thin crust pizzas like me.", "rating": 4, "date": "2017-03-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The chicken wings were fatty.

It feels like a place where flatdwellers walk over to sit at one of the 15 chairs and have a semi-quick dinner (pizza isn't a quickly made dinner, no matter where you go).\n\nTheir pizza menu is quirky.  Each combination is named after a pop song, a song that usually has nothing to do with the ingredients used but who cares about that.  Like the old Ike's Place, but Katani has a manageable number of combinations, and it's easy to pick out what you'd like, unlike the huge and unorganized menu of Ike's deli.\n\nThe Hunny and I had what I called the Queen Special  Actually \"We Will Rock You\", and I was surprised that my girl didn't start stomping her feet twice and clapping her hands once.

The Hunny and I were impressed with the meat-lovers pizza we had.  I especially liked the tangy salami.  Katani uses a thin crust, halfway between regular pizza and pita bread.  I'd rather have toppings than bread, so this worked great for me.\n\nI love the owner, too.  She, like my girl's church friend, is from Bulgaria, so we got to talking (actually, she did most of the talking) about Bulgarian culture, Concord, her various businesses, the difference between the Orthodox Churches (\"they're all the same\"), marriage & family.  Friendly!\n\nThere are bigger pies available in North Beach if you want to gorge yourself.  They taste great too.  Katani can hold its own against them.
