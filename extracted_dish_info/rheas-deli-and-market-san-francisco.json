But I guess that's just SOP. I used to pass by here after work years ago and grab the Korean Steak Sandwich for lunch. It was $8 back then. I left the Bay Area for a few years and came back to discover that the Korean sandwich is $13. Bummer but I'll still pay that price. \n\nWhat Didn't: This unassuming liquor store still makes some of the best sandwiches around! I was initially a bit worried that my high rating was somehow due to nostalgia, however, my recent return to Rhea's reminded me of why they deserve five stars. The ACME sweet roll was perfect for this application. I feel that bread is too often under appreciated in a sandwich and merely thought of as a vehicle to hold the fillings together. But here, that sweet roll had a nice crust, chewy texture, a kinda open crumb so there were enough air pockets that the aioli/hot sauce can fill with flavor, and the bread alone had good flavor as well. You know when you have a subpar sandwich that uses inferior bread? You reach the last bite where it's just the bread left and you're kinda like \"no thanks I'm good.\" Yeah. That doesn't happen at Rhea's. The Korean steak was hot, not too salty, and had enough ginger and soy. Garlic aioli was creamy and actually had garlic flavor. Acidity from the pickled onions helped cut through the richness of everything. There was enough cheddar and it melted just enough to act as sandwich glue. The entire sandwich was juicy, yet, had great structural integrity and didn't fall apart in my hand. Nothing in this sandwich was an afterthought. Nothing! \n\nExtra Info: \n-Their hot sauce is not actually that spicy. And that's fine. I'd like to enjoy all the other flavors in my sandwich rather than feel too much of a kick in this situation. Order the spicy if you want to actually feel any heat. If not, go with mild or medium. Doesn't matter which. They are practically the same. \n-Barely any seating inside.

Unfortunately Rhea's does not have a website, which means no current menu, but luckily their Yelp page has their sandwich menu. After scanning the menu a few times, I debated between the Korean Steak or the 18th Street, which was personally recommended to me. \n\nWe were advised that Rhea's isn't a sit and eat kind of deli, so we called ahead for pickup. Once we arrived, both sandwiches were ready to go and although there was a small counter to eat, it's not the best place to enjoy your lunch hour.

The kimchi came in a small condiment sized container instead of on the actual sandwich. The verdict? Well, there was plenty of meat, a bit of shredded iceberg, some cheddar and indistinguishable sauce (suppose to be chili garlic sauce and garlic aioli). There were also some pickled stuff in there, but it was hard to make it out.\n\nMy overall impression was that it was good, but not $11.84 good. I mean, if someone threw it in my direction, I wouldn't run the other way, but what they charge, especially considering it's the Mission, is pretty ridiculous. I don't mind paying $20 for a fois gras sandwich from Naked Lunch, but I just don't see the value of this place. Maybe they used great meat for the sandwich, but it certainly doesn't show.

I believe the meat is Boar's head which is always a good thing. Not excessively lined with fat yet not too lean where it's completely dry.

Their acme organic rolls is also very tasty.\n\nMarinated Veggie Steak - $7.45 - This was a true surprise. I'm usually not a big fan of meat substitutes but this is the real deal. The flavor and texture is almost like a Korean marinated meatball. I could eat this and not feel like a wimp! I can't remember the veggies, but I believe it has lettuce, tomatoes and pickles with possible a garlic aioli. \n\nKorean Steak Sandwich - $8.99 - One of the more popular sandwiches so I had to try it, plus who doesn't like ribeye slices in a sandwich? The meat has been marinated in a soy sauce garlic, ginger, honey and other spices. I didn't takes a lot of ginger which is a plus for me, and it did just have a hint of the honey. The veggies included is lettuce and a very nice pickled red onion with jalapenos and fresh red onions. The sammie is sauced up with their garlic aioli on the organic acme roll. I can see why this is popular, it's quite good especially if you like spicy steak sandwiches.\n\nI'll be back here at least a couple more times.

I was initially a bit worried that my high rating was somehow due to nostalgia, however, my recent return to Rhea's reminded me of why they deserve five stars. The ACME sweet roll was perfect for this application. I feel that bread is too often under appreciated in a sandwich and merely thought of as a vehicle to hold the fillings together. But here, that sweet roll had a nice crust, chewy texture, a kinda open crumb so there were enough air pockets that the aioli/hot sauce can fill with flavor, and the bread alone had good flavor as well. You know when you have a subpar sandwich that uses inferior bread? You reach the last bite where it's just the bread left and you're kinda like \"no thanks I'm good.\" Yeah. That doesn't happen at Rhea's. The Korean steak was hot, not too salty, and had enough ginger and soy. Garlic aioli was creamy and actually had garlic flavor.

The entire sandwich was juicy, yet, had great structural integrity and didn't fall apart in my hand. Nothing in this sandwich was an afterthought. Nothing! \n\nExtra Info: \n-Their hot sauce is not actually that spicy. And that's fine. I'd like to enjoy all the other flavors in my sandwich rather than feel too much of a kick in this situation.

But then, today, I phone in an order for the Valencia, their totally awesome turkey-based sandwich.  Do I have their menu memorized?  No, I do not.  Does the guy answering the phone ask me if I want it Hot or Cold?  No, he does not.  Do I know that I'm supposed to specify that I want it Hot?  No, I do not.  So, what do I get?  A cold sandwich when I could've had a hot one.  Is there a big difference between hot, delicious MELTY cheese on your sandwich, and warm, delicious TOASTY bread versus cold slabs of solid cheese on room temperature bread?  COME ON!!  You know there's a big difference.  One is good, one is frickin' GREAT.  \n\nSo, again, sure, I'll take responsibility for making assumptions, but i think, at 8, 9, and 10 bucks a sandwich it's NOT unreasonable to expect that the person taking my order might use the following phrases:  \"Would you like that HOT or COLD?\"  \"What kind of cheese would you like with that?\"  I don't think that's asking too much, do you?  \n\nLessons learned:  1. assume cheese on every sandwich and specify which kind you want, otherwise expect boring American, even on a sandwich that doesn't need cheese at all (the Korean)  2. If you want it Hot, you better ask for it Hot, because the people answering the phone are apparently too busy to take the time to ask you.\n\nCome on, Rhea's!

Thirty-five minutes later, yes *35* minutes later, I got my sandwich.  If it's going to take that long, you would think they'd give a heads up.  At least I'd have been able to bring my copy of War and Peace and finished it by the time I got my lukewarm sandwich.  Sammy was tasty, but  too sweet. \n\nAlso docked a star since I was sitting outside, they saw me waiting for over half an hour, they knew I was waiting since I asked about it 10 minutes before, and they didn't even call my name!  It was only when the guy behind me got called that I asked about my sandwich and then they say, \"Oh, you're sandwich is ready, it's up at the counter\"  WTF?!  Yeah, I'll probably stick to Ike's 'cause at least they have a SYSTEM.   \nSuggestions: put a sign up next to the cashier saying \"Order sandwiches here\" and make sure the cashier says how long the wait is.  If the cashier has to stock inventory in the cold cases, don't let him do it when there are customers in the store since people were waiting around wondering why they have to wait 5 minutes to buy a pack of cigarettes when there were so many people waiting and no one behind the register.  That way introverted sandwich guy can focus on making the sandwiches and put out more than 1 every 15 minutes.  And you may want more than 1 person making sandwiches during lunch hour.  I'm sure my sandwich would've tasted better if I didn't have the bitter taste of bad service in my mouth.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-02-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I had the korean steak sammy and it was about the best sandwich I have had in SF.

My GF took a bite n threw it away while I managed to take 2 bites.\n\nAlthough this review does not reflect any of their other sandwiches which I've never tried yet... The fact remains that if someone can serve up something like that to their patrons, it shows how much they really care about their craft. I personally would never serve up something I wouldn't approve of. I hope they didn't serve me that sandwich thinking it was Ok. \n\nHow I felt: cheated of 10 bucks so they can get rid of old food.\n\nIf you're headed there maybe skip the katsu sandwich... You can't go wrong if they're just slicing meat n vegetables n slapping it on some bread I guess. Shouldn't be too difficult to serve up a 3 star sandwich.\n\nIf you happen to get the katsu n find it to fail your taste buds... Don't throw it into the trash. Help make it a greener world and throw that cardboard into the blue bin... Recycle. \n\nGood luck!\n\nI'm new to yelp kind of but you can see many more of my posts of amazing grub on IG colin_r2d by adding me.

So I had my doubts about going to Rhea's for their Korean Steak Sandwich, especially in such an unassuming place as in the Mission. But, boy was I WRONG. Don't be fooled because the Korean Steak Sandwich will be the best ORGASMIC sandwiches experiences you will ever have! Way better than Ike's...\n\nOn Thursday, December 30th, I came to Rhea's at 12ish after having just finished with a Dr.'s appointment nearby. \n\nUpon walking in, I was a bit confused on the ordering process especially when the directions on how to order was blocked by another person. So, I stood there for a good several minutes until the person left and I finally noticed the directions.\n\n1) Get a sandwich order form at the sandwich counter.\n\n2) Choose from their signature sandwiches like the Korean Steak and Chicken Katsu Sandwich or make your own by choosing your own bread, meat, cheese, and condiments. \n\n3) Give your order form to the cashier and pay for your sandwich (CC's accepted) before your order is processed.\n\nFree delivery is offered in the Mission area ($10 minimum) with a $3 surcharge past 9th street and Market towards Duboce streets.\n\nThere's a small counter for four in the market and a small bench outside to munch your sandwich. \n\nBeing the recipient of the 2010 SF Bay Guardian Best of the Bay Award, there was no question that I was ordering the much hyped Korean Steak Sandwich - Medium Spicy ($8.45). It's NO wonder that it won an award because the sandwich was K I L L E R!\n\nGrilled and marinated bulgogi piled over 2 inches high, layered with crisp spicy kimchi, sweet red onions, spicy jalapenos, chili garlic sauce, garlic aioli, and cheddar cheese sandwiched between a toasted Acme roll. The first bite was like an orchestrated symphony of flavors and textures in my mouth. The crisp and chewy bread led to the savory, tender and sweet bulgogi with a hint of gingery and garlicy goodness. The kimchi and chili garlic sauce added a fiery kick that was cooled down by both the creamy and rich aioli and thick slices of sharp cheddar. \n\nThere was no shortage of bold spices and flavors and THIS is how Asian Fusion food should taste like. No words can really explain how mouth-watering the Korean Steak Sandwich was and it's just something that you will have to \"experience\" for yourself.\n\nDo note that the sandwich tends to get soggy from the juiciness of the bulgogi, so make sure to eat it ASAP! \n\nSince I used the holiday season as an excuse to derail off my diet, I don't know when I'll be able to return to Rhea's. But I know when I do,  I will be throwing my carb inhibitions out the door and get the Chicken Katsu Sandwich too. :X\n\nP.S. - Rhea's sells the hard to find and highly addictive Cadbury Flake and Aero. \n\nKiller sandwiches and delectable Cadbury chocolates?
