"], "author": "Donovan H.", "review": "When you have a tourist trap area like Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf in the most popular part of San Francisco, one might always assume that food & drink prices are absurdly inflated. Not to mention, some of these restaurants offer only mediocre quality food. Surprisingly, this isn't quite the case with \"Wipeout Bar & Grill\".\n\nAs far as getting to this restaurant (located in the heart of Pier 39), it is relatively easy to find as you will see giant wooden posts paired up with palm trees and surfboards, it almost looks like a place that should be in Malibu or Honolulu and not a cool climate like San Francisco. Forget about driving to this place; the parking garage is located a couple blocks away. My advice is to either walk, bike, take a cab, Muni bus, or trolley.\n\nThis is actually my second time dining here, however it is my first review on the place. I came here with my lady and our friend (who was celebrating her birthday over Labor Day weekend). We arrived around 5:30pm (on the afternoon of Sunday 9/4/16) and were told by the hostess it would be about a 35-minute wait. Unfortunately, this place does not provide the portable buzzers when your table is ready; nor do they text you. Not a big deal but staying near the restaurant hearing for someone to call your name can be challenging, especially since it is very loud inside.\n\nAnd speaking of the inside, you will find a fairly large and spacious dining area complete with a very surf-inspired theme to it. Some of the tables are even carved out as surfboards. And for the serious surf enthusiasts, there is also a chalkboard that lists the daily surf reports as well as shark attack reports. One thing I didn't really care for were the bathrooms. A restaurant this busy only had 3 toilets (with private doors) that are used by men & women while the sink is located outside. That's a bit odd if you ask me. The outside has plenty of seating to dine as well as fire pits for those cold, foggy San Francisco days.\n\nFortunately the wait time was only 20 minutes and we are all seated around 5:50pm. Our hostess (whom I forgot her name) was very friendly and had an awesome personality. We all ordered drinks, I was craving an iced cold beer so I went with a 20 oz. size of the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. To eat, I decided on their \"Teriyaki Pineapple Chicken Sandwich\" (for $12.95). This consisted of a grilled chicken breast, teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple and jack cheese served on a toasted bun. As my side of choice, I went the healthier route and went with a side salad w/vinaigrette dressing.\n\nAs busy as this place was, all three of us got our meals out in less than 15 minutes; I find that to be quite impressive. Now onto the food.. I actually enjoyed every bite of my pineapple chicken sandwich. It was flavored very well and was a very generous portion that filled me up very well. My lady ordered their \"Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl\" and she loved her meal as well. However, our friend (who wasn't that hungry) only went with the \"Coconut Fried Shrimp\" (which was priced at $10.95) and was not satisfied how small the amount of food was that she got. My entree (that was only a mere $2.00 more) had way more overall food. So it really depends on what you order that determines if you get your moneys worth or not.\n\nOverall, \"Wipeout Bar & Grill\" is a decent place that won't burn a hole in your pocket. They do serve breakfast, a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar & several beers on tap), and finally a decent dessert menu. And speaking of desserts, our friend (the birthday girl) had Happy Birthday sung to her and got complimentary chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. So all in all, its a solid 4-star dining experience, not the best place I've been to but far better than some of the other overpriced touristy restaurants in the area.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-07"}, {"excerpts": ["I started off with the coconut fried shrimp.

It was a bit on the sunny side (at least in the morning), so we wanted to do something. We decided to go to Pier 39! \n\nCouldn't really decide where we should eat. Picked a couple places & just went with the one with the shortest wait..considering that it was a Sunday, Easter, & a tourist spot all day every day. The winning restaurant = Wipeout Bar & Grill.\n\nWhile I thought I'd have a good day (I mean..it was Easter!), the moment I went to up to the hostesses, I was automatically in a bad mood. I originally went up to the hostesses to inquire about the wait time for 4 people. They kind of just stared at me for a while, which made me feel uncomfortable. One woman asked, \"Do you have a preference?\" First of all, preference for what?! When I didn't answer right away, she looked at me like I was stupid, which I did NOT appreciate!! I think that's what ticked me off. She still didn't clarify her question, but I had figured out what she was asking me. But already from that point, I just didn't want to deal with her anymore. I almost wanted to tell my brother to let's go somewhere else, but I knew everyone was hungry. \n\nThey told me about 20-30 minutes wait time, so my brother, his girlfriend, & their daughter wandered around the area a bit. I decided to stay behind just in case we were called. They called my name (which they got wrong btw. I'm pretty sure 'Jessica' is a pretty common name) & I told them that I had to get the rest of my party. They were very IMPATIENT & quick to grab someone else. Like seriously?! They kept pushing me to hurry up basically & that was NOT okay. \n\nAfter getting horrible hostess service, I was hoping that the rest of the experience would make up for it. Our waitress was really nice, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star. As for the food, that was alright. Here's what we ordered...\n\nTeriyaki Pineapple Chicken Sandwich ($12.50) - I'm cutting down on my red meat, so I decided to get chicken instead. It was okay. The bun was way too small for the chicken..or the chicken was too big for the sandwich. The teriyaki & pineapple was good, but definitely made the sandwich messy to eat. Towards the end, I ended up using my fork & knife to eat it. It was just okay though. It also came with crispy fries, which were good. I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe Hawaiian Burger ($11.95) - My brother got this. He was craving a burger, & was satisfied. Also came with crispy fries.\n\nFish & Chips ($13.95) - My brother's girlfriend got this. She liked it..oh, my niece did too. \n\nOverall, I'm not a fan of my experience at Wipeout Bar & Grill.

And speaking of desserts, our friend (the birthday girl) had Happy Birthday sung to her and got complimentary chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. So all in all, its a solid 4-star dining experience, not the best place I've been to but far better than some of the other overpriced touristy restaurants in the area.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-09-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Hubby had fish & chips & I had the teriyaki pineapple chicken sandwich.

It was a bit on the sunny side (at least in the morning), so we wanted to do something. We decided to go to Pier 39! \n\nCouldn't really decide where we should eat. Picked a couple places & just went with the one with the shortest wait..considering that it was a Sunday, Easter, & a tourist spot all day every day. The winning restaurant = Wipeout Bar & Grill.\n\nWhile I thought I'd have a good day (I mean..it was Easter!), the moment I went to up to the hostesses, I was automatically in a bad mood. I originally went up to the hostesses to inquire about the wait time for 4 people. They kind of just stared at me for a while, which made me feel uncomfortable. One woman asked, \"Do you have a preference?\" First of all, preference for what?! When I didn't answer right away, she looked at me like I was stupid, which I did NOT appreciate!! I think that's what ticked me off. She still didn't clarify her question, but I had figured out what she was asking me. But already from that point, I just didn't want to deal with her anymore. I almost wanted to tell my brother to let's go somewhere else, but I knew everyone was hungry. \n\nThey told me about 20-30 minutes wait time, so my brother, his girlfriend, & their daughter wandered around the area a bit. I decided to stay behind just in case we were called. They called my name (which they got wrong btw. I'm pretty sure 'Jessica' is a pretty common name) & I told them that I had to get the rest of my party. They were very IMPATIENT & quick to grab someone else. Like seriously?! They kept pushing me to hurry up basically & that was NOT okay. \n\nAfter getting horrible hostess service, I was hoping that the rest of the experience would make up for it. Our waitress was really nice, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star. As for the food, that was alright. Here's what we ordered...\n\nTeriyaki Pineapple Chicken Sandwich ($12.50) - I'm cutting down on my red meat, so I decided to get chicken instead. It was okay. The bun was way too small for the chicken..or the chicken was too big for the sandwich. The teriyaki & pineapple was good, but definitely made the sandwich messy to eat. Towards the end, I ended up using my fork & knife to eat it. It was just okay though. It also came with crispy fries, which were good. I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe Hawaiian Burger ($11.95) - My brother got this. He was craving a burger, & was satisfied. Also came with crispy fries.\n\nFish & Chips ($13.95) - My brother's girlfriend got this. She liked it..oh, my niece did too. \n\nOverall, I'm not a fan of my experience at Wipeout Bar & Grill. From the beginning, my experience started to go downhill.
