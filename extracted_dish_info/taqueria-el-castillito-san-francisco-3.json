There was no shortage of hobos inside unloading their belongings on the surrounding tables as they glared and gawked at us while we ate.\n\nMy quesadilla castillito (I still have a hard time pronouncing it) was humongous and decadent, filled will plenty of meat and extras but it was very leaky. It was sort of a half finger food and half scoop out the innards kind of wrap, still no short of delicious. The carnitas tasted different, more chunky than pulled consistency, with plenty of grease and solid cubes of fat to pick out, but good nonetheless.\n\nWhat's up with the chips? You only get like 4 served in a small paper trough. WTF.\n\nOverall, not bad.
