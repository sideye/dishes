Somewhat crunch on the outer skin and not too fatty.  The curry was not spicy and good. \n\nGreen Curry w/ Beef: Beef what somewhat tough but it's ok because the curry was very good.  Kinda spicy (just right for me) \n\nTom Kah Soup: Dirty shrimp with poop still all in there (not cleaned), but the soup was good.  You just have to pick out your own SHRIMP POO \n\nPad Thai: OK; mediocre\nPad See Ew: OK; mediocre, on the sweet side, not my go to dish here\n\nBrown Rice: Good but there are grainy parts so if you don't like that type of texture don't order this.  It's $2 each bowl to go with the a la crate dishes and curries.\n\nWAITRESS RECOMMENDATION: Salmon & Eggplant:  Salmon did not taste fresh.  No flavoring besides fishy fishy ocean yuck with some bone bits in it. Eggplant was good.  They don't compliment each other; living in their own world in that dish.  FAIL recommendation.\n\nTotal: 3-4 star for food, but this is why they deserve 1 star\n\nNASTY WAITRESS!!  \n\nWe had an 8 mos old at our table, my infant baby niece.  All she does (like all babies) is eat, sleep, play, cry, scream, and baby talks with high and low vocals.  With this said she's also a girl so yes sometimes her pitch can be high.  I looked around & notice the guy behind our table laughing & giggling hard with us b/c he knows how random babies are.  (8yr old at his table) I'd laugh if I heard someone else's baby do that too.  \nThe next thing I notice was the same waitress (PAT or PACK) who gave me poor food recommendations glaring with burning angry eyes right at my niece (the baby).  I thought it was a fluke.  maybe she just have an RBF (resting bitch face) which is natural for some people LOL... since she had that pissed look from the beginning, I just thought it was normal for her & ignored it.  \n\nHowever, she suddenly became confrontational with us & told us in front of the entire restaurant to SHUSHHHH quiet & keep it down in a very disrespectful way.  It was not discrete or quiet, she looked like she want to strangle the infant!  WE WERE pretty quiet, besides baby random vocals of self blabbering & random screams..she's an 8 mos infant, just wow...!  Thought I was on the show WWYD (What Would You Do)! HAAAAaa & John Quinones was gonna come out & say we got yoU!!  WRONG!!\n\nwe are suppose to somehow silent the infant.  Or should we feel guilty for taking baby out for a family day for father's day???  \n\nDespite what we thought inside you know we told the waitress sure yes, we'll keep it down.  My sister in law (SIL) tried to hush the baby, gave her pacifier, swing her around, (can't eat while she's doing this obviously), all sorts of baby comforting things... I mean what else can we do besides leave??? I wish they would have told us from the gecko like hey this is not an infant baby friendly place, but no... just straight up embarrass & humiliate us after they rob our money.  In the middle of eating, shut up or gtfo kind of attitude... OokKayyyy there.... \n\nSo my SIL was going to write a review saying this place is not baby friendly to warn others, so asked another server for the RBF server's name (PAT/PACK) -I'll call her \"P\" for short. Suddenly P freaks out & does her weird DEATH STARE straight at my SIL with piercing eyes & said \"WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM\", so my SIL explained that it is practically impossible to control an infant baby's random sounds; how can we silence a baby?  P again freaks out & points at my SIL right in front of the whole restaurant & yells, \"YOU ARE THE MOM, you STOP your baby! OTHER MOMS STOP THEIR BABIES!\" Like OMG my jaw drops! How rude is that to say to your customer??  So we find out she's not a mom but she's judging someone else's parenting abilities & embarrasses us in front of the whole restaurant... I THOUGHT WWYD. JOhn Quinones can come out now because that is just something out of a TV!  Such NASTY NASTY attitude from P the waitress!  \n\nSo fellow foodies, please beware of this place.  They are NOT infant/kids/children friendly unless you have a mute.\n\nWith this poor dramatic experience, I really felt bad for my Dad who had to sit there & watch this like a show for Father's day.  I really regret taking him here.  I wish it was different.  I wish P would just learn how to be a proper respectful human being so that she don't ruin people's happy day with her negative vibe, poor energy, and doom and gloom demeanor.

We lucked out and found a spot.\n\nWe ordered duck fried rice, chicken wings, papaya salad, Tom yum noodle soup and Thai ice tea. Let's break it down:\n1. According to the bf, the chicken wings was delicious. It is saucier than normal places I've tried but the bf likes it like that. I do not. So it depends on people preferences.\n2. Papaya salad and Tom yum noodle soup was not sour or flavorable enough for my standard.\n3. Duck fried rice was mediocre. The duck was crispy at least.\n4. Thai ice tea was satisfactory. Bonus on the flower shaped straw.\n\nThe price was not too shabby so can't complain too much about the tasting of the food.

THE ONLY REASON I EVEN CONSIDERED THIS PLACE WAS BECAUSE IT HAD A 4 STAR RATING.  THANKS YELP!\n\nWe had two bowls of the the Tom Yum soup.  One with shrimp and one with chicken.  This is a very staple soup for a Thai place and should be an indicator of whether or not the food will be any good.  Well, this is when I first doubted the 4 star rating that this place has.\n\nThe soup was watery, bland, and overly sour.  I believe there were only a few pieces of chicken or shrimp in each bowl.  I was already put off that there were no family options for the soup, but the flavor and quality were sub par.\n\nMy Thai iced tea came after that.  This was more of a syrup than a drink.  It was extremely sweet, and when I asked if they could water it down with some tea, they only offered me hot tea.  This means that the Thai tea base was pre-mixed.  It just gets worse and worse doesn't it?\n\nNext up was the papaya salad.  This salad was just sad.  It came on a tiny plate, and if that wasn't enough, there was a bed of iceberg lettuce underneath it.  This was obviously a cost saving tactic.  The taste was also off as it wasn't spicy and definitely didn't have enough peanuts.\n\nThen came the pad see ew and the pineapple fried rice.  Both were embarrassingly small portions.  On top of that the pineapple fried rice was burnt.  BURNT!  There were specs of black in it.\n\nLast to come were the pumpkin curry and the green Thai curry.  Not much to say about either of these, except that I think they may have mixed up the sugar and the salt.  I know Thai curries are sweet, but these were practically deserts!  Also the pumpkin curry just tasted like a red curry with pumpkins in it.  If that were the case, it should of been listed as red curry, you can choose if you want pumpkin thrown in.\n\nI hope this makes you as disappointed as my stomach was last night.
