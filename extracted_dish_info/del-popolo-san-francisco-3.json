I can appreciate hunky beefcakes but am I the only that finds this hella awkward? Sometimes a girl just wants to get down and get her meat sweats on--those ladies were proper AF. You know if it was in the U.S., those dudes would have been torn to shreds on top of the bbq grill. Thirsty American females. Ok, maybe I should speak for myself. =X\n\nMy friend said that our cute waiter at Del Popolo looks like one of her associates. He ended up posing for the camera and unbutton his shirt a little, all in good fun of course. If you want to be entertained, our server was really fun and a sweetheart--too bad we didn't get his name. \n\nMy friends and I came to Del Popolo (owners formerly worked at Flour + Water) on their 6th night of the grand opening of their brick and mortar. They accept limited reservations for parties 4 or more. Unless you have reservations, I wouldn't come with a party more than 4 as the space isn't large. On Sunday night, we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. They will text you when your table is ready. There's no bar at Del Popolo but there's a bunch nearby (Hopwater is across the street and Stookey's is on the same block). Beware: street parking is a beeeyeeetch so better allot an extra 15-20 minutes for finding parking. \n\nDel Popolo has a small menu: 7 small plates ($10-$13), 7 Neapolitan-style pizzas ($12-$18), and 2 desserts ($8). Beer and wine only. \n\nWe started with Medjool Dates w/ housemade sausage, roasted tomato, bacon ($13): http://bit.ly/1jk4jnb. These savory sweet morsels with the fiery tomato sauce went great with our beer. However, the bits of bacon were really hard and difficult to chew. We also shared the Charred Cauliflower w/ roasted new onions, pickled lime, poached farm egg ($11): http://bit.ly/1Nto4qB. This would have been fantastic had the cauliflower been actually charred as the name indicated on the menu. My friend said, it tasted like citrusy coleslaw. He was right, it tasted raw.  \n\nWe shared 2 pizzas for 3 people are were full but not stuffed (each pizza has 4 slices). We ordered the Anchovy Pizza w/ crushed tomato, red onion, caper ($18): http://bit.ly/1Tfdy4U and the Bianca Pizza w/ mozzarella, ricotta, basil, garlic ($15 + $4 housemade sausage): http://bit.ly/1Ndj9rT. \n\nI've never tried pizza from Del Popolo's food truck but I have tried Flour + Water's pizzas and I wasn't a fan so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like Del Popolo's pizza. The pizzas were cooked in a wood-burning oven which produced a poufy, leopard spotted rim that was lightly crisp and fluffy. The bottom had a nice char with a soft, \"libretto\" center as they should for a true Neapolitan pizza. If you're a purist, then go for the anchovy pizza as there's no cheese and the tomato sauce had a good depth of tomatoe-y flavor. I love oooey goooey cheese so I favored the Bianca pizza which had both mozzarella and ricotta. Do add the housemade sausage for a meaty bite; I liked that it wasn't overly oily and overly salty. \n\nService was a bit on the slower side but since they're so new I'm sure things will ramp up once they've adjusted into their new digs. As I've said, our waiter was really fun and attentive when need be, and the other staff we encountered were cool. \n\nThe space is smallish medium size with a handful of two tops on each side of the restaurant, two small communal tables, and counter seats in front of the wood-burning pizza oven.

We went across the street and had a few beers while we waited.

We ordered the cauliflower au poivre with roasted winter greens, and the manila clams with braised fennel, caper butter & croutons. These two dishes blew me away! The cauliflower's creamy cheese sauce was extra decadent and the veggies were perfectly cooked. The mussel broth was so flavorful, I could have drank it straight from the bowl. Our server recommended we save some of the broth so that we could dip the pizza crust into it, which was a fantastic idea. The mussels were super fresh (not a single bad one!). Honestly, I would come back just to eat these two dishes. We also ordered the margherita di bufala and house made sausage pizzas. The dough/crust is fluffy and chewy (my favorite pizza texture) and isn't super floppy. The sausage pizza definitely had a good kick of flavor, but the margherita pizza was a bit flat. I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to blackened crust, and would have preferred the pizza to be less burnt. \n\nWe decided to treat ourselves and ordered the pot de creme and two glasses of port.

I came upon Del Popolo, which is on Bush Street, near Taylor Street, in San Francisco. What a find! \n\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our 6pm reservation, and we were graciously greeted by the friendly staff, who seated us promptly. The atmosphere is \"industrial chic\" with modern touches and an open kitchen, where diners could watch the experts flip and stretch the pizza dough, readying it for the wood-fried oven.\n\nWith six of us, we were able to try a couple of appetizers, three different pizzas, and three desserts. One member of our group wanted to have the roasted cauliflower as one of our starters, which sounded \"just OK\" on the menu, but turned out to be mouth-wateringly flavorful. There was a smoky flavor to the cauliflower itself, and the sauce was delicious. We also shared a couple of orders of the special appetizer of the evening, pork-and-veal meatballs (if I'm remembering the ingredients correctly) with a smoky, slightly spicy tomato sauce. The chef had elevated the flavor from ordinary meatball to a taste extravaganza, to the point that one of our group jokingly threatened to lick the bowl, just to get all the sauce (for the record, he used a tablespoon).\n\nWe had three pizzas: margherita di bufala (crushed tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala, and basil); butterball potato (thinly sliced potatoes, leeks, fontina cheese, and a dash of chili flakes); and house-made sausage (sausage, crushed tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, peppers, and onion). The chef had sliced the pizzas into six portions, so that each of us got to enjoy two slices of all three pizzas. First of all, the pizza crust, is soft and chewy, but still with just the right amount of crunch. All three pizzas were amazing, but I really enjoyed the potato one, personally.\n\nFor dessert, the server (who was professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, by the way) suggested the house-made panattone. Deducing that we all were thinking about those horribly dry, boxed panattone cakes sold in grocery stores, she said something to the extent of, \"Our panattone is nothing like the ones that have been on the store shelves for ages. It's moist and filled with fruit.\" She, the server, that is, had not led us wrong the whole evening, so we ordered a full panettone loaf for the table, as well as two portions of chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with sea salt and an order of butter-pecan ice cream. \n\nWe had started the evening with a Cabernet Franc (from the Sebastien David Winery), which was much lighter and more acidic than we had expected. A second server then came by to inquire on what flavor profiles we most liked in red wines, and he offered two suggestions, but freely quotes the prices ... and he was not pushing for the more expensive wine, which we appreciated. \n\nAll six of us were nothing short of delighted with the food, service, and atmosphere of Del Popolo.

The bottom had a nice char with a soft, \"libretto\" center as they should for a true Neapolitan pizza. If you're a purist, then go for the anchovy pizza as there's no cheese and the tomato sauce had a good depth of tomatoe-y flavor. I love oooey goooey cheese so I favored the Bianca pizza which had both mozzarella and ricotta. Do add the housemade sausage for a meaty bite; I liked that it wasn't overly oily and overly salty. \n\nService was a bit on the slower side but since they're so new I'm sure things will ramp up once they've adjusted into their new digs. As I've said, our waiter was really fun and attentive when need be, and the other staff we encountered were cool. \n\nThe space is smallish medium size with a handful of two tops on each side of the restaurant, two small communal tables, and counter seats in front of the wood-burning pizza oven. If you're on a date, I would definitely opt for those front row seats...in case your date ends up being a dud, at least you can gaze into the eyes of fully-clothed men making your pie.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-11-25"}, {"excerpts": ["We tried the margherita (classically simple and tasty), the butterball potato (surprisingly full of flavor), and the anchovy (loved the ricotta + anchovy flavors). \n\n"], "author": "Regina L.", "review": "Del Popolo is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.

We simply thought we'd have really good pizza but instead we had average pizza and crappy service.

Our server was nice until he messed up. He seemed to understand we wanted two sides and a pizza.
