I ordered this because my wife does not eat meat and since we had a third party with us I was finally able to indulge. To be honest I do not feel the need to order this again but the flavors were decent. Our favorite part was actually dipping the bread into the sauce and melted cheese.  It was however a decent size for sharing an appetizer. \n\nFlatbread $9.  I believe that the toppings on this change once in a while but the special this night was sausage and pepperoni.  The flatbread itself was a decent size and the flavor was not bad.  \n\nWe actually ordered an order of fries $3 and broccolini $7 but since the 4 orders above came out well before them we were already stuffed and luckily we had time to cancel the last two items.

I sipped on a Moscow mule that I wasn't in love with, so I didn't bother ordering another round.\n\nWe both started off with a cup of clam chowder and that was just okay.

We also ordered the Demoned Eggs served with aioli, shallots, celery and topped with fresh Dungeness crab and bacon bites.

I ordered the cornmeal fried chicken salad.  It was good, but it was way too much salad for just one person to eat.  I loved the taste of the chicken and like that it was lightly breaded.  I thought I ate enough of this salad, but still left a lot of goodness behind since I got full off our appetizers.

The cabbage and pickles added just the right amount of contrast by cutting into the richness of those three ingredients. For the side, you can pick home fries or hash browns. I picked hash browns which ended up being the most comforting choice as they reminded me of a certain fast food chain's hash browns, which I adore. My girlfriend got the burger which she enjoyed.\n\nOur server was nice and attentive. My gf and I were talking a lot, so it took us a while to look at the menu and order. She was very patient.

Major stars for the spinach artichoke dip, awesome and delish!! Cod tacos were OK, wouldn't order them again. Entrees we shared the chicken was was very solid and the pork spare ribs, also good. We didn't try any of the cocktails at this place as we settled for beer and wine but they looked really creative, solid. Prices were fairly reasonable. The service was average, waitress was very attentive but first round of drinks didn't come untll after our apps, despite being ordered a good 10 minutes before.....Overall a good place to go for some bar food, drinks, and mingling but if you want a knock-out meal probably not the place for you.

It's purely American, with cool rock and roll music memorabilia on their wall, plenty of TVs spread throughout to watch the World Cup and massive space for seating. \n\nI've been here couple of times now and while my favorite is still their ALL DAY happy hour Tuesday, their brunch is killer. They can accommodate large parties with only a week notice, don't charge cake fee, have fantastic service (hard for a large group!) and amazing food. \n\nJust how amazing?! Pillowy soft pretzel knots with jalape\u00f1o cheese dip, crispy flatbread with a over easy egg on top, delicious beef enchiladas, wonderful roasted chicken breast salad and even decent steak and eggs. The star of the show? The Impossible Burger! \n\nWhat is that exactly? Would you believe this hardcore meatatarian, is now a convert to a burger that is 100% vegan, and yet, it tasted just like the real thing! Upon further research, I've found that the Impossible Burger is made with potatoes, wheat, soy and a molecule called \"heme\" which even gives the meat that bloody color. It's something that's straight out of the chemistry lab and this delights the scientist in me! This burger is topped with lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and mayo. I took a bite out of my husband's beef burger and I swear, I couldn't taste the difference!  If you don't leave satisfied after eating the vegan version of a burger, then stuff yourself silly with their perfectly crispy thin cut fries. \n\nOrder an Arnold Palmer or a brunch cocktail and your Sunday is complete.

I ordered this because my wife does not eat meat and since we had a third party with us I was finally able to indulge. To be honest I do not feel the need to order this again but the flavors were decent. Our favorite part was actually dipping the bread into the sauce and melted cheese.  It was however a decent size for sharing an appetizer. \n\nFlatbread $9.  I believe that the toppings on this change once in a while but the special this night was sausage and pepperoni.  The flatbread itself was a decent size and the flavor was not bad.  \n\nWe actually ordered an order of fries $3 and broccolini $7 but since the 4 orders above came out well before them we were already stuffed and luckily we had time to cancel the last two items.
