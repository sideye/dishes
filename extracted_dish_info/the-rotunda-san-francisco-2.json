When a relative invited us to have lunch inside a restaurant inside Neiman Marcus, I was immediately intrigued. First off, I don't shop at Neiman Marcus. Second, I chuckled when I heard that the name of the place is \"Rotunda.\" Is this place popular with rotund people?\n\nNot unless they have a fat wallet. Of course, this place is super expensive. But not only expensive, but a bit on the \"stuffy\" side. I mean that in a nice way, of course. When you look up, the decor is absolutely stunning, as if it belongs in a museum. There's the urban view of Union Square and nearby high-rise buildings, with the sun shining through on a clear day.\n\nWe tried the following items on the menu:\n\n- Chicken consomm\u00e9 w/ mini puff pastry\n- Popovers with strawberry butter\n- Crispy lobster spring rolls\n- Ahi tuna poke\n- Char siu smoked sea bass\n- Crab and shrimp louie salad\n- Apple cranberry galette with cinnamon ice cream\n\nThe tiny cup of chicken consomm\u00e9 was a warm touch to start things off, a nice compliment to the oversized popovers. Apparently they are known for these popovers -- baked to dark golden brown on the outside, but light and airy on the inside. They are best when eaten piping hot and smeared with their delicious strawberry butter. You could slather that butter on an old leather shoe and it would taste good.\n\nEverything else was okay. Nothing we ate were absolute duds, but neither memorable. My personal dish was the char siu smoked sea bass, which was nicely cooked and tender to the bite. The char siu flavors came through, unfortunately a bit too strong that it seemed to overpower the delicate fish. The accompanying side of cabbage slaw or salad was a joke. Unless you're a rabbit, there's way too much bland cabbage for any one human being to eat.\n\nMy wife's crab and shrimp louie salad didn't seem too exciting. I did enjoy the warm apple cranbery galette, which was warm and inviting on the inside -- a nice compliment to the cold cinnamon ice cream. Service was excellent.

You can sit at a table, bar, or booth.\n\nWe were first served a Chicken Consomme upon seating. It's in a cute little cup with a little puff on the side. Though the look is fancy, it's really just chicken stock. I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and I liked it. Wasn't too sweet and can still taste the lemonade. Next, we were served a popover with strawberry butter. MMMM STRAWBERRY BUTTERRR Gimme more pls.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Lobster Egg Rolls. The egg rolls were fried to a golden color. It was crispy and yummy; make sure to dip the sauce! We also ordered the Lobster Bisque. It was really rich and creamy. Super filling, not ideal before a meal for small eaters like me haha. Another app we had was the Ahi Tuna Tartare. I never had raw fish until this dish. All fresh ingredients. Make sure you get some of the sauce at the bottom\n\nFor entree, I had the Grilled Pacific Coast Swordfish Sandwich. The sandwich is pretty small but the size of the fish was big. I was not able to put the whole thing in my mouth... I liked it but not as much as I liked the Lobster Club. My friends all ordered it so I wanted to order something else to try.  Also, the portion size for the Lobster Club is much bigger than the Swordfish.\n\nTo end lunch, we had 2 desserts. The Strawberry Napoleon Special was my favorite. The strawberry cream was tasty and the crisp on top made it like a nice sandwich. The bottom was some nutty spread that I can't remember too much of. We also had the dessert trio. The lemon fruit tart was definitely my least favorite because it was too lemony for me lol. The chocolate ice cream was ok... but the Thai Tea creme brulee was something different. It didn't have a heavy Thai tea flavor but the creme brulee was done nicely.\n\nAll in all, I had a positive experience.

The Rotunda has that elegant, pinkies-up ambiance that must draw regular customers from elite, electric-fenced enclaves like Pac Heights and Seacliff, but this strictly SoMa resident had never been before. I have to admit I had been curious to come here, and I found my prime opportunity when a former colleague of mine was willing to meet me here for lunch. Outside of the holidays, it was surprisingly easy to secure a reservation and make our way to the exclusive elevator.\n\nWhile we didn't score window seats since neither one of us was an Alioto, we still had a nice table overlooking the atrium under the magnificent stained glass dome (photo: http://bit.ly/1SVLKDD). The waiter had an air of boredom about him as he asked for our orders in the most impassive manner. In the meantime, we received our complementary popovers with strawberry butter (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYEM3Z). No complaints there as it was big, airy, and rather luxuriant for a starter to our meal. This was followed by a cup of consomm\u00e9 with a bite-size crostini (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ti5I8u), which we took our time sipping and nibbling, much to the chagrin of the waiter who rather boldly asked if he should take it away.\n\nUh no, we're just taking our time, sir. Regardless, we decided to start our lunch with the $14 Deviled Eggs, which were just four halves topped with smoked salmon, nori, paprika, and dill oil (photo: http://bit.ly/1NiPFew). Since we are both fans of this picnic staple, these were devoured quickly. My companion ordered the $22 Adobo Pulled Pork Cuban Sandwich, which struck me as an unusual menu option for such a hoity-toity place. It turned out to be a bit dried out even with ingredients like cured ham, Sonoma brinery pickles, Dijon, and gruyere cheese on a telera bun. It came with a generous side of sweet potato fries (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYEDNG).\n\nIt was just middling for the 1,180 calories it represented. Mine was marginally better, the $32 Lobster Club Sandwich with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, and lemon aioli on toasted brioche with a side of Yukon Gold potato chips (photo: http://bit.ly/1rgp3QU). For the 440 calories saved over the Cuban, it was worth the extra ten bucks even if the lobster was not the freshest I've ever tasted.

Our servers, Nicholas (and Pam when Nicholas went on break) were friendly and very personable. We started with complimentary popovers with strawberry butter- honestly, your visit to the rotunda isn't complete with having one (or two) of these bad boys. No celebration is complete without a little bubbly, so we went ahead and ordered the Gloria Ferrer Private Curvee Brut for $41/bottle and each of us had at least a glass or two as opposed to $10/glass. We also had another bottle of Prosecco but the name escapes me. \n\nThe birthday celebrant ordered the lobster club ($32) and it was one of the best lobsters sandwiches I've tasted in life.

It's delicious- definitely a must have.\n\nI went ahead and ordered the Pan roasted northern halibut ($30) - it had gnocchi, scallops, corn, peas, and saffron broth. It was more like a soup entree than anything, but regardless of this it was delicious! The scallops were small, but flavorful. The gnocchi was nice and chewy. And the halibut was flaky and had a good bite to them. \n\nOur dining companions ordered the steak and shrimp Vietnamese salad ($28) and this was very fresh! The papaya noodles were made perfectly and the shrimp were decent sized. They also had the estancia ranch grass fed NY strip steak, she said she enjoyed it but I wasn't able to sneak a taste. At this point I'm 1.5 popovers, an 8th of a club, 4 glasses of bubbly and my own entree in! \n\nI highly recommend the Rotunda at Neiman Marcus if you're feeling a little Pancy (yes fancy with a P).

Secondly, the restaurant is beautiful.  A glass ceiling and a breath-taking view from the fourth floor of Neiman Marcus -- the view alone definitely secures this restaurant a spot on my list of \"must go eat\" locations of San Francisco.\n\nI highly suggest planning ahead and making reservations.  My friend and I had a late lunch at 2pm and thought that we would have avoided the lunch crowd. Wow.  We were wrong.  This place is poppin'!  After lunch, people are there for high tea -- so at 2pm, the wait for walk-ins were at about 40 minutes to an hour.  Also, perhaps it was because we called ahead, but we scored seats right next to the windows and was able to enjoy the view.\n\nSo I admit, this place feels fancy -- almost borderline pretentious.  Do I drink my water with my pinky up?  Shall I speak in a British accent?  Does the bread go on my left or right?  Sure, I over-think these things, but all of those wandering thoughts were gone as soon as the waiter brought out their complementary chicken consomme and popover served with strawberry cream cheese.  What do they put in this food? Upon first bite, I'm impressed and addicted to their food quality and knew that the universe brought me here.\n\nI wish that I had a bigger appetite that day but I was still trying to recover from the food-ventures of that week.  My heart was saying \"order everything\" but in a battle of wills, my logic won out and I just ordered the Lobster Club ($28).  Now that I think about it, it's probably better that I wasn't too hungry or else I would have had to pull out a loan.  Twenty-eight dollars for a sandwich sounds crazy, I know, but after reading the description -- applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, lemon aioli on a toasted brioche, served with yukon gold potato chips -- how could I pass?  The club was fantastic.  The chips were fantastic.  Generous pieces of lobster were in every bite and the flavors were wonderful.  What more can a girl ask for?!\n\nThey say first impressions are important and The Rotunda left a great one.  From food, to service, to the beautiful atmosphere, I am definitely a fan.

It sounds like a lot but we halved everything.  Next time around, I think I will order the Lobster Bisque, Lobster crab and shrimp salad, and Peanut Butter and Jelly Mousse for dessert. That would be perfect. \n\nOur waitress was also amazing. We could tell that she deals with a lot of snobby people because she seemed a little surprised when we said please and thank you, and were very appreciative of her service. She was very attentive and always on point. She even took the initiative to split the items we ordered which showed us that she actually listened to us say that we wanted to split everything, in the very beginning.  \n\nI also would like to point out that the busboy in our area was also great. He was very attentive with keeping our water glasses filled and our table clean and clear - but not in an intrusive way.\n\nThe not so good: \n\nI would have LOVED to sit near the windows, but the hostess told us that the three (yes - 3) open tables in front of the windows were spoken for.... They didn't fill up until we were almost ready to go, which was really irritating - we could have sat there! That's why I only gave 4 stars.. Plus, our hostess was really rude and had such an attitude. Not a good look.\n\nThe restaurant itself could use a little updating. They have a bit of an 80's thing going on that could use a little refreshing. For example - the dark wall paper, the booths could be refreshed, the leather bar chairs at the bar scream 80's,  and the butterfly decor on the book shelves - some attractive glass sculptures would look really nice there instead.. These aesthetics are not a make or break, but still, just saying...\n\nOverall:\n\nI had a great time and enjoyed every single bite of everything we ordered. Loved our server and busboy. Also enjoyed the beautiful restaurant itself (even though it's still in the 80's). ;o) I highly recommend the restaurant!

Some of the clientele go a little overboard with the dressing up and pretentious snobbery, but that's just more entertainment for your buck. E.g. Play a drinking game for every time a twenty-something wobbles by in heels too high for her frame with a designer handbag dangling from the crook of her elbow. By the end of your meal, you'll either be wasted or broke (or both). \n\nI came here twice within one month, once for afternoon tea, the other time for lunch.\n\nAFTERNOON TEA\nMy friend and I got the standard Rotunda Tea for 2 and added a couple of cocktails to the experience because we're super classy booze hounds like that. The menu offered the usual 3 tiers of scones/cream/jam, tea sandwiches and desserts. The desserts were definitely the best.\n\nNuit a Versailles: The pot of tea we shared. A mildly flavored black tea with just a hint of smokiness\n\nSmoked Salmon Sandwich: Good but nothing remarkable\n\nChicken Salad Sandwich: Tasty and not too mayo-y\n\nDungeness Crab Profiterole: A delicious and rather unique addition to the average tea sandwich platter\n\nCucumber Sandwich: Good but forgettable\n\nGuava Cake: My favorite of the desserts. The mousse was sweet yet tangy with the perfect essence of guava (one of my favorite fruits), and the cake was so moist\n\nLemon Tart: Light, flaky crust and a great citric filling\n\nChocolate Over Lemon Cake: I don't think this was its actual name, but I can't remember. Anyway, this cake was also unbelievably moist without being too rich. Great chocolate + lemon combo\n\nHazelnut Cake: I adore anything hazelnut and was not disappointed by this\n\nFrosted White Raspberry Cosmo: My cocktail pick. Gorgeous to look at, delicious to sip. My friend ended up preferring mine to hers\n\nLemon Gum Drop de Lite: My friend's pick. It was decent but tasted more or less like a lemon drop, which you don't have to pay $12 to get\n\n\nLUNCH\nLobster Club: Applewood-smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, lemon aioli, toasted brioche and yukon gold potato chips. The most popular item on the lunch menu and with good cause. The portions are huge and the lobster is tender and fresh. The combination of the other ingredients enhance and complement but never overwhelm\n\nTuscan Chicken Melt: One half ciabatta, sliced grilled all natural chicken breast, fresh mozzarella, pesto, arugula, tomato, grilled peppers, salad and fruit. The pesto was delicious and the bread was nicely toasted. Portions were large and generous, as with the Lobster Club. However, for the price that they charge, I felt like there should have been more high-quality accompaniments--maybe a cabrese salad instead of the plain, mixed greens salad they provided?\n\nArtichoke Ravioli: Accompanied by dungeness crab, tarragon butter sauce and organic cherry tomatoes. This was absolutely delicious in every way. The ravioli were huge, soft and well-built, stuffed to the brim with an amazing artichoke pate-like filling. The sauce was light and tasty without being rich or oily, and the cherry tomato slivers provided the perfect tangy finish\n\nBased on my experiences, I would definitely recommend going to the Rotunda for lunch over afternoon tea. Both are pricey, but I think you get far more bang for your buck with lunch. Service is always friendly and attentive bordering on obsequious.

It was quite quiet when I was there. \n\nI love the ceiling of the dome that The Rotunda spans around, it's gorgeous. I always admire it when I walk into or by Neiman Marcus. There aren't many places I have seen that have a ceiling as pretty as this. \n\nSo on to the food, I ordered the Lobster Club sandwich for lunch and I really enjoyed it.

To me, it would be a great place to have a nice lunch during a day of shopping at Westfield or around Union Square. If I was still living in the Bay Area and it was a really special occasion, I would consider making a special trip here for lunch. To someone that has wanted to try it for a while or heard about the beautiful ceiling and wants to see it in person, these are both good reasons to go and check it out. It might also be a nice place to take a girl out**\n\nTl;dr: 4-Stars. The Lobster Club Sandwich was quite good, I would give it 3.5-Stars by itself. But that gorgeous ceiling and the clean, crisp atmosphere definitely adds to my opinions and that is why I give it 4-Stars overall. \n\n**I would say this is definitely a nice place to take a girl for a classy lunch if it is your style!

On a very busy day after Christmas while in Union Square, we decided to eat lunch at the Rotunda.  The Rotunda is located near the top floor of Neiman Marcus (second to the top-most floor, IIRC) and has a great panoramic view of the square.  Of course, this place was packed and our wait was about 1.5 hours since we didn't have a reservation.  This was fine with us as we spent all that time shopping and walking around Union Square and the surrounding area.\n\nThe Rotunda is really just a place to grab a fancy lunch (e.g. a sandwich can cost close to $30 here!).  The restaurant is not open for dinner.  The inside is bright, open, and naturally well-lit because of all the glass facing the outside.  Along with all the tables and cozy circular booths on the main floor, they also have a small stylish bar and private rooms.  The crowd can be mixed and diverse -- lots of tourists and also many female shoppers who like to show off their designer apparel, accessories, and shopping bags.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\nWarm seafood salad - seared dayboat scallops, prawns, herb butter glaze, radicchio, Belgian endive, tarragon vinaigrette\nLobster club - applewood smoked bacon, avocado, lemon aioli, toasted brioche\nGrilled rare ahi tuna Nicoise sandwich - mixed greens, Nicoise olive aioli, toasted rustic roll, herbes de provence seasoned fried potatoes\nSeared Bay of Fundy salmon - roasted sweet potato, balsamic brussels sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, leeks, radicchio, lemon\n\nThe meal started off with hot chicken broth, popovers, and strawberry butter.  According to the menu, this is apparently a \"Neiman Marcus tradition.\"  I have to say, the tradition tastes pretty good.  The broth was served in a small mug with a bite size biscuit.  Hot and savory.  The popovers are very popular.  It's basically bread that is hollow in the middle.  The outside was crispy and the inside was very soft.  The inside reminds me of the inside of a biscuit or croissant.  The strawberry butter goes with the popover and it was light and sweet.\n\nThe Seared Bay of Fundy salmon was fresh, tender, and seasoned well.  One of the best salmon fillets I've tried.  The fillet sat on top of slices of sweet potato and vegetables, including firm pieces of brussels sprouts.  The ahi tuna was also fresh and soft.  The lobster club was stuffed with *a lot* of lobster.  The fries here are pretty good - crispy and not too salty or greasy.  Overall, the food is good.  While this is a lunch place, portion sizes are quite large, so don't be surprised if you leave with plenty of leftovers.\n\nService was satisfactory.  We ordered our food before the table next to us, but they got their dishes well ahead of ours.  When our food finally arrived, they totally botched which one of us ordered what dish.  In the end, it didn't matter since we ended up sharing.\n\nIn summary, a pretty cool place to grab lunch if you're in Union Square.  If you come, definitely book reservations to avoid a wait.

I was particularly interested in afternoon tea and those famous popovers with strawberry butter everyone keeps raving about. We arrived a little before our 2:45 reservations and were seated within 5min and mentioned it was my b-day. I did feel the wait staff was a little rushed but still felt like others who got seated after us were at least getting their waters brought to them quicker than we were.\n\nFinally, we were brought some chicken consumee along with those popovers. Both were tasty but the popovers were definitely, my favorite! I decided to get afternoon tea for one, while the hubby got the lobster club for lunch. We both got a bowl of their lobster bisque, which was very delicious and not overly salty with some chunks of lobster. My afternoon tea was rather disappointed considering for $35 (which is already steep for finger sandwiches and a pastries) as it only had about 8 tiny HALF sandwiches so it was more like 4 and a few tiny desserts, which i really didn't care for. The tea pot included was very small and they used a tea bag rather than loose leaf tea so it wasn't as strong as you would expect. The black tea with berries was nice but i've honestly had much better tea and sandwiches at Lovejoys for far less. I will say their egg salad is delicious though. My husbands lobster club was far better tasting and more filling, so i would have to recommend coming here for their lunch options rather than the afternoon tea.\n\nOur bill after, came to almost $100 but i was very saddened and disappointed that at the very least neither the hostess or waiter ever acknowledged that it was my b-day, considering it was also my first time there.  Why bother having people list a special occasion when you aren't even making sure your servers are aware of it? \n\nAnyway, sad to say i am glad i didn't book my anniversary here and while the place is lovely for the atmosphere, it still leafs (pun intended) something to be desired in terms of their afternoon tea service!", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-01-05"}, {"excerpts": ["My mom ordered the afternoon tea and its assorted pastries, and I ordered the lobster club, the latter of which I would recommend to the moon and back.

My mom pouts and says \"You're so mean.\" I whimper back and say \"You promised!\" She giggles and says, \"Well too bad, I'm going.\"  I asked, \"Then why did you ask me if it's ok?\" She responds with, \"Because I didn't think you'd say no!! Ok I'm going now...\" She hangs up.\n\nAfter more failed attempts, a bunch of pouting, guilt trips, nagging, and temper trantrums of \"My mommy promised to take me!\" my mom FINALLY took me to eat at Rotunda for my birthday THIS year.\n\nEven on an overcast December afternoon, the view from the restaurant is spectacular. Seeing people hurrying along in Union Square carrying shopping bags puts me in a very happy holiday mood.\n\nYou start off with a complimentary shot of chicken consomme with a cute moon-shaped puff pastry. It was a little salty but that's the way I like it. After reading so many reviews on this so-called heavenly popover and strawberry butter I was expecting to eat the most delicious thing ever. Eh... I wasn't that impressed. It just tastes like Yorkshire pudding but in a big puff. If anything, I think mine was over cooked and a bit dry. I will admit the strawberry butter was tasty. I noramlly don't use that much butter but I was slapping it on like there was no tomorrow.\n\nThe lobster club looked so delicious but unfortunately both my mom and I are allergic. :( So I ordered the cheeseburger after hearing how good it was. The burger itself isn't much to write home about but the fries were to die for. Thinly cut, crisp to perfection, with just the right amount of salt. Throughout lunch I had to maneuver my way around the plate because my mom's hands kept wandering over to steal fries.\n\nMy mom ordered the sear scallops. Oooo...they were SO good! Tender, flavorful, and juicy....highly recommended.\n\nFor dessert we tried the plate of three pettifores. It was so cute! It came on a plate divided into 9 sections (think the Brady Bunch squares). One was a puff filled with green tea gelato. The dipping sauce for this puff was creamy. It tasted like tapioca pudding minus the tapioca. The second puff was lemon with a vanilla gelato filling. Its dipping sauce was a ground up mint and basil syrup. It sounds odd but it was really refreshing. The third puff was chocolate with strawberry gelato in the middle. The dipping sauce was an ooey-gooey chocolate fudge. To finish it off, they provides a cute baby strawberry, a dollop of fresh vanilla bean whipped cream, and an orchid.\n\nThe food quality was impeccable and the service was extraordinary. Our waiter didn't seem pretenious at all. He was always smiling, checking in on us, and our water and iced tea cups were never empty.\n\nMy mother who is a HUGE high tea fan asked to see their tea menu. We looked at it and it seems reasonable and sounded good that we both agreed we should try it one day. Well...the very next day after we ate my birthday lunch here she comes home and says to me. \"Guess what?\" I look at her and say \"What?\" She smiles and says \"Don't get mad at me now!! But guess where this girl from work took me today?\" I respond \"Where?\" She slyly whispers \"Rotunda for tea.\" OMG! So of course my mom says she \"promises\" to take me there just the two of us....yup, I've heard that one before.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-12-04"}, {"excerpts": ["Yesterday my wife had the lobster club and I had the burger.

The first time my friend and I got lucky and got the last first-come, first serve sofa seating rather than waiting 90 minutes for a table during the lunch rush. The second time, I came with a party of 3 and the wait time was 60 minutes. Since we were tight on time, we decided to head over to Cheese Cake Factory, as we were headed up the elevator, they texted me saying the table is ready. This was the only time I was presented with the mint chocolate square at the end of my meal. Overall, seating is a bit funky, that or I've been lucky this week. \n\nThe first time I came I had the Tuscan Chicken Melt (16) which came with petite cup of fruit and salad. At first glance I thought it looked a bit funky because the cheese appeared as a big blob of semi-melted on top of slices of chicken breast. Everything is cooked to perfection in the sandwich. No qualms there. However, the sandwich itself is small. It's literally like 4 inches long. A bit if a disappointment for the price you pay especially for a person who can eat about three of these and still not be full. \n\nThe Grilled Chicken Piccata Sandwich (18) was equally as good and equally small. \n\nThe popover was a bit too flanky for my liking since everything seemed to flake all over the table and into my lap To me it tasted like nothing. It did not have any particular taste. The strawberry butter is a nice touch. I can see myself gaining a lot of weight eating this combo, particularly the butter, often. \n\nThe complementary tea and mini puff thing was interesting. The first time I didn't like drinking the chicken broth from the miniature tea cup because it was so salty. The second time I think I acquired a quick tolerance for it. \n\nThe atmosphere can get a bit loud especially if you're sitting towards the front where people are waiting to be seated. Further back, it quiets down unless you have a noisy party next to you. The seating is arranged in a large circle with the natural light shining through. \n\nThe waitstaff is generally pretty nice. \n\nI'd come back, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

You actually select a lunch entree from the private menu list. Most of the ladies got the crab/shrimp louie and the chicken paillard milanese.  The portions are pretty large, which includes a mini soup broth, bread popper and a sorbet dessert. We also ordered champagne as a celebration.

It is recommended to have one person collect in advance before reserving and then have one person pay with a credit card at the end of lunch.\n\nThe location is great since it's downtown SF and easy for everyone to get to. It's also very pretty inside the interior design. You have to take an elevator from the street level up. I have been here for lunch a few times and ordered the lobster roll which was great also.

Set beneath a landmark stained-glass dome and overlooking the city, the Rotunda is a feast for the eyes. I was only disappointed that Union Square is under construction or else the scenery would have been perfect. Situated on the second highest floor in Neiman Marcus, this place serves high tea and lunch. I called in for a reservation for 1:30pm unaware that their tea is only served after 2:30pm. Thus, my friend and I were unable to order afternoon tea. Thus, we ordered alcohol instead :)\n\nTuscan Pesto Chicken Melt: The chicken was very tender and not dry at all (which is my biggest fear when it comes to ordering chicken). In addition, there was a light salad that accompanied the melt. Overall, it was tasty and flavorful, just a tad pricey ( 20 bucks for a sandwich...).\n\nRickey Rose: Much stronger than I thought. I knew they wold put gin in it but it was way too strong. You can ask them to dilute it if you are a weakling like me.\n\nMy friend ordered the Chicken Paillard Milanese. It was alright. Just what I expected. Just chicken. In addition she got a Bloody Mary.\n\nVERDICT: I must say, I was mostly in awe of the actual location. It was beautiful. In addition, service was awesome. They gave us these popovers that are so flaky, warm and tasty. Everything else was too expensive. Perhaps, come here once or twice to indulge. Keep in mind you will probably spend about 100 for two people.
