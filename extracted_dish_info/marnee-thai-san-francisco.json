The rolls are deep fried with ground chicken, prawns, cabbage, mushroom, and bean thread noodles. Tasted like egg rolls. Nice crunch on the outside. \n\nPad Thai ($11.95): I ordered pad thai with chicken (they also include pieces of tofu in the dish). The portion size was very generous. Noodles were cooked well but the dish was a little bland in my opinion. Might need to order it spicy next time for an extra kick.\n\nMussamun Chicken Curry ($13.95): Unfortunately this was my least favorite dish. The chicken was all dark meat (I didn't know that, and prefer white meat). And the curry was pretty runny, similar to a ramen broth. I am used to thai curries being thicker and rich but this was the opposite. The flavor was also a little bland in my opinion.\n\nOverall the prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food for what you pay for. Delivery of the food was fast.

And it was not a disappointment, but i was definitely not impressed also. \n\nWe came in early on Sunday for dinner, so we were seated right away. But right away, people started to wait outside in front of the restaurant. We had angel wings and satay chicken for appetizers. Angel wings were delicious, very flavorful and crispy on the outside. This is my favorite. Chicken satay was typical. What they had differently was the lettuce to wrap chicken with satay peanut sauce. At other restaurants, there are usually just the chicken skewers with sauce and pickles. \n\nWe ordered panang curry chicken, pad kee mao, mango fried rice, tofu eggplants for entrees. Panang Curry was different, and I didn't like it. It was served on a plate instead of a bowl. There were a lot of meat (chicken in this case) and very little of the curry part. I normally had Panang curry with majority of the curry, so I could pour curry over my rice (: But here at Marnee Thai, there was barely any curry for you. It was more like chicken saut\u00e9ed with curry sauce. Failed.  Pad Kee Mao was not as spicy as how Pad Kee Mao typically is, but I have no problem with it since I'm not a fan of super spicy. However, I would prefer the thicker & wider noodles. Mango fried rice- this is the first time I had mango fried rice. The fried rice is good but not OMG or WOW. The rice was not too dry or too mushy. It was perfectly cooked. The touch of mango gave the dish a special and unique flavor. Tofu eggplants - I thought this dish was only okay here. There were mostly eggplants and very few tiny pieces of tofu. The flavor is good. Another highlight of this restaurant is the dessert Roti Ice Cream. We've ordered Sticky Rice with Mango and Roti Ice Cream for desserts. The Mango Sticky Rice was very very good. But I almost always found this dessert at any Thai restaurant, and they always make it super good. For the Roti Ice Cream, this  is the first time I tried. It is actually a very clever combination. Fried crispy dough or \"roti\" sprinkled with some condensed milk and topped with vanilla ice cream. It is similar to fried ice cream. It is very different and very good. \n\nService was good.

We were meeting my sister and her family, but we got there early and held a table while we waited. We were lucky to get there when we did (at 6PM) because we only had to wait for about 3 minutes to be seated; shortly thereafter, there was a line out the door!\n\nWe sat down and ordered appetizers while we waited. We had the chicken satay wraps and the summer rolls. The summer rolls were delicious, but they had more rice noodle in them that I would have liked (usually I like more vegetable); however, they were fresh and tasty overall. The satay was great--it was unique in that they were wraps (served with big leaves of butter lettuce, bean sprouts and cold rice noodles), which made it fun!\n\nWhen my sister arrived, it turned out that she had brought more people than expected, so we had to change tables in this very crowded restaurant. The head waitress accommodated us, but not without letting us know what an inconvenience it was. She was a bit abrasive, but had complete control over the situation, which we appreciated.\n\nWhen the waitress took our order, it was a bit chaotic (to say the least). We had some questions, but she didn't give us time to ask them; instead, we were rushed through and some of us were even passed over as she skipped immediately to the table next to us. It was pretty odd, and left us dazed and confused.\n\nFor additional appetizers, our group shared the coconut hot cakes, which had been recommended to us by a friend of my sister's. They looked like deviled eggs and came hot off the griddle, topped with some corn kernels, ham, and some sauce. They were pretty tasty, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our entrees (and the line outside was growing longer), we saw May (Marnee) enter the restaurant and take complete control. She walked from table to table like she owned the place, and indeed! She does! Quite a presence.\n\nOur food arrived in a completely arbitrary order--obviously they just brought it out as it was ready. There was no room on the table for all the dishes, and we were already squeezed so tight into our table that it was not that pleasant. Meanwhile, Marnee was taking orders and yelling to her staff across the room. Again, we were a bit bewildered!\n\nThe food itself was okay. I had the chicken larb gai salad, which I almost always order when I go to Thai restaurants, and it was not the best I've had.

The restaurant is pretty small so I'm actually surprised that we didn't have to wait longer!\n\nAnyway, my friend and I basically figured out what we were gonna order while waiting so we can hurry up the process. We were starving! We ordered the chicken satay, chicken red curry, chicken pad see ew and thai style fried rice w/ prawns & pineapple.

I found myself back at Marnee (the topic of our discussion) on Irving, a long-standing favorite.  It was a small, mid-week meal shared by two, consisting of Calamari Salad, Green Vegetable/Tofu Curry, white rice, and tea.  It'd been at least one year since my previous visit to Marnee and many, many years since I'd been a regular patron of the place.  How many?  Ms. Marnee predicted the gender of my oldest son, now 21, when I dined there routinely for years leading up to his birth.  \n\nMarnee was once the standard bearer against which I measured every other Thai restaurant.  When I realized that none approached Marnee's stature I stopped going elsewhere.  What I loved there was what I ordered this time (all of their curries were complexly flavored, rich, and aromatic) plus Miang Kum, Chan Pad Poo (a pad Thai-like dish with sweet crab), and more.  And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but in a way that caused me to imagine I was dining in a bustling little thatched hut in Thailand.  \n\nOn this visit I noticed that the serving dishes had changed.  The Calamari Salad, which once was served on a wide flat plate, was now served in a bowl.  There seemed to be more salad-like ingredients and fewer calamari despite the rise in price.  It was still good though; spicy with complex flavors.  \n\nThe green curry though was a different story entirely.  Again, the price was more (as expected) and the serving dish had changed but these things would have made little difference if it had been excellent, as my sense-memory recalled it.  It was not.  It was warm when it should have been piping hot, watery when it should have been stick-to-the-spoon thick, and lacked the layered flavors it once had.  This is sad: Marnee was once renowned for her complex curries; whoever is making them now is not making them the same as they once were.  \n\nWhich brings me back to this:  The conversation that John S. and I were having on Marnee Thai was regarding the troubles of their second branch, on 9th Avenue (in 2013 they were briefly shuttered by the Health Department for violations).  Could it be that the original location is not keeping ingredients as fresh and clean as they once were?  Or could it be that there's just a different chef executing recipes differently and not as well as they once were?  I'll never know.  \n\nI still really like Marnee but no longer feel great raving about their curries.  And those prices?  Whew; that 2-dish dinner for 2 ran just under $30 pre-tip.  It is true, I'll likely return and eventually re-sample all those once beloved dishes.  It is also true that I'd continue to recommend Marnee to those who like Thai food.  I'm treading a little lighter this time around however.

Roasted duck with pineapple, tomatoes, bell peppers:\nThe flavor of the curry was delicious and pretty mild. It seems like the amount of coconut milk they use really mellows out the red to an almost yellow curry. Duck was really good too. The pineapples added a lot of sweetness. The large tomato wedges seemed a little out of place though.

Rice doesn't come with your meal or with the curry dishes. To me, rice & curry is like bread & butter. Curry needs a carb, just like butter needs bread.

You just have to do it because you rather avoid the meter.  Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.  My focus is the food, and I guarantee they'll dish out some really top notch Thai food.\n\nSmonkey's Tip:  ...I'm still thinking about those SPICY ANGEL WINGS...try them at least once, if not order them again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-08-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Spicy angel wings: sweet chicken wings that has a spicy kick to it\n\n4.

The beef was overcooked,  dry, and very tough, and it was served with steamed broccoli like it was a side dish. This was supposed to be a curry, onions, peppers, and other veg in a sauce. There was almost no sauce. I've been to Thai places where their curry was drowning in too much sauce (no like), but this was 180 degrees the other way.

All the years I lived in Florida, and all the Thai/Viet places we went to, I can't ever remember being charged extra for rice. My mother was Indonesian.

We got there about 8:00 for our reservation at 8:05. The place was totally full, and we had to wait a half an hour before sitting down. Service was attentive but not good (read on). So then onto the food:\n\nAppetizers:\nWe started with the Spicy Angel Wings which was the best dish all night.\nGreen Mango Salad- which was a solid interesting mango/prawn combination. \nTom Kha - Again, solid, but nothing memorable. \n\nEntrees: \nPad Thai - Just okay, again, nothing special.  We ordered two (one shrimp, one chicken) The shrimp came first, but before the chicken came...\nThe waiter mixed up our order for lamb and gave us another table's order instead of ours. When we brought it up, they just said they would just not give us the chicken pad thai to cancel the mess-up out. We didnt think that was fair because now we didnt get our lamb dish OR our pad Thai dish.  We ended up having to order our original dish again. \nBut the duck dish we received was tasty!\nPraram Phak - A peanut curry dish whos curry was too thin, and whos vegetables were lacking in flavor.\nPumpkin Curry - Again, the curry was too thin, and the dish was overall bland.\n\nDessert:\nFried Banana and Ice Cream - the banana was not hard, not soft as it should be in my opinion, and the ice cream lacking in flavor. \n\nAt the end of the night, they charged us for 2 more beers and 3 more ice teas than we actually ordered. When we pointed this out to them, they revised the check, but the revised check still had 1 ice tea and 1 beer more than we ordered. They got it right on the third try (originally the check was $166, and that was lowered to $140 when we got the correct check).\n\nI've been to quite a few Thai places, and I love Thai food, but this one was sub par in terms of food and messy in terms of service. Maybe it was a bad night, which excuses the service problems, but the food, well that doesnt really change from night to night.

(Personally Jitlada in J-Town will always be my favorite, but I digress).  My mom's motto, at a restaurant, seems to be the more the merrier, because she always more than enough food.  And with Marnee's teeny-tiny tables, the plates overrunneth.  \n\nThe Spicy Angel Wings and Pad Thai are always a must when we dine here, and they NEVER disappoint.  I'm practically licking the plate clean afterward.  \n\nThis last visit we also enjoyed the Green Papaya Salad - which was divine, the Green Curry with chicken - also yummy, and Basa Fillet with garlic and black pepper sauce (you get a choice of sauces), which was very tasty, but the fillet was too small for my liking.  Although we were stuffed, my family always makes room for dessert, and we had the white sticky rice with mango - I could eat this by the gallon.\n\nIt's best to enjoy the food and try not to have too personal a conversation, since the tables are practically on top of each other.  You can hear everything your neighbors are discussing.  There was only three of us that night, and we were seated at a 4 person table by the wall.  The servers at Marnee Thai seem to have a system of going and crossing, since there are really only two aisles from which they can walk through to get to their tables.  Regardless, service was friendly and efficient.\n\nI would give this restaurant a 5-star if it weren't for the occasional claustrophobia I feel when I dine here, or the fact that when you have to wait for a table, the space is very limited and you're regulated to standing outside, usually in very cold weather.

Look no further. I've tried quite a few Thai restaurants from San Diego to Los Angeles, and even a few up in the Bay Area, but Marnee Thai has got to be THE BEST restaurant I've been to HANDS DOWN.  I know this sounds a bit cliche, but the food is absolutely fabulous.  Here's my rule of thumb:  When trying out a new Thai restaurant, you've gotta try 3 things.  Their Papaya Salad, their Pad Thai, and one of their curry dishes.  I believe these are \"power dishes\"- the dishes that make or break the restaurant.  We started out with the Spicy Angel Wings and the Papaya Salad.  Now, if you haven't been reading anyone else's reviews, about 90% of them tell you to try the Angel Wings... there's a reason for that... trust us on this one.  The Papaya Salad is extremely light and refreshing.  It's a great way to warm up your palate for what's to come.  We then had the Kang Keaw with chicken.  This is a green curry eggplant dish.  Here's what I loved about this dish: 1) the curry is not overpowered by tons of coconut juice, and 2) the chicken (or your choice of meat) and vegetables aren't drowned in a pool of broth.  We had this with some steamed rice, and I swear... I could have eaten JUST the curry broth and rice all day long.  Of course we ordered the Pad Thai.  This is the dish that won me over.  The noodles are perfectly cooked to the right texture.  The sauce is not greasy, and the flavor has a \"home-made\" feel to it.  Definitely not like any other Thai restaurant I've been to.\n\nThe downside to this restaurant... it's small and it gets crowded.  We went on a Sunday and luckily we made reservations.  By the time we were done eating, the waiting crowd outside had amassed to about 15-20 people.  I had to squeeze my way out of the restaurant.  We were seated right next to the kitchen entrance in front of the register.  This is not a good place to sit.  In order to get to the bathroom, you gotta go through the kitchen.  So, not only were the waiters, waitresses, and bus boys trying to get in and out of the kitchen; but now we had people trying to line up to get into the bathroom!  This was semi-tolerable.  What I didn't like was the younger waiter running back and forth trying to clean and set the tables.  I understand it's busy and you're trying to accomodate your guests, but it seemed a bit unprofessional.  He was literally RUNNING inside the restaurant.  And beware: if you haven't touched one of your plates in two minutes, they may take it away.  I was resting up to go for round 2 on my curry when one of the waiters reached in to take the plate from me.  I told him I wasn't done, and he apologized.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

There is sufficient staff here...yet after flagging down practically all the waiters and waitresses to let them know that we were ready to order, we were ignored.  As a last resort, we started to do the embarrassing display of waving the hands wildly around...to which the staff pretended to have a sudden narrow field of vision that did not include the party of eight sitting in the middle of the room.  I kid you not, TWENTY MINUTES LATER, a woman came to take our order.  Apparently, this ONE woman ONLY can take orders, hence the long wait...  Why?  Good question. \n\nNow, this may not have pissed us off so much if it wasn't for what had happened earlier.  We made a reservation at 7pm.  At 6:45pm, we arrived to confirm the reservation and to just let the hostess know that the party was there and that we'll just be waiting outside.  Well...7pm came around...and went.

I've been coming here for years. I feel like i've commited a sin but taking so long to write a review.  I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

The meats were pretty chunky along with the potatoes. I would order this dish again. Pad woonsen with pork was ok. The silver noodles was good but the rest of the ingredients didn't seem to impress me since the flavor was all soaked up in the noodles. I can't remember the last dish but it was a spicy shrimp dish that wasn't spicy even though we wanted this to be more medium. All of our dishes other than the shrimp dish were supposed to be mild but they weren't even spiced as far as I could taste.

Papaya Salad, Satay, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Tom Yum, multi-colored curries etc\nThe Verdict: Unexciting and boring after years of repeated indulgence!\n\nThe foregoing is of course an awful and unfair judgment as I do recognize their popularity with the masses. While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so. This is a magnificent Thai seafood soup with sweet and sour overtones. In Marnee's rendition, the fragrant broth was the best part and the taste stemmed from the judicious use of ginger and lemon grass. The broth could be made mild or fiery depending upon your heat preference and stuffed with a good variety of fish and shellfish. I remembered imbibing this soup sold by a street vendor in Bangkok, with the heat factor being a double whammy... the heat from the soup (spiciness) and the heat from the scorching weather. But it was nevertheless gratifying, bordering on a self-inflicted masochistic perversion and a very sweaty forehead! (4/5)\n\nBeing a seafood lover, a fish dish seemed like a good idea. Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all. There were 3 different prep methods and the basa fillet topped with the spicy mushroom in curry sauce and coconut milk was our unanimous choice. We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance. Let me just describe it as a glorified hole-in-the-wall with a minimalist aesthetic approach. The bamboo panel on the left wall added some Thai flavor to the d\u00e9cor and the rest of the wall was adorned with some kitschy Thai artifacts.

I found myself back at Marnee (the topic of our discussion) on Irving, a long-standing favorite.  It was a small, mid-week meal shared by two, consisting of Calamari Salad, Green Vegetable/Tofu Curry, white rice, and tea.  It'd been at least one year since my previous visit to Marnee and many, many years since I'd been a regular patron of the place.  How many?  Ms. Marnee predicted the gender of my oldest son, now 21, when I dined there routinely for years leading up to his birth.  \n\nMarnee was once the standard bearer against which I measured every other Thai restaurant.  When I realized that none approached Marnee's stature I stopped going elsewhere.  What I loved there was what I ordered this time (all of their curries were complexly flavored, rich, and aromatic) plus Miang Kum, Chan Pad Poo (a pad Thai-like dish with sweet crab), and more.  And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but in a way that caused me to imagine I was dining in a bustling little thatched hut in Thailand.  \n\nOn this visit I noticed that the serving dishes had changed.  The Calamari Salad, which once was served on a wide flat plate, was now served in a bowl.  There seemed to be more salad-like ingredients and fewer calamari despite the rise in price.  It was still good though; spicy with complex flavors.  \n\nThe green curry though was a different story entirely.  Again, the price was more (as expected) and the serving dish had changed but these things would have made little difference if it had been excellent, as my sense-memory recalled it.  It was not.  It was warm when it should have been piping hot, watery when it should have been stick-to-the-spoon thick, and lacked the layered flavors it once had.  This is sad: Marnee was once renowned for her complex curries; whoever is making them now is not making them the same as they once were.  \n\nWhich brings me back to this:  The conversation that John S. and I were having on Marnee Thai was regarding the troubles of their second branch, on 9th Avenue (in 2013 they were briefly shuttered by the Health Department for violations).  Could it be that the original location is not keeping ingredients as fresh and clean as they once were?  Or could it be that there's just a different chef executing recipes differently and not as well as they once were?  I'll never know.  \n\nI still really like Marnee but no longer feel great raving about their curries.  And those prices?  Whew; that 2-dish dinner for 2 ran just under $30 pre-tip.  It is true, I'll likely return and eventually re-sample all those once beloved dishes.  It is also true that I'd continue to recommend Marnee to those who like Thai food.  I'm treading a little lighter this time around however.

So we planned a visit to go check it out.\n\nFirst, up front, this is a small place that tends to be completely full at peak hours, which means you'll be eating almost face to face with your stranger table mates.  This kind of dining is not for me, but for really good food, I can usually tolerate it.\n\nLast night, in particular, was rough.  We had to endure every detail of the conversation next door.  Awkward.  Crowded dining like this should be outlawed.  But, the restaurant was completely full with a line, so the food must be killer...and so the anticipation grew.\n\nHad a reservation but we waited a bit.  That seems to be the way here as I've read that in other reviews.\n\nService was pretty good despite the crowd.  The owner (I'm assuming it was the owner) mills around the restaurant giving recommendations and taking orders.  She's extremely loud and borderline obnoxious but she didn't bother me really.  A restaurant needs a character like this--it's like a mascot for a sports team.  I think she actually tries to be a bit off-putting to put on a little show.\n\nShe came to our table and didn't lower the volume.  She scolded my wife for putting too much hot sauce on her coconut hotcakes and threatened to charge us for a jar of it.  And then she smiles and laughs big.  You see?  It's hard to dislike someone like that--even if they're abrasive.  She really pushed the Angel Wings as her recommendation so we got those.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nRED CHICKEN CURRY:  Huge curry lover, but this one fell below the mark.  The sauce was fine, but the chicken was a disappointment.  Tough and dry, not like chicken should be in a curry.  No good.  Didn't eat much of this.\n\nANGEL WINGS:  I'm very picky when it comes to wings.  I only eat the drummettes and never eat the wing side.  2 of the 5 wings they served were drummettes.  I ate both of them and they were very good.  They were fried almost crispy and then sauced.  And the sauce is unique, sweet and addicting, but not spicy enough.\n\nAVOCADO + PRAWN SALAD: Big let-down as I'm a huge fan of this combination.  Avocado was not fresh, a bit discolored in fact.  Lacked salad items, no cucumber, all I tasted was cilanto and mint.  And WAY over dressed.  It was like a soup.  You get the picture.  And the kicker?  The shrimp was undercooked and inedible. This salad gets an \"F\".\n \nTHAI BEEF SALAD:  Looked appetizing when it arrived but the meat was rubbery and had that \"what kind of meat is this\" flavor and texture.  Again, inedible for me.  My wife was reluctant at first to agree with me, but after a couple bites she stopped eating it.\n\nCOCONUT HOTCAKES:  Served as an appetizer, these cute little coconut puffs are tasty.  With some hot sauce, they were enjoyable.\n\nCRAB FRIED RICE:  This was good.  Not the best I've had, but it was done right.  Best crab rice I've ever had is at HONEY THAI in Milpitas.  If this is your thing, try it at HONEY THAI. Thank me later.\n\nSTICKY MANGO RICE:  This is the second time having this dessert.  The first time, at another restaurant.  This one was pretty good.  We special ordered coconut ice cream to be served with it.  Heavenly combo.  Highly recommended.  Sticky Mango Rice needs that third element! That said, their treatment of the sticky rice component was good in flavor but not 100 percent happy with the texture.  I'm going to do make this at home and play around with getting the sticky rice just right.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nBecause I'm fond of \"hole-in-the-wall\" places like this, I wanted to like this place.  And I do like it.  HOWEVER, I think people are exaggerating the greatness of this place.  Some say it's \"the best Thai they have ever had\".  Well, maybe those folks haven't gotten around much.  I've been to Thailand and that really heightens my perspective on this place.  This is *not* the best Thai I've ever had.  It's standard, and I'm sure they have a few specialty items on the menu that would qualify for excellent.  But two of our 5 dishes were inedible for me, and that's not good.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with a 3, but honestly, I don't think I would come back.

Such hype definitely deserves a visit from my taste buds.\n\nInterestingly, there are two Marnee Thai locations in the same Outer Sunset neighborhood. One is between 23/24th street on Irving and the other is near 9th.

Not every restaurant can make good Pad Thai and I believe Marnee Thai hits the mark. It was flavorful, sauce was not overwhelming, and noodles were chewy.

While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so.

But it was nevertheless gratifying, bordering on a self-inflicted masochistic perversion and a very sweaty forehead! (4/5)\n\nBeing a seafood lover, a fish dish seemed like a good idea. Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all. There were 3 different prep methods and the basa fillet topped with the spicy mushroom in curry sauce and coconut milk was our unanimous choice. We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance. Let me just describe it as a glorified hole-in-the-wall with a minimalist aesthetic approach. The bamboo panel on the left wall added some Thai flavor to the d\u00e9cor and the rest of the wall was adorned with some kitschy Thai artifacts. Tables and chairs were packed in like sardines although the white linen and table top orchids did lend a small touch of class.

We arrived there around 1 pm and snagged \"rock star\" parking right in front of the restaurant. This was a good sign! The place was full except for two 4 tops and two small tables. The waitress/host wanted to seat us in the back a the small corner table. I asked if we could sit at the one of the 4 top tables. She rejected that request. So we took the one of the small tables next to the front door. I usually order a lot of food and I knew it would be hard to fit all of the food on a small table. But we agreed because we were hungry and we where on the way to the Asian Art Museum for the Terra Cotta Warrior exhibit. \n\nThe menu looked interesting with several specials on a separate sheet.

As we were consuming our soup the Chicken Larb came which took up all the space of the small table. So we hurried up and finished up our soup. As the waitress took away the the soup bowls the Satay Wrap came. We asked for chopsticks 3 times with 3 different servers, it was not until the 4th time did they bring them. As we started trying the wraps and the larb the Penang Pork Curry came. Sorry no more room on the tiny table. I commented to the waiter that I had asked for a larger table that remained empty. He proceeded to put another small table next to ours and rearranged all the dishes. Very intrusive that did not have to happen.\n\nFor dessert we had the Mango Sticky Rice. It was good and I could feel that the servers were feeling awkward about having put us a such a tiny table.

I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations. If you have a big party, i recommend the Irving and 9th location because they have a private room.

This is where I first decided that Tom Yum is my favorite soup. But the real stars here are the Angel Wings. They don't get better anywhere. These are simply the best Angel Wings on earth. \n\nThe lady that owns this place is a nice little lady. That first night we were there she spent some time with me teaching me how to hit the gong. She said I needed to hit the gong because it was my first time. I have had everything on this menu several times. I have never had any complaints. Everything is delicious. \n\nI've never been to Thailand but I'm willing to bet I don't have to go there to experience the best Angel Wings. \n\nBe prepared for a wait.

You can't help but be hungry from the smell of the food cooking in the kitchen. As my stomach grumbled, I peeked around at other tables and everything looked yummy. The service was also pretty nice. \nOn to the food! We decided to go family style and order a bunch of dishes.To start off, the angel wings that was highly recommended. Can't skip on them 'cuase they're succulent! Then we shared a big bowl of chicken Tom Ka which had a nice lingering spice to it. Not the best I've had, but it was pretty good for starters. The table also ordered beef Pad see ewe, the sauteed prawns and chicken curry. Everything was good. I wouldn't say spectacular, but maybe I'll have to try more dishes.

Papaya Salad, Satay, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Tom Yum, multi-colored curries etc\nThe Verdict: Unexciting and boring after years of repeated indulgence!\n\nThe foregoing is of course an awful and unfair judgment as I do recognize their popularity with the masses. While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so.

But it was nevertheless gratifying, bordering on a self-inflicted masochistic perversion and a very sweaty forehead! (4/5)\n\nBeing a seafood lover, a fish dish seemed like a good idea. Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all. There were 3 different prep methods and the basa fillet topped with the spicy mushroom in curry sauce and coconut milk was our unanimous choice. We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance. Let me just describe it as a glorified hole-in-the-wall with a minimalist aesthetic approach. The bamboo panel on the left wall added some Thai flavor to the d\u00e9cor and the rest of the wall was adorned with some kitschy Thai artifacts.

Good enough Thai food that I will gladly order something other than Pad Thai or Pad See Ew & Mr. Joy orders something other than green curry. This year marks their 30th year anniversary. One of the few times someone looks forward to 30.\n\nFrom the outside, I wouldn't expect the entire place to be covered in what looks like the bamboo mats that my grandparents sleep on. The hanging plants and stringed lights sort of give it an island feel. It's a tight space and the tables are situated very close together. The angled bamboo sheets of the faux vaulted ceiling actually makes the place feel even more claustrophobic. \n\nThere always seems to be a long line around peak times. Apparently you can call to make a reservation. The 9th Ave location is similar, but doesn't feel as claustrophobic.\n\nThai Iced Tea ($2.75): \nvery sweet. The condensed milk covers about 1/3 of the glass. The tea flavor reveals itself more as an aftertaste\n\nSpicy Angel Wings ($8.50) - deep fried chicken wings sauteed in chili-garlic sauce, topped with crispy basil:\nYes they're good. Crunchy, sweet, & spicy, like a lot of Asian-style fried chicken wings. My favorite part is the crunchy basil.\n\nThai Style Potstickers ($7.95) - pork & vegetable stuffed potstickers served with spicy green curry sauce:\npretty good potstickers with a decent crunch, topped with shredded basil leaves, curry sauce adds some flavor\n\nKang Dang/Red Curry ($13.50) - medium spicy curry with coconut milk, bamboo shoot, Thai basil. Roasted duck with pineapple, tomatoes, bell peppers:\nThe flavor of the curry was delicious and pretty mild. It seems like the amount of coconut milk they use really mellows out the red to an almost yellow curry. Duck was really good too. The pineapples added a lot of sweetness. The large tomato wedges seemed a little out of place though. The dish was topped with a little white sauce that looked like creme fraiche(?).\n\nPanang Beef ($12.95) - beef with panang curry paste, coconut milk and Thai basil, with broccoli:\nBeef cubes were nice and tender and had good flavor.\n\n*Rice costs extra. Rice doesn't come with your meal or with the curry dishes. To me, rice & curry is like bread & butter. Curry needs a carb, just like butter needs bread. You probably wouldn't want to eat straight up curry or butter on its own.\nA side of rice is about $2 per person. Some restaurants charge for rice. I prefer the ones that don't.\n\nIt's been a while since I've seen the owner, who had a ... colorful personality. \n\nOverall: good food, prices are a little high for this area, atmosphere is unique.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

So for tonight, we  took a good friend of ours out on a visit from Chicago to Marnee.  For appetizer, we began with the Mango Salad.  I am traditionally not a big fan of Thai salads, but the excellent sweet flavor of the extremely light and tangy dressing was a great compliment for digesting all those veggies and a couple of cashews along for the ride. While munching, I wondered where the Mango was, 'til my wifey told me that all that shredded noodle-looking stuff was the Mango.. d'oh!  VERY GOOD.\n\nFollowing closely behind the salad was a traditional Pad Thai.  Excellent, and nutty, with a few huge prawns poking out amongst the noodles. Bravo to the chef for NOT drowning the Pad Thai in raw bean sprouts like other places.\n\nNext up from the kitchen was #35 - the Pad Cashew Nuts w/Chicken, comprised of sauteed sliced chicken with roasted chili, cashew nuts and long slivers of onion.  The sweet yet somewhat savory sauce that came with this completely put my taste buds onto cloud nine, or ten.. DEE-LEC-TA-BLE!!  (especially over the thai rice)  This dish was the sleeper surprise.. I thought... Pad Cashew nuts?  Sounds just like a yawner Chinese Cashew Chicken (blech) from Panda Express, but NOOO... THIS IS completely GREAT!  The dark sauce reminds me of a pepper shrimp dish I had back in S'pore.  Incredible.\n\nThe following two plates rounded out our meal:\n#44: Pad Phong Ka Ree, essentially sauteed prawns and scallops in a yellow curry, with eggs, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions tossed in.   I ordered this one as \"insurance\" to ensure we got something I liked, and the scallops were pretty good sized, tender and fresh along with the very fresh shrimp.  This dish did not disappoint, and the yellow curry was light, and the natural yummy compliment to the Thai steamed rice, which was a little dry for my taste. My wife also ordered the #27: Pad Kaprow - Pork  sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basils.  Minced pork - A teeny bit dry, but still very very good especially when you found the good stuff at the bottom of the serving plate.   The flavors in this place are TOPS.. NOT greasy, and after going to a series of inconsequential/disappointing SE Asian places, Marnee is definitely what I was hoping for but never really expecting.\n\nService - pretty quick, attentive and very friendly, yet not overbearing or intruding. The owner always checked up on us, and the whole place was packed tonight, even on a semi-rainy Wednesday evening in the middle of the work week.  Due to all seats/tables being filled, we waited about 8 minutes for our table for three.\n\nI'll definitely be back!  They earned their five stars as far as I am concerned.

It's quite tasty.  We got six different dishes for our party of six, including Pad Ma Kuer, Pad Prig Pao, Gai Samoon Prai, and Chad Pad Poo, etc.  Basically sums up to a curry taste, a peanut sauce taste, and noodles and rice.

We were crammed right in the middle of the restaurant, my back literally up against someone else's back behind me.   When we asked for more rice, something weird happened.  First, they refilled our pot - but with just one scoop of rice for 6 people!  So of course, a minute later, we had to ask for another refill.  Instead of refilling our pot, they took a pot from another table they just served and dumped it on our table.  I was a little confused because I had never seen a restaurant give you a different rice bowl back from somewhere else.  What if someone had eaten out of it already, just a thought right?  I also noticed they took our old pot and switched it to somewhere else.  \n\nAnother thing I've noticed while just walking by is that they would take their garbage cans out, those dirty, disgusting, thai food smelling cans of garbage out through the FRONT of the restaurant, while people are still sitting at the tables eating.  I find that to be very disturbing.  Imagine sitting there eating, and they're wheeling all the garbage passed your table.  Sick.  \n\nAnyway, I guess I'd go back for the food if I had to, but maybe a better option is to get it to go.  Maybe then I won't have to see where or how they're cooking it.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

It was tasty like E&O but the batter was not as crispy. I did like the cucumber salad that was served with it. Yum. We had chicken larb salad which didn't really taste that great. It was salty, as if they put in a crushed chicken bouillon cube in there. I haven't come across a really good larb in the bay area. Moving on... We had Mussamun Curry Beef that was nice and smooth. The meats were pretty chunky along with the potatoes. I would order this dish again. Pad woonsen with pork was ok.

It's quite tasty.  We got six different dishes for our party of six, including Pad Ma Kuer, Pad Prig Pao, Gai Samoon Prai, and Chad Pad Poo, etc.  Basically sums up to a curry taste, a peanut sauce taste, and noodles and rice.  All were really good and you can really taste all the spices and different flavors.  They use full twigs of peppercorn in some dishes which I thought was different.  \n\nService and health issues is a totally different story.  First off, it took us at least 3 or 4 times just to ask for water.  There were about 4 servers in there and the restaurant is tiny.  We were crammed right in the middle of the restaurant, my back literally up against someone else's back behind me.   When we asked for more rice, something weird happened.  First, they refilled our pot - but with just one scoop of rice for 6 people!  So of course, a minute later, we had to ask for another refill.  Instead of refilling our pot, they took a pot from another table they just served and dumped it on our table.  I was a little confused because I had never seen a restaurant give you a different rice bowl back from somewhere else.  What if someone had eaten out of it already, just a thought right?  I also noticed they took our old pot and switched it to somewhere else.  \n\nAnother thing I've noticed while just walking by is that they would take their garbage cans out, those dirty, disgusting, thai food smelling cans of garbage out through the FRONT of the restaurant, while people are still sitting at the tables eating.  I find that to be very disturbing.  Imagine sitting there eating, and they're wheeling all the garbage passed your table.  Sick.  \n\nAnyway, I guess I'd go back for the food if I had to, but maybe a better option is to get it to go.  Maybe then I won't have to see where or how they're cooking it.

So for tonight, we  took a good friend of ours out on a visit from Chicago to Marnee.  For appetizer, we began with the Mango Salad.  I am traditionally not a big fan of Thai salads, but the excellent sweet flavor of the extremely light and tangy dressing was a great compliment for digesting all those veggies and a couple of cashews along for the ride. While munching, I wondered where the Mango was, 'til my wifey told me that all that shredded noodle-looking stuff was the Mango.. d'oh!  VERY GOOD.\n\nFollowing closely behind the salad was a traditional Pad Thai.  Excellent, and nutty, with a few huge prawns poking out amongst the noodles. Bravo to the chef for NOT drowning the Pad Thai in raw bean sprouts like other places.\n\nNext up from the kitchen was #35 - the Pad Cashew Nuts w/Chicken, comprised of sauteed sliced chicken with roasted chili, cashew nuts and long slivers of onion.

The dark sauce reminds me of a pepper shrimp dish I had back in S'pore.  Incredible.\n\nThe following two plates rounded out our meal:\n#44: Pad Phong Ka Ree, essentially sauteed prawns and scallops in a yellow curry, with eggs, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions tossed in.   I ordered this one as \"insurance\" to ensure we got something I liked, and the scallops were pretty good sized, tender and fresh along with the very fresh shrimp.  This dish did not disappoint, and the yellow curry was light, and the natural yummy compliment to the Thai steamed rice, which was a little dry for my taste. My wife also ordered the #27: Pad Kaprow - Pork  sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basils.  Minced pork - A teeny bit dry, but still very very good especially when you found the good stuff at the bottom of the serving plate.   The flavors in this place are TOPS.. NOT greasy, and after going to a series of inconsequential/disappointing SE Asian places, Marnee is definitely what I was hoping for but never really expecting.\n\nService - pretty quick, attentive and very friendly, yet not overbearing or intruding.

It's quite tasty.  We got six different dishes for our party of six, including Pad Ma Kuer, Pad Prig Pao, Gai Samoon Prai, and Chad Pad Poo, etc.  Basically sums up to a curry taste, a peanut sauce taste, and noodles and rice.  All were really good and you can really taste all the spices and different flavors.  They use full twigs of peppercorn in some dishes which I thought was different.  \n\nService and health issues is a totally different story.  First off, it took us at least 3 or 4 times just to ask for water.  There were about 4 servers in there and the restaurant is tiny.  We were crammed right in the middle of the restaurant, my back literally up against someone else's back behind me.   When we asked for more rice, something weird happened.  First, they refilled our pot - but with just one scoop of rice for 6 people!  So of course, a minute later, we had to ask for another refill.  Instead of refilling our pot, they took a pot from another table they just served and dumped it on our table.  I was a little confused because I had never seen a restaurant give you a different rice bowl back from somewhere else.  What if someone had eaten out of it already, just a thought right?  I also noticed they took our old pot and switched it to somewhere else.  \n\nAnother thing I've noticed while just walking by is that they would take their garbage cans out, those dirty, disgusting, thai food smelling cans of garbage out through the FRONT of the restaurant, while people are still sitting at the tables eating.  I find that to be very disturbing.  Imagine sitting there eating, and they're wheeling all the garbage passed your table.  Sick.  \n\nAnyway, I guess I'd go back for the food if I had to, but maybe a better option is to get it to go.  Maybe then I won't have to see where or how they're cooking it.

Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.  My focus is the food, and I guarantee they'll dish out some really top notch Thai food.\n\nSmonkey's Tip:  ...I'm still thinking about those SPICY ANGEL WINGS...try them at least once, if not order them again.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-08-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Pad Nor Mai Chicken (3/5) - Garlic, bamboo shoots, egg and basil to accompany the hero of this dish - the chicken.

We were expecting something more like Burma Superstar's mint chicken, but this had bigger chunks of chicken and lots of bamboo shoots -- and the perfect mix of chiles, garlic and basil to tie it together.\n\nMy favorite dish was the Mussamun curry -- the potatoes give it an earthiness that mixes well with the coconut curry. They nailed this dish so well that I might have trouble ordering anything else from them in the future.\n\nThe only drawback was that they took a bit longer than expected to finish my order.

Papaya Salad, Satay, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Tom Yum, multi-colored curries etc\nThe Verdict: Unexciting and boring after years of repeated indulgence!\n\nThe foregoing is of course an awful and unfair judgment as I do recognize their popularity with the masses. While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so. This is a magnificent Thai seafood soup with sweet and sour overtones. In Marnee's rendition, the fragrant broth was the best part and the taste stemmed from the judicious use of ginger and lemon grass. The broth could be made mild or fiery depending upon your heat preference and stuffed with a good variety of fish and shellfish. I remembered imbibing this soup sold by a street vendor in Bangkok, with the heat factor being a double whammy... the heat from the soup (spiciness) and the heat from the scorching weather. But it was nevertheless gratifying, bordering on a self-inflicted masochistic perversion and a very sweaty forehead! (4/5)\n\nBeing a seafood lover, a fish dish seemed like a good idea. Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all.

We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance.

My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies.

While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so.

Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all. There were 3 different prep methods and the basa fillet topped with the spicy mushroom in curry sauce and coconut milk was our unanimous choice. We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance. Let me just describe it as a glorified hole-in-the-wall with a minimalist aesthetic approach. The bamboo panel on the left wall added some Thai flavor to the d\u00e9cor and the rest of the wall was adorned with some kitschy Thai artifacts.

It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch.

So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations. If you have a big party, i recommend the Irving and 9th location because they have a private room.

Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.

", "And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but "], "author": "Tracey A.", "review": "Only weeks after an interesting discourse with fellow Yelper, John S. I found myself back at Marnee (the topic of our discussion) on Irving, a long-standing favorite.  It was a small, mid-week meal shared by two, consisting of Calamari Salad, Green Vegetable/Tofu Curry, white rice, and tea.  It'd been at least one year since my previous visit to Marnee and many, many years since I'd been a regular patron of the place.  How many?  Ms. Marnee predicted the gender of my oldest son, now 21, when I dined there routinely for years leading up to his birth.  \n\nMarnee was once the standard bearer against which I measured every other Thai restaurant.  When I realized that none approached Marnee's stature I stopped going elsewhere.  What I loved there was what I ordered this time (all of their curries were complexly flavored, rich, and aromatic) plus Miang Kum, Chan Pad Poo (a pad Thai-like dish with sweet crab), and more.  And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but in a way that caused me to imagine I was dining in a bustling little thatched hut in Thailand.  \n\nOn this visit I noticed that the serving dishes had changed.  The Calamari Salad, which once was served on a wide flat plate, was now served in a bowl.  There seemed to be more salad-like ingredients and fewer calamari despite the rise in price.  It was still good though; spicy with complex flavors.  \n\nThe green curry though was a different story entirely.  Again, the price was more (as expected) and the serving dish had changed but these things would have made little difference if it had been excellent, as my sense-memory recalled it.  It was not.  It was warm when it should have been piping hot, watery when it should have been stick-to-the-spoon thick, and lacked the layered flavors it once had.  This is sad: Marnee was once renowned for her complex curries; whoever is making them now is not making them the same as they once were.  \n\nWhich brings me back to this:  The conversation that John S. and I were having on Marnee Thai was regarding the troubles of their second branch, on 9th Avenue (in 2013 they were briefly shuttered by the Health Department for violations).  Could it be that the original location is not keeping ingredients as fresh and clean as they once were?  Or could it be that there's just a different chef executing recipes differently and not as well as they once were?  I'll never know.  \n\nI still really like Marnee but no longer feel great raving about their curries.  And those prices?  Whew; that 2-dish dinner for 2 ran just under $30 pre-tip.  It is true, I'll likely return and eventually re-sample all those once beloved dishes.  It is also true that I'd continue to recommend Marnee to those who like Thai food.  I'm treading a little lighter this time around however.  The last time a place I loved started disappointing me it was the beginning of a slippery slope that led straight to my (probably) final and generous 2-star review.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-01-27"}, {"excerpts": ["The crab noodles reminded me of a really sweet pad Thai, which I guess it was really.

The only place that I can really compare it to is Osha since it's also in SF. Even though, they're both Thai, I feel like Marnee is a bit more traditional especially when compared to the Osha Cafe's like the one in Glen Park that I frequent. Overall I felt like Marnee had better flavor and were more authentic and traditional versus the more modern Osha.\n\nAfter finding parking within a block *meant to be*, we waited for less than 20 minutes.

She took our order and was very vocal on suggestions and helpful with questions (not that we had many).\n\nA N G E L  W I N G S: The last time I was out this way, I was at San Tung trying their famous chicken wings. My GF's Mom works nearby and insisted on the Angel Wings. Now I love chicken wings and I like San Tung's but I'm definitely more of a fan of Thai food and officially a fan of Marnee's Angel Wings. The last time I had some Angel Wings at Osha, I was disappointed. Marnee's wings were deep fried and dressed with a dark red sauce. You could taste the garlic, basil and spice plus there was some peanuts for texture and nuttiness. Be careful, the wings are super hot when they come out. I could probably eat a whole appetizer with some white rice and call it a night. You must try them if you're a chicken wings fan.\n\nT O M  K H A  G A I: Also known as coconut soup with chicken, this is my favorite soup to get especially when I'm cold or sick. It came out mild but I added some peppers and took it to the next level of heat. There were so many great flavors coming out of the soup. The subtle sweetness of the coconut mixed with the lemongrass and ginger plus the spice of the Thai peppers makes this soup delish! I definitely recommend on a cold SF night.\n\nP A D  T H A I: Whenever I go to a Thai restaurant, I have to at least try their Pad Thai because it's one of Thailand's most famous and popular street food. If you have good Pad Thai, you usually have good everything else in my experience. I was not disappointed at all. Marnee's Pad Thai had the right amount of sauce and again the flavors had lots of depth and freshness. I added some prick nam blah (ask for it) and it took it to another level. Pad Thai in general is sweet and savory but when you add the Thai peppers it gives it that \"sweet heat\" that Thai food is known for. Add jasmine rice to cut the overwhelming spicy and sweetness and you're on your way to a Thai food coma!\n\nC H I C K E N  G R E E N  C U R R Y: I'm a big fan of green curry because it's usually served with some heat and it has eggplant. I've recently become a huge fan of eggplant and I was not disappointed here. The curry wasn't as creamy as I prefer but the flavors were still outstanding and rich. I mixed my curry with rice and devoured most of the curry myself. I loved the texture and taste of the eggplant with the chicken and rice.\n\nOverall the meal was outstanding. We didn't wait too long for food. It seemed as if things were flying out of the kitchen. I was really happy with the service except the drink refills (which came eventually).

I also like my Pad Thai with lots of egg, green onions and cilantro.   I still think Amarin Thai in Mountain View, or Krung Thai (multiple locations) has better Pad Thai.\n\nThe decor, however was pretty nice.

Although I am no expert, I have a pretty good idea on what good, authentic, Thai and Lao food taste like; plus I like to eat out, and have tried several different Lao/Thai restaurants.\n\nThe Thai food here is phenomenal. Starting with the hotcakes; most Thai restaurants don't offer this authentic dessert. I use to always go to the Thai temple in Berkeley to get some more authentic Thai hotcakes, but the seasoning that Marnee Thai uses makes it at least 3x better.\n\nThe Pad Thai has just enough spice, peanuts, bean sprouts, tofu, and all the other ingredients that make it a well balanced noodle dish. But it doesn't stop there, the Pumpkin Curry is probably my favorite dish. There are many options of meat such as chicken, beef, duck and more. This is a dish that I recommend enjoying with a white wine, such as a white meritage of sauv blanc & semillion ( I recommend a St. Supery Virtu).\n\nThere are so many more wonderful dishes that I can go on and on about but I won't have enough space to write about it here. If you can't have Marnee Thai everyday, every week, or every month like I can; purchase their amazing cook book by their world class chef and co-owner Chai Siriyan. He will teach you how to bring Marnee Thai to your home no matter where you live. Both he and his wife, May, are wonderful people and if you get chance to meet them you will find how  warm, charming, and humble they both are. And if you are lucky, you might be able to get your book autographed like me =).  For someone who doesn't cook, Chai's cookbook shows you how to be that Master Chef that your didn't know you were.\n\nI have had lots of great Thai food, but poor service.

I've had Thai food before at King of Thai,  I wanted to compare the taste, flavors, service, and atmosphere.  When we arrived, it was just us two and another couple.  By the time our food arrived at our table and when we left, all the seats were filled.\n\nTo start off, we ordered the Coconut Hotcakes and loved it very much.  It's 7 pieces of sizzling rice flour cakes with coconut milk, taro, and topped with corn ($7.95).  Highly recommended!\n\nNext, we ordered the traditional Pad Thai with shrimp and the Beef Fried Rice.  Both are delicious, the flavors are good and but not really for the price ($9.50 each).\n\nThe service wasn't all there.  When we ordered our food, we asked for the Hotcakes but the waiter went into the kitchen to see if they had it.  Instead of coming out of the kitchen whether or not they had it, he greeted customers coming in and seated them and then told us that they had hotcakes.  Instead of taking our complete order, he'd interrupt by seating other customers coming in.  There were two other waitresses working, so I was wondering why did they not seat customers so that our waiter could finish taking our order.  A waiter/waitress should focus on the customers on hand and have the others greet/take care of other customers.\n\nThe service was okay, our glasses were full even when we did not ask.  When we asked for the check, one of the waitresses took my credit card before providing me the bill. Luckily, the bill was correct.\n\nThe funny part is that just as I was placing my card and my copy into my wallet before I got up from my seat, the waitress said, \"Bye! Bye! Thank you!\"  I chuckled thinking, \"At least let me get up from my seat first before thanking us.\"", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-02-05"}, {"excerpts": ["I never appreciated Pad Thai till now.

After visiting Thailand for a few weeks with my wife two summers ago, we've been on the lookout for places that provide some of the regional varieties that we had around the country, and Marnee delivers on that. \n\nHaving just gotten the keys for our new house on 23rd, I wanted to grab some takeout in the new neighborhood. Thai being our goto, and with the great ratings Marnee gets on Yelp, it was a no-brainer to give them a try.

I finished it off with some Mussamun  curry. It was all piping hot when we opened it up in our empty living room, and it smelled delicious. \n\nThe wings were still too hot to touch, but I risked singed fingers to give them a try -- they were sweet, too sweet for my wife's taste in fact, and reasonably spicy. I thought they were delicious, but I was hoping for a bit more kick. \n\nThe pad nor mai was nothing like the dish we were expecting, but it was fantastic all the same! We were expecting something more like Burma Superstar's mint chicken, but this had bigger chunks of chicken and lots of bamboo shoots -- and the perfect mix of chiles, garlic and basil to tie it together.\n\nMy favorite dish was the Mussamun curry -- the potatoes give it an earthiness that mixes well with the coconut curry. They nailed this dish so well that I might have trouble ordering anything else from them in the future.\n\nThe only drawback was that they took a bit longer than expected to finish my order.

You can adjust the spiciness to your liking, but any way you prefer, the flavor is so good!  The fried crispy basil leaves are a nice complement to the dish.\n\n* Beef Satay - Thinly sliced pieces of tasty, marinated beef on a skewer which can be topped with the flavorful peanut sauce.

Again, no puddles of grease here.\n\n* Pad Kaprow - You have a choice of chicken minced pork, roasted duck or prawns/calamari.

Another favorite of mine!\n\nDessert:\n\n* Roti with Ice Cream - A thin deep fried piece of dough shaped like a flat disk that's drizzled generously with a sugary sauce and topped with a delicious scoop of coconut ice cream.  The dough is fried to a chewy consistency and when enjoyed with a bit of the ice cream . . . heaven!\n\nMarnee Thai is always a great choice for Thai food.

The owner, I assume, an overbearing woman, recommended the summer rolls even before I sat down and I was not given a menu (remember it was 10pm) so I ordered my favorite Thai dish Pad Thai with chicken. Way too much food for one person but felt obliged to agree to her suggestion as I was putting them out being it was closing time. The restaurant was still full and people seemed to be enjoying the ambience: young, trendy and very SF.\n\nThe summer rolls were not so special to write home about, mostly cucumber, bean sprouts, lettuce, not sure there was any shrimp in them as I did not see any. Maybe it was a vegetarian roll. The Pad Thai was definitely not the best I've had. As a matter of fact the chicken was very dry and tough. Very disappointed. Noodles, sauces, good. \n\nThe older lady was talking to her helpers in Thai language the whole time I was sitting at my table eating.  It was both distracting and rude. Certainly not necessary or called for. Let people eat and talk in peace. No shouting to employees in a foreign language. Kind of disconcerting.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-09-16"}, {"excerpts": ["The Spicy Angel Wings and Pad Thai are always a must when we dine here, and they NEVER disappoint.

(Personally Jitlada in J-Town will always be my favorite, but I digress).  My mom's motto, at a restaurant, seems to be the more the merrier, because she always more than enough food.  And with Marnee's teeny-tiny tables, the plates overrunneth.  \n\nThe Spicy Angel Wings and Pad Thai are always a must when we dine here, and they NEVER disappoint.  I'm practically licking the plate clean afterward.  \n\nThis last visit we also enjoyed the Green Papaya Salad - which was divine, the Green Curry with chicken - also yummy, and Basa Fillet with garlic and black pepper sauce (you get a choice of sauces), which was very tasty, but the fillet was too small for my liking.  Although we were stuffed, my family always makes room for dessert, and we had the white sticky rice with mango - I could eat this by the gallon.\n\nIt's best to enjoy the food and try not to have too personal a conversation, since the tables are practically on top of each other.  You can hear everything your neighbors are discussing.  There was only three of us that night, and we were seated at a 4 person table by the wall.  The servers at Marnee Thai seem to have a system of going and crossing, since there are really only two aisles from which they can walk through to get to their tables.  Regardless, service was friendly and efficient.\n\nI would give this restaurant a 5-star if it weren't for the occasional claustrophobia I feel when I dine here, or the fact that when you have to wait for a table, the space is very limited and you're regulated to standing outside, usually in very cold weather.

Just add mango and tomatoes. \n\nHomemade hotcakes: These are the things that were so highly reviewed on Check Please. Cute little things and good coconut and corn flavor, but not worth the price.

Looking for Thai Cuisine? Look no further. I've tried quite a few Thai restaurants from San Diego to Los Angeles, and even a few up in the Bay Area, but Marnee Thai has got to be THE BEST restaurant I've been to HANDS DOWN.  I know this sounds a bit cliche, but the food is absolutely fabulous.  Here's my rule of thumb:  When trying out a new Thai restaurant, you've gotta try 3 things.  Their Papaya Salad, their Pad Thai, and one of their curry dishes.  I believe these are \"power dishes\"- the dishes that make or break the restaurant.  We started out with the Spicy Angel Wings and the Papaya Salad.  Now, if you haven't been reading anyone else's reviews, about 90% of them tell you to try the Angel Wings... there's a reason for that... trust us on this one.  The Papaya Salad is extremely light and refreshing.  It's a great way to warm up your palate for what's to come.  We then had the Kang Keaw with chicken.  This is a green curry eggplant dish.  Here's what I loved about this dish: 1) the curry is not overpowered by tons of coconut juice, and 2) the chicken (or your choice of meat) and vegetables aren't drowned in a pool of broth.  We had this with some steamed rice, and I swear... I could have eaten JUST the curry broth and rice all day long.  Of course we ordered the Pad Thai.  This is the dish that won me over.  The noodles are perfectly cooked to the right texture.  The sauce is not greasy, and the flavor has a \"home-made\" feel to it.  Definitely not like any other Thai restaurant I've been to.\n\nThe downside to this restaurant... it's small and it gets crowded.  We went on a Sunday and luckily we made reservations.  By the time we were done eating, the waiting crowd outside had amassed to about 15-20 people.  I had to squeeze my way out of the restaurant.  We were seated right next to the kitchen entrance in front of the register.  This is not a good place to sit.  In order to get to the bathroom, you gotta go through the kitchen.  So, not only were the waiters, waitresses, and bus boys trying to get in and out of the kitchen; but now we had people trying to line up to get into the bathroom!  This was semi-tolerable.  What I didn't like was the younger waiter running back and forth trying to clean and set the tables.  I understand it's busy and you're trying to accomodate your guests, but it seemed a bit unprofessional.  He was literally RUNNING inside the restaurant.  And beware: if you haven't touched one of your plates in two minutes, they may take it away.  I was resting up to go for round 2 on my curry when one of the waiters reached in to take the plate from me.  I told him I wasn't done, and he apologized.  So for the down side of the restaurant, I had to retract a star from my rating.  But overall... I highly recommend!!!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-07-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Their seasonal appetizers (Hotcakes) were perfect, and the Pad Thai was the best I've ever had :).

However, for some reason BofA took a few additional days to post the voided charges and the 3rd, correct charge, so when I checked my statement 3 days after we ate at Marnee Thai all I saw were two charges one after the other, neither for the correct amount!  \n\nTo make amends for the angel wings issue, the owner also offered us a \"credit\" for an appitizer next time we come in.

We looked at each other thinking - wow, we're coming back!  A few minutes later a plate of wings arrived at our table.  At the end of the evening the check came . . .\n\nYou guessed it, we were billed for the Angle Wings.  Honestly, neither of us was surprised.  We're not naive.  Perhaps we should have inquired about whether they were going to be on the house.  Regardless, I don't feel this is the customer's burden.  We were offered something because they had \"extra\" of a favorite dish, and we said yes.  Oh well.  \n\nHere's the kicker - checked my bank account today and discovered they charged us twice!  One charge for $46.50 and another for $46.  I called about an hour ago and am waiting for the owner to call me back.

We arrive on time, wait for about 5 minutes, then are shown a table. There are only 6 settings and chairs. We clarify that there are 8 of us. They tell us to go back outside and wait.  10 minutes later we're ushered back in. This time there are 8 place settings and only 5 chairs. A mild improvement. We stand around and the place is packed. It's probably over capacity in there, and i'm taking the opportunity to look around at what everyone else is eating ;). We finally flag down someone about the chair situation. The chairs trickle in. Slowly. We order quickly and watch as 2 other tables get shifted about. People who are seated are asked to move to other tables so they can rearrange. It seemed very disorganized, and would only fly at an Asian restaurant. On the plus side, the food basically came flying out. The tip is automatically calculated for parties of 6 or more, so there was no way to make a subtle comment about the wierd mixup with the table or having to stand around without chairs. 2.5 stars.\n\n2. The food.\nFinally I understood why I waited around so awkwardly. The food is pretty darn good! We went with Yelpers' recommendations and tried the papaya salad, green curry with beef and eggplant, angel wings and pad thai with shrimp. I was surprised that the angel wings weren't stuffed like other angel wings i've had before, but they were crispy and sweet.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree.

Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

I remember once having a ground chicken salad in a spicy/herbal marinade that was the stuff of poetry and song.  But that was two years ago.   Last Sunday my family and I were all in the mood for some palate stimulating Thai, so what better place than Marnee Thai, right?  Wrong.\n\nI remember the days of being greeted there by dainty Thai ladies dressed in those beautiful shimmery outfits, the kinds that make us ordinary western women feel like circus elephants.   This time, we were greeted and served by some woman of an entirely different ethnicity, who bluntly hurried us to order and then got all the orders wrong.  \n\n    My daughter, whose culinary adventures do not yet go to very exotic extremes, opted for ordinary Pad Thai.  Can't go wrong with that, right?  Wrong again.   These noodles were overcooked and simmered in a sauce consisting of loads of ketchup and vinegar and a dash of spices.  The chicken pieces in it were tiny and sparse, loaded in a more than generous amount of grease.\n\n   As she ate, I had ordered the coconut/chicken soup for the three of us, intending to think about my second dish while I slowly savored all the complex flavors of the soup.   However, I was soon to discover that this bowl was so small it was a joke to share with three people, but I did, and was left with a tiny bit of liquid in my tiny bowl and a few small pieces of chicken.   The other adult in our group was also taking his time trying to decide on his second dish, so he ordered a cup of coffee in the meantime.  A few sips afterward he tells me he thinks this is instant coffee.   I glanced up and saw that by the tiny kitchen they did indeed have a large jar of cheap, dollar store brand instant coffee.  Later, a trip to the bathroom where you have to cross the entrance to the kitchen, confirmed my eyes had not deceived me.   Honestly, wouldn't it be better for a restaurant to say they don't have coffee than to offer disgusting, chalky instant coffee?  But apparently these folks think that as long as they can charge for it, reputation be dammed.\n\n   We were so disgusted by everything we were experiencing that we just decided not to order anything else.  After getting our undeservingly overpriced bill, we left and headed for Clement street, where we went to Clement Dim Sum and satisfactorily put an end to our hunger.\n\n   So much for Marnee Thai - - and yet one more that bites the dust!", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-08-23"}, {"excerpts": ["Pad thai is also really good and dare I say the best in the city."], "author": "Sophia C.", "review": "So I've been to Marnee Thai 20 times already but haven't yelped so here goes.

Ive not really ever seen that at an asian place, at least not the sauce you find on the table. Hopefully thatll be a good forebearance of what is to come! \n\nThe soup arrived in a cute but oddly shaped bowl. At first glance two things came to mind 1) thats a lot of oil floating in it and 2) thats a big half order of soup. The soup was very tasty. Lots of mushrooms and chicken. There was also a lot of lemongrass and ginger in it, garnished with cilantro. While eating the ginger is fine i would recommend not eating the lemongrass as it takes 50 chews to break it down enough to eat.\n\nNow the pad thai has arrived, it looked delicious, premixed for my pleasure, missing lime again though. Maybe thats a west coast thing? It smells delicious.\n\nFirst impressions. Everything tastes really good, a nice sweetness to it and a robust flavor with properly prepared noodles. Here is the downside, i asked for thai spicy, and i got mild. I reiterated it twice, she said she understood. Unfortunately this loses this restaurant a star.\n\nWell, i gotta give this place two stars. Becuase the only feeling i have right now is Meh.

So for tonight, we  took a good friend of ours out on a visit from Chicago to Marnee.  For appetizer, we began with the Mango Salad.  I am traditionally not a big fan of Thai salads, but the excellent sweet flavor of the extremely light and tangy dressing was a great compliment for digesting all those veggies and a couple of cashews along for the ride. While munching, I wondered where the Mango was, 'til my wifey told me that all that shredded noodle-looking stuff was the Mango.. d'oh!  VERY GOOD.\n\nFollowing closely behind the salad was a traditional Pad Thai.  Excellent, and nutty, with a few huge prawns poking out amongst the noodles. Bravo to the chef for NOT drowning the Pad Thai in raw bean sprouts like other places.\n\nNext up from the kitchen was #35 - the Pad Cashew Nuts w/Chicken, comprised of sauteed sliced chicken with roasted chili, cashew nuts and long slivers of onion.  The sweet yet somewhat savory sauce that came with this completely put my taste buds onto cloud nine, or ten.. DEE-LEC-TA-BLE!!  (especially over the thai rice)  This dish was the sleeper surprise.. I thought... Pad Cashew nuts?  Sounds just like a yawner Chinese Cashew Chicken (blech) from Panda Express, but NOOO... THIS IS completely GREAT!  The dark sauce reminds me of a pepper shrimp dish I had back in S'pore.  Incredible.\n\nThe following two plates rounded out our meal:\n#44: Pad Phong Ka Ree, essentially sauteed prawns and scallops in a yellow curry, with eggs, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions tossed in.   I ordered this one as \"insurance\" to ensure we got something I liked, and the scallops were pretty good sized, tender and fresh along with the very fresh shrimp.  This dish did not disappoint, and the yellow curry was light, and the natural yummy compliment to the Thai steamed rice, which was a little dry for my taste. My wife also ordered the #27: Pad Kaprow - Pork  sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basils.  Minced pork - A teeny bit dry, but still very very good especially when you found the good stuff at the bottom of the serving plate.   The flavors in this place are TOPS.. NOT greasy, and after going to a series of inconsequential/disappointing SE Asian places, Marnee is definitely what I was hoping for but never really expecting.\n\nService - pretty quick, attentive and very friendly, yet not overbearing or intruding. The owner always checked up on us, and the whole place was packed tonight, even on a semi-rainy Wednesday evening in the middle of the work week.  Due to all seats/tables being filled, we waited about 8 minutes for our table for three.\n\nI'll definitely be back!  They earned their five stars as far as I am concerned.   Oh, and forget those one-review-hatchet-naysayers.  And nope.

Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.

I found myself back at Marnee (the topic of our discussion) on Irving, a long-standing favorite.  It was a small, mid-week meal shared by two, consisting of Calamari Salad, Green Vegetable/Tofu Curry, white rice, and tea.  It'd been at least one year since my previous visit to Marnee and many, many years since I'd been a regular patron of the place.  How many?  Ms. Marnee predicted the gender of my oldest son, now 21, when I dined there routinely for years leading up to his birth.  \n\nMarnee was once the standard bearer against which I measured every other Thai restaurant.  When I realized that none approached Marnee's stature I stopped going elsewhere.  What I loved there was what I ordered this time (all of their curries were complexly flavored, rich, and aromatic) plus Miang Kum, Chan Pad Poo (a pad Thai-like dish with sweet crab), and more.  And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but in a way that caused me to imagine I was dining in a bustling little thatched hut in Thailand.  \n\nOn this visit I noticed that the serving dishes had changed.  The Calamari Salad, which once was served on a wide flat plate, was now served in a bowl.  There seemed to be more salad-like ingredients and fewer calamari despite the rise in price.  It was still good though; spicy with complex flavors.  \n\nThe green curry though was a different story entirely.  Again, the price was more (as expected) and the serving dish had changed but these things would have made little difference if it had been excellent, as my sense-memory recalled it.  It was not.  It was warm when it should have been piping hot, watery when it should have been stick-to-the-spoon thick, and lacked the layered flavors it once had.  This is sad: Marnee was once renowned for her complex curries; whoever is making them now is not making them the same as they once were.  \n\nWhich brings me back to this:  The conversation that John S. and I were having on Marnee Thai was regarding the troubles of their second branch, on 9th Avenue (in 2013 they were briefly shuttered by the Health Department for violations).  Could it be that the original location is not keeping ingredients as fresh and clean as they once were?  Or could it be that there's just a different chef executing recipes differently and not as well as they once were?  I'll never know.  \n\nI still really like Marnee but no longer feel great raving about their curries.  And those prices?  Whew; that 2-dish dinner for 2 ran just under $30 pre-tip.  It is true, I'll likely return and eventually re-sample all those once beloved dishes.  It is also true that I'd continue to recommend Marnee to those who like Thai food.  I'm treading a little lighter this time around however.

I came in for dinner and away from the streets I was taken into a settled thai ambiance. The interior was shaped like a hut, look up to the ceiling and you'll see what I mean. The whole place was wrapped with bamboo or straw and decorated with exotic plants. Humble soft instrumental music was playing. I felt like I was in the tropics.\n\nAfter narrowing down my choices, I came down to Angel sticky wings for appetizers, chan pad poo for the entree and mango with sticky rice for dessert. Service was quick and the wait staff was very attentive, my water was refilled nearly every 2 - 3 mins. The wait staff even checked up on us too which is rare compared to the asian cuisine I've tried so far in SF.\n\nThe angel sticky wings were delish!!!! Holy moly, I don't know what sauce it is but it's finger licking good!!!! I loved the crispy leaves that was topped over the wings. Tip: while ordering any spicy dish, be careful with the level of spice. I got mild and I was still able to taste the spiciness on my lips afterward.\n\nThe chan pad poo was just as amazing. The noodles were soft and tender, there was a lot of flavors in the dish. It was piping hot while served and still hot while I ate it. Steam was coming out the whole time. Yet it didn't burn my tongue. The only flaw with the dish would be the lack of peanuts but that's because I always love having peanuts in my thai dishes. It feels like a necessity.\n\nLastly, the grand finale, the mango sticky rice. It was a savory chunk of sticky rice drizzled with coconut sauce and paired with a generous serving of freshly sliced mango. The combination of both sticky rice and mango was delectable. The sauce was a great compliment for the mango as well.\n\nAnother note, this is the FIRST restaurant I've tried in San Francisco that had the aroma of the food flowing from the dish itself. I smelled the wings while the waitress was walking toward me. The food was also served right off the grill yet it was still warm enough to eat! Such perfect timing.\n\nGiven in mind for the price and quality, Marnee is off the roof. They give 5+ stars quality and service for a small and reasonable price. This is definitely one of my favorite thai restaurants of ALL TIME.\n\nMarnee holds the quality of everything a thai restaurant should be. Authentic, flavorful and spicy.\n\nSo if you're in the area, skip all those chinese restaurants. It's a waste of money and time. Come to Marnee for an authentic experience and phenomenal thai cuisine. I promise you, you'll be taken to another place the moment you step in.

And note to all this is the second time I have been here but the review is based on my most recent visit considering the last time I was here was 5-6 years ago.\n\nLuckily when we came in we were seated immediately. The place settings here include a spoon and fork, so my friend asked for chopsticks. I find it kind of odd that they only had a place setting of only a spoon and fork, usually they had chopsticks as well. Not a big deal since we got the chopsticks. The waitress gave us water with lime inside, very refreshing, however it did take them a while to refill my water.\n\nWe started out with Golden Triangles, which contained pumpkin, potato, and curry in a skin very similar to fried wontons or samosas. It tasted very much like samosas (which is one of my favorite Indian food appetizers). It was on the spicy side but I didn't care because it tasted delicious. I am not a huge fan of spicy foods but I made this an exception and if I come back this will definitely be on my appetizer list.\n\nI ordered Pad Se-Ew, in my opinion it seemed more flavorful here than at other Thai restaurants I have been to. Also I like that they put regular broccoli in it rather than Chinese broccoli. My friend ordered Chan Pad Poo, yes weird name but it was actually pretty good, it contained crab and he ordered it a little spicy ( too spicy for me so I only had a little). \n\nOur eating experience was very good, our palates were definitely satisfied. However like I said before the water wasn't refilled as quickly as I would have liked, by the time the appetizers came I was almost finished with my water and it took them until after I was serving seconds on my entr\u00e9e when they gave me more water. They weren't even busy, so I don't know why they lagged on the water. That is basically why I am not giving this restaurant  5 stars.

Papaya Salad, Satay, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Tom Yum, multi-colored curries etc\nThe Verdict: Unexciting and boring after years of repeated indulgence!\n\nThe foregoing is of course an awful and unfair judgment as I do recognize their popularity with the masses. While I love Thai cuisine, the ubiquitous presence of these usual suspects in most Thai restaurants is beginning to bore me. I picked Marnee Thai for a reason. It is not just another Thai restaurant. It does have all the usual suspects and then some.\n\nThai salad dressings are pretty generic. They are mostly an appetizing blend of refreshing, zesty flavors.  My taste buds tell me that whisking lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and ginger was the secret to most delectable Thai dressings. Instead of the hugely popular papaya salad, I opted for the cooked Calamari Salad ($8.95). The salad was fantastic with finely sliced red onions, lettuce and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro. The star was of course the calamari, which believe it or not was tender instead of being chewy or rubbery. Imo, portion was skimpy and had there been more pieces of calamari to include tentacles, this would have been a perfect salad! (3/5)\n\nTom Yum is common whereas Po Tak ($11.95) is less so. This is a magnificent Thai seafood soup with sweet and sour overtones. In Marnee's rendition, the fragrant broth was the best part and the taste stemmed from the judicious use of ginger and lemon grass. The broth could be made mild or fiery depending upon your heat preference and stuffed with a good variety of fish and shellfish. I remembered imbibing this soup sold by a street vendor in Bangkok, with the heat factor being a double whammy... the heat from the soup (spiciness) and the heat from the scorching weather. But it was nevertheless gratifying, bordering on a self-inflicted masochistic perversion and a very sweaty forehead! (4/5)\n\nBeing a seafood lover, a fish dish seemed like a good idea. Well, not just any fish like salmon or catfish but maybe a fish native to Thailand. Basa Fillet ($13.95) popped right out in the Chef's Suggestion. Basa is indigenous to Indochina, which included Thailand. It is a white fish, mild in taste with a soft and flakey texture. Although classified as a catfish, it does not have any muddy taste, not at all. There were 3 different prep methods and the basa fillet topped with the spicy mushroom in curry sauce and coconut milk was our unanimous choice. We ordered it mild so everyone can savor how the pan seared basa could be such a culinary delight. (5/5)\n\nThere isn't much to talk about on the ambiance. Let me just describe it as a glorified hole-in-the-wall with a minimalist aesthetic approach. The bamboo panel on the left wall added some Thai flavor to the d\u00e9cor and the rest of the wall was adorned with some kitschy Thai artifacts. Tables and chairs were packed in like sardines although the white linen and table top orchids did lend a small touch of class. Service was pretty ho hum throughout our entire meal and we felt neglected especially since we were the only other table at 4pm.", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-05-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Pad kee mao is seriously a few ingredients...ive never had to wait this long for thai food...for food in general.

"], "author": "Arnold T.", "review": "Street parking in the avenues isn't fun at times.  You just have to do it because you rather avoid the meter.  Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.

Each roll is about twice as long as spring/summer rolls I have seen elsewhere!\n\nThe pumpkin curry was delicious! My absolute favorite. I've had it elsewhere and this is as good or better here. I love that they add peas to the curry. I didn't expect it to come with tofu. The tofu is fried which also is not my favorite, but it was ok.

The sticky rice here at Marnee Thai is more separated, and not as gooey and stuck together as the one at Mandalay. The mangoes were soft and sweet, so that's a plus. White coconut sauce was poured on top of the sticky rice so this gave it an extra kick to it.

Upon walking in, the amazing smell of Thai food enveloped us, and the place was packed, so much so that the only table left is the one next to the kitchen entrance, and we took it.

It was pretty awkward, because the couple next to us was seated uncomfortably close. I was sitting closer to the stranger next to me than my date across the table. Our 2 tables were only like 1-2 inches apart so it was basically a communal table. And to the other side of us, they tried to squish a 5 person group in a 4 person table so sometimes when I ate, my hand would accidentally bump into the back of the person sitting in the other table. Another minus is that when we ordered, our waitress (she might have been the owner?) kept pushing us to order another special they had that I didn't want to the point where it made me feel kind of awkward and I had to make up a fake excuse that I didn't like taro lol.\n\nBut onto the food!

They also put a tiny bit of coconut milk on top and it was perfect!\n- Pad Thai: I was craving noodles, so I got the Pad Thai but it was just alright, very average. I wouldn't recommend it, because there are much better dishes here that you can get. The flavor was okay, but there wasn't enough eggs.

I wouldn't mind this if it tasted like the mango fried rice I had before, but it definitely didn't!  It was saltier, yet less flavorful, and the rice was harder and drier because they had to cook it longer after they added the ingredients.

The wings had a nice glaze to them but they were not spicy at all.\n~ Pad Thai: one of the better Pad Thais that I've had...their shrimp were nice and succulent (not overcooked at all) and they actually had tofu in it too =)\n~ Spicy Thai Style Fried Rice with Chicken: They don't normally make it spicy but they were able to accommodate my request as I was craving spicy foods.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very spicy but you can pick up hints of cayenne and pepper.  The rice was very flavorful and not too greasy, which is the problem with a lot of Thai fried rice dishes.

I found myself back at Marnee (the topic of our discussion) on Irving, a long-standing favorite.  It was a small, mid-week meal shared by two, consisting of Calamari Salad, Green Vegetable/Tofu Curry, white rice, and tea.  It'd been at least one year since my previous visit to Marnee and many, many years since I'd been a regular patron of the place.  How many?  Ms. Marnee predicted the gender of my oldest son, now 21, when I dined there routinely for years leading up to his birth.  \n\nMarnee was once the standard bearer against which I measured every other Thai restaurant.  When I realized that none approached Marnee's stature I stopped going elsewhere.  What I loved there was what I ordered this time (all of their curries were complexly flavored, rich, and aromatic) plus Miang Kum, Chan Pad Poo (a pad Thai-like dish with sweet crab), and more.  And I liked their interior too, which was kind of kitschy and crowded but in a way that caused me to imagine I was dining in a bustling little thatched hut in Thailand.  \n\nOn this visit I noticed that the serving dishes had changed.  The Calamari Salad, which once was served on a wide flat plate, was now served in a bowl.  There seemed to be more salad-like ingredients and fewer calamari despite the rise in price.  It was still good though; spicy with complex flavors.  \n\nThe green curry though was a different story entirely.  Again, the price was more (as expected) and the serving dish had changed but these things would have made little difference if it had been excellent, as my sense-memory recalled it.  It was not.  It was warm when it should have been piping hot, watery when it should have been stick-to-the-spoon thick, and lacked the layered flavors it once had.  This is sad: Marnee was once renowned for her complex curries; whoever is making them now is not making them the same as they once were.  \n\nWhich brings me back to this:  The conversation that John S. and I were having on Marnee Thai was regarding the troubles of their second branch, on 9th Avenue (in 2013 they were briefly shuttered by the Health Department for violations).  Could it be that the original location is not keeping ingredients as fresh and clean as they once were?  Or could it be that there's just a different chef executing recipes differently and not as well as they once were?  I'll never know.  \n\nI still really like Marnee but no longer feel great raving about their curries.  And those prices?  Whew; that 2-dish dinner for 2 ran just under $30 pre-tip.  It is true, I'll likely return and eventually re-sample all those once beloved dishes.  It is also true that I'd continue to recommend Marnee to those who like Thai food.  I'm treading a little lighter this time around however.

Why didn't I come back? Probably because I lived in a different part of the city and didn't venture out to the sunset? \n\nWell, now that I am calling the neighborhood home again, we decided to give Marnee Thai a shot. This was our second time ordering take-out. We have yet to eat-in the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered a lot of different dishes this time: \n\n--papaya salad\n--summer rolls (basically spring rolls with a different name)\n--green curry dumplings (I'm gluten-intolerant; my husband ate these)\n--pad kee mao (sp?)\n--pumkin curry \n--panang beef curry (I didn't eat this, as it looked thickened with flour)\n--mussaman curry  (I also didn't eat this)\n\nAs I mentioned, I'm gluten-intolerant so I ate the items that I felt comfortable eating. I\"m pretty sure the food was not 100% gluten free but for the most part, no issues.  The papaya salad was a great starter and not too sweet or sticky, as I've had at other places. The summer rolls are great. I had a tiny bit of peanut sauce (although it's usually not gluten-free) and it was yum. The summer rolls come in 2's and are fairly large. Each roll is about twice as long as spring/summer rolls I have seen elsewhere!\n\nThe pumpkin curry was delicious! My absolute favorite. I've had it elsewhere and this is as good or better here. I love that they add peas to the curry. I didn't expect it to come with tofu. The tofu is fried which also is not my favorite, but it was ok. (I'm not sure if their fried tofu is gluten free? but I chanced it...)\n\nI also chanced it and had the Pad Kee Mao since they were rice noodles. It's possible the spicy sauce they use may contain gluten. It was delicious but I may stick to curries in the future to be safe.\n\nMy husband enjoyed the other dishes also. We will definitely be back. Wish they delivered for those lazy nights, but it's not so bad picking up. The only problem is that it is usually very crowded on Friday nights, so try to order early or come when you know the food will already be done. Otherwise you will be waiting in a small space by the door where tons of people are coming in and going out.  The service is not as friendly either as I saw for people dining in...the girl who worked there had me wait in the drafty hallway by the kitchen.

(This was my \"pre-pescatarian\" diet that I'm currently on.\" The curry was perfect, and warmed the heart (and the sweat glands) with a zing of spice. The wings, OMG, were divine. You will have to ask for extra napkins and then a few more because WOW are those suckers covered in the delicious Thai-something glaze. The thai iced tea was good, sweet, and I wanted more of it.\n\nThis time around, there were 5 in our group and they seated us promptly for our 8pm reservation. [Tip: make a reservation - they honor them and will save you time.] We decided to go family style this time and ordered 5 dishes for the table.

While the curry was good, I thought the egg, which was probably thrown-in too early, created a strange texture of liquid-y curry + small fine chunks of egg. Flavour was great though!\n\nOverall, this is a solidly \"Thai-rrific\" four-star Thai place.

I couldn't find the name of the restaurant (it wasn't really visible from the street), but Marnee Thai came up with great reviews, and it was just down the block. \n\nI loved the interior decor! Walls were decorated floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall with bamboo-like material. It made you feel like you were in a cozy hut. Wait staff were well-dressed with their Thai-style dresses or shirts.

We ordered the chicken with string beans in chili paste and sauteed eggplant with tofu (the bf LOVES fried tofu. Actually, he likes anything fried!), both of which were indicated as spicy on the menu.\n\nThe chicken with string beans was cooked just right with slightly crunchy string beans and bite-size chicken slices. The chili paste gave the dish a great flavor, but made it a little oily. The eggplant dish was tasty as well. However, neither dish had any spice to them! Maybe I wasn't loud or clear enough when I told the fast-speaking waitress \"spicy.\" Or maybe I missed something she said when she was taking our order? I forget - my rumbling stomach was starting to take over my body, who knows what I said.\n\nAs we finished our meal, the place was starting to fill up at 7pm on a Saturday night.

It's nice that they have 3 different meat choices (beef, pork or chicken), a choice for prawns, and a vegetarian option (generally tofu, which is still delicious), so at least with the curries, you could have it go pretty much your way. \n\nGenerally when I go with my family or a group of friends we order the chicken satay (the peanut sauce is TO DIE FOR) and another appetizer, usually the Golden Triangles which are like samosas filled with a curried sweet potato mixture, which are also amazing. \n\nThe service is friendly, and pretty vigilant (filling your water glass when it runs low, or promptly coming over if signaled).

Just add mango and tomatoes. \n\nHomemade hotcakes: These are the things that were so highly reviewed on Check Please. Cute little things and good coconut and corn flavor, but not worth the price.

On the plane ride here, my bf marked all the restaurants near my apt that sounded worth visiting. Marnee Thai on Irving was one of these. Last night, famished, we made our way to Marnee to try it out. Upon walking in, the amazing smell of Thai food enveloped us, and the place was packed, so much so that the only table left is the one next to the kitchen entrance, and we took it. The waitstaff is super friendly, all wearing authentic Siam clothing (I guess?) which says a lot considering the women's skirts are ankle length.\n\nDecor- da bomb. The walls are covered in bamboo-esque wood, large embroidered hangings throughout the room, and fresh orchids on each table. The orchids alone made me love the place. On the back wall the daily specials are posted, but also provided on a menu on each table. We ordered the imperial rolls to start, and then I got the green curry (medium spice) with tofu and steamed rice for entree and my bf the pad kee mao with duck. Rolls were good, came with a spicy sauce to dip them in. \n\nOur entrees- I ate almost all of the pad kee mao. My curry wasn't really spicy OR sweet enough, considering the coconut milk, and the eggplant was a little too mushy for my taste. I've never ordered green curry before, so this is no fault of the restaurant and I'll stick to red/yellow in the future! The pad kee mao- so effing good. Perhaps this is because we got it with duck (da bomb) but the spiciness was just right for me. It came with sliced fresh tomatoes as well, a perfect contrast to the drunk noodles and duck. \n\nI was all ready to rate this as my go-to Thai restaurant in Sunset, however then the bill came. We were charged $1.50 for each scoop of steamed rice for my curry- a first in my 10+ years of eating Thai food. It escapes me as to how you are supposed to eat curry if not with rice to soak it up with? I was just shocked that rice wasn't included in the dish, and even more so that each tiny scoop was $1.50. I will revisit Marnee Thai, but will ask if rice is included in whatever I order.

They have lunch specials but they dont come with soup as im used to thai lunch specials having. While the soup is meant for two they will let you get a half order (though the waitress couldnt tell me how much it would cost). As is usual for my first time at a thai place i ordered the pad thai. Looking at the tables of others it looks really good. One of the first impressions that i got from the place was the hot sauce they serve. It looks completely fresh, like they made it themselves. Ive not really ever seen that at an asian place, at least not the sauce you find on the table. Hopefully thatll be a good forebearance of what is to come! \n\nThe soup arrived in a cute but oddly shaped bowl. At first glance two things came to mind 1) thats a lot of oil floating in it and 2) thats a big half order of soup. The soup was very tasty. Lots of mushrooms and chicken. There was also a lot of lemongrass and ginger in it, garnished with cilantro. While eating the ginger is fine i would recommend not eating the lemongrass as it takes 50 chews to break it down enough to eat.\n\nNow the pad thai has arrived, it looked delicious, premixed for my pleasure, missing lime again though. Maybe thats a west coast thing? It smells delicious.\n\nFirst impressions. Everything tastes really good, a nice sweetness to it and a robust flavor with properly prepared noodles. Here is the downside, i asked for thai spicy, and i got mild. I reiterated it twice, she said she understood. Unfortunately this loses this restaurant a star.\n\nWell, i gotta give this place two stars. Becuase the only feeling i have right now is Meh.

At this point, Mrs. Siriyarn sat down next to us (something I've never seen before) to take our orders.

After having lived in northern Thailand for over three years I have long searched for a Thai restaurant in the U.S. that serves a lot of the dishes that I miss and do it without losing the flavor.  Marnee Thai has done that and more.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nSome of the unique dishes you MUST try are the Morning Glory (it's vegan too!).  That was a staple while I lived in Thailand and was absolutely delicious last night.  There are actually some ascetic Buddhist monks who live on only morning glory... or so I'm told.  Not sure how they do that...\n\nAlso the Kao Pote Tawt (corn fritters -- also vegan) are hard to find elsewhere and were pretty good.  They didn't have as much flavor as I remember but they were nice and crispy so they must have hot oil.\n\nNext are the \"kah-nome kroke\".  I can't remember what they called them on the menu... maybe coconut and rice crispy patties / pancakes or something like that?  They don't look exactly like they do in Thailand but they definitely nailed the flavor.  These are little coconut fritters with green onions, corn and coconut cream served on top.  They consist of flour, sugar, and coconut, so they're basically like a dessert.  The Thais usually eat them as a snack in the morning.  These are also vegan, by the way.\n\nThe soy protein salad (make sure to tell them no fish sauce if you want it vegan) was very tasty.  We also ordered the vegetarian samosas (vegan), which are not Thai but were very good.  I've not seen either of these dishes at other Thai restaurants.\n\nThe Hanglay curry is not vegan (might be able to be made so -- I didn't ask) but is an authentic northern Thai dish that I've not seen anywhere else.  If you want to try something different, this is a good one to try.\n\nFinally, another one for the non-vegans, is the Haw Mok.  This is a delicious egg / coconut / meat and curry souffle served inside a banana leaf.  It's pretty incredible and hard to find at other Thai places.\n\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nThey take reservations and large parties (we had 9 in ours).\n\nThe seating is pretty tight.  It's a small little restaurant and everyone is packed together pretty tight.  I didn't mind, but if you are claustrophobic or are looking for something a little more quiet and private, this is not the place.\n\nThe owner is probably one of the highlights of this place.  She is loud and definitely let's you know she runs the show, but she's also very sweet.  We did a birthday party and she got everyone in the restaurant to sing for our friend.  We gave one of our cupcakes to the spirit of the restaurant as good luck, at her recommendation, which brought back fond memories of doing this in Thailand.\n\nShe also told all of our fortunes.

The interior of the place is lined with woven reed mats and there are old school Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling, and beer bottles lining the interiors of the planters. Definitely a smaller, different vibe from the 9th street location.\n\nWe are vegetarian and ordered the corn hotcakes, green papaya salad, pad see ew noodles, green pumpkin curry, and tofu praram.\n\nGreen papaya salad was standard. The pad see ew was delicious and perfect and had cauliflower in it which we enjoyed -- we judge and compare thai restaurants by this dish and they passed with flying colors. The corn hotcakes were not fritters, or really anything like pancakes, as one might expect-- they were closer to quiche or flan in consistency and tasted like coconut. We enjoyed the flavor of the pumpkin curry immensely, but wished it had more pumpkin in it.

I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations.

Pad prik pao pork and hong lay pork tasted good but lacked some intensity in flavours.

I\"m pretty sure the food was not 100% gluten free but for the most part, no issues.  The papaya salad was a great starter and not too sweet or sticky, as I've had at other places. The summer rolls are great. I had a tiny bit of peanut sauce (although it's usually not gluten-free) and it was yum. The summer rolls come in 2's and are fairly large. Each roll is about twice as long as spring/summer rolls I have seen elsewhere!\n\nThe pumpkin curry was delicious! My absolute favorite. I've had it elsewhere and this is as good or better here. I love that they add peas to the curry. I didn't expect it to come with tofu. The tofu is fried which also is not my favorite, but it was ok. (I'm not sure if their fried tofu is gluten free? but I chanced it...)\n\nI also chanced it and had the Pad Kee Mao since they were rice noodles. It's possible the spicy sauce they use may contain gluten. It was delicious but I may stick to curries in the future to be safe.\n\nMy husband enjoyed the other dishes also. We will definitely be back. Wish they delivered for those lazy nights, but it's not so bad picking up. The only problem is that it is usually very crowded on Friday nights, so try to order early or come when you know the food will already be done. Otherwise you will be waiting in a small space by the door where tons of people are coming in and going out.  The service is not as friendly either as I saw for people dining in...the girl who worked there had me wait in the drafty hallway by the kitchen.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

After we revved up our appetites on the hills with the stunning views, we headed for this restaurant. I recalled many times I was unable to try it out, due the daunting long lines out the door. I rejoiced as the line was much shorter & the older woman in the lacey top kept coming out tracking us. The line was moving quickly. After about 15 minutes or so, we were seated in a middle, cramped space, sitting with strangers with no real privacy.  We ordered our drinks, the lady in the lace top suggested we try coconut cakes & pretty much ordered them for us, Hmmmm. We felt was cramped in and then our drinks were served hot (soda). Our pot stickers were some of the best we have ever had, delicately flavored and perfect! This was the best part of our meal! And then, I took an adventure to get the hor mok, a steamed seafood custard, only served on weekend, that I had read about on the Internet. It came out rather quickly to my surprise, only to be cold, and then what I realized later, was frozen in the middle. It had a kind of a thawed out strange texture and stale taste. It certainly was not freshly made! Much later I wondered had it been micro waved and/or thawed out and warmed up somehow for assembly line type service.  Was I in a fast food joint was an afterthought? I was trying to eat it as best I could, but had to stop. And then, my boyfriend got the red curry with prawn, thinking he wasn't being too adventurous, too\" authentic.\" And then, the string beans had a strange thawed out frozen strange texture, & it was in the form of a thin soupy sauce. (He had not ordered soup!!). And then, he noticed a strange flavor, and then the prawns were rubbery, not even fresh. Even the brown rice was dry and flavorless like cardboard, stale and dry, not freshly made!  We could not be mistaken about the rice!!! We know what rice tastes like!  It all seemed like frozen food that was micro waved! We did not realize this until we left completely disappointed at this \"Zagat\" rated restaurant.

What I eventually determined that the food was not prepared in a fresh manner, nor was it true to the traditions of most Thai and San Francisco food preparation standards.\n\nWe wrote a letter finally after many calls requesting our money back. We were too polite to ask then and there as we should have.  Our food was inedible. I spoke with the manager Ms. Jen multiple times (3-4 times.) She promised her manager Mr. Chai would call me back. He never did and then he finally did and yelled at me, admitted the food was not freshly prepared and blamed it on a busy day! (It was not THAT BUSY). He blamed for me not asking for a refund then and there & still refused to refund me out money, even though I had called multiple times and they didn't return my calls.  He caused me of eating the food and then wanting my money back  (Not true, I still have the entire dish which I took home in the fridge, yuk!)

The soft shell crab was the right texture, and did not become soggy from the salad. The dressing was light and flavorful. Great starter. \n\nCoconut hot cakes with corn -- my first time trying these as recommended by the owner. Somewhat savory, somewhat sweet. They come in little portions (7 per order) and come out piping hot. I enjoyed the homemade chili sauce on top of these. I would have liked the texture of these to be a little more consistent -- almost felt undercooked inside even though it was crispy on the outside. \n\nMiang kam (spinach leaves with dried shrimp, peanuts, ginger, lime, coconut, sauce) -- a rare find on a North American Thai menu. A fun bit of work putting together these bite-sized snacks. \n\nHong lay pork stew with pineapple -- this was okay. Instead of my typical red curry chicken or chili basil beef, I gave in to trying something new. I found it to be more sweet than savory due to the pineapple. \n\nPad prig pao pork -- this was okay. Flavors were nice, but would have been nice to have this a little more saucy. \n  \nBrown rice -- hearty and wild. I really liked this. $2 for a small bowl. \n\nMango sticky rice -- pretty good. \n\nThai iced tea -- best I've had in years. \n\nPrices were okay, service was good.

The meats were pretty chunky along with the potatoes. I would order this dish again. Pad woonsen with pork was ok. The silver noodles was good but the rest of the ingredients didn't seem to impress me since the flavor was all soaked up in the noodles.

The waitress/host wanted to seat us in the back a the small corner table. I asked if we could sit at the one of the 4 top tables. She rejected that request. So we took the one of the small tables next to the front door. I usually order a lot of food and I knew it would be hard to fit all of the food on a small table.

I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations.

Next came the Panang Beef was a little tougher than I would like it but the curry helped to round out the dish. I also would have liked it if they gave a little more curry sauce.

Overall I felt like Marnee had better flavor and were more authentic and traditional versus the more modern Osha.\n\nAfter finding parking within a block *meant to be*, we waited for less than 20 minutes.

Someone else on yelp referred to the elder Thai running the restaurant as \"Mama Thai.\" I don't know if that's her nickname but it fits.

She took our order and was very vocal on suggestions and helpful with questions (not that we had many).\n\nA N G E L  W I N G S: The last time I was out this way, I was at San Tung trying their famous chicken wings. My GF's Mom works nearby and insisted on the Angel Wings. Now I love chicken wings and I like San Tung's but I'm definitely more of a fan of Thai food and officially a fan of Marnee's Angel Wings. The last time I had some Angel Wings at Osha, I was disappointed. Marnee's wings were deep fried and dressed with a dark red sauce. You could taste the garlic, basil and spice plus there was some peanuts for texture and nuttiness. Be careful, the wings are super hot when they come out. I could probably eat a whole appetizer with some white rice and call it a night. You must try them if you're a chicken wings fan.\n\nT O M  K H A  G A I: Also known as coconut soup with chicken, this is my favorite soup to get especially when I'm cold or sick. It came out mild but I added some peppers and took it to the next level of heat. There were so many great flavors coming out of the soup. The subtle sweetness of the coconut mixed with the lemongrass and ginger plus the spice of the Thai peppers makes this soup delish! I definitely recommend on a cold SF night.\n\nP A D  T H A I: Whenever I go to a Thai restaurant, I have to at least try their Pad Thai because it's one of Thailand's most famous and popular street food. If you have good Pad Thai, you usually have good everything else in my experience. I was not disappointed at all. Marnee's Pad Thai had the right amount of sauce and again the flavors had lots of depth and freshness. I added some prick nam blah (ask for it) and it took it to another level. Pad Thai in general is sweet and savory but when you add the Thai peppers it gives it that \"sweet heat\" that Thai food is known for. Add jasmine rice to cut the overwhelming spicy and sweetness and you're on your way to a Thai food coma!\n\nC H I C K E N  G R E E N  C U R R Y: I'm a big fan of green curry because it's usually served with some heat and it has eggplant. I've recently become a huge fan of eggplant and I was not disappointed here. The curry wasn't as creamy as I prefer but the flavors were still outstanding and rich. I mixed my curry with rice and devoured most of the curry myself. I loved the texture and taste of the eggplant with the chicken and rice.\n\nOverall the meal was outstanding. We didn't wait too long for food. It seemed as if things were flying out of the kitchen. I was really happy with the service except the drink refills (which came eventually).

And it was not a disappointment, but i was definitely not impressed also. \n\nWe came in early on Sunday for dinner, so we were seated right away. But right away, people started to wait outside in front of the restaurant. We had angel wings and satay chicken for appetizers. Angel wings were delicious, very flavorful and crispy on the outside. This is my favorite. Chicken satay was typical. What they had differently was the lettuce to wrap chicken with satay peanut sauce. At other restaurants, there are usually just the chicken skewers with sauce and pickles. \n\nWe ordered panang curry chicken, pad kee mao, mango fried rice, tofu eggplants for entrees. Panang Curry was different, and I didn't like it. It was served on a plate instead of a bowl. There were a lot of meat (chicken in this case) and very little of the curry part. I normally had Panang curry with majority of the curry, so I could pour curry over my rice (: But here at Marnee Thai, there was barely any curry for you. It was more like chicken saut\u00e9ed with curry sauce. Failed.  Pad Kee Mao was not as spicy as how Pad Kee Mao typically is, but I have no problem with it since I'm not a fan of super spicy. However, I would prefer the thicker & wider noodles. Mango fried rice- this is the first time I had mango fried rice. The fried rice is good but not OMG or WOW. The rice was not too dry or too mushy. It was perfectly cooked. The touch of mango gave the dish a special and unique flavor. Tofu eggplants - I thought this dish was only okay here. There were mostly eggplants and very few tiny pieces of tofu. The flavor is good. Another highlight of this restaurant is the dessert Roti Ice Cream. We've ordered Sticky Rice with Mango and Roti Ice Cream for desserts. The Mango Sticky Rice was very very good. But I almost always found this dessert at any Thai restaurant, and they always make it super good. For the Roti Ice Cream, this  is the first time I tried. It is actually a very clever combination. Fried crispy dough or \"roti\" sprinkled with some condensed milk and topped with vanilla ice cream. It is similar to fried ice cream. It is very different and very good. \n\nService was good.

I love that they add peas to the curry. I didn't expect it to come with tofu. The tofu is fried which also is not my favorite, but it was ok. (I'm not sure if their fried tofu is gluten free? but I chanced it...)\n\nI also chanced it and had the Pad Kee Mao since they were rice noodles. It's possible the spicy sauce they use may contain gluten. It was delicious but I may stick to curries in the future to be safe.\n\nMy husband enjoyed the other dishes also. We will definitely be back. Wish they delivered for those lazy nights, but it's not so bad picking up. The only problem is that it is usually very crowded on Friday nights, so try to order early or come when you know the food will already be done.

First, they refilled our pot - but with just one scoop of rice for 6 people!  So of course, a minute later, we had to ask for another refill.  Instead of refilling our pot, they took a pot from another table they just served and dumped it on our table.  I was a little confused because I had never seen a restaurant give you a different rice bowl back from somewhere else.  What if someone had eaten out of it already, just a thought right?  I also noticed they took our old pot and switched it to somewhere else.  \n\nAnother thing I've noticed while just walking by is that they would take their garbage cans out, those dirty, disgusting, thai food smelling cans of garbage out through the FRONT of the restaurant, while people are still sitting at the tables eating.  I find that to be very disturbing.  Imagine sitting there eating, and they're wheeling all the garbage passed your table.

I feel like i've commited a sin but taking so long to write a review.  I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations. If you have a big party, i recommend the Irving and 9th location because they have a private room.

And it was not a disappointment, but i was definitely not impressed also. \n\nWe came in early on Sunday for dinner, so we were seated right away. But right away, people started to wait outside in front of the restaurant. We had angel wings and satay chicken for appetizers. Angel wings were delicious, very flavorful and crispy on the outside. This is my favorite. Chicken satay was typical. What they had differently was the lettuce to wrap chicken with satay peanut sauce. At other restaurants, there are usually just the chicken skewers with sauce and pickles. \n\nWe ordered panang curry chicken, pad kee mao, mango fried rice, tofu eggplants for entrees. Panang Curry was different, and I didn't like it. It was served on a plate instead of a bowl. There were a lot of meat (chicken in this case) and very little of the curry part. I normally had Panang curry with majority of the curry, so I could pour curry over my rice (: But here at Marnee Thai, there was barely any curry for you. It was more like chicken saut\u00e9ed with curry sauce. Failed.  Pad Kee Mao was not as spicy as how Pad Kee Mao typically is, but I have no problem with it since I'm not a fan of super spicy. However, I would prefer the thicker & wider noodles. Mango fried rice- this is the first time I had mango fried rice. The fried rice is good but not OMG or WOW. The rice was not too dry or too mushy. It was perfectly cooked. The touch of mango gave the dish a special and unique flavor. Tofu eggplants - I thought this dish was only okay here. There were mostly eggplants and very few tiny pieces of tofu. The flavor is good. Another highlight of this restaurant is the dessert Roti Ice Cream. We've ordered Sticky Rice with Mango and Roti Ice Cream for desserts. The Mango Sticky Rice was very very good. But I almost always found this dessert at any Thai restaurant, and they always make it super good. For the Roti Ice Cream, this  is the first time I tried. It is actually a very clever combination.

"], "author": "Kate S.", "review": "I went to Marnee Thai while visiting San Francisco this past Sunday evening with my boyfriend. We were meeting my sister and her family, but we got there early and held a table while we waited. We were lucky to get there when we did (at 6PM) because we only had to wait for about 3 minutes to be seated; shortly thereafter, there was a line out the door!\n\nWe sat down and ordered appetizers while we waited. We had the chicken satay wraps and the summer rolls. The summer rolls were delicious, but they had more rice noodle in them that I would have liked (usually I like more vegetable); however, they were fresh and tasty overall. The satay was great--it was unique in that they were wraps (served with big leaves of butter lettuce, bean sprouts and cold rice noodles), which made it fun!\n\nWhen my sister arrived, it turned out that she had brought more people than expected, so we had to change tables in this very crowded restaurant. The head waitress accommodated us, but not without letting us know what an inconvenience it was. She was a bit abrasive, but had complete control over the situation, which we appreciated.\n\nWhen the waitress took our order, it was a bit chaotic (to say the least). We had some questions, but she didn't give us time to ask them; instead, we were rushed through and some of us were even passed over as she skipped immediately to the table next to us. It was pretty odd, and left us dazed and confused.\n\nFor additional appetizers, our group shared the coconut hot cakes, which had been recommended to us by a friend of my sister's. They looked like deviled eggs and came hot off the griddle, topped with some corn kernels, ham, and some sauce. They were pretty tasty, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our entrees (and the line outside was growing longer), we saw May (Marnee) enter the restaurant and take complete control. She walked from table to table like she owned the place, and indeed! She does! Quite a presence.\n\nOur food arrived in a completely arbitrary order--obviously they just brought it out as it was ready. There was no room on the table for all the dishes, and we were already squeezed so tight into our table that it was not that pleasant. Meanwhile, Marnee was taking orders and yelling to her staff across the room. Again, we were a bit bewildered!\n\nThe food itself was okay. I had the chicken larb gai salad, which I almost always order when I go to Thai restaurants, and it was not the best I've had. The mint/cilantro/lime flavors were delicious, but the ground chicken meat was not the best quality. My beau had the pad see ew, which he says was uninspired. The other members of our party seemed to enjoy their roast duck and sea bass, but I didn't get a good description from them because the atmosphere was not at all conducive to conversation.\n\nWe were stuffed and ready to go (in fact, one of our waitresses was bringing us the bill), when Marnee/May alit on our table like hawk. She told us that her roti dessert was amazing, and insisted that we order it. In fact, it was impossible to refuse; what a businesswoman! The dessert was just fried dough with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I didn't care for it and it tasted like oil, but the 12 year old in our group scarfed it down.\n\nFinally, we squeezed our way out of our tight table configuration. Obviously the place is popular, because it was brimming with enthusiastic diners, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Perhaps if it had been less chaotic it would have been a more pleasant experience, but this was a bit much. We were afraid to ask questions and felt forced to order a dessert that we didn't want, and unable to order the things we did want. However, if you do go, make sure to either make a reservation or go a bit early.\n\n(Also, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting; the floor and the toilet seat wwere completely wet, and I don't really want to know what they were wet from, and the garbage can was overflowing with paper towels.

You can adjust the spiciness to your liking, but any way you prefer, the flavor is so good!  The fried crispy basil leaves are a nice complement to the dish.\n\n* Beef Satay - Thinly sliced pieces of tasty, marinated beef on a skewer which can be topped with the flavorful peanut sauce.  No complaints for being greasy since the beef is lean and tender.  A favorite!\n\nEntrees:\n\n* Pad Thai - The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted.  The noodles are just the right chewy consistency and the flavor is perfect with it's level of sweetness.  Again, no puddles of grease here.\n\n* Pad Kaprow - You have a choice of chicken minced pork, roasted duck or prawns/calamari.  I always order the minced pork that's sauteed with fresh chili garlic and Thai basil.  The flavor is so distinct and blends so perfectly with the white rice.  Another favorite of mine!\n\nDessert:\n\n* Roti with Ice Cream - A thin deep fried piece of dough shaped like a flat disk that's drizzled generously with a sugary sauce and topped with a delicious scoop of coconut ice cream.  The dough is fried to a chewy consistency and when enjoyed with a bit of the ice cream . . . heaven!\n\nMarnee Thai is always a great choice for Thai food.

Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day. There is another location on 9th Ave, but this one tastes the best in my opinion. 5 stars all across the board!", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-10-27"}, {"excerpts": ["but dont forget to try the Roti served with ice cream.

I've been coming here for years. I feel like i've commited a sin but taking so long to write a review.  I never had a dish i did not like.  I love the corn cakes the best! It's like a fried corn patty and it's sweet, you have to order this if you love corn.  The pad thai and pad see ew are both great dishes to get for lunch. I also love their crab fried rice, they do give you lots of crab and the fried rice is never too mushy.  And if you haven't read in the rest of their 978 reviews already, you have to try their angel wings. It's similar to the ones at San Tung except that it's sweet and spicy. So they give the chicken a little kick.  Just a word of warning, this dish will get your hands sticky and will give you a challenge if you are using the fork and knife to eat it. \n\nYou can ask for the level of spiciness on some dishes. Such as the tom yum soup and the curry dishes.  Just make sure you can handle it.  the tom yum soup is sour, just the way i like it.  We asked them to make it a little more spicy and it was perfect, especially on a cold winter day. They also add a lot of ingredients in the soup.  The green curry is just as good as the yellow curry. I suggest if you are a curry fanatic to get the green curry instead.  It has more spices to it. \n\nMy favorite dish is the pad param  with is a dish with chicken, spinach and peanut sauce.  I can never get tired of eating this dish.  it's cooked and blended together so well and it goes perfectly over rice. They have a new item on their menu this year that is the traditional hotcakes. This is cooked in a griddle and it comes out in the griddle.  It's a coconut with corn, onions and pumpkin so it's kind of like a pudding. You can order it as a appetizer or as a dessert. If you get it as a dessert they will make it sweeter.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, i recommend the Mango with sticky rice or the roti with ice cream.  If you are a mango lover you can't go wrong with the mango and sticky rice. The portion is kind of big to me so i recommend sharing it. The roti with ice cream is so good.  I love funnel cake so i might be biased. So this is exactly like a funnel cake to me and they top it off with coconut ice cream. \n\nAs for drinks, if you want to order a thai ice tea or thai coffee you can always as them to make it less sweeter.  I usually ask for my thai ice coffee to be less sweet.  The young coconut drink is ok, but if you are expecting the drink to be sweet you might be disappointed. It's more of a refreshing drink than a sweet drink.  You can always ask for a spoon to scoop all the coconut out.  The thai beer here taste like the chinese beer that i've tried before. I ordered a 7up to make a shandy out of it.  So i got to play a little bartendering.  \n\nI have yet to try a dish at this place that i don't like. I recommend reservations at both locations.

So we planned a visit to go check it out.\n\nFirst, up front, this is a small place that tends to be completely full at peak hours, which means you'll be eating almost face to face with your stranger table mates.  This kind of dining is not for me, but for really good food, I can usually tolerate it.\n\nLast night, in particular, was rough.  We had to endure every detail of the conversation next door.  Awkward.  Crowded dining like this should be outlawed.  But, the restaurant was completely full with a line, so the food must be killer...and so the anticipation grew.\n\nHad a reservation but we waited a bit.  That seems to be the way here as I've read that in other reviews.\n\nService was pretty good despite the crowd.  The owner (I'm assuming it was the owner) mills around the restaurant giving recommendations and taking orders.  She's extremely loud and borderline obnoxious but she didn't bother me really.  A restaurant needs a character like this--it's like a mascot for a sports team.  I think she actually tries to be a bit off-putting to put on a little show.\n\nShe came to our table and didn't lower the volume.  She scolded my wife for putting too much hot sauce on her coconut hotcakes and threatened to charge us for a jar of it.  And then she smiles and laughs big.  You see?  It's hard to dislike someone like that--even if they're abrasive.  She really pushed the Angel Wings as her recommendation so we got those.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nRED CHICKEN CURRY:  Huge curry lover, but this one fell below the mark.  The sauce was fine, but the chicken was a disappointment.  Tough and dry, not like chicken should be in a curry.  No good.  Didn't eat much of this.\n\nANGEL WINGS:  I'm very picky when it comes to wings.  I only eat the drummettes and never eat the wing side.  2 of the 5 wings they served were drummettes.  I ate both of them and they were very good.  They were fried almost crispy and then sauced.  And the sauce is unique, sweet and addicting, but not spicy enough.\n\nAVOCADO + PRAWN SALAD: Big let-down as I'm a huge fan of this combination.  Avocado was not fresh, a bit discolored in fact.  Lacked salad items, no cucumber, all I tasted was cilanto and mint.  And WAY over dressed.  It was like a soup.  You get the picture.  And the kicker?  The shrimp was undercooked and inedible. This salad gets an \"F\".\n \nTHAI BEEF SALAD:  Looked appetizing when it arrived but the meat was rubbery and had that \"what kind of meat is this\" flavor and texture.  Again, inedible for me.  My wife was reluctant at first to agree with me, but after a couple bites she stopped eating it.\n\nCOCONUT HOTCAKES:  Served as an appetizer, these cute little coconut puffs are tasty.  With some hot sauce, they were enjoyable.\n\nCRAB FRIED RICE:  This was good.  Not the best I've had, but it was done right.  Best crab rice I've ever had is at HONEY THAI in Milpitas.  If this is your thing, try it at HONEY THAI. Thank me later.\n\nSTICKY MANGO RICE:  This is the second time having this dessert.  The first time, at another restaurant.  This one was pretty good.  We special ordered coconut ice cream to be served with it.  Heavenly combo.  Highly recommended.  Sticky Mango Rice needs that third element! That said, their treatment of the sticky rice component was good in flavor but not 100 percent happy with the texture.  I'm going to do make this at home and play around with getting the sticky rice just right.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nBecause I'm fond of \"hole-in-the-wall\" places like this, I wanted to like this place.  And I do like it.  HOWEVER, I think people are exaggerating the greatness of this place.  Some say it's \"the best Thai they have ever had\".  Well, maybe those folks haven't gotten around much.  I've been to Thailand and that really heightens my perspective on this place.  This is *not* the best Thai I've ever had.  It's standard, and I'm sure they have a few specialty items on the menu that would qualify for excellent.  But two of our 5 dishes were inedible for me, and that's not good.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with a 3, but honestly, I don't think I would come back.  If this place was in my area, I would use it as a take-out place for certain dishes, the Angel Wings and the Crab Fried Rice etc.\n\nYes, overrated in my humble opinion but that happens occasionally, especially when a place like this gets some airtime on TV.\n\nI'm not a hater, just someone who is keeping it real!", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-08-04"}, {"excerpts": ["We finished off with a Roti with coconut ice cream.

I must say however, that it didn't live up to the hype. Maybe it was the time we went, or what we ordered but we were both expecting an amazing experience.\n\nWe ordered:\nSpicy Angel Wings -- this dish was gooey, sticky, crispy and sweet like honey, but not as spicy as I anticipated since \"spicy\" is part of the dish's name.  I felt that the sauce that it came in was a little too thick and overpowering. I had burnt finger tips from handling this hot (temperature-wise) dish.  The meat was tender but again, I think the sauce really overpowered any chicken flavor. \n \nSimmered Pork Randang Curry -- tender pork with lots of flavor. The sauce or curry was scarce and a little runny for my liking though since I like to pour sauce all over my rice.\n\nMango Fried Rice with Chicken -- came with big chunks of chicken, mango and eggs. I thought this dish alone didn't have much flavor. It lacked sweetness from the mango and any real depth. I had to add some of the sauce they had on their table to give it any flavor.  \n\nDessert:\nRoti with coconut ice cream -- SOOOOOOOO freakin' delicious! It got the right textures of crisp, gooey softness, and firmness. It was not overly sweet. It had great coconut flavor which mixed well with the sweetness of the condensed milk drizzled over the roti. I wanted this one all to myself AND order another. If it were based on this dessert alone, I would've happily given Marnee Thai 4 stars!\n\nService was OK. It took them a few minutes to get us menus and take our drink orders. They refilled our waters when they got low without us having to ask. However, they brought out the food too quickly. We were still working on our hot chicken wings when they brought out our other two dishes which were initially steaming but had cooled off considerably when we finally got to them.\n\n I wonder if Marnee Thai has a back door since other reviewers have commented on them taking their trash out through the front door.

Sadly, the quality of the food has gone down hill, and now they're just a mediocre Thai place that's just as good as, but no better than the King of Thai restaurants. \n\nThe angel wings, once the highlight of my meal, are no longer smothered in the oh-so-delicious sauce. Sure it's tossed in the sauce, but it's nothing like before, when there was so much sauce that any holes between the succulent wings were covered.  Now there's not enough sauce, and they're just plain old wings. \n\nThe Pad Kee Mao was also a disappointment. It was overly sweet. Where's the spice? Where's the kick? Marnee Thai is still a Thai place afterall, right? \n\nThen there was the bland bland Thai Fried Rice. Again, no spice, no kick :( The only tasty thing was the pineapples, which I'm sure came from a can. \n\nSigh . . .

The noodles are just the right chewy consistency and the flavor is perfect with it's level of sweetness.  Again, no puddles of grease here.\n\n* Pad Kaprow - You have a choice of chicken minced pork, roasted duck or prawns/calamari.

For those who have been here, Marnee may sound loud and she is, but her words, directed to the staff and kitchen, will be adhered a lot quicker than writing alone. She's the boss and brains of her two locations. Her husband, the award winning master Thai chef, is the backbone in devising succulent savory dishes that command praise and honor from foodies alike. Some of his most noteworthy creations include Fresh Egg Rolls, Angel Wings, Pad Thai, Basa Fillet, Pad Cha Talay, and Pad Phone Ka Ree. Several pictures and newspaper articles of these awards are posted inside the restaurant along the entrance walls. \n\nIf you walk towards the restroom in the back, you will notice several framed article clippings about Marnee Thai and Marnee herself. Marnee is well-known for her fortune telling and providing an accurate read about your personality. Because this may be a frightening experience to some, others will learn she tells a lot of truth behind her words. My wife and I have been bringing several friends and family to the Irving Street location for the past 10 years and introduced everyone to Marnee. We've had 3 good and bad reads from Marnee and I would like to share them with you: \n1) When my wife and I were engaged, we went to eat at Marnee Thai and Marnee read both our personalities. She said my fiance was the hot headed one and I was the water that cools her; in Thai it was translated to be Fire and Ice. Marnee said that I was the best one for her and not to let me go. Maybe that's the reason why she agreed to marry me. We both compliment each other in more ways than one. \n2) We brought good friends at the time that we used to party with every weekend to the restaurant. I bugged my wife to ask Marnee for a reading of the other couple and so she did. I remember her translation to my wife and I not worry about the other couple and worry about ourselves. We are no longer speaking to other couple due to disagreement and a bad change of behavior on their part. That was 2 years ago. \n3) During our engagement, we lived in Roseville and commuted on weekends to San Francisco and San Jose for wedding preparations. Since we ate at Marnee Thai on a monthly basis, we became good friends with Marnee and her husband. We invited them to our wedding and they accepted. While seated at the wedding, Marnee gave one of our good friends, who worked as a temp for Rocklin's Hewlett Packard, a reading. She told him that new opportunities will open for him and the next one he gets he should take it. He told us what Marnee said, didn't think much of it, and thought it was entertaining. Six months later, we heard the Rocklin HP was downsizing and laying-off people. We received a phone call from our friend and he said he accepted a permanent job from HP and has to relocate to Texas. He also mentioned that it was exactly like what Marnee told him as his fortune at our wedding. We were all shocked. To this day, he still works for HP and is very happy. \n\n*Life's paths and destinations work in mysterious ways. If you believe in fortune telling, I would definitely seek Marnee's services. She does palm reading as a side business. \n\nSorry to get sidetracked, but back to the Thai food. Every time we go to Marnee Thai, we order enough food to feed 5 people even though there are just 2 of us. We always order Green Papaya Salad with crab and two chilies, Spicy Angel Wings, Beef Salad, Fresh Egg Rolls, Pad Se-Ew, Pad Prig Pao pork, Pad KaProw chicken, and Steamed Jasmine Rice. The Angel Wings are not your typical named appetizer because they are different than traditional stuffed chicken ones. They're fried wings covered in a garlic and tamarind sauce. My mouth waters even before I start eating them because the aroma is to die for. For drinks, we get ice water, an iced Thai Coffee no milk, and an iced Thai Ice Tea. For dessert, we get either the Mango Sticky Rice or Roti with ice cream. \nThe staff is very attentive and will help you with any questions you may have in finding alternatives due to preference or food allergies. Great Thai cuisine, great customer service, and great location. What else do you need? \n\nMarnee Thai is my number one Thai food destination in San Francisco. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a good experience. HINT: Make reservations. If you don't, you will most likely end up waiting a couple of hours depending on the day.

You just have to do it because you rather avoid the meter.  Stepping out into the cold air and as the mini trek over to Marnee Thai is finished; we see a car right in front of the restaurant just pull out.  Also, today was a Sunday.  Meters were free by that time too.  Bad luck and stupidity all rolled in one.\n\n[PALM TO THE FOREHEAD]\n\nThat night we were dining with a couple friends.  Amongst half chatter and half looking over the menus, requests for our order came.  \"Are you ready to order?\" the waitress asked in a slightly abrasive tone yet with a hint of politeness.  I think she was the boss.  If she wasn't, she at least had the aura of one.  \"Sorry...one more minute...almost ready...\" we replied back.  This was a common occurrence with me at Marnee or any Thai restaurant for that matter.  This was the second time we had to repel the waitress away.  \n\nFor simplicity sakes I'll just go over what we ate this visit.  Our friend said the SPICY ANGEL WINGS were gnarly delicious.  So we had to get a plate of those.  Staying away from the usual pad thai, we ventured for another selection from the noodle section.  It came down between the fun to say, chan pad poo or PAD KEE MAO.  We chose the latter.\n\nNo Thai dinner at our table would be complete without a curry, and we got the yellow curry.  They have a fancy name for that it, KANG KA REE.  It's probably not fancy in reality, it just sounds like it to me.  To round things out I picked the PAD NOR MAI.  For sake of ease, I pointed and called out the number on the menu, \"#42\".  \n\nSpicy Angel Wings:  The fried chicken wings were excellent!  Crispy outside, coated with a finger licking special chili garlic sauce.  Too bad I had to share.  \n\nPad Kee Mao:  Who doesn't like wide noodles like this?  Everyone likes them.  Great part is consistency all over all the noodles.  There weren't any patchy parts missing any chili, garlic, sweet Thai basil combo they have cooked in there.  \n\nKang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry):  We chose pork.  The ingredients labeled in the description do not taste exactly like your normal yellow curry.  Mildly spiced, not mildly flavored, and Marnee unique; they don't mess around with the run of the mill yellow curry.  As the waiter came to take away the almost finished curry bowl away, I said \"Wait\".  I proceeded to finished spooning out the remaining curry sauce onto my rice.  \"Ok, you can take it away now. Thanks.\"    \n\nPad Nor Mai:  Simplicity of the description on the menu compared to the actual aromas the of the dish tells you otherwise.  Choosing the shredded chicken I was afraid the flavors wouldn't flow throughout the meats.  Boy I was way wrong.  Layers of all the ingredients were cooked throughout the dish.  I'll give it two thumbs up and two bonus big toes up.  \n\nI've convincingly decided Marnee Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Every time I come here and everything we order.  It is a winner.  The GOLDEN TRIANGES (THAI SAMOSAS) and the plate you can't go wrong with, PAD THAI.  This is always a sure fire hit with Bun.

So we flagged down the lady and asked her to take it back and spice it up some more. She said no problem and went to the kitchen to bring up back a jar of the pickled chilies they have. The green ones that are hot and sour. We kinda stared at her and wondered what the hell was wrong with her as she proceeded to tell us to mix the chilies in for extra spiciness. We were not amused at this point and asked her to make the dishes the way we wanted them. So she took them back to the kitchen and she came back and apologized for the mix up and her actions telling us that she takes pills and sometimes she gets like that. \n\nOne, never tell the patrons that you are on meds to keep yourself \"normal\".
