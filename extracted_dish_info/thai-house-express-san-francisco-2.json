Pretty much anything can be made with tofu, and my friends ended up with piles of various vegetables on top of brown rice.  They looked (and, I'm told, were) super good.  We also got spring rolls and, perhaps to compensate for being so darn healthy, the corn cakes.  Not being one to pass up curry, I got the gang koor goong: shrimp in red curry, pineapples, tomatoes, and basil.  The spring rolls were deliciously average, the corn cake was deliciously fried (and a refreshing change of pace!), and the curry held its own quite well.  It was creamy with a little heat as I was anticipating, but I was a little disappointed by the amount of delightful chunky bits in my curry - it looked a bit more like soup, though it did taste excellent over the rice.\n\nThe service was really quite alright once we were seated, and I'm mostly content with the prices - Thai House Express could charge for ambiance if it wanted to, but they don't and I appreciate that very much.

The decor is rather bare-bones, though the hip-looking people in their skinny-looking jeans and chunky-looking glasses tend to provide most of the visual stimulation.  And we had a lot of time to look around, as the wait for a table was surprisingly long.  We were given menus and were able to order ahead of time, which was nice.  But another group of the same size was seated first, even though they arrived after us, which was a little less nice.\n\nThe menu was extensive, and very vegetarian-friendly.  Pretty much anything can be made with tofu, and my friends ended up with piles of various vegetables on top of brown rice.  They looked (and, I'm told, were) super good.  We also got spring rolls and, perhaps to compensate for being so darn healthy, the corn cakes.  Not being one to pass up curry, I got the gang koor goong: shrimp in red curry, pineapples, tomatoes, and basil.  The spring rolls were deliciously average, the corn cake was deliciously fried (and a refreshing change of pace!), and the curry held its own quite well.  It was creamy with a little heat as I was anticipating, but I was a little disappointed by the amount of delightful chunky bits in my curry - it looked a bit more like soup, though it did taste excellent over the rice.\n\nThe service was really quite alright once we were seated, and I'm mostly content with the prices - Thai House Express could charge for ambiance if it wanted to, but they don't and I appreciate that very much.

The decor is rather bare-bones, though the hip-looking people in their skinny-looking jeans and chunky-looking glasses tend to provide most of the visual stimulation.

But another group of the same size was seated first, even though they arrived after us, which was a little less nice.\n\nThe menu was extensive, and very vegetarian-friendly.  Pretty much anything can be made with tofu, and my friends ended up with piles of various vegetables on top of brown rice.  They looked (and, I'm told, were) super good.  We also got spring rolls and, perhaps to compensate for being so darn healthy, the corn cakes.  Not being one to pass up curry, I got the gang koor goong: shrimp in red curry, pineapples, tomatoes, and basil.  The spring rolls were deliciously average, the corn cake was deliciously fried (and a refreshing change of pace!), and the curry held its own quite well.  It was creamy with a little heat as I was anticipating, but I was a little disappointed by the amount of delightful chunky bits in my curry - it looked a bit more like soup, though it did taste excellent over the rice.\n\nThe service was really quite alright once we were seated, and I'm mostly content with the prices - Thai House Express could charge for ambiance if it wanted to, but they don't and I appreciate that very much.

Not the lame American taste bud brand of spicy, but the rest of the world brand that makes the flavors dance in your mouth.  I particularly enjoy the fresh spring rolls, larb gai, beef panang curry, pad thai, and the fried whole fish with sweet sauce on their specials menu.  The place can get busy during dinner, but they take to go orders.  Yes!  The service can also be slow at times, but just be aggressive when flagging down your server.  \n\nNote:  My bf recently told me that the food was shockingly bad during his visit last week.  Bad enough for him to wonder if they've gotten new chefs or are under new management.

In fact, I even referred to Jamie anonymously as \"my dining companion\" in that review, which shows you how long it's been. What may have caused the lengthy sabbatical was a piece of twine that he found in his dish. I was so nice back then that I still gave the proprietors four stars, even though I recounted the incident in painstaking detail. Nowadays I'm not so nice. I'm more interested in being fair which is why I felt a need to share our recent marginally disappointing experience.\n\nJamie was surprisingly the one who suggested our spontaneous return visit. Service felt rushed and indifferent the moment we arrived. We were seated near the window crowded between two tables for two, all four of whom were already quite settled into their meals. I tried to squeeze myself onto the banquette without incident, but it was a chore that only heightened the nervous energy of the server. Once settled in, we shared an appetizer, the $6.95 Corn Cakes which were OK but nothing more in flavor or texture with a dipping sauce of sorts made up of cucumber slices, ground peanuts and red onion (photo: http://bit.ly/1P1rMWf).\n\nWe then shared Jamie's favorite Thai dish, the $7.95 Pad Mee Kao (Drunken Noodles) with chicken, onions, carrots, chili, Chinese broccoli and basil, and I have to admit it was rather on the soupy side. No twine but no definable texture either, just a soppy affair that fell short of satisfying either of our palates (photo: http://bit.ly/1CA6b0E).

I fully expected to drive by and end up eating in the inner Richmond but there were actually a few open spots on Castro.  Sweet.  \n\nAmbiance:\nFor a rather inexpensive restaurant, the place was very nicely decorated to look hip but also somewhat cozy.  In addition to views of Castro Street, there were tasteful paintings on the wall and low lighting.  \n\nFood:\nPortion sizes were good.  Sticky rice came in large, exceptionally sticky quantities and as a harsh critic of sticky rice, I give this order a 4.5 out of 5 (5 is reserved for the sticky rice at SEA restaurant in Brooklyn, the sweetest and stickies of all).\nEverything was made veggie for us with none of the awkwardness that sometimes follows ordering a full veggie meal.  There was a corn fritter appetizer on the menu which was of large proportions and quite tasty.\nThe Tom Yum soup was good, not great.  About average and not spicy enough.  The Tofu and veggies were good and fresh, not too greasy, a definite plus.\n***READ IF YOU ARE VEGGIE*** The curries are made with fish sauce, even the ones listed on the Vegetarian section of the menu.  I don't know why they did this but I am glad I asked.\n\nPrice:\nAverage for Thai in a cool neighborhood.  The total bill for two entrees, an appetizer and two orders of sticky rice came out to about $25.00.  And we were very full.\n\nPeople:\nLots of nice looking guys in their mid-twenties to early thirties.  A crazy guy came in screaming and making a huge scene...entertainment, I guess.

But your food is lackluster and your service is downright dismal. Take for example last night when my friend and I came over to have a three-way with you. The front of the restaurant was already crowded and you refused to open up the back *ahem*. You sat us at a table for two right in front of the counter, in the thick of the dining orgy, than proceeded to treat us as if we were invisible for fifteen minutes. No water, no drink orders, not even a reach around. How rude!\n\nWhen one of your waiters finally came over he was surly-- like he was coming off a bender or had gotten a little too much abuse that evening. We ordered up Garden Rolls, Pad Thai, Basil Chicken and Sticky Rice. It surprised me that he could even take our order considering he barely listened to anything we said. \n\nWhen our Garden Rolls came to the table, they were carried by a different server-- this one completely listless.

So it took our listless server a good three minutes to get everything up off the floor-- with nary an apology mind you.\n\nImagine our surprise when a new platter came out only thirty-seconds after the broken platter had been taken away. This time it was placed three-quarters of the way on our table. I can't be sure if you just reused the same garden rolls that were on the floor but I have a suspicion you did. BTW- the rolls were so dry we choked, and we're gay so choking is something we rarely do.

After our first bite both my friend and I became diabetic. And the Basil Chicken-- EESHK! It was so salty even the other people in the restaurant who didn't eat it will be retaining water for the next month. I will admit that the Sticky Rice came out alright-- which surprised me since you seemed to eff everything else up.\n\nThai House Express on Castro-- we won't see each other any more.
