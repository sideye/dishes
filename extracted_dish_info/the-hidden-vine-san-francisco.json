Dark, lots of wood and exposed brick. Plenty of leather chairs and velvet sofas to sink into. The coveted seats are the ones right in front of the cast-iron fireplace.

Two of the wines were from Yarden, a winery that I just happened to visit while in the far north of Israel a couple years ago.  Ah, memories.  Couldn't have been a better birthday treat.\n\nThe food options are somewhat simple since they really focus on the wines here.
