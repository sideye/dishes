The bar itself has a cool rock-star feel to it as soon as you walk in. It's dark but the high ceilings, the nice ambience inside and the jazz music on the background is quite relaxing upon entrance. My go-to drink? \"South Side Cocktail\" - Gin, lemon, sugar, mint, seltzer. Simple, plain for some but oh - so - yum. I have only been here 2x but I always want to come back for more. My bf always orders the Scottish eggs. He enjoys them every time. We also had the meatballs. It was alright. We plan to come back this weekend so I am hoping to try their entrees. The Comstock Burger is trying to call my name. Ha. The other thing I enjoy here is the live Jazz band that plays upstairs on their 2nd floor. My bf's friend plays his saxophone there at times. The band plays incredible songs that make your entire experience quite fun and relaxed. I definitely recommend that you try this place. Cocktails range from $8 - $12. Trust me..
