The burrito was gargantuan, though, so I brought most of it home.\n\nThe only detractors are as follows.  There isn't enough salsa to go around, and according to another review, you have to pay for extra.  Also, it may be that I was unreasonably hungry, but I felt the 10+ minutes I waited for my burrito was a bit more than needed, even for fresh ingredients.

I even told him that it was my favorite taqueria and instead of eating near my school in Potrero Hill sometimes--there are porbably 20 taqueria between it and Papalote I truck there.  \n\nI was a regular customer--but that's what shitty customer service can do.

The only downsides are (1) the soyrizo is super salty and makes me really freakin thirsty (2) they charge $1 for extra chips (3) $.50 for extra salsa (4) the long lines (5) the front door doesn't close and its always freezing.

A friend from Phoenix had recommended that I swing by Papalote to get some assuredly delicious vegan mole.

In other words, the food was so good that I skipped out on seeing some places that I may not ever get a chance to see again.\n\nThe first time I went, I got a veggie potato burro thing with soyrizo.  This was amazing.  Period.  Super delicious.\n\nThe second time, I had the vegan mole burro with a side of guacamole.  The burro was great (I liked the veggie burro with soyrizo more though), but the guacamole was kind of lame.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but it didn't taste freshly prepared.\n\nSo, the food was delicious, but the store itself sucks.  It was packed out the door both times we went, preventing any possibility of actually sitting down to eat.  The first time we went, it was like 3pm on a Saturday, and the second time was abour 1pm on a Monday.  Weird times to be so completely busy.  It was really loud as well, and I could barely hear the server girl who was very frustrating to work with anyways.  She was just sort of rude, and kept turning around and joking with the grill guys while I was trying to order, then gave me attitude when I corrected her inaccurate record of my order.  I don't know, it just added stress to something that should be delicious and stress free (mexican food).  Oh, also, the bathroom is sort of gross, and they keep all of their produce in the common area where a thousand dirty hipsters assuredly wipe their gross hands all over my delicious cucumbers and tomatoes.  It HAS to be against some sort of health code to store produce in the area where people stand in line to order.  Right?  \n\nSo, four stars because the food was excellent.

We get there and, though the wait was somewhat long, the staff was so friendly and attentive that it wasn't a bother at all. \n\nI ordered the soyrizo burrito (not particularly adventurous, but it's what I was in the mood for). It was just okay, not any better or worse than what I might make at home using store-bought soyrizo. I wasn't unhappy with my meal, but I wasn't impressed. I'd rate it 3 stars on its own. \n\nMy girlfriend's burrito was a different story. She orded the lime-seasoned prawn burrito, but the seasoning was so bland that she actually thought they'd given her the wrong burrito! I asked the (very polite and attentive) waitress if perhaps they'd prepared her the shrimp burrito with the butter-wine sauce by mistake, but it turns out it was the right burrito, just not a very good one.*\n\nThe other problem, besides flavor, was the number of prawns. This was an $11 burrito that had 4 smallish prawns in it. I don't expect it to be loaded up like a shrimp burrito, but I eat a lot of Mexican food and I know what $11 should buy me. I am not a diner with a sense of entitlement, I just don't want to feel ripped off. 4 tiny prawns just isn't gonna cut it in a huge burrito. It was basically a beans, rice and cheese burrito w/ a cameo appearance by some prawns.\n\nThe biggest surprise though, was the salsa. Papalote is renowned for their salsa. So I found it surprising that a Mexican place famous for its salsa DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY SALSA WITH YOUR FOOD.... YOU HAVE TO BUY IT. **\n\nI am, as my obnoxious use of capital letters might indicate, dead serious: Salsa with your chips is free, but you have to pay to have salsa with your food. \n\nYou get a small (maybe 2 oz) cup of salsa with your chips. The place is popular, so you wait with that basket of chips for quite a while before your food comes. When your food arrives, it does not come with salsa. As it turns out, if you want salsa with your food you have two choices:\n\n(1) Eat your chips without salsa, so you can save the salsa for your food. C'mon son. This might not be objectively unreasonable, but it's unreasonable in light of custom: what Mexican restaurant expects you to eat chips without salsa?\n\n(2) Purchase more salsa to go with your food, at the rate of $0.50 per small cup.\n\nAdmittedly, $0.50 is not a big deal, but the idea that the only way to enjoy salsa with your food at this Mexican restaurant is to either pay extra or eat your chips without salsa just reeks of, dare I say it, arrogance. It's like they're so gassed up over people telling them how dope their salsa is that they think they're doing us a favor by letting us eat there. \n\nI get it. You're world-famous for your salsa. You sell the salsa separately in a jar. People would probably consume insane amounts of the salsa if you didn't regulate it somehow.... but is it going to kill you to give me one cup of salsa with my chips and one cup of salsa with my food? I mean, seriously, that just comes off as really, really cheap. I purchase a $30 fast-Mexican meal for two and have to pay extra to get the salsa? How is that cost not built into my $10 burrito?? \n\nThis is the kind of disregard for customer perspective that causes once-great businesses to fail. Not saying I see Papalote failing anytime soon, but it was a *huge* turnoff for me and I probably won't eat there again because of that last straw. Two people can eat at Rubio's (which actually has very good food for fast-Mexican), spend $20 and enjoy several cups of their delicious salsas or free! The mind boggles.\n\nAlso, the salsa is tasty, but not something I would have thought to rave about if Papalote wasn't already well-hyped for its salsa. Despite really wanting to love my dining experience at Papalote, I walked away not understanding what the fuss is about. So disappointed.\n\n______________\n\n* I love my girlfriend, but I'm not the type to give a place a shitty review just because she had a bad experience (see my review of Sushi Raw if you have any doubts). That being said, her burrito was so skimpy on prawns that I was disappointed just *watching* her eat it. It was like watching someone pick the wrong door on a game show over and over again: bite after bite with not a prawn in sight.\n\n** I KNOW!!", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["and I love their soyrizo!

I was mildly surprised by the interesting 'Mexicant' menu, including healthy options like soyrizo and vegan mole. I was even more surprised after having a burrito there, that I not only liked it...I loved it.\n\nMyself, being a carnivore, love all of the meaty servings that they have to offer.  I personally love their Carne Asada and Chile Verde Burritos.  They are very flavorful, and not heavy at all: A combination in a burrito that you would think would cause a paradox that would unravel space-time.  However, it all works to me, and it doesn't feel I ate a truck when I leave.  Also, their Salsa is deserving of all the accolodates that it receives.\n\nDelicious and health-conscious food, reminds me of what I miss about the city the most.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-01-22"}, {"excerpts": ["Now I just need to try some of their veggie/vegan options like tofu tacos or a soyrizo burrito (how awesome is it that they offer these things!?).

Very good, I give it 4 out of 5. Nice big corn tortillas filled to the gills with good stuff. Same goes for the Marinated Tofu Tacos....... Absolutely awesome! One of the best tasting achiote paste/sauces I've had in a long time. The Tofu was grilled then sauted with the achiote paste. Excellent blend! I'd go back just for this dish. Tofu gets my best rating of 5 out of 5. These guys set the bar on tofu. Tacos Mole with Chicken.....You can tell they didn't use the achiote paste here, the mole they used was in need of (never thought I'd say this) salt. The chicken was dry and not simmered in the mole to make it moist and yummy. I gave them 2 out of 5. Soyrizo tacos....were pretty good. They tasted like store bought Soyrizo with crispy chopped Romaine, tomato salsa with light onion and cilantro. Actually all the tacos had the same garnishes. I gave them 4 out of 5.

Is the salsa delicious? Absolutely. That's about all I can say.\n\nMy gripes:\n1) You can't \"mix and match\" your tacos - meaning, if you want to try two kinds of meat, you have to end up with 4 tacos. See, typically I go to taquerias and get 2 or 3 tacos, each with a different protein so I can sample. Much to my dismay, when I asked about this the nice lady said I have to get the 2 tacos.  That's kind of crappy.\n\n2) The chile verde was pretty bad.  Despite having some heat, it was otherwise bland from the flavor side.  The pork was fake-tender. By that I mean, you could break of pieces easiily with a fork, but it was still dry. Clearly it had been simmering for too long in too high of heat. Even I, the home cook, know this - poor technique in the kitchen.  The scary part? I asked the cashier if she recommended the chile verde or the chicken mole, and she said chile verde. I'm terrified of how crappy the mole might be.\n\n3) The tacos come covered in lettuce and tomatoes. What?  Why? There's so much of it too. I appreciate wanting to promote eating veggies and all, but I came here to eat a taco - with meat.  Not ok.\n\n4) Guacamole - was also bland. I had to add some salt. There was no limey zip, and I'm not even sure how but I didn't really get the flavor of avocado. \n\n5) Service - When the gentleman brought out my tacos, I asked about my side of guac. He looked at the ticket in his hand, which I also saw, and it clear said \"Chile Verde, Guacamole.\" He seemed very confused. My friend also pointed out that on her (separate) order, she had asked and paid for 2 extra salsas and those were not brought out either. He seemed confused and flustered. Eventually we got everything we needed but it wasn't like he was bringing out multiple plates of food at once. He literally was only carrying my tacos in one hand and the ticket that clearly stated \"Guacamole\" in the other.  Also, on an unrelated note - flies in the air. Not ideal.\n\nThis place is probably great for vegetarians/vegans who otherwise can't get Mexican food, but for us meat eaters, don't bother.  \n\n2 stars for the salsa.

They take card.  Woot! For a moment, after I stepped in, I panicked because I thought I wouldn't be able to get a burrito since I hardly ever carry around cash.  But phew!  They do!  And then I said to myself, \"Oh silly, of COURSE they take card!  Gringo burrito place, duh!\"  \n\n2. I got a chicken mole super burrito for $7.93.  The mole was pretty good, as was all the other fillings:\n+ Cheese = MELTED, I approve.\n+ Black Beans = Soft and flavorful, good job there!\n+ Chicken = Shredded and tender perfect chompos for me to eats!  \n+ Guac = Mush! Texture, flavor, aesthetically pleasing.  Who doesn't like avocados?\n+ Rice = Soft, just right. \n\n3.  Good location, close to the 24th/Mission BART.  Even though I work in the FiDi, I can easily BART here and back during a lunch break and still have time to spare.  \n\n4.  Hipster paradise indeed.  There were two very nice girls in front of me, with cute bags and flowy skirts and interesting hair.  Such a nice, appropriate place for the hipsters, hippies, and happy white people.  \n\n5.  So, I tried their chips and salsa finally.  It's on that 7x7 \"100 Things to Eat in SF\" list.  There must be something wrong with my taste buds.  The chips were not that great, nothing special.  You want awesome chips?  Tropisueno's got awesome chips!  The salsa, however, was bangin'.  Unfortunately, I can't take the heat, and one tiny taste set my entire mouth on fire.  It was good, yes, but painful.  \n\nSo, why the 3.5 stars?  This review seems to suggest a solid 4, maybe more, right?  Well, I mean, I definitely LIKED my burrito, but it was just...not totally 100% there. . .  \n\nYou know what I mean?  Imagine meeting a person, or attending a class, and even though he/she/it is perfectly fine and nice and all, you're just not blown away.  \n\nAnd you could go either way, go with it, or not.

The chicken was even more fall apart tender than the traditional Mexican options.  The adobo flavor was thankfully high on the garlic, soy and pepper while not getting overly vinegary.  No beans because that would have been weird.  The garlic rice was a nice touch to add an extra bit of zing.  What a great, portable way to enjoy Filipino food!

I didn't see the show and don't go there because of it.\n\nI've been eating at Papalote for the past 1.5 years and eat there at least once every other week. \n\nPros: \n\n1) The most amazing chicken mole burrito. (If you prefer you can get tofu mole instead.) I always get Super Chicken Mole burrito with black beans. It is my Go-To favorite burrito in the entire bay area. To me, this burrito is addictive as crack. I drive from Burlingame to San Francisco sometimes just to eat this burrito.\n\n2) The orange salsa that comes with your chips. They are pretty famous for this salsa. It's pretty hot but not enough to be super uncomfortable. It almost tastes creamy but there are no dairy products in it. Just pumpkin seeds or something like that.\n\n3) Well located, just a 2 block walk west on 24th Street from the 24th Street Bart, right across the street from the gas station at Valencia and 24th Street. Hard to miss since I think it is currently painted orange.\n\nCons: \n\n1) Really small and waits of around 30 minutes during busy times until you actually are eating your food. Hard to get a table. Best thing to do is order on the phone about 20 minutes ahead of time and then go 'cut' in line by picking up your food at the right-most register. It's so satisfying to pseudo cut in line and get your food to go.\n\n2) Crowd seems a little too trendy for my tastes. \n\n3) Price is a little high for a burrito, but you get what you pay for. After tax, I think it ends up being around 9 bucks for a Super Mole Chicken Burrito.\n\n4) AFAIK, no delivery, which would be awesome.", "rating": 5, "date": "2010-03-02"}, {"excerpts": ["My friend got the mole chicken quesadilla which was super delicious.

It's still spicy, but I've learned to better ignore my screaming pain receptors. There's something about eating crunchy tortilla chips with a creamy sauce that makes everything taste way better. I love this combination so much that I always save my leftover chips and sauce for future snacking. I even save my friends' leftover chips and sauce.

And when my friends and I are feeling like lazy bums...sorry, since we ARE lazy bums, we call in bulk to-go orders, wait 15 minutes, and send over volunteer tributes to pick up our stash.\n\n2) Quality. Their meat is GOOD. Tender. Moist. And they are so generous. One of my girls swears by two menu items: the mole and the chile verde. I've tried both, and I'm a much bigger fan of the CHILE VERDE because the pork makes my taste buds dance a happy dance. I get it as a salad to cut down on carbs and because the jicama and fresh salsa pair so well with the salty pork and the awesome green serrano sauce, which I drizzle errywhere. I've also tried their carne asada burrito and breakfast burrito, both of which are bomb. Oh, when they say scrambled eggs, they really mean pulverized eggs--it's pretty awesome.\n\n3) Customizable. Tacos, burritos, naked burritos, quesadillas, salads--meat/tofu vehicles of all types. Last I checked, their \"make it super\" option, which adds sour cream, cheese, and guacamole was only $1. Seems like the prices now are more expensive per online source?\n\n4) Crack sauce. When I first tried it, I wasn't a big fan because it's spicy. It's still spicy, but I've learned to better ignore my screaming pain receptors. There's something about eating crunchy tortilla chips with a creamy sauce that makes everything taste way better. I love this combination so much that I always save my leftover chips and sauce for future snacking. I even save my friends' leftover chips and sauce. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy, squirreling away all of those mini sauce containers in our fridge. I think I'm GENIUS. They sell jars of this stuff, and I'm getting it FO' FREE.\n\n5) REWARDS CARD. This perk deserves to be repeated. FYI: valid for burrito purchases only.\n\nDownside: seating. It looks like a seat-yourself situation, but one of the waitstaff will usually be around the dining room entrance to keep an eye out for tables.

The roasted tomatoes and chili provide a bit of a smokey flavor, the salsa is a full-bodied/robust work of art boasting in both flavor and aroma.

If you responded \"Papalote\" ... ding ding ding!\n\nSeriously, as much as I like El Farolito (of which I am also a fan), Papalote will likely be in the mix for my go to spots for Mexican fare, even though I have mixed feelings.  As far as authenticity and value, Papalote is lacking, so I can see where others are coming from when they reduce Papalote as merely a fancy Chipotle, though I don't agree.  Also, Papalote's burritos are slightly smaller and pricier than its Mission counterparts.  \n\nOn the other hand.  It's hard to argue with the quality, especially the famed roasted tomato salsa. \n\nOverrated?  Nope, I don't think so.  Papalote's burrito and quesadilla were simply delicious, no exaggerated flavors.  In my view, Papalote deserves all the pub that comes with being named as SF Weekly's \"best burrito\" every year since 2007.  Now the Food Network has taken notice.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was off the chain, with tender beef and rich flavor and the burrito was not overly salted.  Plus it was just the right size that it wont leave you stuffed and bloated after the meal.\n\nHowever, the highlight of my meal was the camarones quesadilla, which features shrimp sauteed in white wine and butter with delicious melted cheese...seriously, this is very very good stuff.  Add to that the flavor of the roasted peppers, with a dab of roasted tomato salsa and a bottle of coke on the side...I'd say that's a winning combo.\n\nUnfortunately, the only damper was that the chips we got were too hard and they might have been a little stale.  It didn't matter too much in the end.  The roasted tomato salsa was so good that I could have dipped cardboard in it and I would have enjoyed the meal.\n\nThank you; Chef Escobedo.

The burrito is pretty large in size. it has carne asada, chicken, prawns, Mexican rice, and of course sour cream and guacamole. To be real I don't even know if I went to the one from the show but cuuuh so dank. if you're in SF or just a tourist, I would definitely recommend coming here. Sure $19.99 is pretty pricy for food and it's probably a lot cheaper if you make it yourself but for the experience it's well worth it. With that being said, I'm sure their other burritos are pretty dank as well I think you could custom make your burritos too. Also their sauce is pretty dank too like it's not too spicy but not too mild.

Erm, must be the alkie? :X  \n\nIt's 1 AM on Thursday Morning and while I should be \"attempting\" to sleep, my eyes are glued to  an episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\". For 26 minutes, my mouth was salivating at the thought of meeting the \"Triple Threat\" one day; needless to say, it was another sleepless night. *sigh*\n\nMy friends and I came here yesterday at 12ish and luckily, we came at just the right time before it started getting busy.\n\nFOOD:\n*Chips & Salsa (#46 on the 7x7 list): The chips were slightly warm, thin, and crisp with just the right amount of salt. Ahhhhh, the salsa....the BEST freaking salsa EVER! The salsa was emulsified to perfect creamy consistency. As it hits your palette and moves around your mouth, you can taste all the fresh ingredients (the charred tomatoes, garlic, onion, chilies, and cilantro) sink into your taste buds. It had the perfect blend of savory, smokiness, acidity, and fiery kick to it! This is the ONLY thing that lives up to the HYPE!\n\n*Triple Threat (super w/ sour cream & guac): HOLY MOLEY! $20 for a freaking burrito?!?!? The burrito was a regular size burrito that you would find from any taqueria. It was generously filled with rice, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. The rice was al-dente and the chicken breast, carne asada, and shrimp were perfectly grilled, well-seasoned, and tender. The sour cream and guac are a must as it added a slight tartness and creaminess to balance out all the flavors.\n\n*Ode to Poleng Adobe Burrito: FAIL! If you're expecting the garlicy, peppery soysauce vinegary taste that makes your lips pucker type of Adobo, you will be sadly disappointed. The chicken lacked all the components of what an adobo should be and was not well-seasoned. Errr, where was the garlic friend rice? The rice used was the standard burrito rice. The tortilla was the only thing that stood out. It was different from the typical tortilla used; it was crisp and flaky. All in all, the burrito lacked any real flavor and was quite dry b/c there was no sauce or salsa in it).\n\nDRINKS:\nPapalote has a selection of sodas, juices, and Mexican beer. I have to note that their refrigeration system was not working properly yesterday as our drinks were room temperature.\n\nPRICES:\nWAY OVERPRICED! A regular burrito is about $8 and an extra $1 to make it super (sour cream and guac). The size of their regular burritos are quite small (approx 7' and 2.5' in diameter) compared to other taquerias in The Mission.\n\nAlthough the Triple Threat was good; it was NO where near a $20 good! To me, Mexican food is just like Chinese food; you shouldn't have to pay much to get good-tasting food. And, I really think the \"hype\" has allowed Papalote to capitalize on its customers by charging such ludicrous prices. \n\nSERVICE:\nOrder your food at the counter, grab a number, and the server will being you your order when it's ready. The chips and salsa came first and it took about 15 minutes to get our burritos.    \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery funky hipster type feel with the bright red walls with colorful panting and reggae music playing in the background. \n\nPARKING: \nDifficult street parking around Valencia and Mission streets. However, Guerrero street seemed to have some available non-metered spots. \n\nWould I return? I would only return for the chips and salsa. Other than that, Papalote is WAY OVERYHYPED and OVERPRICED. I say bottle the salsa and bring it with you to the other taquerias like Pancho Villa or El Toro where you can get a freshly grilled steak and shrimp burrito for 2/3 of the price.", "rating": 3, "date": "2010-03-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Carne asada fajitas - huge portion, and came with lots of veggies including eggplant.

I tried a piece of the soyrizo quesadilla, and was very pleasantly surprised.  It was well seasoned, and the texture was not weird.  I think this dish will be my go-to from now on!\n\nOTHER DISHES I'VE TRIED:\n1. Chips and salsa - this is on the 7x7 100 things to try list.

Prices are a bit higher than what you'd expect to find at other Mexican places in the Mission - the steak fajitas were $13.95!

Sure it's expensive, but it's way better than Frontera or any of that other hoity-toity stuff that tries to pass for gourmet salsa. Based on the quality of their salsa, I was very excited to try the Papalote restaurant in the Mission today!\n\nPapalote is a small restaurant on a largely residential block of 24th street. It's conveniently located a couple of blocks from the 24th & Mission BART stop and also a block away from a good friend's house. If I'd known it was this close, I would have gone numerous times already! Inside the restaurant are a handful of tables next to a large window which offers a good people watching view of the street outside. You order at the counter up front and then take a number and sit down.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and rice. The burrito was about average in size, but that's ok because I don't like overeating these days. The contents were very tasty with plenty of grilled beef and flavorful rice and beans. I only had one funny bit of gristle in the burrito, so I would call that a rousing success for the Bay Area. They also give you tasty chips and a cup of their salsa before the meal. HOWEVER, if you want more salsa to go with your meal, it costs an additional fifty cents for each refill. WTF?! Most places load you up on salsa without an additional charge. This is something they really should consider since it seems a little chintzy of them.\n\nMy two lunch friends had the pork chile verde tacos and the fish burrito. The tacos looked good, but seemed to be piled high with garnish which seemed a little weird. If I order the tacos in future, I'll get them with just meat and tortilla. The fish burrito looked like a winner and my friend swears by it, so I'm either getting that next time or trying the machaca which is hard to find in the Bay Area!\n\nPapalote is a very clean, stylish restaurant.

I was surprised when they came out and there was only one tortilla underneath.  It was difficult to eat as a taco since they were loaded up with vegetables and tofu.   Overall they were good but the tofu was a bit odd (I've never had grilled tofu before).

EXCEPT, the salsa is super good. I feel the urge to repeat that last sentence. I live really close to Papalote and, on the day I moved in, two separate friends brought up the Mexican restaurant near by with the awesome salsa. The shrimp tacos were nice. The shrimp grilled in white wine and garlic. They are plated on a couple of open soft tacos with crunchy lettuce and pico de gallo, and taste very fresh.

It looked so tasty that I got it the next day before yoga class (slightly bad idea)... yes, it is on the pricier side and added up to $13 but it is a meal for 3 days. I had it for lunch yesterday, and then lunch today... and I still have a good amount of rice and beans left that I can pair with other protein for dinner tonight. \n\nPapalote was also featured on Bobby Flay's show, which is pretty cool.

", "The single meat burritos are about $10, which is a little pricey. "], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "About six years ago, Flay challenged Papalote to a burrito contest and the triple threat burrito triumphed. I wish I knew what Papalote was like before it was featured on Throwdown. Was the triple threat always $20? Back then, $20 was a lot of cash for a burrito and it still is now, but at least that burrito hasn't been affected by inflation in these past few years. Also, the hype has calmed down compared to those crowds after the episode first aired. \n\nTriple Threat - chicken breast, carne asada, prawns:\nIt's loaded with 3 types of proteins, but I don't feel threatened. The taste and quality is on par with most burritos, so in comparison, the price tag sure is steep. The grilled prawns were the best part. They're tender and springy with a nice char. Plus, the prawns are left whole instead of chopped up beyond recognition. The chicken and carne asada are nicely seasoned, too. \nIt is a very large burrito, so if you need a reason to justify spending $20, you can share it or split it between two meals. It's also a good decision if you have a tough time choosing between poultry, beef, & seafood, or if you're just curious to try it, but it is not a must have.\n\nThe Carne Asada & Pollo Asado burritos are pretty good too, sans shrimp. The single meat burritos are about $10, which is a little pricey. Adding cheese, guac, or sour cream are each $1. Kind of a bummer, since burritos usually include cheese. If you're going to add one, you might as well add all 3 for $2, resulting in a very creamy burrito. \n\nOf course the roasted tomato salsa is excellent. It is the true threat here. This thick & creamy, robust, orange sauce is like a flavor explosion of smokey, sweet, savory, spicy, and slightly tart. This salsa is excellent on their thin, warm chips, as well as on everything else. Jars of Papalote's various salsas are available for purchase in various local markets. \nOverall, I'm satisfied with the food, but the prices are high relative to other Mexican joints in the Mission, so I give it a 7.25/10.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-07-07"}, {"excerpts": ["My pollo asado burrito was too soggy for my preference and also just lacked flavor.

I just cannot understand the hype around this place. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd come back here- it's just not a good value.\n\nI've tried Papalote's food before. I have vague memories of eating there before I lived in SF and I'd had their takeout at a friend's house before. I don't remember being blown away by it, but I don't remember hating it either. Then again, I'm from Socal, so Mexican food is one category in which SF tends to let me down.\n\nFast forward to last night. We get there and, though the wait was somewhat long, the staff was so friendly and attentive that it wasn't a bother at all. \n\nI ordered the soyrizo burrito (not particularly adventurous, but it's what I was in the mood for). It was just okay, not any better or worse than what I might make at home using store-bought soyrizo. I wasn't unhappy with my meal, but I wasn't impressed. I'd rate it 3 stars on its own. \n\nMy girlfriend's burrito was a different story. She orded the lime-seasoned prawn burrito, but the seasoning was so bland that she actually thought they'd given her the wrong burrito! I asked the (very polite and attentive) waitress if perhaps they'd prepared her the shrimp burrito with the butter-wine sauce by mistake, but it turns out it was the right burrito, just not a very good one.*\n\nThe other problem, besides flavor, was the number of prawns. This was an $11 burrito that had 4 smallish prawns in it. I don't expect it to be loaded up like a shrimp burrito, but I eat a lot of Mexican food and I know what $11 should buy me. I am not a diner with a sense of entitlement, I just don't want to feel ripped off. 4 tiny prawns just isn't gonna cut it in a huge burrito. It was basically a beans, rice and cheese burrito w/ a cameo appearance by some prawns.\n\nThe biggest surprise though, was the salsa. Papalote is renowned for their salsa. So I found it surprising that a Mexican place famous for its salsa DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY SALSA WITH YOUR FOOD.... YOU HAVE TO BUY IT. **\n\nI am, as my obnoxious use of capital letters might indicate, dead serious: Salsa with your chips is free, but you have to pay to have salsa with your food. \n\nYou get a small (maybe 2 oz) cup of salsa with your chips. The place is popular, so you wait with that basket of chips for quite a while before your food comes. When your food arrives, it does not come with salsa. As it turns out, if you want salsa with your food you have two choices:\n\n(1) Eat your chips without salsa, so you can save the salsa for your food. C'mon son. This might not be objectively unreasonable, but it's unreasonable in light of custom: what Mexican restaurant expects you to eat chips without salsa?\n\n(2) Purchase more salsa to go with your food, at the rate of $0.50 per small cup.\n\nAdmittedly, $0.50 is not a big deal, but the idea that the only way to enjoy salsa with your food at this Mexican restaurant is to either pay extra or eat your chips without salsa just reeks of, dare I say it, arrogance. It's like they're so gassed up over people telling them how dope their salsa is that they think they're doing us a favor by letting us eat there. \n\nI get it. You're world-famous for your salsa. You sell the salsa separately in a jar. People would probably consume insane amounts of the salsa if you didn't regulate it somehow.... but is it going to kill you to give me one cup of salsa with my chips and one cup of salsa with my food? I mean, seriously, that just comes off as really, really cheap. I purchase a $30 fast-Mexican meal for two and have to pay extra to get the salsa? How is that cost not built into my $10 burrito?? \n\nThis is the kind of disregard for customer perspective that causes once-great businesses to fail. Not saying I see Papalote failing anytime soon, but it was a *huge* turnoff for me and I probably won't eat there again because of that last straw. Two people can eat at Rubio's (which actually has very good food for fast-Mexican), spend $20 and enjoy several cups of their delicious salsas or free! The mind boggles.\n\nAlso, the salsa is tasty, but not something I would have thought to rave about if Papalote wasn't already well-hyped for its salsa. Despite really wanting to love my dining experience at Papalote, I walked away not understanding what the fuss is about. So disappointed.\n\n______________\n\n* I love my girlfriend, but I'm not the type to give a place a shitty review just because she had a bad experience (see my review of Sushi Raw if you have any doubts). That being said, her burrito was so skimpy on prawns that I was disappointed just *watching* her eat it.

"], "author": "Joy W.", "review": "About six years ago, Flay challenged Papalote to a burrito contest and the triple threat burrito triumphed. I wish I knew what Papalote was like before it was featured on Throwdown. Was the triple threat always $20? Back then, $20 was a lot of cash for a burrito and it still is now, but at least that burrito hasn't been affected by inflation in these past few years. Also, the hype has calmed down compared to those crowds after the episode first aired. \n\nTriple Threat - chicken breast, carne asada, prawns:\nIt's loaded with 3 types of proteins, but I don't feel threatened. The taste and quality is on par with most burritos, so in comparison, the price tag sure is steep. The grilled prawns were the best part. They're tender and springy with a nice char. Plus, the prawns are left whole instead of chopped up beyond recognition. The chicken and carne asada are nicely seasoned, too. \nIt is a very large burrito, so if you need a reason to justify spending $20, you can share it or split it between two meals. It's also a good decision if you have a tough time choosing between poultry, beef, & seafood, or if you're just curious to try it, but it is not a must have.\n\nThe Carne Asada & Pollo Asado burritos are pretty good too, sans shrimp. The single meat burritos are about $10, which is a little pricey. Adding cheese, guac, or sour cream are each $1. Kind of a bummer, since burritos usually include cheese. If you're going to add one, you might as well add all 3 for $2, resulting in a very creamy burrito. \n\nOf course the roasted tomato salsa is excellent. It is the true threat here. This thick & creamy, robust, orange sauce is like a flavor explosion of smokey, sweet, savory, spicy, and slightly tart. This salsa is excellent on their thin, warm chips, as well as on everything else. Jars of Papalote's various salsas are available for purchase in various local markets. \nOverall, I'm satisfied with the food, but the prices are high relative to other Mexican joints in the Mission, so I give it a 7.25/10.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-07-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Last I checked, their \"make it super\" option, which adds sour cream, cheese, and guacamole was only $1.

I could have gotten so many free burritos by now!\n\nAside from free burritos, what makes this place great?\n\n1) Convenient. I live a block from this location. And when my friends and I are feeling like lazy bums...sorry, since we ARE lazy bums, we call in bulk to-go orders, wait 15 minutes, and send over volunteer tributes to pick up our stash.\n\n2) Quality. Their meat is GOOD. Tender. Moist. And they are so generous. One of my girls swears by two menu items: the mole and the chile verde. I've tried both, and I'm a much bigger fan of the CHILE VERDE because the pork makes my taste buds dance a happy dance. I get it as a salad to cut down on carbs and because the jicama and fresh salsa pair so well with the salty pork and the awesome green serrano sauce, which I drizzle errywhere. I've also tried their carne asada burrito and breakfast burrito, both of which are bomb. Oh, when they say scrambled eggs, they really mean pulverized eggs--it's pretty awesome.\n\n3) Customizable. Tacos, burritos, naked burritos, quesadillas, salads--meat/tofu vehicles of all types. Last I checked, their \"make it super\" option, which adds sour cream, cheese, and guacamole was only $1. Seems like the prices now are more expensive per online source?\n\n4) Crack sauce. When I first tried it, I wasn't a big fan because it's spicy. It's still spicy, but I've learned to better ignore my screaming pain receptors. There's something about eating crunchy tortilla chips with a creamy sauce that makes everything taste way better. I love this combination so much that I always save my leftover chips and sauce for future snacking. I even save my friends' leftover chips and sauce. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy, squirreling away all of those mini sauce containers in our fridge. I think I'm GENIUS. They sell jars of this stuff, and I'm getting it FO' FREE.\n\n5) REWARDS CARD. This perk deserves to be repeated. FYI: valid for burrito purchases only.\n\nDownside: seating. It looks like a seat-yourself situation, but one of the waitstaff will usually be around the dining room entrance to keep an eye out for tables. The room holds about 20 people, so you might have to wait for a bit during rush hours.\n\nBut srsly, Papalote is dope-alote.

It has a cool, vibe to it- fits right in in the Mission neighborhood.\n\nYou order at the front counter and then are asked to wait outside until they are able to seat your party. \n\nObviously I ordered the $19.95 Triple Threat Burrito (Don't worry- I shared this with one other person) as that's the very burrito that beat out Bobby Flay and was mentioned in the article... P.s. It's an extra $0.99 for guacamole ... Why wouldn't a $20 burrito already have guacamole in it?

So the burrito was really good... Really, really good... Probably the best meat I've ever had in a burrito- the pieces of steak and chicken are lean and big and juicy and flavorful; very different from many Mexican food places where the meat is always greasy, minced to an oblivion and full of weird, chewy and fatty bites where you aren't quite sure what you just put in your mouth (icky)... The shrimp is grilled to perfection and also bursting with flavor... All the meats are cooked to order and you really could taste the freshness in the cooking- it keeps you excited for each and every bite that you take.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal... The high quality of the meat is definitely the highlight of this place.... But to me, they really need to improve their chip recipe and the fact that this place isn't what you would consider to be typical \"Mexican taqueria style\" food threw me off a little from what I was expecting... Also, in my opinion, America's best burrito is definitely not going to have black beans inside it. \n\nOkay, so maybe it's not the best burrito in my book, but I would say this place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area. \n\nNote: This place has tons of vegetarian options which was really cool to me.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["I ordered nachos - mushy black beans in gravy, and lots of cheese.

The three of us all being foodies - talk of food was inevitable as dinner time approached us.\n\nJB mentioned a burrito place that had recently been featured on \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\".  Now, I like Bobby as a person more than a chef, and I do enjoy this show from time to time but I had missed this episode.  But my interest was piqued in learning that Bobby had lost to the \"triple threat burrito\" at Papalote, so we started walking to check the place out for dinner.\n\nWell, as we expected, there was a massive line of people wanting to try the place that had beaten the Iron Chef.  As it turned out, there were more people waiting for their placed order than wanting to order, so we were able to squeeze right through to the counter.\n\nAll three of us wanted the Triple Threat.  \nAll three of us gawked at the price: $20.\n\nTWENTY DOLLARS?\nThe first natural question was: how big is it?\nAnswer:  same size as the other burritos... that average out at about $7.50 in cost.\n\n*(looking around the room to make sure I'm on earth)*\n\nON WHAT PLANET DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?????????\n\nSame size - 1/3 portion of beef, chicken and shrimp....\nAlmost 3X in cost.\n\nFOR WHAT?\n\nForget that!  Do I have \"IDIOT\" written on my forehead?\n\nWe scored seating in the restaurant within 10 minutes, and that was good since our wait for the regular burritos would be over 30 minutes.\n\nOnce seated, we just paid $30 for a plate of fish tacos and a beef/chicken burrito, with a beer and a diet coke.  Examining the receipt, it became clear that we had been charged for fish tacos, a beef burrito AND a chicken burrito.\n\n(Annoying.)\n\nThe chips were decent, and their \"special secret sauce\" (salsa) was pretty good in concept but overly salted, and not quite what *I* want from \"salsa\".  Nonetheless, it was tasty.\n\nThe burritos arrive.\nRegular size.\nI was SO not a fan of the Monterey Jack cheese - in cold state, not melted - that they sprinkle on everything.  Yuck.  Took a bite of the chicken/beef burrito - and the only noteworthy thing was the chicken was well marinaded/seasoned.  The rest?  Unimpressive.  Overall, for the burrito, I'd have given it three stars.\n\nI tried the fish taco - and the fish was fresh and not deep-fried, the lettuce was crisp - but the cheese, as much as I tried to take it all off, ruined it for me.  If I had asked for no cheese - I would have given it three stars too.\n\nThere's a MUCH better burrito to be had at El Metate for a fraction of the cost and even better ambiance with better drinks and service, too.  ($5 for a burrito there - try it!)\n\nThe experience of eating at Papalote, due to the hype, was worth it.  The company made the whole night fun.  Perhaps, if we had been insane enough to splurge $20 to eat a burrito - my assessment would be higher.  But for a $20 burrito, I expect it to give me wings, and based on other reviews - nobody sprouted wings and took off.  It's unfortunate for the owners as they'd be making a WHOLE lot more money off the recent coverage if they charged $10 for the Triple Threat instead of attempting to price gouge their customers for $20.  Whatever number of Triple Threats they are selling right now for $20, they could sell 10X that amount had they charged $10.  Do the math.\n\nCoincidentally - upon arriving home later in the evening, the very episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\" came on TV and I watched it with the remnants of Papalote's burrito and fish taco in my stomach.\n\nBobby was as cute as ever, and based on ingredients alone, I'd have preferred his \"green burrito\".

This place is the real deal.\n\nIf this is your first time there, on each table there is a bottle of salsa picante (the red) and salsa verde (the green). OMG.

I just cannot understand the hype around this place. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd come back here- it's just not a good value.\n\nI've tried Papalote's food before. I have vague memories of eating there before I lived in SF and I'd had their takeout at a friend's house before. I don't remember being blown away by it, but I don't remember hating it either. Then again, I'm from Socal, so Mexican food is one category in which SF tends to let me down.\n\nFast forward to last night. We get there and, though the wait was somewhat long, the staff was so friendly and attentive that it wasn't a bother at all. \n\nI ordered the soyrizo burrito (not particularly adventurous, but it's what I was in the mood for). It was just okay, not any better or worse than what I might make at home using store-bought soyrizo. I wasn't unhappy with my meal, but I wasn't impressed. I'd rate it 3 stars on its own. \n\nMy girlfriend's burrito was a different story. She orded the lime-seasoned prawn burrito, but the seasoning was so bland that she actually thought they'd given her the wrong burrito! I asked the (very polite and attentive) waitress if perhaps they'd prepared her the shrimp burrito with the butter-wine sauce by mistake, but it turns out it was the right burrito, just not a very good one.*\n\nThe other problem, besides flavor, was the number of prawns. This was an $11 burrito that had 4 smallish prawns in it. I don't expect it to be loaded up like a shrimp burrito, but I eat a lot of Mexican food and I know what $11 should buy me. I am not a diner with a sense of entitlement, I just don't want to feel ripped off. 4 tiny prawns just isn't gonna cut it in a huge burrito. It was basically a beans, rice and cheese burrito w/ a cameo appearance by some prawns.\n\nThe biggest surprise though, was the salsa. Papalote is renowned for their salsa. So I found it surprising that a Mexican place famous for its salsa DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY SALSA WITH YOUR FOOD.... YOU HAVE TO BUY IT. **\n\nI am, as my obnoxious use of capital letters might indicate, dead serious: Salsa with your chips is free, but you have to pay to have salsa with your food. \n\nYou get a small (maybe 2 oz) cup of salsa with your chips. The place is popular, so you wait with that basket of chips for quite a while before your food comes. When your food arrives, it does not come with salsa. As it turns out, if you want salsa with your food you have two choices:\n\n(1) Eat your chips without salsa, so you can save the salsa for your food. C'mon son. This might not be objectively unreasonable, but it's unreasonable in light of custom: what Mexican restaurant expects you to eat chips without salsa?\n\n(2) Purchase more salsa to go with your food, at the rate of $0.50 per small cup.\n\nAdmittedly, $0.50 is not a big deal, but the idea that the only way to enjoy salsa with your food at this Mexican restaurant is to either pay extra or eat your chips without salsa just reeks of, dare I say it, arrogance. It's like they're so gassed up over people telling them how dope their salsa is that they think they're doing us a favor by letting us eat there. \n\nI get it. You're world-famous for your salsa. You sell the salsa separately in a jar. People would probably consume insane amounts of the salsa if you didn't regulate it somehow.... but is it going to kill you to give me one cup of salsa with my chips and one cup of salsa with my food? I mean, seriously, that just comes off as really, really cheap. I purchase a $30 fast-Mexican meal for two and have to pay extra to get the salsa? How is that cost not built into my $10 burrito?? \n\nThis is the kind of disregard for customer perspective that causes once-great businesses to fail. Not saying I see Papalote failing anytime soon, but it was a *huge* turnoff for me and I probably won't eat there again because of that last straw. Two people can eat at Rubio's (which actually has very good food for fast-Mexican), spend $20 and enjoy several cups of their delicious salsas or free! The mind boggles.\n\nAlso, the salsa is tasty, but not something I would have thought to rave about if Papalote wasn't already well-hyped for its salsa. Despite really wanting to love my dining experience at Papalote, I walked away not understanding what the fuss is about. So disappointed.\n\n______________\n\n* I love my girlfriend, but I'm not the type to give a place a shitty review just because she had a bad experience (see my review of Sushi Raw if you have any doubts). That being said, her burrito was so skimpy on prawns that I was disappointed just *watching* her eat it. It was like watching someone pick the wrong door on a game show over and over again: bite after bite with not a prawn in sight.\n\n** I KNOW!!", "rating": 2, "date": "2011-09-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The prawns, generously doled and flavorfully grilled, added a unique texture to the sour cream, guac and cheese. \n\n"], "author": "Bobbin W.", "review": "I sifted through a bunch of hipster reviews during my SF research and noticed consistent high ratings for Papalote, adding it to my list of Mission Musts.

So we booked it to Papalote and earned a spot as the last lucky party to score a table in the small dining area. A staff member brought us each our own handful of chips in two bowls, along with little containers of orange, creamy, spicy salsa--quite different from the tomato chunks I'm used to. \n\nI ordered a prawn burrito, making it a super for only 99 cents. I appreciated the tortilla choices (spinach, flour, whole wheat and Roma tomato), opting for the spinach, as well as the bean options (pinto, refried and black).

Yesterday I decided to try the bean and cheese dip which turns out to be refried black beans with melted cheese. I asked if it came with a large bowl of chips and the gal at the counter ensured it did. So by my calculations we ordered two items for two people, one of which was supposed to have lots of chips. We got one bowl before the tacos and another bowl, same size with the dip. I kept asking the busser for another bowl but he knows the rules so he ignored my pleas. When I went to the counter the gal said they only have one size bowl. I reminded her she had said it came with a large serving of chips but that went right past her. She gave me another bowl but I could see contempt in her eyes as she handed it to me. Here's the thing, what is dip for if not chips? Secondly, the price for beans and cheese with a small bowl of chips would be fair at $3.50, still a huge mark-up. The actual price of $6.50 is just dumb, especially considering you don't get any type of garnish or extra chips. It's literally a plate of beans with melted cheese. Don't bother with this menu item. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because the tacos and salsa are so good.

It seems like every person who has ever even step foot within a 500 mile radius of the Mission district feels obligated to chime in and remind me that, yes, Mexican food in Boston sucks, and Mission burritos are tastier.  After years of this, I began to think that this was, in fact, a fact (yeah, intentional), and that my trip to San Fransisco would give me an epiphany and a fantastic culinary experience to boot.\n\nBack to the task at hand.  I went to the Mission and chose Papalote for my field research, as it seemed to be widely accepted as the \"best burrito.\"  \n\nI should have known that something was awry when the guy at the counter told me they had just whooped Bobby Flay in a Throwdown.  I call this the Flay phenomenon - The inevitable inflow of traffic post-TV-debut brings crowds to a Throwdown winner's establishment that the restaurant perhaps wasn't ready for (or ill-equipped to handle).  I fear this, as a once-fabulous place could go downhill quickly, choosing to ride the popularity wave.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not have such a great experience here, and whether it's the show's fault or the restaurant's, I left a bit let down.\n\nThe prices are steep - $5.50 for an order of two tacos, and this \"famous\" burrito now costs $20. WHAT?  What do you put in a burrito to make it $20.  I will tell you this - this place charges extra for cheese, sour cream, and guac, so I'm not sure what's left.\n\nWe did not go for the $20 burrito, but we had a more modest $9 version, but did not opt to pay the extra for the dairy and guac.  The burrito (chicken) was, as a result, a bit bland and very dry.  If the burrito only tastes good with these extra-charge add-ons, then why bother making the burrito at all? \n\nWe also had an order of fish tacos, an order of chicken, and an order of beef.  The fish tacos were the only ones that were double-wrapped with two tortillas each, and the other two orders were only single-wrapped.  Is this \"authentic\"?  I am not sure, as I am not well-versed in corn tortilla etiquette, but I thought the customary-two was the standard.\n\nThe sole-double-wrapped fish taco was really wet and drippy, but I enjoyed that the fish wasn't battered and deep fried to the point of nonrecognition.  Rather, the fish in the tacos was abundant, moist, and juicy.  The other two tacos tasted just like each other, and were both very dry.\n\nThe best thing about this place was definitely the creamy, spicy salsa that accompanied the chips.  Perhaps this has always been the practice, or maybe it was due to the new-found extreme popularity, but after the first complimentary order, the restaurant charges for refills.  I don't necessarily think that this is a bad practice, just an interesting one I'd not seen before.  Because we bought so much food, however, we were able to get 4 orders of these for free, and I opted to ditch the tacos and make a meal out of chips and salsa.\n\nYou can buy this salsa by the jar to go, and had we not been from out of town, I would certainly take advantage of that.\n\nI will say that the employees are ALL extremely friendly.  Everyone is kind, courteous, and polite.  We must have gone at a bizarre hour, because there was no line whatsoever.   Food came out hot and prompt, and I was very pleased with the experience aside from the taste of the food.\n\nI don't think I'd go back, but one great thing did come from the experience.  Now, back at home, when people launch a tirade about how much New England Mexican sucks compared to the beloved Mission Burritos, I am able to smile, nod, and smirk knowingly (and perhaps a bit judgmentally) as they ramble on, while silently thinking that Olecito is better Mexican food than what I found in SF.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["I like that you can make it super for 99 cents, which includes guacamole, cheese, and sour cream.

Then, I wanted to try it even more when I read an article recently that named this place the Best Burrito in America.... I can't tell you the excitement I had inside- it was overwhelming.\n\nOf course, the place was packed inside. It's a very small, cozy place with only a few tables... The seating is somewhat communal style, where you may or may not have to share the same table with other parties... It has a cool, vibe to it- fits right in in the Mission neighborhood.\n\nYou order at the front counter and then are asked to wait outside until they are able to seat your party. \n\nObviously I ordered the $19.95 Triple Threat Burrito (Don't worry- I shared this with one other person) as that's the very burrito that beat out Bobby Flay and was mentioned in the article... P.s. It's an extra $0.99 for guacamole ... Why wouldn't a $20 burrito already have guacamole in it? (That extra $0.99 is actually for cheese, sour cream and guacamole but I don't eat cheese or sour cream) \n\nOnce seated, they will bring you chips and salsa (it more looks like a slightly thick, smooth orangey sauce)... The chips are mediocre, but the salsa is really unique tasting and really yummy! \n\nThe burrito was served very shortly after. It's huge! Thank goodness we decided to share.  So the burrito was really good... Really, really good... Probably the best meat I've ever had in a burrito- the pieces of steak and chicken are lean and big and juicy and flavorful; very different from many Mexican food places where the meat is always greasy, minced to an oblivion and full of weird, chewy and fatty bites where you aren't quite sure what you just put in your mouth (icky)... The shrimp is grilled to perfection and also bursting with flavor... All the meats are cooked to order and you really could taste the freshness in the cooking- it keeps you excited for each and every bite that you take.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal... The high quality of the meat is definitely the highlight of this place.... But to me, they really need to improve their chip recipe and the fact that this place isn't what you would consider to be typical \"Mexican taqueria style\" food threw me off a little from what I was expecting... Also, in my opinion, America's best burrito is definitely not going to have black beans inside it. \n\nOkay, so maybe it's not the best burrito in my book, but I would say this place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area. \n\nNote: This place has tons of vegetarian options which was really cool to me.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["Comes with a small bowl of chips and salsa on side.

I'm not going to just meekly accept the assumption that all burritos from this area are better than anywhere else without validating this myself though.    \n\nGoing on a picturesque Sunday evening in August, it was surprisingly not too packed.  I have had longer waits at Chipotle.  The clientele here included mainly tourists and hipsters, here because of their devotion to a good burrito.  \n\nPapalote is REALLY proud of the fact that their \"Triple Threat\" (steak, chicken, shrimp) burrito beat Iron Chef Bobby Flay's.  It's prominently advertised and mentioned by Papalote groupies.  And they charge $20.  I asked a friend who is a Papalote devotee if she wanted to split it, but was told it's not really that big.  But still $20?  Yeah, no thanks.\n\nSo you order at Papalote by telling them what you want, getting a number, taking it to your table, and waiting for them to bring it out.  I ordered the chicken burrito and got a Horchata too.  On to the chips and salsa.  The salsa is pretty awesome.  It tasted like a fire-roasted tomato-based red salsa, but is a little creamy too.  The chips were standard.  The horchata was a tad sweet for my taste.\n\nThe burrito came out after roughly 10 minutes.  Time to dig in!  Wait . . . no foil and it's on a plate?  Surely I don't have to eat this burrito with knife and fork? That's a little too formal for me, so I used my hands and picked it up.  First bite and I liked the flavor of the burrito.  The chicken seemed shredded.  A little dry.  As I continued to eat it, it was good, but it did not wow me or fill me up at the end of the meal.  A good burrito.  Add a little salsa as you eat the burrito and it's better.  But this experience has inspired me to try other joints in the Mission for my next visit.

Erm, must be the alkie? :X  \n\nIt's 1 AM on Thursday Morning and while I should be \"attempting\" to sleep, my eyes are glued to  an episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\". For 26 minutes, my mouth was salivating at the thought of meeting the \"Triple Threat\" one day; needless to say, it was another sleepless night. *sigh*\n\nMy friends and I came here yesterday at 12ish and luckily, we came at just the right time before it started getting busy.\n\nFOOD:\n*Chips & Salsa (#46 on the 7x7 list): The chips were slightly warm, thin, and crisp with just the right amount of salt. Ahhhhh, the salsa....the BEST freaking salsa EVER! The salsa was emulsified to perfect creamy consistency. As it hits your palette and moves around your mouth, you can taste all the fresh ingredients (the charred tomatoes, garlic, onion, chilies, and cilantro) sink into your taste buds. It had the perfect blend of savory, smokiness, acidity, and fiery kick to it! This is the ONLY thing that lives up to the HYPE!\n\n*Triple Threat (super w/ sour cream & guac): HOLY MOLEY! $20 for a freaking burrito?!?!? The burrito was a regular size burrito that you would find from any taqueria. It was generously filled with rice, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. The rice was al-dente and the chicken breast, carne asada, and shrimp were perfectly grilled, well-seasoned, and tender. The sour cream and guac are a must as it added a slight tartness and creaminess to balance out all the flavors.\n\n*Ode to Poleng Adobe Burrito: FAIL! If you're expecting the garlicy, peppery soysauce vinegary taste that makes your lips pucker type of Adobo, you will be sadly disappointed. The chicken lacked all the components of what an adobo should be and was not well-seasoned. Errr, where was the garlic friend rice? The rice used was the standard burrito rice. The tortilla was the only thing that stood out. It was different from the typical tortilla used; it was crisp and flaky. All in all, the burrito lacked any real flavor and was quite dry b/c there was no sauce or salsa in it).\n\nDRINKS:\nPapalote has a selection of sodas, juices, and Mexican beer. I have to note that their refrigeration system was not working properly yesterday as our drinks were room temperature.\n\nPRICES:\nWAY OVERPRICED! A regular burrito is about $8 and an extra $1 to make it super (sour cream and guac). The size of their regular burritos are quite small (approx 7' and 2.5' in diameter) compared to other taquerias in The Mission.\n\nAlthough the Triple Threat was good; it was NO where near a $20 good! To me, Mexican food is just like Chinese food; you shouldn't have to pay much to get good-tasting food. And, I really think the \"hype\" has allowed Papalote to capitalize on its customers by charging such ludicrous prices. \n\nSERVICE:\nOrder your food at the counter, grab a number, and the server will being you your order when it's ready. The chips and salsa came first and it took about 15 minutes to get our burritos.    \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery funky hipster type feel with the bright red walls with colorful panting and reggae music playing in the background. \n\nPARKING: \nDifficult street parking around Valencia and Mission streets. However, Guerrero street seemed to have some available non-metered spots. \n\nWould I return? I would only return for the chips and salsa. Other than that, Papalote is WAY OVERYHYPED and OVERPRICED.

You want awesome chips?  Tropisueno's got awesome chips!  The salsa, however, was bangin'.  Unfortunately, I can't take the heat, and one tiny taste set my entire mouth on fire.  It was good, yes, but painful.  \n\nSo, why the 3.5 stars?  This review seems to suggest a solid 4, maybe more, right?  Well, I mean, I definitely LIKED my burrito, but it was just...not totally 100% there. . .  \n\nYou know what I mean?  Imagine meeting a person, or attending a class, and even though he/she/it is perfectly fine and nice and all, you're just not blown away.  \n\nAnd you could go either way, go with it, or not.  That's kind of how I felt about Papalote after my meal.  Certainly a decent meal, but I'm not about to jump around recommending it to everyone I know.  \n\nNo, no, that shameless plugging is still reserved for my all-time favorite, El Farolito. \n\nBut Papalote?

It seems like every person who has ever even step foot within a 500 mile radius of the Mission district feels obligated to chime in and remind me that, yes, Mexican food in Boston sucks, and Mission burritos are tastier.  After years of this, I began to think that this was, in fact, a fact (yeah, intentional), and that my trip to San Fransisco would give me an epiphany and a fantastic culinary experience to boot.\n\nBack to the task at hand.  I went to the Mission and chose Papalote for my field research, as it seemed to be widely accepted as the \"best burrito.\"  \n\nI should have known that something was awry when the guy at the counter told me they had just whooped Bobby Flay in a Throwdown.  I call this the Flay phenomenon - The inevitable inflow of traffic post-TV-debut brings crowds to a Throwdown winner's establishment that the restaurant perhaps wasn't ready for (or ill-equipped to handle).  I fear this, as a once-fabulous place could go downhill quickly, choosing to ride the popularity wave.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not have such a great experience here, and whether it's the show's fault or the restaurant's, I left a bit let down.\n\nThe prices are steep - $5.50 for an order of two tacos, and this \"famous\" burrito now costs $20. WHAT?  What do you put in a burrito to make it $20.  I will tell you this - this place charges extra for cheese, sour cream, and guac, so I'm not sure what's left.\n\nWe did not go for the $20 burrito, but we had a more modest $9 version, but did not opt to pay the extra for the dairy and guac.  The burrito (chicken) was, as a result, a bit bland and very dry.  If the burrito only tastes good with these extra-charge add-ons, then why bother making the burrito at all? \n\nWe also had an order of fish tacos, an order of chicken, and an order of beef.  The fish tacos were the only ones that were double-wrapped with two tortillas each, and the other two orders were only single-wrapped.  Is this \"authentic\"?  I am not sure, as I am not well-versed in corn tortilla etiquette, but I thought the customary-two was the standard.\n\nThe sole-double-wrapped fish taco was really wet and drippy, but I enjoyed that the fish wasn't battered and deep fried to the point of nonrecognition.  Rather, the fish in the tacos was abundant, moist, and juicy.  The other two tacos tasted just like each other, and were both very dry.\n\nThe best thing about this place was definitely the creamy, spicy salsa that accompanied the chips.  Perhaps this has always been the practice, or maybe it was due to the new-found extreme popularity, but after the first complimentary order, the restaurant charges for refills.  I don't necessarily think that this is a bad practice, just an interesting one I'd not seen before.  Because we bought so much food, however, we were able to get 4 orders of these for free, and I opted to ditch the tacos and make a meal out of chips and salsa.\n\nYou can buy this salsa by the jar to go, and had we not been from out of town, I would certainly take advantage of that.\n\nI will say that the employees are ALL extremely friendly.  Everyone is kind, courteous, and polite.  We must have gone at a bizarre hour, because there was no line whatsoever.   Food came out hot and prompt, and I was very pleased with the experience aside from the taste of the food.\n\nI don't think I'd go back, but one great thing did come from the experience.  Now, back at home, when people launch a tirade about how much New England Mexican sucks compared to the beloved Mission Burritos, I am able to smile, nod, and smirk knowingly (and perhaps a bit judgmentally) as they ramble on, while silently thinking that Olecito is better Mexican food than what I found in SF.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["I love the free chips and salsa and all the usual suspects (tacos, burritos and quesadillas) are very good.

I have no idea what they do to it, but it is the perfect amount of spiciness for me, and I love the smokiness of the chilies in there.  I usually pour more of the salsa onto my burrito, which is so huge I eat it with a knife and fork.  I have yet to order them, but the nachos look amazing.  Definitely a two-person order, they look like a huge mound of cheesy deliciousness.

Well I finally was able to have my answer this past week. \n\nAfter deliberating where to go, we decided to go to Papalote for their chips and salsa. While browsing their menu online I noticed something odd. Everyone on Yelp kept posting pictures of the Triple Threat Burrito however I saw it no where on the menu. Turns out it is their signature item that was featured on Bobby Flay's show Throwdown. \n\nBasically its a huge burrito stuffed with steak, chicken and shrimp however you do need to pay $1 extra to make it super. To me it is weird that isn't included in the price but ok. My friend and I agreed to split the burrito plus get chips, extra salsa and two beers. We both ended up paying $18 for just that so keep that in mind. \n\nFor what its worth, the salsa is unlike any other salsa I have had. From color, consistency and all the way down to flavor there is a complexity to their salsa that is well worth trying. The chips did not appear to be anything out of the ordinary but I would recommend trying the salsa at least one time. \n\nThe steak was sensational, the best I have had so far from any mexican restaurant. It was juicy, flavorful and fork tender. I would gladly go back for their carne asada burrito. \n\nChicken was fine, good portion and seasoned adequately but no real highs or lows.\n\nAs for the shrimp, the addition of the 4 pieces felt a little underwhelming, and left me wondering why was it even in there to begin with. The quality was good and cooked well but didn't find it be a valid \"threat\".\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nSalsa is delicious and well worth trying as well as the carne asada but be warned Papalote isn't a cheap grab and go burrito kind of place", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-08-10"}, {"excerpts": ["I regretted not asking for extra salsa. \n\n"], "author": "Sofia R.", "review": "I stopped by here before leaving for class because I was really curious about their Mexipino burrito.\n\nMexipino burrito is supposed to be a fusion of Mexican and Filipino food.

That's about all I can say.\n\nMy gripes:\n1) You can't \"mix and match\" your tacos - meaning, if you want to try two kinds of meat, you have to end up with 4 tacos. See, typically I go to taquerias and get 2 or 3 tacos, each with a different protein so I can sample. Much to my dismay, when I asked about this the nice lady said I have to get the 2 tacos.  That's kind of crappy.\n\n2) The chile verde was pretty bad.  Despite having some heat, it was otherwise bland from the flavor side.  The pork was fake-tender. By that I mean, you could break of pieces easiily with a fork, but it was still dry. Clearly it had been simmering for too long in too high of heat. Even I, the home cook, know this - poor technique in the kitchen.  The scary part? I asked the cashier if she recommended the chile verde or the chicken mole, and she said chile verde. I'm terrified of how crappy the mole might be.\n\n3) The tacos come covered in lettuce and tomatoes. What?  Why? There's so much of it too. I appreciate wanting to promote eating veggies and all, but I came here to eat a taco - with meat.  Not ok.\n\n4) Guacamole - was also bland. I had to add some salt. There was no limey zip, and I'm not even sure how but I didn't really get the flavor of avocado. \n\n5) Service - When the gentleman brought out my tacos, I asked about my side of guac. He looked at the ticket in his hand, which I also saw, and it clear said \"Chile Verde, Guacamole.\" He seemed very confused. My friend also pointed out that on her (separate) order, she had asked and paid for 2 extra salsas and those were not brought out either. He seemed confused and flustered. Eventually we got everything we needed but it wasn't like he was bringing out multiple plates of food at once. He literally was only carrying my tacos in one hand and the ticket that clearly stated \"Guacamole\" in the other.  Also, on an unrelated note - flies in the air. Not ideal.\n\nThis place is probably great for vegetarians/vegans who otherwise can't get Mexican food, but for us meat eaters, don't bother.  \n\n2 stars for the salsa.

I came here for an early dinner and the place was not terribly crowded- we were able to get a table without any wait. I ordered a quesadilla with grilled zucchini and eggplant. I also spent quite a bit extra ($2.75 to be exact) to have a side of guacamole with this quesadilla. Why so much  money for a little dollop of mashed avocado? Can't answer that one. The waitress was clearly confused when I placed my order, since the the overhead board said that additional sides were only a dollar. But then again I also asked her if the vegan quesadilla had cheese in it, and she said yes so I knew she was not completely with the program. After a few unsuccessful attempted inquiries as to why the guacamole was more expensive than advertised,  I decided to just let it go, as I was getting rather hungry. The food came relatively quickly- in the meantime we snacked on chips and some very spicy salsa. Again, I don't see what the hype is about. The salsa was just that- salsa. Nothing extraordinary. In fact, I prefer fresh salsa, if anything. In any event, when the much awaited quesadilla finally arrived I was very excited to see that it was chock full of roasted veggies and not overly greasy or soggy. The cheese was relatively light- a white cheese (quesa fresca perhaps?) and the roasted vegetables were a delicious compliment.

And these beans, which made up far too much of the burrito, melded together with the salsa, watery guacamole, and who knows what else to become a really drippy, nasty sauce.

The seating is somewhat communal style, where you may or may not have to share the same table with other parties...

I have had longer waits at Chipotle.

But still $20?  Yeah, no thanks.\n\nSo you order at Papalote by telling them what you want, getting a number, taking it to your table, and waiting for them to bring it out.  I ordered the chicken burrito and got a Horchata too.  On to the chips and salsa.  The salsa is pretty awesome.  It tasted like a fire-roasted tomato-based red salsa, but is a little creamy too.  The chips were standard.  The horchata was a tad sweet for my taste.\n\nThe burrito came out after roughly 10 minutes.  Time to dig in!  Wait . . . no foil and it's on a plate?  Surely I don't have to eat this burrito with knife and fork? That's a little too formal for me, so I used my hands and picked it up.  First bite and I liked the flavor of the burrito.  The chicken seemed shredded.  A little dry.  As I continued to eat it, it was good, but it did not wow me or fill me up at the end of the meal.  A good burrito.

Thank god for free water! It was nice and cold too.

I don't live too far from here so I figured I'd rather eat it at home. The price point was pretty standard, although a lot of places like Taqueria Canc\u00fan are cheaper and (spoiler) better.\n\nWhen I opened the bag and took out the well sized burrito I was pretty happy, but still nothing out of the ordinary so far. Underneath the burrito I realized that the nacho chips (which are complementary like many burrito places in SF) were just lying out at the bottom of the paper bag, which was kind of disappointing. After a struggle to tear the paper bag in a way that would make it a suitable plate for the chips, I was only disappointed to find their spicy rendition of nacho cheese dip to be... well, mediocre. But complaining about a complementary side, maybe I'm just spoilt.\n\nThe burrito, this is where my still to be four star rating for the place dropped to three. It wasn't bad by any regard, but since burritos are quite the large food to tackle, I like them to be good to the very last bite. Unfortunately the first of this one told me this was going to be a challenge, albeit not a hardest one. It was rolled somewhat loosely, I didn't how ridiculously thin the tortilla was, and the ingredients weren't causing the orgasm in my mouth that other burritos have caused me to expect. I actually even payed the extra dollar or two it takes to get a super burrito with the guac, something I usually love, but something was just missing.\n\nBeing in the mission, unless you're ridiculously hungry and right outside this place, I'd reccomend going to one of the many other burritos around.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Amidst my mountains of rice and beans, though, I found maybe only a couple pieces of steak.

Ahhhhh, the salsa....the BEST freaking salsa EVER! The salsa was emulsified to perfect creamy consistency. As it hits your palette and moves around your mouth, you can taste all the fresh ingredients (the charred tomatoes, garlic, onion, chilies, and cilantro) sink into your taste buds. It had the perfect blend of savory, smokiness, acidity, and fiery kick to it! This is the ONLY thing that lives up to the HYPE!\n\n*Triple Threat (super w/ sour cream & guac): HOLY MOLEY! $20 for a freaking burrito?!?!? The burrito was a regular size burrito that you would find from any taqueria. It was generously filled with rice, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. The rice was al-dente and the chicken breast, carne asada, and shrimp were perfectly grilled, well-seasoned, and tender. The sour cream and guac are a must as it added a slight tartness and creaminess to balance out all the flavors.\n\n*Ode to Poleng Adobe Burrito: FAIL! If you're expecting the garlicy, peppery soysauce vinegary taste that makes your lips pucker type of Adobo, you will be sadly disappointed. The chicken lacked all the components of what an adobo should be and was not well-seasoned. Errr, where was the garlic friend rice? The rice used was the standard burrito rice. The tortilla was the only thing that stood out. It was different from the typical tortilla used; it was crisp and flaky. All in all, the burrito lacked any real flavor and was quite dry b/c there was no sauce or salsa in it).\n\nDRINKS:\nPapalote has a selection of sodas, juices, and Mexican beer. I have to note that their refrigeration system was not working properly yesterday as our drinks were room temperature.\n\nPRICES:\nWAY OVERPRICED! A regular burrito is about $8 and an extra $1 to make it super (sour cream and guac). The size of their regular burritos are quite small (approx 7' and 2.5' in diameter) compared to other taquerias in The Mission.\n\nAlthough the Triple Threat was good; it was NO where near a $20 good! To me, Mexican food is just like Chinese food; you shouldn't have to pay much to get good-tasting food. And, I really think the \"hype\" has allowed Papalote to capitalize on its customers by charging such ludicrous prices. \n\nSERVICE:\nOrder your food at the counter, grab a number, and the server will being you your order when it's ready. The chips and salsa came first and it took about 15 minutes to get our burritos.    \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery funky hipster type feel with the bright red walls with colorful panting and reggae music playing in the background. \n\nPARKING: \nDifficult street parking around Valencia and Mission streets. However, Guerrero street seemed to have some available non-metered spots. \n\nWould I return? I would only return for the chips and salsa. Other than that, Papalote is WAY OVERYHYPED and OVERPRICED.

I walk by every day and see the ridiculously long lines and tons of people ALWAYS waiting, but in my quest to find the best burrito spot in the mission I had to try it. When I walked by and the front door wasn't overflowing with hungry San Franciscans I knew it was now or never. I ordered a Carne Asada Super Burrito. \"Do you mind waiting 20 minutes?\" she asks. What? For a burrito?! But they are supposed to be good... \"Uhm, OK...\" So I walked around the corner to my house and waited patiently for the 20 minutes to pass then went back, waited five minutes more, and headed home. I tried a chip on the way (the best tell tale sign of a good burrito spot!) and... god damn it. Fresh, crunchy, delicious. I get home and open up the fancy little salsa tub... oh no! It's delicious too. I intrepidly peel back the foil and take a bite of the burrito, and my worst fears are realized: hot, flavorful, juicy steak. Wonderfully grilled tortilla... tasty rice and beans. Its good... its really good. \n\nI don't think the attitude or ridiculously long wait time was excusable, but these people have a hot commodity on their hands and everybody wants some.

Larger than my forearm, this creation included chunks of tender carne asada, smoked prawns, succulent achiote chicken, rice, beans and slightly piquant papalote salsa. He made it super by adding fresh guacamole, cheese and  sour cream. The marriage between all of the ingredients worked magically, I wouldn't change a single thing about this burrito. Though the price is fairly steep ($19.99), it can easily be shared among two people and the quality and taste alone are enough for me to pay the whooping fee each and every time. The papalote salsa is pretty epic, though not as spicy as I'd like it to be. The roasted tomatoes and chili provide a bit of a smokey flavor, the salsa is a full-bodied/robust work of art boasting in both flavor and aroma. I purchased one to take home and finished it in three days. I built my own burrito as well and the menu allows for optimal customization if you don't want one of their signature burritos. I was able to chose between the type of beans, rice, meat and tortilla I wanted. I basically built myself a super healthy burrito (brown rice, wheat tortilla, black beans, chicken), however it was still ridiculously delicious and better than anything Chiptole could ever manufacture for me. I highly recommend any of their burritos, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nPrice: On the pricier end and they'll tack on more for adding any extra ingredients. However, the food here is certainly worth the price every time. \n\nAmbiance: Small, simple and clean.

But aside from the poor taste, the texture was... saucy. Not goopy, not gloppy, not bean-y. Saucy. And these beans, which made up far too much of the burrito, melded together with the salsa, watery guacamole, and who knows what else to become a really drippy, nasty sauce. Burritos are meant to have all of the components stay separate while being wrapped together, not seem like they've gone through a blender together to become homogenized. It was really, really bad.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jwb3vTh8rn3OsN9wlI56-Q?select=eKBq5WSoQVZabdWyZf25qQ)\n\nI did a doubletake on the $20 price tag but, it is, what it is and halved it with a coworker. This is what food history tastes like.\n\nOverall, it's good, probably a 3 star burrito with 1 star value but I'll give them 4 stars because Bobby Flay is an arrogant SOB.

Then, I wanted to try it even more when I read an article recently that named this place the Best Burrito in America.... I can't tell you the excitement I had inside- it was overwhelming.\n\nOf course, the place was packed inside. It's a very small, cozy place with only a few tables... The seating is somewhat communal style, where you may or may not have to share the same table with other parties... It has a cool, vibe to it- fits right in in the Mission neighborhood.\n\nYou order at the front counter and then are asked to wait outside until they are able to seat your party. \n\nObviously I ordered the $19.95 Triple Threat Burrito (Don't worry- I shared this with one other person) as that's the very burrito that beat out Bobby Flay and was mentioned in the article... P.s. It's an extra $0.99 for guacamole ... Why wouldn't a $20 burrito already have guacamole in it? (That extra $0.99 is actually for cheese, sour cream and guacamole but I don't eat cheese or sour cream) \n\nOnce seated, they will bring you chips and salsa (it more looks like a slightly thick, smooth orangey sauce)... The chips are mediocre, but the salsa is really unique tasting and really yummy! \n\nThe burrito was served very shortly after. It's huge! Thank goodness we decided to share.  So the burrito was really good... Really, really good... Probably the best meat I've ever had in a burrito- the pieces of steak and chicken are lean and big and juicy and flavorful; very different from many Mexican food places where the meat is always greasy, minced to an oblivion and full of weird, chewy and fatty bites where you aren't quite sure what you just put in your mouth (icky)... The shrimp is grilled to perfection and also bursting with flavor... All the meats are cooked to order and you really could taste the freshness in the cooking- it keeps you excited for each and every bite that you take.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal... The high quality of the meat is definitely the highlight of this place.... But to me, they really need to improve their chip recipe and the fact that this place isn't what you would consider to be typical \"Mexican taqueria style\" food threw me off a little from what I was expecting... Also, in my opinion, America's best burrito is definitely not going to have black beans inside it. \n\nOkay, so maybe it's not the best burrito in my book, but I would say this place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area. \n\nNote: This place has tons of vegetarian options which was really cool to me.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["burrito of steak, chicken adobo, and shrimp, for $20!

Chicken had some sort of dry (emphasis on DRY) rub on it to give it \"flavor.\" I ordered my burrito with no rice (because that's how you do it) so I had a chance to get some beans which were ok when drenched in the house salsa.\n\n4. My girlfriend ordered a VEGETARIAN burrito which was MOSTLY RICE and even included some grill CHUNKS OF BURNED MEAT. Obviously, this Mission establishment caters to mostly non-Latinos, many of whom (just a stretch since this is San Francisco we are talking about) are vegetarian. However, they do not separate or clear their grill for vegetarian orders. Minor to me since I eat meat but the GF, not so happy.\n\nTo bring it back around to the \"best burrito in SF,\" Papalote is what I call a \"gentrification joint.\"  With the influx of non-Latinos into a traditionally Latino neighborhood, we see more and more places pop up that water down the \"tradicional,\" you know, to keep the neighborhood \"authentico\" and \"diverse\" with its new inhabitants. In come things like \"voting for best you fill in the blank.\"\n\nI have no advice for Paplote because they have found a niche and have even expanded into--surprise!--the NoPa neighborhood. \n\nThe best burrito in SF they are not. To get that, you now have to venture way past the \"best of\" signs further out in the Mission and find that little place where meat is still slow cooked, beans are painstakingly prepared for days, tortillas come fresh off the grill, peppers marinate forever, and the abuelita behind the counter has trouble understanding you when you make you order in English.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-03-16"}, {"excerpts": ["I asked the cashier if she recommended the chile verde or the chicken mole, and she said chile verde.

Is the salsa delicious? Absolutely. That's about all I can say.\n\nMy gripes:\n1) You can't \"mix and match\" your tacos - meaning, if you want to try two kinds of meat, you have to end up with 4 tacos. See, typically I go to taquerias and get 2 or 3 tacos, each with a different protein so I can sample. Much to my dismay, when I asked about this the nice lady said I have to get the 2 tacos.  That's kind of crappy.\n\n2) The chile verde was pretty bad.  Despite having some heat, it was otherwise bland from the flavor side.  The pork was fake-tender. By that I mean, you could break of pieces easiily with a fork, but it was still dry. Clearly it had been simmering for too long in too high of heat. Even I, the home cook, know this - poor technique in the kitchen.  The scary part? I asked the cashier if she recommended the chile verde or the chicken mole, and she said chile verde. I'm terrified of how crappy the mole might be.\n\n3) The tacos come covered in lettuce and tomatoes. What?  Why? There's so much of it too. I appreciate wanting to promote eating veggies and all, but I came here to eat a taco - with meat.  Not ok.\n\n4) Guacamole - was also bland. I had to add some salt. There was no limey zip, and I'm not even sure how but I didn't really get the flavor of avocado. \n\n5) Service - When the gentleman brought out my tacos, I asked about my side of guac. He looked at the ticket in his hand, which I also saw, and it clear said \"Chile Verde, Guacamole.\" He seemed very confused. My friend also pointed out that on her (separate) order, she had asked and paid for 2 extra salsas and those were not brought out either. He seemed confused and flustered. Eventually we got everything we needed but it wasn't like he was bringing out multiple plates of food at once. He literally was only carrying my tacos in one hand and the ticket that clearly stated \"Guacamole\" in the other.  Also, on an unrelated note - flies in the air. Not ideal.\n\nThis place is probably great for vegetarians/vegans who otherwise can't get Mexican food, but for us meat eaters, don't bother.  \n\n2 stars for the salsa.

There was a line afterwards. The place is on the small side, and it's unclear if you're supposed to claim your own table or follow the \"please wait to be seated\" sign. There are pretty dragonfly artworks on the ceiling.\n\nWe started with the $1.50 chips and salsa. Unlike other places these aren't bottomless. The amount we were given was just under what we needed, especially given how great the salsa was. (The chips are pretty standard issue.) \n\nThe salsa had a nice roasted flavor and was unlike any other salsa I've ever had. It was a light orange color and looked slightly creamy, though I can't imagine them adding cream to it. (Do they?) It was so good we went back a few hours later for some salsa to take home. For $6.50 you can get a full jar. Even though it's in a jar it's fresh salsa and it'll only last a few days.\n\nWe each got a pair of tacos for $4.95. One set had pollo (grilled chicken breast), the other carne asada (grilled steak). For some reason they don't let you mix and match your meats.

I regretted not paying the extra 99 cents to make it a \"super\" with guac, sour cream, and cheese. I asked at the counter if I could have the super accoutrements on the side. Initially they balked and wanted me to pay the $2.99 for a whole side of guacamole, but I talked them into giving me just a small side of guac for the 99 cents.

So, i could barely even taste the green chili and the pork was rather dry and cut too large.

The three of us all being foodies - talk of food was inevitable as dinner time approached us.\n\nJB mentioned a burrito place that had recently been featured on \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\".  Now, I like Bobby as a person more than a chef, and I do enjoy this show from time to time but I had missed this episode.  But my interest was piqued in learning that Bobby had lost to the \"triple threat burrito\" at Papalote, so we started walking to check the place out for dinner.\n\nWell, as we expected, there was a massive line of people wanting to try the place that had beaten the Iron Chef.  As it turned out, there were more people waiting for their placed order than wanting to order, so we were able to squeeze right through to the counter.\n\nAll three of us wanted the Triple Threat.  \nAll three of us gawked at the price: $20.\n\nTWENTY DOLLARS?\nThe first natural question was: how big is it?\nAnswer:  same size as the other burritos... that average out at about $7.50 in cost.\n\n*(looking around the room to make sure I'm on earth)*\n\nON WHAT PLANET DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?????????\n\nSame size - 1/3 portion of beef, chicken and shrimp....\nAlmost 3X in cost.\n\nFOR WHAT?\n\nForget that!

Examining the receipt, it became clear that we had been charged for fish tacos, a beef burrito AND a chicken burrito.\n\n(Annoying.)\n\nThe chips were decent, and their \"special secret sauce\" (salsa) was pretty good in concept but overly salted, and not quite what *I* want from \"salsa\".  Nonetheless, it was tasty.\n\nThe burritos arrive.\nRegular size.\nI was SO not a fan of the Monterey Jack cheese - in cold state, not melted - that they sprinkle on everything.  Yuck.  Took a bite of the chicken/beef burrito - and the only noteworthy thing was the chicken was well marinaded/seasoned.  The rest?  Unimpressive.  Overall, for the burrito, I'd have given it three stars.\n\nI tried the fish taco - and the fish was fresh and not deep-fried, the lettuce was crisp - but the cheese, as much as I tried to take it all off, ruined it for me.  If I had asked for no cheese - I would have given it three stars too.\n\nThere's a MUCH better burrito to be had at El Metate for a fraction of the cost and even better ambiance with better drinks and service, too.  ($5 for a burrito there - try it!)\n\nThe experience of eating at Papalote, due to the hype, was worth it.  The company made the whole night fun.  Perhaps, if we had been insane enough to splurge $20 to eat a burrito - my assessment would be higher.  But for a $20 burrito, I expect it to give me wings, and based on other reviews - nobody sprouted wings and took off.  It's unfortunate for the owners as they'd be making a WHOLE lot more money off the recent coverage if they charged $10 for the Triple Threat instead of attempting to price gouge their customers for $20.  Whatever number of Triple Threats they are selling right now for $20, they could sell 10X that amount had they charged $10.  Do the math.\n\nCoincidentally - upon arriving home later in the evening, the very episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\" came on TV and I watched it with the remnants of Papalote's burrito and fish taco in my stomach.\n\nBobby was as cute as ever, and based on ingredients alone, I'd have preferred his \"green burrito\".

"], "author": "Heather G.", "review": "On the recommendation of a local, we headed to Papalote to sample what I've always heard to be superior Mexican food to what we have here in Boston.  \n\nCan I just interject and describe to you how completely obnoxious it is to live in Boston and, on a regular basis, hear San Fransisco transplants berate me about the low quality and in-authenticity of Mexican food in the Northeast?  It seems like every person who has ever even step foot within a 500 mile radius of the Mission district feels obligated to chime in and remind me that, yes, Mexican food in Boston sucks, and Mission burritos are tastier.  After years of this, I began to think that this was, in fact, a fact (yeah, intentional), and that my trip to San Fransisco would give me an epiphany and a fantastic culinary experience to boot.\n\nBack to the task at hand.  I went to the Mission and chose Papalote for my field research, as it seemed to be widely accepted as the \"best burrito.\"  \n\nI should have known that something was awry when the guy at the counter told me they had just whooped Bobby Flay in a Throwdown.  I call this the Flay phenomenon - The inevitable inflow of traffic post-TV-debut brings crowds to a Throwdown winner's establishment that the restaurant perhaps wasn't ready for (or ill-equipped to handle).  I fear this, as a once-fabulous place could go downhill quickly, choosing to ride the popularity wave.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not have such a great experience here, and whether it's the show's fault or the restaurant's, I left a bit let down.\n\nThe prices are steep - $5.50 for an order of two tacos, and this \"famous\" burrito now costs $20. WHAT?  What do you put in a burrito to make it $20.  I will tell you this - this place charges extra for cheese, sour cream, and guac, so I'm not sure what's left.\n\nWe did not go for the $20 burrito, but we had a more modest $9 version, but did not opt to pay the extra for the dairy and guac.  The burrito (chicken) was, as a result, a bit bland and very dry.  If the burrito only tastes good with these extra-charge add-ons, then why bother making the burrito at all? \n\nWe also had an order of fish tacos, an order of chicken, and an order of beef.  The fish tacos were the only ones that were double-wrapped with two tortillas each, and the other two orders were only single-wrapped.  Is this \"authentic\"?  I am not sure, as I am not well-versed in corn tortilla etiquette, but I thought the customary-two was the standard.\n\nThe sole-double-wrapped fish taco was really wet and drippy, but I enjoyed that the fish wasn't battered and deep fried to the point of nonrecognition.  Rather, the fish in the tacos was abundant, moist, and juicy.  The other two tacos tasted just like each other, and were both very dry.\n\nThe best thing about this place was definitely the creamy, spicy salsa that accompanied the chips.  Perhaps this has always been the practice, or maybe it was due to the new-found extreme popularity, but after the first complimentary order, the restaurant charges for refills.  I don't necessarily think that this is a bad practice, just an interesting one I'd not seen before.  Because we bought so much food, however, we were able to get 4 orders of these for free, and I opted to ditch the tacos and make a meal out of chips and salsa.\n\nYou can buy this salsa by the jar to go, and had we not been from out of town, I would certainly take advantage of that.\n\nI will say that the employees are ALL extremely friendly.  Everyone is kind, courteous, and polite.  We must have gone at a bizarre hour, because there was no line whatsoever.   Food came out hot and prompt, and I was very pleased with the experience aside from the taste of the food.\n\nI don't think I'd go back, but one great thing did come from the experience.  Now, back at home, when people launch a tirade about how much New England Mexican sucks compared to the beloved Mission Burritos, I am able to smile, nod, and smirk knowingly (and perhaps a bit judgmentally) as they ramble on, while silently thinking that Olecito is better Mexican food than what I found in SF.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["But our soyrizo, pollo asado, and chicken mole quesadillas were taking an eternity. \n\n", "The soyrizo quesadilla was excellent.

I wish I knew what Papalote was like before it was featured on Throwdown. Was the triple threat always $20? Back then, $20 was a lot of cash for a burrito and it still is now, but at least that burrito hasn't been affected by inflation in these past few years. Also, the hype has calmed down compared to those crowds after the episode first aired. \n\nTriple Threat - chicken breast, carne asada, prawns:\nIt's loaded with 3 types of proteins, but I don't feel threatened. The taste and quality is on par with most burritos, so in comparison, the price tag sure is steep. The grilled prawns were the best part. They're tender and springy with a nice char. Plus, the prawns are left whole instead of chopped up beyond recognition. The chicken and carne asada are nicely seasoned, too. \nIt is a very large burrito, so if you need a reason to justify spending $20, you can share it or split it between two meals. It's also a good decision if you have a tough time choosing between poultry, beef, & seafood, or if you're just curious to try it, but it is not a must have.\n\nThe Carne Asada & Pollo Asado burritos are pretty good too, sans shrimp. The single meat burritos are about $10, which is a little pricey. Adding cheese, guac, or sour cream are each $1. Kind of a bummer, since burritos usually include cheese. If you're going to add one, you might as well add all 3 for $2, resulting in a very creamy burrito. \n\nOf course the roasted tomato salsa is excellent. It is the true threat here.

This salsa is excellent on their thin, warm chips, as well as on everything else.

And these beans, which made up far too much of the burrito, melded together with the salsa, watery guacamole, and who knows what else to become a really drippy, nasty sauce.

If you responded \"Papalote\" ... ding ding ding!\n\nSeriously, as much as I like El Farolito (of which I am also a fan), Papalote will likely be in the mix for my go to spots for Mexican fare, even though I have mixed feelings.  As far as authenticity and value, Papalote is lacking, so I can see where others are coming from when they reduce Papalote as merely a fancy Chipotle, though I don't agree.  Also, Papalote's burritos are slightly smaller and pricier than its Mission counterparts.  \n\nOn the other hand.  It's hard to argue with the quality, especially the famed roasted tomato salsa. \n\nOverrated?  Nope, I don't think so.  Papalote's burrito and quesadilla were simply delicious, no exaggerated flavors.  In my view, Papalote deserves all the pub that comes with being named as SF Weekly's \"best burrito\" every year since 2007.  Now the Food Network has taken notice.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was off the chain, with tender beef and rich flavor and the burrito was not overly salted.  Plus it was just the right size that it wont leave you stuffed and bloated after the meal.\n\nHowever, the highlight of my meal was the camarones quesadilla, which features shrimp sauteed in white wine and butter with delicious melted cheese...seriously, this is very very good stuff.  Add to that the flavor of the roasted peppers, with a dab of roasted tomato salsa and a bottle of coke on the side...I'd say that's a winning combo.\n\nUnfortunately, the only damper was that the chips we got were too hard and they might have been a little stale.  It didn't matter too much in the end.  The roasted tomato salsa was so good that I could have dipped cardboard in it and I would have enjoyed the meal.\n\nThank you; Chef Escobedo.

Then, I wanted to try it even more when I read an article recently that named this place the Best Burrito in America.... I can't tell you the excitement I had inside- it was overwhelming.\n\nOf course, the place was packed inside. It's a very small, cozy place with only a few tables... The seating is somewhat communal style, where you may or may not have to share the same table with other parties... It has a cool, vibe to it- fits right in in the Mission neighborhood.\n\nYou order at the front counter and then are asked to wait outside until they are able to seat your party. \n\nObviously I ordered the $19.95 Triple Threat Burrito (Don't worry- I shared this with one other person) as that's the very burrito that beat out Bobby Flay and was mentioned in the article... P.s. It's an extra $0.99 for guacamole ... Why wouldn't a $20 burrito already have guacamole in it? (That extra $0.99 is actually for cheese, sour cream and guacamole but I don't eat cheese or sour cream) \n\nOnce seated, they will bring you chips and salsa (it more looks like a slightly thick, smooth orangey sauce)... The chips are mediocre, but the salsa is really unique tasting and really yummy! \n\nThe burrito was served very shortly after. It's huge! Thank goodness we decided to share.  So the burrito was really good... Really, really good... Probably the best meat I've ever had in a burrito- the pieces of steak and chicken are lean and big and juicy and flavorful; very different from many Mexican food places where the meat is always greasy, minced to an oblivion and full of weird, chewy and fatty bites where you aren't quite sure what you just put in your mouth (icky)... The shrimp is grilled to perfection and also bursting with flavor... All the meats are cooked to order and you really could taste the freshness in the cooking- it keeps you excited for each and every bite that you take.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal... The high quality of the meat is definitely the highlight of this place.... But to me, they really need to improve their chip recipe and the fact that this place isn't what you would consider to be typical \"Mexican taqueria style\" food threw me off a little from what I was expecting... Also, in my opinion, America's best burrito is definitely not going to have black beans inside it. \n\nOkay, so maybe it's not the best burrito in my book, but I would say this place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area. \n\nNote: This place has tons of vegetarian options which was really cool to me.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-04-19"}, {"excerpts": ["burrito of steak, chicken adobo, and shrimp, for $20!

The shrimp pieces were small and really fresh.  The carne asada was a hit or miss depending on the piece I got.  I had initially picked out a piece and that was dry but when eating it with the burrito, it tastes pretty tender and fresh.  I like that even though the pieces are big, they rip apart easily.  \n\nUnfortunately, by super-ing it, you get grilled veggies (bell peppers?) in it and it doesn't really go.  Also, the flavor in the burrito was weak so the salsa is quite necessary.  Now the hype about the salsa is interesting because it is good and it is really spicy but the texture is weird.  It's very blended and not quite smooth but not quite chunky... a strange in between.\n\nSalsa comes from two places:\n1. Made in this restaurant - $5.99 \n2.

Ahhhhh, the salsa....the BEST freaking salsa EVER! The salsa was emulsified to perfect creamy consistency. As it hits your palette and moves around your mouth, you can taste all the fresh ingredients (the charred tomatoes, garlic, onion, chilies, and cilantro) sink into your taste buds. It had the perfect blend of savory, smokiness, acidity, and fiery kick to it! This is the ONLY thing that lives up to the HYPE!\n\n*Triple Threat (super w/ sour cream & guac): HOLY MOLEY! $20 for a freaking burrito?!?!? The burrito was a regular size burrito that you would find from any taqueria. It was generously filled with rice, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. The rice was al-dente and the chicken breast, carne asada, and shrimp were perfectly grilled, well-seasoned, and tender. The sour cream and guac are a must as it added a slight tartness and creaminess to balance out all the flavors.\n\n*Ode to Poleng Adobe Burrito: FAIL! If you're expecting the garlicy, peppery soysauce vinegary taste that makes your lips pucker type of Adobo, you will be sadly disappointed. The chicken lacked all the components of what an adobo should be and was not well-seasoned. Errr, where was the garlic friend rice? The rice used was the standard burrito rice. The tortilla was the only thing that stood out. It was different from the typical tortilla used; it was crisp and flaky. All in all, the burrito lacked any real flavor and was quite dry b/c there was no sauce or salsa in it).\n\nDRINKS:\nPapalote has a selection of sodas, juices, and Mexican beer. I have to note that their refrigeration system was not working properly yesterday as our drinks were room temperature.\n\nPRICES:\nWAY OVERPRICED! A regular burrito is about $8 and an extra $1 to make it super (sour cream and guac). The size of their regular burritos are quite small (approx 7' and 2.5' in diameter) compared to other taquerias in The Mission.\n\nAlthough the Triple Threat was good; it was NO where near a $20 good! To me, Mexican food is just like Chinese food; you shouldn't have to pay much to get good-tasting food.

Now, I like Bobby as a person more than a chef, and I do enjoy this show from time to time but I had missed this episode.  But my interest was piqued in learning that Bobby had lost to the \"triple threat burrito\" at Papalote, so we started walking to check the place out for dinner.\n\nWell, as we expected, there was a massive line of people wanting to try the place that had beaten the Iron Chef.

Took a bite of the chicken/beef burrito - and the only noteworthy thing was the chicken was well marinaded/seasoned.  The rest?  Unimpressive.  Overall, for the burrito, I'd have given it three stars.\n\nI tried the fish taco - and the fish was fresh and not deep-fried, the lettuce was crisp - but the cheese, as much as I tried to take it all off, ruined it for me.  If I had asked for no cheese - I would have given it three stars too.\n\nThere's a MUCH better burrito to be had at El Metate for a fraction of the cost and even better ambiance with better drinks and service, too.  ($5 for a burrito there - try it!)\n\nThe experience of eating at Papalote, due to the hype, was worth it.  The company made the whole night fun.  Perhaps, if we had been insane enough to splurge $20 to eat a burrito - my assessment would be higher.  But for a $20 burrito, I expect it to give me wings, and based on other reviews - nobody sprouted wings and took off.  It's unfortunate for the owners as they'd be making a WHOLE lot more money off the recent coverage if they charged $10 for the Triple Threat instead of attempting to price gouge their customers for $20.  Whatever number of Triple Threats they are selling right now for $20, they could sell 10X that amount had they charged $10.  Do the math.\n\nCoincidentally - upon arriving home later in the evening, the very episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\" came on TV and I watched it with the remnants of Papalote's burrito and fish taco in my stomach.\n\nBobby was as cute as ever, and based on ingredients alone, I'd have preferred his \"green burrito\".

Looked at the online menu and there was no Triple Threat. Had the little lady call in an order for us. One TT and one Chile Verde. 25 mins later, I show up to pick up my order and the nice young lady at the counter tells me the total is $32. I looked up at the menu board and there's a small plastic sign taped to it that reads Triple Threat Burrito $19.99. WTF? \n\nIt was a Wednesday night and the place was unusually packed...alot more than usual. All of the staff members were wearing Throwndown shirts and they looked really overwhelmed by the crowds of people coming in and the telephone ringing off the hook.

Of course that's what we had to try.  It arrives taking up more of a plate than is reasonable for a burrito.  But that's what it should do for $20.  And yes, it did take ~15 minutes to arrive, but that's ok in my book, since it was clear everything was freshly cooked.  Again, not your average burrito.  We had to taste each element independently, and each was fantastic on its own.  The shrimp were nicely spiced and well cooked.  The chicken was not too salty (a frequent problem I've noticed with seasoned chicken), and the steak was simple but awesome.

After ordering 2 of these burritos with a couple minor add-ons, the lady said \"it'll be ready in 45 minutes and it'll be $45.\" What?!?! Seriously? We thought she heard our order wrong, like we ordered 5-10 burritos. But no, she was serious; that was the price for 2. We were so shocked that we ended up cancelling the order.\n\nAfter doing some research on Yelp, we found out that as soon as the show aired, they jacked the price up by $5. Pretty messed up, but apparently there was high enough demand.\n\nA few months later, we finally decided to give it a try. My girlfriend and I split one of the Triple Threat burritos. I must say, it was pretty good. It's not often that you get shrimp, chicken, and carne asada all on one burrito. The orange sauce was excellent as well. Lots of flavor, and we also had some with our chips.\n\nBut in the end, I cannot justify paying $20+ for a burrito, especially in the Mission, where there is seemingly a taqueria every other store.

It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd come back here- it's just not a good value.\n\nI've tried Papalote's food before. I have vague memories of eating there before I lived in SF and I'd had their takeout at a friend's house before. I don't remember being blown away by it, but I don't remember hating it either. Then again, I'm from Socal, so Mexican food is one category in which SF tends to let me down.\n\nFast forward to last night. We get there and, though the wait was somewhat long, the staff was so friendly and attentive that it wasn't a bother at all. \n\nI ordered the soyrizo burrito (not particularly adventurous, but it's what I was in the mood for). It was just okay, not any better or worse than what I might make at home using store-bought soyrizo. I wasn't unhappy with my meal, but I wasn't impressed. I'd rate it 3 stars on its own. \n\nMy girlfriend's burrito was a different story. She orded the lime-seasoned prawn burrito, but the seasoning was so bland that she actually thought they'd given her the wrong burrito! I asked the (very polite and attentive) waitress if perhaps they'd prepared her the shrimp burrito with the butter-wine sauce by mistake, but it turns out it was the right burrito, just not a very good one.*\n\nThe other problem, besides flavor, was the number of prawns. This was an $11 burrito that had 4 smallish prawns in it. I don't expect it to be loaded up like a shrimp burrito, but I eat a lot of Mexican food and I know what $11 should buy me. I am not a diner with a sense of entitlement, I just don't want to feel ripped off. 4 tiny prawns just isn't gonna cut it in a huge burrito. It was basically a beans, rice and cheese burrito w/ a cameo appearance by some prawns.\n\nThe biggest surprise though, was the salsa. Papalote is renowned for their salsa. So I found it surprising that a Mexican place famous for its salsa DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY SALSA WITH YOUR FOOD.... YOU HAVE TO BUY IT. **\n\nI am, as my obnoxious use of capital letters might indicate, dead serious: Salsa with your chips is free, but you have to pay to have salsa with your food. \n\nYou get a small (maybe 2 oz) cup of salsa with your chips. The place is popular, so you wait with that basket of chips for quite a while before your food comes. When your food arrives, it does not come with salsa. As it turns out, if you want salsa with your food you have two choices:\n\n(1) Eat your chips without salsa, so you can save the salsa for your food. C'mon son. This might not be objectively unreasonable, but it's unreasonable in light of custom: what Mexican restaurant expects you to eat chips without salsa?\n\n(2) Purchase more salsa to go with your food, at the rate of $0.50 per small cup.\n\nAdmittedly, $0.50 is not a big deal, but the idea that the only way to enjoy salsa with your food at this Mexican restaurant is to either pay extra or eat your chips without salsa just reeks of, dare I say it, arrogance. It's like they're so gassed up over people telling them how dope their salsa is that they think they're doing us a favor by letting us eat there. \n\nI get it. You're world-famous for your salsa. You sell the salsa separately in a jar. People would probably consume insane amounts of the salsa if you didn't regulate it somehow.... but is it going to kill you to give me one cup of salsa with my chips and one cup of salsa with my food? I mean, seriously, that just comes off as really, really cheap. I purchase a $30 fast-Mexican meal for two and have to pay extra to get the salsa? How is that cost not built into my $10 burrito?? \n\nThis is the kind of disregard for customer perspective that causes once-great businesses to fail. Not saying I see Papalote failing anytime soon, but it was a *huge* turnoff for me and I probably won't eat there again because of that last straw. Two people can eat at Rubio's (which actually has very good food for fast-Mexican), spend $20 and enjoy several cups of their delicious salsas or free! The mind boggles.\n\nAlso, the salsa is tasty, but not something I would have thought to rave about if Papalote wasn't already well-hyped for its salsa. Despite really wanting to love my dining experience at Papalote, I walked away not understanding what the fuss is about. So disappointed.\n\n______________\n\n* I love my girlfriend, but I'm not the type to give a place a shitty review just because she had a bad experience (see my review of Sushi Raw if you have any doubts). That being said, her burrito was so skimpy on prawns that I was disappointed just *watching* her eat it.

I was kind of incredulous.  You think if someone has just spent a shitload of money--22 BUCKS for ONE MEAL at a fucking taqueria you could throw three prawns at them.  he was just an asshole and said you ordered wrong too bad.  So I walked back and spit out my WINE AND BUTTER soaked nasty ass shrimp that had no flavor.  \n\nThen they brought the fajitas out and they gave us ONE tortilla and I was so pissed by then I couldn't even complain for fear they guy would be like--\"well it only comes with one tortilla--tough.\"\n\nSo I left the place so pissed because I really wanted my FAVORITE taqueria to be my friend's favorite new place and maybe she would like it enough to come into the city more.\n\nI was so upset that I decided to call the manager--who was the rude guy to complain--and guess what he was a dick then too.  I even told him that it was my favorite taqueria and instead of eating near my school in Potrero Hill sometimes--there are porbably 20 taqueria between it and Papalote I truck there.  \n\nI was a regular customer--but that's what shitty customer service can do.

Healthy, gourmet-esque, burritos? With roasted vegetables? Posers.\n\nBut then I got older and started to not really want to feel kinda sick every time I ate a burrito. I'm not knockin' the more traditional (yes, yes, I know, burritos are not really from Mexico - but there is a burrito standard nonetheless, at least here in SF) burrito joints. I still go to them, they're awesome, but sometimes I'm craving a burrito but still want to sleep at night without feeling like I'm about to explode.\n\nSo I went to Papalote, just a few years back. Yummy chips, very fresh. Definitely a plus. Tasty jicama salad - unusual. Roasted salsa - a bit cheeky, but I gotta admit, pretty damn good. And shrimp cooked in white wine burrito - niiiiiice.\n\nSo now I work Papalote into my burrito rotation.

Unfortunately the meats -- namely, the chile verde, carne asada and grilled chicken -- tend to be dry and a bit tough, possibly because it appears that the pork, beef and chicken are cooked with virtually all their fat trimmed away; even so, they are well-seasoned and thus quite enjoyable, especially when dispatched in a super burrito, which keeps the moisture level up by way of sour cream, cheese and guacamole.

Now, I like Bobby as a person more than a chef, and I do enjoy this show from time to time but I had missed this episode.  But my interest was piqued in learning that Bobby had lost to the \"triple threat burrito\" at Papalote, so we started walking to check the place out for dinner.\n\nWell, as we expected, there was a massive line of people wanting to try the place that had beaten the Iron Chef.  As it turned out, there were more people waiting for their placed order than wanting to order, so we were able to squeeze right through to the counter.\n\nAll three of us wanted the Triple Threat.  \nAll three of us gawked at the price: $20.\n\nTWENTY DOLLARS?\nThe first natural question was: how big is it?\nAnswer:  same size as the other burritos... that average out at about $7.50 in cost.\n\n*(looking around the room to make sure I'm on earth)*\n\nON WHAT PLANET DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?????????\n\nSame size - 1/3 portion of beef, chicken and shrimp....\nAlmost 3X in cost.\n\nFOR WHAT?\n\nForget that!

Examining the receipt, it became clear that we had been charged for fish tacos, a beef burrito AND a chicken burrito.\n\n(Annoying.)\n\nThe chips were decent, and their \"special secret sauce\" (salsa) was pretty good in concept but overly salted, and not quite what *I* want from \"salsa\".  Nonetheless, it was tasty.\n\nThe burritos arrive.\nRegular size.\nI was SO not a fan of the Monterey Jack cheese - in cold state, not melted - that they sprinkle on everything.  Yuck.  Took a bite of the chicken/beef burrito - and the only noteworthy thing was the chicken was well marinaded/seasoned.  The rest?  Unimpressive.  Overall, for the burrito, I'd have given it three stars.\n\nI tried the fish taco - and the fish was fresh and not deep-fried, the lettuce was crisp - but the cheese, as much as I tried to take it all off, ruined it for me.  If I had asked for no cheese - I would have given it three stars too.\n\nThere's a MUCH better burrito to be had at El Metate for a fraction of the cost and even better ambiance with better drinks and service, too.  ($5 for a burrito there - try it!)\n\nThe experience of eating at Papalote, due to the hype, was worth it.  The company made the whole night fun.  Perhaps, if we had been insane enough to splurge $20 to eat a burrito - my assessment would be higher.  But for a $20 burrito, I expect it to give me wings, and based on other reviews - nobody sprouted wings and took off.  It's unfortunate for the owners as they'd be making a WHOLE lot more money off the recent coverage if they charged $10 for the Triple Threat instead of attempting to price gouge their customers for $20.  Whatever number of Triple Threats they are selling right now for $20, they could sell 10X that amount had they charged $10.

I asked if it came with a large bowl of chips and the gal at the counter ensured it did. So by my calculations we ordered two items for two people, one of which was supposed to have lots of chips. We got one bowl before the tacos and another bowl, same size with the dip. I kept asking the busser for another bowl but he knows the rules so he ignored my pleas. When I went to the counter the gal said they only have one size bowl. I reminded her she had said it came with a large serving of chips but that went right past her. She gave me another bowl but I could see contempt in her eyes as she handed it to me. Here's the thing, what is dip for if not chips? Secondly, the price for beans and cheese with a small bowl of chips would be fair at $3.50, still a huge mark-up.

"], "author": "Heather G.", "review": "On the recommendation of a local, we headed to Papalote to sample what I've always heard to be superior Mexican food to what we have here in Boston.  \n\nCan I just interject and describe to you how completely obnoxious it is to live in Boston and, on a regular basis, hear San Fransisco transplants berate me about the low quality and in-authenticity of Mexican food in the Northeast?  It seems like every person who has ever even step foot within a 500 mile radius of the Mission district feels obligated to chime in and remind me that, yes, Mexican food in Boston sucks, and Mission burritos are tastier.  After years of this, I began to think that this was, in fact, a fact (yeah, intentional), and that my trip to San Fransisco would give me an epiphany and a fantastic culinary experience to boot.\n\nBack to the task at hand.  I went to the Mission and chose Papalote for my field research, as it seemed to be widely accepted as the \"best burrito.\"  \n\nI should have known that something was awry when the guy at the counter told me they had just whooped Bobby Flay in a Throwdown.  I call this the Flay phenomenon - The inevitable inflow of traffic post-TV-debut brings crowds to a Throwdown winner's establishment that the restaurant perhaps wasn't ready for (or ill-equipped to handle).  I fear this, as a once-fabulous place could go downhill quickly, choosing to ride the popularity wave.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not have such a great experience here, and whether it's the show's fault or the restaurant's, I left a bit let down.\n\nThe prices are steep - $5.50 for an order of two tacos, and this \"famous\" burrito now costs $20. WHAT?  What do you put in a burrito to make it $20.  I will tell you this - this place charges extra for cheese, sour cream, and guac, so I'm not sure what's left.\n\nWe did not go for the $20 burrito, but we had a more modest $9 version, but did not opt to pay the extra for the dairy and guac.  The burrito (chicken) was, as a result, a bit bland and very dry.  If the burrito only tastes good with these extra-charge add-ons, then why bother making the burrito at all? \n\nWe also had an order of fish tacos, an order of chicken, and an order of beef.  The fish tacos were the only ones that were double-wrapped with two tortillas each, and the other two orders were only single-wrapped.  Is this \"authentic\"?  I am not sure, as I am not well-versed in corn tortilla etiquette, but I thought the customary-two was the standard.\n\nThe sole-double-wrapped fish taco was really wet and drippy, but I enjoyed that the fish wasn't battered and deep fried to the point of nonrecognition.  Rather, the fish in the tacos was abundant, moist, and juicy.  The other two tacos tasted just like each other, and were both very dry.\n\nThe best thing about this place was definitely the creamy, spicy salsa that accompanied the chips.  Perhaps this has always been the practice, or maybe it was due to the new-found extreme popularity, but after the first complimentary order, the restaurant charges for refills.  I don't necessarily think that this is a bad practice, just an interesting one I'd not seen before.  Because we bought so much food, however, we were able to get 4 orders of these for free, and I opted to ditch the tacos and make a meal out of chips and salsa.\n\nYou can buy this salsa by the jar to go, and had we not been from out of town, I would certainly take advantage of that.\n\nI will say that the employees are ALL extremely friendly.  Everyone is kind, courteous, and polite.  We must have gone at a bizarre hour, because there was no line whatsoever.   Food came out hot and prompt, and I was very pleased with the experience aside from the taste of the food.\n\nI don't think I'd go back, but one great thing did come from the experience.  Now, back at home, when people launch a tirade about how much New England Mexican sucks compared to the beloved Mission Burritos, I am able to smile, nod, and smirk knowingly (and perhaps a bit judgmentally) as they ramble on, while silently thinking that Olecito is better Mexican food than what I found in SF.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-11-13"}, {"excerpts": ["Last time I had a fish burrito, there were bitter spots in almost every piece of fish.
