Outside, the marquee says \"Lung Shan Restaurant,\" but inside, the heart and soul of the restaurant is the famous Mission Chinese Food. The decor also looks nothing like a typical, drab Chinese-American restaurant--instead, there are colorful dragons dancing along the ceiling, along with a cutout of Michael Jordan, Mickey Mouse, and strings of Christmas lights. What??\n\nAnd then there's the menu. Some of the items may have a Chinese food-sounding names, but the descriptions are anything but! We started with the spicy sichuan Kimchi in spicy macadamia oil and the amazing fried Westlake lamb dumplings served with tzatziki sauce and spicy chili oil! The lamb dumplings were a standout for me--the flavor of the lamb somehow went so well with the creamy tzatziki sauce, and the chili oil gave everything a spicy-numbing tinge.\n\nNext, we had the cabbage cooked with pistachio milk, which was a nicely seasoned vegetable dish, as well as the Mongolian longbeans, a huge platter of fried beans with horseradish and Sichuan peppercorns. The matcha meyer lemon noodles were just as interesting as the name sounds--the noodles sat in a matcha-infused broth and were dressed with cucumber, radish, and herbs. But the definite favorite dish of our group was the lamb and squid ink pappardale. The thick strands of black pasta were perfectly al dente and had the most amazing texture, and they were complemented with tender pieces of lamb shoulder, along with harissa yogurt, fennel, onion, and watercress. The flavors of the dish were reminiscent of a Chinese stir-fry (\"wok-hay\"), but the dish also had a distinctly Mediterranean/Italian feel--fascinating!\n\nIndeed, Mission Chinese was a cool, memorable experience.

I rounded up 8 close friends who are as down to devour whatever lands in front of them as I am, and we set off on our \"Mission\" to the Mission to try out this spot.\n\nWe arrived to find a line outside the red glowing doorway, and we could just barely make out the sounds of the EDM/Dance/Trance soundtrack playing inside. The smells coming from inside were so ta filling, and my excitement grew with each sweep of the breeze that carried new aromas right to my nostrils. I couldn't wait for our new to be called, and just as I started to wonder when we'd get in, our table was called! \n\nId finally made it and I felt like I was entering hallowed ground as I passed through the doorway into the warm, dark and humid dining room, illuminated by glowing red lights and guarded by a giant golden Chinese dragon overhead. At first I was bothered by the temperature, wondering if id be able to enjoy my meal, but that quickly faded as I began to peruse the menu. The dishes here are like nothing you've seen before, bringing together traditional Chinese ingredients in some very inspired and non-traditional ways. \n\nAs a crew that likes to eat and drink, we had about 12-14 dishes on the table for the 9 diners, and by the end of it all, the carnage was something to behold. We ordered the Mongolian Long beans, stir fried with dried Asian chiles, Serrano chiles and chile paste, the Tiki Pork Belly exterior crisped to perfection and complimented by the unctuous and meaty interior and sweet sauce, 3X Bacon with Rice Cakes and Bitter Melon, Tiger Salad, Squid Ink Noodles, Cod Fried Rice, Sour Chili Chicken, Explosively spicy wings and more!\n\nMy favorite bit was the 3X Bacon, thin slices of lightly smoked pork belly served with chewy Chinese rice cakes and thinly sliced bitter melon, was an incredible bite of food. The bacon was thin but meaty with a light charcoal/hardwood smoked flavor that played really well with the bitterness of the bitter melon and spicy/savory/salty sauce and the rice cake added the perfect texture. I couldn't stop eating this combo throughout the meal. \n\nThe surprise of the night was the Tiger Salad. Described as simple and light by our server, this dish arrived and had us all confused. On a long plate stood three bundles of lightly dressed fresh herbs, ties together by wide pieces of chow fun rice noodles. They were roughly 3-4\" tall! The freshness of the salad was the perfect contrast to the rich and spicy dishes on the table, and I would suggest this as something anyone who comes should order.\n\nThe star of the night was the squid ink noodles, which are served with cumin spiced and charred lamb, harissa, a few fresh greens and a tangy yogurt sauce. As with a lot of Asian food, texture is important and the noodles added that beautifully. The ground lamb was delicate and delicious, providing a warm spice from the cumin, which combined nicely with a light heat from the Harissa. The surprise ingredient was the yogurt sauce, which rounded out and carried all of the flavors across your palate, bringing you back for more.  These are clearly freshly made noodles, and taking this to go would ruin their perfectly chewy texture, which is why it's only available dine in, and well worth waiting for!\n\nBite after bite of this spicy fare had me mopping my brow and downing glass after glass of reasonably priced, moderately cold, sake, which in turn had me focused on the next bite and forgetting about the warmth in the room. We passed dishes for what seemed like an enjoyable eternity, and when we examined our efforts, we all sat back satiated and smiling knowing Mission Chinese has left us much more to explore in a future visit. Tingly lamb face noodle soup, Kung Pao Pastrami, and so much more!\n\nOn a scale of one to hype, this place is all that and a bag of fried wontons!

My tongue almost instantly turned numb, and even after brushing my teeth twice mid-meal (another nice benefit of eating from home, though one I've never had to employ before or since), I could not manage to completely get the taste out of my mouth.\n\nTo be perfectly fair, the rest of the meal was tainted by this first course disaster. But of the 4 other items we tried (kung pao pastrami, salt cod fried rice, tiger salad, pork jowl), they ranged from moderately decent to completely forgettable, albeit each with another heavy hand of spices that sunk any chances of enjoying these otherwise quite creative dishes.\n\nYes, you may argue that delivery was a bad choice. Or that the wings were the entirety of the problem. Maybe you're right; I'm just calling it like I see it.

Arriving at a little after 7 PM on a Tuesday evening, we stood outside with the crowd on the street and waited for 45 minutes as assorted homeless indigents encouraged us to \"help them out\". When our table was ready, we found the interior of the restaurant to be somewhat dilapidated and decorated in a weird mish-mash of cheap Chinese restaurant decor (a few red \"scrolls\" and lanterns), Chinese gift shop (specifically, the extra-large blow-up dragon hanging from the ceiling) with a college dorm room (namely the white Christmas lights strewn around the restaurant). On top of that, they play hip hop not too inconspicuously: chowing down while listening to Bone Thugs and Ludacris, I was left unsure as to whether or not I should be getting up and busting a move.\n\nFood items:\nBeer-brined Sichuan pickle: pickled napa cabbage that was moderately salty and just a little sour from the beer, a decent starter that would've been better with rice.\n\nSmashed cucumbers in garlic sauce: essentially fresh smashed small cucumbers served with garlic hummus and fresh minced chilies. Delicious, but only vaguely Chinese.\n\nTiger salad: some assorted bitter greens encompassed by a single layer of wide rice noodle, with a mostly unidentifiable and totally forgettable vinagrette (?). I feel somewhat ashamed for having ordered this, but to our credit, some prior Yelp pictures had us mistaking this for the beer-brined Sichuan pickle.\n\nSavory egg custard: a new dish per our waitress, it is essentially a egg custard (almost like a chilled version of what you get at Korean BBQ) served in tomato water with a decent amount of uni, trout roe, and minced shiso leaves. Separately, all these components are actually delicious. Together, they formed a cold hodge-podge with no common element, a sum that is less than the individual parts.\n\nSliced peanut noodles: perfectly cooked wide rice noodles served with a slightly watered down peanut sauce. I like my peanut sauce actually heavy on the peanut, but the effective cooking of the he-fen left me envious.\n\nThrice cooked bacon: holy cow, is this dish smoky. Crispy and yet not completely dried out pieces of chewy bacon are stir-fried with slightly numbing chilies, thin slivers of bitter melon, all in chili oil. A potent combination that was hard to resist picking at even when full.\n\nSizzling cumin lamb: for those of you who cannot handle gamey meats, this dish brought the barnyard along with the lamb on the plate. The meat is certainly tender and well prepared, at least. I was looking for a heavier hand with the cumin; I may in fact stir-fry my leftovers with more cumin.\n\nSalt cod fried rice: our favorite dish of the night. A very delicately prepared (if that is possible for fried rice) dish with good balance of salt, sweet from the chinese sausage, and starch with just a tiny shred of lettuce to keep it tasting slightly fresh. It honestly reminded me of late nights of post-clubbing Chinese food back in Boston, a cleaner and less funky version of salted chicken and fermented fish fried rice served in venues like Chow Chau City.\n\nVerdict: apparently we came to this restaurant looking for Chinese food, and what we found was...50% something else. At over $40 a head for this level of meh (even though we have a boatload of leftovers), I'm actually very surprised that Danny Bowien won the James Beard for Rising Star Chef.

The first time we had the Thrice-Cooked Bacon, I thought it was absolutely incredible. My taste buds were dancing like there was no tomorrow, haha. The rice cakes in that dish were especially marvy. The Tea-Smoked Eel is served sushi-style in fresh noodle wrappers, and is really good. Same goes for the Tiger Salad, which is much larger and you know, has salad stuff in it. Nice appetizer. The Hainam Chicken Rice is *very* tasty.

First off, the name does not do it justice.  This is soup and not some mish-mash of veggies, which is what I would think based on the name.  It's three mushroom/veggie dumpling in this broth that was just out of this world.

Very stimulating to my eyes/ears (the smoke wafting from the sizzling goodness), nose (earthy, cumin/onion goodness), and mouth.  Oh the flavors and the texture!  The meat was very tender and although it was at times fatty, it was complemented by the crisp onions that soaked up all the cumin lamb flavors.  Yum!  5 stars.\n\nOverall - For all of that, it amounted to less than $40.  It really could have fed 3-4 people, but since I was soooo hungry, it only fed two of us.  But then again, I barely ate the rest of the day cause I was so full.  Definitely the value here is great.  Service though was just okay.  Granted, it was new year's day and apparently their regular people weren't working (it was the cook giving us our teapot, but forgetting the tea cups).

I finally went last night and wished I had gone a few years ago - or not at all. My husband and I found the food to be disappointing (actually awful). It wasn't creative or innovative - or unique in any way. Most dishes were overly salted, and so spicy & greasy that it masked any flavor that might have been.   I guess our expectations were too high based on past reviews.  We had the Tiger Salad - fresh kale type greens wrapped in a soggy noodle doused in soy and vinegar. I added the peanuts to give it some help. The cumin lamb ribs had a blackened crust that was dry & tasted like bark (not the tasty bark of long roasted beef), no flavor of cumin, and the interior was all fat - we casted them aside. The trice cooked bacon and rice cakes were soggy, all stuck together and was nothing like the description on the menu - we pushed that dish aside too. What was good was the spicy beef chow mein - wished we had two orders of it and called it a day. I'm sure I sound like I'm overly harsh but when a restaurant and chef receives such high accolades they should try to live up to them. We spent a fair amount of money to try different dishes that our server recommended as \"top dishes\".  Maybe we missed some of the good ones.\n To be fair, from the line to get in, people still are willing to wait to dine at Mission Chinese - so there must be something I'm missing.

I'm just a simple lo-fan so I know not what I speak of, however, I did grow up eating northern chinese cuisine at my buddy's house three times a week so I think I have the right to say a little something. Also, I've been to china several times recently, so have dipped my beak in the fountain of authenticity.\n\nEvery time I liked it, but something was just a little off.  First, the Ma Po Tofu.  The first couple times, I really liked it - very hot, a little greasy, lovely szechuan peppercorn tingle, good light texture to the sauce, a peppery burn - very interesting, if the flavors were somehow not quite spot on.  Unfortunately, they have now changed the recipe, which gives it a deeper meatier flavor, but that meaty flavor now overwhelms the Tofu, and turns a relatively light, spicy dish into a heavy gloopy meat stew that has a texture closer to Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee than anything else.  Af first I was puzzled about the change, but I asked the chef about it and he said that he had indeed changed the recipe.  Not sure what to say about it - I still kind of liked it, but it reminded me of nothing so much as the sucking sound that comes when one pours Spaghetti-O's out of a can.  \n\nHome made pickles.  Love-em.\n\nPork BBQ in cocacola sauce?  Not really chinese, but mmm tasty.\n\nBeef cheeks?  Meh - just a little bit off.\n\nTingly Lamb Soup - just ok, a bit overwhelmed by the pepper corn.\n\nTiger Salad.

We have tons of wine left over from a recent party so I thought it would be nice to take a bottle or two.  I called to ask and received a long 10 seconds of \"uuuummmm\" from the guy who answered the phone.  He put me on hold to ask someone else and came back with \"no you can't bring your own wine\".  I thought that was odd, so I looked back on Yelp reviews and sure enough just 2 days prior there was a review saying that they brought their own wine.  Naturally I called back to confirm.  Same guy - \"Uuummmmm, well, I don't know.  Wait hold on.\".  He passed on the phone to someone else.  I, very nicely and politely said \"Hi\" and got cut off by a very RUDE \"Yeah, do you have a question because we're really busy right now..\"  What the..!

We had the Cumin Lamb on our first visit, but it was really a plate full of sauteed onions and 4 meager pieces of lamb.  Good flavor though.

He was like \"well, both are good...it depends on what you want.\"  Really?  That's your response??  Seriously?  Anyway, we went with the Corned Beef.

I only realized later that the sign of the location said \"Lung Shan Restaurant\" and that Mission Chinese was actually located inside...\n\nThe vibe there really stood out to me as more Chinese-American as opposed to a traditional Chinese restaurant with cut outs of a Mickey Mouse and Michael Jordon and also some random Christmas lights hanging around. \n\nWe ended up ordering the lamb dumplings, the famous chongqing chicken wings, and a salt cod rice for the each of us. The lamb dumplings were delicious, but considering the size of each dumpling and the amount of them (5) for $9, it wasn't really worth the price point.  I could literally smell how spicy the chicken wings were and each of my friends was even afraid to eat it. However, trying it, it was a good amount of spice. I expected the wings to be a lot more oily considering it was a Chinese restaurant, but the chicken was cooked very evenly with the dry spice rub.\n\nThe salt cod rice was probably the best bang for your buck here. For $13, the amount was pretty wild. There was so MUCH RICE. I actually expected pieces of salt cod in the fried rice, but I feel they mixed it in when cooking the rice so the rice had a salt cod taste to it otherwise it was just eggs and Chinese sausage.

We agreed we would go to Mission Chinese, a recommendation from his brother. When I first saw the place, I was confused as to why the sign doesn't say \"Mission Chinese Food\" but \"Lung Shan Restaurant.\" And then I saw the sticker with the Mission Chinese Food rickshaw on the window of the restaurant and felt that it was oddly familiar...\n\nOkay, so this place's twin sister in New York was featured in Anthony Bourdain's show \"The Layover.\" I immediately got excited because I adore Anthony Bourdain and have so far loved everything he recommended. This place is... very different. There is a huge Chinese paper dragon that hangs on the ceiling throughout the place while EDM-y music blasts away. The place was mostly dark with a lot of red-ish LEDs and green laser lights, so if your concealer isn't working to cover up your pimple, don't worry, because nobody will see it in this place. The menu items were weird but I was open to trying something new. The price of the dishes was pretty high up there, but I didn't mind spending it to get a different experience. Or so I thought...\n\nOur party ordered Chongqing Chicken Wings, Kung Pao Pastrami, Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice cakes, and Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries (if I'm not mistaken). The portion sizes were not that big for the price - definitely not family-size. Each of the plates are individual-sized and rice is not included in the price. Since the prices were already pretty expensive, we didn't order any sides and only ordered water for drinks. Now for individual dishes...\n\nLet me start with the Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries. Yeah, so I thought each of those things would come seaparately - like it's 1 Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito, an 1 Cod Fried Rice, and a bowl of fries. At around ~$13, I thought it was a steal! Nope. EVERYTHING is in ONE burrito. The burrito was okay. I went there 2 weeks ago and already forgot, so not that memorable, but I remember it being okay.\n\nMoving on to the Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes. Very greasy. Very salty. But tasty. Worth the price? At $16, I don't think so. The rice cakes are cut into little disks and the bacon cut into little squares. The bacon was very flavorful while the rice cakes were almost devoid of flavor except for the outside, so it balances the aggressiveness of the bacon flavor. But I felt that something was missing - the rice cakes were too bland. Like eerily bland on the inside. Other than that, it's an okay dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami. $16. Very Salty. It's also pretty good, but bite after bite, the saltiness will overthrow the balance of the taste.\n\nNow moving on to a diamond in the rough for this restaurant and the redeemer of my whole visit. Now, I like spicy food, but anything that will inflame body parts other than my tongue, I'm opposed to. The Chongqing Chicken Wings changed my mind. In the first bite, it was okay. Slightly spicy to the tip of the tongue. But a true feature of an excellent spicy savory food is the build of the spice. Yes, what I meant is that it will get spicier with every bite. This chicken does just that. The salt levels were on point, the sweetness is there, the spice builds to the point where I didn't realize that my mouth was going slightly numb. And the numbing feeling is surprisingly very fitting to the whole experience. It truly is sublime.\n\nAm I glad I went here? Yes. Would I go back here again? Probably not.

Most actually surprised me and appreciated the culture and the food... but our next door eaters looked at their salted cod fried rice... and without even tasting it, started dousing it with soy sauce. This is a cardinal sin in my book for chinese food. I kind of wish the restaurant would just hide the soy sauce and only have vineagar, lao gan ma and maybe spicy mustard so that it would avoid any situation like what I had just witnessed.

If the reality beats expectations, then it can be a glorious experience.  Over time and through additional experiences, you reach a kind of equilibrium.  I call it the realm of the \"old standby\", where although you may not be overly excited by the 10th visit, you are nevertheless never disappointed, and always leave happy.\n\nThen there's the other side, where expectations are so blown out of proportion, there is absolutely no way that reality can ever meet, let alone exceed, that level of anticipation and excitement.  This is quite simply not fair to the diner, or to the chef who may have had a completely different philosophy as to what his/her restaurant was all about.  In this era of fast media, instant gratification, and yes...user developed reviews (Yelp, I'm talking about you), we are all guilty of participating in, and exacerbating the situation.  Of this, I am also guilty.\n\nChef Bowein started Mission Chinese, from my understanding, to turn the traditional Chinese restaurant theme on its head...but do it tongue in cheek, or with a wink and a smile.  What can be more subversive than taking over a Chinese dive restaurant, giving it a secret name, that's not so secret, and meld Sichuan methodology and spices with non-Chinese ingredients like pastrami...yet give diners a real taste of what Sichuan food is really like.  Wow....my head just exploded thinking about it...\n\n...and that's the problem.  Already the expectations of being surprised or even shocked, it's really unachievable.\n\nI know that in the beginning, this all must have been subversive, if not revolutionary, if not for the fact that, especially in the Bay Area, a good chunk of us have had authentic Sichuan cuisine (or Hunan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, etc.) so the particular riff on flavors has a familiarity to it that doesn't scream \"revolutionary\".  Notwithstanding that, I guess the intent was that the way it is all put together, and the \"atmospherics\" of the dining experience would give it a little cultural kick.  But I'm sure those aspects get enhanced by the 6th Tsingtao.\n\nTrust me, I like dives, but a little more light, and cleaner path to the restrooms, let alone cleaner restrooms, wouldn't hurt the dining experience or the cultural milieu.\n\nSo what's the bottom line:  Mapo Tofu:  has that characteristic tongue numbing of Sichuan peppercorns, but otherwise, is not surprising or revolutionary.  The Smashed Cucumbers in Garlic Sauce was surprisingly bland, with hardly a hint of garlic.  The Chongqing Chicken Wings were good...would go great with a couple of beers, but was also on the mild side for my taste (after all, this is Sichuan cooking we're talking about...this is spicy wings we're talking about).\n\nThe Kung Pao Pastrami was spicy, but exceedingly salty.  Being that pastrami is brined to begin with, careful salt control is a must.  It must have been missing on my visit.  The same went for the braised beef noodle soup...which was so salty, we had to add about a 1/2 glass of water to the soup...and ask anyone who knows me....I'm not gentle with my seasoning.\n\nI don't know what to say other than disappointed.  But I'm not sure I have the restaurant to blame or the concept itself.  The fact is, Chef Bowein has blown-up, to use a new media phrase, and there's no going back....not even to the nascent days of Mission Chinese's opening.  Whatever was there in the beginning has now been lost in the morass of expectations, and you can't ever get that back.  On the other hand, had this been a restaurant opening in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California, I don't think Anthony Bourdain would have come calling.  So you got to take what you can take and run with it.  More power to you.\n\nPut it in the Mission, however, call it by a name that isn't really its name, and invite the Mission hipsters to eat there, and you have a cultural phenomena.  I get that....I respect that....but that doesn't mean disappointment can't happen.\n\nI'm hoping Chef comes back...does a little tinkering....and doesn't forget that in this new media world, expectations bring you up, and can make you come crashing down.\n\nAnd a few more light bulbs can't hurt.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-04-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Some misses:\n\nChongqing Chicken Wings - "], "author": "Catherine A.", "review": "It was my turn to pick the monthly dinner club resto last night and this was my choice (first timer).

Without a doubt this was probably one of the more unique experiences I've had at a restaurant. \n\nThe mere thought of a Chinese restaurant in the heavily Mexican district of San Francisco with Hipster waitresses blasting (awesome) folky music, might turn away a couple of Chinese food purists. \n\nBut who cares about them anyways? \n\nWe waited about an hour outside to get a seat for 3, which I've heard is pretty typical for MC. \n\nSo overall, I think it's a pretty great place for a date if you're with someone that's a relatively adventurous eater. Read: DON'T TAKE SOMEONE WITH A WEAK STOMACH YO!\n\nWhat we ordered:\nRed Braised Pork Belly (Fatty awesomeness)\nSalt Cod Fried Rice (Best I've had in a long time)\nEgg-Egg Noodles (Gingery and crazy good)\nThrice cooked bacon (Spicy, but delicious)\nChongqing Chicken Wings (DAFUQ!?!?!)\nMaPo Tofu (I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE)\n\nSo we started off with the Red Braised pork belly. If you're adverse to fat or have existing heart conditions, it may be wise to stay away from this. If not, this is melt-in-your mouth, party in your pants awesomeness. I've had better at traditional chinese places, but this is a pretty well done dish. Good to share with a few people. The Salt cod fried rice was done perfectly. Not too stinky and salty from the salt cod, a really great balance of scallion, eggs, chinese sausage. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The egg-egg noodles took me by surprise. They give you a raw egg yolk to mix in with the egg noodles, which gives it a richer, creamy texture. The dish is heavily gingered, but they do it in a way that is really successful. The thrice cooked bacon with Korean rice cakes was probably my second favorite dish. The bacon was salty, a little crispy and so well done. The addition of the rice cakes was a perfect vehicle for the spiciness of the dish. It's exactly what I needed. \n\nAnd now we enter the second half of the review, which deserves a name of it's own: \n\nWELCOME TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL. \n\nChongqing Chicken Wings. No dish has ever left such a lasting impression on me, maybe in my life. It lasted the entire rest of the meal, the rest of the night, and the following morning. This dish is not for the light of heart, the light of spice, and the light of HOLY BALLS WHY!? These wings are pretty heavy in Chinese 5 spice, which can be a little off-putting for those that aren't used to it. When you bite into them, you'll notice that they're well fried, and incredibly fragrant. Then your lips start to tingle. Then your mouth goes numb. The wings are coated with Chinese numbing spice, better (or maybe not) known as Sichuan flower peppers. It's an incredibly intense experience and I don't know if I've ever had my face literally go numb from spice. On the plus side, the wings are an incredibly flavor enhancer. Eating the noodles, the thrice cooked bacon, and the salt cod fried rice directly after eating the wings, made each food even more amazing. It was absolutely remarkable, it was like we were eating three completely different dishes. \n\nThen came the Mapo tofu. Now, I am a student of spice. I grew up with a father who loved to cook Sichuan style and grew his own Thai hot peppers. This Mapo wasn't the best I've ever had, but it's definitely worth giving a try. It's a little salty, so I suggest having some white rice around to help balance out the saltiness and spice of the dish. Maybe it was because of the Devil wings we just ate, but on medium spiciness, we were dripping in sweat, which in my case was spreading the spiciness across my face and thereby producing a numbing sensation. What the mapo lacks in balance of salt and spice, it makes up for in flavor. It's a pretty fragrant mapo dish and uses chunks of pork shoulder which fall apart in your mouth. I might get this again, but probably without the chicken wings. \n\nOverall, I give Mission Chinese a 4/5 because I would definitely go back, I would probably order most of the things I got again, but there are ton of really great items on the menu that I really want to try. The wait staff is pretty attentive and friendly. It certainly will be a while before I forget this experience. Damn you Chongqing Chicken wings.

I rounded up 8 close friends who are as down to devour whatever lands in front of them as I am, and we set off on our \"Mission\" to the Mission to try out this spot.\n\nWe arrived to find a line outside the red glowing doorway, and we could just barely make out the sounds of the EDM/Dance/Trance soundtrack playing inside. The smells coming from inside were so ta filling, and my excitement grew with each sweep of the breeze that carried new aromas right to my nostrils. I couldn't wait for our new to be called, and just as I started to wonder when we'd get in, our table was called! \n\nId finally made it and I felt like I was entering hallowed ground as I passed through the doorway into the warm, dark and humid dining room, illuminated by glowing red lights and guarded by a giant golden Chinese dragon overhead. At first I was bothered by the temperature, wondering if id be able to enjoy my meal, but that quickly faded as I began to peruse the menu. The dishes here are like nothing you've seen before, bringing together traditional Chinese ingredients in some very inspired and non-traditional ways. \n\nAs a crew that likes to eat and drink, we had about 12-14 dishes on the table for the 9 diners, and by the end of it all, the carnage was something to behold. We ordered the Mongolian Long beans, stir fried with dried Asian chiles, Serrano chiles and chile paste, the Tiki Pork Belly exterior crisped to perfection and complimented by the unctuous and meaty interior and sweet sauce, 3X Bacon with Rice Cakes and Bitter Melon, Tiger Salad, Squid Ink Noodles, Cod Fried Rice, Sour Chili Chicken, Explosively spicy wings and more!\n\nMy favorite bit was the 3X Bacon, thin slices of lightly smoked pork belly served with chewy Chinese rice cakes and thinly sliced bitter melon, was an incredible bite of food. The bacon was thin but meaty with a light charcoal/hardwood smoked flavor that played really well with the bitterness of the bitter melon and spicy/savory/salty sauce and the rice cake added the perfect texture. I couldn't stop eating this combo throughout the meal. \n\nThe surprise of the night was the Tiger Salad. Described as simple and light by our server, this dish arrived and had us all confused. On a long plate stood three bundles of lightly dressed fresh herbs, ties together by wide pieces of chow fun rice noodles. They were roughly 3-4\" tall! The freshness of the salad was the perfect contrast to the rich and spicy dishes on the table, and I would suggest this as something anyone who comes should order.\n\nThe star of the night was the squid ink noodles, which are served with cumin spiced and charred lamb, harissa, a few fresh greens and a tangy yogurt sauce. As with a lot of Asian food, texture is important and the noodles added that beautifully. The ground lamb was delicate and delicious, providing a warm spice from the cumin, which combined nicely with a light heat from the Harissa. The surprise ingredient was the yogurt sauce, which rounded out and carried all of the flavors across your palate, bringing you back for more.  These are clearly freshly made noodles, and taking this to go would ruin their perfectly chewy texture, which is why it's only available dine in, and well worth waiting for!\n\nBite after bite of this spicy fare had me mopping my brow and downing glass after glass of reasonably priced, moderately cold, sake, which in turn had me focused on the next bite and forgetting about the warmth in the room.

I've been wanting to try Mission Chinese Food for so long, seeing all of the reviews and hearing all the praise heaped on them made me that much more hopeful for a great meal.  It's disappointing that it didn't happen, but I could see it being better a second time around...\n\n**Apologies for the poor photo quality...didn't want to annoy people with the flash.\n\n- TEA-SMOKED EEL - Fresh Rice Noodle, Chinese Celery, Salted Plum Hoisin, Braised Pork, Cognac Soy...$9\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#JmyWO6-U2P4IdlPTf3WgNQ)\nIt sounded so good on the menu, but this one did the least for me.  The eel wasn't bad, but the hoisin and soy dominated the dish with a salty flavor.

The blend of flavors was nice, but the cuts of pork belly left me wanting.  One piece was all meat and the other was all fat.\n\n- KUNG PAO PASTRAMI - Explosive Chili, Celery, Potato, Sweet Peppers, and Roasted Peanut...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#OiaERJDipb2u5Ku9mOsr2g)\nI don't usually get \"Kung Pao\" dishes, but this one was pretty good.  I really liked how the dish had a slight kick and that the pieces of pastrami were so meaty.  If it wasn't as salty as it was, this would have been a terrific dish.\n\n- SALT COD FRIED RICE - Mackerel Confit, Chinese Sausage, Lettuce, Egg...$11\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#xz7o_XqXfm7cY94Rp--e5Q)\nEven though I wish they left out the cilantro (not a fan), it was a solid dish for the most part.  The dish was well seasoned and the salt cod added just the right amount of salty/fishy flavor.\n\n- MONGOLIAN LONG BEANS - with Xinjiang Spices, Horseradish, and Chili Oil...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#oRiu_GaiMEyx4tzL-AKhJg)\nNot bad, but not great.  Although there was nothing wrong with the dish, it was hard for me to get excited because I just had a similar version at Hawker Fare in Oakland right before this one that tasted much better.\n\n- SMOKED BEEF BRISKEY NOODLE SOUP - Cheung Fun, Mire Pork, Bok Choy, Cardamom Broth...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#7yebO14nZqr7UjkshUY44Q)\nLike the long beans, I was rather indifferent on this one.  The broth was light yet flavorful and the bowl was filled with generous amount of goodies.  However, again on a personal level, it was hard for me to get passed the cilantro.\n\n(If it wasn't clear already, I should note that I have a serious distaste for cilantro.  So in fairness, given that it was used in nearly every dish we had, it was hard for me to really fall for any particular dish regardless of how much I tried to set my bias aside.)\n\nOverall, I'd give the food THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of the service.  Although our server was attentive enough, she seemed to cop a bit of an attitude with one of my friends as we were putting in our order.  Still, I definitely want to come back to give their food another chance.\n\n\"Let me know when you want to go again - I'll show you the right things to get.\"\n\nNo pressure buddy, no pressure.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-06-27"}, {"excerpts": ["The tiki pork belly was good, but the portion seemed a little small.

Even though there was a line, we took a leap of faith and put our name on the list. We went down the street to Boba Guys, came back, waited a bit more and got seated. We weren't in a rush, so we didn't mind the wait.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE:\nAt night, it's dimly lit with red lights.

But you really just have to come into this with an open mind and know that it's a different, modern take. I can see the less traditional, fusion elements and the influences from other cuisines melded in. Which created some confusion for my palette, but was still weirdly interesting. We got the following:\n\n*Tiki Pork Belly: SOLID! Two hearty portions that were tender and THAT SAUCE. I loved it, sweet and complimentary to the saltiness of the pork. I wanted to slather it on the pork and rice. \n\n*Cherry Glazed Porky Ribs: For me, wasn't a highlight of the meal, but a very big portion for just two people to share. \n\n*Squid Ink Noodles: This was one of the memorable dishes for me. I love noodles so this was a cool take, taste wise and visually. There's this yogurt sauce that feels very mediterranean and then the meat tasted reminiscent of chorizo, so it felt Spanish. Weird combination, but tasted well together. \n\nWeirdly intrigued and curious about the other dishes, so I'm inclined for another visit. All in all, a solid experience.

A healthy dose of hoisin sauce is poured to the side to provide a base for all of these ingredients to come together. Simply outstanding. \n\nThe Sichuan pickles ($4) are a variation of kimchi and offer a fiery but palate cleansing dish throughout the meal. Served with giant roasted peanuts and pepper flakes, an unusual variation of an Asian staple. \n\nThe Kung pao pastrami ($12) is a classic stir fry dish in that it is a pile of pastrami and vegetables on a plate. However, the thick pieces of salty pastrami easily extract the sweet celery and red pepper from the pile. Peanuts sprinkled atop provide a little crunch. \n\nThe combination fried rice ($15) is light on oil, heavy on fresh vegetables - cilantro, onion, red pepper, scallions - light pork and a size able dollop of crab meat atop.

At my first visit over a year ago, the food was gratuitous, rich and just a little too salty - but over all really tasty. 2nd time I took my parents, bad mistake, as two 1st generation Chinese immigrants were appalled by what they considered a bastardization of their home cuisine. Though the food was tasty, it even saltier than the first time, to the point where we didn't finish a lot of the food. I'd give that visit 3 stars because the food was still palatable. \n\nBut these two visits are not why Mission Chinese is getting one star from me. Last night, I took some friends visiting here to enjoy some hip, fun chinese food and half the dishes were just seriously inedible even horrifying. \n\nWe got the Tiki Pork belly, which is always a safe bet at Mission Chinese, it's hard to go wrong with deep friend pork belly. It was solid, but as always a little too salty. You can't NOT skimp on white rice and water here, you will be punished. \n\nThen the Mongolian Long beans, another edible dish, it wasn't great but again it's nearly impossible to screw up. \n\nNext we got to the Sesame chicken, by this time everyone's tastebuds were experiencing some serious fatigue. Drinking water was such a good relief that it almost hurt. Sesame chicken was not noteworthy - I almost forgot we had eaten it. Thick crust, over cooked, barely any meat... again primary flavors: salt and sugar.\n\nBut the last two dishes are why I woke up with my throat swollen this morning, what made a pretty mediocre meal unforgettably bad, why I've probably lost dinner-picking rights among my friends and why I will never go back to Mission Chinese again. \n\nWe got the Vegan Dan-Dan Mein - again nearly impossible to screw up. The noodles came out swimming in this thick sauce, unlike any Dan Dan mein I've ever seen, more like noodle cornstarch soup. There was a hint something weird, herbal, tangy - almost a mix between lemon grass and pinesol that was in the noodles... not only do those two flavors NOT mix with food in general, they especially clash with the Ma La (numbing spice) that laced the Dan-dan mein. That combined with what must have been 500g of salt in this small bowl, the four of us couldn't get through 1/4th of the small bowl of noodles.\n\nFinally, the unforgettable Ma Po Tofu. I had nightmares about this. How the F*(#K do you screw up Ma Po Tofu that badly? Texturally the dish was okay and that's where the good things ended. There was Ma La again, which I expect to be in a good Ma Po, but then you get slammed with the salt and there's this indescribable chemical burning pain. The only thing I can compare it to is Potassium bitartrate filling the inside of your mouth. Don't ask me how I know but that's the closest feeling there is - if you want to try for yourself they sell Potassium bitartrate under the name Cream of Tartar in most grocery stores (have 911 on the ready) OR you could just try some of Mission Chinese's Ma Po Tofu for 10X the cost. At least you'll have a pretty red dragon gracing the saddest culinary atrocity in your life. \n\nSeriously we are not picky eaters, I'm Chinese and I clear my plates but we could not eat more than 3 small spoonfuls of the Ma Po Tofu. I just kept diluting that chemical sludge with more and more white rice until I realized I was just eating white rice at that point to try to end the pain. I want to emphasize that I grew up with Chinese peppers and Sichuan food, this was not the burning of chilies or Ma La... this was something else, much more sinister. Water hurt, my tongue hurts this morning, my throat is nearly swollen shut. How was this even legal?

For someone who is such a fan of San Francisco's culinary heaven, I decided to finally check Mission Chinese Food off the list. All day I had been anxiously waiting for 5pm to roll around the corner. I had spent some time earlier that afternoon reading the menu and found myself in a dilemma -- I had no idea what I was going to order. It all sounded so wonderful. I wanted to try it all!\n\nWe got there right when they opened and managed to grab a table immediately. Took another quick glance at the menu and we placed our order. We all knew we had to try to salt cod fried rice. It's the only thing I ever here anyone talk about it. When it got to the table we all just kind of stared at it. We were a bit confused as we saw zero salt cod in this \"godly\" dish.\n\n\"Maybe it's mixed it there somewhere?\" I took my chopsticks and stirred the fried rice around.\n\nNo salt cod.\n\n\"Well...does it at least taste salty?\" It didn't. No salt cod or hints of the mackerel confit. Something that should pack a punch with flavor. We sat there for a bit longer and looked through some photos of this dish on yelp and other sources which clearly showed that salt cod had been present in this dish once upon a time.\n\nI had never been served a dish before that left me so puzzled.\n\nWe waved down the waitress and asked her if this was indeed the \"Salt Cod\" Fried Rice or if we were given the wrong dish. She was quick to reply in the most unfriendly, condescending way and said this dish doesn't actually have pieces of salt cod in it and walked away. No care in the world about our experience at a restaurant that is supposedly one of the most important restaurants in America. \n\nThen in walks Danny Bowien himself. I glanced at him in disbelief and stared down at the \"salt cod\" fried rice, moving the rice to the edges of my plate as I'm still searching for this non-existent fish. As he walked by our table, a part of me so badly wanted to introduce myself and ask him to take a bite of this dish and see if he thought this was acceptable. Because I think he would say otherwise. \n\nWe also ordered the tea smoked eel, savory egg custard, and the tiki pork belly. The pork belly was truly the only thing I enjoyed.\n\nI just wish I had some salt cod in my salt cod fried rice. And maybe a server that actually cared.\n\nFarewell, Mission Chinese Food.

My friend was kind enough to get take out for us.  Unfortunately, certain appealing dishes were available only for in restaurant dining (like a squid ink pasta!)\n\nGRANDMA'S SPICY LAMB DUMPLINGS: Slightly gamey, with a kick from chili oil; I could have done without the peanuts but really liked the pickles. \n\nTEA SMOKED EEL: Reminded me of the dim sum \"chang fen,\" but instead of shrimp or beef, it was smoked eel.  The eel itself was smoky and rich.  The Chinese celery added a nice crunch, but the celery was a little too pungent for the dish.  You definitely need to dip it in the soy sauce.  \n\nTIKI PORK BELLY: Kind of fusion-ish with the pineapple, coconut, and mandarin orange - like a tropical pork belly, with a little tiki umbrella and all. \n \nCHONGQING CHICKEN WINGS: Tons of red chilis on top, as well as chili oil - pretty explosive as they say.  The crispy beef tripe may actually be even better than the wings.  The spiciness can be numbing.\n\nSALT COD FRIED RICE:  Disappointing! I think this dish made it on the 7x7 list.  You can't really go wrong when you combine salted fish, chinese sausage, egg, and scallion with white rice.. unless there's essentially NO cod in the dish.  I had to add salt and chili sauce for more flavor.  I did like the jalapeno in it.\n\nKUNG PAO PASTRAMI: Tons of flavor and textures, nice kick, probably my favorite stir fry.  Definitely on the greasy side.  \n\nCUMIN LAMB RIBS: Done well, hickory smoked, and the accompaniments went well on the rice.  \n\nTHRICE COOKED BACON AND RICE CAKES: Stir fried rice cakes coated in bacon fat.  The bacon wasn't as strong as I expected, and it had lots of Szechuan pepper, but I actually hoped for more salt in this dish, too. \n\nMONGOLIAN LONG BEANS: Good flavor, very oily, lots of spices, didn't taste the horseradish.  \n\nMARKET GREENS: Kind of expensive ($12) for some stir fried baby bok choy, but it was the lightest dish of all, and I really needed vegetables not coated in oil.\n\nOverall, I was expecting for more flavor rather than just pure spiciness.  While I appreciate the creativity like with the kung pao pastrami, I thought they under-performed on more classic, signature dishes like the fried rice.   I think they also use less sugar than the average Chinese restaurant in SF; though they use just as much grease.   It's fun to try the various dishes, so it's better to have more people.

I guess this place has some destination value, and I'd visit again if I had the chance.\n\nI came for a late dinner on a Friday night with a party of three.  We put our name down and waited outside in the mild San Francisco cold.  The wait was bearable - I think it was something like 20 minutes, extended because our third took his time showing up.  Once we were in, we got a moderately shitty table in one of the two glass-walled corner pockets adjacent to the doorway.  I sat against a window, presenting my back to the street.  The ambiance was kind of fun.  The restaurant was dim, tiny, and very busy.  The servers were pierced and Mission hip, as was much of the crowd.  Service was decent, fast and available.  We weren't forgotten.\n\nThe food was excellent.  We ate family style and ordered four dishes for three people.  It was a lot of food, which we only came close to finishing because of my MVP vacation appetite.  My favorite dish was the salt cod fried rice, which came with mackerel confit, Chinese sausage, lettuce, and egg.  It was fluffy and wonderful, delightfully salty, with bits of fish and sausage to add their meaty substance.  I also loved the thrice cooked bacon.  It was hefty with some great chew, and it was severely smokey in a way that I rather enjoyed.  One of my friends said it tasted like he was smoking a cigarette, but I don't think he meant that in a bad way.  The bacon came with bitter melon, tofu skin, chili oil, and plenty of floppy, supple Shanghainese rice cakes that moderated some of that strong flavor.  The tiki pork belly was another good dose of pig, a sweet one to counteract all the salt and smoke.  The pork belly was cooked soft and fatty with a soy caramel, and it came with mandarin orange, pickled pineapple, shaved coconut, and macadamia nuts.  The only overtly spicy dish we ordered was the Mongolian long beans.  These were quite spicy, but very enjoyable as a side.  They were a little bit doused in chili oil, but I liked the firm texture and the mix of Xinjiang spices and horseradish really delivered a kick.\n\nI washed down this feast with a $4 21st Amendment IPA, which hit the spot.  I think I spent a little under $40 on this meal, which is a lot for Chinese food, not too much for a destination dinner.

The only thing is, we didn't have a private table and had to share it with other people. The couple that sat next to us were obviously on a date and I could hear their conversation. I was thinking, I hope the guy doesn't date that girl again lmao! She wasn't good for him I thought coz she acted a little spoiled and privileged. Anyway, back to the restaurant. Service was good too and they were attentive, although we had to cram the dishes so it doesn't overlap on the couple's space next to us! Parking was a little hard to find when we were there.

We agreed we would go to Mission Chinese, a recommendation from his brother. When I first saw the place, I was confused as to why the sign doesn't say \"Mission Chinese Food\" but \"Lung Shan Restaurant.\" And then I saw the sticker with the Mission Chinese Food rickshaw on the window of the restaurant and felt that it was oddly familiar...\n\nOkay, so this place's twin sister in New York was featured in Anthony Bourdain's show \"The Layover.\" I immediately got excited because I adore Anthony Bourdain and have so far loved everything he recommended. This place is... very different. There is a huge Chinese paper dragon that hangs on the ceiling throughout the place while EDM-y music blasts away. The place was mostly dark with a lot of red-ish LEDs and green laser lights, so if your concealer isn't working to cover up your pimple, don't worry, because nobody will see it in this place. The menu items were weird but I was open to trying something new. The price of the dishes was pretty high up there, but I didn't mind spending it to get a different experience. Or so I thought...\n\nOur party ordered Chongqing Chicken Wings, Kung Pao Pastrami, Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice cakes, and Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries (if I'm not mistaken). The portion sizes were not that big for the price - definitely not family-size. Each of the plates are individual-sized and rice is not included in the price. Since the prices were already pretty expensive, we didn't order any sides and only ordered water for drinks. Now for individual dishes...\n\nLet me start with the Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries. Yeah, so I thought each of those things would come seaparately - like it's 1 Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito, an 1 Cod Fried Rice, and a bowl of fries. At around ~$13, I thought it was a steal! Nope. EVERYTHING is in ONE burrito. The burrito was okay. I went there 2 weeks ago and already forgot, so not that memorable, but I remember it being okay.\n\nMoving on to the Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes. Very greasy. Very salty. But tasty. Worth the price? At $16, I don't think so. The rice cakes are cut into little disks and the bacon cut into little squares. The bacon was very flavorful while the rice cakes were almost devoid of flavor except for the outside, so it balances the aggressiveness of the bacon flavor. But I felt that something was missing - the rice cakes were too bland. Like eerily bland on the inside. Other than that, it's an okay dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami. $16. Very Salty. It's also pretty good, but bite after bite, the saltiness will overthrow the balance of the taste.\n\nNow moving on to a diamond in the rough for this restaurant and the redeemer of my whole visit. Now, I like spicy food, but anything that will inflame body parts other than my tongue, I'm opposed to. The Chongqing Chicken Wings changed my mind. In the first bite, it was okay. Slightly spicy to the tip of the tongue. But a true feature of an excellent spicy savory food is the build of the spice. Yes, what I meant is that it will get spicier with every bite. This chicken does just that. The salt levels were on point, the sweetness is there, the spice builds to the point where I didn't realize that my mouth was going slightly numb. And the numbing feeling is surprisingly very fitting to the whole experience. It truly is sublime.\n\nAm I glad I went here? Yes. Would I go back here again? Probably not. As good as the chicken wings were, it was a once-in-a-blue-moon experience that is better savored when it's not often repeated. Everything else was meh and talking over the music is hard.

I rounded up 8 close friends who are as down to devour whatever lands in front of them as I am, and we set off on our \"Mission\" to the Mission to try out this spot.\n\nWe arrived to find a line outside the red glowing doorway, and we could just barely make out the sounds of the EDM/Dance/Trance soundtrack playing inside. The smells coming from inside were so ta filling, and my excitement grew with each sweep of the breeze that carried new aromas right to my nostrils. I couldn't wait for our new to be called, and just as I started to wonder when we'd get in, our table was called! \n\nId finally made it and I felt like I was entering hallowed ground as I passed through the doorway into the warm, dark and humid dining room, illuminated by glowing red lights and guarded by a giant golden Chinese dragon overhead. At first I was bothered by the temperature, wondering if id be able to enjoy my meal, but that quickly faded as I began to peruse the menu. The dishes here are like nothing you've seen before, bringing together traditional Chinese ingredients in some very inspired and non-traditional ways. \n\nAs a crew that likes to eat and drink, we had about 12-14 dishes on the table for the 9 diners, and by the end of it all, the carnage was something to behold. We ordered the Mongolian Long beans, stir fried with dried Asian chiles, Serrano chiles and chile paste, the Tiki Pork Belly exterior crisped to perfection and complimented by the unctuous and meaty interior and sweet sauce, 3X Bacon with Rice Cakes and Bitter Melon, Tiger Salad, Squid Ink Noodles, Cod Fried Rice, Sour Chili Chicken, Explosively spicy wings and more!\n\nMy favorite bit was the 3X Bacon, thin slices of lightly smoked pork belly served with chewy Chinese rice cakes and thinly sliced bitter melon, was an incredible bite of food. The bacon was thin but meaty with a light charcoal/hardwood smoked flavor that played really well with the bitterness of the bitter melon and spicy/savory/salty sauce and the rice cake added the perfect texture. I couldn't stop eating this combo throughout the meal. \n\nThe surprise of the night was the Tiger Salad. Described as simple and light by our server, this dish arrived and had us all confused. On a long plate stood three bundles of lightly dressed fresh herbs, ties together by wide pieces of chow fun rice noodles. They were roughly 3-4\" tall! The freshness of the salad was the perfect contrast to the rich and spicy dishes on the table, and I would suggest this as something anyone who comes should order.\n\nThe star of the night was the squid ink noodles, which are served with cumin spiced and charred lamb, harissa, a few fresh greens and a tangy yogurt sauce. As with a lot of Asian food, texture is important and the noodles added that beautifully. The ground lamb was delicate and delicious, providing a warm spice from the cumin, which combined nicely with a light heat from the Harissa. The surprise ingredient was the yogurt sauce, which rounded out and carried all of the flavors across your palate, bringing you back for more.  These are clearly freshly made noodles, and taking this to go would ruin their perfectly chewy texture, which is why it's only available dine in, and well worth waiting for!\n\nBite after bite of this spicy fare had me mopping my brow and downing glass after glass of reasonably priced, moderately cold, sake, which in turn had me focused on the next bite and forgetting about the warmth in the room. We passed dishes for what seemed like an enjoyable eternity, and when we examined our efforts, we all sat back satiated and smiling knowing Mission Chinese has left us much more to explore in a future visit. Tingly lamb face noodle soup, Kung Pao Pastrami, and so much more!\n\nOn a scale of one to hype, this place is all that and a bag of fried wontons!

Like unbearable. If you didn't get there at 5pm to put your name down, you weren't gonna get a chance to eat until 11pm type deal. I am so pumped that was not the same experience here!\n\nOk the deal: no reservations, first come, first serve and your party must be present to be seated. You leave your name on a pad and you either wait or leave and if your name is called while you have taken reprieve at a local bar, you can come back let them know and you'll be up next. It works. We arrived at about 7 on a Saturday night to a wait, came back at 9 and were easily seated.\n\nHip hop is always the best music you can play, especially when eating in a dark, kitschy Chinese restaurant. Yes, call me a hipster, call me whatever you like, but I'm into the vibe. Service suits the restaurant. My water glass was always full, my food came out quickly and we exchanged pleasantries. What else are you looking for?\n\nNow the food. I suggest going family style. All of the portions were large. There were 3 grown men and myself and this was more than enough food. Nothing was over oily, like Chinese food can tend to be. Lots of sodium, but again they didn't over do it and what do you expect? This is Chinese food!\n\n - Thrice cooked bacon - Salty, delicious and those flat slices of dough add this great texture. A nice side dish to share.\n- Pork dumplings - This is on the to-go menu, but they hooked it up. More gyoza than dumplings. They were good, but there's better out there. \n- Tea smoked eel - Funky. I liked it, but didn't love it. I wouldn't order again. The combo of ingredients didn't mesh as well as it could have. Definitely unique.\n- Kung Pao pastrami - Such a unique dish. Chunks of pastrami sauteed with potato, celery and peanuts with a hint of spice. Really great dish. A table favorite.\n- Schmaltz rice - chicken fat dressed rice with cucumber and a hint of hot sauce. I wouldn't order this as a main entree, but it went perfectly with the spiciness of the other dishes. Very subtle flavor, but so buttery and delicious. I loved this.\n- Spicy beef chow mein - My favorite with the rice.

The food is more fusion, and most of the people eating here are hipsters or non-Asians. I think initially that was a really big negative, since usually a sure sign of an ethnic restaurant being good is when _insert said ethnic group_ eats there. Like my brother said, \"I feel a little embarrassed to be the only Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant.\"\n\nBut if you set your expectations as coming to MCF to eat straight-up good food, not about coming to eat specifically Chinese food, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. That may be an understatement. \n\nMust gets:\n#1- Squid ink noodles. I guess they don't do to-go so it's not listed on their website menu. This dish was awesome. It's squid ink (thick) noodles with lamb, fennel, chickpeas, and onions. It also comes with a dipping sauce, which might have been some buttery lamb broth. I don't really care what it was, but if you're a big fan of lamb, you'll love this dish.\n\n#2- Thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes. Rice cakes with sweet tofu skin, pepper, and thrice cooked bacon. Really tasty, but the thrice cooked bacon was soft, not crispy, like I'd expect of something cooked thrice. Actually, it was kind of hard to distinguish between the bacon and the tofu skin in the dimly lit restaurant, since both were kind of soft and floppy.\n\n#3- Mongolian long beans. This is mandatory if you're one of those people that feel like you need a vegetable-heavy entree with every meal. It's spicy, but not burn-your-mouth-off spicy. It's a huge dish with lots of long beans, lots of other semi-edible vegetable parts, like ends of boy choy?

Sounds exciting with the fish, Chinese sausage, and egg, but at the end of the day, if you've had a fried rice, you've had this fried rice. Nothing about it stood out.

Plus, the beef was pretty tender.  \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/a6rw59q\n\nSpicy Green Bean - If you've read any of my reviews, you will know that I am not the huge lover of greens. But I did dig these.  The beans were cooked perfectly and then there was the heat.  There is nothing bland about this batch of beans.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/afsamo6\n\nSalt Cod Rice - This is another dish that worked against my own personal bias.  I've never been a huge salt cod fan.  But the flavor of the cod was restrained and the rice served as a great platform the dish.  It worked and I really enjoyed it.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ba3e8y4\n\nChicken Wings with peppers - I guess this is a Schezwan take on chicken wings.  These are wings buried under a bed of peppers.  They do pick up some heat but it is not too over the top.  I just cried little.  For me, this dish was good but certainly wouldn't make any of my top ten lists for chicken wings.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/bzme2np\n\nOverall, this is a fun and slightly adventurous dining experience.  There is a good energy to the place with lots of folks enjoying their food in a relatively cramped environment.  The food is good and trying some different things.

I call it the realm of the \"old standby\", where although you may not be overly excited by the 10th visit, you are nevertheless never disappointed, and always leave happy.\n\nThen there's the other side, where expectations are so blown out of proportion, there is absolutely no way that reality can ever meet, let alone exceed, that level of anticipation and excitement.  This is quite simply not fair to the diner, or to the chef who may have had a completely different philosophy as to what his/her restaurant was all about.  In this era of fast media, instant gratification, and yes...user developed reviews (Yelp, I'm talking about you), we are all guilty of participating in, and exacerbating the situation.  Of this, I am also guilty.\n\nChef Bowein started Mission Chinese, from my understanding, to turn the traditional Chinese restaurant theme on its head...but do it tongue in cheek, or with a wink and a smile.  What can be more subversive than taking over a Chinese dive restaurant, giving it a secret name, that's not so secret, and meld Sichuan methodology and spices with non-Chinese ingredients like pastrami...yet give diners a real taste of what Sichuan food is really like.  Wow....my head just exploded thinking about it...\n\n...and that's the problem.  Already the expectations of being surprised or even shocked, it's really unachievable.\n\nI know that in the beginning, this all must have been subversive, if not revolutionary, if not for the fact that, especially in the Bay Area, a good chunk of us have had authentic Sichuan cuisine (or Hunan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, etc.) so the particular riff on flavors has a familiarity to it that doesn't scream \"revolutionary\".  Notwithstanding that, I guess the intent was that the way it is all put together, and the \"atmospherics\" of the dining experience would give it a little cultural kick.  But I'm sure those aspects get enhanced by the 6th Tsingtao.\n\nTrust me, I like dives, but a little more light, and cleaner path to the restrooms, let alone cleaner restrooms, wouldn't hurt the dining experience or the cultural milieu.\n\nSo what's the bottom line:  Mapo Tofu:  has that characteristic tongue numbing of Sichuan peppercorns, but otherwise, is not surprising or revolutionary.  The Smashed Cucumbers in Garlic Sauce was surprisingly bland, with hardly a hint of garlic.  The Chongqing Chicken Wings were good...would go great with a couple of beers, but was also on the mild side for my taste (after all, this is Sichuan cooking we're talking about...this is spicy wings we're talking about).\n\nThe Kung Pao Pastrami was spicy, but exceedingly salty.  Being that pastrami is brined to begin with, careful salt control is a must.  It must have been missing on my visit.  The same went for the braised beef noodle soup...which was so salty, we had to add about a 1/2 glass of water to the soup...and ask anyone who knows me....I'm not gentle with my seasoning.\n\nI don't know what to say other than disappointed.  But I'm not sure I have the restaurant to blame or the concept itself.  The fact is, Chef Bowein has blown-up, to use a new media phrase, and there's no going back....not even to the nascent days of Mission Chinese's opening.  Whatever was there in the beginning has now been lost in the morass of expectations, and you can't ever get that back.  On the other hand, had this been a restaurant opening in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California, I don't think Anthony Bourdain would have come calling.  So you got to take what you can take and run with it.  More power to you.\n\nPut it in the Mission, however, call it by a name that isn't really its name, and invite the Mission hipsters to eat there, and you have a cultural phenomena.  I get that....I respect that....but that doesn't mean disappointment can't happen.\n\nI'm hoping Chef comes back...does a little tinkering....and doesn't forget that in this new media world, expectations bring you up, and can make you come crashing down.\n\nAnd a few more light bulbs can't hurt.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-04-03"}, {"excerpts": ["The kung pao pastrami is a nice riff on the chicken favorite, peppers again running the show and married with the fatty pastrami.\n", "The pickles are a sweet/sour flavor bomb, a nice segue between the entrees.\n", "I liked the succulence of the sliced peanut noodles, slippery and saucey.\n", "Call ahead and your food will f waiting in 25 minutes.

Even Panda Express does a better job than this barf food I had.... My friends and I had such high expectations for this place, and we were beyond disappointed after the first bite. How can a restaurant that's on the 7x7 list, featured in several magazines, and has 1000+ reviews on Yelp taste that bad, you ask? It's all the hype - and please, don't believe in it. \n\nMy friends and I came on a Friday night (silly us) and waited for about 30-45 minutes in the cold (super windy night) with people pestering us for money. From the first glance of the store-front, I was kind of skeptical of the place. It was very grungy - and my belief was confirmed when I went inside to use the restroom. The restroom was straight through the kitchen and out the door. It was where the garbage and recycling bins were located, and right next to the kitchen. My initial thoughts were, \"use the restroom as fast as possible because rats and cockroaches can come out any minute!\" I mean, I didn't see any.. but you can only wonder....\n\nI also hated the interior of the restaurant. It was super dark and uncomfortable. My party had to share this medium size round table with 2 other parties, which was kind of awkward. I meant, I'm from HK and I'm used to this whole sharing table concept. But cramming us altogether with so little breathing room is not okay. When the food came out, we could barely distinguish our dishes with other parties' dishes. Not only that, but the table soon ran out of space to even accommodate all our dishes. Ugh... However, the most annoying part of the meal was that my party literally sat under the speakers, and they were playing loud, obnoxious KMEL-like music... Really, at a \"Chinese\" restaurant?? You have got to be kidding me. \n\nOkay, the most important part of the review... the food....\n\n1. Char Siu Pig Ear Terrine\nWeird texture and taste. What grossed me out the most was the little pieces of hairs still stuck on the pig ears... Even with the limited lighting, I could see those hairs stick up. Who would serve customers food with animal hairs still on it?? That's just disgusting.\n\n2. Tea Smoked Eel\nThis was a cool concept, but just didn't work. It would have been okay with just the rice noodle, eel, and celery, but there was this fishy tasting minced paste thing that just tasted like barf. I literally felt nauseous immediately after eating that. It was just a weird taste.. I don't even know what it was. I read the menu, and it says that there was \"braised pork\" in it.. but it definitely didn't taste like pork to me.... \n\n3. Salt Cod Fried Rice\nProbably the only dish that was \"acceptable\", and only because it didn't deviate too much from the REAL salted fish and chicken fried rice Chinese people traditionally make. However, given the quality of the food, it still wasn't very good as it lacked in flavor. I've had way better fried rice at Panda Express... But I'm glad we ordered this...since this was the only dish that was edible lol\n\n4. Egg Egg Noodle\nCame with a raw egg, which I think ruined the entire dish. How can they ruin such a simple dish? I think it literally consisted of noodles, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, and the raw egg. But it was just disgusting. I can't pinpoint why (weird texture and taste?), but I could only take 2 bites before putting it down. \n\n5. Kung Pao Pastrami\nWere they trying to kill us with that overly salty pastrami?? I've never tasted anything THAT salty... My friends and I were even joking about how this should be called \"Morton Pastrami\" given the extreme saltiness of the dish. I had one bite of the pastrami and couldn't handle it. Though I enjoyed the peanuts.......?\n\nMy friends and I ate about half (or less) of each dish and didn't even bother to take the leftovers home. It was THAT bad. I mean, I felt bad for wasting food like that and considered giving it to homeless people, but I think it would do more harm for them than help... Where are they going to find water to wash down that disgustingly salty pastrami? Worst $70 bucks ever spent on food. The table next to us also left half their dishes untouched and didn't take them home either.. That's saying something.\n\nI should've known this place would be a disappointment given that there were no Asians waiting in line to try this place. This place is super \"Hipsterized\" and gives Chinese food a bad name. I feel sorry for people whose first experience with Chinese food is at Mission Chinese Food. If this was my first experience, I would probably hate Chinese food. If you want REAL Chinese food, go elsewhere, preferably somewhere in Chinatown, Richmond, or Sunset.. NOT the Mission, and definitely NOT Mission Chinese Food. \n\nThe only redeeming factor about this place is that they donate 75 cents per entree to SF Food Bank.

A few things to note here.\n\n- It's really quite good. The pastrami is smoky, tender, and slightly spicy. The fattier pieces melt in your mouth, and the edge pieces have a nice little bark on them, like barbecue.\n\n- Lots of vegetables -- red peppers, celery, and paper-thin potatoes, all lightly cooked to stay a bit crispy. I liked the meat-vegetable ratio; the pastrami would have overwhelmed the dish with salt and smoke if they'd used more. The potatoes were an unusual choice, but I've got to admit, it works.\n\n- It was light on the peanuts -- looking at pictures other people have uploaded here, they seem to be pretty inconsistent with the peanut dosage. I honestly don't remember getting any peanuts in my dish; maybe they just forgot.\n\n- No Sichuan peppercorns either, as far as I could tell. Pity; they would have worked well here.\n\n- I didn't think it was actively spicy, but the folks next to me ordered the same thing and gave up due to the spice. Not sure whether this was due to inconsistency in the kitchen, or I've just burnt off most of my taste buds.\n\n- A large pile of not-quite-kung-pao and a bowl of rice came to $14 or so.

Not that I don't like mushrooms, but I think the new recipe is not as good as the old one.\n(b) The last time I dined there, I found a RUBBER BAND in my fried rice. I am not kidding.

It's still worth going there once.\n\nService: I have had better luck getting take outs and delivery. Delivery has always been on-time (exactly 40-45 min), if not faster. Strangely, service at the actual restaurant appears to be worse. The place is ill-decorated, ill-lit, with awful music, mediocre service, and unforgivingly long wait times, should you decide to dine in.

Not \"Man vs Food\" level crazy hotness, but fierce enough that I won't be surprised to find a few unjust bad reviews based on that. There's no stars for you to tone down the spiciness level. Bottom line -- if you can't handle spiciness, order non-spicy food on the menu.\n\nDishes: here are my reviews for each dishes I've ordered\n\nMa Po Tofu --- GET IT! unless you can't eat pork, which would be a huge shame. it's a very thick, savory sauce filled with soft tofu and pork chunks.\n\nBraised watercress --- interesting blend with pumpkin, peanut, and beans. I would count this as fulfilling enough as a standalone vegetarian entree. Healthy, too.\n\nBaby Bok Choy in popcorn broth --- I saw a review complain the broth was too bland. Not true. The broth was LIGHT flavored. I don't think it's supposed to be a heavy dish. It's just some nice chicken broth with bok choy. Very healthy and a good companion dish to ma po tofu.\n\nMongolian Long Beans --- spicy spicy spicy! But goooooood. A giant mound of spicy long beans will serve well as a standalone entree, if you can handle the hotness, that is.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami --- sorry, but this was a meh to me. I simply did not like the overly smoky flavor of the meat, and did not really find the blend of red peppers and peanuts to be all that interesting.\n\nWest Lake Rice Porridge --- a very standard, homey congee dish, as a congee shoudl be.\n\nTea-smoked eel --- the name was better than the dish.

I couldn't get past the cumin.  There must have been an entire bottle encrusting the dish.  It wasn't too appealing to bite into solid chunks of cumin.\n\nBraised Pork Belly:  I realize pork belly is really fatty, but there was almost no discernable meat on the three mushy salted chunks of pork belly served.

So let's accept this and move on and think of this place as a \"modern\" and inventive cuisine, albeit in a jarringly mismatched Chinese restaurant setting.

Such pairings are creative and refreshing and opens a new perspective on how to re-invent traditional foods with new ingredients.  Hats off to the chefs for their creative genius.  \n\nHowever, the execution of such new dishes at times falls short of expectations.  \nSlow-Cooked Char-Siu Pork Belly - this just has \"yummy\" written all over it (I mean, what part \"slow-cooked\", \"char-siu\", or \"pork belly\" does not make your mouth water), but here's where 1+1+1 equals less than 3.  The resulting dish did not achieve the normal tenderness of a slow-cooked pork belly, nor does it have the awesome smoky, savory-sweetness of a classic char-siu.  The flavor of the meat was less developed than it should have been.  The consolation prize of the dish was the soy-cured egg - smoky and salty with a soft melty yolk - makes you want to have more.\n\nBroccoli Beef Cheek - I suppose this is the upscale version of the ubiquitous Chinese take out menu item #54 \"Beef with Broccoli\" - turned out ok.  The beef was tasty, and we were pleasantly surprised to bite into a whole poached oyster, which adds so much richness to the dish.  However, the quality of the Chinese Broccoli was quite poor - several pieces were fibrous and tough.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - turned out to be the dish we couldn't stop eating.  Salt Cod is usually quite salty, but they did a great job toning down the salt here, and produced a tasty fried rice.  The rice was cooked well - dry but tender.  The salt cod and the Chinese sausage both contribute to that savory goodness that only preserved meats can provide, rounded out by the freshness of the scallions and softness of the egg.  \n\nI would go back for the Salt Cod Fried Rice, but may have to think twice about some of the other dishes, and waiting in a long line outside for a table.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-09-08"}, {"excerpts": ["Kung Pao Pastrami", ": This is something the husband really wanted; as he hearts pastrami.

It truly reflects what the 2011 San Francisco hipster strata is all about:  a creative, aloof, innovative, young, third world, fast-paced, laid-back melange of California urban culture mated with really good food.\n\nThis is not your grandmother's Chinese restaurant.  You see sesame seeds actually used here to add taste rather than texture.  I've been here twice with my husband, who loves spicy Chinese food.  I don't.  \n\nHe had the most provocative thing he saw on the menu, Kung Pao Pastrami.  Both of us thought it was really good.  But there's no way I could have eaten even a quarter of the whole dish because it was so spicy.  And you can't pick out the spices, either. They're everywhere mixed in with those aforementioned sesame seeds.  If you love spicy, it's definitely worth a try.\n\nThat same evening, I ordered the Salt Cod Fried Rice.  It was really tasty, and a large enough portion for three or four, but I wouldn't want to make a whole meal out of it.  The salt cod was perfectly prepared, moist and not overcooked.  The rice was flecked with lots of green onion and probably cilantro, and onions, I think.\n\nBut neither one of these dishes alone really makes a meal.  The pastrami came with a bowl of rice, but still the meal was off balance, not enough greens.  So to try to balance it, I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles.  Cool, cucumbers, peanut sauce, greens, etc.  But labeled as a 'small plate', it was still too large to match with the other dishes without having a slough of leftovers.\n\nUnfortunately, we got no guidance from our server.  She was barely interested in our presence at the table.  She didn't seem to be too interested in anything, so it wasn't like she was distracted.\n\nI find it interesting that the so-called \"hipsters\" who love to slam a restaurant for poor customer service and bad food (see previous reviews below) are also from the very same ilk who provide it.  Maybe it's a generational thing.  But the service at Mission Chinese is cold and nonchalant at best.  This is something (social skills) they need to work on instead of their tattoos.\n\nOur second visit garnered a better result for me.  Husband again ordered the pastrami.   I ordered the 'small plate' fried pork belly with noodles and cucumbers.  I thought it had all the elements I was looking for in the description.  But this time, the server cautioned me that this was more of an appetizer and that I might find it wanting more.  So taking her advice I ordered a 'small plate' Hainam Chicken Fried Rice.  It came first.\n\nIt was good, but again, it wasn't a meal.  Bits of chicken mixed with fried rice, a bit of chicken fat for flavor and some vinegar to cut the greasy feeling.  I'd order it again, but I was anticipating the pork belly appetizer.  \n\nThis is where I should have started.  It was remarkably good.  The pork belly was fried to the point of caramelization on the outside and it was like butter on the inside.  Eye-rollingly good.  It came resting upon some wide rice noodles rolled up with cilantro and scallions, a few pickled cucumber slices, a soy cured 'soft boiled' egg and hoisin sauce.  Yum!  This was everything I was looking for and I would have been very satisfied (and had more change in my pocket) if I had ordered only this.\n\nBoth times, I topped it off with their Ginger Beer from Australia.  I love it.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, make sure you take a trip to the restroom at the back of the restaurant.  You get to walk through the food staging area, see huge cuts of barbecued beef, lamb, pork prepared expertly, workers checking their iPads for orders and reviews (I surmise) and finally arrive at an adequately clean (for a very busy small restaurant) out the back by the dumpsters, where the air is amazingly refreshing.\n\nThis place could certainly benefit from a nicer piece of real estate, but I think that would somehow cheapen the whole experience.  This is raw San Francisco - heart of the Mission District, heart of the economic crisis from which it sprang (good out of work cooks looking for a cheap way to ply their wares) and really innovative food.  Be sure to check out the beer cans resting in the jaws of the giant dragon suspended from the ceiling.  \n\nOh yeah, and if you're in a hurry, tell them you're willing to share the big table at the back.  Just be prepared to experience the loud rap and hip hop music emanating from the ghetto buster iPod in the back.  Remember, this is not your grandmother's Chinese restaurant.

Why is there a number by each item if they don't want us to use it?\n\nWe ordered the # 21, which was sizzling cumin lamb with chili pickled long beans and #10, which was supposed to be 7 chicken wings with dried red chilies on them. \n\nWe only got 5 wings buried under the red peppers. They were salty and had a slight vinegar and spicy taste, but the dried peppers seemed to be there just for show because they didn't seem to flavor the wings much. We asked what kind of tea they had, and our waitress said \"just Chinese restaurant tea\". I asked is it black tea or oolong or what? She didn't know. She brought a half pot of weak tea.\n\nOur lamb was buried under a heap of sauteed onions. Again, we didn't see the point to so many onions except to hide the fact that the lamb was mostly bones with the meat fried down to a crisp. Some cumin flavor, but mostly a salty flavor. There are other places that serve better cumin lamb with better cuts of lamb and at a lower price. \n\nAlso, there were no pickled long beans with it. We told the waitress. She had to check the menu, went to the kitchen and came back with a bowl of the pickled beans saying \" they told be to just give this to you\" and then she walked away, never to return to our table.\n\nWe never had a chance to tell her that there were only 5 wings instead of 7. There was no rice on the menu and none was offered. We saw her bring rice to other tables, but not ours. Getting eye contact from any of the staff was impossible. They all had dead pan expressions as if they wished they were somewhere else. \n\nA bill was just dropped off at our table without anyone asking \"how was everything?\"\n\nThis place represents the worst of what a restaurant should be.

What do you know - there was no line!\n\nWestlake Rice Porridge oxtail, dungeness crab, soft-poached egg, cilantro\n\nThis was a sort of a hybrid between a Westlake beef soup and a traditional congee (rice porridge). The lineup of ingredients was an all-star cast so I had to order it. Served piping hot, small pieces of crab and oxtail were scattered throughout the bowl filled with bits of soft rice, strands of egg and a clear soup. The dish was fine, somewhat disappointing. I expected the oxtail and crab to play a more prominent role, maybe with a little bit of oxtail stock incorporated into the soup. In actuality, the soup was very mild in flavor and the oxtail/crab really didn't bring a lot to the bowl. Don't get me wrong, the soup was tasty but it didn't live up to its all-star cast of characters.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice escolar confit, chinese sausage, egg, scallion\n\nI thought this was another fun dish using salt cod instead of Chinese dried fish. Its effect was similar, adding a fishy flavor to the rice to pair with the sausage and aromatics. However, we all thought this plate was a bit heavy-handed with the salt.\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Soup Noodles cheung fun, mire poix, cardamom, turnip, broth\n\nWhereas the rice porridge was served hot amid wisps of steam, this soup was served warm. The brisket here was very tender and incredibly smoky, infusing the soup with that flavor. Rice roll noodles added some additional substance to the full-flavored dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami explosive chili, celery, potato, roasted peanut, steamed rice\n\nA familiar preparation of pastrami was stir fried kung pao style with something called \"explosive chili.\" I was fearful but actually found the heat to be present but not unbearable. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I thought there was a pretty decent balance of ingredients. My dad wanted more meat and less \"filler\" ingredients though.\n\nMy dad said this meal was definitely better than his previous experience, but the meal still did not live up to high hopes. I thought the food was \"just okay\" (definitely not awful), with flavors not really coming together as well as I had wanted.

Everything I eat here is a fantasy fulfilled in how I want Chinese food to taste.

That being said, I checked out this talked-about restaurant the other day - let's just say that Mission Chinese (and Richman) did not disappoint. \n\nThe food is terrific and the flavors are bold (not to mention all meats and vegetables are local organic). Many of Mission's dishes are precisely as \"Chinese\" as its owner Danny Bowien (who never cooked Chinese food until he opened his restaurant). \n\nFood to taste: \n- Westlake Rice Porridge - is a perfectly-hearty, simple yet deep-flavored dish - braised oxtail, dungeness crab,  and hints of cilantro and ginger.\n- Thrice Cooked Bacon - a \"must\" for any bacon lover. Thick, mouth-watering strips of bacon, rice cake, scallions, chili oil.\n- Kung Pao Pastrami - If you enjoy spicy food, this has a kick (and then some). Slices of pastrami with explosive flavors of poblano and serrano chilis.\n\nAlso recommended:\n- Escolar and chinese salad\n- Chinese custard\n\nThings to note:\n- Cheap prices (accepts plastic)\n- Dress casual (think diner / dive style)\n- Get there before 6pm to avoid the line\n- No reservations\n- Don't be fooled by its awning - Mission Chinese Food is housed inside a pre-existing, old-style Chinese spot called Lung Shan.  \n\nAs Richman said, \"I think Bowien is a secret genius.\" I absolutely agree. His story is fantastic, but his food is even better.

Not too fatty with a good \"rind\" on it.  It was a melt in your mouth not too salty experience\nMa Po Tofu - Really good an da favorit of more than one.  The tofu was a little slimy fo rme (but that's tofu) but the spice was magical!  Not too much just enough to make it interesting.\nKung Pao Pastrami - Patrami was so tasty - the amount was fine it was not greasy.\nBroccoli Beef Brisket - Amazingly tender brisket with tons of CHinese broccoli in a good sauce.  REally nice annise notes.\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - Yummy though nothing really crazy good.  I couldn't really discern the taste of the salt cod.\nSquid Ink Noodles - SO GOOD!!!  The noodles are HUGE and were very well cooked and were quite tasty.  Not sure if there really was any add from the ink but it was really tasty and enjoyed by all.  \nLong Beans - AWESOME but VERY SPICY!!!  I got a jalapeno by accident and WOO HOOO.  \nThrice Cooked Bacon with Rice Cakes - The bacon in this was SOOO nice and the small rice cakes were awesome (think quarter or 50 cent sized discs).\n\nAnd the best part we had 8 folks for dinner who drank beer and the tab was a little over $200!!!!!  This was an amazing feat and everyone enjoyed it massively and we were all absolutely stuffed.\n\nIn conclusion - take this for what it is... a very positive review from someone that can be picky but that can also embrace a TWIST on a particular type of food (be it nouveau southern, fusion, whatever).

Flavors were different and blended together well in many cases.\n \nWell jump to  4 years later, I am back with some friends and parents. I didn't expect my traditional chinese parents to get the twist on the dishes, but at least they would experience different ways of preparing traditional chinese comfort food and get a kick out of the flavors.  The wait is about 1 hr long, even for a Sunday night.  We ordered about 9 things off of the menu.  The highlight was the egg-egg noodle ( which was not salty), and the low light was between the mongolian long bean and sizzling lamb served on a sizzling platter.  The mongolian long bean was salty to the point of inedible.  There was some chinese spice in the bean that made my mouth tangy and numb, and whatever salt was in the beans was magnified about 100 times.  I could not eat a bite of food for about 5 minutes while I waited for the taste in my mouth to clear away.  The sizzling lamb had a very small about of  lamb in it and it tasted dried and way over cooked, plus it wasn't sizzling (not sure why it is served on the sizzling platter).   We also ordered a kung pao pastrami.  The pastrami meat itself is salty to begin with, and the other kung pao ingredients were also salty.  The beef noodle was very different than any other I've ever had. It has a smoked beef brisket in a soy sauce broth which was a nice mixture.  But because there was so much salt in the other 3 dishes, I had a very negative reaction to the entire meal, and I couldn't wait for the meal to end this night because this is the second place I've brought my parents where I was very disappointed (the other being michelin rated Commis in Oakland which I have not written about yet on Yelp).

I'm still thinking about it a day later.  And the Salt Cod Fried Rice was addictive!  It had perfect texture and a wonderful depth of flavor for a single dish.  I was floored about how good it was for a supposedly simple rice dish.

It was an interesting concept but hard to eat and the leaves did not hold the 'dressing' so it pooled on the plate and you were left munching just greens.  The rice porridge was great!  The chunks of oxtail were flavorful and the egg had a pungency that went well with the soothing rice soup. The Kung Pao pastrami was a fantastic dish.  Tender beef slices, the potatoes utterly wonderful, well seasoned with a smoky flavor.  Loved loved loved this dish.

The waiter and waitress who attended us were also pushy when we were deicing to order and asked if we knew what we wanted before we even sat down. \n\nThe pork mapo tofu was probably the most disappointing dish I have ever had, and I have had plenty of mapo tofu in my life. Upon first taste, the soft tofu with spice is delicious, but then the worst after taste comes immediately after. My boyfriend also thought the same about the dish; the tofu was nicely cooked but the sauce was unpleasant. It was spicy, but had a tangy aftertaste that burned the tongue in a strange way I had never experienced before. \n\nThe broccoli beef brisket was interesting, but had much too salt to actually enjoy it. The dish was mainly broccoli stalks with a skimpy portion of cubed brisket. There was a sauce that overpowered the entire dish to the point where the broccoli didn't taste like a vegetable and the beef tasted like a sauce sponge instead of meat. The idea of this dish is great, but poorly executed in a way where the flavors did not agree and work together. Less sauce and salt would have definitely done this dish some justice.\n\nThe salt cod fried rice was just ok. It reminded me of homemade friend rice, so it was nothing outstanding or great despite the multiple raves for this dish. Typically, salt cod fried rice lives up to its name of being salty rice dish, but with the tofu and brisket dish being so over flavored with salt and sauce, the rice tasted lacking. Salt does not equal \"flavor.\"\n\nOverall, this place is a complete miss. Parking was also a hassle on a weeknight so we had to park over 1.5 miles away, so definitely consider walking or taking public transit. I feel that the hype for this place gave me expectations that could have been met, but Mission Chinese Food dropped the ball. The food was also priced for the portions and quality, with most dishes being over $10 with messy presentation. Overly salted food, lack of service, and disgusting environment and atmosphere makes MCF a no-go for me.", "rating": 1, "date": "2017-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["We had no problems getting a table for Friday lunch, and between four of us shared the Chongqing chicken wings, the Mongolian Long Beans, Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes, and Broccoli Beef Brisket, with some steamed rice.

I am drooling just remembering this meal.\n\nOkay first up - chicken wings. We were warned that Szechuan spice is different than spicy food we may be used to - it sort of numbs your mouth more than overtly burns it.  This is totally true, and these chicken wings will definitely do that to you.  They were dry-fried, which my husband loved, as he is a chicken wing aficionado and sometimes gets tired of the ones soaking in sauce.  Crispy, piping hot, and numbingly spicy as previously mentioned, these were a hit for my husband, and I liked them, but not as much as he did.  I loved the texture, maybe the numbing was too much for me?  I don't know.  They're worth a try, though.\n\nEverything else, however, was perfection.

I got a jalapeno by accident and WOO HOOO.  \nThrice Cooked Bacon with Rice Cakes - The bacon in this was SOOO nice and the small rice cakes were awesome (think quarter or 50 cent sized discs).\n\nAnd the best part we had 8 folks for dinner who drank beer and the tab was a little over $200!!!!!

The restaurant is clean, food is quality (although sometimes greasy and salty), service is good and the beer selection pairs well with Sichuan food. A lot of the food, however, are too greasy and salty for me sometimes. They use a lot of Sichuan peppercorns and chili flakes and chili oil, sometimes to a point where it is overbearing and makes everything tastes the same. That being said, it becomes important that you know what to order to have a well balanced meal and experience here.\n\nMy suggestion is to order 2 spicy dishes and 2 mild dishes.

Finding out that it made Michael Bauer's Top 100 in the Sunday Chronicle, Jamie W. and I made a beeline to 18th and Mission early on Sunday evening to give it a try before the inevitable stampede.

They're just applying French terms here at Mission La Cuisine Chinoise. ...See what I did there?\n\nWhile the flavors are primarily Szechuan, you can play a good game of \"What Doesn't Belong?\" with their menu.

This was actually good and using cheung fun as the noodle was interesting.  I would love if they used hand cut noodle instead.  It couldn't quite redeem the experience, but if I had eaten only this dish, I would've come back for other dishes with high expectations.  It tastes like the pan-fried noodle soup at Turtle Tower (#6 Ph B\u00f2 \u00c1p Cho Nc) and Taiwanese beef noodle soup (niu ro mien) had a baby.

This is the only dish I'd come back for.  \n\n\nXX) PORK BELLY - $XX\n\nThis isn't on the website, so I don't have the exact menu info.  We had their pork belly with pineapple and cucumber.  It was pretty good but way too fatty.  One of the pieces of pork belly was pure fat, zero meat.  That's a ripoff.  And gross. \n\n\nXX) SHORT RIBS - $XX\n\nThis was okay; a few folks at the table complained that it was fatty, but my piece was tender off the bone and decent.\n\n\n21)    SHANGHAINESE CHOW MEIN - $12\nPULLED PORK TROTTER, ROCK SHRIMP, PICKLED MUSTARD GREENS, NAPA CABBAGE\n\nThis was one of the better dishes of the evening, and I feel like all it did was taste like chow mein from a decent Chinese restaurant.  Umm, good job?\n\n\n22) SALT COD FRIED RICE - $10\nESCOLAR CONFIT,CHINESE SAUSAGE, EGG,SCALLION\n\nThis one, I have mixed feelings about.  While the pieces of cod were larger than the traditional dish (a nice change), there was nary a Chinese sausage to be found in the fried rice.  Perhaps they forgot about it.  I don't have a problem with that.  But I ate a lot of salt cod and chicken fried rice growing up.  That was the dish I would order.  It's supposed to be small pieces of cod with pieces of chicken (in this case, sausage).  On its own... it seemed lacking.  This was also one of the better dishes... and this was just just average.\n\n\n16)   MA PO TOFU - $11\nGROUND KUROBUTA PORK SHOULDER,SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN, CHILl OIL, STEAMED RICE\n\nToo spicy and pretty sour.  Not much to say about this dish, because I don't really eat this one often. Enough to have had better. \n\n\n23) SIZZLING CUMIN LAMB - $13\nSALT & PEPPERED LAMB BELLY, CHILl-PICKLED LONG BEANS\n\nI ate this just because it had been ordered by our group.  The whole restaurant smells like this dish so it must be popular.  Cumin also smells that strong.\n\nSTEAMED RICE\n\nDry as the desert.

While I appreciate the creativity like with the kung pao pastrami, I thought they under-performed on more classic, signature dishes like the fried rice.   I think they also use less sugar than the average Chinese restaurant in SF; though they use just as much grease.   It's fun to try the various dishes, so it's better to have more people.

Thin strips of daikon added a welcomed CRUNCH.\nStir-Fried Sweet Peas - A gentler flavor profile, the natural sweetness from the peas was delectable.\nExplosive Chicken Wings - Crispy but too salty, and I can handle me some sodium.\n\nThey definitely don't shy away from flavors.

We ordered the kung pao pastrami, broccoli beef cheek, tingly lamb noodle soup, tea-smoked eel, and salt cod fried rice.  Our favorite dish was the broccoli beef cheek - incredibly tender.  The kung pao pastrami was indeed spicy, so I didn't try very much of it.  The tea-smoked eel was probably my second favorite dish, and the salt cod fried rice added a nice complement to some of the heavier dishes.  I did enjoy the lamb in the tingly soup but I hated the tingle - it just lasted too long for me to enjoy the dish.  I think next time, I'll skip the tingly soup and just order the sizzling cumin lamb.\n\nAmbiance is entertaining, very hipster SF.

Arriving at a little after 7 PM on a Tuesday evening, we stood outside with the crowd on the street and waited for 45 minutes as assorted homeless indigents encouraged us to \"help them out\". When our table was ready, we found the interior of the restaurant to be somewhat dilapidated and decorated in a weird mish-mash of cheap Chinese restaurant decor (a few red \"scrolls\" and lanterns), Chinese gift shop (specifically, the extra-large blow-up dragon hanging from the ceiling) with a college dorm room (namely the white Christmas lights strewn around the restaurant). On top of that, they play hip hop not too inconspicuously: chowing down while listening to Bone Thugs and Ludacris, I was left unsure as to whether or not I should be getting up and busting a move.\n\nFood items:\nBeer-brined Sichuan pickle: pickled napa cabbage that was moderately salty and just a little sour from the beer, a decent starter that would've been better with rice.\n\nSmashed cucumbers in garlic sauce: essentially fresh smashed small cucumbers served with garlic hummus and fresh minced chilies. Delicious, but only vaguely Chinese.\n\nTiger salad: some assorted bitter greens encompassed by a single layer of wide rice noodle, with a mostly unidentifiable and totally forgettable vinagrette (?). I feel somewhat ashamed for having ordered this, but to our credit, some prior Yelp pictures had us mistaking this for the beer-brined Sichuan pickle.\n\nSavory egg custard: a new dish per our waitress, it is essentially a egg custard (almost like a chilled version of what you get at Korean BBQ) served in tomato water with a decent amount of uni, trout roe, and minced shiso leaves. Separately, all these components are actually delicious. Together, they formed a cold hodge-podge with no common element, a sum that is less than the individual parts.\n\nSliced peanut noodles: perfectly cooked wide rice noodles served with a slightly watered down peanut sauce. I like my peanut sauce actually heavy on the peanut, but the effective cooking of the he-fen left me envious.\n\nThrice cooked bacon: holy cow, is this dish smoky. Crispy and yet not completely dried out pieces of chewy bacon are stir-fried with slightly numbing chilies, thin slivers of bitter melon, all in chili oil. A potent combination that was hard to resist picking at even when full.\n\nSizzling cumin lamb: for those of you who cannot handle gamey meats, this dish brought the barnyard along with the lamb on the plate. The meat is certainly tender and well prepared, at least. I was looking for a heavier hand with the cumin; I may in fact stir-fry my leftovers with more cumin.\n\nSalt cod fried rice: our favorite dish of the night. A very delicately prepared (if that is possible for fried rice) dish with good balance of salt, sweet from the chinese sausage, and starch with just a tiny shred of lettuce to keep it tasting slightly fresh. It honestly reminded me of late nights of post-clubbing Chinese food back in Boston, a cleaner and less funky version of salted chicken and fermented fish fried rice served in venues like Chow Chau City.\n\nVerdict: apparently we came to this restaurant looking for Chinese food, and what we found was...50% something else. At over $40 a head for this level of meh (even though we have a boatload of leftovers), I'm actually very surprised that Danny Bowien won the James Beard for Rising Star Chef.

Let's make that with lamb belly instead.\n\nIt makes sense in my mind because he's taking your Chinese flavors and playing around with the cuts of meat or introducing a different technique. A good example of this is the Ma Po Tofu. When you get it, it's Ma Po Tofu in a truly authentic form, but he steps it up by using ground Kurobuta pork shoulder. This isn't your weird goopy messy at a run-of-the-mill Chinese joint. This Ma Po Tofu tastes like what you get in China.\n\nI went yesterday to try out his new dishes using a smoker for \"Chinese BBQ\". It's funny because he's pairing a Mexican coke/hoisin sauce bbq sauce with a Texas-style BBQ meal. The brisket tastes like a BBQ joint brisket with an Asian twang. You even get the slices of white bread like in Texan BBQ joints. It wasn't my favorite, but the Xian Lamb Cheeks and Pork Trotters were crazy good.\n\nThe Kung Pao Corned Beef was my favorite of the night, combining sliced potatoes, chinese celery, roasted peanuts, tossed in a spicy concoction with his house-made corned beef. It sounds weird. It tastes great.\n\nI continually enjoy the food here, and I'm never bored of it.", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-03-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Cumin Lamb - Awsome\n", "Tea smoked eel ", "- I can not wait to eat again\nEgg custard - TO DIE FOR\nWe pretty much ordered the whole menu as we were unable to choose just a few.

Tasty but too much sauce, couldn't taste tea nor eel\n\n-Pork Jowl w/Winter Radishes: Kind of tart and the radishes are super-mini gumball sized. I enjoyed eating them but hardly recall any pork, let alone jowl.\n\n-Chicken Wings: they're actually drummettes, served swimming in a bed of chilies. Spicy and had a real strange slightly citrus, cooling, numbing effect on the tongue. We were wondering if they accidentally dropped something into the seasoning bucket because the sensation in our mouths was so unusual. Bothersome. \n\n-Salt Cod Fried Rice: it's fried rice, whatever. You could get fried rice in Chinatown for probably $2, not $10. This is one of there least flavorful dishes, meaning it's good to have on hand to balance out everything else. Still, I would save money by ordering plain rice.\n\n-Sizzling Cumin Lamb: very tender, too salty, too much fat, mostly bone.\n\n-Lamb Noodle Soup: a brown broth (think Thai), quite opposite the pale, cooling chicken broth-based soups served in most Cantonese establishments. Flavorful like everything else but nothing to take note of.\n\n-Chow Mein (please pronounce it \"meen\" w/ a quick, downward tone not \"main\", because that's incorrect in any dialect!): not bad, good to balance the more flavorful plates but again, I  could get this for a few dollars in Chinatown.\n\nService: they do not have time to check on you and probably won't refill your water. \n\nAmbiance: the only lights are white Christmas strands flanking the walls at table height; so dim you squint a little to take a good look at your food.

I came around 5pm and there was already a small line outside. I was stopped by a clipboard outside of the shop presenting the crossed out names from each customer that already stepped foot inside. I must've been #20 something but was escorted inside within minutes. As I entered through, I noticed the dim lighting that darkened the room, the red Chinese New Year dragon hanging across the restaurant ceiling, the yellow walls, a crowded room with people talking and eating up, and the smell of Chinese food streaming across the room. It was a sight to see. The restaurant isn't that big anyway..tight pathways for people to walk through. I ordered the mouth watering chicken which contained smoked chicken, chicken hearts, and sichuan peppers. I had their famous Kung Pao Pastrami which was salty but was very unique. They used up whole slices of pastrami and created this traditional dish using celery and roasted peanuts. The cumin lamb was off the charts. The meat was tender and full of that cumin flavor which also arrived sizzling to our table. My favorite was the Cod fried rice because it had a different type of taste to it.

But we ended up picking items from just the MCF menu.\n\nVegetarian Delight - I barely even read this description, but they suggested it to us when they told us there were no pork dumplings and we still wanted soup.  First off, the name does not do it justice.  This is soup and not some mish-mash of veggies, which is what I would think based on the name.  It's three mushroom/veggie dumpling in this broth that was just out of this world.  A lot of times, I'm tempted to dump soy sauce or chili in broth-y soups cause they just don't have a lot of flavor.  Not this one.  This was not in-your-face-crazy, but rather a very delicate and yet super flavorful broth.  4.5 stars.\n\nTiger Salad - this was a bunch of herbs/greens stuffed in a rice crepe and then drizzled with chili oil.  A surprising burst of freshness and bold flavors that really woke up my taste buds.  I imagine this to be a staple for me.  Be warned though, it is very filling.  5 stars.\n\nTaiwanese Eggplant - I've never met an eggplant dish I didn't like, but I was a little underwhelmed by this.  It was good for sure, but maybe I was expecting amazing after the first two dishes.  3 stars.\n\nSizzling Cumin Lamb - wow.  Very stimulating to my eyes/ears (the smoke wafting from the sizzling goodness), nose (earthy, cumin/onion goodness), and mouth.  Oh the flavors and the texture!  The meat was very tender and although it was at times fatty, it was complemented by the crisp onions that soaked up all the cumin lamb flavors.  Yum!  5 stars.\n\nOverall - For all of that, it amounted to less than $40.  It really could have fed 3-4 people, but since I was soooo hungry, it only fed two of us.  But then again, I barely ate the rest of the day cause I was so full.  Definitely the value here is great.  Service though was just okay.  Granted, it was new year's day and apparently their regular people weren't working (it was the cook giving us our teapot, but forgetting the tea cups).

I suppose it's \"spicy.\" It wasn't for my guy, but he's half korean. It was slightly spicy for me, but not unbearably so. I'd say it's about a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  The lack of flavor though... ugh. \n\nHainan was still more meh. Rice was chicken flavored. Peanuts were a nice textural touch. Part of eating Hainan Chicken rice is in the presentation. We weren't served chicken separately. It only came to us as slightly shredded and mixed into the rice. Definitely atypical. I feel a little jipped about the lack of chicken to be honest. Although it is \"authentic\" to include a quarter of a chicken with the rice, we definitely did not have even 1/5 worth of chicken shredded into our rice. \n\nI know my experience is from delivery food, but really?

I'm just a simple lo-fan so I know not what I speak of, however, I did grow up eating northern chinese cuisine at my buddy's house three times a week so I think I have the right to say a little something. Also, I've been to china several times recently, so have dipped my beak in the fountain of authenticity.\n\nEvery time I liked it, but something was just a little off.  First, the Ma Po Tofu.  The first couple times, I really liked it - very hot, a little greasy, lovely szechuan peppercorn tingle, good light texture to the sauce, a peppery burn - very interesting, if the flavors were somehow not quite spot on.  Unfortunately, they have now changed the recipe, which gives it a deeper meatier flavor, but that meaty flavor now overwhelms the Tofu, and turns a relatively light, spicy dish into a heavy gloopy meat stew that has a texture closer to Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee than anything else.  Af first I was puzzled about the change, but I asked the chef about it and he said that he had indeed changed the recipe.  Not sure what to say about it - I still kind of liked it, but it reminded me of nothing so much as the sucking sound that comes when one pours Spaghetti-O's out of a can.  \n\nHome made pickles.

We have tons of wine left over from a recent party so I thought it would be nice to take a bottle or two.  I called to ask and received a long 10 seconds of \"uuuummmm\" from the guy who answered the phone.  He put me on hold to ask someone else and came back with \"no you can't bring your own wine\".  I thought that was odd, so I looked back on Yelp reviews and sure enough just 2 days prior there was a review saying that they brought their own wine.  Naturally I called back to confirm.  Same guy - \"Uuummmmm, well, I don't know.  Wait hold on.\".  He passed on the phone to someone else.  I, very nicely and politely said \"Hi\" and got cut off by a very RUDE \"Yeah, do you have a question because we're really busy right now..\"  What the..!  Anyway, I did have a question, which I asked and sure enough you can bring your own wine with a minimal corkage fee.  Fine.  On to Mission Chinese.

Locale leaves a bit to be desired - I can't tell if it's appropriate or just plain dingy.  \n\nFirst visit - Ma Po Tofu, Szechuan Pickles.  Ma Po Tofu was excellent: fiery and rich, the Berkshire pork showed especially well.  Would have liked some flower pepper, though.  Szechuan pickles were less impressive - good kick with the flower and chili peppers, but a little too acidic for me.  \n\nVisit II - Szechuan Chicken Wings, West Lake Rice Porridge.  Wings were fine - it's hard for me to not like anything fried szechuan-style.  Porridge was AWESOME - great rainy day comfort food.  Oxtail and dungeness lend it a lot of richness which is cut nicely by the ginger and cilantro.\n\nPart III - Tea-Smoked Eel, Thrice-Cooked Bacon, Cumin Lamb.  Eel is definitely worth a try - eel comes wrapped in cheong fun (cool presentation), with celery (good contrast), and possibly fried noodle (good for texture).  Fun take on cheong fun.  Thrice-Cooked Bacon was equally kick-ass - great spin on nian gao (shanghai rice cake).  Spicy peppers, rich fatty pork goodness, and some slightly sweet tofu skin made for a unique and well-balanced dish.  Cumin lamb also had some great flavors going on (interesting presentation with huge chunks of lamb belly on bone).  The accompanying side of pickled long bean was nice (though a bit salty on its own).\n\nIt's hard to pin down what's going on here.  I don't buy Mission Chinese Food's claims of being \"Americanized\" per se, it's a place I'd happily take my parents and grand parents to.  It's certainly a unique take on Chinese food, borrowing from many regions.  To me, it's fun, light-hearted, and also a great take on Chinese dishes and cooking styles.  Many Chinese dishes can be a bit one-dimensional - the dishes here always have a lot going on and show great balance and depth.  Great value, too - it's quickly turning into a staple in my diet.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-03-24"}, {"excerpts": ["Sizzling cumin lamb - Milder heat with green chiles & onions.

I mean that as the highest of compliments, so I hope it's not taken in the wrong way!  It's a California/American take on (mostly) Sichuanese food in the same way Momofuku is a New York/American take on Korean/Japanese food.\n\nI'd venture to say that the Yelp reviews are MCF are so bimodal because of the difference in expectation.  If you go expecting traditional renditions of your favorite Chinese dishes, you will be sorely disappointed.  You're better off saving that experience for somewhere in the South Bay (or better yet, the SGV waaaay down south!).\n\nThat being said, I thought MCF was just outstanding.  The dishes I had were exploding with flavor.  They were also quite spicy (it helps that I absolutely loooove spicy food and the ma la quality which characterizes so much of Sichuanese cuisine).  I also thought the dishes were quite thoughtful and creative.\n\nIf you don't want to get too intellectual about it -- just go because the food is interesting and delicious.  But it's definitely not traditional.\n\nWhat we've tried so far:\nEgg custard with uni & trout roe - The coldness caught me by surprised even though it's in the 'cold dishes' section of the menu (duh).  Very crisp, clean, and seafood-y tasting.  If you don't like fish, steer clear of the fish roe.  The shiso was a nice and unexpected complement to the briny, fishy flavors.\n\nNumbing lamb mien - Hand-pulled noodles had amazing flavor and texture.  Spot-on.  Spicy and numbing as promised -- but also oh-so-flavorful.  If you have a low heat tolerance, you'll probably only taste the spiciness.\n\nSizzling cumin lamb - Milder heat with green chiles & onions.  Speckled with whole cumin seeds, which made for a nice contrast of textures.  Lamb belly was rich and unctuous.  \n\nYoung mustard greens -- Not spicy at all.  Nicely blanched and  then tossed with minced garlic with good crunch and flavor to the greens.  Excellent complement to all the other fiery dishes we had!\n\nThrice cooked pork -- I was surprised to find dduk (Korean rice cakes) in a 'Chinese' dish but then again, this isn't really a traditional joint.  Fatty, spicy and delicious.  What else can I say?\n\nTotal bill (including two beers and a ginger beer):  $70 plus tip.\n\nThe wait was longer than expected (we were told '30 minutes') but it was probably closer to 40-45.  It was absolutely worth it though.  Even though the place was packed and our server was a little harried, we never felt rushed or pressured to leave, which was an unexpected bonus.\n\nDefinitely go.  Even though I'm going to call this place 'fusion,' it's not fusion like PF Changs.  It's just mouth-wateringly good.  Extra bonus points since we got to watch Danny Bowien pulling noodles in the window -- shortly thereafter, he personally brought our our cumin lab dish.

I should've known that when I realized I was the only Asian customer in the nearly 80% occupied restaurant.  My biggest issue was the excessive usage of chili pepper/jalape\u00f1o.  It made me wonder:  are they using the chili to mask the lack of depth in their dishes' flavors? \n\n1)  Slow Cooked char siu pork belly \n-The dish came with 5 pieces of pork belly beautifully cooked.  It's fatty and flavorful.  Unfortunately, portion was cut too big.  I felt sick after having half of 1 piece.  In other restaurants where I enjoyed similar dish, the meat would be cut more into a bite-size portion.  Tea-smoked egg was just okay.  The flavor was barely detectable after eating a couple of other [tongue-numbing] dishes.\n\n2) Salt Cod fried rice\n-one of the my two most-likable dishes of the meal.  Nicely balanced flavors.  When it first came out, cod pieces were too salty.  However, the left-over next day was much better.  Good 'day after' dish.\n\n3) Thrice cooked bacon\n-the bacon had a nice smoky flavor.  Rice cake was cooked well with a chewy bite.  Again, it was seasoned with too much chili oil that over-powered most of the ingredients.  When I was able to successfully uncover a single piece of a rice cake or bitter melon that's not overly covered by the chili oil, I was quite happy the original flavor combination (sans chili oil)\n\n4) Taiwanese eggplant\n-my favorite dish of the night.  Eggplant was cooked nicely with a wonderful balance of basil flavor.  I don't know how Taiwanese it was, but I'd say that was one dish more recognizable as Chinese food.\n\n5) 7 chicken wings with explosive chili pepper\n-imagine a large serving plate with 7 little wings on.  Then, pile on chili pepper after chili pepper until it resembles a small mountain.  To eat the wings, you have to fish them out under the big pile of pepper.  After you've consumed all wings, you wouldn't be able to tell that you didn't just simply order a large plate of chili pepper with nothing else.  Taste?  I doubt anyone tasted anything after their taste buds have been numbed by all the spiciness in all other dishes.  The skin was a bit dry & chewy... not in a good way.\n\n6) Sizzling cumin lamb\n-if I could imagine less chili oil, the flavors probably worked well.

It's 80% in the styling of an early nineties Chinese joint that I grew up with - down to the menu and wooden tables - and 20% owner's personality. Dragon and lights hanging from the ceiling were a sight as well as the mostly hip-hop soundtrack. You can't sleep on the art in the restaurant as well - personally admired the one with the Chinese men on horses. I also respect how they advertised the Asian Art Museum.\n\nFor the food, the rice cakes with (vegan option) bacon was unexpectedly sweet. It was less spicy than what I remembered it to be but still flavorful. It was also a bit tangier (in a very good way) than my next dish. The Sour Chili Chicken had a nice surprise with the potatoes. Garlic Fried Rice went well with the Nori. Mint and Oolong tea to wash it down; it was the perfect closer.\n\nOne note though: I can't give the W to this over my hometown team.

Those past experiences were everything other people have said; their food was delicious and innovative. There's a reason they are internationally famous at this point. Unfortunately, as a foodie, a home chef, and someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I have to now give them a one star review.\n\nI ordered delivery again tonight, and the food, for the first time ever, was awful. I ordered the sour chili chicken, the market greens and an order of rice. I've ordered these dishes many times and they have always been impeccable. This time, the rice had literally no stickiness whatsoever. The greens were tough like they had barely been cooked, and under-seasoned. The chicken was cold and flavorless. And, about halfway through my bowl I found a long hair in my food. Mission Chinese has always been very consistent. Consistency, I feel, is one of the most important aspects of running a restaurant. It establishes trust with the customer and the integrity of your brand. I can understand one or two minor mistakes; but to go from internationally famous cuisine to awful, overpriced delivery in an instant is unforgivable.\n\nFortunately, as I said, I'm a very proficient home chef, and I just purchased their cook book, so I will probably be able to produce better results at home compared even to the restaurant's original awesomeness, simply because well-cooked home food is always going to be better than what you can get in even the most high-end restaurants. I purchased all of the ingredients for the thrice-cooked bacon a couple of days ago, and I can't wait to eat it over freshly cooked donabe rice.\n\nThe unfortunate side is that I no longer have a solid, amazing and convenient Chinese food delivery option. And I will probably not visit the restaurant again now. It's especially sad because they really were one of the best Chinese food restaurants in the city. There are many other restaurants that for some reason have had much longer staying power in terms of consistent quality, delivering the same excellent product for years or even decades. Sadly, some restaurants just don't have that kind of stamina, and the quality eventually falls. I'm especially saddened that Mission Chinese is one of these restaurants as opposed to the former. \n\nThank you Mission Chinese for the excellent food in the past, opening my mind to the possibilities of Asian fusion, and the excellent cook book that will yield countless unforgettable meals for myself, my spouse and my friends; so long.", "rating": 1, "date": "2017-10-09"}, {"excerpts": ["The carnivore side of the table opted for the Kung Pao Pastrami, the Beef Chow Mein, the Sour Chili Chicken, and the Ginger Scallion Chicken Fat Fried Rice.

I couldn't wait for our new to be called, and just as I started to wonder when we'd get in, our table was called! \n\nId finally made it and I felt like I was entering hallowed ground as I passed through the doorway into the warm, dark and humid dining room, illuminated by glowing red lights and guarded by a giant golden Chinese dragon overhead. At first I was bothered by the temperature, wondering if id be able to enjoy my meal, but that quickly faded as I began to peruse the menu. The dishes here are like nothing you've seen before, bringing together traditional Chinese ingredients in some very inspired and non-traditional ways. \n\nAs a crew that likes to eat and drink, we had about 12-14 dishes on the table for the 9 diners, and by the end of it all, the carnage was something to behold. We ordered the Mongolian Long beans, stir fried with dried Asian chiles, Serrano chiles and chile paste, the Tiki Pork Belly exterior crisped to perfection and complimented by the unctuous and meaty interior and sweet sauce, 3X Bacon with Rice Cakes and Bitter Melon, Tiger Salad, Squid Ink Noodles, Cod Fried Rice, Sour Chili Chicken, Explosively spicy wings and more!\n\nMy favorite bit was the 3X Bacon, thin slices of lightly smoked pork belly served with chewy Chinese rice cakes and thinly sliced bitter melon, was an incredible bite of food. The bacon was thin but meaty with a light charcoal/hardwood smoked flavor that played really well with the bitterness of the bitter melon and spicy/savory/salty sauce and the rice cake added the perfect texture. I couldn't stop eating this combo throughout the meal. \n\nThe surprise of the night was the Tiger Salad. Described as simple and light by our server, this dish arrived and had us all confused. On a long plate stood three bundles of lightly dressed fresh herbs, ties together by wide pieces of chow fun rice noodles. They were roughly 3-4\" tall! The freshness of the salad was the perfect contrast to the rich and spicy dishes on the table, and I would suggest this as something anyone who comes should order.\n\nThe star of the night was the squid ink noodles, which are served with cumin spiced and charred lamb, harissa, a few fresh greens and a tangy yogurt sauce. As with a lot of Asian food, texture is important and the noodles added that beautifully. The ground lamb was delicate and delicious, providing a warm spice from the cumin, which combined nicely with a light heat from the Harissa. The surprise ingredient was the yogurt sauce, which rounded out and carried all of the flavors across your palate, bringing you back for more.  These are clearly freshly made noodles, and taking this to go would ruin their perfectly chewy texture, which is why it's only available dine in, and well worth waiting for!\n\nBite after bite of this spicy fare had me mopping my brow and downing glass after glass of reasonably priced, moderately cold, sake, which in turn had me focused on the next bite and forgetting about the warmth in the room.

This attempt at subterfuge will simply not work! It was at best only  a fleeting and temporary annoyance, like a pebble in my shoe. I burst forth into the temple and (after waiting a minute for the hipster waiter outside to finish his smoke break) was whisked away (rather languidly) to my table. I kept thinking \"faster damn you!\" and \"can we fast forward through the formalities and get down to business?\" But alas, social constructs (civility, courtesy) have a powerful hold on us and so I had to endure the ritual of waiting for my beverage to arrive before placing an order.\nBut when the opportunity came I pounced- a baby dragon bursting forth from its crib with flames and froth emanating from the sides of its mouth.\n\nAfter feigning uncertainty (I had of course studied the menu to the point that I could see it with my eyes closed as I lay in bed the previous night), I ordered the following:\n\nTea-smoked eel rolls and Grandma's pork dumplings to further wet an already drenched appetite.\n\nSour chili chicken, because I was feeling silly and I really like shishito peppers. Yeah, anyway.\n\nReflections and Musings:\n\nThe Tea-smoked eel rolls were like a pagoda but instead of roof over roof there was layer upon layer of texture and taste. I had to go back to the menu to decipher what it was that had perplexed my taste buds. I have to conclude that it was the salted plum hoisin sauce and cognac soy that had colluded to slay the picky beast that lurks in my palate. I was conquered without a shot. All it took was one bite.  \n\nGrandma's pork dumplings were served in a bowl with ham broth. The dumplings weren't floating so much as just soaking a little, the way you would dangle your feet into a swimming pool while keeping the rest of your body out of the water. These little jewels had been steamed to perfection. Each bite was preceded by a rapidly learned behavior similar to Pavlov's dogs. You could say I was merely drooling. So much so that Pavlov would lean over and say \"keep it together man\" (through a translator of course).\n\nThe sour chili chicken took the chicken tenders of my youth and replaced that memory with something mightier and more delicious.  The malange of shishito pepper, chicken tender and little marble potatoes was a well-constructed fusion of smells and textures.

Not too spicy but definitely flavorful. You won't start sweating or hiccupping from chili intoxication despite the little flame by the menu entry. You might giggle with joy at how good this dish tastes. \n\nMy one request (a sure sign of the looming demise of good health) is to dial down the sodium if at all possible. I know, I know, that's like asking for grandma to stop squeezing your cheeks in front of your friends. Possible but not probable.\n\nAnd a side of steamed white rice has to be ordered separately.

We agreed we would go to Mission Chinese, a recommendation from his brother. When I first saw the place, I was confused as to why the sign doesn't say \"Mission Chinese Food\" but \"Lung Shan Restaurant.\" And then I saw the sticker with the Mission Chinese Food rickshaw on the window of the restaurant and felt that it was oddly familiar...\n\nOkay, so this place's twin sister in New York was featured in Anthony Bourdain's show \"The Layover.\" I immediately got excited because I adore Anthony Bourdain and have so far loved everything he recommended. This place is... very different. There is a huge Chinese paper dragon that hangs on the ceiling throughout the place while EDM-y music blasts away. The place was mostly dark with a lot of red-ish LEDs and green laser lights, so if your concealer isn't working to cover up your pimple, don't worry, because nobody will see it in this place. The menu items were weird but I was open to trying something new. The price of the dishes was pretty high up there, but I didn't mind spending it to get a different experience. Or so I thought...\n\nOur party ordered Chongqing Chicken Wings, Kung Pao Pastrami, Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice cakes, and Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries (if I'm not mistaken). The portion sizes were not that big for the price - definitely not family-size. Each of the plates are individual-sized and rice is not included in the price. Since the prices were already pretty expensive, we didn't order any sides and only ordered water for drinks. Now for individual dishes...\n\nLet me start with the Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito with Cod Fried Rice and Fries. Yeah, so I thought each of those things would come seaparately - like it's 1 Kung Pao Pastrami Burrito, an 1 Cod Fried Rice, and a bowl of fries. At around ~$13, I thought it was a steal! Nope. EVERYTHING is in ONE burrito. The burrito was okay. I went there 2 weeks ago and already forgot, so not that memorable, but I remember it being okay.\n\nMoving on to the Thrice Cooked Bacon and Rice Cakes. Very greasy. Very salty. But tasty. Worth the price? At $16, I don't think so. The rice cakes are cut into little disks and the bacon cut into little squares. The bacon was very flavorful while the rice cakes were almost devoid of flavor except for the outside, so it balances the aggressiveness of the bacon flavor. But I felt that something was missing - the rice cakes were too bland. Like eerily bland on the inside. Other than that, it's an okay dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami. $16. Very Salty. It's also pretty good, but bite after bite, the saltiness will overthrow the balance of the taste.\n\nNow moving on to a diamond in the rough for this restaurant and the redeemer of my whole visit. Now, I like spicy food, but anything that will inflame body parts other than my tongue, I'm opposed to. The Chongqing Chicken Wings changed my mind. In the first bite, it was okay. Slightly spicy to the tip of the tongue. But a true feature of an excellent spicy savory food is the build of the spice. Yes, what I meant is that it will get spicier with every bite. This chicken does just that. The salt levels were on point, the sweetness is there, the spice builds to the point where I didn't realize that my mouth was going slightly numb. And the numbing feeling is surprisingly very fitting to the whole experience. It truly is sublime.\n\nAm I glad I went here? Yes. Would I go back here again? Probably not.

A little on the salty side though and I had no idea there was braised pork in it.\n\nMapo tofu: I never order this dish when I go out but I knew I had to get it here.  It was chunky and saucy.  Even the version without pork was delicious.\n\nThrice cooked bacon and rice cakes:  My second favorite dish of the night!  It has the same flavor profile as the mapo tofu (spicy, greasy, peppery) but the bittermelon offsets the intenseness.\n\nMongolian long beans: Even if you're craving vegetables, I would skip this dish.  It won't feel healthier because it's covered in quite a bit of grease and the flavor is intense.\n\nStir fried squid ink noodles: My FAVORITE dish of the night.  The squid ink noodles pairs perfectly with the lamb chunks.  I don't know how but it just does.  The lamb is so good even on its own.  This dish is a nice balance to the other very spicy and grease-laden dishes.  I overheard other tables say this was their favorite dish as well.\n\nEven though I really enjoyed the food, it's a bit heavy for me.  I feel like I've tried the most popular dishes but if there is a new, must-try dish, I'd consider coming back.

We were warned that Szechuan spice is different than spicy food we may be used to - it sort of numbs your mouth more than overtly burns it.  This is totally true, and these chicken wings will definitely do that to you.  They were dry-fried, which my husband loved, as he is a chicken wing aficionado and sometimes gets tired of the ones soaking in sauce.  Crispy, piping hot, and numbingly spicy as previously mentioned, these were a hit for my husband, and I liked them, but not as much as he did.

I read about MCF in Bon Appetit, so despite all the negative reviews, I had to come try it. We got here around 8:30pm on Sat night and ended up waiting over an hour. (That part sucked.) I will warn you that this place looks like a ghetto Chinese restaurant, but it does not serve ghetto Chinese food. The food is more fusion, and most of the people eating here are hipsters or non-Asians. I think initially that was a really big negative, since usually a sure sign of an ethnic restaurant being good is when _insert said ethnic group_ eats there. Like my brother said, \"I feel a little embarrassed to be the only Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant.\"\n\nBut if you set your expectations as coming to MCF to eat straight-up good food, not about coming to eat specifically Chinese food, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. That may be an understatement. \n\nMust gets:\n#1- Squid ink noodles. I guess they don't do to-go so it's not listed on their website menu. This dish was awesome. It's squid ink (thick) noodles with lamb, fennel, chickpeas, and onions. It also comes with a dipping sauce, which might have been some buttery lamb broth. I don't really care what it was, but if you're a big fan of lamb, you'll love this dish.\n\n#2- Thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes. Rice cakes with sweet tofu skin, pepper, and thrice cooked bacon. Really tasty, but the thrice cooked bacon was soft, not crispy, like I'd expect of something cooked thrice. Actually, it was kind of hard to distinguish between the bacon and the tofu skin in the dimly lit restaurant, since both were kind of soft and floppy.\n\n#3- Mongolian long beans. This is mandatory if you're one of those people that feel like you need a vegetable-heavy entree with every meal. It's spicy, but not burn-your-mouth-off spicy. It's a huge dish with lots of long beans, lots of other semi-edible vegetable parts, like ends of boy choy? Like I said, it's hard to tell what things are in the dark. \n\nSkip it/not sure what the hype is all about:\nLoser #1- Kung pao pastrami. Meh. The pastrami was really tender and salty, but it felt like the flavor completely clashed with the kung pao flavors of peanuts and heat. It wasn't by any means bad, but I just wouldn't order it again.\n\nLoser #2- Salt cod fried rice.

The eel itself was smoky and rich.  The Chinese celery added a nice crunch, but the celery was a little too pungent for the dish.  You definitely need to dip it in the soy sauce.  \n\nTIKI PORK BELLY: Kind of fusion-ish with the pineapple, coconut, and mandarin orange - like a tropical pork belly, with a little tiki umbrella and all. \n \nCHONGQING CHICKEN WINGS: Tons of red chilis on top, as well as chili oil - pretty explosive as they say.  The crispy beef tripe may actually be even better than the wings.  The spiciness can be numbing.\n\nSALT COD FRIED RICE:  Disappointing! I think this dish made it on the 7x7 list.  You can't really go wrong when you combine salted fish, chinese sausage, egg, and scallion with white rice.. unless there's essentially NO cod in the dish.

I rounded up 8 close friends who are as down to devour whatever lands in front of them as I am, and we set off on our \"Mission\" to the Mission to try out this spot.\n\nWe arrived to find a line outside the red glowing doorway, and we could just barely make out the sounds of the EDM/Dance/Trance soundtrack playing inside. The smells coming from inside were so ta filling, and my excitement grew with each sweep of the breeze that carried new aromas right to my nostrils. I couldn't wait for our new to be called, and just as I started to wonder when we'd get in, our table was called! \n\nId finally made it and I felt like I was entering hallowed ground as I passed through the doorway into the warm, dark and humid dining room, illuminated by glowing red lights and guarded by a giant golden Chinese dragon overhead. At first I was bothered by the temperature, wondering if id be able to enjoy my meal, but that quickly faded as I began to peruse the menu. The dishes here are like nothing you've seen before, bringing together traditional Chinese ingredients in some very inspired and non-traditional ways. \n\nAs a crew that likes to eat and drink, we had about 12-14 dishes on the table for the 9 diners, and by the end of it all, the carnage was something to behold. We ordered the Mongolian Long beans, stir fried with dried Asian chiles, Serrano chiles and chile paste, the Tiki Pork Belly exterior crisped to perfection and complimented by the unctuous and meaty interior and sweet sauce, 3X Bacon with Rice Cakes and Bitter Melon, Tiger Salad, Squid Ink Noodles, Cod Fried Rice, Sour Chili Chicken, Explosively spicy wings and more!\n\nMy favorite bit was the 3X Bacon, thin slices of lightly smoked pork belly served with chewy Chinese rice cakes and thinly sliced bitter melon, was an incredible bite of food. The bacon was thin but meaty with a light charcoal/hardwood smoked flavor that played really well with the bitterness of the bitter melon and spicy/savory/salty sauce and the rice cake added the perfect texture. I couldn't stop eating this combo throughout the meal. \n\nThe surprise of the night was the Tiger Salad. Described as simple and light by our server, this dish arrived and had us all confused. On a long plate stood three bundles of lightly dressed fresh herbs, ties together by wide pieces of chow fun rice noodles. They were roughly 3-4\" tall! The freshness of the salad was the perfect contrast to the rich and spicy dishes on the table, and I would suggest this as something anyone who comes should order.\n\nThe star of the night was the squid ink noodles, which are served with cumin spiced and charred lamb, harissa, a few fresh greens and a tangy yogurt sauce. As with a lot of Asian food, texture is important and the noodles added that beautifully. The ground lamb was delicate and delicious, providing a warm spice from the cumin, which combined nicely with a light heat from the Harissa. The surprise ingredient was the yogurt sauce, which rounded out and carried all of the flavors across your palate, bringing you back for more.  These are clearly freshly made noodles, and taking this to go would ruin their perfectly chewy texture, which is why it's only available dine in, and well worth waiting for!\n\nBite after bite of this spicy fare had me mopping my brow and downing glass after glass of reasonably priced, moderately cold, sake, which in turn had me focused on the next bite and forgetting about the warmth in the room. We passed dishes for what seemed like an enjoyable eternity, and when we examined our efforts, we all sat back satiated and smiling knowing Mission Chinese has left us much more to explore in a future visit. Tingly lamb face noodle soup, Kung Pao Pastrami, and so much more!\n\nOn a scale of one to hype, this place is all that and a bag of fried wontons!

Purely by chance, my gal pal and I got in this past Friday - when hundreds of thousands of hipsters were descending upon SF for Outside Lands! We came in around 1 pm and were seated immediately. Thank you, restaurant gods!\n\nI've eaten at Mission Chinese before, probably about 2 years ago. At the time, my palate was still getting used to SF cuisine and I wasn't a huge fan. If you come here expecting the traditional Panda Express fare (and trust me, I'm still a Panda fanatic), you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you show up with an open mind and tummy, prepare to be impressed.\n\nTwo people with normal appetites could easily split an entree or two, but since we were on vacay and don't often eat gourmet food such as this, we opted for three plates of food: Salted cod fried rice, egg egg noodles as well as spicy Mongolian long beans. Surprisingly, my favorite dish was by far the beans. They were pretty damn spicy, but not a \"oh shit, I'm going to have indigestion later\", more of a \"my mouth is slightly numb from the burn, but I can't stop eating\" feeling. I liked it. Second favorite was the noodle dish, minus the pile of jalape\u00f1os on top - an easy fix. Rice was also excellent (kudos to that butter flavor!), would order any of these again in a heartbeat. \n\nSince it was Friday, after 12 pm, and we were not at work, beer and sake were definitely in order.

I really liked how the dish had a slight kick and that the pieces of pastrami were so meaty.

The broth was light yet flavorful and the bowl was filled with generous amount of goodies.  However, again on a personal level, it was hard for me to get passed the cilantro.\n\n(If it wasn't clear already, I should note that I have a serious distaste for cilantro.  So in fairness, given that it was used in nearly every dish we had, it was hard for me to really fall for any particular dish regardless of how much I tried to set my bias aside.)\n\nOverall, I'd give the food THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of the service.  Although our server was attentive enough, she seemed to cop a bit of an attitude with one of my friends as we were putting in our order.

I am drooling just remembering this meal.\n\nOkay first up - chicken wings. We were warned that Szechuan spice is different than spicy food we may be used to - it sort of numbs your mouth more than overtly burns it.  This is totally true, and these chicken wings will definitely do that to you.  They were dry-fried, which my husband loved, as he is a chicken wing aficionado and sometimes gets tired of the ones soaking in sauce.  Crispy, piping hot, and numbingly spicy as previously mentioned, these were a hit for my husband, and I liked them, but not as much as he did.  I loved the texture, maybe the numbing was too much for me?  I don't know.  They're worth a try, though.\n\nEverything else, however, was perfection.

The food is more fusion, and most of the people eating here are hipsters or non-Asians. I think initially that was a really big negative, since usually a sure sign of an ethnic restaurant being good is when _insert said ethnic group_ eats there. Like my brother said, \"I feel a little embarrassed to be the only Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant.\"\n\nBut if you set your expectations as coming to MCF to eat straight-up good food, not about coming to eat specifically Chinese food, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. That may be an understatement. \n\nMust gets:\n#1- Squid ink noodles. I guess they don't do to-go so it's not listed on their website menu. This dish was awesome. It's squid ink (thick) noodles with lamb, fennel, chickpeas, and onions. It also comes with a dipping sauce, which might have been some buttery lamb broth. I don't really care what it was, but if you're a big fan of lamb, you'll love this dish.\n\n#2- Thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes. Rice cakes with sweet tofu skin, pepper, and thrice cooked bacon.

At my first visit over a year ago, the food was gratuitous, rich and just a little too salty - but over all really tasty. 2nd time I took my parents, bad mistake, as two 1st generation Chinese immigrants were appalled by what they considered a bastardization of their home cuisine. Though the food was tasty, it even saltier than the first time, to the point where we didn't finish a lot of the food. I'd give that visit 3 stars because the food was still palatable. \n\nBut these two visits are not why Mission Chinese is getting one star from me. Last night, I took some friends visiting here to enjoy some hip, fun chinese food and half the dishes were just seriously inedible even horrifying. \n\nWe got the Tiki Pork belly, which is always a safe bet at Mission Chinese, it's hard to go wrong with deep friend pork belly. It was solid, but as always a little too salty. You can't NOT skimp on white rice and water here, you will be punished. \n\nThen the Mongolian Long beans, another edible dish, it wasn't great but again it's nearly impossible to screw up. \n\nNext we got to the Sesame chicken, by this time everyone's tastebuds were experiencing some serious fatigue. Drinking water was such a good relief that it almost hurt. Sesame chicken was not noteworthy - I almost forgot we had eaten it. Thick crust, over cooked, barely any meat... again primary flavors: salt and sugar.\n\nBut the last two dishes are why I woke up with my throat swollen this morning, what made a pretty mediocre meal unforgettably bad, why I've probably lost dinner-picking rights among my friends and why I will never go back to Mission Chinese again. \n\nWe got the Vegan Dan-Dan Mein - again nearly impossible to screw up. The noodles came out swimming in this thick sauce, unlike any Dan Dan mein I've ever seen, more like noodle cornstarch soup. There was a hint something weird, herbal, tangy - almost a mix between lemon grass and pinesol that was in the noodles... not only do those two flavors NOT mix with food in general, they especially clash with the Ma La (numbing spice) that laced the Dan-dan mein. That combined with what must have been 500g of salt in this small bowl, the four of us couldn't get through 1/4th of the small bowl of noodles.\n\nFinally, the unforgettable Ma Po Tofu. I had nightmares about this. How the F*(#K do you screw up Ma Po Tofu that badly? Texturally the dish was okay and that's where the good things ended. There was Ma La again, which I expect to be in a good Ma Po, but then you get slammed with the salt and there's this indescribable chemical burning pain. The only thing I can compare it to is Potassium bitartrate filling the inside of your mouth. Don't ask me how I know but that's the closest feeling there is - if you want to try for yourself they sell Potassium bitartrate under the name Cream of Tartar in most grocery stores (have 911 on the ready) OR you could just try some of Mission Chinese's Ma Po Tofu for 10X the cost. At least you'll have a pretty red dragon gracing the saddest culinary atrocity in your life. \n\nSeriously we are not picky eaters, I'm Chinese and I clear my plates but we could not eat more than 3 small spoonfuls of the Ma Po Tofu. I just kept diluting that chemical sludge with more and more white rice until I realized I was just eating white rice at that point to try to end the pain. I want to emphasize that I grew up with Chinese peppers and Sichuan food, this was not the burning of chilies or Ma La... this was something else, much more sinister.

The crispy beef tripe may actually be even better than the wings.  The spiciness can be numbing.\n\nSALT COD FRIED RICE:  Disappointing! I think this dish made it on the 7x7 list.

It was fluffy and wonderful, delightfully salty, with bits of fish and sausage to add their meaty substance.  I also loved the thrice cooked bacon.  It was hefty with some great chew, and it was severely smokey in a way that I rather enjoyed.  One of my friends said it tasted like he was smoking a cigarette, but I don't think he meant that in a bad way.  The bacon came with bitter melon, tofu skin, chili oil, and plenty of floppy, supple Shanghainese rice cakes that moderated some of that strong flavor.  The tiki pork belly was another good dose of pig, a sweet one to counteract all the salt and smoke.  The pork belly was cooked soft and fatty with a soy caramel, and it came with mandarin orange, pickled pineapple, shaved coconut, and macadamia nuts.  The only overtly spicy dish we ordered was the Mongolian long beans.  These were quite spicy, but very enjoyable as a side.  They were a little bit doused in chili oil, but I liked the firm texture and the mix of Xinjiang spices and horseradish really delivered a kick.\n\nI washed down this feast with a $4 21st Amendment IPA, which hit the spot.

The pickles were delicious, almost like a Chinese kimchee. The pastrami, although unique, was on the salty side, especially when paired with an IPA. It was delicious and tasty but needed something sweeter to balance it out.\n\nSince I wasn't completely satisfied by the pastrami, I went back again for the brisket and broccoli and had to have the long beans again. This time was amazing...the dish had a lot more broccoli rabe than brisket, but it worked really well with the brisket adding a salty, smoky accent to the crunchy broccoli. \n\nThere's still the General Tsao's lamb ribs that I need to try so I'll be back my next time in San Francisco.

It's still worth going there once.\n\nService: I have had better luck getting take outs and delivery. Delivery has always been on-time (exactly 40-45 min), if not faster.

Bottom line -- if you can't handle spiciness, order non-spicy food on the menu.\n\nDishes: here are my reviews for each dishes I've ordered\n\nMa Po Tofu --- GET IT! unless you can't eat pork, which would be a huge shame. it's a very thick, savory sauce filled with soft tofu and pork chunks.\n\nBraised watercress --- interesting blend with pumpkin, peanut, and beans. I would count this as fulfilling enough as a standalone vegetarian entree. Healthy, too.\n\nBaby Bok Choy in popcorn broth --- I saw a review complain the broth was too bland. Not true. The broth was LIGHT flavored. I don't think it's supposed to be a heavy dish. It's just some nice chicken broth with bok choy. Very healthy and a good companion dish to ma po tofu.\n\nMongolian Long Beans --- spicy spicy spicy! But goooooood. A giant mound of spicy long beans will serve well as a standalone entree, if you can handle the hotness, that is.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami --- sorry, but this was a meh to me. I simply did not like the overly smoky flavor of the meat, and did not really find the blend of red peppers and peanuts to be all that interesting.\n\nWest Lake Rice Porridge --- a very standard, homey congee dish, as a congee shoudl be.\n\nTea-smoked eel --- the name was better than the dish.

Nothing else compares.\n\nYes, you may have to wait several hours for a table. Yes, that table may be cramped and/or shared with strangers. Yes, the service sometimes leaves something to be desired. But where else can you find such interesting, delicious food for such a low price? Mission Chinese Food is consistently the place that I recommend to out-of-town guests, and I happily eat here regularly.\n\nI haven't loved every dish that I've tried (e.g. I'm not a huge fan of the pork belly or sizzling cumin lamb, although I know several people who are), and there does seem to be some inconsistency in preparation between visits (e.g. sometimes the bacon is missing bitter melon), but overall, the food is always intriguing and it makes you want to keep eating. Even when your mouth is on fire from liberal use of szechuan peppercorn.\n\nIf you only get one thing, get the thrice cooked bacon without bacon. Trust me. The bacon detracts from the dish, but when you get it without bacon, they had more tofu skin, which gives you wonderful sweet, tofu skin-ny bites to contrast with the other flavors. The dish is also misnamed because it's really shanghai rice cakes with other stuff. This is the dish that I get every time I go.\n\nAfter the bacon no bacon, it's really up to you. The salt cod fried rice is delicious, so much better than any other fried rice that I've had; the westlake rice porridge is so comforting; the mongolian long beans WILL defeat you with their immense spiciness.\n\nJust go here and eat. No, it's not like any other Chinese restaurant that I've been to, and if you go expecting that kind of food, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

It was salty enough, but something was missing.\n\n*STEAMED EGG CUSTARD: A very light and simple dish with the addition of shaved scallops on top. The flavours didn't blow my mind but it was satisfying in a I-would-like-this-if-I'm-sick way. Portion-wise this was also a lot smaller than the other dishes and I barely noticed the confit chicken that was supposedly in there.\n\nI'll still come back to try all the other dishes that caught me eye if only to satisfy my epicuriosity.

"], "author": "Joy T.", "review": "I was lucky enough to eat half of their updated menu. Everything I ate was delicious and a few of the dishes were really and truly superb. \n\nAll MCF's ingredients are fresh, very fresh. They use all local produce and meats, and one can really taste the difference in a dish like Tingly Lamb Noodle Soup. The broth is clear; it's rich. The lamb tastes like lamb, but without a game-y aftertaste. The meat has no gristle. The soup is delicately spiced with raw, shaved ginger and scallions, which creates just enough brightness. He uses thick, hand-made Shanghai-style noodles, and the consistency is satisfying and chewy, not dough-y or sticky as hand-made noodles can be. \n\nI also loved the Char-Siu pork over rice noodles with shaved scallions and ginger... perfectly charred and sweetened pork without sacrificing tenderness. And the rice noodles are coated with shaved ginger and scallions and lightly topped with a sweet vinegar. It melds sour, tangy, and spicy while allowing the pork to be savory without erring on the side of salty. \n\nAnd the Salt Cod Fried rice is amazing. It just has to be eaten carefully.  It's a little different than the dish that inspired it, which is a classic Salty Fish Fried Rice. Traditionally, the fish is very salty and smelly, and mixed into the rice. But in this, he skips the smelly, and the cod is fried and placed as a whole piece on top of the rice. And this is amazing, because it's palatable for more people. \n\nThe key to getting all the flavors in this dish is to fill your spoon with a piece of the perfectly-prepared fish as well as some of the rice and sausage. Eaten this way, it's revelatory. The sausage is thinly sliced, because it's a traditional sweet sausage, meant to be a complement to the sweetness of the rice. And if you look at your spoon or notice what is happening texture-wise, you'll also see that the rice is broken-up to create that texture, which is a good way to get at how sweet the rice is all on its own. \n\nFinally, if the Szechuan pickles are the diced long beans in chile oil, then that is also, absolutely delicious. It's Chinese long beans, which are like a longer version of American green beans. They are cut-up and then soaked with thinly sliced chiles and chile oil. The final product is crisp and the chile is piquant. It's really, really good. And it actually reminds me almost exactly of the pickled sides I actually had in Sichuan, years ago.\n\nThe one thing about the place is that it was a little hard on my ultra-sensitive stomach the next day. But I'm a plain rice and veggie eater when I'm not going all out. So my suggestion is for any eater at MCF to think carefully about what you want, maybe ask if they'll comp you a bowl of steamed rice to go with your main dishes (if you get something like the Taiwanese eggplant, for example), and go slow. Eat spoonful by spoonful. The food is quality. It's authentic Chinese basics using great, local ingredients and prepared with care. And if you eat slowly and thoughtfully, you'll find you've never had a better meal. \n\nI thought my my meal was genius.

But we ended up picking items from just the MCF menu.\n\nVegetarian Delight - I barely even read this description, but they suggested it to us when they told us there were no pork dumplings and we still wanted soup.  First off, the name does not do it justice.  This is soup and not some mish-mash of veggies, which is what I would think based on the name.  It's three mushroom/veggie dumpling in this broth that was just out of this world.  A lot of times, I'm tempted to dump soy sauce or chili in broth-y soups cause they just don't have a lot of flavor.  Not this one.  This was not in-your-face-crazy, but rather a very delicate and yet super flavorful broth.  4.5 stars.\n\nTiger Salad - this was a bunch of herbs/greens stuffed in a rice crepe and then drizzled with chili oil.  A surprising burst of freshness and bold flavors that really woke up my taste buds.  I imagine this to be a staple for me.  Be warned though, it is very filling.  5 stars.\n\nTaiwanese Eggplant - I've never met an eggplant dish I didn't like, but I was a little underwhelmed by this.  It was good for sure, but maybe I was expecting amazing after the first two dishes.  3 stars.\n\nSizzling Cumin Lamb - wow.  Very stimulating to my eyes/ears (the smoke wafting from the sizzling goodness), nose (earthy, cumin/onion goodness), and mouth.  Oh the flavors and the texture!  The meat was very tender and although it was at times fatty, it was complemented by the crisp onions that soaked up all the cumin lamb flavors.  Yum!  5 stars.\n\nOverall - For all of that, it amounted to less than $40.  It really could have fed 3-4 people, but since I was soooo hungry, it only fed two of us.  But then again, I barely ate the rest of the day cause I was so full.  Definitely the value here is great.  Service though was just okay.  Granted, it was new year's day and apparently their regular people weren't working (it was the cook giving us our teapot, but forgetting the tea cups).

I should've known that when I realized I was the only Asian customer in the nearly 80% occupied restaurant.  My biggest issue was the excessive usage of chili pepper/jalape\u00f1o.  It made me wonder:  are they using the chili to mask the lack of depth in their dishes' flavors? \n\n1)  Slow Cooked char siu pork belly \n-The dish came with 5 pieces of pork belly beautifully cooked.  It's fatty and flavorful.  Unfortunately, portion was cut too big.  I felt sick after having half of 1 piece.  In other restaurants where I enjoyed similar dish, the meat would be cut more into a bite-size portion.  Tea-smoked egg was just okay.  The flavor was barely detectable after eating a couple of other [tongue-numbing] dishes.\n\n2) Salt Cod fried rice\n-one of the my two most-likable dishes of the meal.  Nicely balanced flavors.  When it first came out, cod pieces were too salty.  However, the left-over next day was much better.  Good 'day after' dish.\n\n3) Thrice cooked bacon\n-the bacon had a nice smoky flavor.  Rice cake was cooked well with a chewy bite.  Again, it was seasoned with too much chili oil that over-powered most of the ingredients.  When I was able to successfully uncover a single piece of a rice cake or bitter melon that's not overly covered by the chili oil, I was quite happy the original flavor combination (sans chili oil)\n\n4) Taiwanese eggplant\n-my favorite dish of the night.  Eggplant was cooked nicely with a wonderful balance of basil flavor.  I don't know how Taiwanese it was, but I'd say that was one dish more recognizable as Chinese food.\n\n5) 7 chicken wings with explosive chili pepper\n-imagine a large serving plate with 7 little wings on.  Then, pile on chili pepper after chili pepper until it resembles a small mountain.  To eat the wings, you have to fish them out under the big pile of pepper.  After you've consumed all wings, you wouldn't be able to tell that you didn't just simply order a large plate of chili pepper with nothing else.  Taste?  I doubt anyone tasted anything after their taste buds have been numbed by all the spiciness in all other dishes.  The skin was a bit dry & chewy... not in a good way.\n\n6) Sizzling cumin lamb\n-if I could imagine less chili oil, the flavors probably worked well.  Lamb could've been prepped more to minimize the strong \"lamb\" taste.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-10-10"}, {"excerpts": ["taiwanese eggplant - excellent\n\n"], "author": "Sumomo O.", "review": "This time ordered:\n1. pork belly - yum - pork is lean for belly, egg is medium-cooked;\n2. ma po tofu - reminded me of dishes I had in Szechuan - almost a soup with earthy, savory flavors, numbing Szechuan peppers;\n3. taiwanese eggplant - excellent\n\nAll very good.

Most of the group thought it was too weird (I didn't find the sweetness of the pastrami that distracting though).

It's hipster fusion pop-up food, with a small menu that's very good but not particularly great on taste.  \n\nAfter seeing the crowds waiting outside for two nights straight, decided to order in for delivery.  One cool thing is that they deliver...all the way out to the Sunset!  I highly recommend delivery over eating in so you don't have to stand in line.\n\nFood? We ordered the Beijing peanuts, the pickled vegetables, the Thrice Cooked Bacon, Westlake Rice Porridge and the broccoli beef cheek. I love Taiwanese-glazed peanuts! Unfortunately the Beijing peanuts were kind of nasty and gave me gas. Do not order.  Pickled vegetables were ok. \n\nThe Westlake porridge was good at face value but wished it had more of the oxtail and crab flavors in it.  The Beef cheek was a winner, not over-seasoned and fall off the bone fatty meat (I like my cheeks this way).  I thought the thrice cooked bacon with the chewy rice cakes and smoky flavoring was interesting and tasted pretty good and worth the order. \n\nFor these few dishes, it took about an hour to deliver and came to almost $60. For takeout, I think it's worth it as you won't find much unique Chinese like this for delivery. But is it worth the crowds and the waiting?

However while everyone else was still nursing their Thanksgiving food coma, my mom, dad and I dropped in for lunch the day after Thanksgiving. What do you know - there was no line!\n\nWestlake Rice Porridge oxtail, dungeness crab, soft-poached egg, cilantro\n\nThis was a sort of a hybrid between a Westlake beef soup and a traditional congee (rice porridge). The lineup of ingredients was an all-star cast so I had to order it. Served piping hot, small pieces of crab and oxtail were scattered throughout the bowl filled with bits of soft rice, strands of egg and a clear soup. The dish was fine, somewhat disappointing. I expected the oxtail and crab to play a more prominent role, maybe with a little bit of oxtail stock incorporated into the soup. In actuality, the soup was very mild in flavor and the oxtail/crab really didn't bring a lot to the bowl. Don't get me wrong, the soup was tasty but it didn't live up to its all-star cast of characters.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice escolar confit, chinese sausage, egg, scallion\n\nI thought this was another fun dish using salt cod instead of Chinese dried fish. Its effect was similar, adding a fishy flavor to the rice to pair with the sausage and aromatics. However, we all thought this plate was a bit heavy-handed with the salt.\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Soup Noodles cheung fun, mire poix, cardamom, turnip, broth\n\nWhereas the rice porridge was served hot amid wisps of steam, this soup was served warm. The brisket here was very tender and incredibly smoky, infusing the soup with that flavor. Rice roll noodles added some additional substance to the full-flavored dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami explosive chili, celery, potato, roasted peanut, steamed rice\n\nA familiar preparation of pastrami was stir fried kung pao style with something called \"explosive chili.\" I was fearful but actually found the heat to be present but not unbearable. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I thought there was a pretty decent balance of ingredients. My dad wanted more meat and less \"filler\" ingredients though.\n\nMy dad said this meal was definitely better than his previous experience, but the meal still did not live up to high hopes.

Slices of pastrami with explosive flavors of poblano and serrano chilis.\n\nAlso recommended:\n- Escolar and chinese salad\n- Chinese custard\n\nThings to note:\n- Cheap prices (accepts plastic)\n- Dress casual (think diner / dive style)\n- Get there before 6pm to avoid the line\n- No reservations\n- Don't be fooled by its awning - Mission Chinese Food is housed inside a pre-existing, old-style Chinese spot called Lung Shan.  \n\nAs Richman said, \"I think Bowien is a secret genius.\" I absolutely agree.

Atmosphere was definitely off putting on the smell alone, but the rest of the restaurant wasn't so great either. The whole establishment is dark and lit by lanterns with a giant dragon hanging overhead, which seemed over the top and tacky. Tables were also so close to each other that you can overhear other peoples' conversations and getting by around the restaurant was a hassle, along with probably being a fire hazard.\n\nThe worst part was probably the food. I used Yelp as a guideline on what to order and ended up getting the pork mapo tofu, broccoli beef brisket, and salt cod fried rice. Before anything else, THIS FOOD IS SALTY. The rice and brisket came almost immediately upon ordering which was surprising since the restaurant was busy and the tofu came about ten minutes after. The waiter and waitress who attended us were also pushy when we were deicing to order and asked if we knew what we wanted before we even sat down. \n\nThe pork mapo tofu was probably the most disappointing dish I have ever had, and I have had plenty of mapo tofu in my life. Upon first taste, the soft tofu with spice is delicious, but then the worst after taste comes immediately after. My boyfriend also thought the same about the dish; the tofu was nicely cooked but the sauce was unpleasant. It was spicy, but had a tangy aftertaste that burned the tongue in a strange way I had never experienced before. \n\nThe broccoli beef brisket was interesting, but had much too salt to actually enjoy it. The dish was mainly broccoli stalks with a skimpy portion of cubed brisket. There was a sauce that overpowered the entire dish to the point where the broccoli didn't taste like a vegetable and the beef tasted like a sauce sponge instead of meat. The idea of this dish is great, but poorly executed in a way where the flavors did not agree and work together. Less sauce and salt would have definitely done this dish some justice.\n\nThe salt cod fried rice was just ok. It reminded me of homemade friend rice, so it was nothing outstanding or great despite the multiple raves for this dish. Typically, salt cod fried rice lives up to its name of being salty rice dish, but with the tofu and brisket dish being so over flavored with salt and sauce, the rice tasted lacking. Salt does not equal \"flavor.\"\n\nOverall, this place is a complete miss. Parking was also a hassle on a weeknight so we had to park over 1.5 miles away, so definitely consider walking or taking public transit. I feel that the hype for this place gave me expectations that could have been met, but Mission Chinese Food dropped the ball. The food was also priced for the portions and quality, with most dishes being over $10 with messy presentation. Overly salted food, lack of service, and disgusting environment and atmosphere makes MCF a no-go for me.", "rating": 1, "date": "2017-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["I decided to order the Salt Cod Fried Rice since I haven't in a long time.

No onions, but there were lots of rice cakes, tofu skin, and some pieces of bacon.  There were also hot peppers and bitter melon slices, which I could've done without.

One piece was all meat and the other was all fat.\n\n- KUNG PAO PASTRAMI - Explosive Chili, Celery, Potato, Sweet Peppers, and Roasted Peanut...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#OiaERJDipb2u5Ku9mOsr2g)\nI don't usually get \"Kung Pao\" dishes, but this one was pretty good.  I really liked how the dish had a slight kick and that the pieces of pastrami were so meaty.  If it wasn't as salty as it was, this would have been a terrific dish.\n\n- SALT COD FRIED RICE - Mackerel Confit, Chinese Sausage, Lettuce, Egg...$11\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#xz7o_XqXfm7cY94Rp--e5Q)\nEven though I wish they left out the cilantro (not a fan), it was a solid dish for the most part.  The dish was well seasoned and the salt cod added just the right amount of salty/fishy flavor.\n\n- MONGOLIAN LONG BEANS - with Xinjiang Spices, Horseradish, and Chili Oil...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#oRiu_GaiMEyx4tzL-AKhJg)\nNot bad, but not great.  Although there was nothing wrong with the dish, it was hard for me to get excited because I just had a similar version at Hawker Fare in Oakland right before this one that tasted much better.\n\n- SMOKED BEEF BRISKEY NOODLE SOUP - Cheung Fun, Mire Pork, Bok Choy, Cardamom Broth...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-chinese-food-san-francisco-4?select=OxrqaLf5HrqFtwSrIk9UEA#7yebO14nZqr7UjkshUY44Q)\nLike the long beans, I was rather indifferent on this one.  The broth was light yet flavorful and the bowl was filled with generous amount of goodies.  However, again on a personal level, it was hard for me to get passed the cilantro.\n\n(If it wasn't clear already, I should note that I have a serious distaste for cilantro.  So in fairness, given that it was used in nearly every dish we had, it was hard for me to really fall for any particular dish regardless of how much I tried to set my bias aside.)\n\nOverall, I'd give the food THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of the service.  Although our server was attentive enough, she seemed to cop a bit of an attitude with one of my friends as we were putting in our order.  Still, I definitely want to come back to give their food another chance.\n\n\"Let me know when you want to go again - I'll show you the right things to get.\"\n\nNo pressure buddy, no pressure.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-06-27"}, {"excerpts": ["2) salt cod fried rice: if you are gonna advertise it as salt cod, please actually have salt cod.

So imagine the disappointment that consumed me after my first bite. This place is over-hyped and EXTREMELY OVER PRICED. My points of reference/comparison: I grew up eating home-cooked chinese food, dined in many of the chinese restaurants in SF Chinatown, Richmond, Sunset, and have resided in, and traveled throughout, China during college. \n\nThe ambiance/atmosphere. Imagine a hodgepodge of stereotypical Chinese decor (the dragon, the communist-era poster, the paintings of horses), dim/non-existent lighting except for a single eerie red bulb along with a string of Christmas icicle lights, in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant-esque Chinese restaurant, with 90s club/psychedelic music bumping in the background, staffed by hipster wait staff who speak perfect English. Oh and by the way, if you are unfortunate enough to be seated in one of the middle tables, be prepared to rub elbows and eavesdrop on your fellow diners. In summation, the environment was repulsive and offensive. \n\nThe food:\n\n1) pork belly (aka: hong shao rou): i don't understand why there was chinese new year coconut shaving on top of the two fatty piece of pork. and I really dont understand why there was a half slice of pineapple and a cocktail umbrella. The pork was extremely fatty, even for the belly cut, and it was overpoweringly salty. \n\n2) salt cod fried rice: if you are gonna advertise it as salt cod, please actually have salt cod. aside from that, I have no other complaints about this dish, it was done a-okay, but I have had way better chinese sausage/egg fried rice for a fraction of the price.  \n\n3) thrice cooked bacon with rice cake: let me re-name the dish for you, it should actually be called \"rice cake with a few small piece of bacon.\" This dish unnecessarily spicy, why? The \"bacon\" (aka lap yook) is a cantonese (southern) dish, and you will rarely (if ever) fine spicy food in canton. The entire dish consisted of stir fried rice cake (which is a Northern Chinese dish), interspersed here and there with a few small piece of \"bacon.\" There is a reason why there are both Northern and Southern Chinese cuisine...because the two should not mingle together! This is served with a side of exorbitant price.   \n\n4) the tea-eel wrap: this one gets points for creativity in concept, but it gets negative points for execution. The rice paper and the eel, fine. But who's idea was it to stuff it with celery leafs (the parts that you typically throw out!), which gives it a) a weird texture, and b) a nasty herb-y taste. \n\nTotal bill for 2 people with tips: 50 dollars. \n\nFYI: you can find the same (if not better caliper food) at almost any Chinese restaurant. just because you do not see fancy schamcy english names like \"thrice cooked bacon\" and \"salt cod fried rice\" does not mean they dont have it. Do yourself a favor, bring a friend who speaks/reads the language and have them order, you will realize that Chinese restaurants that charge a fair/cheap price serve more than coconut shrimp and kung pao chicken.", "rating": 1, "date": "2013-08-03"}, {"excerpts": ["Salt cod fried rice.

The bacon just added some salt and grease and nothing else. \n\nWe also ordered this dish based on its use of bitter melon, which we both enjoy. There was one piece in the entire dish. We told our server, who then made a comment about people not usually liking bitter melon. Hmmm okay. Well, we like them.

For those who are unfamiliar with cooking bitter melon, seasoning and a soften texture are needed to reduce the bitterness.

I will warn you that this place looks like a ghetto Chinese restaurant, but it does not serve ghetto Chinese food. The food is more fusion, and most of the people eating here are hipsters or non-Asians. I think initially that was a really big negative, since usually a sure sign of an ethnic restaurant being good is when _insert said ethnic group_ eats there. Like my brother said, \"I feel a little embarrassed to be the only Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant.\"\n\nBut if you set your expectations as coming to MCF to eat straight-up good food, not about coming to eat specifically Chinese food, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. That may be an understatement. \n\nMust gets:\n#1- Squid ink noodles. I guess they don't do to-go so it's not listed on their website menu. This dish was awesome. It's squid ink (thick) noodles with lamb, fennel, chickpeas, and onions. It also comes with a dipping sauce, which might have been some buttery lamb broth. I don't really care what it was, but if you're a big fan of lamb, you'll love this dish.\n\n#2- Thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes. Rice cakes with sweet tofu skin, pepper, and thrice cooked bacon. Really tasty, but the thrice cooked bacon was soft, not crispy, like I'd expect of something cooked thrice. Actually, it was kind of hard to distinguish between the bacon and the tofu skin in the dimly lit restaurant, since both were kind of soft and floppy.\n\n#3- Mongolian long beans. This is mandatory if you're one of those people that feel like you need a vegetable-heavy entree with every meal. It's spicy, but not burn-your-mouth-off spicy. It's a huge dish with lots of long beans, lots of other semi-edible vegetable parts, like ends of boy choy?

A friend had warned me in advance about the spicy items in the menu, just in case u can't handle the heat. I didn't feel like eating spicy food this time, so I didn't order those items (will try next time). Another tip: IF u order to go, don't forget to ask for utensils and napkins if u need them, otherwise u won't get any.\n\nPrices are not cheap, but 75 cents from every dish is donated to charity (SF Food Bank). Old news for those already familiar with the MSF concept. I have to admit that my first impression was that I preferred the old MSF creative menu better.\n\nAbout the food so far, in my opinion most dishes rate in the 3 to 4 stars range, some better than others.\n\nThe Peking duck chinito ($8) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1NybyuwRYYqkFJNYtaAbWg/l is a meat version of a HK dim sum item - duck meat inside a fried dough (\"yau tiu\" or \"oily sticks\" in Chinese) wrapped in a rice crepe (\"cheong fun\"), and served with hoisin sauce. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CP9KxPfb2GyJJ_4K8HcScg/l Nothing new for dim sum aficionados. - Verdict: it's just okay.\n\nThe salt cod fried rice ($10) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JIHAl3aA3FoBguVCmW3k1w/l is probably the most expensive fried rice I've ever paid for, but it's tasty and u get plenty of BIG chunks of tender fish as well as lots of sliced Chinese sausage. In a way it's like getting 2 dishes in one (deboned fish + fried rice), not bad at all. My favorite dish in the batch. - Verdict: thumbs up!!\n\nThe half roasted chicken ($9) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Es_aFnCVfwHN1ZT5Xa-RQ/l was the most generous portion-wise of all the dishes I've seen. It can easily be shared among 2 or more people, and it comes with a stir-fried rice with peanuts. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D6_-GVzaUwKOjY76JJCmpQ/l Great crispy skin on the chicken. The pristine grated ginger sauce was neat, and the burnt wine sauce (yes, not soy sauce) was interesting. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8yMWJLI6YmYOCTEmfINHEA/l Most Chinese restaurants have something similar - \"chuy pei cay\" or crispy skin chicken, New Hing Lung makes a very good version (way better). - Verdict: thumbs down.\n\nFor dessert there's a taro pannacotta with honey ($4). http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/35MfXhgCEgsUtsc9BOLGxQ/l I'm sure that it looks wonderful on a plate when dining-in, but the crisp cookies got soggy inside the container with the honey sauce. The taste (mild taro potato) and texture were fine, a good dessert. - Verdict: thumbs up!\n\nThe old dining room could use a remodeling. For me the the lure of the original MSF was the changing menu and creativity. I hope that they can occasionally add a new item to keep things interesting.

Tasty and refreshing. \n\n+ Szechuan Pickles: nice appetizer dish, lots of spice and kick, the peanuts are a great addition for taste and texture\n\n+ Tea-smoked eel: this is similar to the Tiger Roll in that you have some kind of veggie and, in this case, meat filling in a rice noodle roll.

The menu changes, but based on the one currently online, here are some of the answers: sea urchin, eel, cumin, and cardamom.  \n\nEverything was a combination of oily, salty, spicy, or sour, or all of the above.  If that sounds good to you, this is your spot!  \n\nTheir website is full of warning signs. Their logo is a rickshaw and there is a ninja delivering a flying kick across the middle of the page. That ninja kicked me in the face and flew away.  IT IS TAUNTING ME.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, what MCF has taught me is that if I didn't hear about a Chinese place from a fobby relative, I should expect my meal to be an expensive version of Panda Express.  I'm kidding.  That's not fair to Panda Express.\n\nWhat I can say is that food comes fast.  The six of us ordered a ton of things, and I can't remember them all.  Here's the breakdown, starting with the good stuff:\n\n26) SMOKED BEEF BRISKET SOUP NOODLES - $12\nCHEUNG FUN, MIRE POIX,BOK CHOY, CARDAMOM BROTH\n\nHands down the best dish of the night.  This was actually good and using cheung fun as the noodle was interesting.  I would love if they used hand cut noodle instead.  It couldn't quite redeem the experience, but if I had eaten only this dish, I would've come back for other dishes with high expectations.  It tastes like the pan-fried noodle soup at Turtle Tower (#6 Ph B\u00f2 \u00c1p Cho Nc) and Taiwanese beef noodle soup (niu ro mien) had a baby.  And that Taiwanese Vietnamese baby is MCF's smoked brisket soup noodles.  This is the only dish I'd come back for.  \n\n\nXX) PORK BELLY - $XX\n\nThis isn't on the website, so I don't have the exact menu info.  We had their pork belly with pineapple and cucumber.  It was pretty good but way too fatty.  One of the pieces of pork belly was pure fat, zero meat.  That's a ripoff.  And gross. \n\n\nXX) SHORT RIBS - $XX\n\nThis was okay; a few folks at the table complained that it was fatty, but my piece was tender off the bone and decent.\n\n\n21)    SHANGHAINESE CHOW MEIN - $12\nPULLED PORK TROTTER, ROCK SHRIMP, PICKLED MUSTARD GREENS, NAPA CABBAGE\n\nThis was one of the better dishes of the evening, and I feel like all it did was taste like chow mein from a decent Chinese restaurant.  Umm, good job?\n\n\n22) SALT COD FRIED RICE - $10\nESCOLAR CONFIT,CHINESE SAUSAGE, EGG,SCALLION\n\nThis one, I have mixed feelings about.  While the pieces of cod were larger than the traditional dish (a nice change), there was nary a Chinese sausage to be found in the fried rice.  Perhaps they forgot about it.  I don't have a problem with that.  But I ate a lot of salt cod and chicken fried rice growing up.  That was the dish I would order.  It's supposed to be small pieces of cod with pieces of chicken (in this case, sausage).  On its own... it seemed lacking.  This was also one of the better dishes... and this was just just average.\n\n\n16)   MA PO TOFU - $11\nGROUND KUROBUTA PORK SHOULDER,SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN, CHILl OIL, STEAMED RICE\n\nToo spicy and pretty sour.  Not much to say about this dish, because I don't really eat this one often. Enough to have had better. \n\n\n23) SIZZLING CUMIN LAMB - $13\nSALT & PEPPERED LAMB BELLY, CHILl-PICKLED LONG BEANS\n\nI ate this just because it had been ordered by our group.  The whole restaurant smells like this dish so it must be popular.  Cumin also smells that strong.\n\nSTEAMED RICE\n\nDry as the desert.  It tasted like day old rice, which is perfect for fried rice but not so great for steamed rice.\n\n\nCHICKEN WINGS\n\nStraight inedible. So, so salty.

Obviously focusing on the classics for my first bites of Bowien's cuisine it was with the \"3x Cooked Bacon\" that my tasting began and with a notable burn on my lips even as I avoided the whole Szechuan peppers the dish certainly shined - the pork's saline sapor juxtaposing bitter melon as discs of rice cake soaked up an elixir of fat, aromatics, and heat.  Moving next to salt cod, one of my favorite foods, served in the fashion of fried rice perhaps it was an effect of the dish that had preceded it or simply a case of inflated expectations but overall the whole plate tasted bland - a trend thankfully not carried over to the crunchy spring rolls who succeeded everywhere the rice had not as bold fish flavors played point/counterpoint with notes of smoke, saline, and sweet while raw vegetable added just enough texture to make the whole plate not only fresh, but also surprisingly light - something not exactly prominent elsewhere on the Mission Chinese menu.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-06-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The thrice cooked bacon and rice cakes, salt cod fried rice, and grandma's pork dumplings were delicious."], "author": "Jennifer W.", "review": "What you probably know already: started as a pop-up at Lung Shan Restaurant, but has taken over entirely, complete with flashing lights, loud music, and hanging dragon dance dragon.

No salt cod or hints of the mackerel confit. Something that should pack a punch with flavor. We sat there for a bit longer and looked through some photos of this dish on yelp and other sources which clearly showed that salt cod had been present in this dish once upon a time.\n\nI had never been served a dish before that left me so puzzled.\n\nWe waved down the waitress and asked her if this was indeed the \"Salt Cod\" Fried Rice or if we were given the wrong dish. She was quick to reply in the most unfriendly, condescending way and said this dish doesn't actually have pieces of salt cod in it and walked away. No care in the world about our experience at a restaurant that is supposedly one of the most important restaurants in America. \n\nThen in walks Danny Bowien himself. I glanced at him in disbelief and stared down at the \"salt cod\" fried rice, moving the rice to the edges of my plate as I'm still searching for this non-existent fish. As he walked by our table, a part of me so badly wanted to introduce myself and ask him to take a bite of this dish and see if he thought this was acceptable. Because I think he would say otherwise. \n\nWe also ordered the tea smoked eel, savory egg custard, and the tiki pork belly.

"], "author": "Michelle L.", "review": "Don't believe the hype! \n\nBy far the WORST \"Chinese\" food I've ever tasted in my entire life! Even Panda Express does a better job than this barf food I had.... My friends and I had such high expectations for this place, and we were beyond disappointed after the first bite. How can a restaurant that's on the 7x7 list, featured in several magazines, and has 1000+ reviews on Yelp taste that bad, you ask? It's all the hype - and please, don't believe in it. \n\nMy friends and I came on a Friday night (silly us) and waited for about 30-45 minutes in the cold (super windy night) with people pestering us for money. From the first glance of the store-front, I was kind of skeptical of the place. It was very grungy - and my belief was confirmed when I went inside to use the restroom. The restroom was straight through the kitchen and out the door. It was where the garbage and recycling bins were located, and right next to the kitchen. My initial thoughts were, \"use the restroom as fast as possible because rats and cockroaches can come out any minute!\" I mean, I didn't see any.. but you can only wonder....\n\nI also hated the interior of the restaurant. It was super dark and uncomfortable. My party had to share this medium size round table with 2 other parties, which was kind of awkward. I meant, I'm from HK and I'm used to this whole sharing table concept. But cramming us altogether with so little breathing room is not okay. When the food came out, we could barely distinguish our dishes with other parties' dishes. Not only that, but the table soon ran out of space to even accommodate all our dishes. Ugh... However, the most annoying part of the meal was that my party literally sat under the speakers, and they were playing loud, obnoxious KMEL-like music... Really, at a \"Chinese\" restaurant?? You have got to be kidding me. \n\nOkay, the most important part of the review... the food....\n\n1. Char Siu Pig Ear Terrine\nWeird texture and taste. What grossed me out the most was the little pieces of hairs still stuck on the pig ears... Even with the limited lighting, I could see those hairs stick up. Who would serve customers food with animal hairs still on it?? That's just disgusting.\n\n2. Tea Smoked Eel\nThis was a cool concept, but just didn't work. It would have been okay with just the rice noodle, eel, and celery, but there was this fishy tasting minced paste thing that just tasted like barf. I literally felt nauseous immediately after eating that. It was just a weird taste.. I don't even know what it was. I read the menu, and it says that there was \"braised pork\" in it.. but it definitely didn't taste like pork to me.... \n\n3. Salt Cod Fried Rice\nProbably the only dish that was \"acceptable\", and only because it didn't deviate too much from the REAL salted fish and chicken fried rice Chinese people traditionally make. However, given the quality of the food, it still wasn't very good as it lacked in flavor. I've had way better fried rice at Panda Express... But I'm glad we ordered this...since this was the only dish that was edible lol\n\n4. Egg Egg Noodle\nCame with a raw egg, which I think ruined the entire dish. How can they ruin such a simple dish? I think it literally consisted of noodles, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, and the raw egg. But it was just disgusting. I can't pinpoint why (weird texture and taste?), but I could only take 2 bites before putting it down. \n\n5. Kung Pao Pastrami\nWere they trying to kill us with that overly salty pastrami?? I've never tasted anything THAT salty... My friends and I were even joking about how this should be called \"Morton Pastrami\" given the extreme saltiness of the dish. I had one bite of the pastrami and couldn't handle it. Though I enjoyed the peanuts.......?\n\nMy friends and I ate about half (or less) of each dish and didn't even bother to take the leftovers home. It was THAT bad. I mean, I felt bad for wasting food like that and considered giving it to homeless people, but I think it would do more harm for them than help... Where are they going to find water to wash down that disgustingly salty pastrami? Worst $70 bucks ever spent on food. The table next to us also left half their dishes untouched and didn't take them home either.. That's saying something.\n\nI should've known this place would be a disappointment given that there were no Asians waiting in line to try this place. This place is super \"Hipsterized\" and gives Chinese food a bad name. I feel sorry for people whose first experience with Chinese food is at Mission Chinese Food. If this was my first experience, I would probably hate Chinese food. If you want REAL Chinese food, go elsewhere, preferably somewhere in Chinatown, Richmond, or Sunset.. NOT the Mission, and definitely NOT Mission Chinese Food. \n\nThe only redeeming factor about this place is that they donate 75 cents per entree to SF Food Bank.

One night we ordered a Tofu dish that was literally inedible due to the egregious amount of Sichuan (spelling?) Pepper that was put in it. I enjoy spicy food as well but couldn't take more than a couple bites before I had to tap out. I looked around and saw that no one else in the place was touching theirs either. In fact, there was so much pepper in those dishes that we noticed that everyone in the place was coughing whenever the oscillating fan blew the aerosolized pepper/toxin their way.\n\nOn the plus side though, when you order over the phone, you get the traditional hard core, limited-english speaker.

A bit salty though (as was *everything* on the menu). Also surprisingly light on the cumin flavoring (which was surprising, given the BOLD, INTENSE flavoring the rest of the menu seems to scream). Most people in the group like it.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami - I like pastrami and it was tasty, again a little salty. Most of the group thought it was too weird (I didn't find the sweetness of the pastrami that distracting though). However... it wasn't good enough for me to want to order it again.\n\nSzechaun pickles - ok, these were terribly one-dimensional, they basically blindly dumped vinegar, salt and sichuan peppercorns over cabbage.\n\nOverall... everything was overly salted (even one of my friends who likes to salt her ketchup said this was too salty and had to eat a lot of rice), and the flavor/ingredients weren't balanced well. Also surprisingly the heat level was very tame (despite all the red chili peppers they add... they've intentional made it very mild for our American palates... just like Panda Express).

I made a trip to the restroom upon arrival to wash my hands, which necessitates that you walk through a prep area. I thought it was funny to see a sign above the door in that room ordering \"Do not ask anyone in this room any questions.\" I guess that's their way of saying \"these guys speak Chinese.\"\n\nFood came out quickly, as it was ready. We ordered the Szechuan pickles--a spicy cabbage/carrot/peanut dish, served cold. It was interesting combo, and tasty. Our hot wings came out next. Served under a bed of chili peppers, they weren't especially hot, but definitely made your lips tingle a bit. Honestly, I'm not much of a wings fan and could have done without them--and because they are only 7-8 to an order, it wasn't a great buy. The salt cod fried rice was the perfect complement, though, balancing out the spice in the wings. The words \"fried rice\" do NOT elicit excitement for me, but it was amazing. Finally, the slow-cooked pork belly is divine--served with pineapple and cucumber for a sweet and sour taste. It has a crispy exterior but was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful.\n\nI had a Back in Black (21st Amendment Black IPA) and one friend also got a beer. For the three of us, with 3 entrees, an appetizer, and 2 beers, the total was just under $50.

The resulting dish did not achieve the normal tenderness of a slow-cooked pork belly, nor does it have the awesome smoky, savory-sweetness of a classic char-siu.

The beef was tasty, and we were pleasantly surprised to bite into a whole poached oyster, which adds so much richness to the dish.

Salt Cod is usually quite salty, but they did a great job toning down the salt here, and produced a tasty fried rice.  The rice was cooked well - dry but tender.

"], "author": "Marty R.", "review": "I find Mission Chinese to be a \"must try\" restaurant when visiting San Francisco.  It truly reflects what the 2011 San Francisco hipster strata is all about:  a creative, aloof, innovative, young, third world, fast-paced, laid-back melange of California urban culture mated with really good food.\n\nThis is not your grandmother's Chinese restaurant.  You see sesame seeds actually used here to add taste rather than texture.  I've been here twice with my husband, who loves spicy Chinese food.  I don't.  \n\nHe had the most provocative thing he saw on the menu, Kung Pao Pastrami.  Both of us thought it was really good.  But there's no way I could have eaten even a quarter of the whole dish because it was so spicy.  And you can't pick out the spices, either. They're everywhere mixed in with those aforementioned sesame seeds.  If you love spicy, it's definitely worth a try.\n\nThat same evening, I ordered the Salt Cod Fried Rice.  It was really tasty, and a large enough portion for three or four, but I wouldn't want to make a whole meal out of it.  The salt cod was perfectly prepared, moist and not overcooked.  The rice was flecked with lots of green onion and probably cilantro, and onions, I think.\n\nBut neither one of these dishes alone really makes a meal.  The pastrami came with a bowl of rice, but still the meal was off balance, not enough greens.  So to try to balance it, I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles.  Cool, cucumbers, peanut sauce, greens, etc.  But labeled as a 'small plate', it was still too large to match with the other dishes without having a slough of leftovers.\n\nUnfortunately, we got no guidance from our server.  She was barely interested in our presence at the table.  She didn't seem to be too interested in anything, so it wasn't like she was distracted.\n\nI find it interesting that the so-called \"hipsters\" who love to slam a restaurant for poor customer service and bad food (see previous reviews below) are also from the very same ilk who provide it.  Maybe it's a generational thing.  But the service at Mission Chinese is cold and nonchalant at best.  This is something (social skills) they need to work on instead of their tattoos.\n\nOur second visit garnered a better result for me.  Husband again ordered the pastrami.   I ordered the 'small plate' fried pork belly with noodles and cucumbers.  I thought it had all the elements I was looking for in the description.  But this time, the server cautioned me that this was more of an appetizer and that I might find it wanting more.  So taking her advice I ordered a 'small plate' Hainam Chicken Fried Rice.  It came first.\n\nIt was good, but again, it wasn't a meal.  Bits of chicken mixed with fried rice, a bit of chicken fat for flavor and some vinegar to cut the greasy feeling.  I'd order it again, but I was anticipating the pork belly appetizer.  \n\nThis is where I should have started.  It was remarkably good.  The pork belly was fried to the point of caramelization on the outside and it was like butter on the inside.  Eye-rollingly good.  It came resting upon some wide rice noodles rolled up with cilantro and scallions, a few pickled cucumber slices, a soy cured 'soft boiled' egg and hoisin sauce.  Yum!  This was everything I was looking for and I would have been very satisfied (and had more change in my pocket) if I had ordered only this.\n\nBoth times, I topped it off with their Ginger Beer from Australia.  I love it.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, make sure you take a trip to the restroom at the back of the restaurant.  You get to walk through the food staging area, see huge cuts of barbecued beef, lamb, pork prepared expertly, workers checking their iPads for orders and reviews (I surmise) and finally arrive at an adequately clean (for a very busy small restaurant) out the back by the dumpsters, where the air is amazingly refreshing.\n\nThis place could certainly benefit from a nicer piece of real estate, but I think that would somehow cheapen the whole experience.  This is raw San Francisco - heart of the Mission District, heart of the economic crisis from which it sprang (good out of work cooks looking for a cheap way to ply their wares) and really innovative food.  Be sure to check out the beer cans resting in the jaws of the giant dragon suspended from the ceiling.  \n\nOh yeah, and if you're in a hurry, tell them you're willing to share the big table at the back.  Just be prepared to experience the loud rap and hip hop music emanating from the ghetto buster iPod in the back.  Remember, this is not your grandmother's Chinese restaurant.

Now if I were not of Asian descent I could see how this place is spectacular to the unasian tongue but having eating food all over Asia and even china town...this isn't the best and does some injustice to a lot of Chinese restaurants in the bay area which are comparable and even better without all the fanfare.\n\nDishes ordered for two people...\n\nSalt cod fried rice - you can find this at every Chinese restaurant and nothing was really different.

Although the dish wasn't labeled as spicy they did have sliced jalapenos mixed in with the onions.  Best dish for the night\n\nFried chicken wings covered in chili peppers - I really liked this dish even though the flavors were the same as other Szechuan restaurants but they actually fried whole chicken wings.  Traditionally all other restaurants that make this dish cut up the wings in small pieces without a whole lot of meat.\n\nSzechuan pickles - good, but ordinary \"pao tsai\"\n\nTea smoked Eel - Something about this dish that just didn't work for me.  Either the Eel was too heavily smoked in Eel or the taste of hoisin sauce that just messed with me.

Arriving at a little after 7 PM on a Tuesday evening, we stood outside with the crowd on the street and waited for 45 minutes as assorted homeless indigents encouraged us to \"help them out\". When our table was ready, we found the interior of the restaurant to be somewhat dilapidated and decorated in a weird mish-mash of cheap Chinese restaurant decor (a few red \"scrolls\" and lanterns), Chinese gift shop (specifically, the extra-large blow-up dragon hanging from the ceiling) with a college dorm room (namely the white Christmas lights strewn around the restaurant). On top of that, they play hip hop not too inconspicuously: chowing down while listening to Bone Thugs and Ludacris, I was left unsure as to whether or not I should be getting up and busting a move.\n\nFood items:\nBeer-brined Sichuan pickle: pickled napa cabbage that was moderately salty and just a little sour from the beer, a decent starter that would've been better with rice.\n\nSmashed cucumbers in garlic sauce: essentially fresh smashed small cucumbers served with garlic hummus and fresh minced chilies. Delicious, but only vaguely Chinese.\n\nTiger salad: some assorted bitter greens encompassed by a single layer of wide rice noodle, with a mostly unidentifiable and totally forgettable vinagrette (?). I feel somewhat ashamed for having ordered this, but to our credit, some prior Yelp pictures had us mistaking this for the beer-brined Sichuan pickle.\n\nSavory egg custard: a new dish per our waitress, it is essentially a egg custard (almost like a chilled version of what you get at Korean BBQ) served in tomato water with a decent amount of uni, trout roe, and minced shiso leaves. Separately, all these components are actually delicious. Together, they formed a cold hodge-podge with no common element, a sum that is less than the individual parts.\n\nSliced peanut noodles: perfectly cooked wide rice noodles served with a slightly watered down peanut sauce. I like my peanut sauce actually heavy on the peanut, but the effective cooking of the he-fen left me envious.\n\nThrice cooked bacon: holy cow, is this dish smoky. Crispy and yet not completely dried out pieces of chewy bacon are stir-fried with slightly numbing chilies, thin slivers of bitter melon, all in chili oil. A potent combination that was hard to resist picking at even when full.\n\nSizzling cumin lamb: for those of you who cannot handle gamey meats, this dish brought the barnyard along with the lamb on the plate. The meat is certainly tender and well prepared, at least. I was looking for a heavier hand with the cumin; I may in fact stir-fry my leftovers with more cumin.\n\nSalt cod fried rice: our favorite dish of the night. A very delicately prepared (if that is possible for fried rice) dish with good balance of salt, sweet from the chinese sausage, and starch with just a tiny shred of lettuce to keep it tasting slightly fresh. It honestly reminded me of late nights of post-clubbing Chinese food back in Boston, a cleaner and less funky version of salted chicken and fermented fish fried rice served in venues like Chow Chau City.\n\nVerdict: apparently we came to this restaurant looking for Chinese food, and what we found was...50% something else. At over $40 a head for this level of meh (even though we have a boatload of leftovers), I'm actually very surprised that Danny Bowien won the James Beard for Rising Star Chef.

I didn't get a chance to try any (or see any of it), but the words \"terrible\" and \"awful\" were both used in their description of the food. I was totally shocked, but I knew I'd have to try it myself.\n\nNot surprisingly given the hype, lines are a frequent occurrence outside the no-reservation restaurant; there must've been at least 20 people waiting outside this past Saturday night at 9pm. However while everyone else was still nursing their Thanksgiving food coma, my mom, dad and I dropped in for lunch the day after Thanksgiving. What do you know - there was no line!\n\nWestlake Rice Porridge oxtail, dungeness crab, soft-poached egg, cilantro\n\nThis was a sort of a hybrid between a Westlake beef soup and a traditional congee (rice porridge). The lineup of ingredients was an all-star cast so I had to order it. Served piping hot, small pieces of crab and oxtail were scattered throughout the bowl filled with bits of soft rice, strands of egg and a clear soup. The dish was fine, somewhat disappointing. I expected the oxtail and crab to play a more prominent role, maybe with a little bit of oxtail stock incorporated into the soup. In actuality, the soup was very mild in flavor and the oxtail/crab really didn't bring a lot to the bowl. Don't get me wrong, the soup was tasty but it didn't live up to its all-star cast of characters.\n\nSalt Cod Fried Rice escolar confit, chinese sausage, egg, scallion\n\nI thought this was another fun dish using salt cod instead of Chinese dried fish. Its effect was similar, adding a fishy flavor to the rice to pair with the sausage and aromatics. However, we all thought this plate was a bit heavy-handed with the salt.\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Soup Noodles cheung fun, mire poix, cardamom, turnip, broth\n\nWhereas the rice porridge was served hot amid wisps of steam, this soup was served warm. The brisket here was very tender and incredibly smoky, infusing the soup with that flavor. Rice roll noodles added some additional substance to the full-flavored dish.\n\nKung Pao Pastrami explosive chili, celery, potato, roasted peanut, steamed rice\n\nA familiar preparation of pastrami was stir fried kung pao style with something called \"explosive chili.\" I was fearful but actually found the heat to be present but not unbearable. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I thought there was a pretty decent balance of ingredients. My dad wanted more meat and less \"filler\" ingredients though.\n\nMy dad said this meal was definitely better than his previous experience, but the meal still did not live up to high hopes. I thought the food was \"just okay\" (definitely not awful), with flavors not really coming together as well as I had wanted. The menu is incredibly intriguing, integrating Chinese food with Western techniques and ingredients. I so badly want something like this to succeed and elevate Chinese food on both the local and national scene.

SOOO... we drug 6 of our colleagues out into the Mission to dinner around 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  Thankfully we were high on the list and the nice host agreed to seat us pretty quickly even though two of our folks were walkign form the BART station at Mission/19th.  We sat at one of the large tables in the center and our ever so charming host got us drinks quickly and then walked us through a list of \"must tries\" for us to enjoy family style.  The interior was as expected, funky and dark with club music playing in the background which got mixed reviews from our crowd (I loved it and others described it as maddening - lol).  The good thing was that as it grew darker outside, the interior was brighter.  We ordered the following and shared and had the associated impressions:\n\nVinegar Peanuts - Yummy and vinegarry while still crunchy (hone your chop stick skills young Jedi!).\nTea Smoked Eel - AMAZING - I am a huge eel fan and the dumpling wrap was awesome and the seasongin of the eel was not overpowering.\nPork Belly - YUM YUM YUM.  Not too fatty with a good \"rind\" on it.  It was a melt in your mouth not too salty experience\nMa Po Tofu - Really good an da favorit of more than one.  The tofu was a little slimy fo rme (but that's tofu) but the spice was magical!  Not too much just enough to make it interesting.\nKung Pao Pastrami - Patrami was so tasty - the amount was fine it was not greasy.\nBroccoli Beef Brisket - Amazingly tender brisket with tons of CHinese broccoli in a good sauce.  REally nice annise notes.\nSalt Cod Fried Rice - Yummy though nothing really crazy good.  I couldn't really discern the taste of the salt cod.\nSquid Ink Noodles - SO GOOD!!!  The noodles are HUGE and were very well cooked and were quite tasty.  Not sure if there really was any add from the ink but it was really tasty and enjoyed by all.  \nLong Beans - AWESOME but VERY SPICY!!!  I got a jalapeno by accident and WOO HOOO.  \nThrice Cooked Bacon with Rice Cakes - The bacon in this was SOOO nice and the small rice cakes were awesome (think quarter or 50 cent sized discs).\n\nAnd the best part we had 8 folks for dinner who drank beer and the tab was a little over $200!!!!!  This was an amazing feat and everyone enjoyed it massively and we were all absolutely stuffed.\n\nIn conclusion - take this for what it is... a very positive review from someone that can be picky but that can also embrace a TWIST on a particular type of food (be it nouveau southern, fusion, whatever).

Everything I ate was delicious and a few of the dishes were really and truly superb. \n\nAll MCF's ingredients are fresh, very fresh. They use all local produce and meats, and one can really taste the difference in a dish like Tingly Lamb Noodle Soup. The broth is clear; it's rich. The lamb tastes like lamb, but without a game-y aftertaste. The meat has no gristle. The soup is delicately spiced with raw, shaved ginger and scallions, which creates just enough brightness. He uses thick, hand-made Shanghai-style noodles, and the consistency is satisfying and chewy, not dough-y or sticky as hand-made noodles can be. \n\nI also loved the Char-Siu pork over rice noodles with shaved scallions and ginger... perfectly charred and sweetened pork without sacrificing tenderness. And the rice noodles are coated with shaved ginger and scallions and lightly topped with a sweet vinegar. It melds sour, tangy, and spicy while allowing the pork to be savory without erring on the side of salty. \n\nAnd the Salt Cod Fried rice is amazing. It just has to be eaten carefully.  It's a little different than the dish that inspired it, which is a classic Salty Fish Fried Rice. Traditionally, the fish is very salty and smelly, and mixed into the rice. But in this, he skips the smelly, and the cod is fried and placed as a whole piece on top of the rice. And this is amazing, because it's palatable for more people. \n\nThe key to getting all the flavors in this dish is to fill your spoon with a piece of the perfectly-prepared fish as well as some of the rice and sausage. Eaten this way, it's revelatory. The sausage is thinly sliced, because it's a traditional sweet sausage, meant to be a complement to the sweetness of the rice. And if you look at your spoon or notice what is happening texture-wise, you'll also see that the rice is broken-up to create that texture, which is a good way to get at how sweet the rice is all on its own. \n\nFinally, if the Szechuan pickles are the diced long beans in chile oil, then that is also, absolutely delicious. It's Chinese long beans, which are like a longer version of American green beans. They are cut-up and then soaked with thinly sliced chiles and chile oil. The final product is crisp and the chile is piquant. It's really, really good. And it actually reminds me almost exactly of the pickled sides I actually had in Sichuan, years ago.\n\nThe one thing about the place is that it was a little hard on my ultra-sensitive stomach the next day. But I'm a plain rice and veggie eater when I'm not going all out. So my suggestion is for any eater at MCF to think carefully about what you want, maybe ask if they'll comp you a bowl of steamed rice to go with your main dishes (if you get something like the Taiwanese eggplant, for example), and go slow. Eat spoonful by spoonful. The food is quality. It's authentic Chinese basics using great, local ingredients and prepared with care. And if you eat slowly and thoughtfully, you'll find you've never had a better meal. \n\nI thought my my meal was genius.

If you're adverse to fat or have existing heart conditions, it may be wise to stay away from this. If not, this is melt-in-your mouth, party in your pants awesomeness. I've had better at traditional chinese places, but this is a pretty well done dish. Good to share with a few people. The Salt cod fried rice was done perfectly. Not too stinky and salty from the salt cod, a really great balance of scallion, eggs, chinese sausage. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The egg-egg noodles took me by surprise. They give you a raw egg yolk to mix in with the egg noodles, which gives it a richer, creamy texture. The dish is heavily gingered, but they do it in a way that is really successful. The thrice cooked bacon with Korean rice cakes was probably my second favorite dish. The bacon was salty, a little crispy and so well done. The addition of the rice cakes was a perfect vehicle for the spiciness of the dish. It's exactly what I needed. \n\nAnd now we enter the second half of the review, which deserves a name of it's own: \n\nWELCOME TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL. \n\nChongqing Chicken Wings. No dish has ever left such a lasting impression on me, maybe in my life. It lasted the entire rest of the meal, the rest of the night, and the following morning. This dish is not for the light of heart, the light of spice, and the light of HOLY BALLS WHY!? These wings are pretty heavy in Chinese 5 spice, which can be a little off-putting for those that aren't used to it. When you bite into them, you'll notice that they're well fried, and incredibly fragrant. Then your lips start to tingle. Then your mouth goes numb. The wings are coated with Chinese numbing spice, better (or maybe not) known as Sichuan flower peppers. It's an incredibly intense experience and I don't know if I've ever had my face literally go numb from spice. On the plus side, the wings are an incredibly flavor enhancer. Eating the noodles, the thrice cooked bacon, and the salt cod fried rice directly after eating the wings, made each food even more amazing. It was absolutely remarkable, it was like we were eating three completely different dishes. \n\nThen came the Mapo tofu. Now, I am a student of spice. I grew up with a father who loved to cook Sichuan style and grew his own Thai hot peppers. This Mapo wasn't the best I've ever had, but it's definitely worth giving a try. It's a little salty, so I suggest having some white rice around to help balance out the saltiness and spice of the dish. Maybe it was because of the Devil wings we just ate, but on medium spiciness, we were dripping in sweat, which in my case was spreading the spiciness across my face and thereby producing a numbing sensation. What the mapo lacks in balance of salt and spice, it makes up for in flavor. It's a pretty fragrant mapo dish and uses chunks of pork shoulder which fall apart in your mouth. I might get this again, but probably without the chicken wings. \n\nOverall, I give Mission Chinese a 4/5 because I would definitely go back, I would probably order most of the things I got again, but there are ton of really great items on the menu that I really want to try.

The wait is long but if you manage to get a table order as much food as your body can hold at one time.

On my second try I found myself in a state of euphoria after indulging in so many fatty foods I thought my heart would explode from happiness.

It sounds like something I would like.  Ultimately, the food is average and the twist under delivers or is just way out of left field.\n\nWe started with the Mouth Watering Chicken (an aside: the literal translation is Saliva Chicken, so I'm glad they modified the name).  It had the typical spicy and numbing elements to it.  The chicken hearts were all cooked a little differently (one was still bloody in the middle while most were cooked through).  Ok dish.\n\nNext was Chicken Wings with Explosive Peppers (aside number two: explosive is a ridiculous term for food and it just reminds me of explosive ...).  This is a take on \"la zi ji\" (sorry if my pinyin sucks).  Some Szechuan dishes are some meat deceptively covered in a mound of red peppers.  The dry (non soup) versions typically aren't that spicy and this dish was no different.  The meat in this case was fried chicken wings with a healthy dose of black pepper.  Again, nothing special.  Take away the peppers that are really for show and you're left with black pepper chicken wings.\n\nOur next three dishes were my favorite three dishes of the night.\n\nBroccoli Beef Cheek - The oysters in the dish were a real surprise as I clearly didn't read the menu correctly.  Every component of the dish was really tasty (Chinese broccoli, beef cheek, oyster) but the oysters still seemed really random.\n\nPork Belly - Crispy skin and super fatty.  Really good with spicy marinated pineapples.  I devoured my portion, but my friends had mixed reviews.\n\nSmoked Beef Brisket Beef Noodles - Delivers on both beefy and smoky.  Maybe a little too smoky, but still good.\n\nThe last dish arrived late.  We had pretty much finished off the other dishes by the time it arrived, but it would be worth it, right?

Maybe this was the healthy version (less oil, less salt)?\n\nAll in all, I'd give the food 2.5 stars.  The swing to two stars comes from the following:\n- This place is pretty much always busy.  That means a line to get in and everyone is packed in like sardines.\n- Our table had spatterings of rice from the previous diners.  There was a baby at the table and a small bowl's worth of fried rice on the ground where he had been sitting.  Can't say I blame the baby.  When we left, the hostess took about 5 seconds and 3 wipes of the table to \"clean\" it.\n- It's very loud in the restaurant with the amount of people and music playing.  The dim lighting also makes it hard to see things, but that could be a good thing.  Some things we don't want to see.\n- We had to remind the wait staff of our last dish and it took a while for it to come out.

The noodle soup was too \"fusioned\" out for us. It tasted so smoky, without any good quality, since it was a soup.

We have tons of wine left over from a recent party so I thought it would be nice to take a bottle or two.  I called to ask and received a long 10 seconds of \"uuuummmm\" from the guy who answered the phone.  He put me on hold to ask someone else and came back with \"no you can't bring your own wine\".  I thought that was odd, so I looked back on Yelp reviews and sure enough just 2 days prior there was a review saying that they brought their own wine.  Naturally I called back to confirm.  Same guy - \"Uuummmmm, well, I don't know.  Wait hold on.\".  He passed on the phone to someone else.  I, very nicely and politely said \"Hi\" and got cut off by a very RUDE \"Yeah, do you have a question because we're really busy right now..\"  What the..!  Anyway, I did have a question, which I asked and sure enough you can bring your own wine with a minimal corkage fee.  Fine.  On to Mission Chinese.  At least the food is good.\n\nWe ordered what we loved before: Tiger Salad and Salt Cod Fried Rice.  We had the Cumin Lamb on our first visit, but it was really a plate full of sauteed onions and 4 meager pieces of lamb.  Good flavor though.  We were torn between the Beef Cheeks and Corned Beef and asked our waiter what he thought between the two.  He was CLEARLY annoyed by the question. He was like \"well, both are good...it depends on what you want.\"  Really?  That's your response??  Seriously?  Anyway, we went with the Corned Beef.  Although tasty, it was a plate full of potatoes and a few slices of corned beef.  Why so stingy with the meat, Mission Chinese?  Oh, and we didn't get a serving spoon with our Salt Cod Fried Rice.  When asked for one, a fork was literally dropped on our table 5 minutes later.  \n\nI would've given one star, but the Salt Cod Fried Rice bumped up the rating.

I should've known that when I realized I was the only Asian customer in the nearly 80% occupied restaurant.  My biggest issue was the excessive usage of chili pepper/jalape\u00f1o.  It made me wonder:  are they using the chili to mask the lack of depth in their dishes' flavors? \n\n1)  Slow Cooked char siu pork belly \n-The dish came with 5 pieces of pork belly beautifully cooked.  It's fatty and flavorful.  Unfortunately, portion was cut too big.  I felt sick after having half of 1 piece.  In other restaurants where I enjoyed similar dish, the meat would be cut more into a bite-size portion.  Tea-smoked egg was just okay.  The flavor was barely detectable after eating a couple of other [tongue-numbing] dishes.\n\n2) Salt Cod fried rice\n-one of the my two most-likable dishes of the meal.  Nicely balanced flavors.  When it first came out, cod pieces were too salty.  However, the left-over next day was much better.  Good 'day after' dish.\n\n3) Thrice cooked bacon\n-the bacon had a nice smoky flavor.  Rice cake was cooked well with a chewy bite.  Again, it was seasoned with too much chili oil that over-powered most of the ingredients.  When I was able to successfully uncover a single piece of a rice cake or bitter melon that's not overly covered by the chili oil, I was quite happy the original flavor combination (sans chili oil)\n\n4) Taiwanese eggplant\n-my favorite dish of the night.  Eggplant was cooked nicely with a wonderful balance of basil flavor.  I don't know how Taiwanese it was, but I'd say that was one dish more recognizable as Chinese food.\n\n5) 7 chicken wings with explosive chili pepper\n-imagine a large serving plate with 7 little wings on.  Then, pile on chili pepper after chili pepper until it resembles a small mountain.  To eat the wings, you have to fish them out under the big pile of pepper.  After you've consumed all wings, you wouldn't be able to tell that you didn't just simply order a large plate of chili pepper with nothing else.  Taste?  I doubt anyone tasted anything after their taste buds have been numbed by all the spiciness in all other dishes.  The skin was a bit dry & chewy... not in a good way.\n\n6) Sizzling cumin lamb\n-if I could imagine less chili oil, the flavors probably worked well.  Lamb could've been prepped more to minimize the strong \"lamb\" taste.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-10-10"}, {"excerpts": ["The two exceptions so far have been the Szechuan pickles, which are neither as spicy nor flavorful as I'd expect, and the Salt Cod Fried Rice, which is delicous but needs a little more salt cod in my opinion.

Some things are *spicy* but not the hottest food I've ever eaten, but timid eaters beware. Here's the secret to enjoying Mission Chinese...either live in the Mission or have a friend who does and order delivery. It's free within most of the Mission a couple of bucks further out. You avoid the long wait outside, the dicey interior and any perceived staff snubs (I've found them to be friendly both on the phone and when ordering for takeout at the restaurant). Another plus, you can have a nice bottle of wine with your meal. As for those who say meh or \"average Chinese\" I'd love to know where you normally eat. This is very unusual (and unusually good) \"Chinese\" food -- unlike any other that I've had in SF, LA or NY.", "rating": 5, "date": "2013-03-30"}, {"excerpts": ["i eat mostly veg dishes) : salt cod fried rice, the ma po tofu (not veg but AMAZZZZZZING), tiger salad, seaweed salad, and last the BEST DISH OF ALL taiwanese eggplant!!!!

Outside, the marquee says \"Lung Shan Restaurant,\" but inside, the heart and soul of the restaurant is the famous Mission Chinese Food.

What??\n\nAnd then there's the menu. Some of the items may have a Chinese food-sounding names, but the descriptions are anything but! We started with the spicy sichuan Kimchi in spicy macadamia oil and the amazing fried Westlake lamb dumplings served with tzatziki sauce and spicy chili oil! The lamb dumplings were a standout for me--the flavor of the lamb somehow went so well with the creamy tzatziki sauce, and the chili oil gave everything a spicy-numbing tinge.\n\nNext, we had the cabbage cooked with pistachio milk, which was a nicely seasoned vegetable dish, as well as the Mongolian longbeans, a huge platter of fried beans with horseradish and Sichuan peppercorns. The matcha meyer lemon noodles were just as interesting as the name sounds--the noodles sat in a matcha-infused broth and were dressed with cucumber, radish, and herbs. But the definite favorite dish of our group was the lamb and squid ink pappardale. The thick strands of black pasta were perfectly al dente and had the most amazing texture, and they were complemented with tender pieces of lamb shoulder, along with harissa yogurt, fennel, onion, and watercress. The flavors of the dish were reminiscent of a Chinese stir-fry (\"wok-hay\"), but the dish also had a distinctly Mediterranean/Italian feel--fascinating!\n\nIndeed, Mission Chinese was a cool, memorable experience.
