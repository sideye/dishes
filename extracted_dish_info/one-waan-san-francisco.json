I ordered the Tom Tamarind soup (comes with our exes of white meat chicken); one of the most flavorful soups I've tried; I could definitely taste the basil and fresh herbs which elevated the sweet and savory qualities of the soup. We also shared the avocado and mango rolls appetizer. It had a peanut sauce which was so yummy!
