Atmosphere is nice more on the professional side I felt, so definitely a place to take a client or have a lunch meeting . We were greeted at the front by a very smiley hostess, then were seated to the main dining room where we were handed the menu. I already had my eyes set on several items when checking the website, however it was on the Bar Menu, which is only available at yes, the bar. The bar menu is a specific menu filled with small plate items and only available at the bar from 5pm - close, this is not the Happy Hour Menu, although they do have that at a set time as well. The main dining room menu had great choices for main dishes, but we were more interested in trying several different dishes to share instead of eating one big dish each. So we politely asked if it was ok to move to the bar area and was replied with, \"It is your dining experience so feel free to sit wherever you would like\". We were pleased and very thankful of his response, cause in all honesty we felt very naggy at that point. We were moved over to the bar area, which wasn't bad, had a roomy table with view of the dining room. The only thing we found weird is that the bar area was not as loud as the dining area, where as typically it would be vice versa. \n\nStarted off with the drinks, found the drink choices to be more on the manly side; no cosmos, mojitos, or anything girly. One of my girlfirends even said that their drinks seem like it would put some hair on your chest. After eying the cocktail menu, decided on the Il Terranova: Botanical Vodka, Cynar, Cucumber, Agave Nectar, and Lime. Thought it would be refreshing and light, however it came out to taste somewhat like I was drinking whisky. Then we ordered, and ordered a lot and to be honest it was really hit or miss and to the extreme. Some dishes were either really good or really ehhhh. \n\nTo the food: \nAhi Tuna Tartare - Hit: This was one of the faves of the table, fresh with a little kick due to Jalapeno and Black Siracha\nPork Belly Fries - Miss: Not what we expected coming out. We ordered thinking it would be sliced pork belly, mocking the shape of fries or pork belly w/a side of fries. It was actually minced pork belly and kimchee sprinkled on top of thick cut fries. This was disappointing because the fries were the main attraction but the least wanted. What we did try of the pork belly was really good, however not enough of. \nCrispy Squash Blossoms - Hit: 2 squash blossoms with a couple fried green beans. Squash blossoms were light, yet very crispy which I liked. \nMushroom Arancini - Miss: We were told they were out of, so asked if we would like to opt for the crab cakes. Sure!!! The server brought it out.. Wow someone said, and a giggle came another. Is this what they feed the crabs that they are using to make the actual crab cakes?!?! They were tiny, good but way to tiny.. \nDuck Liver Mousse - Hit: This had to be my favorite. Very smooth texture, not overly mineral in taste, and paired with the pickled rhubarb and shallots, mmmmmmmmmm.. The best thing I had there. \nSmoked Halibut Brandade - Miss: Texture was nice and smooth, but flavor was bland. So it made me feel like I was smearing seasoned mashed potatoes on a crostini\nCheese Plate - Hit: But I mean how can you get cheese wrong\nSteak Frites: Kobe Bavette was tender and flavorful.

I like omelettes where the ingredients are cooked INTO the egg better. And I like a fluffier consistency of egg. The things that made up were the crab, which was fresh & delicious, and the toast which (though slightly over-buttered) had a perfect crunch to it.\n\n* Spicy Italian Sausage - 4 stars\n(fresh italian butter beans, braised escarole, fried egg, lipstick peppers and garlic crumbs. $13.50)\nLoved the sausage.
