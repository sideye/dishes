So, before I write my review, let me explain this so that hopefully my review will help you make an informed decision on wither you want to order from this place, and ultimately anyplace in SF.\n\nOne of the big reasons why I moved back here is that there are tons of restaurants of pretty much anything you could ever want, in pretty close proximity. That is great, but the problem is that it seems like 85% are all kind of blah, the same thing, and not standing out for flavor profiles. Example: I've had 15 different bin mah sandwich's at 15 different places and non of them come close to the one's in Miami from one place (Miss Saigon), same thing with Fried Rice (either Chinese or Japanese) competitive with Denver and Miami (Go To Sushi -Miami- has the best Japanese fried rice that I have had outside of of the Kyoto tower and Osaka). This city is supposed to be Asian food heaven, but so far it has been a constant let down. Kinda like this place.\n\nThe good: \n1. They deliver, and they do it till late night with a minimum of $$$ for your order, and pretty quick (ours came in 35min), yay!\n2. Proportions are pretty big, yay!, you'll be eating it for a couple of days.\n3. Best overall pictures (taken by a person who works there and knows what they are doing..no stupid Instagram camera photo there) so you know what your ordering and what it will look like. \n\nThe bad:\n1. Everything is just.....bland, some people are writing that stuff here is yummy, but honestly, I have no idea what they are thinking. Have they been just eating non-big-favor food, were their parents horrible cooks? And, is just eating food is a joyous occasion because everything else in their lives tasted like cold oatmeal, without the flavor packets? Do they want the attention, of blathering on and on just to hear themselves talk (see what I did there...that's irony) I have no idea, but here is what we ordered, and why I was let down (so far have not found ANY Chinese places that are any better for delivery for when I'm particularly lazy):\n\nThai Ice Tea -- not very sweet (5/10), bitter, not enough condensed milk.\n\nPot Stickers (6) -- the thickness of the dough was perfect (thick but not a bun), and the filling was pretty good, but they refuse to give you any sauce, Which sucks, because that ginger, soy sauce, garlic green onion stuff is perfect for this, and I'm too lazy to get of my ass and make it, that's why we invented delivery.\n\nFried Rice -- Had the best pictures for any fried rice that I've ever seen (the guy who took a pic of the entire menu for Yelp did a great job), and was really excited. But, it was the blandest fried rice he's had. It was not the super oily, dark type (it was a short grain kinda fluffy, but you could tell that they were not using the leftover rice from yesterday, which is the secret for great consistently fried rice. But, there was hardly any flavor to it. They used dark meat chicken, did not add green onions, and asked for it spicy (not spicy). Fluffy=good, not tasty=bad.\n\nFresh Lemonade -- fresh made, semi sweet, perfect amount of sugar vs. bitter. Around 8 oz.\n\nGeneral Tsao's Chicken (Lunch Menu) -- Bland, no flavor, tasted mild spicy level (when ordered spicy), over use of corn starch = disappointment.\n\nWon Ton Soup (Large) -- Wontons where pretty good, but soup base was off, don't know how to explain it, but just didn't really go there like wonton normally does. Got directions correct for no veggies, but disregarded leave green onions.\n\nShrimp Wonton -- It means meat wonton soup WITH shrimp, not shrimp wonton soup.\n\nTofu Sweet Corn Soup -- it's eggdrop soup with tofu, corn and egg, not a unique soup.\n\nFried Crab Meat Rangoon (6) -- Oil has not been filtered (so that you can reuse oil), had a very burnt taste, refuse to give you dipping sauce (red cornstarch based stuff).\n\nOrder for 3 people.", "rating": 2, "date": "2014-01-14"}], "yee wor wonton with fresh chicken soup": [], "seafood tofu egg flower soup": [], "meatless chicken with mixed vegetable soup": [], "meatless chicken hot and sour soup": [], "combination hot and sour soup": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered Wonton with Red Chili Oil, Combination Hot and Sour Soup, Salmon with Asparagus and String Bean, Salt and Pepper Calamari, General Tsao's Chicken and Sizzling Basil Beef.
