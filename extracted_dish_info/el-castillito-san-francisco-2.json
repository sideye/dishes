Lately I've been in search of very good Mexican food that resembles what they serve in those bomb diggity taco trucks.\n\nI walk in and notice the vintage-y like red chairs that are characteristic of diners, several round tables, and a juke box on the left.  I go straight to the back to place my order:  carne asada taco (which I thought was still a bit pricey at $2.29)... then I wanted to try something new, and the tall cook told me the different meats they had: pollo, carnitas, chorizo, and barbecue pork.  \"Barbecue pork?\" I wondered... so I said, yeah give me one of those too.\n\nI couldn't believe the amount of meat he scooped out and placed on the grill to reheat.  HELLA MEAT.  That's all that was in my mind.  HELLA MEAT.  The $2.29 pricetag per taco became unbelievably cheap for the amount of meat they give you.  I asked to eat in.  The tacos are 2 taco tortillas (I believe they were corn tortillas, which I love) plus the meats, then topped with onions (which I did not have), cilantro, and salsa (you have a choice of spicy and mild-aka-pico-de-gallo, but I asked for a little bit of both). \n\nI was extremely surprised that they have HORCHATA, so i ordered a small.  My meal came out to be $6.33.  Then the cashier asked, \"Do you want chips?\"  I said, \"Is it free?\".  He nodded.  \"SURE!\".  He scooped up corn tortilla chips and placed it on ANOTHER plastic tray lined with paper.  To the left of the cashier is a wonderful assortment of salsas, one resembling the kind they put in the taco.  There are 5 different types, and a bowl of sliced jalapenos.  It was a nice small salsa bar.\n\nI got settled to my table.... then I took a bite outta the MEATY carne asada taco.  I was speechless, but I had to say it after I finished masticating the first bite:  OH MY GOD, THIS IS SOOO GOOD.  BETTER THAN TACO TRUCKS.  \n\nI was thoroughly happy with the carne asada taco... I sipped on my Horchata and it was damn good too.  \n\nThere was this chick who ordered a special vegetarian burrito to go.  She was asked if she wanted chips as well, so I'm assuming the chips are free and you can take out your choice of salsa too.\n\nThen I proceeded to attack the 'barbecue pork' taco... which I found was actually the \"PASTOR\" (marinated pork).  DAMN it was hella good too.  \n\nI'm so happy about this experience that I give this place an all out 5 stars.

And last night, in warm tortilla sheets, the two consummated their union and issued a flavor that just held everything together.  What I tasted was passion.\n\n---------------\nprevious review (at 4 stars)\n\nTheir burritos are excellent.  Get one and you will understand.  I was skeptical of the grilled tortilla concept, but it works.  Got to get it with cheese though.  Too dry otherwise (I learned this the hard way).  I usually opt for carnitas + pinto beans.  \n\nTheir burritos are HUGE (much bigger than Casa Mexicana's for example).  I get the super burrito without sour cream and it's usually a struggle to finish.  \n\nDocking one star because their tacos are kind of lackluster, and because of the huge window.  Having the world walk by and gawk at me as I pig out makes me feel a little uncomfortable.

No kidding. That's how much their veggie tacos cost, including tax. I've been going to this place for over 5 years, and I don't think they've raised their prices. The only place I've ever had cheaper Mexican food was in Mexico.\n\nEverything's always very fresh and tastes great. They are very generous with their portion sizes, and ingredients. They'll substitute fresh avocado instead of guacamole, give you extra beans/salsa/etc., for no additional charge. Chips are also free.\n\nThere's often a long line, but it moves fast. It's loud and crowded around dinnertime, but definitely worth it -- in terms of price and quality, I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in SF. They're much better than the more expensive Mexican places around 16th & Mission.\n\nThe guys who work for have a great (if slightly twisted) sense of humor -- sometimes they'll ask if you want \"marijuana\" (ie, cilantro) on your burrito... and occasionally you'll hear a cat meowing when somebody's chopping up ingredients... they get a kick out of making fake cat noises, and then looking around, surprised.\n\nThey offer fresh-squeezed juice too, now: orange, carrot, celery & beet.

Lately I've been in search of very good Mexican food that resembles what they serve in those bomb diggity taco trucks.\n\nI walk in and notice the vintage-y like red chairs that are characteristic of diners, several round tables, and a juke box on the left.  I go straight to the back to place my order:  carne asada taco (which I thought was still a bit pricey at $2.29)... then I wanted to try something new, and the tall cook told me the different meats they had: pollo, carnitas, chorizo, and barbecue pork.  \"Barbecue pork?\" I wondered... so I said, yeah give me one of those too.\n\nI couldn't believe the amount of meat he scooped out and placed on the grill to reheat.  HELLA MEAT.  That's all that was in my mind.  HELLA MEAT.  The $2.29 pricetag per taco became unbelievably cheap for the amount of meat they give you.  I asked to eat in.  The tacos are 2 taco tortillas (I believe they were corn tortillas, which I love) plus the meats, then topped with onions (which I did not have), cilantro, and salsa (you have a choice of spicy and mild-aka-pico-de-gallo, but I asked for a little bit of both). \n\nI was extremely surprised that they have HORCHATA, so i ordered a small.  My meal came out to be $6.33.  Then the cashier asked, \"Do you want chips?\"  I said, \"Is it free?\".  He nodded.  \"SURE!\".  He scooped up corn tortilla chips and placed it on ANOTHER plastic tray lined with paper.  To the left of the cashier is a wonderful assortment of salsas, one resembling the kind they put in the taco.  There are 5 different types, and a bowl of sliced jalapenos.  It was a nice small salsa bar.\n\nI got settled to my table.... then I took a bite outta the MEATY carne asada taco.  I was speechless, but I had to say it after I finished masticating the first bite:  OH MY GOD, THIS IS SOOO GOOD.  BETTER THAN TACO TRUCKS.  \n\nI was thoroughly happy with the carne asada taco... I sipped on my Horchata and it was damn good too.  \n\nThere was this chick who ordered a special vegetarian burrito to go.  She was asked if she wanted chips as well, so I'm assuming the chips are free and you can take out your choice of salsa too.\n\nThen I proceeded to attack the 'barbecue pork' taco... which I found was actually the \"PASTOR\" (marinated pork).  DAMN it was hella good too.  \n\nI'm so happy about this experience that I give this place an all out 5 stars.

You actually talk to the people cooking your food over this fiberglass window. It's great! I ended up asking for a bean & cheese burrito and a cheese quesadilla. My boyfriend ordered something similar (oh, he got a veggie taco - mmm!). The cooks we ordered from were really funny and nice and understood our Spanish! Plus, they pretty much gave us whatever we wanted on our food (salsa, guacamole, sour cream - whatever you wanted to add).\n\nThe next thing was paying for the food.
