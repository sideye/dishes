But before I could get dessert my friend and I came here for dinner, which I think was even better!\n\nYou order at the counter and a server delivers your food, as Souvla is a casual Greek eatery with table service.  I ordered the Lamb Salad and shared Greek Fries with my friend.  Our food came out very quickly, and everything looked yummy.  \n\nWhat I was most pleased with was how much kale you get in the salad!  They definitely don't skimp out on the greens, so was happy to see they have quality greens in the salad mix, as there was romaine lettuce with kale.  The lamb was also very tender and cooked to medium rare, and loved how light yet flavorful the entire salad was.  I would happily order this again.  The Greek Fries were also good, as they were extra crispy and liked that they were handcut, with much garlic and lemon flavor.  The only minor issue was that it was a tad too oily, but nonetheless - it was still good.  And though we were full after our dinner we were determined to get the Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava, which was incredibly flavorful.  As soon as you take a bite you're immediately hit with how lemon-y the frozen yogurt is.  The Greek yogurt was very good, and highly recommend for anyone who likes Greek yogurt since it has that same distinct sour taste.  But have to say - the baklava with, was unnecessary.  It wasn't bad yet the texture was very grain-y and I probably would've liked it better had the topping been more mixed in versus scooped on to the side of the yogurt.  Next time - I most likely would get the yogurt by itself, as it's so flavorful on its own.  \n\nService was wonderful.  Our server who was also at the register checked in with us, as we were sitting at the bar next to the front.  He also saw me put my sweatshirt on when I was there, and said that he could shut one of the doors of the entrance if I was too cold, which was such a thoughtful gesture.  They also serve Greek wine here!  If I hadn't been drinking three days straight then I totally would've ordered some booze, but glad to know it's available for next time.

There's pork, chicken, lamb, and a vegetarian option for your meat. You can either get your meat in a salad or in a wrap.\n\nI chose the pork shoulder salad ($13). All my friends will tell you that I am not a salad eater at all (I know, I'm bad!), but almost everyone in the restaurant was eating the salad instead of the wrap. However, I really enjoyed my salad. The lettuce was nicely dressed without being overly soggy, and the sweetness from the tomatoes and acidity of the red onions tasted great together. The pork overall was pretty moist, though some pieces were much more lean compared to others, making the texture not always the same. I love meat, but I have to say that the ratio of meat to lettuce was off. I finished all my lettuce and toppings (including every bit of that delicious feta cheese), but I had a bunch of meat leftover. \n\nMy friend and I also ordered greek fries with a side of garlic spread and they were also good.

The sauce on the chicken salad is their special \"granch\" dressing, and the lamb has a harissa-spiked yogurt. There is plenty of meat and salad portions in both the chicken, pork, and lamb options. And if you're not a salad person, you can have it sandwich style. I would also suggest ordering their greek fries which is seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and mizithra cheese.

They definitely don't skimp out on the greens, so was happy to see they have quality greens in the salad mix, as there was romaine lettuce with kale.  The lamb was also very tender and cooked to medium rare, and loved how light yet flavorful the entire salad was.  I would happily order this again.

Only thing I can ding them for was forgetting my order of their Greek Fries (sad face!). But the food quality was so good, I'll just chalk it up to human error and ask for a Caviar refund, no sweat.\n\nIt was all so good, I ate it all before I thought of taking any photos. But it looked very edible and neatly packaged ;-) \n\nAvgolemono Soup (Traditional Greek egg-lemon soup with rice and chicken): SO GOOD. Delicious, homey, like something my grandma would make if she was Greek rather than Scottish. $6 for bowl (about 2 cups in container). \n\nPork Sandwich (American homestead pork shoulder with minted Greek yogurt, cherry tomato, pickled red onion, cucumber, and feta cheese wrapped in fresh and warm pita bread): A bit messy to eat as the thick pita couldn't contain all the inside goodness as I unwrapped the brown paper surrounding the sandwich, but OMG DELICIOUS. Very filling. $11\n\nExtra Yogurt Sauce: I tried all of them, Harissa, Minted, Granch and Garlic. All were good, Harissa has a surprisingly strong kick for being a little container of sauce... but the Garlic was THE BEST, I added onto the Pork Sandwich for extra delicious power. $1 each\n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt with Greek Olive Oil and Flaky Sea Salt: I was going to go with the Baklava Crumbles and Syrup version but I read another review that warned it was overpoweringly sweet. This olive oil and salt version was delicious, but weird, as I kept expecting it to taste a bit sweet because of my American programming that all yogurt is sweet. This is definitely not. It's a powerful combination of natural tastes and strong, fragrant oil with crunchy salt flakes. It is not at all delicate. Some may love it. I am on the fence ;-) $4\n\nGreek Rose wine (Skouras Zoe, Peloponnese 2014): Bottle (standard 750 ml) actually 2016 vintage for anyone who cares. Very light taste and pretty color. Went well with the food but mixing with the Garlic Yogurt Sauce was a bit of a weirdo mixer in my mouth. 12.5% alcohol. Label customized for Souvla by Diamond Importers, with Soulva's logo and a B&W photo of a happy man with salt & pepper hair and impressive 'stache .
