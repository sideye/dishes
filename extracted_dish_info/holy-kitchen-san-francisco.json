Most everything tastes amazing, and I list particularly spectacular dishes below. The restaurant is clean, with a light happy atmosphere (think yellow walls and soft Indian music). Some reviews criticize the ambiance because the restaurant is empty, but as far as we can tell the only reason it's occasionally empty are reviews like those! \n\nThe staff are wonderfully accommodating, efficient, and polite. Everyone we take there raves about the food. For us though, the restaurant's kid-friendly nature is the real winner. They love having kids in the restaurant, don't mind when they get the tablecloths dirty, make mild dishes truly mild, have a centrally located and easy to monitor bathroom, offer more than enough highchairs, and don't bat an eyelash when you have to run when the wheels suddenly come off (they grab the check and pack all the leftovers in a snap). Our kids dine here regularly and with no stress. \n\nAs for food, all the chicken dishes we've had were made with large chunks of carefully trimmed breast meat, never gristle. We're particularly fond of the Badami Chicken, a nutty, creamy curry, and the Peas Pilau, a rice dish with nuts and onions. The Chicken Tikka Masala is a bit tomoato-y for my taste, but my daughter and sister-in-law love it. My mom is a huge fan of the Chicken Vindaloo. The Eggplant Bharta is a family favorite.

One of my favorite dishes, I think you can measure how good an Indian restaurant is by how good their chicken curry is.  Indian curry is not like Thai or Japanese curry.  This was disappointing.  Very mediocre.  Pass.\n\nDisclaimer:\nYou shouldn't order chicken curry when you make a kick-ass version yourself...& so does your mom.\n\nThe garlic naan...\nIt had a good degree of garlic & it did satisfy the garlic craving.

A touch tart, but not bad (again, Amber India makes a great one).  They do a house \"lemon water,\" aka lemonade.  My man loved it.\n\nOverall, not bad.
