I wonder if management has changed or something last year?\n\nDuring our visit in October, the tostada salad was one of the most disgusting things I've ever tried. I ordered it vegetarian with no beans and no sour cream. It came out vegetarian but with beans and sour cream, plus it looked terrible. I sent it back and after a few minutes, what looked like a chef or manager or someone came out and asked me what was wrong with it and claiming it was what I ordered. I explained my order and after a bit of arguing, he went back to the kitchen. A new one came out after my boyfriend was almost done with his meal...\n\nThe most disgusting part was literally everything about the salad. The tostada was tiny, wet, soaked with oil and limp. The lettuce was cheap shredded taco lettuce. Half the vegetables were cooked, so the finely shredded lettuce got warm and limp fast. There was a single piece of broccoli and it tasted incredibly rancid. There was melted cheese on the bottom of everything, so it stuck to the plate. It was so bad and I already felt guilty for sending it back in the first place, so I ate not even a quarter of it.\n\nNext visit in November: I left the October visit behind me, because I was positive we would have a better visit to my previously favorite Mexican restaurant... The service was slower than ever. It was so bad, I watched a table in the back of the room get upset with the waiter then walk out (I guess they were waiting a long time, too). My mom ordered fajitas and the flour tortillas never came until the end, so they were dessert I guess? Everything bad that could have happened, really did. I don't think our waiter was to blame.
