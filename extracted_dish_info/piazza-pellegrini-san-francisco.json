We had not received any bread or drinks, unlike many of the other tables that had arrived after us. When our server, Rosario, did finally arrive, he took our orders and rushed off. The rest of the night we saw our server only when the food came out, and when he wanted the check. When he brought the food out, he offered some pepper for the top. When we said yes, he gave one careless twist, barely putting on any pepper, and walked off (not asking how much we wanted). When my girlfriend asked for some Parmesan for her main dish, he gave her a rude look, and, after a two minute wait, he came back to give a quick two swipes of grated cheese, putting on very little, before turning his back and walking away (again not asking if she would like more). Additionally, I was forced to ask one of the bus boys for a refill on my diet coke because our server, Rosario, was too busy flirting for a good 5 minutes with women at all his other tables. \n\nDisregarding the terrible and disrespectful service, the food each time has been excellent. The bruschetta is a fantastic appetizer, with four slices (two with tomatoes and two with mushroom and mozzarella). Additonaly, the entrees are well presented and delicious.

The wife and I went there for the first time the other day and overall it is a four star place, based on the strength of the main events: the appetizers, salads and the main courses.\n\nThey started off with a mixed bag: bad bread (tasteless) with excellent olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip. The wife loved the balsamic vinegar so much we bought a bottle. Speaking of bottles, we brought our own bottle of wine, which the waiter gladly opened and poured (we had him bring an extra glass so that he could have a taste too).\n\nWe started with the Timballo di Verdura appetizer, which consists of layers of grilled vegetables, tomatoes and mozzarella. It was great - we could have had two or three of these. She had the Insalta Mista while I had the spinach salad. She loved hers and I liked mine (I've had better, but this was good). For the main course she had the Farfallette al Salmone Affumicato (bowtie pasta with smoked salmon, peas, dill and vodka, in light cream tomato sauce) while I had the crab ravioli with pesto sauce.

My raviolis were stuffed with great tasting crab, and the blend of ingredients in her dinner worked perfectly.\n\nSo after starting off on a sour note with the bad bread (but excellent dip) and then having an excellent meal we finished with the desserts. Neither one (my Torta Caprese - light flourless chocolate cake served with raspberry sauce - and her Crostata di Mele - crisp short pastry crust topped with apples and apricot glaze served with vanilla gelato) matched the excellence of the meal.\n\nOne minor quibble on service is that our waiter never offered fresh ground pepper or fresh ground parmesan cheese (both of which we saw used at other tables after our need for them was gone).\n\nThe biggest negative point for me was the music. Whatever it was, it was unrecognizable and unpleasant. This is an Italian bistro. Play some nice Italian music or opera or something. Or some really nice dinner jazz.
