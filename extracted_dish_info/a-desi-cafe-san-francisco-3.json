I ordered at 11:09am and it arrived at 11:47am.\n\nPrices below are what I paid using DoorDash. From what I can find online, I'll list what looks like their in store menu prices below.\n\n*Vegetable Samosa ($4.50): Puff pastries filled w/potatoes, sweet peas, herbs and spices (2 pcs)\n~Normally $4, so you're being charged $0.50 more. The samosas were crispy on the outside and soft in the center. The potato and peas filling had a nice curry flavor. I love mint chutney and theirs was very creamy and minty, but it needed more seasoning. It was actually kind of bland.\n\n*Butter Chicken ($11.95): Boneless tandoori chicken in a sauce of butter, tomatoes, and spices\n~Looks like regular price is $10.50, so priced $1.45 higher. I love both butter chicken and tikka masala. While debating which one to get, I looked at pix on Yelp. The butter chicken looked more creamy and comforting, so I went with that. I asked for it spicy and it had a little heat, but I found the curry itself way too sweet. Did they add sugar? It was rather odd as I haven't had an Indian curry this sweet before. Also, it's good to note they put shredded chicken in this and not chucks of chicken like most curries spots I've ordered from.\n\n*Garlic Nan ($2.50): Naan with fresh garlic and cilantro\n~Regular price is $2.25, so $0.25 upcharge. This was delicious! Soft and chewy with great garlic flavor!\n\n*Onion Kulcha ($2.95): Naan stuffed with onions and fresh cilantro\n~Looks like regular price is $2.50, so $0.45 more via DoorDash. Naan is their strength as I also loved the onion kulcha. Stuffed with a good amount of onions, etc. Soft, chewy and great for dipping.\n\nDelicious naan and samosas! But their curry was way too sweet for me. I know when making curries spicy, it can bring out a bitterness in the spice. Sugar is sometimes used to counteract that. If that was the case here, they used too much sugar. I couldn't get over how sweet the butter chicken was. Not sure how the butter chicken normally tastes, but the spicy version needs less sugar and more spice.

The dark meat was good, but the white meat was too dry. I had to drench it in the cucumber dipping sauce for more flavor. \n\nThe samosas were pretty good, especially with the brown dipping sauce. \n\nThe saag paneer was okay...it was a lot more fresh spinach based (which some people may prefer) than creamier versions I've had. It is healthier to have less cream, but it also did not have a lot of flavor to it. \n\nThe garlic naan was mediocre as well. The garlic was mild and some pieces barely had any, only a yellow coating of butter.

This was delicious! Soft and chewy with great garlic flavor!\n\n*Onion Kulcha ($2.95): Naan stuffed with onions and fresh cilantro\n~Looks like regular price is $2.50, so $0.45 more via DoorDash. Naan is their strength as I also loved the onion kulcha. Stuffed with a good amount of onions, etc. Soft, chewy and great for dipping.\n\nDelicious naan and samosas! But their curry was way too sweet for me. I know when making curries spicy, it can bring out a bitterness in the spice. Sugar is sometimes used to counteract that.

Let's not waste time \n\nYou can get almost anything spiced up from mild to good luck( ok well I made that up but it can get sweaty)\n\n- masala chai tea - very fragrant. You can add sugar but I do without it. It's a steal for the price and they will refill your cup. I came here to eat today just because I craved milk tea or well masala chai tea \n\n-  chicken soup - it's a creamy bowl of chicken soup! I made it spicy but I think it's better without the kick. It's a huge bowl. I recommend sharing it\n\n- tandoori chicken - you can get a whole chicken! It's definitely different since you don't get only the leg. It comes sizzling with smoke as that chicken is laid down. For the price it's a steal! Plenty to go around . \n\n - chicken korma - this maybe my favorite curry. It's sweet, savory, smooth and so fragrant. Cashew, raisin, and saffron sauce\n\n- fish masala - a classic, savory and hearty like curry. The fish is cooked perfectly. It flakes off nicely and you can see the glistening juices. \n\n- tandoori fish - a whole fish sizzling and smoking on a platter. This is a special they may have randomly. That grilled flavor is all over. Crispy skin. Tender flesh. Just beware of bones ! \n\n- biryani - flavorful fragrant rice. I got chicken with mine and there was a lot of chicken big pieces hidden in the rice.\n\n- kabuli naan - my most favorite naan. It has sweet coconut flakes and fruity flavor of cherries inside. It's great on it own or maybe with some chai as a afternoon snack. I would have this anytime of the day ! I can't say if it pairs well with the curries because it's sweet and the flavors kind of counter each other evenly, but it'll help reduce the spiciness if it's overwhelming.  I always order another one to go after my meal plus the ones I didn't finish lol. Yes I love it!\n\nGulab jamun - just think donut holes but more dense soaked in a sweet buttery syrup. I drank the syrup too. Got to satisfy my sweet tooth. \n\nSaffron rice pudding - it felt more like a drink than a pudding. Flavors were good but very liquidity. I was expecting a thick pudding consistency or at least some what thick. I don't know but happy to have tried it. Killed my curiosity and satisfied my craving. Not sure if I'll get it again but I did enjoy everything except the rice . The rice didn't absorb much flavor.\n\nService has always been excellent and friendly here.

Let's not waste time \n\nYou can get almost anything spiced up from mild to good luck( ok well I made that up but it can get sweaty)\n\n- masala chai tea - very fragrant. You can add sugar but I do without it. It's a steal for the price and they will refill your cup. I came here to eat today just because I craved milk tea or well masala chai tea \n\n-  chicken soup - it's a creamy bowl of chicken soup! I made it spicy but I think it's better without the kick. It's a huge bowl. I recommend sharing it\n\n- tandoori chicken - you can get a whole chicken! It's definitely different since you don't get only the leg. It comes sizzling with smoke as that chicken is laid down. For the price it's a steal! Plenty to go around . \n\n - chicken korma - this maybe my favorite curry. It's sweet, savory, smooth and so fragrant. Cashew, raisin, and saffron sauce\n\n- fish masala - a classic, savory and hearty like curry. The fish is cooked perfectly. It flakes off nicely and you can see the glistening juices. \n\n- tandoori fish - a whole fish sizzling and smoking on a platter. This is a special they may have randomly. That grilled flavor is all over. Crispy skin. Tender flesh. Just beware of bones ! \n\n- biryani - flavorful fragrant rice. I got chicken with mine and there was a lot of chicken big pieces hidden in the rice.\n\n- kabuli naan - my most favorite naan. It has sweet coconut flakes and fruity flavor of cherries inside. It's great on it own or maybe with some chai as a afternoon snack. I would have this anytime of the day ! I can't say if it pairs well with the curries because it's sweet and the flavors kind of counter each other evenly, but it'll help reduce the spiciness if it's overwhelming.  I always order another one to go after my meal plus the ones I didn't finish lol. Yes I love it!\n\nGulab jamun - just think donut holes but more dense soaked in a sweet buttery syrup. I drank the syrup too. Got to satisfy my sweet tooth. \n\nSaffron rice pudding - it felt more like a drink than a pudding. Flavors were good but very liquidity. I was expecting a thick pudding consistency or at least some what thick. I don't know but happy to have tried it. Killed my curiosity and satisfied my craving. Not sure if I'll get it again but I did enjoy everything except the rice . The rice didn't absorb much flavor.\n\nService has always been excellent and friendly here. Was even suggested to eat the naan with curry and fry and egg with it for breakfast. Sounds like a great idea !\n\nYou can always ask for the house spicy sauce if you like to add a big kick to your food . It's great that way Incase others can't tolerate spicy levels above mild. \n\nPs don't get fooled by the small container the curry comes in.

That this place couldn't be as cool as I was hoping. \n\nThe curry dishes are thin and soupy which isn't an issue for me, but is for some folks. Their protein per meat dish is a little low, even at this price point. The aloo chat came and the potatoes weren't quite crisp enough to stand up to their own sauce, other than that this dish was good. I ordered saag paneer which was decent and probably the best dish we got. The malai kofta was interesting but I probably wouldn't get it again with the other options present.

It would have been perfect & the flavors were all there except one small detail, the lamb itself tasted like it died of old age a week ago. It just wasn't good quality at all. For $10 in SF I don't expect the best lamb ever. My best lamb dish ever was part of a $500 dinner, so I am very aware of how much I should curb my expectations. The meat in this dish wasn't the worst I've ever had but it was in the bottom 10 easily. The part that upsets me is I can taste the mint in the fat and it was delicious! So I know these guys know what's up, they are just using really inferior ingredients to maintain their margins. It left me shaking my head at how much I wanted to love it here. \n\nI would suggest sticking to chicken and vegetable staples if you come here. I'm left to assume that the more imperial dishes are their naan and butter. If this place were to use better lamb and add a soda machine instead of cans... I'd definitely come back. For now I remain deeply saddened by this trip. I took 6 take out boxes of Indian food and two naan home. That never happens.

It was rated 4.5 stars with 153 reviews, so I decided to give it a shot because I figured that it would be hella good based upon my fellow Yelpers' reviews.\n\nI was not at all disappointed.\n\nFrom the moment I got there, I was met with impeccable, 5* service.  Devender (I don't know if he was an employee or the owner) was so helpful when placing my order and not at all judgmental that I literally ordered 8 items just for myself.  ( What can I say?

Every single item was damn good.  A colleague of mine tried everything too and if it wasn't for her already having eaten and being stuffed, I probably wouldn't have so much left over food.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is that I had to put salt on everything, although I think that's a personal issue.  I own the fact that I'm a salt whore.  But it was probably better that way because my colleague doesn't like salty food.  As a matter of fact, I had never thought about how much salt must be added to Indian food elsewhere until eating the food from this place.\n\nSo...In summary, I totally recommend this restaurant.

I ordered at 11:09am and it arrived at 11:47am.\n\nPrices below are what I paid using DoorDash. From what I can find online, I'll list what looks like their in store menu prices below.\n\n*Vegetable Samosa ($4.50): Puff pastries filled w/potatoes, sweet peas, herbs and spices (2 pcs)\n~Normally $4, so you're being charged $0.50 more. The samosas were crispy on the outside and soft in the center. The potato and peas filling had a nice curry flavor. I love mint chutney and theirs was very creamy and minty, but it needed more seasoning. It was actually kind of bland.\n\n*Butter Chicken ($11.95): Boneless tandoori chicken in a sauce of butter, tomatoes, and spices\n~Looks like regular price is $10.50, so priced $1.45 higher. I love both butter chicken and tikka masala. While debating which one to get, I looked at pix on Yelp. The butter chicken looked more creamy and comforting, so I went with that. I asked for it spicy and it had a little heat, but I found the curry itself way too sweet. Did they add sugar? It was rather odd as I haven't had an Indian curry this sweet before. Also, it's good to note they put shredded chicken in this and not chucks of chicken like most curries spots I've ordered from.\n\n*Garlic Nan ($2.50): Naan with fresh garlic and cilantro\n~Regular price is $2.25, so $0.25 upcharge. This was delicious! Soft and chewy with great garlic flavor!\n\n*Onion Kulcha ($2.95): Naan stuffed with onions and fresh cilantro\n~Looks like regular price is $2.50, so $0.45 more via DoorDash. Naan is their strength as I also loved the onion kulcha. Stuffed with a good amount of onions, etc. Soft, chewy and great for dipping.\n\nDelicious naan and samosas! But their curry was way too sweet for me. I know when making curries spicy, it can bring out a bitterness in the spice. Sugar is sometimes used to counteract that. If that was the case here, they used too much sugar. I couldn't get over how sweet the butter chicken was.

It would have been perfect & the flavors were all there except one small detail, the lamb itself tasted like it died of old age a week ago. It just wasn't good quality at all. For $10 in SF I don't expect the best lamb ever. My best lamb dish ever was part of a $500 dinner, so I am very aware of how much I should curb my expectations. The meat in this dish wasn't the worst I've ever had but it was in the bottom 10 easily. The part that upsets me is I can taste the mint in the fat and it was delicious! So I know these guys know what's up, they are just using really inferior ingredients to maintain their margins.

The menu is simple enough so that you get a decent variety of the usual choices without spreading themselves too thin by offering everything in such a small kitchen. That would be a disaster, so I was pleasantly surprised by the look and the aroma of everyone's food as I waited for my own. I was very hopeful to have super tasty Indian food in the outer sunset. \n\nAlas poor yelpers, part of me knew it well... That this place couldn't be as cool as I was hoping. \n\nThe curry dishes are thin and soupy which isn't an issue for me, but is for some folks. Their protein per meat dish is a little low, even at this price point. The aloo chat came and the potatoes weren't quite crisp enough to stand up to their own sauce, other than that this dish was good. I ordered saag paneer which was decent and probably the best dish we got. The malai kofta was interesting but I probably wouldn't get it again with the other options present. The garlic naan were good but not great. \n\nFinally the lamb korma...  It would have been perfect & the flavors were all there except one small detail, the lamb itself tasted like it died of old age a week ago. It just wasn't good quality at all. For $10 in SF I don't expect the best lamb ever. My best lamb dish ever was part of a $500 dinner, so I am very aware of how much I should curb my expectations. The meat in this dish wasn't the worst I've ever had but it was in the bottom 10 easily. The part that upsets me is I can taste the mint in the fat and it was delicious! So I know these guys know what's up, they are just using really inferior ingredients to maintain their margins. It left me shaking my head at how much I wanted to love it here. \n\nI would suggest sticking to chicken and vegetable staples if you come here.

You can add sugar but I do without it. It's a steal for the price and they will refill your cup.

It comes sizzling with smoke as that chicken is laid down. For the price it's a steal! Plenty to go around . \n\n - chicken korma - this maybe my favorite curry. It's sweet, savory, smooth and so fragrant. Cashew, raisin, and saffron sauce\n\n- fish masala - a classic, savory and hearty like curry. The fish is cooked perfectly. It flakes off nicely and you can see the glistening juices. \n\n- tandoori fish - a whole fish sizzling and smoking on a platter. This is a special they may have randomly. That grilled flavor is all over. Crispy skin. Tender flesh. Just beware of bones ! \n\n- biryani - flavorful fragrant rice. I got chicken with mine and there was a lot of chicken big pieces hidden in the rice.\n\n- kabuli naan - my most favorite naan. It has sweet coconut flakes and fruity flavor of cherries inside.

I don't really know how else to describe it other than that it tastes home made, real, and authentic.  Like it's made in small batches and not mass produced.  There's no overpowering tomato or cream taste.  Curry has very good texture, flavor, and plenty of moist chicken.   The other dishes are just as great and they don't skimp on the protein.

It's great on it own or maybe with some chai as a afternoon snack. I would have this anytime of the day ! I can't say if it pairs well with the curries because it's sweet and the flavors kind of counter each other evenly, but it'll help reduce the spiciness if it's overwhelming.  I always order another one to go after my meal plus the ones I didn't finish lol. Yes I love it!\n\nGulab jamun - just think donut holes but more dense soaked in a sweet buttery syrup. I drank the syrup too. Got to satisfy my sweet tooth. \n\nSaffron rice pudding - it felt more like a drink than a pudding. Flavors were good but very liquidity. I was expecting a thick pudding consistency or at least some what thick. I don't know but happy to have tried it. Killed my curiosity and satisfied my craving. Not sure if I'll get it again but I did enjoy everything except the rice . The rice didn't absorb much flavor.\n\nService has always been excellent and friendly here. Was even suggested to eat the naan with curry and fry and egg with it for breakfast. Sounds like a great idea !\n\nYou can always ask for the house spicy sauce if you like to add a big kick to your food . It's great that way Incase others can't tolerate spicy levels above mild. \n\nPs don't get fooled by the small container the curry comes in. It's very filling \n\nJesst eat it!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-04-24"}], "large taj mahal": [], "flying horse": [{"excerpts": ["We split a very large Flying Horse beer, along with our all-vegetarian meal consisting of:\nVegetarian Samosas\nPotatoes Chaat\nPaneer Makhani \nMalai Kofta \nVegetarian Biryani\nYogurt raita (helpful for cooling the spice down)\n"], "author": "Camille L.", "review": "My husband LOVES Indian food so I chose this (neighborhood place for us) for our Saturday night dinner date.\n\nAmbience: Really pleasant Indian music, not quite classical nor Bollywood but a bit of a mix; the perfect volume in the background.
