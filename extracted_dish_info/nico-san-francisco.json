The SO and I have been meaning to come here since it's one of the most affordable five course Michelins in the city. We visited on a Thursday night. It was pretty easy to get a last minute reservation, though the restaurant was fairly empty so maybe a walk in would have been possible. \n\nOverall, I was really impressed by how clean the execution on most of the dishes at Nico were. The ingredients were extremely fresh, and the flavors were thoughtfully composed. It was clearly French inspired dishes with some more modern Asian flavors infused in. \n\nTo start off, we had oysters with a nori cream on the base, mixed in with kiwis. I was more intellectually intrigued by this dish -- I've never had kiwis paired with an oyster than enthralled though. While the oysters tasted good, the cream and the kiwi overpowered the oyster and it ended up just tasting like creamy kiwi. Though tasty, when I have oyster, I want to have some of that oyster flavor. \n\nThe next course was the vegetable course which was pretty enjoyable. It was romaine broccoli grilled with some crispy leaves, cured egg yolk, and a really spectacular sauce base. The sauce really stole the show and let the flavors of the romaine broccoli shine. \n\nThird course was a wonderful veal broth with cured amberjack sashimi with hickory and shitaki mushrooms. I thought the sashimi slices were really generous (huge!) and the fish was extremely fresh. The veal broth was a nice interlude before the main, though I personally found the flavors to be a little too strong for a soup that maybe should have let the fish shine a bit more.\n\nFourth course was the meat course -- a rabbit stuffed with... can't remember what, and a wonderful fresh salad with chervil, which I haven't had since Paris amongst other fresh leaves. I thought the rabbit's execution could have been a bit cleaner -- it was fairly tough, though the red wine sauce with rabbit trimmings paired nicely with the salad and was so reminiscent of traditional French style cooking. This was probably my least favorite dish, though I appreciated the chervil. \n\nThere was an interesting palate cleanser after this. I don't remember the fruit, maybe kiwi? and parsley in ice form, which was oddly refreshing and tasty. But there was also a sweetened gin base that was ab it too aggressive for me, but certainly did refresh the palate.\n\nThe final course was a simple dessert course of a nice pudding textured dish with crumble, almond flavors, and pomegranate. A fine dessert, though nothing outstanding. \n\nThey also started the meal with savory madeleines and ended with sweet ones. Very reminiscent of Manresa, but I enjoyed the gesture nonetheless. \n\nOverall, for $70, this is an outstanding meal. Great portion sizes, attentive and wonderful service, and a thoughtfully crafted menu with clean execution.

I don't like rules or contrivances directing my meal.  So, when the waiter explained that the chef's preference is to \"surprise you\", and they only show you the menu if you insist, I found this at best silly at worst irritating.  They offer a 5 course prix fixe with no options at a very reasonable $55or a 3 course prix fixe ($35) where the diner selects any 3 of the 5 courses on that menu.  They also require the whole table to select the same option (3 or 5).  While I understand the pacing can be a bit challenging if not everyone has the same number of courses, since they only offer a total of 5 selections (along with only 3 appetizers), it seems awfully regimented to me.

The beets were mostly chiogga's and shaved thinly in their raw state.  I liked the textural contrast.  The crab was fresh and in big enough pieces so you could get a mouthful of that briny sweetness.  I did find a little errant shell, though.  My husband, who \"hates beets\" liked the dish, and refused to believe it had beets in it.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed savoy cabbage, kale puree, pickled kohlrabi and farm fresh egg yolk.  3.5 star\n\nI loved the brassica immersion concept here.  With some little tweaks it could have been a stronger dish.  While lovely to look at, having all the cabbage leaves so large in a liquid base made it difficult to eat without looking like a Cretan.  The combination of the cold puree with the yolk could be a real challenge for the not-very-texturally-adventurous (read my husband).  It needed something with a little more viscosity, too liquidy\n\nBlock cod with chard, romanesco, and Buddha's hand.  3.5\n\nThis was the most visually stunning dish.  The color and textural elements and their composition were very appealing.  I thought it was a little under seasoned.  None of the elements of the dish really asserted itself.  A friend just recently gave me a Buddha's hand.  It smelled lovely and looked wicked.  I think it's kind of gimmicky, though, and couldn't really detect it.  When black cod is poached as it was here, I think it has a bit of sliminess to it.\n\nVeal tenderloin with nettle, sun choke and black trumpet mushrooms.  5 star\n\nWhat can I say?  The veal was done to a perfect rosy pink.  It must have free range, because it had a lovely meaty flavor, and though tender had just the right touch of chew.  The nettle, choke and mushroom  tasted like a forest, in a good way, sweet, umami and  a little tang from the nettles.\n\nMeyer lemon cream, kiwi sorbet, pickled fennel with crunchy meringue.  4 stars\n\nThe pickled fennel was delicious - licorice, tart, crunchy.  It elevated what otherwise would have been a pretty good  dessert.\n\nOverall, the food, service and  intangibles were very good, but  the value was excellent.

"], "author": "Timothy Y.", "review": "Came here on a Tuesday evening. We tried almost everything on the menu. Incredible attention to detail (food). Very meticulous. I get the feeling that the chef hand picks one strawberry or one asparagus out at a time for best texture/presentation. We can see the chef(s) in the back being super intense and precise with his movements as you would expect from a master of his craft. \n\nI'm not a veggie guy, but the small vegetable appetizer plates were the tastiest veggie dishes I've ever had. The bread was pretty amazing. Never seen such amazing texture and color on bread. The cheese platter has some powerful cheese. Make sure you take advantage of the syrup on the plate to smooth out the pungent flavor. Unfortunately the the oysters were nothing special despite being $2/ea.\n\nWe ordered all the main entrees. I would rank them like this: 1 Black cod 2 Veal 3 Lamb. The black cod is heavenly (super tender and perfectly seared). I'm not normally a veal person, but this veal was so delicately prepared that I couldn't help but love it. The lamb was superb as well, but not as good as the other two. \n\nMake sure you try the white sangria with kumquats.\n\nI may or may not have a shed a tear of gratitude when the chef came out to ask how was the food. \n\nOne annoyance: The round table in the middle was slightly warped causing utensils to slide off the side.", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-04-10"}], "pluot": []}
