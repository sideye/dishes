Walk down the street to Caffe Sport. It seems like Caffe Sport is just overshadowed by its more popular and better marketed/publicized kin up the street - though I can't see why. When Sotto Mare told us our wait would be 45+ minutes, Caffe Sport seated us in just minutes and cleared a lovely large table for just the two of us who were looking to get a nice hot bowl of cioppino in our bellies. Honestly this may be my go-to cioppino spot in North Beach from now on because I'd rather be sitting with room to breathe on comfortable wooden benches at a lovely colorful tiled table than to wait for a mini two-top or bar spot next door.\n\nThe INSALATA BURRATA was in all seriousness the most heavenly burrata I've ever had in my life - it had the perfect amount of high quality balsamic vinegar over aptly lemony tart arrugula paired with the creamiest silkiest burrata cheese. The flavors just melted together and I dream about it to this day. The HOUSE MARINATED OLIVES are flavored with garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and were also delicious as an appetizer. \n\nWe decided upon both of their versions of cioppino so we could try them both - the CIOPPINO ROSSO (house marinara sauce) and the CIOPPINO BIANCO (lemon garlic white sauce). The cioppino here isn't soupy - it's more saucy though still slurpable with a spoon, best devoured dipped with bread. The two styles nicely contrasted and are both worth trying. The seafood in both was fresh and generously portioned.\n\nOur server was very helpful and attentive, and he helped us through the menu and made helpful suggestions and kept our wine glasses full.", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-03-10"}], "zucchini all vapore": [], "insallata della casa": [], "insallata caprese": [], "eggplant involtini": [{"excerpts": ["We had a caprese salad and eggplant involtini for staters, both were delicious along with a few cold Italian Lagers.

The white wine/garlic sauce is straightforward and delicious as is the Pasta w/funghi and meat and Rustica All Antonio (seafood).\n\nAs for the sauce that a few novice palates have referred to as mayonnaise, it's an Italian bechamel (becciamel or something like that). Essentially, bechamel with garlic. And the joker that said the pesto was greasy--what do you think is one of the 3 main ingredients in any pesto? Olive oil--hmm wonder why it's greasy? \n\nAlso, the no credit cards is very common in \"Family Style\" Italian restaurants. It's a lot easier to launder money when there isn't a paper trail.

In San Francisco Italian Restaurants you can pretty much determine if the food will be good,  by the bread they serve. Well, the bread was sliced white bread. The entrees were served the salad forgotten. The gnocchi dumplings were heavy ( not light and airy) and drowned in pesto sauce which lacked  flavor. It appeared to have had dried shavings of basil. The beef and pork pasta was flavorless and had a total of one mushroom cut in half. No fresh parm served here. It's the the stuff that comes out of the green can. The waitress never checked on us ( there were only about six people dining at lunch time so she wasn't busy). We had to call her attention to the fact that our salads never arrived. She offered a free dessert on the house. We left our plates with more than half of the meal on them. Will never return. The name lives on, but clearly not the same level as once was. Perhaps,new  ownership and/or new chef or just ????", "rating": 1, "date": "2018-03-02"}, {"excerpts": ["The gnocchi con pesto is also very tasty.

Seatings are only at 3 specific times each night.\n\nORDERING:\nEach party must order at least ONE double order of a dish.  Otherwise, feel free to share single orders of everything else.  The serving sizes are HUGE!  A single order will feed 4.  Think of this like going out for Chinese - everyone orders something and then the whole party shares.  A couple going out for dinner is still going to have to order ONE double order of something, so going to dinner here is better for parties of 4+ .\n\nSERVICE:\nThey are Italian, arrogant and at times rude.  The waiters are rushed and over worked, so do not expect small talk and mindless chatter.  At the later seating don't be surprised if your waiter is a little drunk... he may have been drinking wine since 4 pm !  Do not be offended or get upset if they ignore you because reservation was made in a name that ends in: -berg, -stein, -witz, -uyen, or -ow.  If you made your reservation under an Italian surname (or ending in a vowel), then expect better than average service.  Your food will not all arrive at the same time, so eat as it arrives.  Besides, there's not enough room on the table. SAVE ROOM, because more food is coming!  Turista , cosa vi aspettate ?\n\nSUCKER...\nOftentimes the kitchen has too much of a good thing (they cooked too much of a dish and it just isn't selling well). So, expect your waiter to simply drop off a double order of something you did not order.  The kitchen is trying to clear it out, the waiters are moving excess inventory, and you're hungry.  But, if YOU TOUCH IT, IT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR BILL !  AND - You're still going to get all of the food that you ordered as well...  Turista stupido !  They know EXACTLY what they are doing!\n\nFOOD:\nWith all of it's idiosyncrasies, Caffe Sport is still one of the BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANTS on the PLANET.  Lots of garlic, fresh ingredients, olive oil and authentic recipes.  Tutto Fresco!  The parmigiana melanzane (eggplant parmesan) is to die for - it is a must do!  The gnocchi con pesto is also very tasty.  Tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert is a must!\n\nDECOR and AMBIENCE:\nThe cobweb covered prosciutto hanging from the ceiling and the candle wax covered wicker wrapped chianti bottles on the tables should make you feel like a wiseguy, eating dinner in grandma's basement.  The tables are wooden picnic tables or old round electrical reels.  They were racking up LEED Points before it was en vogue !\n\nCASH ONLY!  \nLike true Italians... declare $1 to the IRS for every $5 they pocket!\n\nPARKING:\nIt's North Beach... GOOD LUCK!\n\nThey'd get 5 stars if it wasn't for their \"DUMP AND RUN\" scam of dropping off unordered food.  I've been here 20+ times and it has happened to us on 17-18 visits !

So, if you're looking for a reason to live, or for something to make your life more enjoyable, stop in at Caffe Sport for a decadent, filling, and flavorful meal.\n\nMy dear late granddad used to rave about Caffe Sport. Being a wine aficionado, and an original Mad Man (ad exec for TV Guide mag in the 50s and 60s, nbd), he took my mom and dad out to one of the primo spots in North Beach when he came to visit SF from Napa. My parents had shacked up together in a small Clement St apartment, and my dad boldly thought to ask Grandpa for my mom's hand in marriage over dinner at Caffe Sport (to which Grandpa said no... at first!). Well 26 years later, I'm here, and with four other siblings to boot, I guess it worked itself out after all.\n\nCaffe Sport brought my love of Italian food to the forefront of my taste buds. My parents always made great Italian food when I was growing up, but since they now don't eat meat or dairy, the food during holidays has mostly turned to fruit, eggs, and lentils. I was brought back to Caffe Sport recently with my friend's stepdad who likes to order almost everythingon the menu and eat family style (my favorite!), plus multiple bottles of wine, and lots of desserts. How can I complain?\n\nThe Pesto Gnocchi will *gnocchi* your socks off with it's tenderness. One of my favorite dishes of all time is the Rustica al' Antonio. I swear, someone's sweet little Italian grandmother is sitting in the kitchen, singing \"That's Amore\" in Italian, with a pastry bag of their delicious four cheese sauce, funneling it into each and every piece of penne. \n\nOkay, that's probably not what's happening, but that's what it tastes like, and it's simply divine. The Steamed Mussels are baller, and I normally don't order mussels or clams because I've read Kitchen Confidential, and, uhh yea, I have my reasons. But the garlic broth with sourdough bread dipped in it, ahhhh, this is probably what life is all about.\n\nEnjoy, Yelpers.

Which was hilariously out-of-place because all the other parties were families, elderly, and non-sloppy-drunk, respectable people (I was with my mom). Like, this is not a pub. And also super weird, some guy on the restaurant staff - I think he worked in the kitchen bc he wasn't a waiter - seemed to be encouraging it or flirting with some wasted girl - I mean, come ON dude. NOT the time/place to try and spit some game! You're just making this drunk girl yell and she's ruining my favorite pasta.  LOL. But, our waiter was excellent, and effectively counterbalanced the weirdness happening. \n\nNormally this situation would call for a negative Yelp review, but I just can't.

And we live in LA!!!\n\nWe come up to SF often, and we ALWAYS have to eat here. There's even been a couple of times (like this last time...)  where we order a couple of pastas to go, wrap it in layers of plastic and ziploc bags, and carry it on our flight home for family members who couldn't make the trip. LOL I know, I know.\n\nFirst off, the sauce you get with bread when you sit down is sooooo goooooodddd I'd be happy just eating bread and that sauce.\n\nWe have standard favorite pasta dishes we get here - Pesto, Meat Sauce, Lobster pasta. ALL the sauces have so much flavor, I just can't. \n\nI freakin love the pesto. It sorta smacks you in the face when you eat it. I mean, it's the kind of sauce where you can taste the ingredients very clearly - basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, parmesan, and I guess probably some proprietary blend of cheese/spices/etc from a family recipe...I don't know - just get it. My favorite pesto of ALL TIME!\n\nThe meat sauce - this last time we got the beef/pork ragu with mushrooms - it comes layered on cheesy creaminess and the FLAVORS man, the flavors.\n\nThe lobster pasta is expensive (market price), but it's tradition for my family to get that, and it is worth it. It's rich and savory and so good.\n\nI've also had the spinach gnocchi - perfect pillows for any sauce to lay on. Of course we got it with the pesto.\n\nI mean the place is not cheap, but we think it's worth it bc it's so good.

"], "author": "emily h.", "review": "ok... so my friend Josh and I decided that we wanted to have a light salad and maybe a drink.  I met him after work and we walked up to North Beach.  We tried to go to Sardino's ??  You know, that totally traditional and awesome Italian restaurant in North Beach?  Anyhoo, it was packed full of yuppies and we couldn't even try to belly up to the bar, so we walked back down the street.  Disappointed cuz it smelled REALLY good in there.  Like old Italian wine breath, and I really do mean that in a good way.  We were in a lacksidasical mood and neither of us really cared to take the lead and make the next decision. \n\nWe kinda paused in our walk because we couldn't decide.  Josh noticed a big fat lady on a tiny little patio outside the door and because she was so fat and the patio was so small, we looked inside the door.  Inside was a veritable cornucopia of colors, textures, noises, and men in white t-shirts bustling about.  I mean we are talking gingerbread palace.  Not a square inch of that place was anything close to bare wall.  It was all really weird and unidentifiable stylistically to me.  I should know because I work on a design show for HGTV, but I didn't.  There was also a table of screaming ladies.  We kinda poked our way in, not sure that this was the place we wanted to be.. and then a small grey haired Italian man ushered us into a table with 4 really humongous spoons on it.  We thought the table wasn't set... and felt a little flustered at being placed... but still went along.  Menu's arrived, along with some cutlery, but the spoons were never removed... making us feel like our table was maybe forgotten.. .like us.  We went back and forth over whether we should leave.  I didn't see any salad on the menu and the prices were a little higher than I wanted.  Josh said not to worry cuz he was paying cuz it was my birthday.  Then I saw at the very bottom of the simple menu of only fish and pasta options, a Salat Verte.  I imagined a sad little salad with a few beet stings and a carrot string, you know the type you get at tourist restaurants claiming to be the best, and tried to make Josh decide to leave again... but we stayed, he was annoyed that I wouldn't just make a decision.  I decided that the style of the restaurant was \"Old Italian Hansel and Grettle crazy gingerbread house import all weird things from Italy extravaganza with screaming girls and old italian waiters.\"  The girls were actually quite funny.  We ordered: the salat verte, a double order cuz we were imagining the sad salad and the dover sole sauteed with lemon, garlic and butter.  I ordered a sprite, which came immediately, and Josh ordered an Italian import beer which took three requests to appear.  The four spoons remained on the table the whole time.\n\nThe salad came.  It was a HUGE plate, easily enough for four people, delivered with an \"I told you so\" from our Italian waiter.  To his credit, he did say that a single salad would be enough.  He also plunked one of the big spoons into the salad.  So we weren't forgotten.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  Large pieces of romain with green olives and just a smattering of red onion sliced thin.... but the dressing OH THE DRESSING... It was like a pesto ceasar and I swear to you I have never had anything this delicious in my whole life.  Garlicy, strong, creamy pesto.  I noticed a handwritten sign on one of the many carved posts in the room that said something like: Alfredo da chef make a da best pesto but only he can make it\".... and he was right, who ever he was.   \n\nOur waiter came back and actually actually asked us \" you like-a-da-sauce?\"  We could only nod, our mouths full of crispy lettuce and tangy olives... da sauce dripping off of our chins.\n\nThen he delivered our Sole. Another spoon got plunked onto the dish. OH mY GOD AGAIN!  crisp little pieces of tiny asparagas covered the fish, fresh, a whole boneless side of the dover sole and yes, lots of butter and garlic and lemon.   We ate like old italians I'm sure.\n\nAs we came to near bursting point, I realized that we had never inquired as to the name of this restaurant... We asked the \"like-a-da-sauce\" waiter and he pointed to his T-shirt.  CAFFE SPORT? we both said out loud.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, how misleading can a name be?  No sport paraphanelia, and except for the screaming girls, no tourists for that matter, and did I mention the pesto salad dressing?  The restaurant should have been called Caffe King of Pesto...   So the waiter came to check on us one last time and Josh offered him his credit card.  Like-a-da-sauce grabbed a menu and politely showed Josh that they don't take cards... nice and old school, just the way it should be. There was an ATM nearby and at the end of our meal, the waiter finally removed the unused spoons, making us feel quite special indeed.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-05-02"}, {"excerpts": ["and we had the pasta con carne e funghi, pasta con vongole and an alfredo pasta.
