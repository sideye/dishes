Begin with the burger patty itself: a custom-ground, all-brisket chuck, not smashed, but cooked with a high-enough temperature upon cast-iron to render the interior a perfect pink, and to leave a generous crust of maillard-reaction action to sweeten the deal. Add toppings: The Hot Wes ($11, a perennial favorite back at Mojo) combines viscous, salty, rich queso, crispy onion string, and jalapeno peppers for a salty, meaty, spicy nod to Wes' roots in Texas. That the brioche-style bun was perfectly toasted was simply gilding on the lilly.\n\nThe sides (namely tater-tots) remain top-notch as well. Even though the tots are of the from-the-bag variety (or at least they were the last time I checked), a golden-brown, crispy exterior and piping hot interior are notable for their fantastic execution. Go animal style ($8), with queso (a man can never have too much queso), bulgogi bacon (!), and deeply-meaty grilled onions, and your satisfaction is almost guaranteed (unless you're a human monster). Also on the menu: potent mac-and-cheese, country style beans, and potato salad.\n\nIn other offerings, double-fried chicken is available, either in sandwich form, or on its own. An informal poll indicates that its absolutely perfect (like everything else Wes cooks). Five taps of mid-range beer (including Fort Point and Deschutes) offer a great way to compliment your meal, and wine and punch are both available for the connoisseur. \n\nLikewise, the ambiance and service were exceptional. Even though staff-members were still getting trained, my beer glass never went empty, everyone was friendly, and my burger came out quickly. A renovated jukebox plays a well-curated selection of funk, soul, and blues, while signs for lone-star beer, and a stuffed armadillo lend a pleasant tex-mex ambiance to the red, gold, and stone walls. \n\nFive Stars: Exceptionally-well executed, fundamentally sound, cheap burgers with outstanding sides and good selection of beer.

They have a table sauce when you die in that was pretty good. Not really sure what it was and the lady working there said it's had to describe, but it was like sweet, tangy, a little spicy. Made the tots edible as they were still over-fried and didn't taste like potatoes. \n\nWas feeling fat so on the way out I ordered a milkshake. I was between the buttermilk and peanut butter. The waitress recommended the peanut butter so i obliged. They also had a new flavor, horchata, which in retrospect I should have ordered since I never had one before. The peanut butter shake was just meh. The consistency wasn't that great and there was some kind of sour taste in it.

Wouldn't order this shake again, but might have to stop by and try the horchata.\n\nBasically the best thing I had at this burger joint, was the friend chicken sandwich. Smh.

I liked this burger better than Popson's.\n\nNASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN ($10) - Deep fried chicken sandwich, but spicy. Served with garlic mayo, lettuce, and pickles. Probably one of the better chicken sandwiches you'll find in San Francisco, and reasonably priced. The spicy was pretty spicy, but not to the point where my mouth was on fire and it was inedible.\n\nAll the burgers come with tater tots, which I love. They were crispy and on the lighter side (and didn't feel like they had been overly fried in oil). I wanted to get the cheesy tots, the cashier told me she would sell me a side of queso instead of getting tots with each sandwich and then a separate order of cheesy tots. Score.\n\nAll in all, 4.5 stars for a wonderful burger joint in San Francisco. If you're in the Mission and want an indulgent meal, this is a great spot. Probably best for 2-6 people, as the place is not super big.

It was a really hot day too, so it was nice to be able to relax and grub before heading back out to the city. \n\nLets get right into the fooood/drinks! I ordered a Cherry Lime Ricky with booze. Not enough booze BUT the drink itself was really tasty! It was bubbly and sweet, just how I like it. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken plate with two sides (collared greens and mac n chz). The chicken was SO good. It has a nice little spicy kick to it (I say little bc I eat super spicy stuff, but I am sure its very spicy for the average person LOL). It's crispyyyyy and hot and all around yummy. The collared greens weren't my favorite but at least I got some veggies in for the day. The mac n chz was bomb! The grainey taste just made it even better. I also tried the deluxe tots. They were ooooook. Crispy tots but not enough sauce to it. The grilled onions and the spicy mayo sauce tasted good, but if they added a little bit more topping on it, it would been perfect!\n\nI would love to come back again to try out more dishes!

My friend recommended the Nashville Hot Chicken, so I got that with a side of mac n' cheese and potato salad.\n\nMaybe it was just the time of day, but I got fried chicken with the worst breading to chicken ratio I've ever witnessed. I appreciated that everything was boneless, but it felt like they sliced a piece of chicken breast (the kind you might buy at grocery stores) vertically into thirds or fourths and gave you 3 pieces of that with tons of breading fried multiple times over. I honestly felt like I barely had chicken in the majority of my bites, and the cross-section just looked abysmal because of how thin the actual chicken was. The Nashville spice mix is no doubt a \"big kick in the pants,\" as they say in their description, but I felt like they overdid it with mine. The flavor was already pretty baked into the breading, but it seemed soaked on top of that, as every time I cut a piece of chicken, a considerable amount of hot oil would ooze out also. Eventually, the spice was just pretty numbing without a particularly compelling flavor behind it. I actually think it would have tasted fantastic if they took all the excess oil, etc. off, and I ate it with table(?) sauce they provide (the red one).\n\nNeither of my sides were particularly memorable either. The mac n' cheese fell prey to the classic problem where the top layer is all nicely crusted and delicious, but everything underneath felt neglected, with the cheese being a little gross-tasting and the side overall just devolving more and more into indiscriminate mush until I finally stopped eating it. The potato salad was okay--I thought it was decent when drowned with their table sauce, but it wasn't really able to hold its own without it.\n\nService was super friendly, and I really like that they let you self-serve everything from utensils to water. Prices are also fairly reasonable. Looking at reviews, I think it's possible that I got the wrong thing or experienced an unlucky time of day in their kitchen cycle. The chicken I got would definitely have been a lot better for a sandwich, and their menu has a lot of interesting options such as the Fried Chicken Burrito and Hot Wes that I would definitely consider coming back to try. At the same time, Taqueria Canc\u00fan, which I think has the best burrito in the area is literally next door, and I think I'd be hard-pressed to believe that going to WesBurger again would ever be more worth it than eating again at Canc\u00fan.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-08-22"}, {"excerpts": ["The guy and I shared their Okie Burger & a plate of their Nashville hot chicken (which is seriously spicy).

Formerly a popup at Mojo Bicycle Cafe on Divis, this new and permanent location is primetime hipster, nestled as it is on Mission between 18th & 19th - a few doors down from Mission Street Oyster Bar and Taqueria Cancun. It's a meaty antidote to the plant-based neighbors across the way, vegans Gracias Madre & Citizen Fox, and pescy-vegan Urban Fish (all names courtesy of Hipster Name Generator). So segregated have our culinary subdivisions become they even occupy their own sides of the street.\n\nI was determined to check out WesBurger during the \"soft launch\" as, even from a quick glance at the menu posted on the door, I sensed it would attract the inevitable lines once word gets out. Shhh! Don't tell anyone, at least not until you've tried it. Inside the decor is modern and funky but with touches that recall the diners of yesteryear, not least of which the jukebox. The menu is pretty classic with a few novel twists.\n\nThe Weekly Special Burger was not yet available, and given my dislike for onions, I opted for The All-American (sans said allium) which comes with \"special sauce\". I figured this the ideal reference burger, served up classic-style with lettuce and tomato. It didn't disappoint. The 6oz patty was well cooked with a definite chargrilled flavor. The sauce was luscious and the bun light, yet reassuringly well proportioned.\n\nAll in all, a well-executed exemplar of the genre. Taste and texture-wise I'd have to rank it above something like Super Duper (and it was considerably less greasy). Meanwhile it's definitely more classic than somewhere like Roam with all its exotic meats and toppings. I'm giving a rating of 4 stars for now because 5 stars would mean ranking among my top 10 burgers of all time - this was close but no Cuban on this occasion. That said, I can absolutely see WesBurger becoming a regular favorite; not only for the convenient location but also because the food is damn good.\n\nI can easily imagine working my way through this menu over the next few months, from the various burger options to the Shrimp N' Grits, to the Nashville Hot Chicken. The drink options were also solid, with some decent beers on tap and an interesting looking green punch which contains Vermouth and, I believe, cactus juice among other things.

The insane thing about this place is not just the burgers, but every other menu item is a 10/10. Maybe Queso dip with brisket bits added isn't your jam, but its the best damn Queso Dip with Briskit Bits you will find anywhere. Same goes for all the burgers. They have several options. Ive had all of them and they are all amazing. \n\nExecution - Whoever owns this restaurant should be very proud of their staff, all the way from the GM down to the line cooks and other employees. Everyone is so friendly and on point when they need to be. Always clean and tidy. Napkins always filled, everything always in the right spot, you could not ask for better service. \n\nConsistency - This is a big standout for them. Ive been a bunch of times and my good friend many many more. Something that annoys me is that you fall in love with a place, and an item, and you come back and its Great! But then you come back a few more times and its different, its not the thing you fell in love with. That has not happened to me here its something that really takes this place to the next level mentally when Im thinking about going. There are no mental snags saying 'oh its good but will it be amazing this time or will it be mediocre'. So far its always been the same and incredible !!\n\nMenu - Burgers are amazing. The ones Ive had - 'All-American', 'Hot Wes' 'PB&J' are Americana with a twist and they are best in class no doubt top top top level stuff in San Francisco and beyond. The chicken sando honestly is my favorite chicken sando in SF even though they are a \"burger place\". The fried chicken burrito is a top 3 contender for best burrito. WesBurger is the real deal, a true triple threat ! Im not vegetarian but the smoked portobello sandwich is out of this world so tasty !! Additionally, they provide two house salsas in sauce bottles both are excellent. Overall its some American classics with a Mexican twist. Perfect for the Mission District.\n\nConclusion - Its hard to stop saying good things about this place, but overall its the combination of the amazing food, execution of the establishment, and consistency that keep me coming back.

My friend recommended the Nashville Hot Chicken, so I got that with a side of mac n' cheese and potato salad.\n\nMaybe it was just the time of day, but I got fried chicken with the worst breading to chicken ratio I've ever witnessed. I appreciated that everything was boneless, but it felt like they sliced a piece of chicken breast (the kind you might buy at grocery stores) vertically into thirds or fourths and gave you 3 pieces of that with tons of breading fried multiple times over. I honestly felt like I barely had chicken in the majority of my bites, and the cross-section just looked abysmal because of how thin the actual chicken was. The Nashville spice mix is no doubt a \"big kick in the pants,\" as they say in their description, but I felt like they overdid it with mine. The flavor was already pretty baked into the breading, but it seemed soaked on top of that, as every time I cut a piece of chicken, a considerable amount of hot oil would ooze out also. Eventually, the spice was just pretty numbing without a particularly compelling flavor behind it. I actually think it would have tasted fantastic if they took all the excess oil, etc. off, and I ate it with table(?) sauce they provide (the red one).\n\nNeither of my sides were particularly memorable either. The mac n' cheese fell prey to the classic problem where the top layer is all nicely crusted and delicious, but everything underneath felt neglected, with the cheese being a little gross-tasting and the side overall just devolving more and more into indiscriminate mush until I finally stopped eating it. The potato salad was okay--I thought it was decent when drowned with their table sauce, but it wasn't really able to hold its own without it.\n\nService was super friendly, and I really like that they let you self-serve everything from utensils to water. Prices are also fairly reasonable. Looking at reviews, I think it's possible that I got the wrong thing or experienced an unlucky time of day in their kitchen cycle.

Wes' (as I will refer to it during the rest of this review) was suggested to me by a co-worker. Since it wasn't too far from my apartment I decided to walk down and try it out that weekend.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment twice.\n\nFOOD: Funny enough I still haven't had one of Wes' burgers. The real reason I adventured over to this restaurant was to try the fabled Fried Chicken Burrito. Yes, you read that write. A dream that can be made a reality. The burrito comes fully stocked with fried chicken, corn salad, pinto beans, avocado, cheese, and salsa and by golly is it good. I've ordered it both times I've gone. Now The Mission is known for it's Mexican food and burritos so this might come under some scrutiny. But honestly you can't compare the two. This is a completely different style of burrito. Approach it with an open mind and you'll be delighted. I've also had the deluxe tots. I'm from the east coast and out there deluxe tots means you are getting chili and cheese on tots but Wes' were different. Honestly I can't even tell you what all was on the tots but I can tell you it was tasty. I can't remember the last time I ordered deluxe tots and was surprised by what was topping them. The tots themselves are almost a meal so I suggest splitting them with someone if you also want an entree. You will definitely leave with a full stomach. One day soon I'll venture back to try a burger.\n\nDRINK: Wes' has a nice selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. I normally just get water with my food but I was impressed with their beer selection.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This place has a cool atmosphere. It honestly kind of reminds of a 50's style restaurant type of atmosphere. Music isn't too loud. The tables are close to either diners but nobody bothers anyone else. There are also booths if you want a little more privacy.\n\nSTAFF: The staff doesn't wait on your tables besides dropping off the food you order at the register. So besides registering there isn't much interaction. But the staff working the register has always been super friendly and when I first dined at Wes' someone came out of the back to ask how I was enjoying my meal. I also appreciate that.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI love trying new things. I'll go out of my way to eat something that I don't normally get in my week to week meals. Wes' takes the cake in that arena so far in my venturing around SF. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-11"}], "beefcake samwick": [{"excerpts": ["Beefcake Samwick $12 (?)\non website but not printed menu idk\n\nthough my breasts were in the midst of a burrito"], "author": "Dan B.", "review": "it's not called cheat day\nit's called finding myself again\n\nrlytho i've been dieting lately, which is why i only ate 2 entrees vs what you might expect enough to feed a small village\n\nok a medium village\n\n50s dinerish westernish vibe fun without being over the top\nmotown era on loop - literally it ended then they played it all again from the start #notcomplaining\n\n(^_^) The Hot Wes Anderson $11 (http://bit.ly/2dD2fIF)\nthe lunch burgeratic w hood missiou\n\n(^_^) Fried Chicken Burrito $11 (http://bit.ly/2drabMu)\nother restos plz pay attention\nthis is how to do nondry breasts\n\n(-_^) Browne Silverware $0 (http://bit.ly/2dHKnIV)\nbrave enough to not use oneida\n\n(?_?)

Instead, it provides a nice creamy, nuttiness to the burger that just makes you think \"yum!\". I also liked how the onion straws were crisp and contrasted with the peanut butter. The jam also had a nice sweet undertone. However, I'm not sure if it was supposed to impart any spiciness from the jalapenos though because it didn't. That being said, it was a delicious burger through and through!

After today I'm never going back. I have never in my entire life experienced what I did just there. RIDICULOUS! I now question any previous 1 star reviews I gave before because this one takes it to a new level and I have to reset my scale. \n\nIt started when my fiancee and I walked in to get a burger to-go. I got a Hot Wes and she got a chicken sandwich and we got tots and mac and cheese to share. They said they would call our name when it was ready. Ordered a beer to drink while we waited and sat down right next to the counter. That was around 7:19 according to the receipt. \n\nAround 8pm we realized we had been waiting a really long time. It was hard to tell who was getting their order but then we realized the people in front of us who had ordered for there had got their burger, ate it, and left. I asked how much longer on my order and they asked around. I figured they lost it or something. That's when they checked the bags on the counter it was sitting right there for at least 20+ minutes! \n\nThey give me the bag and apologize. I check the order and everything is lukewarm! Who wants a fancy cold burger? I mentioned it to the guy at the counter and they offer to redo it. I say that's fine. We asked how long it would take and they say \"we are slammed so it will take 20+ minutes\". That's when my fiancee asks if there is a manager. The guy says \"I'm the highest person here right now\" (first lie). He then offers to put the ticket first in the kitchen. We agree. My fiancee is annoyed and decides to go back to the house while I wait. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later another guy comes out and hands me a bag. Says something to the effect that I should call in my order closer to when I come in next time. I told him that was a to-go order I made right there and was waiting here. I didn't call anything in. \n\nI walk out and quickly realize the bag is even colder than the one I had before. In fact IT WAS THE SAME EXACT BAG! Nothing was re-done. They gave me my same order! \n\nI walk back in thinking it was mistake because it was the other guy that handed me the bag and that they were still remaking my order. I tell the guy at the counter and he says \"No it's all new! We just used the same bag!\" I then point out the tots are the same tots from before where I open the box to check the temp before. THE GUY AT THE REGISTER WHO WAS JUST TOUCHING MONEY AND HAD NOT WASHED HIS HANDS YET REACHES IN AND TOUCHES THE TOTS AND SAYS \"these are fresh tots!\". So gross! Major health code issues!\n\nI'm in shock! I can't believe it! I walk out and check the items in the bag again. Everything is cold. The cheese has hardened on everything. At this point the order is around an hour old. I storm back in and tell the guy straight to his face that he lied to me. It's the same order. He offers a refund which I accept. \n\nI then ask for a manager's phone number or an owner's contact info since he said there was no managers there. Suddenly.... A WILD MANAGER APPEARS! It was the guy that handed the cold bag back! He said he checked the order in the back and everything felt warm. He changed the cheese on the tots and changed the mac and cheese but everything else was fine so he re-bagged it! He lied about that because both of things he had admired to doing were still both cold. I said that is ridiculous and the guy just shrugged at me. Additionally - did he touch all our food to make this judgement? Seems like another violation. If its not a violation its absolutely unappetizing.\n\nThey lied to me 3 times. Touched my food without gloves or clean hands! Wasted an hour of time! Left me hungry. Never am I ever coming back. Going to miss that mac and cheese and that chicken sando. Just terrible.\n\nWesBurger.. If you are reading this, you guys made a mistake and admitted to it and instead of fixing it you made 3 more mistakes.

Besides reporting on the latest Kartrashian news like what they ate for breakfast and what soap they use to wash their ass (gotta be camera ready for all those naked selfies!), sometimes there are some worthwhile reads like this guy who hired a professional photographer to help him \"get the most likes\" on social media: http://bzfd.it/1MW2pSK. As a ridiculous as it sounds, having a professional food photographer piqued my interest. Not that I can afford one (nor would I ever hire one IF I had the money) but the thought of having drool worthy food porn...every single time via a professional is relieving for a Type A person like myself. Plus, I wouldn't have to look like that \"crazy Asian person taking food pics on a stool\" for that purrrrfect aerial shot. \n\nWesBurger has been in listed in multiple \"Best Burger Lists\" in San Francisco for the past year but his weekly pop-up at Mojo Bicycle Caf\u00e9 in NoPa was very difficult for me to get to on Wednesday nights. So, when I read that he was opening his brick and mortar up in Mission which is much closer to me, I was ecstatic! I stalked his social media posts on a daily basis for an opening date and got a chance to attend one of his soft openings earlier this week. \n\nI read that Mojo was often packed for Wes' weekly burger pop-up and he had lots of regulars. \n\nThirty minutes before soft opening night #3, there was already a line outside and he knew many customers by name so he definitely has a loyal following.\n\nFor the soft opening menu there were three burgers available ($11 each): Hot Wes (w/ onion rings, queso, and pickled jalapeno), Okie Burger (cooked on bed of onions w/ mustard, pickles, and American cheese), and I believe the Old American Burger (w/ lettuce, tomato, special sauce, and American cheese). Housemade veggie patty is available in any burger style. Also, on the menu is Fried Chicken (southern style or Nashville hot) and Tater Tots. Beer and wine only. I believe it's only cash only during the soft opening stage (ATM inside)? There's no waiter service; order at the counter, grab a number, and your food will be delivered to you. \n\nSince I had Tater Tot (my dog) in tow, we ordered to go (not recommended but we ate our food immediately in the car). I ran into fellow yelper, Michael M. while in line and took his lead on what to order since he was a regular at Wes' burger pop-up. He was nice enough to bring his order to me to take a food pic. Food porn of \"to-go\" orders never look as sexy as it's laid on a plate right? \n\nAt first glance, the Hot Wes may not look impressive, size-wise: http://bit.ly/22S1E9U but when I got to the car and unwrapped the foil....HELLO, GORGEOUS: http://bit.ly/1qllQzE. The thick, juicy brisket patty had a well-seasoned crust and was perfectly cradled by the toasted buttery brioche bun. I usually like me burgers plain with cheese because I don't want anything to distract from the delicious beefy flavor but the Hot Wes is Wes' signature burger for a reason. The melty queso, crunchy fried onion rings, and pickled jalapeno provide a harmonious melding of textures and layers of flavor. DO add bacon (+$2) on your burger for that extra layer of rich, porky flavor. My only gripe was the patty was cooked too well for my liking (medium well). Had it been medium rare, this would be my top burger pick in SF next to Rove Kitchen's. I'm confident they'll work out this kink before their grand opening. \n\nOf course, you gotta pair that delicious burger with some Tater Tots...deluxe at that ($8): http://bit.ly/1ME9qMY. Think animal style but an elevated version with bulgogi bacon that adds a savory caramelized crunch.  \n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken Platter ($13) for my friend who was waiting in the car with Tater Tot: http://bit.ly/1RNu6hF. The boneless chicken thigh has an uber crunchy batter (double fried) and was very moist and flavorful (brine?). You get three pieces so if you're hangry, you may want to order a bucket! You also get your choice of two sides (mac n' cheese, potato salad, collard greens, or baked beans). He wanted a double order of potato salad which was tangy and had a nice kick. The potatoes were a little undercooked though. \n\nThe staff were all very nice and my order to-go took about 12 minutes which was timely for a soft opening. \n\nLoved the retro ambiance with orange eames molded plastic chairs, green swivel counter chairs, and the vintage jukebox.  \n\nParking...well, it's in the heart of the mission.

It's safe to say, I was excited about finally trying the food in a traditional sit down environment.\n\nI finally headed down to the shop on a Monday sometime after the lunch rush. I had every intention of ordering a burger but after looking over their menu, I had to order their special, a portobello reuben. I figured if I liked the sandwich, I'd be back for a burger in no time. Prices were reasonable as I paid somewhere around the $10 mark after taxes. In addition to soft drinks and house specials, they also have a draft selection as well as bottled beers and wine. \n\nThe ticket time for the food was about 10-12 minutes which was reasonable given how busy they were. My co-worker did order a side of tots which were served prior to our main entrees, which was nice to see. A few minutes later, their burgers began to come out as did my reuben special. The reuben simply looked amazing, grilled to perfection on a nice flat top with plenty of melted cheese. I was surprised to see that it came with tots which was a nice touch.\n\nWithout waiting much longer, I took my first bite and I was in heaven. Not only was the sandwich delicious with tons of flavor, but I hadn't had anything to eat all day making it that much more savory. If there's anything I can critique on, it's that the sandwich felt a little greasy, which could of been from the melted cheese. Nevertheless the sandwich was delicious and was enjoyed nicely with a few tator tots on the side.\n\nOverall, i was very impressed with WesBurger; the food was delicious and made to order and equally important the ambiance and decor really transports you back to a time where mom and pop diners serving burgers and fries were commonplace. In a city as expensive as San Francisco, it's nice to see a success story like WesBurger who started as a popup shop to having a brick and mortar location serving nothing but tasty food with a smile.

Awesome flavor, perfectly medium rare.  My only complaints were (a) cheese wasn't melted, really at all and (b) bun was a little too thick and dense.  Something thinner or softer would be good.  I felt like I had to take the thick, thick bottom bun off to really enjoy the A+ patty.  But I'd definitely eat this again and be happy, don't get me wrong.  Way better than most other burgers in SF.  The chicken though - life changing.  I mean, SO GOOD.  It's served on buttery toast, so it envelops the chicken in this little buttery nest of deliciousness.  The chicken batter is the perfect amount of thick and crispy.  The chicken is super juicy and the spices on the Nashville version are ON POINT.  There's also tons of mayo and crispy shredded lettuce.

Begin with the burger patty itself: a custom-ground, all-brisket chuck, not smashed, but cooked with a high-enough temperature upon cast-iron to render the interior a perfect pink, and to leave a generous crust of maillard-reaction action to sweeten the deal. Add toppings: The Hot Wes ($11, a perennial favorite back at Mojo) combines viscous, salty, rich queso, crispy onion string, and jalapeno peppers for a salty, meaty, spicy nod to Wes' roots in Texas. That the brioche-style bun was perfectly toasted was simply gilding on the lilly.\n\nThe sides (namely tater-tots) remain top-notch as well.

Also on the menu: potent mac-and-cheese, country style beans, and potato salad.\n\nIn other offerings, double-fried chicken is available, either in sandwich form, or on its own. An informal poll indicates that its absolutely perfect (like everything else Wes cooks). Five taps of mid-range beer (including Fort Point and Deschutes) offer a great way to compliment your meal, and wine and punch are both available for the connoisseur. \n\nLikewise, the ambiance and service were exceptional. Even though staff-members were still getting trained, my beer glass never went empty, everyone was friendly, and my burger came out quickly. A renovated jukebox plays a well-curated selection of funk, soul, and blues, while signs for lone-star beer, and a stuffed armadillo lend a pleasant tex-mex ambiance to the red, gold, and stone walls. \n\nFive Stars: Exceptionally-well executed, fundamentally sound, cheap burgers with outstanding sides and good selection of beer.

Wes' (as I will refer to it during the rest of this review) was suggested to me by a co-worker. Since it wasn't too far from my apartment I decided to walk down and try it out that weekend.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment twice.\n\nFOOD: Funny enough I still haven't had one of Wes' burgers. The real reason I adventured over to this restaurant was to try the fabled Fried Chicken Burrito. Yes, you read that write. A dream that can be made a reality. The burrito comes fully stocked with fried chicken, corn salad, pinto beans, avocado, cheese, and salsa and by golly is it good. I've ordered it both times I've gone. Now The Mission is known for it's Mexican food and burritos so this might come under some scrutiny. But honestly you can't compare the two. This is a completely different style of burrito. Approach it with an open mind and you'll be delighted. I've also had the deluxe tots. I'm from the east coast and out there deluxe tots means you are getting chili and cheese on tots but Wes' were different. Honestly I can't even tell you what all was on the tots but I can tell you it was tasty. I can't remember the last time I ordered deluxe tots and was surprised by what was topping them. The tots themselves are almost a meal so I suggest splitting them with someone if you also want an entree. You will definitely leave with a full stomach. One day soon I'll venture back to try a burger.\n\nDRINK: Wes' has a nice selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. I normally just get water with my food but I was impressed with their beer selection.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This place has a cool atmosphere. It honestly kind of reminds of a 50's style restaurant type of atmosphere. Music isn't too loud. The tables are close to either diners but nobody bothers anyone else. There are also booths if you want a little more privacy.\n\nSTAFF: The staff doesn't wait on your tables besides dropping off the food you order at the register. So besides registering there isn't much interaction. But the staff working the register has always been super friendly and when I first dined at Wes' someone came out of the back to ask how I was enjoying my meal.

They have a table sauce when you die in that was pretty good. Not really sure what it was and the lady working there said it's had to describe, but it was like sweet, tangy, a little spicy. Made the tots edible as they were still over-fried and didn't taste like potatoes. \n\nWas feeling fat so on the way out I ordered a milkshake. I was between the buttermilk and peanut butter. The waitress recommended the peanut butter so i obliged. They also had a new flavor, horchata, which in retrospect I should have ordered since I never had one before. The peanut butter shake was just meh. The consistency wasn't that great and there was some kind of sour taste in it. Not sure if they use buttermilk in all their shakes or if it's from the peanut butter they use. Wouldn't order this shake again, but might have to stop by and try the horchata.\n\nBasically the best thing I had at this burger joint, was the friend chicken sandwich. Smh.

Wes' (as I will refer to it during the rest of this review) was suggested to me by a co-worker. Since it wasn't too far from my apartment I decided to walk down and try it out that weekend.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment twice.\n\nFOOD: Funny enough I still haven't had one of Wes' burgers. The real reason I adventured over to this restaurant was to try the fabled Fried Chicken Burrito. Yes, you read that write. A dream that can be made a reality. The burrito comes fully stocked with fried chicken, corn salad, pinto beans, avocado, cheese, and salsa and by golly is it good. I've ordered it both times I've gone. Now The Mission is known for it's Mexican food and burritos so this might come under some scrutiny. But honestly you can't compare the two. This is a completely different style of burrito. Approach it with an open mind and you'll be delighted. I've also had the deluxe tots. I'm from the east coast and out there deluxe tots means you are getting chili and cheese on tots but Wes' were different. Honestly I can't even tell you what all was on the tots but I can tell you it was tasty. I can't remember the last time I ordered deluxe tots and was surprised by what was topping them. The tots themselves are almost a meal so I suggest splitting them with someone if you also want an entree. You will definitely leave with a full stomach. One day soon I'll venture back to try a burger.\n\nDRINK: Wes' has a nice selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. I normally just get water with my food but I was impressed with their beer selection.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This place has a cool atmosphere. It honestly kind of reminds of a 50's style restaurant type of atmosphere. Music isn't too loud. The tables are close to either diners but nobody bothers anyone else. There are also booths if you want a little more privacy.\n\nSTAFF: The staff doesn't wait on your tables besides dropping off the food you order at the register. So besides registering there isn't much interaction. But the staff working the register has always been super friendly and when I first dined at Wes' someone came out of the back to ask how I was enjoying my meal. I also appreciate that.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI love trying new things. I'll go out of my way to eat something that I don't normally get in my week to week meals. Wes' takes the cake in that arena so far in my venturing around SF.
