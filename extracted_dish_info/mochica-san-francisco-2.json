First off, very cool of them to let us do that. I followed up with a call to the restaurant just to confirm and eventually started working with Victor the restaurant manager, who invited us in for a tasting and tour.\n\nWe went last night and Victor sat down with us and went through how they could set up tables for us, went through pretty much the entire menu and how we could build any kind of meal we wanted for our lunch. A la carte, family style, formal coursed dining...whatever we wanted to do. Most other places we spoke with about hosting a group our size had a fixed menu with little to no options. Really great, personalized service here.\n\nNow the food...we tried a lot of food. \n\nFirst they bring out a few purple potato chips which are great way to start the meal. Our first appetizers were Tequenos (fried cheese wonton) and Bolitas de Yucca (fried potato ball with ham and cheese). As much as I liked the Oaxaca cheese in the Tequenos, the Bolitas de Yucca are a more balanced dish. Both are very good. Followed up with beef heart and chicken anticuchos (grilled skewers). Beef heart is good, but may not be for everybody; the chicken, however, was phenomenal. Also the skewers are served with a grilled potato with huancaina sauce (similar to nacho cheese, except amazing), so good. I also tried the Cebiche Pescado and thought it was very good, although I would never claim to be a cebiche expert.\n\nFor main entrees we had the Seco de Res (short rib) which was okay, nothing particularly special, as well as the Pollo a la Brasa (rotisserie chicken) which was very well prepared. Thigh and legs were very moist; the breast dried out a little bit, but that's hard to avoid. Comes with chimichurri and aji Amarillo sauce to dip it in, which helps with the dryness of the breast, and also adds incredible flavor. I would say that even without the sauce, the chicken has great flavor. On the side, we had the Ensalada Nuovo Andina (salad with quinoa and beets) which was very good, as well as yucca fries which were delicious. We had a number of fried dishes (yucca balls, tequenos, yucca fries and churros) and none of them were oily in the least, which was impressive. \n\nAnd finally for dessert, we had mini alfajores and churros with dulce de leche and dipping hot chocolate. Alfajores were not too sweet, which some people might prefer, and the texture of the cookie was good. If you want something sweeter, the churros are probably the way to go.\n\nOverall, a really incredible meal and experience.

The only good thing was the yucca it comes with. \n\nPescado a lo macho 3/5: holy moly the coconut rice this dish comes with is SO good and addicting. The coconut is so pronounced! As for the pescado a lo macho, the sauce was pretty good and comparable to other places I've tried. Had a good consistency and flavor. I did not like the fish filet. It was overcooked and even burnt in spots. The rest of the seafood in the dish was good though. This dish is $21. I get this at my favorite Peruvian restaurant in San Mateo for $14.49. \n\nDessert: The churros were $10 for 4 small pieces. It was good and I like how it was filled with caramel, but definitely not worth $10. If I were you, I would order the panna cotta instead. It was super refreshing, light, and tasty!\n\nService: Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and patient. However, at one point one of the workers propped opened the door that was literally right next to our table. I wasn't sure why because it was freezing and the breeze was blowing directly at us, so I closed it. Then she came back and opened it again, telling me to not close it because other  customers sitting far from the door were feeling warm. So our table had to stay sit there uncomfortably cold. I felt bad for the people who were warm and we were on dessert and going to leave soon, so we just hurried and finished so we could leave.

My first experience here was definitely a 5 star experience - both for the food and wonderful service. \n\nMy husband and I came here on my birthday for lunch this past Sunday.  We were walking through Potrero on our walk back from the Dogpatch to the Mission after brunch on Saturday, and stumbled upon this cute little gem.  We had seen it before, but had never actually stopped to look at the menu.  We are huge fans of ceviche and Peruvian cuisine, so we decided to pop in on Sunday for lunch.\n\nSERVICE: As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted with the utmost hospitality.  The host gave a very warm welcome, and our server was so friendly and warm.  Both wished me a happy birthday (which my husband had mentioned in our Open Table reservation); and as soon as we'd had some time to look at the menu, the waitress offered me any drink of choice on the house in honor of my birthday.  How sweet of them, right?  \n\nDRINKS:  I opted for a spicy mezcal drink (forget the exact name of it, but it was definitely 5 stars) - normally I am a little uncertain about ordering \"specialty cocktails\" out at a restaurant because they are often too syrupy and sweet for my taste.  This was not the case - it had quite a bit of spice (which I was looking for), and the drink was perfectly balanced - only the freshest of ingredients went into the drink (fresh squeezed juice, etc.); none of that artificial pre-made syrupy stuff.  It was one of the best mixed drink I've had out at a restaurant.  \n\nMy husband selected to try the sangria (per my husband, 4.5 stars), which he was a huge fan of.  In fact, he said it was his favorite sangria that he's had since our trip last year to Spain (where he pretty much lived on sangria ;)).\n\nPart way through the meal, the waitress stopped back to check in on us - at which time my husband ordered another glass of sangria.  The waitress asked me if I liked wine (which I assured her I did), and she offered me a glass of sparkling wine on the house (by way of the manager).  This TOTALLY took me by surprise, and was so very appreciated!  Of course, I accepted the offer - and the sparkling was quite delicious :)\n\nFOOD: We were really in the mood for ceviche, so we decided to try two different kinds, along with another small plate to share.\n\nCebiche Mixto (4.5 stars): Fresh fish, mussels & clams, shrimp in lime juice-aji rocoto leche de tigre.  This dish was so fresh, citrusy, and light - the seafood was perfectly cooked, had no \"fishiness\" to it whatsoever, and everything had such great texture.  Even the calamari was tender, which many times can be chewy when not prepared properly.  I think if we had to select only one of the ceviches to order, we'd opt for this one.  But even that's hard to say, as we love both of them pretty much equally.  The only reason I'd say we'd probably go with this one is because it was the lightest tasting of the two, prepared in a style we typically feel like (citrusy, bright, fresh), and had a mixture of different kinds of seafood, which was fun.\n\nCebiche Chino (4.5 stars): Ahi tuna, ginger, scallions, rocoto-hoisin leche de tigre & toasted nori.  Obviously from the title and list of ingredients, this one had more of an \"Asian\" twist to it, with the sesame oil and ginger.  The ahi was so tender and fresh; and the addition of the fried corn-nut like additions played so well with the texture of the fish.  \n\nGrilled chicken skewer with crispy potato, salsa casera & anticucho sauce (4.5 stars):  Honestly, we could have been done and comfortably full since the portion size of each ceviches was so generous.   My husband actually said \"if they forget about the chicken skewer, I would almost be relieved.\"  But then they brought the chicken skewer - and after one bite, my husband retracted his initial statement by saying \"I take that back, this is so stupid good I am ordering this every time even if I'm too full!\"  \n\nSERVICE:  As I alluded to in the beginning, we experienced some of the best service we have ever had (even considering the $$$/$$$$ restaurants we have been to).  They had the perfect amount of attentiveness so it didn't feel like they were hovering, but any time your glass was close to empty or looked like you may need something, someone was there to attend to our needs.  And each encounter (from the manager, to waitress, to bus boys) was exceptional.  Good job Mochica, stellar experience!!!\n\nI highly recommend stopping in to Mochica.

The food was fresh, exciting and mostly authentic in a warm, attractive setting. \n\nWe went with another couple last night and were very disappointed. The location was fine and we managed to snag a parking spot just half a block away. The higher level room had Nasca lines painted on the wall - I'm not sure what was painted on the walls of the room we were in - but it didn't add to the atmosphere. \n\nOur waiter too enthusiastically approved of anything we ordered but he did answer questions and delivered food as it popped out of the kitchen.                                                       We had been to this restaurant a dozen times before and we always loved the complimentary little bowl of garbonzo beans with onion, cilantro and lime juice. It was an inventive few bites to let you know that more tasty food was on the way. That was replaced with what amounted to a thimble full of cancha (toasted large Peruvian corn) per person. When we inquired, the waiter said he'd let the chef know we missed the garbonzo concoction. \n\nThe ceviche (halibut) was fine - served with both choclo and cancha. We also had the beet salad and the dressing (maracuya - passionfruit) somewhat clashed with the sweetness of the beets. This same dressing was a perfect pairing with the green salad though, which was delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, one of the most well-known Peruvian dishes, papas a la Huancaina was a flop. Note to chef - adding bacon to a dish - doesn't necessarily improve it. When I saw it on the menu I was actually shocked (and, yes, I AM Peruvian). This dish is the mac and cheese of Peruvian cuisine - nicely cooked (usually boiled) potatoes covered in a slightly spicy cheese sauce. The sauce is yellowish from the medium spicy and fruity pepper, aji amarillo which are usually only available dried or in jars here - though I did have an admiral crop in my garden this year.

Another companion had chicken or turkey albondigas and was underwhelmed, especially when the rice she ordered with it arrived 10 minutes later even though there was only one other table occupied at that time. \n\nAnd what did the do to the platanos? They were swimming in some kind of syrup and had little flecks of cheese and drips of something, crema, perhaps. When we asked the host and waiter before ordering they said they were between ripe and green. They were definitely Maduros but the preparation left a lot to be desired. \n\nWe skipped dessert and went directly to Mitchell's to drown our sorrows. What had been an inventive, consistently great Peruvian restaurant has veered into fusion territory that fails. And we didn't even try the Peruvian version of truffled macaroni and cheese with bacon.

First off, very cool of them to let us do that. I followed up with a call to the restaurant just to confirm and eventually started working with Victor the restaurant manager, who invited us in for a tasting and tour.\n\nWe went last night and Victor sat down with us and went through how they could set up tables for us, went through pretty much the entire menu and how we could build any kind of meal we wanted for our lunch. A la carte, family style, formal coursed dining...whatever we wanted to do. Most other places we spoke with about hosting a group our size had a fixed menu with little to no options. Really great, personalized service here.\n\nNow the food...we tried a lot of food. \n\nFirst they bring out a few purple potato chips which are great way to start the meal. Our first appetizers were Tequenos (fried cheese wonton) and Bolitas de Yucca (fried potato ball with ham and cheese). As much as I liked the Oaxaca cheese in the Tequenos, the Bolitas de Yucca are a more balanced dish. Both are very good. Followed up with beef heart and chicken anticuchos (grilled skewers). Beef heart is good, but may not be for everybody; the chicken, however, was phenomenal. Also the skewers are served with a grilled potato with huancaina sauce (similar to nacho cheese, except amazing), so good. I also tried the Cebiche Pescado and thought it was very good, although I would never claim to be a cebiche expert.\n\nFor main entrees we had the Seco de Res (short rib) which was okay, nothing particularly special, as well as the Pollo a la Brasa (rotisserie chicken) which was very well prepared. Thigh and legs were very moist; the breast dried out a little bit, but that's hard to avoid. Comes with chimichurri and aji Amarillo sauce to dip it in, which helps with the dryness of the breast, and also adds incredible flavor. I would say that even without the sauce, the chicken has great flavor. On the side, we had the Ensalada Nuovo Andina (salad with quinoa and beets) which was very good, as well as yucca fries which were delicious. We had a number of fried dishes (yucca balls, tequenos, yucca fries and churros) and none of them were oily in the least, which was impressive. \n\nAnd finally for dessert, we had mini alfajores and churros with dulce de leche and dipping hot chocolate. Alfajores were not too sweet, which some people might prefer, and the texture of the cookie was good. If you want something sweeter, the churros are probably the way to go.\n\nOverall, a really incredible meal and experience. We look forward to going back to sample more of the menu and finalize our lunch menu.

As much as I liked the Oaxaca cheese in the Tequenos, the Bolitas de Yucca are a more balanced dish. Both are very good. Followed up with beef heart and chicken anticuchos (grilled skewers).

Also the skewers are served with a grilled potato with huancaina sauce (similar to nacho cheese, except amazing), so good. I also tried the Cebiche Pescado and thought it was very good, although I would never claim to be a cebiche expert.\n\nFor main entrees we had the Seco de Res (short rib) which was okay, nothing particularly special, as well as the Pollo a la Brasa (rotisserie chicken) which was very well prepared. Thigh and legs were very moist; the breast dried out a little bit, but that's hard to avoid. Comes with chimichurri and aji Amarillo sauce to dip it in, which helps with the dryness of the breast, and also adds incredible flavor.

The portion isn't huge, but in honesty it's probably the amount of food you're supposed to eat.\n\nwe stayed late, like really late.  It was probably almost 11:30 when we left.  They probably hated us on the inside, but were really nice and friendly even when we left.  Much points for being nice.\n\nOn the slightly down side\n\nThe wait staff is working out the kinks I think.  Now I realize that I am at a peruvian restaurant, but that doesn't mean any of us speak Spanish.  Where the bartender took the time to explain things, the wait staff glossed over things.\n\nwhen our food came out, the first waiter said seafood paella.  and put it down for those who ordered it.  Then the second waiter came, and he said seafood paella!  we were so confused...turns out the first dish was the fried rice.  Not a big deal.  just kind of funny that none of us were bright enough to say hey where's the seafood in this paella...\n\nLater when the pork shoulder came out, we asked if it was the pork shoulder.  Incorrect Seafood paella waiter said, \"it's the chancho adobado\", which ok maybe we should've remembered the name of it...so we asked again, does that mean pork shoulder?  and he again says chancho adobado, before i think realizing we weren't getting it and says oh yes pork shoulder.  Again not a big deal.\n\nAlso got the churros which were really highly rated.  Was a bit disappointed in this, maybe it's because they have filling they don't hold up as well when you bite into it.  It shatters and you're left to eat small pieces like hanover pretzel pieces.\n\nLastly, and probably again due to my ignorance/not being smart enough to use google translate, when I think Peruvian (maybe I'm biased), it means an awesome rotisserie chicken to me.  It's on the menu, but apparently as wifester later pointed out to me, \"el special del fin de semana\" seems to mean \"weekend special\".

It was tasty comfort food albeit heavy on the carbs.\n\nI ordered the $22 Seafood Paella which put a Peruvian twist on a Spanish favorite by using a saffron-pimento sauce over the bomba rice. Mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari were mixed in to make it a most seaworthy dish topped with red onions for a bit of crunch (photo: http://bit.ly/2teQRaE).

Flavor was good and the sauce had a nice heat, but as it was baby octopus, there wasn't much meat, but they were abundant in quantity. \n\nPrice: pricey, but wouldn't have mattered if the quality was good, but overpriced given the lack of quality. \n\nI'm surprised this place has a 4 star rating and Lim\u00f3n has 3.5 stars.

The reviews on yelp were positive and the food just looked delicious! Overall, I was disappointed because it didn't taste like authentic Peruvian food, which is what I was craving, but the Pork Belly Chaufa made up for it!\n\nPlantain Chips (3.5/4 stars): I thought these were amazing but it's because I love banana chips in general and this one was perfectly crispy with some sugar on it. \n\nAhi Tuna Ceviche (2.5 stars): The Ahi Tuna itself was good but the sauce was just sweet and sour chili sauce (the sauce you dip eggrolls in). I didn't like this dish because it was all sweet with no salty or sour to balance it. I was expecting that sweet but sour to the point where your mouth hurts (I exaggerate, but, really though..). I would come back to try the Ceviche Mixto or Ceviche Pescado to taste how they make it. I just have this expectation of the Ceviche Mixto at Balcones in Los Angeles. SO. GOOD.  \n\nLomo Saltado (3 stars): The fries looked like mcdonalds fries. Let that soak in. Can you feel my sadness? Every lomo saltado I've had, the fries has always resembled steak cut fries. I have never seen skinny fries on lomo saltado. I thought maybe I was just being picky but my friend had the same sad look in his eyes also. Anyways, the dish itself was alright/good but it was missing that kick of soy sauce and vinegar flavor that gives lomo saltado that burst of flavor. If you like a more meaty/beef flavor (I mean, who doesn't?) then you'll like this! \n\nPork Belly Chaufa (4 stars): This was my favorite dish of the night. Very flavorful, and the cubed pieces of pork belly just melts in your mouth. The only thing about this dish is that I'm not sure how \"Peruvian\" it is (not that it has to be authentic since Peruvian food is a mash up of several different cultural foods to begin with). It reminded me of Korean Kim chi Fried Rice but without the pieces of kim chi. Besides that, this dish was delicious and I gave it 4 stars because I would order it again.\n\nWe made reservations and the service was great. The price ranged from $15 - $20, which is normal for SF.

To ceviche their own though. - #noodosisters on IG\n\nMy Peruvian friend and I were both craving Peruvian food and decided to try Mochica. The reviews on yelp were positive and the food just looked delicious! Overall, I was disappointed because it didn't taste like authentic Peruvian food, which is what I was craving, but the Pork Belly Chaufa made up for it!\n\nPlantain Chips (3.5/4 stars): I thought these were amazing but it's because I love banana chips in general and this one was perfectly crispy with some sugar on it. \n\nAhi Tuna Ceviche (2.5 stars): The Ahi Tuna itself was good but the sauce was just sweet and sour chili sauce (the sauce you dip eggrolls in). I didn't like this dish because it was all sweet with no salty or sour to balance it. I was expecting that sweet but sour to the point where your mouth hurts (I exaggerate, but, really though..). I would come back to try the Ceviche Mixto or Ceviche Pescado to taste how they make it. I just have this expectation of the Ceviche Mixto at Balcones in Los Angeles. SO. GOOD.  \n\nLomo Saltado (3 stars): The fries looked like mcdonalds fries. Let that soak in. Can you feel my sadness? Every lomo saltado I've had, the fries has always resembled steak cut fries. I have never seen skinny fries on lomo saltado. I thought maybe I was just being picky but my friend had the same sad look in his eyes also. Anyways, the dish itself was alright/good but it was missing that kick of soy sauce and vinegar flavor that gives lomo saltado that burst of flavor. If you like a more meaty/beef flavor (I mean, who doesn't?) then you'll like this! \n\nPork Belly Chaufa (4 stars): This was my favorite dish of the night. Very flavorful, and the cubed pieces of pork belly just melts in your mouth. The only thing about this dish is that I'm not sure how \"Peruvian\" it is (not that it has to be authentic since Peruvian food is a mash up of several different cultural foods to begin with). It reminded me of Korean Kim chi Fried Rice but without the pieces of kim chi. Besides that, this dish was delicious and I gave it 4 stars because I would order it again.\n\nWe made reservations and the service was great. The price ranged from $15 - $20, which is normal for SF.

I don't remember the one that i had, it was with ginger beer though.  We couldn't really taste the difference between the tamarind one and the spicy one that our table ordered, but they were good.  But if I were to get a drink I'd probably get the pisco sour.  Wifester had it, it was good.\n\nThe table ordered a combination of:\n\nchicharrones de pollo (chicken thigh app)\ncostillita de chancho (ribs app)\n\nIt was a close vote, but we enjoyed the ribs a bit more.\n\nFor entrees we had seafood paella, arroz chaufa (chinese inspired peruvian fried rice!) and chancho adobado (pork shoulder).\n\nThey all had good flavor, just nothing that really wowed us or made you want to steal the other person's plate.  The portion isn't huge, but in honesty it's probably the amount of food you're supposed to eat.\n\nwe stayed late, like really late.  It was probably almost 11:30 when we left.  They probably hated us on the inside, but were really nice and friendly even when we left.  Much points for being nice.\n\nOn the slightly down side\n\nThe wait staff is working out the kinks I think.  Now I realize that I am at a peruvian restaurant, but that doesn't mean any of us speak Spanish.  Where the bartender took the time to explain things, the wait staff glossed over things.\n\nwhen our food came out, the first waiter said seafood paella.  and put it down for those who ordered it.  Then the second waiter came, and he said seafood paella!  we were so confused...turns out the first dish was the fried rice.  Not a big deal.  just kind of funny that none of us were bright enough to say hey where's the seafood in this paella...\n\nLater when the pork shoulder came out, we asked if it was the pork shoulder.  Incorrect Seafood paella waiter said, \"it's the chancho adobado\", which ok maybe we should've remembered the name of it...so we asked again, does that mean pork shoulder?  and he again says chancho adobado, before i think realizing we weren't getting it and says oh yes pork shoulder.  Again not a big deal.\n\nAlso got the churros which were really highly rated.  Was a bit disappointed in this, maybe it's because they have filling they don't hold up as well when you bite into it.  It shatters and you're left to eat small pieces like hanover pretzel pieces.\n\nLastly, and probably again due to my ignorance/not being smart enough to use google translate, when I think Peruvian (maybe I'm biased), it means an awesome rotisserie chicken to me.  It's on the menu, but apparently as wifester later pointed out to me, \"el special del fin de semana\" seems to mean \"weekend special\".

First off, very cool of them to let us do that. I followed up with a call to the restaurant just to confirm and eventually started working with Victor the restaurant manager, who invited us in for a tasting and tour.\n\nWe went last night and Victor sat down with us and went through how they could set up tables for us, went through pretty much the entire menu and how we could build any kind of meal we wanted for our lunch. A la carte, family style, formal coursed dining...whatever we wanted to do. Most other places we spoke with about hosting a group our size had a fixed menu with little to no options. Really great, personalized service here.\n\nNow the food...we tried a lot of food. \n\nFirst they bring out a few purple potato chips which are great way to start the meal. Our first appetizers were Tequenos (fried cheese wonton) and Bolitas de Yucca (fried potato ball with ham and cheese). As much as I liked the Oaxaca cheese in the Tequenos, the Bolitas de Yucca are a more balanced dish. Both are very good. Followed up with beef heart and chicken anticuchos (grilled skewers). Beef heart is good, but may not be for everybody; the chicken, however, was phenomenal. Also the skewers are served with a grilled potato with huancaina sauce (similar to nacho cheese, except amazing), so good. I also tried the Cebiche Pescado and thought it was very good, although I would never claim to be a cebiche expert.\n\nFor main entrees we had the Seco de Res (short rib) which was okay, nothing particularly special, as well as the Pollo a la Brasa (rotisserie chicken) which was very well prepared. Thigh and legs were very moist; the breast dried out a little bit, but that's hard to avoid. Comes with chimichurri and aji Amarillo sauce to dip it in, which helps with the dryness of the breast, and also adds incredible flavor. I would say that even without the sauce, the chicken has great flavor. On the side, we had the Ensalada Nuovo Andina (salad with quinoa and beets) which was very good, as well as yucca fries which were delicious. We had a number of fried dishes (yucca balls, tequenos, yucca fries and churros) and none of them were oily in the least, which was impressive. \n\nAnd finally for dessert, we had mini alfajores and churros with dulce de leche and dipping hot chocolate. Alfajores were not too sweet, which some people might prefer, and the texture of the cookie was good.

For food, we shared 6?tapas style dishes and 1 dessert between the 4 of us. \n\nCeviche (5/5) \nSo juicy! This ceviche consists of large chunks of fish, calamari rings, mussels, and shrimp. Sooo flavorful, one of the best ceviches I've had in a while. The seafood is tender and the portion is generous. \n\nChicharrones style fried chicken (5/5) \nSimilar to Spanish fried chicken-the pieces were small, bite sized but so tender and full of flavor. The batter is not overpowering and the meat to coating ratio is prime. Came with a creamy sauce and a salsa-esque sauce to dip. Would recommend! \n\nMushroom empanadas (3.5/5) \nCame with 2 per order and were pretty large. The mushrooms inside were juicy, but nothing to write home about for the skins. \n\nPaella (4.5/5) \nTasty and a good amount of seafood in it! But this paella was wetter than most I've had (I prefer a little drier). Regardless, the flavors were there and overall a really good dish. \n\nPork belly choufa (3.5/5)\nFried rice with pork belly chunks in a tomato-ey sauce. Flavors were pretty good, but a little too greasy for my taste. Atop the rice there was also a creamy sauce but I think we could've done without. \n\nCalamari relleno (3/5) \nPersonally I think the meat filling should stay in a fried potato ball..not calamari. Still it was an interesting dish to try! Comes in 2 pieces, but I didn't think the flavors were toooo cohesive. \n\nChurros (4.5/5)\nYum!! Comes with 4, Dulce de lece freshly made churros. The hot chocolate seemed like the actual hot chocolate drink, but I was expecting the melted chocolate. A good way to finish off dinner! \n\nOverall, a great place to explore different types of Peruvian (fusion) food! Everything was fun to eat and portions were decently sized.

He promptly gave us a food menu, a cocktail menu and blue potato chips with a really good lemon onion dipping juice. \n\nIt was really hard choosing a cocktail since there were so many and they all seemed delicious. I went with bitter sweet love which is a light pink with lemon peel garnish served in a martini glass. It was sweet and definitely on the bitter side so the name suits it. My boyfriend had the Summer diet which was also served in a martini glass with a light green color and cucumber garnish. It really was refreshing. \n\nTo start we had a chorizo empanada, ceviche peruano chino, and anticuches of beef heart. Everything was so good. The anticuchos were definitely my favorite very meaty and cooked perfectly to a medium with anticuchera sauce and I believe chimichurri with a potato that had some kind of creamy sauce.\n\nDinner took us awhile since we met some cool people at the bar and Tony also engaged with us. It was really fun. \n\nFor the main course we had pork belly chaufa and the salmon bandido. The chaufa was rich in flavor and filling. The salmon was tender and cooked to the point of juciness.

Just like many of the other surrounding restaurants, you can also expect good food and friendly service at Mochica.  Reservations recommended.  It was super packed by 7 PM on a Friday.  About the food...\n\nYou MUST GET the Calamari Relleno (calamari stuffed with chorizo and sauce).  OMG, THIS WAS SO GOOD.  This was for sure my favorite dish of the night.\n\nOther dishes we tried included the Papa a la Huancaina (the potatoes were good and the bacon was a nice addition, but there were small pieces of olives in it, and I hate olives.  :c), Pollo a la Brasa w/ fries (YES - the cheese and chimchurri... YES YES YES.

Not a fun spot. However, they took over the former Rocketfish space on Potrero Hill about 2-1/2 years ago. I suggested it to Jamie W. since I've been to their sister operation in Walnut Creek, Parada New Peru (review: http://bit.ly/2sn44xW) and thought a little Peruvian would be nice for a change. It was pretty packed on a Thursday evening, and the hostess was the type who gave us small-mouth when she talked while she looked right past us. I hate that.\n\nAnyway, the moment we were seated, we received the bad news that they were out of the $15.50 Pollo a la Brasa. Say what? It was only 7:30PM, and they were out of their signature dish. Damn. We waved the server away as we composed ourselves, all the while munching on the oil-lacquered corn kernels left for us to Hoover (photo: http://bit.ly/2tzDx04). Jamie decided to be the more adventurous one and ordered the $19 Aji de Gallina, which was a shredded chicken breast braised in an aji amarillo sauce which was intensely creamy. It came with diced potatoes, Botija olives, jasmine rice, and half a hard-boiled egg on top (photo: http://bit.ly/2rCXWol). It was tasty comfort food albeit heavy on the carbs.\n\nI ordered the $22 Seafood Paella which put a Peruvian twist on a Spanish favorite by using a saffron-pimento sauce over the bomba rice. Mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari were mixed in to make it a most seaworthy dish topped with red onions for a bit of crunch (photo: http://bit.ly/2teQRaE). It was also tasty in a starchy, no-frills kind of way and genuinely satisfying. Surprisingly the high point of our meal was the $7 Grilled Asparagus with a creamy aji-style sauce for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/2tescTP).

We loved the calamari...it looked a little dorky ( like a carrot sculpture) but oh yum. It was stuffed with chorizo and had a walnut sauce, and simple salad ( arugula maybe?) with red onion in a really citrus-y vinaigrette. \nI would definitely get that again.
