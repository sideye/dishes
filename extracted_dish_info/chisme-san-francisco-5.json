To get straight to the point, everything was delicious, the decor of the restaurant looks fantastic, and the woman at the counter couldn't have been nicer. \n\nOf the two different types of tacos we ordered, I personally like the jackfruit one a tiny bit more; the mint verde that was lathered on top of the cabbage in the taco was my favorite part of the taco. Our only criticism with the skirt steak taco is that the meat itself could've been cut a bit more, into smaller bit size pieces. With how the meat is cut right now, there's a good chance your first bite pulls out the entire piece of meat, leaving you with a meatless taco. Be sure to grab extra napkins for the skirt steak taco too! The (delicious) mole sauce is going to be dripping all over your hands once you're through with the taco.

There are few things better than cheese on a cob of corn on a stick. You won't regret it.\n\nReading through the other Yelp reviews, it seems like people's primary criticism of Chisme is that the prices are too high, and that you can't mix and match the tacos. I disagree on both these points. The prices are perfectly reasonable for what you're getting, and you'll definitely be full after having an order of tacos. Not specific to Chisme, but to all restaurants in general: if the restaurant publishes its prices (which Chisme does), if you're unhappy with the pricing, just don't go; nobody's forcing you to.

They charged an extra $2.75 for extra chips as well. \n\nI'm hoping it was just a one time incident in regards to bland tacos. As far as price goes, I think the chips and guacamole were a little overpriced. At least offer more chips and present the chips and guacamole in actual porcelain/ceramic bowls if you're going to charge that much. I could purchase a whole bag of chips for the price of adding more chips to the 14-chips I received... \n\nRegardless, I do love that Chisme offers good vibes and a fresh take on Mexican food... The Counter seating by the window would definitely be a great spot to people watch. \n\nI'm a full supporter of all the restaurants popping up in our Tendernob neighborhood. Hence, I'm hoping this review would be seen more constructively so I could continue to show some love to the growing Tendernob family community of restaurants and bars.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-10-02"}, {"excerpts": ["My husband had the skirt steak tacos and loved them!

To get straight to the point, everything was delicious, the decor of the restaurant looks fantastic, and the woman at the counter couldn't have been nicer. \n\nOf the two different types of tacos we ordered, I personally like the jackfruit one a tiny bit more; the mint verde that was lathered on top of the cabbage in the taco was my favorite part of the taco. Our only criticism with the skirt steak taco is that the meat itself could've been cut a bit more, into smaller bit size pieces. With how the meat is cut right now, there's a good chance your first bite pulls out the entire piece of meat, leaving you with a meatless taco. Be sure to grab extra napkins for the skirt steak taco too! The (delicious) mole sauce is going to be dripping all over your hands once you're through with the taco. Overall, both tacos were carefully thought out in composition and I can definitely appreciate that.\n\nIf you've never had elote before, be sure to order one at Chisme! There are few things better than cheese on a cob of corn on a stick. You won't regret it.\n\nReading through the other Yelp reviews, it seems like people's primary criticism of Chisme is that the prices are too high, and that you can't mix and match the tacos. I disagree on both these points. The prices are perfectly reasonable for what you're getting, and you'll definitely be full after having an order of tacos. Not specific to Chisme, but to all restaurants in general: if the restaurant publishes its prices (which Chisme does), if you're unhappy with the pricing, just don't go; nobody's forcing you to. Re: mixing and matching, I've got a solution for you: come with a friend! Just order two and share :)\n\n5/5 experience, definitely coming back to Chisme.", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-01-27"}, {"excerpts": ["For dinner, we had the Via Via (Fried Plaintain) tacos and the Jackfruit tacos.

I knew I had to try it out asap. (That fiery 'Hot & New' business flame only lasts so long!)\n\nLocated off Sutter & Leavenworth, it mirrors power-player Liholiho and the faux-bougie corporate l*ser Papa John's. If I lived in the direct area, I'd be happy to see this new affordable, fresh, and delicious restaurant opening up.\n\nReading the reviews, it seems like a lot of Yelpers are complaining about the \"expensive prices\" of these tacos. Come on people, have you not been to Tacolicious or Nick's Crispy Tacos? This is not your average hole-in-the-wall taqueria. As much as I love my $2 tacos filled with beans and rice, this place offers a more modern take on Mexican cuisine with eclectic ingredients. Could you find fried plantain tacos at a standard taqueria? Don't think so. The diverse ingredients equate to a slightly higher price, but I don't believe it is priced exorbitantly. \n\nFor dinner, we had the Via Via (Fried Plaintain) tacos and the Jackfruit tacos. We also had the Papas Rojas with Mole Sauce, and draft beer to round the meal out.\n\nBoth tacos were delicious! The Fried plaintains were paired with refried black beans which were a delicious blend of sweet & savory. They fried the jackfruit, which gave it a crunchy texture. This paired very nicely with their fresh greens and mint verde. The mole sauce on the papas rojas was so good! Crispy potatoes topped with a savory white sauce. Yum! \nAlso, don't forget about their spicy green salsa. It definitely has a kick to it!\n\nThey offer bottled beer and wine, but we opted for the draft. I forgot what the brand of beer it was, but we went for the Cascade Sunshine, which is a light IPA. It paired very nicely with our meal.\n\nIf I had to nitpick something, I wish we could mix & match tacos. Since all the vegan tacos are $8 for 2, maybe at least we could mix and match the vegan options? Or maybe mix and match, but reflect the price of the higher priced taco. [Ex: Someone buys a steak & shrimp taco, it would still be $11 for the two].\n\nOverall, Chisme offers delicious tacos in a cozy environment at a decent price.

If I lived in the direct area, I'd be happy to see this new affordable, fresh, and delicious restaurant opening up.\n\nReading the reviews, it seems like a lot of Yelpers are complaining about the \"expensive prices\" of these tacos. Come on people, have you not been to Tacolicious or Nick's Crispy Tacos? This is not your average hole-in-the-wall taqueria. As much as I love my $2 tacos filled with beans and rice, this place offers a more modern take on Mexican cuisine with eclectic ingredients. Could you find fried plantain tacos at a standard taqueria? Don't think so. The diverse ingredients equate to a slightly higher price, but I don't believe it is priced exorbitantly. \n\nFor dinner, we had the Via Via (Fried Plaintain) tacos and the Jackfruit tacos. We also had the Papas Rojas with Mole Sauce, and draft beer to round the meal out.\n\nBoth tacos were delicious! The Fried plaintains were paired with refried black beans which were a delicious blend of sweet & savory. They fried the jackfruit, which gave it a crunchy texture. This paired very nicely with their fresh greens and mint verde. The mole sauce on the papas rojas was so good! Crispy potatoes topped with a savory white sauce. Yum! \nAlso, don't forget about their spicy green salsa. It definitely has a kick to it!\n\nThey offer bottled beer and wine, but we opted for the draft. I forgot what the brand of beer it was, but we went for the Cascade Sunshine, which is a light IPA. It paired very nicely with our meal.\n\nIf I had to nitpick something, I wish we could mix & match tacos. Since all the vegan tacos are $8 for 2, maybe at least we could mix and match the vegan options? Or maybe mix and match, but reflect the price of the higher priced taco. [Ex: Someone buys a steak & shrimp taco, it would still be $11 for the two].\n\nOverall, Chisme offers delicious tacos in a cozy environment at a decent price.

Guacamole tasted very fresh and the food was all scratch made as expected. Try the coconut horchata or regret it! \n\nService was quick and the staff was very professional. My friends and I enjoyed the fun ambiance and we did not feel rushed even though there was a line out the door. The couple next to us had the elotes and said it was fantastic, definitely getting it next time.

Walking in, I felt instantly calmed by the beautiful details of the place; the Fnnch mural, the simplistic light fixtures, the 'magic' pink water... Everything in there made me want to stay.\n\nGreeted by a huge smile, we gathered some information about the menu before deciding on the skirt steak tacos ($11), the shrimp tacos ($10), and the cauliflower ceviche ($7). The food was out in a prompt fashion, and our taste buds lit up when we took our first bite. Holy moly peanut butter MOLE. These flavors WORK. Every bite was just like the first - magical. Adding the lime wedge to the cauliflower ceviche gave it an acidity that perfect the dish, and the staff brought more chips as soon as we finished the first batch.\n\nWe were so blown away that we decided to go in for dessert as well. We had a hard time deciding between the Sweet Chimichanga ($7) and the Caramel Churros ($7). However, we had no regrets when our caramel stuffed churros arrived with the sweetest, homemade whipped cream. Every.Damn.Bite was incredible. I have never enjoyed a churro so wholeheartedly.\n\nSo yes, come here. This is a humble restaurant serving some of the best damn food around at a totally affordable place. I am #blessed to live just around the corner and will be a frequent visitor here!", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-01-22"}, {"excerpts": ["The Caramel Churros!!! ", "Omg they are worth getting!

The atmosphere was pretty hipster, a little different from a taqueria but very pleasant. The workers were all very nice and helpful, suggesting very good things they definitely know their menu!\n\nThe first thing i got was a white wine sangria, very good and refreshing! The freshly cut apples in it were so crisp and worth trying! \n\nNext i ordered the steak tacos and man were they good, there was so much flavor! Nicely cooked, not chewy or anything. One this i hate about steak tacos is that if i take a bite, the whole piece of steak of steak will come out but that did not happen which made the meal enjoyable. I also had a shrimp taco that my bf had and it's not one of this tacos that barely have any shrimp, i had shrimp in every bite and it was in this sauce that had some spice so it has a slight kick but not spicy. It was topped with a salsa that had mangos and they weren't this giant diced tomatoes and mangos, its was a small dice which made eating pretty easy. Both the tacos were soooo good! But the spicy sauce that they usually ask if you want, it is SOOOO SPICY! Just a warning.\n\nDrum roll to my favorite part of my meal! The Caramel Churros!!! Omg they are worth getting! Homemade cream and the churros have a caramel Creme on the inside! Uuuugh i want more!! And let me tell you that i don't like sweets but these churros were just soooooo good! Everyone needs to try them!\n\nOverall, would come back here again! :)", "rating": 5, "date": "2018-01-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Dessert\n\nHad the caramel churros with chocolate sauce and home made whipped cream.

Vegetarian and vegan friendly\n\nPersonally not huge on the jackfruit but the eggplant tacos were amazing. Breaded eggplant with peanut mole. Recommending adding the guacamole on top.\n\nThe mashed potato bowl is delicious and comforting\n\nThe quesadilla is one of my favorites in the city. The tortilla is super light and flaky, just perfect!\n\n2. Beverages\n\nThere's a selection of wine and beer. For those who like strong ginger drinks, they have a great ginger tonic that packs a punch. \n\n3. Dessert\n\nHad the caramel churros with chocolate sauce and home made whipped cream.
