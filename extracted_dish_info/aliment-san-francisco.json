I should have known that day of reservations were too good to be true.\n\nThe eatery itself is very attractive.  It is a lovely neighborhood restaurant on the corner of Mason and Bush.  There are four booths on the first floor that accommodate 4-6, a few high tops and a full bar with seating of six.  There were also tables on the second floor. They are doing the modern bistro - kitchen towel napkins, no tablecloths, little plants, etc. You know the vibe.  FYI: Ventilation is an issue; hot on the second floor and cold on the first floor.\n\nWe ordered the burger for the LOs to split, which they were nice enough to do in the back. The $18 burger was slightly overcooked (more medium than medium rare) and underseasoned. It had nice aged cheddar but the bacon jam and chipotle aioli were undetectable. It was served with fries and spicy pickles. It was totally edible but not at all wow.\n\nMeanwhile, we had cocktails, DM had a Kentucky Mule and I had the spice table. The Ketucky Mule was a-ok - lots of lime with bourbon and a bit of ginger beer. It was bartender's choice - not very imaginative but a-ok.  I ordered the Spice Trail, which was a bourbon based drink with a ginger turmeric elixir with lemon. It was not a very balanced drink - a little cloudy and bitter. Drinkable (who wastes good bourbon?!?!) but definitely not my fave.\n\nThe Brussels Sprouts were the highlight of the evening and are worth a trip on their own. Super crunchy sprouts in fish sauce that stay crunchy. OMG. These were heavenly. The cauliflower saute was okay.  The first couple of bites that I had (and the last couple of bites that DM had) were off. We suspect it was rancid oil that was drizzled at center. Otherwise,the caramelized cauliflower with golden raisins, capers and Parmesan were very good.\n\nThings went downhill. Nothing here is inedible,but I have had so much better. The mussels had only one piece of chorizo - false advertising - and half of them were chock full of grit. The lager sauce and braised red cabbage were a nice alternative preparation to the dish.  The New York Strip requested rare was more like flank steak cooked medium rare. The roasted sweet potatoes were nice, crispy and generous. The mustard inflected rutabega puree was lovely but inadequate. The meat was riddled with gristle and passed onto the human garbage disposers in the group.\n\nConsidering the hit and miss nature of the menu and the lacking cocktails, we went elsewhere for our nightcap. The service was friendly, albeit not very attentive.  \n\nI am really disappointed that this place has 4 stars on Yelp.

Quick, easy fix. Some servers were dressed in a business casual way that made them tough to identify, and the bartender's shirt speaks for itself ha\n-Hire an interior designer to give the place some simple color/pattern concepts. As mentioned above, fake-looking veneer wood and basic table/chairs make the place look cheaper than it should\n-Decide which vibe you're shooting for. If that's happy hour, great, go for it. If that's more of a dinner restaurant, the projected TV on the wall showing ESPN2 is far more of a detractor than a benefit. You can even keep the TVs and just shut them down at a certain time, or switch to a more compelling/ambience-building channel than a B-level college basketball game that no one is watching.\n-If you're offering cocktails, make sure they're well made. If not, stick to beer, wine, and well. \n\n\nThis place certainly has potential and I think they could make a few quick changes to improve the experience substantially, but for now I would recommend friends to skip it.

It is also decently priced too and great wine list. \n\nItems that I ordered: \n- Fried Brussels Sprouts w/ fish sauce caramel, toasted nori, sesame seeds\n- Ricotta Gnocchi w/ english pea pesto\n- Lamb Sirloin w/ tatziki, harrissa, zatar spice \n\n**menu always changes", "rating": 4, "date": "2015-08-18"}, {"excerpts": ["The breast meat ended up kind of dry, but it was a really big portion\n- Ricotta gnocchi: definitely add pork belly for texture and flavor; the gnocchi was very pillowy, but it would have been nice to have a sear on it for some extra texture.

There was a bathroom on the floor, too, which was convenient.  \n\nWe started with a bunch of cocktail orders, but two of the drinks we requested were unavailable because they didn't have the ingredients. It was disappointing, but they were really nice about letting us choose alternative drinks and not charging us for them!  \n\nDrinks that we did end up getting:\n- George's dragon: strong on the vinegar and ginger, but interesting  \n- Caipirihna de framboesa: a little sweet for me, but you can taste the cachaca, which is nice  \n- Marley in the mountains: interesting combination of flavors, but I'm not a huge fan of the singani 63\n\nFood: \n- Brussels sprouts: with fish sauce caramel. The brussels sprouts were nicely roasted, and the sauce was a good mix of savory and sweet. I liked this a lot\n- Chickpea meatballs: good texture, and the harissa glaze, feta, and tomato chutney had lots of flavor\n- Korean fried chicken: good sauce, but I wish there were more of it. The breast meat ended up kind of dry, but it was a really big portion\n- Ricotta gnocchi: definitely add pork belly for texture and flavor; the gnocchi was very pillowy, but it would have been nice to have a sear on it for some extra texture. It's also a big portion, and I think it's better for sharing\n- Salmon cakes: the salmon itself was fine, but I liked the stuff underneath more - sunchoke puree, roasted mushrooms, beets, salsify\n- Kurobuta pork chop: good flavor but unfortunately dry\n\nI would get the brussels sprouts and chickpea meatballs again - I think the appetizers were the highlight.  Overall, portions were big, and the value is pretty good, but none of the mains were amazing. \n\nI was worried we would get ignored since we were the only people on that floor, but our server was great about checking in, refilling water, etc.", "rating": 3, "date": "2017-02-12"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Brussel Sprouts and the Ricotta Gnocchi with Pork Belly and perfect for the both of us."], "author": "Leslie M.", "review": "Aliment was a great restaurant to visit since they were so close to our hotel, but also because the food was delicious!
