Made a reservation through OpenTable the day before for a party of 6 on Saturday, September 8th at 5:30pm. We were a party of 5 adults and 1 toddler.\n\n*ONION RINGS ($13)\n*JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL OR REMOULADE ($18)\n*MARYLAND-STYLE CRAB CAKE: With Honey Mustard Sauce ($19)\n*FRIED CALAMARI: with Cocktail Sauce ($16)\n*CAESAR SALAD: with Croutons ($14)\n*Kid's Mac n' Cheese ($9)\n\nEveryone just named an appetizer that they wanted and we ended up with the plates above. I'm a veggie girl, so I enjoyed the caesar. The onion rings are massive! You get a huge stack of them. The crab cake was kinda small for five to share, but since we had so many apps, cutting it up into a few servings was fine. The shrimp cocktail and calamari were pretty standard and tasty. They have a kid's menu, so the first thing we ordered was the mac n cheese. A pretty big serving for a kid sized meal. They give you complimentary bread and butter and jar of pickled cucumbers and red bell peppers, so make sure to sample that. I liked the pickles, but I found the peppers a little slimy.\n\nSTEAKS & CHOPS: All entrees are served with a glazed carrot and choice of baked potato, smashed potatoes or skillet fried potatoes which are topped with saut\u00e9ed onions and peppercorn gravy\n*PRIME RIBEYE: 14oz. ($49) x2\n*PRIME \"C\u00d4TE DE BOEUF\" BONE-IN RIBEYE: 22oz. ($62)\n*PRIME FILET MIGNON: 9oz. ($49)\n*PRIME T-BONE: 16oz. ($52)\n\n*SAUT\u00c9ED MUSHROOMS ($11)\n*FRESH ASPARAGUS ($11)\n*ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($10)\n\nThe bone in ribeye looked delicious! Definitely the most impressive looking steak. I got the 14oz ribeye which I found a little fatty at spots. The skillet potatoes were tasty and my fav out of the potato sides. I tried the mashed potatoes too and they had a good amount of garlic flavor. I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots, so I left that alone. The sides were nice and simple. Asparagus and mushrooms are two of my favorite veggies, so I enjoyed those. I didn't try the brussels, but they looked good as well.\n\n*BROWNIE SUNDAE: A Peanut Butter and Chocolate Brownie with Triple Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Topped with Pecan Chocolate Butter Nut Sauce, Whipped Cream and a Cherry\n*Chandon Brut Classic ($15 glass)\n*Cliff Lede Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon 2014 ($145 bottle)\n\nSince it was my bday, the restaurant gave us a complimentary dessert. If you are a chocolate lover, this is a good dessert to share as it's huge. The bottle of red wine we ordered waa nice and full bodied. Definitely went well with red meat. I started with a glass of bubbly as I was the first one here. Nice to sip on while waiting.\n\nService was weird. Our server asked us if we were ready to order and I said we'll order some apps. I started naming apps and he just walked away to help another table. So strange! We wanted to try the pickle jar with our apps, but he took that away without asking. I had to inquire later with our steaks to get the jar back.\n\nI was ready to give this spot four stars, but due to the odd service, I'm bumping it down to three. Otherwise, a nice old school spot to grab a steak.

But, in our defense, we had a guest who was on East Coast time, so for him it was 8:15 p.m.  No one was at the host podium.  After we hovered around the podium for a bit, a waiter (fortunately, not the one who waited on us) came up to the podium.  Before I could even tell him that we were early for a 5:30 p.m. reservation, he spit out, \"Not open until 5:30!\"  I explained, \"We're early for a 5:30 reservation.\"  He snarled \"We aren't open until 5:30!\"  In response, I said  \"Oh okay, I guess we'll wait at the bar across the way?\"  He then just walked away.  \n\nI found his demeanor and attitude rude and offensive.  He could have politely suggested that we wait in the lobby or grab a drink at the bar across the hallway until they opened at 5:30 p.m.\n\nFortunately, after grabbing a cocktail across the hallway (which was seamlessly transferred to our dinner bill), and checking in with who I assume is the regular hostess, we were promptly seated and waited on by a much more pleasant waiter and busboy.\n\nOur party of three shared an order of fried calamari and shrimp platter.  The fried calamari was battered and fried to perfection.  The shrimp was fresh and flavorful.  Both appetizers were served with a delightful cocktail sauce and half a juicy lemon.  I liked the cocktail sauce very much because it was not overly horseradishy, just the right amount to give it a subtle kick.\n\nI don't know where it went wrong.  Maybe instead of the plain old ribeye steak, I should have ordered the bone in ribeye, but frankly, that's just too much meat for lil' old me.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but the Prime ribeye steak from Costco I cooked last week with some Montreal Steak Seasoning and Cajun spice last week tasted better that the ribeye steak from Bob's.  Bob's ribeye steak had good seasoning, but it was more of a medium than the medium rare I ordered.  I think that might've been what ruined it for me.  Whatever the reason, the ribeye was disappointing  For me, it was a mediocre steak not worth the $40 plus dollar price tag.", "rating": 3, "date": "2013-08-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Couple guys get salads (The Caesar looks good, but the beefsteak tomato with Red Onion is the winner), couple others get soup and the table shares a couple orders of the Shrimp Platter, Mushrooms, Onion Rings and Calamari.

There is a lot of talk about economics and especially the housing bubble and its bursting - we fancy ourselves experts and we take turns trying to outdo one another's analysis of the situation.  The drinks are well poured so we keep drinking.  After a couple drinks, someone always picks up the tab - at some point after a number of these evenings, you begin to get the sense that you have not gotten the drinks for some time and this time is probably your turn, when you get that feeling you buy.  Of course this is not policed in any way.\n\nAround 9 -9:30 we sit down at our table.  People around us get looks of concern on their faces when they see us walking towards them - this, obviously to them, can come to no good.  It doesn't help that one in our party is audibly slurring his words.  As he sits we give him some bread before he is allowed to order any more drinks.\n\nWe have another round of cocktails as we wait for our order.  All but one of us gets some form of red meat - the lone man out gets salmon.  WHAT?!?!?!?  He is the brunt of every joke for the rest of the evening.  His explanation, he had steak the night before???  Moron.  He will never do that again - the peer pressure is so great.  You may think I am kidding, I am not!\n\nCouple guys get salads (The Caesar looks good, but the beefsteak tomato with Red Onion is the winner), couple others get soup and the table shares a couple orders of the Shrimp Platter, Mushrooms, Onion Rings and Calamari.  Accepting the mushrooms, everything is very good.\n\nSeeing empty glasses, our waiter asks if anyone would like another cocktail (its probably 10:15 already).  There are a couple cocktail orders and the rest of us order wine which lasts through dinner.\n\nWhen everyone's food arrives the table gets quiet for a bit as it takes in the Baked potatoes, the Creamed Spinach, the broccoli and the Asparagus...  which are all good.  My favorites are the bakers (when I am in the carb mood) and the asparagus which is always excellent...  Ahhh, and the steaks (and of course the silly plate of salmon) - someone let him know what guys night out is all about.  The slight scent of pepper and freshly cooked steaks permeates the air around the table, mixing with the scents from around the large room to form a delicious redolence.  As the moment passes, conversation picks up again and we all start to eat, hardly aware of the pause at all.\n\nEverything is great.  The wine pours and the Zinfandel mixes well with the filet as to nearly bring a tear to my eye... nearly - I am with the guys and this salmon eating fool is the heel this night and I am certainly not taking that away from him. \n\nAfter dinner, of course, cognac for some, coffee for others.  Everyone is visibly relaxed and happy!\n\nBob's is very, very good.

Undecided of which steak I was going to order, i kept looking at their simple yet full of options menu. The waitress then mentioned that they also had in the restaurant a very special steak, Kobe steak. The meat is generally considered to be a delicacy, renowned for its flavor, and tenderness. So that's what I had. Let me put it this way, it's the best steak I have EVER had. So juicy, not overly seasoned. The steak had so much natural flavor. They actually just served it on a cutting board. Paired it with a delicious Cab, and I had the best steak dinner of my life. \nWe asked to complement the Chef and he came out. He said it's a real treat for him to prepare this kind of steak and took a lot of pride in it. His name is Santana Diaz, and he used to be Sacramento Kings Maloof brothers' personal chef. He gave me his card to call him to make sure he had Kobe steaks whenever we stopped by again. It was a pretty cool move.\nBy the way, the desert is also humongous.
