(I did take and post pix, but since it was so long ago, they didn't attach to this review.)\n\nLast year, a group of us were carpooling to Sonoma to get our wine on. Since I was the last in the pickup line, we decided to grab breakfast / brunch by my house. Our group of six didn't have a reservation anywhere, so we ended up at Eat Americana on Saturday, November 19th around 12:15pm. It was a rainy afternoon, so it wasn't too busy. They sat us right away at a table in the back.\n\n*2 Farm Eggs Breakfast: fried or scrambled, served with hash browns ($9), add Americana's Sausage (+$2), Avocado (+$2)\n*B.A.T. Scramble: 2 egg scramble of bacon, avocado, tomato, cheese & scallion, with house hash browns ($12)\n*Breakfast Burrito: 2 scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, hash browns, sausage, peppers & onions, salsa, sour cream ($12)\n*Buttermilk Pancakes: 2 pancakes with butter and maple syrup, 2 fried or scrambled eggs ($10)\n*Country Biscuit Plate: sausage gravy and 2 sunny-side eggs over toasted buttermilk biscuit ($10)\n*Americana Omelet: 3 eggs, cheddar cheese, bell pepper, onion, tomato, with house hash browns ($12), add Sausage (+$2)\n*Breakfast Pork Sausage Patty ($4) x2\n*Mimosa: prosecco, orange juice ($7) x4\n*Fresh Ground Coffee ($2)\n*Barq's Root Beer ($2) x2\n\nIf memory serves, I believe I got the americana omelette. I thought it was okay. Pretty standard and nothing special. I did enjoy starting the day with a mimosa and coffee though. I think they do bottomless, but I'm not sure if we got that as it was only $7 each. I tried the sausage patty which was good. Our server was very sweet. I drink a lot of liquids, so I constantly had to ask him for more water and coffee. I know that can be annoying since how much coffee and water can one person drink?! (The answer for me is A LOT.) But he never seemed irritated. Prices were good and everything was super affordable. I think we spent less than $25 each including tax and tip. They also give you small rice krispy treats with your bill.\n\nI used to love Americana Grill as they had a huge menu and my beloved Joe's Special. It was a HUGE portion and so good!

They don't seat too many people there--it's a smaller spot with average decor, so I dunno if there's ever a big waitlist or if they get swamped if they have a crowd.\n\nIt didn't change our lives in and of itself, but the app led us to an outside-of-their-routine spot that turned out to be a real winner.

It tasted as juicy as ever. I'm looking forward to coming back to enjoy their dinner menu. Many favorites from Ricky Bobby are also on the menu including new twists. I will be enjoying many meals here in the future. The owner and staff were also very attentive, friendly and accommodating.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-09-23"}, {"excerpts": ["My son had the bread pudding French toast, and 4 small squares, each about a mouthful, came out with a lot of whipped cream.

After being seated, they pretty much forgot about us; no tableware, napkins, water, anything.  15 minutes later, a waiter comes and asks us if we're ready to order.  I hate it when they ask that after making us wait a long time!  I mentioned that after the long wait, yes, we're ready to order.  The waiter looks at me like \"you have your nerve to complain!\".  I didn't take it further, as I didn't want him spitting in my food!\n\nI ordered decaf coffee with my meal, as I greatly reduced my caffeine intake.  He brought out a cup of hot water and a packet of decaf instant coffee.  I told him to just give me regular coffee instead and he insisted that I try the decaf.  After a couple of sips, I had him bring me the regular coffee.\n\nEventually, our food was brought out, but one order at a time with long pauses between each order.  My wife's order was last, and my son was almost finished with his before it came out.  For the price of each plate, I was a bit surprised that toast didn't come with the meal.  Also, serving sizes were pretty small for the price.  My son had the bread pudding French toast, and 4 small squares, each about a mouthful, came out with a lot of whipped cream.  We had 4 different dishes, and they were all okay, but not worth coming for.\n\nI know some people love this place, but we won't be coming back.

I learned that there was new ownership or a new chef, so I tried it again today. The service was sssssllllllllooooooowwwwww. It took forever just to get menus, then water, then to order, then to get our food. The food was OK. Nothing to gush about, but not bad. I got a breakfast burrito, and for $12 I expected a salad or some fruit or something else on the plate. But nope. It was a giant plate with a burrito cut in half on it, making it look very small. My 2-year-old had the grilled cheese with tomato soup, which was what it was. I was going to get a hot chocolate, but at $4, I'm glad I asked if it was real hot chocolate or from a powder packet. He said it was from a packet. This city has gotten out of control with pricing. $30 for a small lunch for 1 adult and 1 toddler is a little ridiculous.
