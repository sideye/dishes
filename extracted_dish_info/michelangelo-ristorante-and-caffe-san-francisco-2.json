The host here was standing outside and tempted us in with his promise that if we didn't love the food, he would pay for our meal. Too bad he didn't make the same offer for the service. We returned two months later for one of our worst dining experiences.\n\nI don't know if it's always this bad, but the service we received was the WORST I've ever experienced. We were seated right away (at a table awkwardly situated against a step-up near the corner), but that was all that went well. A basket of bread and bowl of olives were literally dumped on our table 15 minutes after we sat down, but it took 35 minutes before anyone came to take our order -- even for just drinks. My husband literally had to flag someone down. Three tables seated after us were served first. And the initial server who took our order then repeated it to our actual server.\n\nWe got our salads in about 15 minutes but those came 10 minutes before our drinks. In one of his fly-by passes of our table, the server said, \"Oh yeah, you wanted drinks\" and asked us to remind him what we ordered. Dinner took another half hour to arrive and the server failed to put the right plate in front of the right person. On another fly-by, he unceremoniously dumped a huge bowl of Parmesan cheese on our table and virtually ignored us the rest of the night.\n\nMaybe the service wouldn't have been so troublesome if the food at least had been good. It wasn't. I ordered the Pollo alla Milanese that has received rave reviews here. Apparently, the kitchen was asleep at the wheel tonight, too. There was absolutely no white wine, lemon sauce on my chicken. Some had sunk into the chicken, but not enough to keep it from tasting dried out. The mixed vegetables consisted of two flavorless pieces of broccoli and one half white potato sliced. My husband's lasagne didn't even fill three-quarters of the dish and was drowning in sauce. My daughter's spaghetti and meatballs were cold.\n\nOur server never asked once if we needed anything. I had to ask a second server to refill by daughter's water glass (her only drink) and bring us ketchup for my other daughter's fries. At one point, I tried to stop our server to ask for an additional glass of wine. \"OK, OK, OK,\" he said over his shoulder. We never got the wine. This dinner took 90 minutes start to finish -- with only salads and the entrees, no desserts or even second drinks. After waiting 15 minutes for the check, I finally walked up to our server and asked him to bring it to us so I could get my 4 year old home to bed. \"OK, OK, OK,\" he told me, again. Then he spent the next 5 minutes waiting on everyone else. I finally asked the hostess to please get it for us. Never once did the server even bother with a \"sorry it's so busy\" apology.\n\nI've never left a penny tip. Tonight, I did. This restaurant sends its host or hostess out to recruit diners -- even when it can't handle the customers it already has. I suggest they train their host or hostess to backup as a server. Clearly, that's needed. Because I can guarantee that even if the owner paid for my meal next time, I still wouldn't come back here.", "rating": 1, "date": "2015-08-10"}], "veal saltimbocca": [{"excerpts": ["The veal saltimbocca was small and had a funny flavor and the Veal Marsala tasted off too.
