The staff is very personable, real people and they're nice.  The menu is fairly extensive.  If you're only casually acquainted with Mediterranean cuisine, kebabs and hummus and such, you'll find lots of new things, and variants on what you know.\n\nBeing incredibly inexpensive is a big plus - it's priced only slightly above fast food: $8-11 for some of the main meals, $5 for desserts, $14 for a 6-salad appetizer plate for 2 (that could really be 4), each one better than the other.  And this is for sit down full service food at fine dining quality for taste and presentation.  Also, it's relatively healthy.  Things are a lot lighter than I'm used to.

Their pilav is pretty darn good, too. \n\nI would like their red cabbage on the salad to be a bit more like the pickled red cabbage that's served in Turkey.

"], "author": "Jim W.", "review": "There were no daily specials on the day we went to A La Turca, but the regular menu was exciting enough.  We started with cups of Turkish tea (which I enjoyed without adding the sugar cubes).  The combo platter under the \"cold appetizer\" section contained hummus, eggplant salad, piyaz (white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion), ezme (crushed roasted red and green bell pepper, tomato, onion, parsley), stuffed grape leaves, and cacik (yogurt with cucumber, mint, dill, and garlic).  The hummus was excellent: smooth, creamy, and the perfect accompaniment to the flatbread.  I'm not a fan of beans normally, but the rest of my party loved the bean salad.  The ezme looked like a salsa, but had a very subtle taste that also went well with the flatbread.  We also enjoyed the ispanakli borek from the \"hot appetizer\" section, which was a pastry dough, baked with feta cheese and spinach.  This was perhaps my favorite appetizer because the spinach with pastry is a perfect combination of textures and tastes.\n\nAmong our entrees, we had one disappointment.  We ordered a flatbread with mushroom and goat cheese, but modified it to have mozzarella and tomatoes as well.  Unfortunately, the resulting flatbread was bland and tasteless.  Adding tomatoes should not have resulted in such a boring dish -- perhaps a bit of feta would have punched it up a bit?\n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes as well, both of which were significantly better than the flatbread.  First, the adana kebab is skewered minced lamb flavored with special herbs and spices.  While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.  We also ordered the lamb sish kebab, which was more subtly spiced and thus had a more pungent lamb taste (which was appreciated by all).\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the baklava, which was too syrupy sweet, and the sutlac (rice pudding), which was delicately sweetened and had a wonderfully thick consistency.\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in the quality of the food here: the good dishes were great, while their interpretations of some dishes were lacking.

In the category of main dish, starting from Adana Kebap to Doner are all good, but my number one recommendation is Iskender (Alexander Kebap). You are served fine pieces of meat and bread with yogurt. Very good ! Once again, I will have to mention on some rare occasion, I have noticed the meat stripes are not thin enough.

Five of us ordered three appetizers, which were served with fresh warm seed bread (the waitress even came out to take away a basket of cold bread she had set down not a few minutes before, only to swap it out for a piping hot basket of soft, fresh bread that smelled great).  Drinks were served quickly after we ordered them and water refills were attentive and frequent, without having to ask for them.\n\nEntrees range from standard falafel to meat and/or veggie \"pies\" (more like pastries) with or without cheese, to meat served wrapped in lavash and smothered in spicy tomato sauce, to kebabs served in long thin slices of meat over bread, yogurt, and more spicy tomato sauce.  Everything was delicious and the desserts are good too - great baklava.

The bread that came with it, again moist and warm from being fresh out of the oven.

A La Turca piqued our interests because there aren't very many Turkish restaurants. Excited and eager, we all decided to go on a Friday night.\n\nI came with 3 other people on a Friday night at around 6 pm. The restaurant was rather empty to our pleasure so we quickly got seated.\n\nThe menu was large and vast so we had difficulty choosing what we wanted. Something that bothered me here was that our server came to ask us if we were ready way too many times within a short period. Normally I wouldn't be too irked by this, but considering the fact that the store was empty I didn't want to feel rushed.  However, when we wanted to pay for the bill and tried to grab the server's attention, it took much difficulty to do so.\n\nMy friends and I ended up ordering many dishes:\nWe got the Lahmacun(bread with delicious toppings on top), Combo Grilled Plate(Lamb/beef/chicken shishkabobs, and meat ball that comes with rice, salad, and pide bread), Lamb Beyti, Chicken & Mushroom Pide, Spinach & Cheese Gozleme, and Baklava.\n\nThe Lahmacun was very delicious. I thought this was one of their better dishes. It has a very unique flatbread texture with very seasoned toppings. The lahmacun had a great bite, and the taste was definitely there.\nThe Combo Grilled Plate was great. I thought the varying types of meat was fun. While they weren't unique, they were well cooked meats. The meats are very much different to shishkabob meats, but it was a good variety. \nThe Lamb Beyti was amazing. I really loved this dish. This dish was composed of ground lambed wrapped up into their flatbread. The dish comes with yogurt and their special sauce(which is a tomato based). I thought this dish had no flaws, and I could not find anything to be unhappy about.\nThe Spinach & Cheese Gozleme was disappointing. I expected the flour consistency to be as good as all their other breads but the gozleme was boring. It tasted like a quesadilla and because of that I was sorely disappointed.\nThe Baklava was generic baklava. It was less sticky than most baklava (which I liked) but the size was extremely small.\nLastly, while we ordered the Mushroom & chicken Pide, we got the Potato & Cheese Pide instead. We tried to tell our server this, but the server stubbornly said we ordered mushroom, and would not accept any conversation regarding it. This frustrated me because I would understand if we wouldn't be able to get the order fixed, but there was no attempt to talk about this at all. The potato and Cheese pide was disappointing as well, but that's because I believe the potato with the pide was a strange texture combination. While I really liked the pide, combining it with the potato made it a dish I find hard to recommend.\n\nOverall, in terms of the quality of food, A La Turca is a unique experience with many unique dishes, their Pide, Beyti, and Lahmacun especially.

Execution feels very home-style like you're at a Turkish relative's house if you have Turkish relatives. I don't so I actually don't know what I'm talking about, and it wouldn't be the first time. Anyway, we started with a couple of appetizers. First up was the $4.25 Lahmacun, two mini-turnovers that look like spanikopita only with ground lamb and green peppers, tomato, onion and spices (see photo). Tasty though it's hard to go wrong with filo dough. Next was marginally disappointing, the $4.95 Kiymali Borek, which I was hoping would be like the roadside Turkish lamb pizza you can get at bus stops along the Turquoise Coast (see photo).\n\nNo such luck - it was just pastry wedges, a little overcooked, with ground meat, onions and spices slathered on top. Entrees continued the lamb theme, as well as the hit-and-miss average. Mine was quite good and relatively straightforward, the $11.75 Lamb Shish Kebab Platter, which is strictly cubes of roasted leg of lamb, marinated with spices, and served with their house rice, a side salad and a yogurt sauce (see photo). Delicious and unadorned. Jamie ordered the $11.25 Beyti Kebap Platter, another lamb dish, ground but wrapped in lavash and served with a yogurt sauce (see photo). It was just a fancied-up shawarma and not a very satisfying one at that.\n\nWe did love the desserts. Jamie ordered the $4.25 serving of Baklava, very sweet but genuinely irresistible. I went with rest-home bland and loved it... the $4.95 Sutlac, a little crock of rice pudding heavy on the milk and baked in he oven to produce a nice hard topping. Our bottom-line verdict is that we liked it, didn't love it. I think they do a good job serving up the platters of authentic food, but I have to admit it wasn't all that distinctive in flavor as I think back on the meal. Oh well, let me go back to my whirling...\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...authentic, home-style Turkish fare, a bit hit-and-miss but great desserts\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...love the mural, pretty casual\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...efficient for sure, not that warm\nTOTAL  - 3 stars...I still love turkey...and Turkey", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-05-21"}, {"excerpts": ["They stayed open late so that we could pick up our order of lahmacun.

We started with cups of Turkish tea (which I enjoyed without adding the sugar cubes).  The combo platter under the \"cold appetizer\" section contained hummus, eggplant salad, piyaz (white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion), ezme (crushed roasted red and green bell pepper, tomato, onion, parsley), stuffed grape leaves, and cacik (yogurt with cucumber, mint, dill, and garlic).  The hummus was excellent: smooth, creamy, and the perfect accompaniment to the flatbread.  I'm not a fan of beans normally, but the rest of my party loved the bean salad.  The ezme looked like a salsa, but had a very subtle taste that also went well with the flatbread.  We also enjoyed the ispanakli borek from the \"hot appetizer\" section, which was a pastry dough, baked with feta cheese and spinach.  This was perhaps my favorite appetizer because the spinach with pastry is a perfect combination of textures and tastes.\n\nAmong our entrees, we had one disappointment.  We ordered a flatbread with mushroom and goat cheese, but modified it to have mozzarella and tomatoes as well.  Unfortunately, the resulting flatbread was bland and tasteless.  Adding tomatoes should not have resulted in such a boring dish -- perhaps a bit of feta would have punched it up a bit?\n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes as well, both of which were significantly better than the flatbread.  First, the adana kebab is skewered minced lamb flavored with special herbs and spices.  While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.  We also ordered the lamb sish kebab, which was more subtly spiced and thus had a more pungent lamb taste (which was appreciated by all).\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the baklava, which was too syrupy sweet, and the sutlac (rice pudding), which was delicately sweetened and had a wonderfully thick consistency.\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in the quality of the food here: the good dishes were great, while their interpretations of some dishes were lacking.

I liked it enough to come here a handful of times especially when two can leave stuffed for less than $30. \n\nMr. NSS never had Turkish food before and not wanting him to blow a gasket over the dinner bill, I thought A La Turca would be a good place to bring him. \n\nA La Turca is just as I remembered it, cobble stone entry way, an open kitchen with vertical spits, earthy toned d\u00e9cor, and a somewhat cozy dining room. \n\nWe started with the Kiymali Borek ($4.95) which is like a Turkish empanada filled with ground beef, onion and spices. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2PRgMkqX2dRrcuaJEi_1Rg?select=vkynJm-9v8XlNWnZZGJCxg#I_7wQteuJoh0I5v1tWpRJg Mediocre at best, the beef filling was both scant and dry. The dry pastry shell lacked a delicate flakiness. One of my favorite Turkish dishes is the Lamb Beyti ($11.25) which is ground lamb wrapped in lavash and then topped with garlic yogurt. Not here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2PRgMkqX2dRrcuaJEi_1Rg?select=vkynJm-9v8XlNWnZZGJCxg#glfQSYWyOsojumIMdogbtw Like a horrific aftermath of a gangbang (sorry, I just had to), the beyti was severely over-sauced with yogurt sauce making the lavash incredibly wet and soggy on the bottom. The Combo Grill Meat Platter ($13.50) \"used to\" be my go-to dish at A La Turca. Keywords: \"used to\". http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2PRgMkqX2dRrcuaJEi_1Rg?select=vkynJm-9v8XlNWnZZGJCxg#4EzU1IzD3oOaGn27J4GW_A The lamb sish (lamb cubes), kofte (lamb & beef patty), doner (shaved ground lamb and beef) & beef sish (beef cubes) were all very well-seasoned and flavorful, BUT they were ALL overcooked and dry. The doner was the worst of the quad and had the texture of shoe leather. \n\nService is pleasant as you would expect from a family-owned restaurant. We were one of three customers on a Monday night so the food came out fairly quickly but the times I've visited when it was busy, food service was very slow. \n\nIf you need a Turkish fix, go to Troya in Inner Richmond (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/troya-san-francisco#hrid:z2rd1mAYwRonuYfJdLRfHQ) and NOT the one in Pac Heights (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/troya-fillmore-san-francisco#hrid:XROisJ5mSrOCzn5QfBPMvg). \n\nMr. NSS: \"You must have come to A La Turca before you became expensive.\" \n\nMe: \"Excuse me... what did YOU just call me?!?!\"\n\n*Cricket Cricket*", "rating": 3, "date": "2012-08-16"}, {"excerpts": ["Also ordered an appetizer of Kiymali Borek: Pastry dough baked with sauteed ground meat.

The sliced mushrooms seemed to be the canned variety.  It was like a flavorless quesadilla.  They should add some herbs.  Very disappointing.  \n\n* Kavurmali & Cheese Pides ($8.50):  This was like a calzone - a soft, thick doughy baked turnover filled with melted cheese, lamb cubes, red pepper and onions - rather tasty \n\nWe also had a borek which is another savory pie but with a thin, buttery, flaky baked shell.  Each rectangular borek is quite small and flat.  We received 2 for $4.95.  It was fine, nothing too special.\n\n* Combo grill meat platter ($13.50) with lamb shis, kofte, doner and beef shis, fluffy rice, green salad and yogurt.  I wasn't too impressed with any of the meat.  The flavor was just okay and some pieces were dry.\n\nI think the complimentary bread was the best part of the meal, followed by the pides.  Every dish came with a side salad, which seemed odd.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively and casual and the restaurant is smack dab in middle of the Tenderloin.

I know it's not the establishment's fault, but they could have said something and asked the parents to keep their kids quieter. I guess this is just indicative of the crowd that normally goes there? Shortly afterwards there were maybe 4 or 5 kids left and some adults. None of them were actually at a table and the kids were crowded up against me and my party. They were loud, rude, SITTING ON MY COAT that I had put down next to me on the bench, and actually were staring at us! Kind of like the workers, but more blatantly.

We ordered a flatbread with mushroom and goat cheese, but modified it to have mozzarella and tomatoes as well.  Unfortunately, the resulting flatbread was bland and tasteless.  Adding tomatoes should not have resulted in such a boring dish -- perhaps a bit of feta would have punched it up a bit?\n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes as well, both of which were significantly better than the flatbread.  First, the adana kebab is skewered minced lamb flavored with special herbs and spices.  While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.  We also ordered the lamb sish kebab, which was more subtly spiced and thus had a more pungent lamb taste (which was appreciated by all).\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the baklava, which was too syrupy sweet, and the sutlac (rice pudding), which was delicately sweetened and had a wonderfully thick consistency.\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in the quality of the food here: the good dishes were great, while their interpretations of some dishes were lacking.

Fluffy white rice, flavorful in that wonderfully buttery way that rice can be. Beautifully seasoned and grilled cubes of chicken breast, along with a side of yogurt sauce that again complemented the chicken. And a light salad of lettuce and red cabbage that added some crunch and refreshment to the dish.\n \nThe only complaint I have is that our waiter did not take a drink order for us. We had to ask for water from another server. He made up for it, however, by bringing us complimentary glasses of tea with sugar lumps on the side, as we were finishing our meal.\n \nAgain for dessert, we decided to share. I ordered the sutlac, a rich and creamy baked rice pudding that was topped with crushed pistachios. Not too sweet, and absolutely delightful.

I would stick to the hummus, soup, and eggplant, and leave the bread for someone else.\n\nAs soon as I arrived in the office I tried some of the soup. It was sadly a disappointment. It was watery and lacked flavor. I moved onto the hummus. It was fantastic with great flavor. The grilled eggplant was also quite good - but very oily and rich and I had trouble stomaching it. I stuck to the hummus and dipped carrots hungrily into it.\n\nBut that bread...\n\nThat bread still called to me. I made a deal with myself to just try a little of it. I broke it off. It was thick and doughy and still warm. Divine. I took a bite of it. It was incredible. Topped lightly with sesame seeds and bursting with softness. I couldn't help myself. I ate both servings of it with fervor. And then sat back down in my office chair looking at the crumbs around me.\n\nA La Turca isn't exactly going to be doing your waistline any favors. Most of their non-meat dishes are full of cheese and bread. But if you're OK with that - then by all means come here and go big. All of their pies are baked fresh on premises - as is their bread. I can't recommend their lentil soup - but everything else is worth a try.\n\nTrust.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-12-29"}, {"excerpts": ["While the bread was not piping hot, I enjoyed most of the meze offerings particularly the eggplant salad, hummus, and cacik.

I ordered a meze sampler which was probably the best thing I ate. While the bread was not piping hot, I enjoyed most of the meze offerings particularly the eggplant salad, hummus, and cacik. I ordered the lentil soup which was too thick and lacking in seasoning. Additionally, the texture was gritting and not smooth as I have had at other restaurants. My entree was Iskender kebap. The bread cubes should have been buttery and fresh. Instead they were cut too small, burnt and not very buttery. The doner meat was lacking seasoning as was the tomato sauce on top. The best thing on the plate was the yogurt.\n\nWhile it was not my favorite meal, it was also not the worst thing I have ever eaten. It was edible but just completely underwhelming.

Well, now the donor is around 14.75 and the appetizers are 5.75.  Prices are still within reason but if they raise their prices one more time we might have to find another Turkish restaurant.

The meat was good but I noticed I didn't get any chicken, only red meat. \n\nI didn't care about that though as I was hungry and liked what I got anyways. My husband had no complaints. His falafel wrap was huge. There is a parking structure right next to this place if none on the street is available.

Of course, a European trip would be better, but we had to put off our annual trip to Europe for now because of the recession.  The business that he owns has slowed down since the recession got worse.

While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.

I went for one of the cheaper options, Salmon Creek Pinot Grigio, which was just fine and worked with the dishes we enjoyed. For appetizers, we had Eggplant Salad, Piyaz, Ezme and Hummus. The Eggplant Salad is nicely baked eggplant with red and green pepper, onion, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil. The vegetables work nicely together and the lemon juice lightens the dish a bit. Piyaz is white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion, lemon juice and olive oil all tossed together. It's tasty and the generous amount of beans makes it fairly hearty as well. The Ezme, crushed and roasted red bell pepper with tomato and onion and spices, is served on grilled pita bread and it works as a simple starter. The Hummus was quite tasty as well, though not as thick as I usually like. The appetizers are all under $5 a pop so it's not a bad idea to sample a bit. We also shared various platters for our entrees. The Doner, or beef sirloin and lamb spiced and roasted and thinly sliced, was tasty and the meat was nice and tender. There's also a Chicken Doner with the same preparation and presentation. We also had a few of the Kebab options which all had the same spice but all were nicely prepared and the meat wasn't overdone. We couldn't resist the Sucuk and Cheese pide, which was really tasty. Not sure about the Chicken and Pineapple combo on a pide, but I'd be curious to try it if I go back. There also are a few soups and salads and a short kid's menu. Alaturca is a cute and laid-back spot that's great for a casual meal, and definitely works for big groups.

A La Turca piqued our interests because there aren't very many Turkish restaurants. Excited and eager, we all decided to go on a Friday night.\n\nI came with 3 other people on a Friday night at around 6 pm. The restaurant was rather empty to our pleasure so we quickly got seated.\n\nThe menu was large and vast so we had difficulty choosing what we wanted. Something that bothered me here was that our server came to ask us if we were ready way too many times within a short period. Normally I wouldn't be too irked by this, but considering the fact that the store was empty I didn't want to feel rushed.  However, when we wanted to pay for the bill and tried to grab the server's attention, it took much difficulty to do so.\n\nMy friends and I ended up ordering many dishes:\nWe got the Lahmacun(bread with delicious toppings on top), Combo Grilled Plate(Lamb/beef/chicken shishkabobs, and meat ball that comes with rice, salad, and pide bread), Lamb Beyti, Chicken & Mushroom Pide, Spinach & Cheese Gozleme, and Baklava.\n\nThe Lahmacun was very delicious. I thought this was one of their better dishes. It has a very unique flatbread texture with very seasoned toppings. The lahmacun had a great bite, and the taste was definitely there.\nThe Combo Grilled Plate was great. I thought the varying types of meat was fun. While they weren't unique, they were well cooked meats. The meats are very much different to shishkabob meats, but it was a good variety. \nThe Lamb Beyti was amazing. I really loved this dish. This dish was composed of ground lambed wrapped up into their flatbread. The dish comes with yogurt and their special sauce(which is a tomato based). I thought this dish had no flaws, and I could not find anything to be unhappy about.\nThe Spinach & Cheese Gozleme was disappointing. I expected the flour consistency to be as good as all their other breads but the gozleme was boring. It tasted like a quesadilla and because of that I was sorely disappointed.\nThe Baklava was generic baklava. It was less sticky than most baklava (which I liked) but the size was extremely small.\nLastly, while we ordered the Mushroom & chicken Pide, we got the Potato & Cheese Pide instead. We tried to tell our server this, but the server stubbornly said we ordered mushroom, and would not accept any conversation regarding it. This frustrated me because I would understand if we wouldn't be able to get the order fixed, but there was no attempt to talk about this at all. The potato and Cheese pide was disappointing as well, but that's because I believe the potato with the pide was a strange texture combination. While I really liked the pide, combining it with the potato made it a dish I find hard to recommend.\n\nOverall, in terms of the quality of food, A La Turca is a unique experience with many unique dishes, their Pide, Beyti, and Lahmacun especially. However, A La Turca is a rather pricey place, and while there are some gems, there are a lot of generic dishes as well.

Hungry for something from the generally middle east / central Asia geographical area, we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  Seeing it was about 95 degrees inside and 75 outside on the sidewalk (albeit with three patrons smoking right by the entrance and the prospect of of visits from from the street people around there) we opted for the outside option.  We let the manager know we were outside and they told us they'd send someone out.  The waitress nodded.  About 15 minutes later without seeing any staff, I walked in and grabbed a menu myself.  After another 15 waitressless minutes, I walked in and ordered directly from the chef who seemed sympathetic.   \"10 minutes\" he said.  We knew from the Yelp highlights that the chicken beyti was popular as were the \"pides\" though there were like ten choices of those.  So we asked for a recommendation and the counter person said \"You like meat? then definitely get sujuk and cheese.\"  Another 15-20 minutes later the food came out.  So until this point they're rockin about 0.5 stars.  But then, the PIDE, THAT SUJUK AND CHEESE PIDE. HFS it was money.  Rich, fresh, hot, toasty, just a bit of spice, just enough cheese to balance the bread.  Perfect.  \n\nYes, the chicken beyti looked cool with the colorful sauces on it, but that was pretty much it: a hottie with nothing inside worth dealing with.\n\nAnyway, we got out of there pretty soon after.  Going by previous experience, we didn't wait for the check, just walked up to the register to pay it. Maybe they just had a rough staffing day, who knows. The three visits we enjoyed from street people (including one pretty rough flower vendor) definitely added some variety to the meal, but it's not for everyone.

The short wine list has some interesting choices from California, Italy and of course Turkey. I went for one of the cheaper options, Salmon Creek Pinot Grigio, which was just fine and worked with the dishes we enjoyed. For appetizers, we had Eggplant Salad, Piyaz, Ezme and Hummus. The Eggplant Salad is nicely baked eggplant with red and green pepper, onion, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil. The vegetables work nicely together and the lemon juice lightens the dish a bit. Piyaz is white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion, lemon juice and olive oil all tossed together. It's tasty and the generous amount of beans makes it fairly hearty as well. The Ezme, crushed and roasted red bell pepper with tomato and onion and spices, is served on grilled pita bread and it works as a simple starter. The Hummus was quite tasty as well, though not as thick as I usually like. The appetizers are all under $5 a pop so it's not a bad idea to sample a bit.

And since we've been affected by the recession like most people, this was a good place to go. If we had more money to spend on food and not have to worry about paying the mortgage on our house and other bills, we would go to more expensive places. \n\nToday my husband surprised me by asking me if I'd like to go on a cruise to Hawaii in the fall or winter. I think this might be my Christmas gift this year-:) I sure hope so. That would be great. Of course, a European trip would be better, but we had to put off our annual trip to Europe for now because of the recession.  The business that he owns has slowed down since the recession got worse. Hawaii is great though. I've been there before and loved it! It is as beautiful as it is on TV and books.

Roughly speaking it's fairly similar to Greek food but with more heat and spice. The space is comfortable and the high ceilings make it seem larger than it is. There's not much decor but the vibe is still pleasant and welcoming. We were a large group on a Friday evening and we had the entire semi-private upstairs area to ourselves which was really nice. The short wine list has some interesting choices from California, Italy and of course Turkey. I went for one of the cheaper options, Salmon Creek Pinot Grigio, which was just fine and worked with the dishes we enjoyed. For appetizers, we had Eggplant Salad, Piyaz, Ezme and Hummus. The Eggplant Salad is nicely baked eggplant with red and green pepper, onion, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil. The vegetables work nicely together and the lemon juice lightens the dish a bit. Piyaz is white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion, lemon juice and olive oil all tossed together. It's tasty and the generous amount of beans makes it fairly hearty as well. The Ezme, crushed and roasted red bell pepper with tomato and onion and spices, is served on grilled pita bread and it works as a simple starter. The Hummus was quite tasty as well, though not as thick as I usually like. The appetizers are all under $5 a pop so it's not a bad idea to sample a bit. We also shared various platters for our entrees. The Doner, or beef sirloin and lamb spiced and roasted and thinly sliced, was tasty and the meat was nice and tender. There's also a Chicken Doner with the same preparation and presentation. We also had a few of the Kebab options which all had the same spice but all were nicely prepared and the meat wasn't overdone.

I like the bread cubes to be more crispy, these were very soft and with the added meat and sauce on top they had no structural integrity by the time the dish reached the table.

Mine was quite good and relatively straightforward, the $11.75 Lamb Shish Kebab Platter, which is strictly cubes of roasted leg of lamb, marinated with spices, and served with their house rice, a side salad and a yogurt sauce (see photo). Delicious and unadorned. Jamie ordered the $11.25 Beyti Kebap Platter, another lamb dish, ground but wrapped in lavash and served with a yogurt sauce (see photo).

A La Turca piqued our interests because there aren't very many Turkish restaurants. Excited and eager, we all decided to go on a Friday night.\n\nI came with 3 other people on a Friday night at around 6 pm. The restaurant was rather empty to our pleasure so we quickly got seated.\n\nThe menu was large and vast so we had difficulty choosing what we wanted. Something that bothered me here was that our server came to ask us if we were ready way too many times within a short period. Normally I wouldn't be too irked by this, but considering the fact that the store was empty I didn't want to feel rushed.  However, when we wanted to pay for the bill and tried to grab the server's attention, it took much difficulty to do so.\n\nMy friends and I ended up ordering many dishes:\nWe got the Lahmacun(bread with delicious toppings on top), Combo Grilled Plate(Lamb/beef/chicken shishkabobs, and meat ball that comes with rice, salad, and pide bread), Lamb Beyti, Chicken & Mushroom Pide, Spinach & Cheese Gozleme, and Baklava.\n\nThe Lahmacun was very delicious. I thought this was one of their better dishes. It has a very unique flatbread texture with very seasoned toppings. The lahmacun had a great bite, and the taste was definitely there.\nThe Combo Grilled Plate was great. I thought the varying types of meat was fun. While they weren't unique, they were well cooked meats. The meats are very much different to shishkabob meats, but it was a good variety. \nThe Lamb Beyti was amazing. I really loved this dish. This dish was composed of ground lambed wrapped up into their flatbread. The dish comes with yogurt and their special sauce(which is a tomato based). I thought this dish had no flaws, and I could not find anything to be unhappy about.\nThe Spinach & Cheese Gozleme was disappointing. I expected the flour consistency to be as good as all their other breads but the gozleme was boring. It tasted like a quesadilla and because of that I was sorely disappointed.\nThe Baklava was generic baklava. It was less sticky than most baklava (which I liked) but the size was extremely small.\nLastly, while we ordered the Mushroom & chicken Pide, we got the Potato & Cheese Pide instead. We tried to tell our server this, but the server stubbornly said we ordered mushroom, and would not accept any conversation regarding it. This frustrated me because I would understand if we wouldn't be able to get the order fixed, but there was no attempt to talk about this at all. The potato and Cheese pide was disappointing as well, but that's because I believe the potato with the pide was a strange texture combination. While I really liked the pide, combining it with the potato made it a dish I find hard to recommend.\n\nOverall, in terms of the quality of food, A La Turca is a unique experience with many unique dishes, their Pide, Beyti, and Lahmacun especially. However, A La Turca is a rather pricey place, and while there are some gems, there are a lot of generic dishes as well.

I've been wanting to come here for ages, so I finally convinced Jamie W. to take the overpacked 38 Geary to the heart of the Tenderloin to give this family-run place a try. It looks like what you'd expect... kinda like a big luncheonette deli with a big animated mural of Turkey on the long side wall.\n\nMenu items are quite traditional at least from my recollections of Istanbul restaurants. Execution feels very home-style like you're at a Turkish relative's house if you have Turkish relatives. I don't so I actually don't know what I'm talking about, and it wouldn't be the first time. Anyway, we started with a couple of appetizers. First up was the $4.25 Lahmacun, two mini-turnovers that look like spanikopita only with ground lamb and green peppers, tomato, onion and spices (see photo). Tasty though it's hard to go wrong with filo dough. Next was marginally disappointing, the $4.95 Kiymali Borek, which I was hoping would be like the roadside Turkish lamb pizza you can get at bus stops along the Turquoise Coast (see photo).\n\nNo such luck - it was just pastry wedges, a little overcooked, with ground meat, onions and spices slathered on top. Entrees continued the lamb theme, as well as the hit-and-miss average. Mine was quite good and relatively straightforward, the $11.75 Lamb Shish Kebab Platter, which is strictly cubes of roasted leg of lamb, marinated with spices, and served with their house rice, a side salad and a yogurt sauce (see photo). Delicious and unadorned. Jamie ordered the $11.25 Beyti Kebap Platter, another lamb dish, ground but wrapped in lavash and served with a yogurt sauce (see photo). It was just a fancied-up shawarma and not a very satisfying one at that.\n\nWe did love the desserts. Jamie ordered the $4.25 serving of Baklava, very sweet but genuinely irresistible. I went with rest-home bland and loved it... the $4.95 Sutlac, a little crock of rice pudding heavy on the milk and baked in he oven to produce a nice hard topping.

We started with cups of Turkish tea (which I enjoyed without adding the sugar cubes).  The combo platter under the \"cold appetizer\" section contained hummus, eggplant salad, piyaz (white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion), ezme (crushed roasted red and green bell pepper, tomato, onion, parsley), stuffed grape leaves, and cacik (yogurt with cucumber, mint, dill, and garlic).  The hummus was excellent: smooth, creamy, and the perfect accompaniment to the flatbread.  I'm not a fan of beans normally, but the rest of my party loved the bean salad.  The ezme looked like a salsa, but had a very subtle taste that also went well with the flatbread.  We also enjoyed the ispanakli borek from the \"hot appetizer\" section, which was a pastry dough, baked with feta cheese and spinach.  This was perhaps my favorite appetizer because the spinach with pastry is a perfect combination of textures and tastes.\n\nAmong our entrees, we had one disappointment.  We ordered a flatbread with mushroom and goat cheese, but modified it to have mozzarella and tomatoes as well.  Unfortunately, the resulting flatbread was bland and tasteless.  Adding tomatoes should not have resulted in such a boring dish -- perhaps a bit of feta would have punched it up a bit?\n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes as well, both of which were significantly better than the flatbread.  First, the adana kebab is skewered minced lamb flavored with special herbs and spices.  While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.  We also ordered the lamb sish kebab, which was more subtly spiced and thus had a more pungent lamb taste (which was appreciated by all).\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the baklava, which was too syrupy sweet, and the sutlac (rice pudding), which was delicately sweetened and had a wonderfully thick consistency.\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in the quality of the food here: the good dishes were great, while their interpretations of some dishes were lacking.

Turkish style Pizza, known as Lahmacun is very good too, although some days it lacks consistency and can become more soggy than crispy. But in general it is great with lettuce, onion  on top and lemon sprinkled. In the category of main dish, starting from Adana Kebap to Doner are all good, but my number one recommendation is Iskender (Alexander Kebap). You are served fine pieces of meat and bread with yogurt. Very good ! Once again, I will have to mention on some rare occasion, I have noticed the meat stripes are not thin enough. May be I can catch these inconsistencies being an avid supporter of  Iskender  for  the past 3 years or may be its time for me to try it in Istanbul once!

I've been wanting to come here for ages, so I finally convinced Jamie W. to take the overpacked 38 Geary to the heart of the Tenderloin to give this family-run place a try. It looks like what you'd expect... kinda like a big luncheonette deli with a big animated mural of Turkey on the long side wall.\n\nMenu items are quite traditional at least from my recollections of Istanbul restaurants. Execution feels very home-style like you're at a Turkish relative's house if you have Turkish relatives. I don't so I actually don't know what I'm talking about, and it wouldn't be the first time.

First up was the $4.25 Lahmacun, two mini-turnovers that look like spanikopita only with ground lamb and green peppers, tomato, onion and spices (see photo). Tasty though it's hard to go wrong with filo dough. Next was marginally disappointing, the $4.95 Kiymali Borek, which I was hoping would be like the roadside Turkish lamb pizza you can get at bus stops along the Turquoise Coast (see photo).\n\nNo such luck - it was just pastry wedges, a little overcooked, with ground meat, onions and spices slathered on top. Entrees continued the lamb theme, as well as the hit-and-miss average. Mine was quite good and relatively straightforward, the $11.75 Lamb Shish Kebab Platter, which is strictly cubes of roasted leg of lamb, marinated with spices, and served with their house rice, a side salad and a yogurt sauce (see photo). Delicious and unadorned. Jamie ordered the $11.25 Beyti Kebap Platter, another lamb dish, ground but wrapped in lavash and served with a yogurt sauce (see photo).

We were looking for a reasonably priced place to eat dinner beforehand, and although A La Turca's online menu does not have prices, we decided to give it a try.\n \nBoy, were we not disappointed! We arrived just at 6 PM, as on street parking becomes available. The place was nearly empty at that time, although it had filled up almost completely by the time we finished our meal.\n \nThe waiter who greeted us was friendly, and spent quite a bit of time chatting with us about his favorite dishes, and helping us decide what to order.\n \nWe ended up deciding to share a few items. Our meal began with the dolmas - stuffed grape leaves. They were tender and lemony, with just the right amount of seasoning. We also received a basket of pide - fluffy bread with just a light sprinkle of sesame and black nigella seeds for interest.\n \nWhen our entrees arrived, we decided to eat half from the plate in front of us, and switch. I thought my friend was going to change her mind, after taking a bite of her chicken Iskender. Unbelievably tender chicken from a spit, in a lovely spiced tomato and yogurt sauce, on top of cubes of pide, which soaked up the sauce and became delightfully soft and chewy. The Iskender was served with cacik, a yogurt sauce that complemented it perfectly.\n \nMy own dish was the chicken shish kebap, and I was not disappointed either. Fluffy white rice, flavorful in that wonderfully buttery way that rice can be. Beautifully seasoned and grilled cubes of chicken breast, along with a side of yogurt sauce that again complemented the chicken. And a light salad of lettuce and red cabbage that added some crunch and refreshment to the dish.\n \nThe only complaint I have is that our waiter did not take a drink order for us. We had to ask for water from another server. He made up for it, however, by bringing us complimentary glasses of tea with sugar lumps on the side, as we were finishing our meal.\n \nAgain for dessert, we decided to share. I ordered the sutlac, a rich and creamy baked rice pudding that was topped with crushed pistachios. Not too sweet, and absolutely delightful.

We started with cups of Turkish tea (which I enjoyed without adding the sugar cubes).  The combo platter under the \"cold appetizer\" section contained hummus, eggplant salad, piyaz (white beans, parsley, red and green pepper, onion), ezme (crushed roasted red and green bell pepper, tomato, onion, parsley), stuffed grape leaves, and cacik (yogurt with cucumber, mint, dill, and garlic).  The hummus was excellent: smooth, creamy, and the perfect accompaniment to the flatbread.  I'm not a fan of beans normally, but the rest of my party loved the bean salad.  The ezme looked like a salsa, but had a very subtle taste that also went well with the flatbread.  We also enjoyed the ispanakli borek from the \"hot appetizer\" section, which was a pastry dough, baked with feta cheese and spinach.  This was perhaps my favorite appetizer because the spinach with pastry is a perfect combination of textures and tastes.\n\nAmong our entrees, we had one disappointment.  We ordered a flatbread with mushroom and goat cheese, but modified it to have mozzarella and tomatoes as well.  Unfortunately, the resulting flatbread was bland and tasteless.  Adding tomatoes should not have resulted in such a boring dish -- perhaps a bit of feta would have punched it up a bit?\n\nWe ordered two lamb dishes as well, both of which were significantly better than the flatbread.  First, the adana kebab is skewered minced lamb flavored with special herbs and spices.  While the minced meat itself was definitely flavorful, the taste of the herbes/spices overpowered the lamb itself.  The highlight was the rice, which went perfectly with the intense adana kebab.  We also ordered the lamb sish kebab, which was more subtly spiced and thus had a more pungent lamb taste (which was appreciated by all).\n\nFor dessert, we ended with the baklava, which was too syrupy sweet, and the sutlac (rice pudding), which was delicately sweetened and had a wonderfully thick consistency.\n\nThere were some inconsistencies in the quality of the food here: the good dishes were great, while their interpretations of some dishes were lacking.

It's like,  pieces of chicken wrapped in their lavash bread topped with a well spiced tomato sauce and yogurt. It's very good and everyone at our table thought so.  A pide, according to waitress, is like a calzone, but Turkish of course. This was also not bad, and as I'm more of a potato person, I enjoyed the potato &cheese over the spinach one. Nice and piping hot. Chicken and cheese gozleme, well I suppose it really was like a Turkish quesadilla as said by Patrick M, but not so much cheese in it.

Very good, although the best Turkish in or near SF for me is still Mivan in Burlingame. We started out with Hummus and Cacik as well as a lahmacun and ispanakli borek. They were all tasty, and the lahmacun was particularly good, The crust was appropriately thin and crispy and the meat mixture was nicely spiced.  I had an Iskander kebap, one of my favorite dishes at Mivan, for comparison. A la Turca's version was tasty, but it lacked in a couple of ways. I like the bread cubes to be more crispy, these were very soft and with the added meat and sauce on top they had no structural integrity by the time the dish reached the table. At Mivan they're more like croutons and it's a nice contrast to the tenderness of the meat and the zingy sauce. The sauce at alaturca was very good and there was a lot of it, they were also very generous with the yogurt. One of my dining companions got the Chicken Doner and it was quite tasty. Another got the Beyti Kebap, also good, although I wasn't wowed by it. The final diner got a Falafel sandwich which was very good. Really flavorful tender falafel on excellent homemade pita.

The Sucuk and cheese one is also really yummy. \nI've tried many of their platters, but my favorite by far is the Adana Kebab. The lamb is well seasoned and really tasty. Even the rice pilaf and salad that come with it are good. \nFinally the desert I've been dreaming about since the first bite. Kunefe. You really gotta try that. Even though Im always full at the end of the dinner, I can't never leave without having my Kunefe.

I had an Iskander kebap, one of my favorite dishes at Mivan, for comparison. A la Turca's version was tasty, but it lacked in a couple of ways. I like the bread cubes to be more crispy, these were very soft and with the added meat and sauce on top they had no structural integrity by the time the dish reached the table. At Mivan they're more like croutons and it's a nice contrast to the tenderness of the meat and the zingy sauce. The sauce at alaturca was very good and there was a lot of it, they were also very generous with the yogurt. One of my dining companions got the Chicken Doner and it was quite tasty.

We also received a basket of pide - fluffy bread with just a light sprinkle of sesame and black nigella seeds for interest.\n \nWhen our entrees arrived, we decided to eat half from the plate in front of us, and switch. I thought my friend was going to change her mind, after taking a bite of her chicken Iskender. Unbelievably tender chicken from a spit, in a lovely spiced tomato and yogurt sauce, on top of cubes of pide, which soaked up the sauce and became delightfully soft and chewy. The Iskender was served with cacik, a yogurt sauce that complemented it perfectly.\n \nMy own dish was the chicken shish kebap, and I was not disappointed either. Fluffy white rice, flavorful in that wonderfully buttery way that rice can be. Beautifully seasoned and grilled cubes of chicken breast, along with a side of yogurt sauce that again complemented the chicken. And a light salad of lettuce and red cabbage that added some crunch and refreshment to the dish.\n \nThe only complaint I have is that our waiter did not take a drink order for us. We had to ask for water from another server. He made up for it, however, by bringing us complimentary glasses of tea with sugar lumps on the side, as we were finishing our meal.\n \nAgain for dessert, we decided to share. I ordered the sutlac, a rich and creamy baked rice pudding that was topped with crushed pistachios. Not too sweet, and absolutely delightful. My friend ordered the burma , a pinwheel of phyllo dough with honey and pistachios that was absolutely out of this world.\n \nA La Turca is definitely worth a try - it's even worth a drive into the city from wherever you reside. I'll definitely be returning.\"", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-02-01"}]}
