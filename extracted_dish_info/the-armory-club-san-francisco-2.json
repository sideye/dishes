There's tons of alternative portraits inside so the faint of heart should just keep moving along. Also anyone easily offended should also not go inside. It's a very cozy space and the main bar has plenty of seating. There is also a fireplace which would be great for the colder nights. There is also a second bar down the hallway. There were only a few people in there at the time.\n\nThe bartenders make great drinks. It's a work of art watching them artfully create your drink. I highly recommend the Peace Pipe as it contains a spicy concoction of Mezcal and jalapenos. Spicaaaaay. \n\nSomebody broke the lock for the unisex bathroom.

The bar wasn't very busy.  The back room was being reserved for a party, so we ordered at the bar and sat along in the main room along a window.\n\nThe bar was well stocked with all types of liquor (although I just looked at the bourbons and ryes for the most part) and the cocktail menu had a great mix of house concoctions.\n\nOur party of four basically worked our way through the entire cocktail menu and all were fantastic.  I got stuck on the Smokescreen (rye, scotch, amaro, bitters) because it had the kick I like in a drink.  Sipped on the others and had no complaints.\n\nThe bartenders were awesome.  Remembering drinks, the tab, friendly, etc.\n\nWe left around 10:30 or 11 and it still wasn't jammed.\n\nDuring our visit we went to a lot of establishments in SF, and without a doubt The Armory Club won the gold medal.

I loved the wallpaper - an intricate repeating pattern of peacock feathers, and the ceiling - molded tin with a bronze hue. There are beautifully painted bondage scenes on the walls as well, all hung on ornate gilded frames. There's lots of seating between the leather topped barstools along the bar and windows and the lush leather armchairs and couches gathered around the fake fireplace. \n\nWe sat on those barstools by the windows and there was a bar top there where we could put down our drinks. I loved that the edges of the wood that made up this bar top wasn't cut at straight, ninety degree angles but kept the original curvature and breaks in the wood. It gave it a very natural yet classy vibe. \n\nI'm always intrigued by the framed flatscreen TVs that show a live feed of the production rooms in the kink.com Armory across the intersection - of course I'll always be there after work hours, so will i ever get to see them filming anything?\n\nThey have *three* full pages of signature cocktails. This allowed my friends and I to each get something completely different that's conducive to our tastes. When we got our round and all took a sip, every one of us immediately said, \"I love my drink.\" Of course, when we swapped and tried each other's it was a different story. But that's the beauty in the diversity of cocktail-making.\n\n* Black Beard Punch - 4 stars\n(Mount gay black marker, guava, passion, pineapple, Elizabeth all spice dram, kraken, rocks. $9)\nMy drink, and I love a good refreshingly sweet cocktail. It's like an amazing guava juice, and you can even taste the texture of the fruit in there - I love that part. As I progressed through the drink, I could taste the rum more and more - but it's good rum and blends smoothly into these fruit flavors. Of course, a friend who likes his strong Bourbons hated this but it was the perfect drink for me. \n\n* Gently Bound - 4 stars\n(City of london dry gin, creme yvette, rhubarb bitters, lemon, sparkling wine. $9)\nA carbonated drink that the rest of us really disliked - it tasted very strongly of maraschino cherry, almost like medicine. But hey, there's a reason we didn't order it, and our friend seemed to really like it. \n\n* Blushing Bee - 4 stars\n(Mt casa reposado tequila, maurin quina, velvet falernum, lime, orange citrate, lavendar bitters. $12)\nMy bf's drink - he describes this as having herbal flavors, boozy, kind of tangy, and refreshing. I found the tequila to be quite strong in this drink, but despite that the flavors surrounding it came together well. \n\nPersonal note: the other drink I was eyeing was the Henriette (with ginger beer and grapefruit bitters) - must try this next time!", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-09-23"}], "scrimshaw german style pilsener": [], "big eye ipa": [], "north indigo pale ale": [], "two rivers huckleberry cider": [], "london pride english pale ale": [], "paulander hefeweizen": [], "domaine bergerie de lhortus rose": [], "sete cepas albarino": [], "sauvignon blanc chidaine val de loire": [], "la cabotte cotes du rhone": [], "uncaged cabernet": [], "pinot noir steele": [], "proseco la marcca": []}
