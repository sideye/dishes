She wanted steak and lobster and this is the better option I could find within a short time frame. We got a decent table on the second tier facing the water. Once our food came around though it had gotten really dark to see our food. So, about the food: I ordered the mushroom and cheese ravioli in tomato basil cream sauce, my mom ordered a large crab plate, my younger siblings just ordered off the kid's menu, and I honestly did not see what the rest of the adults ate. I asked for lobster bisque as a starter for my mom and I to share, because one, a bisque always sounds tasty, and I saw it mentioned in many reviews. The waitress brought it out with 4 spoons but no other small bowls. I do not mind eating from the same bowl as my mom but others wanted to try as well, and I was not about to have them dipping their spoons in over and over. The waitress looked at me a little funny when I asked, but that's okay. I found the taste to be amazing, but to my surprise my mom quickly stopped eating. \"I can taste too much butter\", she said. She also thought maybe too much heavy cream. I had a few more spoonfuls before deciding she was probably right. My mom's crab with mashed potatoes (they don't have baked potatoes) came out and she was ecstatic. My circular ravioli, covered in the cream sauce, looked okay as well. I never have been and never will be into sauces being slathered sll over my meals. But I gave it a shot. All I could really taste was the semi-firm eggplant in the pasta. The sauce, much like the bisque, was so heavy in cream. I looked at the plate and remembered it was $21. I was not hungry enough nor interested enough in the plate to justify that. I sent it back and asked for a simple side of mac n' cheese, which was made with gruyere and truffle oil, supposedly. I liked it better and couldn't even finish half the bowl. I was much happier with my $8 pasta. \n\nThe food was good and the service was professional. She wasn't a spunky waitress by any means but she was helpful. She also made sure to bring out a little dessert for my mom's birthday. Overall, I did like the food, and there is a small chance I'd come back to try the Dungeness crab cake.

I had a very so-so experience last year, and this year my experience was genuinely bad.\n\nWe had reservations for our party of 10. When our group was complete, we were seated promptly, but not given menus by the host. We waited for a full ten minutes before a server arrived to take drink orders. We then had to ask him for menus, which it took him a few minutes to obtain.\n\nDrink orders followed, and were filled, and the server nicely agreed to provide us with separate checks. We then had a pretty long wait to finally order food. We ordered calamari, clam chowder or salad, and entrees.\n\nThe calamari, clam chowder and salads were delivered in a fairly reasonable timeframe, and consumed. The calamari was good, and the clam chowder was rich and savory, but lacked substance in the form of vegetables and clams. We then waited and waited (at least 40 minutes) for our entrees to arrive. \n\nMy dish, the Pan Seared Sea Scallops from the Featured Items section of the menu, looked ok, but my first bite of the butternut puree was extremely salty. My first fork of the saut\u00e9ed greens was so salty that they left my tongue with a stinging sensation. That saltiness was what had permeated the puree. The dish was completely inedible.\n\nWhen the server returned after a few minutes with the last of the entrees, I explained the problem. He took the plate away and returned in about 10 minutes with a freshly made plate, with freshly cooked greens. The scallops were just warm, were on the small side, didn't have much of a sear or much seasoning, but thankfully were not over cooked. For a $32 dish, this didn't cut it. It wasn't inedible like the original dish, and I was hungry, so I ate most of it. I wasn't tempted to clean my plate.\n\nBeyond my own complaint, my companions indicated that the Petrale Sole was very dry, and the single order of White Clam Linguini was bland, going un-eaten after the first taste. As the table was cleared, the completely full dish was taken away without question at to why.\n\nEveryone was tired and ready to leave (we had been there for 2 1/2 hours) and so we opted to have dessert and coffee elsewhere (rather than have another lengthy wait), and requested our checks. We all agreed that we had been there too long.\n\nTo his credit, our server produced our separate checks relatively quickly, and without complaint. We were not charged an automatic gratuity as a large party, which was refreshing. My check for chowder, and the scallop entr\u00e9e (no drinks) was $44, and not a good value for the food quality. \n\nAs I indicated at the start, my first experience here last year wasn't one that caused me to want to go back. This year, I yielded to the organizer tried to give it a second chance.

Years ago, my husband and I were really impressed with both the food and service. I've always wanted to come back and tonight my husband planned an anniversary dinner date. He read the yelp reviews before making a reservation and thought maybe people were just being too picky. This is a big nope. When he called to make the reservation, the woman he spoke to was very friendly and stated that since it was our anniversary, she would make make a note if it and make sure we had the \"best table in the house\"... We checked in early to have a cocktail at the bar and when we got there the one of the two older gentlemen could not locate our dinner reservation. There was also no note that it was for an anniversary. The hosts had no personality. You really need people to be friendly and welcoming, especially when patrons are coming in. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our drinks along with the company of the bar tender. If I had know better, I would have just stayed at the bar and let him help us the rest of the evening. When we finally sat down, we weren't even acknowledged by our waiter for a long time. We weren't in any rush but at any other restaurant we would have already been welcomed and asked about drinks. We noticed he also had a table of ten meaning there was was no way our 2 person order would compete with but still, we are also paying customers. On top of this, since we look \"young\" waiters have always made us a lower priority even though we are millennials with money to spend. We were served cold bread. The crab cocktail was great but really not worth the price for the portion. I ordered the lobster bisque and my husband was craving clam chowder. The bisque, again, was great. The clam chowder had a weird seasoning and bacon added... Why?? I don't know why restaurants insist on trying to change up clam chowder but this was not what we had wanted at all.

We were placed in a table that FACED diners with views of the SF Bay, literally. Instead of being seated across from each other, we were given a rectangular table with a bench on one side as the only option, forcing us to side BESIDE each other (-1 point), while watching the people with the view eat. Awkward.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu and placing our appetizer orders, I went to the restroom and on my way back, I had spotted a couple having finished with dinner and ask a passing waiter if we can take that spot. He gave me the reassuring wink and said for me to \"wait a few minutes while if it's available\". Even before I made my way back to my original bench/chair, I saw a new couple being seated at the recently vacant table. I was just starting to accept our seat arrangements, when the couple from the table across from us stood and left. Now I knew that I had to make my move. The waiter remembered and had us promptly moved into the table with chairs on opposite ends. (+1). (score is even)\n\nWe started with the appetizers: steamed manila clams and dungeness crab cake. The clams were seasoned just right but we found the crab cakes to be swimming in too much oil (they say it was the lemon butter sauce) that drowned out the flavor (-1).

We started with some KJ Chardonnay (always a winner) and the broiled green mussels appetizer. Nice presentation but wasted on our palates.  I've eaten better mussels at a hot dog stand.\n\n4. Mama had the Atlantic salmon which was good but served with new potatoes.  Who the hell still serves new potatoes except in prisons or cheap wedding receptions at the local Motel 6?!  Slap that piece of fish on a bed of sauteed spinach with some garlic mashed underneath, period!!\n\n5. I had the Alaskan halibut which for $27.00 should melt in my mouth!!  I cook better fish than this insipid piece of Gortons styrofoam on my plate and I'm not good at cooking fish. Oh and it also came with some scalloped new potatoes, some spinach and balsamic reduction.  Who the hell told this chef to put balsamic reduction on a piece of fish?  And why the hard on with these friggin' potatoes?  \n\n6. During our meal, we had the pleasure of overhearing Danny Bonaduce's twin tell one of the staff that he was going to do an In and Out burger run.  Not a bad idea.  I'll give you $20 bucks to go fetch me a double double with fries and you can keep the change to buy yourself a new shirt without any armpit stains.\n\n7. At this point, we decided to forego any dessert or espresso and just enjoy our conversation and company instead.\n\n8. The service was the only positive about the restaurant.  Competent and capable, the guy reminded me of Rollie Fingers (Google it to find out why) and he did his job well.\n\nAnyway, for now I'll just keep enjoying my gf's sea bass steamed with white wine, butter and lemon or head over to Capannina per un buon pesce!!\n\nI just thought of one more thing as I write this; last year we dined at Kuleto's on Powell with some friends from Paris (France y'all, not Texas) and it sucked as well.  Not even the service merited a pat on the back.  I'm thinking that SF is somewhat overrated about the whole food scene.

Only problem was that, our seats wasn't facing (or even near) the window seats with the views that were raved about in the Yelp reviews. We were placed in a table that FACED diners with views of the SF Bay, literally. Instead of being seated across from each other, we were given a rectangular table with a bench on one side as the only option, forcing us to side BESIDE each other (-1 point), while watching the people with the view eat. Awkward.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu and placing our appetizer orders, I went to the restroom and on my way back, I had spotted a couple having finished with dinner and ask a passing waiter if we can take that spot. He gave me the reassuring wink and said for me to \"wait a few minutes while if it's available\". Even before I made my way back to my original bench/chair, I saw a new couple being seated at the recently vacant table. I was just starting to accept our seat arrangements, when the couple from the table across from us stood and left. Now I knew that I had to make my move. The waiter remembered and had us promptly moved into the table with chairs on opposite ends. (+1). (score is even)\n\nWe started with the appetizers: steamed manila clams and dungeness crab cake. The clams were seasoned just right but we found the crab cakes to be swimming in too much oil (they say it was the lemon butter sauce) that drowned out the flavor (-1). The crispy parsnips in the crab cakes added texture, as well. \n\nFor the main meal, I had the Sacramento Delta Sturgeon and my dinner partner had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi. I found the Sturgeon to be meatier (a bit tough) than what I had expected; texture reminded me of an old tire. (-1). I enjoyed the fact that the sturgeon was bacon crusted and the ghnocchi that came with my meal was soft and delightful, as well as the sugar snap peas being cooked perfectly al dente.
