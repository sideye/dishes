Hope you enjoyed this place, I did but my wallet didn't. However, no regrets whatsoever, this place is truly a gem.\n\nPresentation 5/5:\nI booked this place on a Wednesday evening. The lighting and conversation level was much more relaxed than the other Michelin Star restaurants I've been too. The tables, utensils, furniture, and even the decorations on the wall were all so simple, modern, yet had a touch of poise and elegance, as if Gianni Versace breathed on this place. \n\nCustomer Service 5/5:\nI'm so used to sliding into my seat that I was surprised when the waiters/waitresses were pulling out my chair and tucked the chair in when I adjusted myself accordingly. Never had that before and for the few hours I was here, I truly was feeling Upper Echelon. Though when that check came, that feeling drained out the window...\n\nAnyway, great recommendations. Water cup was never empty. Wine was always refilled before the last sip. Paired the perfect beer for the remaining dishes on the menu. And even offered to provide additional desserts, which we declined because we were  already full.\n\nWhen they saw us get up for the bathroom, they even hurried to open the doors for us. Don't get that everyday.\n\nMeal 6/5:\nCoi provides an incredible tasting menu. I have had everything on the menu before, separately but their take on the dishes was phenomenal.\n\nMy favorites:\nGeoDuck - caramelized duck cream, clams, and green onions\n\nPortion size is similar to teacup level so you really do need to enjoy this one.\n\nHalzenut - hen egg, parsnip, caramelized salsify, and puffed rice\n\nThis one is on par as far as taste level but man, the halzenuts to the salsify, to the rice, to the cream they pour over everything was to die for.\n\nBeef - black trumpet with fermented pepper toffee\nThe beef is imitation wagyu, it was that delicious and the sauce was amazing. Tasted like a $10,000 oyster sauce\n\n\nOverall, had an amazing experience. This place is somewhere you take someone, or even yourself, to be pampered. It is pricy ($250 a person) and there is an automatic 20% gratuity. \n\nPlease do your research before you come! The couple sitting in table next to us didn't.

It's crazy to see all the mixed reviews from previous dining experiences here and a big reason I've never eaten at Coi before. However as of late, this place is at the top of it's game, well deserving of 2 Michelin stars and in my opinion, bordering on 3. Are you ready for this review?! Good, because it was top 3 fine dining meals of my life. \n\nUpon arrival the staff greeted us with a smile and I handed my three bottles of wine to the sommelier. Those included: \n\n- 1982 Baron Philippe de Rothschild Chateau d'Armailhac, Pauillac, France\n- 2010 Radio-Coteau Vineyards Alberigi Pinot Noir, Russian River Valley, USA\n- 2012 Brewer-Clifton Gnesa Vineyard Chardonnay, Santa Barbara County, USA\n\nArmed with silly wines, we were escorted to the private dining table in the back of the restaurant. The staff promptly informed us of \"what they do\" at Coi and what to expect for the evening. Pure elation. \n\nHere were our courses (spring menu): \n\n1. Geoduck Clam, Lardo, Bibb Lettuce, Buckwheat - texture, spot on.\n2. Asparagus, Oscetra Caviar, Yuzu Anglaise - technically speaking, the most beautiful dish I've ever eaten.\n3. Ocean Trout, Citrus Confit, Chartreuse, Fines Herbs - the herbal notes from the Chartreuse paired perfectly with the fish and citrus. Crazy.\n4. Turbot, Root Vegetables, Beurre Cancalaise - look at my picture. Turbot (pronounced Turbo) isn't a particularly scaley fish. Those \"scales\" in the picture are tweezered root vegtables made to look so. Insane! \n5. Cod, English Pea, Cockles, Mint - the English peas are so flavorful right now and worked so well with the seafood.\n6. Abalone, Bone Marrow, Artichoke, Black Truffle - i can't describe this any better than the description itself. \n7. Grapefruit, Pastis, Black Pepper - a great palate cleanser. \n8. Coconut Cannoli, Rhubarb, Hibiscus - the Italians should take a few notes ;) \n9. Almond Cake, Preserved Lemon, Amaretto Caramel - perfection. Not too sweet, just balanced almond amazingness. \n\nThe service was impeccable, attention to detail unlike anything I've experienced before. No one hovered or stayed too long, they were funny when needed to be and timed everything to perfection. Well done. \n\nAfter a perfectly executed meal, still the highlight of my night was the company. My friends. Loved Ones. Meals like this put big picture stuff into perspective...I'm a very lucky person and I try not to take that for granted. \n\nNothing short of a brilliant evening.

Luckily we arrived at 7:00 on the dot, after enduring traffic for 2 1/2 hours, and the staff calmly greeted us as we practically ran inside the door. From the outside, you probably wouldn't be able to tell that Coi is a Michelin star restaurant. The atmosphere inside was very quiet, proper, and upscale, with servers wearing 3-piece suits, who walked back and forth and stood on each side of the room looking around and checking on everyone. There was also one guy who constantly refilled our waters. I felt like royalty! \n\nOur server Andrew arrived & greeted me happy birthday. He was personable and made us feel comfortable despite the formal environment. He asked us if we had any allergies or anything, so my boyfriend reminded him we wouldn't be drinking alcohol, so Andrew recited a list of non-alcoholic beverages that we could try. We ended up deciding on sparkling rose lemonade - wow it was delicious! \n\nThe menu included 8 courses, but Andrew informed us that there would be a few surprises here and there from the chef. In total, we had 13 items! They were all very small portions, but that was perfect because it allowed us to have enough room to finish each item and try numerous things. \n\nWe started off with puffed brown rice crackers served with avocado puree. It was a perfect start to the delicious courses to come. Then, our server brought out a bowl of blood orange ice mixed with pink peppercorn & black lime - meant to be a palate cleanser. It was such an odd thing to be having a \"palate cleanser..\" that's when you know you're fancy!\n\nI should note that after each course, they were very quick to take away any dirty plates and bring brand new utensils each time. \n\nNext up was my favorite dish of the night: California sturgeon caviar! It included caviar on top of a 2-hour poached egg yolk, creme fraiche, and chopped chives. I've never had caviar before, but it was DELICIOUS. The saltiness of the caviar was perfectly paired with a creamy egg yolk and the creme fraiche.. My mouth is salivating as I think back about this dish..\n\nOkay back on track. Next dish was the geoduck topped with radish slices and salad burnett...in simple terms, beautiful tiny little flowers. The geoduck tasted just like fresh clams. The flowers threw me off, as I don't even like the smell of flowers, let alone eating them. They did pair well with the fresh flavor of the clams. Next was chilled pea soup topped with larger nasturtium flower petals. I loved the presentation of this one, but it was my least favorite taste of the night. I blame that on my dislike of peas and flowers though - nothing to do with the actual creation of the dish. I felt like a terrible person if I didn't finish but luckily my boyfriend enjoyed that one.\n\nNext, we had a stuffed and baked artichoke topped with a thin lardon layer and fava beans. They brought it out then poured olive oil right in front of you, another beautiful presentation touch. It was a nice small bite right before the next larger dish: morel- encrusted trout, served over sliced asparagus and a brown butter/sorrel juice sauce. Now let me tell you, I'm not a huge mushroom or fish fan, but WOW this course was amazing! The trout melted in your mouth, almost reminiscent of a sashimi taste. \n\nThen, we had steamed tofu mousseline, yuba, mushroom dashi. It smelled & tasted like miso soup.  There was a creamy aspect which really added a lot of flavor. After, we had aged grilled duck with spring greens and a fermented duck broth vinaigrette. This was also a very hearty dish with a bigger serving. \n\nAnother surprise from the kitchen to start off the dessert course: black sesame mochi with strawberry and rhubarb. It was so beautifully presented too..a common theme of the night if you haven't noticed. Luckily we had more dessert coming our way: frozen whipped rhubarb. It was served with cilantro - such an odd combination but it really worked. Who knew? Our next desserts were coconut pandan cake, served inside a dark chocolate ball that you break with your spoon, and apple filled brioche with a hazelnut creme, a birthday dessert from the kitchen. That was probably my favorite dessert! Then they brought out the check with two hand-pulled taffies in miso and lemon-hibiscus. \n\nOverall the menu had a very fresh theme and it was very nature-like. Everything was cohesive, full of flavors you wouldn't expect to work, but it did! Although I didn't know half of the things on that menu (I used google a lot while I wrote this review, don't judge me), I've learned that when you come to these upscale restaurants, you have to have an open mind & open palate, or else you won't enjoy your experience.

I probably should be embarrassed but before our visit I was (incorrectly) referring to the restaurant [phonetically] as \"coy\". Upon entering I was diplomatically corrected - it is \"kwah\". Ok, the French pronunciation. Got it.  Now let's talk about the food.\n\nEvery bite was special. We started (consecutively) with a brown puffed rice cracker and a grape ice with salt - both were interesting teasers for the variety set to come. I liked the caviar on the poached egg yolk - one of my favorite bites of the night. The geoduck was a particular treat. I'd never had geoduck before, although I knew it as the alien outer-space looking curveball ingredient from Top Chef and other cooking shows. The cherry tomatoes from the Chef's garden, lovingly peeled, and served in olive oil was another highlight - so simple but so perfect. Our salmon dish was cooked perfectly but didn't seem crazy innovative. Still, it was phenomenal. The summer corn served in broth was interesting as one of 11 dishes but I'm not sure I would have ordered it on its own.  I was looking forward to the potato dumplings but this was the one dish that I didn't quite get. It was beautiful and elegant and delicate but I did not love the flavors. I thought the pastured beef in the seaweed powder with cauliflower, pickled cauliflower and parsley pur\u00e9e was superlative-worthy. I thought it was absolutely fantastic. I preferred the raspberry to the melons and I loved the frozen dark chocolate with the infused marshmallow inside. It was crazy how when I bit in, I tasted the chocolate and the marshmallow and then maybe a full second later I was hit with a citrus explosion - how did they do that? \n\nWonderful meal. Loved it. My wife did too - great birthday.

"], "author": "Elliott D.", "review": "Took the wife here on Valentine's as a surprise--I'm sure she was delighted when we parked between the two strip clubs!\n\nThere we supped on the 11 course tasting menu:\n\n1. Frozen Mandarin Sour - Angostura Bitters, Kumquat, Satsuma Ice\n\nA light & wispy start; delicately shaved ice infused with bitter & salty kumquat flavors. The precision & quality made it much more impressive than your everyday snow cone. Amazing. \n\n2. Clam - Geoduck and Manila, Bull Kelp, Meyer Lemon, Wild Fennel\n\nChunks of raw clam adorned with kelp & some gelatinous concoction in the same shape & design as the kelp. Little sprigs of fennel provided a delicious contrast to the strong flavors of the sea.\n\n3. Pasture - Beets Roasted in Hay, Fresh Cheese, Wild Sprouts and Flowers\n\nOh sweet divine! The beets were crushed into a paste & mixed w/ mild farm cheese w/ chunks of beet to add texture. Garnished w/ edible flowers & leaves, some of which had stems with a strong bitter flavor to compliment the lightness of the beet mixture. Indescribably perfect!\n\n4. Crab Melt, California Style - Steffan's Lardo, Wheatgrass\n\nI thought nothing would beat #3, but this crab melt was just so rich & savory that it met the challenge. Distinct & creamy crab flavor fused onto a small piece of toast with ideal crispness. Delicate sprouts placed on the plate selectively & wheatgrass puree was lightly poured in a circle around the offering--this proved invaluable for dipping and balanced the creamy values. Wow.\n\n5. Farm Egg - Cauliflower, Nettle-Dandelion Salsa Verde\n\nAt this point we said, \"That's it. They can't beat what's been served.\" The next dish was a fried egg on top of vegetable salsa w/ croutons. When the fork entered the white of the egg, we realized it had actually been whipped into a creamed foam with amazing gastronomical properties. As I do, I saved the yolk for the end by first carefully enjoying the tangy dandelion salsa (crucial bitter accents). The yolk was softer than soft-boiled egg yolk--almost raw. As I sucked it in, I got a little misty at this sacred experience.\n\n6. Earth and Sea - Steamed Tofu Mousseline, Mushroom Dashi, Yuba, Fresh Seaweed\n\nReminded me of a soup we'd had in Kyoto in a kaiseki meal, except the flavors were a bit stronger (suited to a Westerner's palate). Tasted like dry tofu skin that's added to many Chinese soups. The mushrooms were soft & supple. A light & refreshing entree.\n\n7. Savory Wild Mushroom Porridge - Crisp Root Vegetables, Cress, Sherry\n\nA rich & buttery brown porridge w/ mushroom base. Cress garnish--the sherry was a foam that engulfed the entire dish & resembled dish-soap suds. The sherry bubbles were a light & tangy contrast to the rich porridge. The crisp root vegetables looked like little oddly shaped potato chips, similar consistency, but not oily. This was either to be eaten like chips or added to the porridge.\n\n8. Prather Ranch Beef - Potato, Coastal Grasses, Monterey Cypress\n\nA sublimely tender piece of beef trimmed to perfection. No visible marbling, but holy crap it didn't need it. Perfectly tender & rich--everything that a piece of steak should be. Served with little mounds of creamy foam that were actually potatoes whipped with cream and olive oil. Delightful. The coastal grasses were also bitter leaves, a perfect compliment to the dish. A favorite.\n\n9. Grilled Cheese - Tomme D'ossau, Rye, Onion, Pickled Daikon\n\nTiny grilled cheese sandwiches on rye--bold & flavorful cheese. The daikon pickle was an interesting choice, and there was a little sauce that turned out to be onion marmalade. Yum.\n\n10. Fennel Sorbet - Ruby Grapefruit, Campari, Pomelo\n\nAs we'd had fennel ice cream at Chez Panisse, we assumed lack of creativity, but then this fennel sorbet kicked the trash out of Chez Panisse's--tiny & bold (fennel sorbet beats fennel ice cream), flanked by slightly saltly grapefruit ice (similar to the opening dish but a different citrus) & chunks of actual grapefruit, which I was expecting to be quite sour in contrast to the sorbet, but they had been doused in some kind of sweet perfumed liquor which tasted Arabian. Fabulous. Would made a nice perfume. Film of gelatinous substance draped on top. Bravo.\n\n11. Coffee Cake - Medjool Date, Raw Milk Ice, Lime\n\nNot terribly heavy, the coffee cake was drenched in a dark caramel sauce and adorned with wafers that tasted like Ritz cracker pie. The raw milk ice was the creamiest milk-flavored ice cream I've ever tasted. Undeniably delicious.\n\nAll in all:\n\nWe've been to many fine dining establishments over the years, all very good, but somehow none have topped our experiences at Gary Danko--we assumed Coi would be the same way. Starting with the beet dish, however, we knew it would be a close call. By the end, we had concluded that while Gary Danko's service & quantities are greater, the courses we'd had that evening at Coi were the best we'd ever tasted in our lives.

"], "author": "Ziyan C.", "review": "PROS:\n- Love the decor. Minimalist/ modern/ casual.\n- Well lit! I love being able to SEE my food.\n- Excellent service. We asked for the background on our courses & got great stories on where the ingredients came from & how they were cooked (there's so much science & thought behind every step). I was cold & my server kept bringing me glasses of hot water (perfectly mixed w/ cold water to come out to a nice lukewarm).\n- Each course was SO well presented - like a piece of art. \n- Very accommodating w/ dietary limitations.\n- 10 of 11 dishes were hits. The dishes are very buttery & rich. Delicious, but filling. Faves: Clam, Pasture, Crab Melt, Unrefined Sugar. \n\nCONS:\n- Way too overpriced. Only one course had meat. Only affordable b/c my friend charged part of the meal for her business trip ($180pp bill turned into an affordable $60).\n- Earth & Sea was just not worth any amount of money. It tasted like miso soup w/ some fancy ingredients that didn't add to the flavor. \n\nTHE FOOD:\n* Frozen Mandarin Sour (angostura bitters, kumquat, satsuma ice) - Very interesting! The ice salty was (& the salt comes from a riverbed in Australia!) & cold, paired w/ slightly bitter/tart & chewy kumquat was a really great way to start off the meal. \n\n* Clam (geoduck & manila, bull kelp, meyer lemon, wild fennel) - If you love seafood, you will love this (otherwise - seafood overkill). The geoduck clam had a really interesting chewy texture &it was interwoven w/ kelp & another type of clam manipulated to look like kelp. Sprinkled w/ fennel - perfect.   \n\n* Pasture (beets roasted in hay, fresh cheese, wild sprouts & flowers) - An unexpectedly sweet dish, thoroughly enjoyed! The beets added just enough flavor so the sweetness of the goat cheese wasn't overpowering. There was a hint of smoky flavor from the hay. The wild sprouts/flowers had a hint of bitterness like an onion bulb!\n\n* Crab Melt, California Style (staffan's lardo, wheatgrass) - Very well done, rich, interesting use of textures/ flavors. I'm not usually impressed by crab appetizers but this really won me over. The lardo made it very rich & filling & was chewy, there was a crunchy layer underneath. The wheatgrass puree tasted funny by itself (bitterish) but went great w/ everything else.\n\n* Spring Allium Soup (soyoung's etude, smoke, almond) - Amazing. Rich. Delicious. Onion bulbs & scallions added that slight bitterness, crunch, & fresh flavor. It countered the saltiness of the soup perfectly. Almonds came in huge chunks though - sliced smaller would be better. \n\n* Earth & Sea (steamed tofu mousseline, mushroom dashi, yuba, fresh seaweed) - Major disappointment. Like miso soup, or any other generic Asian broth, except they added some yuba (which they went to great lengths to describe, but it's just tofu skin which my family cooks at home all the time). \n\n* Savory Wild Mushroom Porridge (crisp root vegetables, cress, sherry) - Another incredibly rich but wonderful dish! I usually don't like mushroom to be the main ingredient in any dish as it's got such a dominating flavor but they really make it work here. Maybe the porridge absorbs some of it. This was just so savory, thick, & full of flavor. The chips added some texture to your liking, & actually made the porridge lighter. They were great to eat on their own too.\n\n* Prather Ranch Beef (potato, coastal grasses, monterey cypress) - Tenderloin beef - so incredibly tender & soft! The potato puree just tasted odd. The sauce & the greens went well w/ the beef though. My boyfriend had chicken as a replacement - I found it a tiny bit dry & the sauce overly salted (it just didn't go as well w/ chicken as w/ beef) but he really enjoyed the texture, had no complaints.\n\n* Carrots Cooked on Coffee Bean (creme fraiche, green olive oil, cilantro) - Very interesting! I would've preferred the whole baby carrots sliced as their flavor overpowered a bit. If you got a bite w/ plenty of coffee bean & sweet granola, you hit the jackpot. Creme fraiche was great. But most bites were mostly carrot.\n\n* Fennel Sorbet (ruby grapefruit, campari, pomelo) - An amazing light dessert. Bitter grapefruit, cold sorbet, tart pomelo = perfect combination.  \n\n* Unrefined Sugar (moscavado cake, medjool date, raw milk ice, lime) - I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE DATE CAKE!! It was spongy, moist, delicious, and warm. The raw milk ice was amazing, smooth, & was basically a cold burst of the best milk I've ever had. The granola-ish sweet sprinkles added texture. Just the crackers were a little TOO sweet - I had a bunch leftover at the end because too much tended the ruin the flavors of everything else.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-02-28"}, {"excerpts": ["Some comments on 9-course tasting menu:\nRadish Tartelette - beautiful but tiny and rather boring thing, can work as amuse bouche but rather unworthy as a dish;\nGeoduck Clam - something tiny, looks cute but no taste except salt; I am trying to remember more ", "but I can't\nOcean ", "Trout - little cubes of lightly cured trout were rather good and tasted fresh;\nDungeness Crab - salty and reminded me of fake crab meat from some plastic package;\nLittle boring bread with elaborately constructed butter, a bit salty and not very fresh tasting\n", "This first 4 courses are all cold, on salty side with unrefined muddy taste and no bright notes of acidity.

By combining the clam's hints of subtle sweetness with the geoduck's fish-fragrant flavor of the ocean, and adding in refreshing bites of bull kelp which suggested the presence of coastal waters, this dish brought the sea to the plate. \n\nThe dish that followed, which Chef Patterson entitled \"Pasture,\" caught me by surprise. Described as \"BEETS Roasted in Hay, Fresh Cheese, Wild Sprouts, and Flowers\" I expected a simple, semi-firm roasted beet on a plate. However, what arrived was more of a thick beet pur\u00e9e, with the fresh Andante cheese combined with the mashed red beets to form a soft, creamy puddle on the plate. Simply topped with a smattering of wild sprouts and flowers, I felt like the best fed horse in the history of the world.\n \nThis was followed by a taste of the California coastline: a CRAB MELT with Steffan's Lardo and Wheatgrass. I was suddenly transported back to the local farms of California with the next dish: the FARM EGG with Cauliflower and a Nettle-Dandelion Salsa Verde. The egg's gooey richness, the cauliflower's firm but succulent flavor, and the freshness of the greens were in perfect harmony and communicated the unique location of these ingredients.\n\nThen came yet another surprise: Savory Chanterelle PORRIDGE with Crisp Root Vegetables, Cress, and Sherry. The last time I saw porridge on the menu was on a visit to the Three Bears' House, and even though I thought that the bowl I had there was just right, I was wrong. The warm, comforting, coziness of this earthy dish absolutely blew me away. Despite my initial reservations, this was not only my favorite dish of the meal, but one of the most memorable dishes I've experienced at Coi.\n\nAnd although there's never much meat on Coi's menu, every time they do it, they do it to perfection.  The taste of the Prather Ranch BEEF, with Potato, Coastal Grasses, and Monterey Cypress was so pure and cleanthat it would almost be unfair to other restaurants if Coi offered multiple meaty selections on the menu.\n\nFinally, in my mind putting a GRILLED CHEESE sandwich on the menu is taking a big risk. I quietly thought to myself, \"Okay Patterson. Bring it.\" Oh, and he brought it my friends. Oh yes...he brought it. As skeptical as I might have been, that grilled cheese sandwich, with house-made pickles, was just about as close to flawless as a sandwich can get.\n\nI left thinking two things. The first: \"Wow. I can't believe I just fell in love with porridge.\" But more seriously, my second thought was that Coi, which I've regarded as the best fine-dining restaurant in the Bay Area for some time, is only getting better.

I'm a bit of a Michelin hound and I was very excited to dine at Coi as that would complete my set of 2 star restaurants in the Bay Area. I even went as far as to change a flight when I found that Coi were shutting down for a summer break on the original day of my arrival in San Francisco.\n\nCoi was the first restaurant on my week of fine dining in the Bay Area. I was honoured to have local Yelper Tammy C join me and she also brought along 2 of her friends.\n\nAs usual, I did arrive a bit early at the restaurant and decided to wander round the area to get a flavour of the surroundings. Well, I soon discovered that Broadway is the red light district and I beat a hasty retreat back to the restaurant. In fact, Tammy C's cab did try to drop her off in front of the strip club next door and she got him to move forward to Coi's front door!\n\nDaniel Patterson is reknowned for turning fresh produce into interesting and unique combinations in his nightly 11 course tasting menu, the only option.\n\nThe calm interior of the restaurant soon blocks out the garish neon outside and you soon feel cocooned in an atmosphere of salivatory excitement.\n\nService was efficient as plates came and went, each announced in the expected Michelin way.\n\nSo, as you can see, I've given Coi 4 stars when really, a 2 Michelin star place should score 5 stars. Why was this?\n\nI did enjoy the flavours and flavour combinations that the food imparted but I did find that the 11 courses were very similar. About halfway through the meal, I did start to worry slightly that the dishes seemed to be all carriers of flavour with little foundation. My palate was crying out for a bit of texture, some crunch, something to chew on as a contrast to the overload of flavour. Also, all the dishes were served cold or at room temperature.\n\nSadly, this pattern continued for all 11 courses. I so wanted to love the food at Coi but it felt all too much molecular with too little gastronomy. What I did eat was tasty but afterwards, I hankered for a burger with some onion rings - something hot to chew on and something crunchy.\n\nFor the record, the dishes were:\n1. Milk & Tea - sheep's milk ricotta, wild chamomile, lemon\n2. Geoduck clam, cucumber, almond, cilantro\n3. Earth & Sea - new harvest potatoes, fresh seaweed, McEvoy olive oil\n4. Chilled yellow squash soup, buttermilk, nasturtium, lime\n5. Morel porridge, Englsih pea, coyote mint\n6. Young carrots roasted in hay, sprouts, radish powder, pecorino\n7. Slow cooked farm egg, brown butter, buckwheat, shitake\n8. Cook It Raw - Prather Ranch beef tartare, Douglas fir\n9. Abbaye de Tamie cheese, spring greens\n10. White chocolate pudding, blueberries, lemon verbena\n11. Cake & Ice Cream - caramelised chocolate cake, raw milk ice cream\n\nMy favourite dish was probably the geoduck where I would have never guessed that it went so well with cucumber, almond and cilantro. The slow cooked duck egg was also interesting as it was cooked at 60 degrees - Tammy and I had a chance to eat other slow cooked eggs later that week, cooked at other temperatures!\n\nIt wasn't a bad start to the week; it just didn't hit the heights of other 2 Michelin star places I've been to. My advice would be to rethink some dishes - within an 11 course menu, there must be place for some hot, crunchy and more substantial dishes.\n\nP.S.

I consider myself a foodie and look forward to opportunities like this quite a bit.  And though my wife and I had a really wonderful time with two of our favorite dinner companions at Coi, that good time was much more related to our conversation than the food or the entire dinner.\n\nAt over $200 per person (and note, we brought our own wine!) there were three dishes, out of eleven, that earned a unanimous \"this is absolutely delicious\" from our table: warm morrel mushrooms prepared simply in butter to perfection; a dish of geoduck served beautifully with almond; and a tiny, salty chocolate cake at the end.  \n\nI actually couldn't finish one small dish:  carrots roasted in hay.

One, two, three... ELEVEN.  That's how many courses you have here if you eat in the dining room.  We are a pretty normal group of four people, but we were all kind of dreading the last two courses.  We felt stuffed and two of us needed to get home to relieve a baby-sitter.\n\nAnd the final summary for me is that they were batting three for eleven last night.  That might start in the Giants lineup, but for less than 30% of the meal to hit their price point?  A fundamental problem is the confusion of weird with good.

I have been debating for weeks now what score to actually give the place, because I know it should be a 5 star restaurant, the problem is they don't live up to that potential in any way, at least as far as I'm concerned. Finally, I decided to go with how I truly felt as I left the place, the one restaurant I was most excited to visit on my week long trip there, a 2 Michelin star restaurant that is inventive, playful, and skilled, but which somehow left me with the biggest sense of disappointment and wteffery that I have experienced from a restaurant in perhaps as long as I can remember. Where the hell is all the protein?\n\nI need to take a brief moment before going into the food to talk about the service, because that was just as memorable, if not more, in a very bad way. Our waitress was completely dull, lifeless, and somewhat robotic. She never once engaged us other than to give a brief description of the food, and she talked down to us through most of the night. It honestly felt like we were on some kind of interview, and it was not going well. This is a shame, because I absolutely loved the setting of the restaurant, which was probably my favorite aspect of the entire night.

"], "author": "Anthony N.", "review": "***While I do not love Coi as much as Saison, Atelier Crenn, Manresa, or Benu, Coi's food can be both delicious and impressive; in a city full of innovative restaurants, Coi's utilizes seasonal, local produce to create several simple but very pure and enlightening courses that are hard to top***\n\nI did not love my first experience at Coi.  There were several great plates of food, but Coi just did not measure up to other highly regarded restaurants in the area like the unique gem Saison.  Coi underwent a re-design a year or so ago and the restaurant looks great.  The room is much more contemporary now and the dining room's unique location within the building provides an intimate and exclusive feeling experience.\n\nCoi is still doing a single tasting menu only approach though I enjoyed the presentations more on this visit and the food felt more vibrant.  The food was still on the dainty side, but there was just too much delicious and one-of-a-kind food here to ignore this restaurant's greatness.\n\nMy favorite plate of the night was the soup course, which was a reinvention of the fall classic butternut squash soup.  Instead of just having a thick and sweet soup, their soup combined a creamy, rich and sweet butternut squash custard that was topped with a warm and comforting butternut squash and apple consomme, crisp and tart apples, and crunchy pumpkin seeds.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#4Fiac5CzwblEGtL8dOG2nw\n\nI also really liked their Santa Barbara uni course, which was very refreshing.  Sweet and creamy uni was paired with a risotto-like mix of kohlrabi, crisp radishes and bright yuzu.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#TTd21eNNOjmrUkrOTxnyiQ\n\nA traditional caviar flavor combination was made more special by the smoking of egg yolk in olive oil; the smoked flavor was prominent alongside the salty and briny caviar, the light creme fraiche, and the chives.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#oguKOcvDxC6SoNfN0gVQJg\n\nThe beet was good too with a meaty but soft center contrasted against a crispy and petrified-like skin.  I liked the garnish of mustard greens though the miso sauce did not stand out much.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#K5yHY9lZ9cuY0q37FGXlJQ\n\nNon-protein dishes really shined.  I loved the silky potato and pine needle puree topped with perfectly grilled matsutake mushrooms.  The ability of the kitchen to achieve so much textural and flavor depth in the mushroom was impressive as you can feel and taste each mushroom and biting into the mushroom allowed the squishy rubberiness of it to shine; it also allowed its flavor to develop and change.\n\nSome of the more substantial courses were still light.  Seasonal and warm dungeness crab was wrapped in celtuce and then paired with bitter greens and a fragrant tarragon puree.  There is definitely a lot of simplicity here as Coi tries to achieve a purity in the ingredients' flavors as opposed to showcasing assertive seasoning or sauces that take over the plate.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#XSa1AQnz3VsUkmeaEcFoBg\n\nI did feel the New York Strip could have used a more assertive approach though.  It was the most substantial course and it was a little boring to eat as the flavors were not as great as the other courses that preceded it.  The seaweed encrusted beef was nicely cooked; it was tender and moist.  I really liked the fragrant parsley puree as well as the brown butter and bone marrow roasted cauliflower, but I wish the steak had a stronger beef flavor.\n\nDesserts had bright spots like a caramelized cake, a perfectly poached pear and a crunchy and nutty pistachio tuile, but I wish there was one dessert that matched the great things the kitchen was able to achieve with the savory courses.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#s6MdzdQ84xh7JW4VRRvdrQ\n\nService was excellent.  The food came out at an even pace while the staff was professional and polite but still personable and welcoming.\n\nPrices are high and portions are small, but Coi serves several impressive, elegant and unique courses that you will not find at many restaurants in the U.S.\n\nI was significantly more impressed with this trip to Coi than my first visit a few years ago.  It could be the season (this trip was during the fall while my last trip was in spring or summer), but I actually think the team and kitchen has evolved more as the food has become more vibrant.  The restaurant's point of view too--its goal to achieve and celebrate the purity, flavor and texture of each ingredient--came across much more on this visit and really illustrated how unique this restaurant is in an area filled with many innovative fine dining restaurants.\n\nMetered street parking is available.", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-12-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Wild King salmon wrapped in Yuba (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=7oV2X0aHOVrykgv7VjRRZg) - charred cabbage, sauce of dried scallop and ginger\n\n9) Matsutake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=mW9VEoRoS-ilnYY8r_BWEw) - potato - pine needle puree\n\n10) ", "Matsutake - this dish confused me...

My experience may be tilted some because, about a month ago, I met a shopper at the Ferry Farmers' market and learned that he was buying produce for Coi.  I happened to bump into him the morning of this dinner and mentioned that my cherry would be popped that evening in dining here.  He kindly asked the general manager to stop at our table and he graciously invited us to the kitchen after our meal for a short tour, which my hosts and I enjoyed.  Love the personal touches.  The food rates four plus in my book as my photos are testament that presentation is huge.  An extra half star for the stellar service and the awesome VIP treatment by Andrew and the GM.

Regrettably, my experience confirms recent 2 and 3 star reviews point for point.\n\nApparently there may be a back story to all of the bad reviews Coi has earned of late.   The kitchen has acquired new staff - it is in some kind of transition - at least according to a reporter in the Chronicle.\n\nOnly 3 out of the 11 courses were Michelin-worthy.  I am in complete agreement with recent revewers:  the goat cheese tart was satisfyingly complex (the flavor and texture evolved over time); the sunchoke-buttermilk soup was soothing and rich; and the grilled abalone was punchy and flavorful.  All other courses; however, could be rather generously classified as \"intellectually interesting\", pretentious, and emotionally hollow.   If I were to summarize:  the meal lacked soul.  \n\nCost control seemed to rule the thinking behind this particular menu.  \n\nOnly 2 out of the 11 courses incorporated any protein - unless you include the rather one-dimmensional chicken/egg savory finale with its \"crumble\" of chicken skin conservatively sprinkled over a slow cooked egg.   \n\nOne course consisted of two small slices of matsutake mushroom with a watery potato-pine puree.

By the end of the savory phase,  I was desperately looking forward to ending the meal on a high point - to recover my prior losses, so to speak.\n\nUnfortunately, this did not happen. The deconstructed squash cake had a nice complexity, particularly as my now flavor-starved mouth, crunched down on the occaisional pomegranate seed.  But the Faux-Souffle offered up few rewards other than its base of average chocolate, capped with a dry, foamy, flavorless, fluff.\n\nI must say that the service was excellent.    The ambiance is subdued, comfortable, and keeps your attention where it should be: on the food.\n\nThe problem lies in the kitchen.  It takes ego and hubris to put out a meal like this.  It is extremely cynical to charge so much ($550 for two with wine pairing), and yet offer up so little in return.   On the night I was there, I noted that the chef served foie gras and sweetbreads to the table on my immediate right.  This table featured a restaurateur who ordered from the same fixed menu I did.  I realize this is simply professional courtesy on the part of the chef (apparently a typical gesture), but it perhaps explains the great reviews in the press and in the various food guides.   The chef apparently makes an effort when it is in his direct interest to do so.\n\nThe rest of us, however, have to remain contented with hay, sprouts, baby carrots, and slow-cooked eggs.  \n\nI left the restaurant feeling angry and guilty for letting myself be influenced by the hype.", "rating": 2, "date": "2009-12-25"}, {"excerpts": ["Abalone was pretty good, Matsutake Mushrooms with Pine Needle Puree was interesting- extra points for innovativeness (pine needle extract was used to make the puree), but I didnt  like the pine needle puree at all.

I loved my experience at Coi but since it had its \"misses\" in service and a couple of dishes I gave it 4 stars, not 5.\n\nCoi is more than  just dinner its a \"dining experience.\" The 11-courses tasting (mandatory in the dining room) is like a roller coaster- exciting, thrilling, sometimes a little disappointing and scary, but altogether a great ride. I love that chef Patterson is risky and innovative in his menu. \n\nThe decor is very contemporary and upscale, minimalist, and definitely set for a special occasion.  When you first walk in you'll see a lounge area where people can order bites and drinks.  The dining room is separate and seats about 40 people.  My first impression was that I liked the decor alot, though some would say its a little sterile (grey and brown all over).  I like the cool rice paper-ish ceilings and the  funky fuzzy pillows which makes the place a little more hip. Very New-York-ey (good in my book).\n\nThe tasting menu started out really disappointing to me, but as the courses went on they got better and better. The first couple of courses were really weird and kind of gross actually. I thought that the milk and honey capsule amuse bouche (see picture with 2 spoons) looked really cool but tasted pretty gross. When you bit into it this surprising burst of milky sweet liquid gushed out and I didn't like the taste at all. The pink grapefruit granita had WAY too much ginger in it, though the texture and concept were kind of cool.  The shiny beets were good, but just good- simply cooked beets with a good olive oil and some herbs. So far I was disappointed. \n\nThen the meal turned around--Oysters Under Glass- by far the BEST OYSTER I have ever had--medium-size oyster seasoned with yuzu sweet and sour vinaigrette and what tasted like crunchy shallots. It was beautifully presented with a \"glass\" cover--some gelatinous clear sheet place delicately over the delicious oyster. I could have eaten 10 of those. Roasted Cauliflower Soup with bone marrow was creamy, smoky and delicious, had a nice foam on top--I licked my bowl clean. The Kabocha Squash soup was silky smooth and good, but I'd say too much ginger.  The Earth and Sea tofu soup was pretty disappointing b/c it tasted like some chinese restaurant corn starch soup. It was ok, but nothing I'd expect at a restaurant charging $120 per person.  Abalone was pretty good, Matsutake Mushrooms with Pine Needle Puree was interesting- extra points for innovativeness (pine needle extract was used to make the puree), but I didnt  like the pine needle puree at all.  Slow Cooked Farm Egg--very good (same as other's reviews of it).  Chicken Stuffed with Sweetbreads and Pig's Feet- this was THE BEST CHICKEN ever, it almost tasted like pork b/c it was so juicy, and the skin had a nice layer of gelatin and fat on it. \n\nThe BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT- Quince and Huckleberry Parfait- OH MY GOD this dessert was absolutely perfect!!! The bottom was huckleberry puree, hucklberry granita, and almond brittle. Cold, fruity and crunchy. The top layer was a light, sweet, whipped cream/milk. The creaminess and crunchiness offset each other perfectly. I would go back to Coi just to order this (you can do this at the lounge area).\n\nThe presentation of all the dishes was beautiful and flawless.\n\nThe service was fine and pretty formal--napkins folded when gone, all the usual fine-dining etiquette but I would have appreciated a little more friendliness. Sometimes I couldn't even get a smile from the waiter. Perhaps this is all part of the image Coi is going for but just because you are at a fine restaurant doesn't mean you have to have stiff service. The service did improve as the meal went on. The sommelier was awesome, really friendly and recommended some great wines to us.\n\nI agree with the other Yelpers that there was TOO much salt on some dishes, and the ginger flavor was overwhelming in some dishes. But considering how innovative and risky Chef Patterson is in his menus, I would expect that sometimes there will be some not-perfect dishes. I'd definitely go back.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-11-09"}, {"excerpts": ["A second contender was the \"Pan Grilled Matsutake.", "\" ", "That's a mushroom btw (I didn't know what it was at first either).

At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it. To me, it was simply a drop of water in an ocean of SF restaurants that I had to venture to. As the years passed, I heard more and more positive reviews from friends and other Yelper and gradually formed the opinion that Coi was a must-try. Add to that the growing reputation of Chef Daniel Patterson as the closest thing that SF has to \"molecular gastronomy\" and Coi's crowning achievement of two Michelin stars. Even then, somehow the stars never aligned for me and Coi to meet until tonight. Well, it was worth the wait.\n\nI came here with a couple friends as a bon voyage dinner for one of those friends who was moving away. So it was a bittersweet occasion. When I first walked in, I was greeted by the host in the lounge area. The restaurant was smaller than I expected, seating about 20 in the lounge and about 30 in the main dining room, yet it was very warm and cozy. The d\u00e9cor was minimalistic and reminded me of Benu's d\u00e9cor a bit. Coi definitely embraces the concept of California cuisine: daily rotating menu, fresh ingredients from local vendors, and artisanal products ranging from the cheese to the full assortment of Heath ceramic tableware. My friends and I sat down and prepared ourselves for the 11-course tasting tour we were about to embark upon. Suffice it to say, we were excited.  \n\nThe first course was the \"Childhood Memory of Harvest\"--Coi's homage to the Fall harvest. It consisted of vegetable leathers (think of it as fruit roll-ups but made with onion--tastes much better than it sounds!), a walnut tuile, a beet \"pillow\", apple, nuts, and a complimentary glass of pear cider. And we're off to a great start! Next up, \"Marin Miyagi Oysters\" on diced wheatgrass and lemon ice served in an ice-chilled bowl--an excellent and unique combination of flavors that brought the freshness out of the oysters. Plus, I never thought wheatgrass could taste so good! Batting 3rd was an \"Inverted Cherry Tomato Tart\" that looked more like a Napoleon pastry than a tart.  The top layer was a black olive crisp that sandwiched fresh cherry tomatoes sitting on a bottom layer of basil sauce. Delish! The 4th dish was probably the most interesting: \"Chilled Fennel Consomm\u00e9\" with sea urchin and purslane. The broth was light and smooth and complimented the saltiness of the sea urchin well. The purslane provided some texture to balance out the sponginess of the sea urchin. All in all, a really good soup.\n\nNow, bring on the meats! The \"Monterrey Bay Abalone Grilled on the Plancha\" was a tad on the salty side for my tastes but was executed well enough to not have the \"fishy saltwater\" taste I normally associate with abalone. Not my favorite dish of the night, but solid nonetheless. The \"Wild Black Cod Smoked over Beet Charcoal\" came with creamed leeks, beet-red flame grape sauce, horseradish, and dill. A contender for dish of the night. The cod was luscious and almost melted in my mouth. A second contender was the \"Pan Grilled Matsutake.\" That's a mushroom btw (I didn't know what it was at first either). It was served on top a bed of potato-pine needle puree.  That's fancy talk for a REALLY good mash potato. Again, the mushrooms were a bit overly-salted but, man, did they taste good! Rounding out the meats was the \"Prather Ranch Beef\"--a tenderloin and some beef cheeks terrine. The tenderloin was, well, tender and flavorful and you can't really go wrong with beef cheeks.\n\nNow, on to my favorite part of any meal--the dessert! Starting the dessert portion was a lovely Cavatina cheese. I sure do love cheese!! And this Cavatina sure was lovable! Rich, creamy, aromatic...some sprigs of wild arugula paired with the cheese quite nicely. I then looked at the menu to see what was next: cheesecake. Ok, I love cheesecake! But, cheesecake made of goat cheese?! I was skeptical at how good goat cheese would be in a cheesecake. Boy, was I wrong! First off, it wasn't really a cheesecake in the traditional sense at all. It was more like a deconstructed cheesecake: goat cheese \"foam\" + grape sorbet + graham cracker tuile=dessert heaven and my favorite dish of the night! If that wasn't enough, there was one more course: \"Apples Scented with Burnt Cinnamon\". Take baked apples, iced buttermilk, and hazelnut and you've got a recipe for deliciousness. Top it off with a fresh cup of Blue Bottle coffee and the night is set!\n\nOur 11 course tasting adventure ended with 3 happy (and full) adventurers! Eating at Benu had temporarily soured my desires for long dinners but the 3 hours at Coi didn't seem that long and the dishes were paced appropriately. There wasn't a single dish that stood out as a \"superstar\" dish but the 11 courses together created a great overall dining experience. Coi doesn't quite topple Gary Danko from the top of my SF list but it's up there with Chez Panisse, Commis, etc--maybe top 5 all Bay Area, definitely top 10.  I'd go back for sure!", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-10-20"}, {"excerpts": ["Paired with a Japanese lager that was -meh.-  \n\nMATSUTAKE WITH POTATO PINE-NEEDLE PUREE\n"], "author": "Andrea C.", "review": "This place seems to be a place you will either *love* for the culinary experimentation, or hate because (as some people have put it) they feel unsatisfied by the portion size.  I found that the flavors that Coi chose to combine in some of their more daring dishes was stuff i would have never thought would work together and did, and in the things that seemed more like crowd-pleasers (like the frommage tart and the milkshake), the flavors were all amplified and in your face.  \n\nIn essence, you should only come to Coi for an adventure in eating, not a buffet all-you-can-eat.  And that is what you'll get.  Is it expensive, yes!  Is it worth it?  yes.  \n\nWe went on a Friday night, and the subtleties of good serving etiquette were honored to a \"t.\"  We decided to do the pairings of alcohol, just to see what the chef had in mind for us.\n\nWe started with a milk-honey ball, which is an amazing culinary creation using science.  Also delicious.  None of the texture of honey, but enormous flavor of honey.\n\nPINK GRAPEFRUIT ginger, tarragon, black pepper\nthis was an amazing taste flavor amazement.  But you have to like grapefruit and be into having sweet, salty, bitter, and sour all attack your mouth at the same time with a little pepper to match.  The ginger, tarragon and pepper were all in foam and mush form on the top and a touch salty, and tasted fantastic.  This dish came with a little fragranced oil that one was to smell while tasting the dish.  It added something totally amazing to the experience, because the nose is the key to your tastebuds....Add to this a sparkling pink wine (i didn't catch the name).  I don't even like sparkling wine, but with this dish, it's fan-freakin' tast\n\nSHINY BEETS citrus scented gel, vadouvan (fermented curry)\nThis was a rather small dish and i don't adore beets, i'll be honest.  My first experience with fermented curry, and it's super strong and delicious.  The pairing was a peach l'ambic served just a touch too cold, but which worked incredibly with the meal.  \n\nFROMAGE BLANC TART early girl tomatoes, mcevoy olive oil, verbena\nDeliciously strong cheese flavor (like a gruyere-brie combo), and delicious crust.  The beans were delicious with a tomato vinaigrette. This was served with a Leth Roter Veltliner.  Not one of the stronger pairings for my taste.  \n\nCARROTS AND ARTICHOKES BRAISED IN BUTTER\nSome of the most delicious vegetables i have ever eaten.  Paired with a listless von H\u00f6vel Riesling.\n\nSPINY LOBSTER SALAD radish, bramley's seedling apple,fennel, chervil\nAbsolutely fabulous and served with my favorite wines of the night, a 1997 Riesling from Richter that was deliciously minerally and less sweet than most whites.  \n\nSAUTEED MONTEREY BAY ABALONE escarole, parsley-caper vinaigrette\nI haven't yet had a good experience with abalone.  The first bite was good, with a wave of different flavors from the citrusy craziness of capers and vinaigrette to the buttery taste of the abalone and oil.  Further bites were disappointing.  Paired with a Japanese lager that was -meh.-  \n\nMATSUTAKE WITH POTATO PINE-NEEDLE PUREE\nTasty delicious mushroomy mushrooms.  Paired with a Verdelho that gave it a little something more with each bite.\n\nSLOW COOKED FARM EGG\ngreen farro, gold chard, brown butter-parmesan sauce\nThis thing was fascinating and delicious.  Perfectly cooked, and witha rosemary foam on the top that was delicate and bursting with flavor, along with some beautiful buttery quinoa.  The chard was slightly bitter and added a nice contrast.  Paired with a Peay Chardonnay, which may make me like white wines....\n\nSEARED BIG VALLEY RANCH BISON gold turnips and their greens, black olive\nThe dude who complained about these two dishes clearly doesn't like bitter veggies.  I get it.  However, i felt the amazing contrast between these flavors:  the buttery non-gamy taste of the bison that was cooked absolutely to perfection that it nearly melted in the mouth with the super-bitter of the turnip greens helped one appreciate both.  Paired with the Bachannal Cab which was a typical good CA cab.\n\nCheese course - Etude (goat cheese) halal dates, walnuts, peppercress\nDelicious cheesy goodness.\n\nQUINCE PARFAIT huckleberry, almond brittle, thyme\nFreaking amazing.  Berenlesser Steiner dessert wine (passable).  I want to eat this for dessert every stinking night.  Came with a creme foam with a subtle touch of almond flavor.\n\nMICHEL CLUIZEL \"CONCEPCION\" GANACHE seascape strawberries\nAbsolutely freaking amazing!  Served with a delightful Cordova Sherry and CA sweet vermouth that added an extra umpf that made the chocolate ganache crazy delicious.\n\nVanilla/olive oil milkshake + chocolate chip cookie truffle\nI love dessert and all of these desserts made me a little wet.  I confess.\n\nI don't know what that dude before me believed he was coming for (all you can eat Perkins?), but i was uncomfortably full by the time the night was over.

Better to up-size a savory course and hold back a bit on the sweets. \n\nEvery plate of food can't wow you.  We all have different preferences.
