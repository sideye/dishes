Pad Woon Sen was also a good dish and a nice change from the usual Pad Thai/Pad See Ew that I order.\n\nSomething I don't usually comment on is food presentation - Marnee Thai hit the mark with their presentation.

I saw all three guests on \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" rave about it while Leslie Sbrocco was having one too many glasses of her reserve chardonnay. Unanimous praise is not that unusual on that program, but the dishes looked so uniquely succulent for what I thought would be just another Thai place that I couldn't resist its allure. Now here's the challenge these days. Jamie W. and I are going all plant-based with our dining choices, so we were wondering if we would be able to find anything on the menu to compete with the likes of the Spicy Angel Wings or the Stir-Fried Stewed Pork Belly, both of which I would have easily ordered and devoured just weeks earlier.\n\nWell, it turns out our concerns were unfounded as their vegetarian options are genuinely tasty and satisfying here. First things first, Marnee Thai passed my spring roll test, the true litmus for the quality of any Southeast Asian fare that lies ahead of me. The $7.95 Summer Rolls, a seasonal special, were crispy-fresh with just the right consistency in both the rice noodles and the wrapper. Yes, I recognize there was shrimp in them. Don't expect me to be perfect, OK? Bottom-feeders are in my diet, I swear. Regardless, the hoisin peanut sauce was the perfect complement (see photo). We then shared two veg-head dishes. The first was Jamie's predictable choice - the $9.50 Pad Thai Vegetarian, which mixed the savory fried rice stick noodles and fresh bean sprouts with a bounty of stir-fried vegetables - broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, snap peas, asparagus and baby corn (see photo).\n\nWarmed tofu, egg and a carpet of ground peanuts completed the picture. It was a nice, fresh execution on an old standby. But I have to tell you I was completely blown away by the $9.50 Spicy Ma Kuer, a peasant-style plate of saut\u00e9ed eggplant with mushrooms, fried tofu, baby corn, bell pepper, chili, garlic and Thai basil (see photo). Again, it was the consistency of the eggplant that really made this dish almost carnivorous in nature. But the eggplant has no face and no mother, so I'm cool. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat, and I can't wait to try the Pumpkin Curry next time. So if you find yourself in the Inner Sunset after an afternoon traipsing around Golden Gate Park, I say this is a great place to rest your weary bones and indulge in some of the tastiest Thai food I've had in this fair city of ours.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...robust flavors pop at this compact, busy place\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit tight in there\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...genuinely attentive and quick\nTOTAL - 5 stars...could be my go-to Thai vegetarian place from now on", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-05-10"}, {"excerpts": ["So I went with pad Thai with beef and spicy angel wings.

We almost went to another place  that was close to our hotel and after that fell through, we came here. We had to park across the street at Golden Gate Park, but it wasn't too far for us to walk. \n\nIt was a packed house, yet people kept coming in (even when we were seated, I noticed that). Since we were a large party (my sister, brother-in-law and family- three nephews), we had a bit of a wait. One of my nephews and I counted all the awards/recognition plaques on the wall, across from the waiting area (seats along the wall)- there were 24 in all! The smells were intoxicating (I love Thai food!), the crowded restaurant reassuring, and the accolades added to my expectation of good Thai food.\n\nThough they were busy, the staff was extremely nice and quick at times- it was a team effort, as different people took the empty platters (ok ,a couple of things were forgotten, but that's ok). The ladies were wearing beautiful richly colored costumes in jewel-toned hues, complete in gold trim (sapphire, fuschia, purple); guessing they were brocade silks? It's funny, I don't really remember what the men were wearing, maybe the standard black pants and white shirts. The walls were adorned with framed prints. There were a set of clear glass large vases with tall flowers (fake), which kind of reminded me of Pottery Barn- it was elegant and simple, but still very pretty. (Sometimes Thai restaurants' decor seems gawdy and awkward.) Our seats we're half booth and half chairs. The front door is left open but your clothes are still going to smell like food. \n\nWe ordered summer rolls (perfect, but I knew my husband wouldn't like it; it's probably the mint that he doesn't like), spicy angel wings (don't normally eat wings but I tried one, pretty good), thai style fried rice (has cucumbers, tomatoes, and extra cilantro), beef salad (excellent!!! really enjoyed it since I never order it when it's just me and my husband), chan pad poo (spicy rice noodles with crab meat and egg in chili garlic sauce- 1st time I ever had it- and it was excellent! but my brother-in-law didn't really like it), and panang (potatoes, curry, coconut and basil- pretty good). The food is served on square platters and is in good sized portions, except the summer rolls (might be an appetizer M.O. thing, though). It's a good thing that the food didn't come out at the same time since we were running out of room on the table! Our oldest nephew probably didn't eat as much compared to us adults (but then again he isn't fond of chinese food, either). Three of us ordered diet soda and thai iced tea.

And trust me, I have REALLY high standards and expectations about the quality of food for EVERY cuisine. If I wasn't a school administrator, I'd honestly be a food critic or personal shopper. Being born and raised in a Chinese-Thai family, good food and restaurants were ALWAYS a priority for my family and we would drive an hour or two away to eat good food. That's just the Chinese way...with that said, here's my bottom of the line, no nonsense review:\n\nEvery SINGLE time I visit SF, I always have to stop by Marnee Thai. This is the newer location and has a more contemporary feel to it. The employees work hard to make the dishes authentic and provide outstanding customer service. From what I hear, they wake up at 3am to prepare special sauces that would not be found anywhere. The chef has received several accolades for his desserts (coconut hot cakes and roti), pad-thai (#1 in all of California), and has guest lectured at some of the BEST culinary institutions in the country. I've been to Thailand about a dozen times and truly and genuinely believe the food tastes way better than food in Thailand! In regards to cleanliness, if you compare it to the streets of Bangkok, I would have to say it's 100 million times cleaner and healthier than those street vendors. \n\nSO yelper HATERS of Marnee Thai 9th Ave, STOP THIS NONSENSE about the bad press. I understand freedom of speech but if you go to a \"good\" Chinese restaurant or even Italian restaurant, you are going to find that restaurants aren't perfect. I firmly believe that Health Department inspector EXAGGERATED information in his report in order try bust several restaurants to prove himself and trying to use the restaurant as leverage to move up in his position. Totally unfair. \n\nLet me give you my top 5 must haves: \n\n1. Their Hor Mok (for all you seafood lovers) is my husband's FAVORITE dish. If you are feeling daring, I'd recommend this dish especially if you like a little spice in your food. (Score: 10/10)\n\n2. I'm an avocado lover. I LOVE their avocado salad. This is a fusion dish, not authentic Thai--just FYI. (Score: 9/10)\n\n3. Roti Dessert. I love carbs and dessert. The fresh dough with condensed milk makes my mouth water! (Score: 8.5/10) No Thai restaurant in LA makes it the way they do. Note: This is the Thai version of crepes without the nutella and fruit. \n\n4. I always compare the same types of food at every restaurant. My friends make fun of me because I'm a creature of habit. Therefore, I always order Pad-Thai. If a restaurant can make good Pad-Thai with the right sweetness, spiciness, and other flavoring I guarantee they can make other dishes just as well. Pad-Thai is a safe choice for all of you newbies who are conservative. You can't go wrong with the Pad-Thai at Marnee Thai! (Score: 9.5/10)\n\n5. The last classic Thai dish I love is \"Tom Yum\" with shrimp. At Marnee Thai, it's steaming hot, spicy, and sour.

The other couple arrived earlier than us, so they snagged a table before the lines got long around 6pm on Saturday. \n\nWe were seated all the way in the back. Service was so very slow, it took forever for someone to come by and take our order- it was busy but still!. Then we watched waiters come in with food, hoping it would be ours, but it was served to all the other tables but ours. 45 minutes later our food finally came. 45 minutes?! Maybe after 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter came by saying our entrees were on the way but they got backed up. Seemed weird especially since everyone in the back room had left except for our table and a table of 3 sitting next to us also waiting on their food. \n\nOn to the food. I can't vouch for the other couple's food, but as for me and the boy, we shared the Tom Ka and a tofu panang curry. Tom Ka was decent- we had it with vegetables and tofu. Slightly salty for my taste and pricey for the portion. The tofu curry I would never order again. The fried tofu was just deflated and the sauce was pretty oily and was different from all the other panang curries I've had before. Didn't seem creamy at all and was pretty bland. They put steamed broccoli on the side- I thought they'd add some veggies or something in the curry itself. So considering all of that it was not worth the $10.95. Usually tofu dishes are cheaper than meat dishes, but this dish was the most expensive thing on the receipt. Really?! $11 for tofu, bland sauce, and some steamed broccoli? The portion was so freaking small too!\n\nTook another 15-20 minutes just to get the bill- and it wasn't even thaaat busy.\n\nDisappointing experience.

We ordered the appetizers and a couple of entr\u00e9es. We asked if she could come back so we could keep looking and give her the rest of our order in a short while. She said that it would be better if we ordered now so the kitchen wouldn't be confused. So she stood there as we tried to figure it out (awkward and uncomfortable). We finished ordering...two people of our party arrived late and we ordered again. It's like she was half there, talking to another waitress in thai as we were ordering/ asking us to repeat our order. At some point she left and we yelled for her because we weren't done talking to her and didn't know if she understood our order. In the end, she did get it. \n\n\nAppetizer: \nSpicy Angel Wings- alright, super greasy, good flavor\nTom Yum & Tom Ka soups- both really tasty. \nThai Potstickers- It never came so we had to reorder.

It would have been nice to dial down the sugar or sauce to make it possible to savor the flavor of the crab.\n\nOverall it was pretty enjoyable though getting a seat can be kind of a pain.

I was celebrating my friend's birthday so I didn't want to do the obnoxious \"Omg don't eat that yet!!!  I need a picture!!!\"\n\n[PART ONE: THE 5-STAR COMPONENT]\n\nThis place has some seriously tasty food.  Yup, I'm talking about Thai comfort food carby goodness of stir-fry noodles and fried rice.  \n\nThe noodle and rice dishes definitely tasted different from your average Thai place, which usually derives more flavor from greasiness than sauce.  Marnee Thai's noodles/fried rice had the homemade touch: there was something about the soy sauce/fish sauce/secret ingredient that was reminiscent of Thai temple style cooking.  \n\nI would recommend the Thai fried rice (a lot of chicken and veggies, not just all saucy rice), pad kee mao (interesting that they add a layer of black pepper on top, but I liked the extra kick), and pad Thai (though the shrimp weren't very fresh).  \n\nWe also had the Panang beef curry.  Instead of a bowl, it came in a dish so IMO it was more like stir-fry.  I think it was a bit too salty and there was this weird mayo sauce, but the beef was tender and the curry was alright.\n\nRumors say the angel wings are highly recommended, but personally I would say it doesn't beat the famous San Tung chicken wings.  To my understanding, angel wings are supposed to be stuffed, but the ones at Marnee Thai were just deep-fried wings with a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, sprinkled with some fried basil and served on an aesthetic square plate.  Be warned that some people found it rather spicy.  Not bad, but it didn't stand out--the noodles and fried rice were the main highlight.\n\n[PART TWO: THE 1-STAR COMPONENT]\n\nThe main drawback is the service.  Or more like the management... essentially their business practice is finding every way possible to make us order lots of food.\n\nWe came in a large group, and it was nice to have the back room, which had great decor and was separated from the noisiness of the rest of the restaurant.  However service was spotty; some people didn't always get their water refilled.\n\nThe main problem was that they kept convincing us to order more food.  Our initial judgment would have been fine, but because they were so adamant that it wouldn't be enough, we ordered more and in the end everyone was stuffed and we had a lot of leftovers.  The portions are big, so if you go in a group I suggest a ratio of 2 dishes for 3 people (assuming no one is ravenously hungry), and perhaps some appetizers for flair.\n\nWe also asked for rice, and they were sneaky in putting in an order of rice for EVERYONE.  We only finished a small fraction and took the rest to go after we found out how much they charged us for it.   \n\nThey were nice though, smiling and being courteous and all.  My chief complaint is the shady business.  \n\nPS This review is dedicated to the bday girl!

The woman who waited on us was hilarious! (Could she be Marnee?  Not sure, but she's definitely in charge).  While she was a little pushy about the amounts and types of foods we should order (okay, really pushy), we all got a good laugh, and ended up with what we wanted.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered pumpkin samosas and spring rolls - the pumpkin samosas were delicious, and I would absolutely order them again.  The spring rolls weren't the best I've ever had, but we did get quite the lesson on the importance of the sauce that's served with them - she even served it onto our plates for us.  We were waiting for her to go around and tuck our napkins into our shirts for us, but alas, that never happened.\n\nDinner was fabulous as well - #64 pumpkin curry, #46 pad thai, a couple other really tasty noodle dishes (#41 and #42, although we weren't exactly expecting noodles), #22 panang beef curry, and some chicken and green bean dish (I think #29).  There wasn't anything that I didn't like.  The beef was really tender and flavorful, and the tofu and pumpkin was out of this world.  As for the noodle dishes, none of them were greasy, and they all had their own distinct flavor, which makes it hard to choose a favorite.\n\nTo add to the meal, we were fortunate enough to be seated next to another large party - a birthday party - that received the royal treatment from the staff - I assume they brought the cake themselves, but it was brought in with a little more than the usual flair - lights out, a gong, and strict instructions not to blow out the candle until after we'd all sung happy birthday to the poor young man.  \n\nAll in all, it was a great experience, and I would definitely go back for the food and the entertainment!", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-04-09"}, {"excerpts": ["And my daughter's Panang Beef was so tender and flavorful.\n"], "author": "Brett W.", "review": "After seeing Marnee Thai featured on \"Check Please Bay Area\" combined with my love for Thai food we had to go.

She raves about Marni Thai. We finally got a chance a few weeks ago and lemme tell you, I was excited. Unfortunately after walking out after a really uninspiring dinner, the disappointment set in really quick. I suppose I should have known better that on a Saturday night there was the whole back room open and no wait. \n\nThere were 3 adults and two kids, who love their Thai as much as I do. We all placed our orders and anxiously awaited our allegedly divine food. My sister ordered a sea bass in garlic sauce. It looked good, but damn was it oily and just not flavorful. I took a few bites and was waiting for 'the' flavor to jump out at me. Never happened. 3/4 of the fish sat in its oliy sauce only to be thrown out. Strike 1!\n\nOn to my Pad Kee Mao. It's my favorite noodle dish. I order it at every Thai place we go to no matter what else is ordered. I love the leftovers for breakfast. What I was served was nothing resembeling any Pad Kee Mao I have ever had. What was placed in front of me was a heaping sticky mess of saucy red rice noodles, some chicken, and occasional chili and I think a piece of onion. This is supposed to be a spicy dish, but is was sticky sweet. I don't know what the hell this was meant to be, but I almost asked if I had been served the right dish. Strike 2!\n\nThen there was the green curry. My 9 year old could eat a bowl of green curry every day of the week. The hotter the better as well. He's not a normal kid. His curry was a huge bowl of very average tasting, not spicy bamboo shoots and chicken. There was a fair amount of chicken, but an insane amount of bamboo shoots. I estimate that there was 2 or more cups which I considered to be filler. He likes the shoots, but I felt this was a cheep move on their part. I think I make a tastier green curry at home. Strike 2 1/2!\n\nOh, yes, and then after a good 20 minutes of being served all but one of our dishes, my daughter's bbq chicken arrives. I thought that we were actually going to leave without her eating. It probably would have been better to have not even have ordered it. It was so lacking flavor.It was very obvious that the chicken had not been marinated for very long at all. I was hoping that it would have been served with some exciting sauce like all good Thai BBQ chicken is. It wasn't. The sauce was the same sauce served with both bland appetizers. I guess there is only one type of sauce that this place serves. It was some sweet stuff, but that's about all I can remember. Blah! Strike 3!\n\nWhen we left, I didn't say anything to my sister who had been to Marni maybe 15 times or more. She finally broke the the tension and said that it was not good at all and that she expected much better like her other visits. Then she said that there is a second Marni that opened in town. I'm wondering if they took the good cooks and are using them at the new place to get it going. Such a bummer. I really, really wanted to like this place, but it truly sucked. Maybe I am spoiled because I live in LA which has the largest Thai population outside Thailand and we have a pethora of good Thai places to choose from.

They have two locations, one on 9th and the original one on 22nd and Irving.  Some people say that the original one is the best, but what some people fail to acknowledge is that the REAL original chef... the one that won ten thousand cooking awards... is the chef at the 9th and Irving restaurant.  I've never been to the one on 22nd, but all i know is that the one on 9th ROCKS MY SOCKS! \n\nThe restaurant seems small when you first walk in, but they also have a back room with some tables back there.  So, the restaurant actually seats quite a lot of people.  The waitresses are all thai, and you know how I know?  Because I've been to Thailand, and I've heard their language, and they also write all the orders in Thai.  You can't say that this place is not authentic.  The waitresses are really attentive, and offer great service.\n\nEverything on the menu is pretty much SUPERB!  My favorites are Angel Wings or Angel Tofu.  They have a sauce that they use on the wings or tofu, just like the San Tung wings, but with a different twist and just as good, or better!!  did I really just say it was better than San Tung chicken wings??  Yes, I did.  When I tried the angel tofu, it made me a bigger fan of tofu... so now I always get the angel tofu when I'm with friends because I want people to know how good tofu can be! \n\nMy 2nd favorite dish would be their Hor Mok.  It is Sea Bass (I think) in curry mousse, with cabbage and some other veggies.  The fish is cooked in a leaf, and is just really... one of the best things I have ever had!  When they don't have this, I get their other fish--BASA FILLET ................................................................................................................................12.50\n  ....Basa fillet pan-seared topped with you choice of sauce\n  ....* Pork, ginger, mushrooms and onions\n  ....* Spicy mushroom and Thai herb in curry sauce.

Its the closest thing they have to the 3-flavored fish in other restaurants.\n\nMy 3rd favorite is their Pad Kee Mao.  Their spicy noodle sauce is sooo good.  It's not dry, instead, it's very flavorful!  I absolutely love it.  \n\nMarnee Thai is so good that we always order it for catering for UCSF school events.  \n\nYou can't really go wrong with anything at Marnee Thai!!

The ladies were wearing beautiful richly colored costumes in jewel-toned hues, complete in gold trim (sapphire, fuschia, purple); guessing they were brocade silks? It's funny, I don't really remember what the men were wearing, maybe the standard black pants and white shirts. The walls were adorned with framed prints. There were a set of clear glass large vases with tall flowers (fake), which kind of reminded me of Pottery Barn- it was elegant and simple, but still very pretty. (Sometimes Thai restaurants' decor seems gawdy and awkward.) Our seats we're half booth and half chairs. The front door is left open but your clothes are still going to smell like food. \n\nWe ordered summer rolls (perfect, but I knew my husband wouldn't like it; it's probably the mint that he doesn't like), spicy angel wings (don't normally eat wings but I tried one, pretty good), thai style fried rice (has cucumbers, tomatoes, and extra cilantro), beef salad (excellent!!! really enjoyed it since I never order it when it's just me and my husband), chan pad poo (spicy rice noodles with crab meat and egg in chili garlic sauce- 1st time I ever had it- and it was excellent! but my brother-in-law didn't really like it), and panang (potatoes, curry, coconut and basil- pretty good).

First things first, Marnee Thai passed my spring roll test, the true litmus for the quality of any Southeast Asian fare that lies ahead of me. The $7.95 Summer Rolls, a seasonal special, were crispy-fresh with just the right consistency in both the rice noodles and the wrapper. Yes, I recognize there was shrimp in them. Don't expect me to be perfect, OK? Bottom-feeders are in my diet, I swear. Regardless, the hoisin peanut sauce was the perfect complement (see photo). We then shared two veg-head dishes. The first was Jamie's predictable choice - the $9.50 Pad Thai Vegetarian, which mixed the savory fried rice stick noodles and fresh bean sprouts with a bounty of stir-fried vegetables - broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, snap peas, asparagus and baby corn (see photo).\n\nWarmed tofu, egg and a carpet of ground peanuts completed the picture.

The actual vegetables seemed fresh and were colorful and of good quality-this included zucchini, broccoli, baby corn and a nice mix of peppers. AND they didn't skimp on the red and green peppers like some other Thai places do. I was slightly disappointed in the tofu that came in the dish-there were only 3 pieces in it and they were a little oily. However the curry itself and the veggies were so good, it more than made up for it.\nMy boyfriend got some kind of sweet and sour chicken, sharing my brown rice.

The weather was perfect in San Francisco today ~ sunny with a slight breeze.  We found parking on 9th Avenue, just a few cars up from the restaurant.\n\nWe missed out on the lunch crowd and looked forward to a nice meal together.  Our friendly waitress took our order of the following: Spicy Angel Wings, Panang Beef, Guay Tiew Koor with an extra serving of Roasted Duck plus Jasmine steamed rice.  Iced water for all and a Thai iced tea for me!\n\nI had never had their Spicy Angel Wings and they certainly did not disappoint me.  The chicken wings and drummettes were sauteed in a garlic-chili sauce, then deep fried with crispy basil set atop this finger licking sweet and spicy dish!  I like my food spicy so I will ask them to make it spicier next time.  As an option, you can ask for deep fried spicy tofu instead of the chicken wings/drummettes combo.\n\nChunks of tender beef with panang curry paste, coconut milk and Thai basils make one of our favorite main courses called Panang Beef.  We had the lunch portion which is half the size of what you receive for dinner. Both the lunch and dinner portions are served with steamed broccoli, which is served a tad crunchy which is how I like it.\n\nThe Guay Tiew Koor with an extra side of Roasted Duck was delectable as usual.  The only difference today was the wide noodles were not available per our waitress so we had instead a noodle half the size but this did not diminish the overall taste and presentation.  The fried rice noodles with chicken, fried egg, bean sprouts, ground peanuts and that amazing side of roasted duck made my taste buds swoon!  If I were dining by myself, I could order just this dish and take the other half home for another meal.  I prefer this to the Pad Thai that most folks order.\n\nSteamed Jasmine rice was both fragrant and an excellent foil for the flavors of all the dishes we enjoyed!  I can't wait to come back here again.  Too bad they don't have a south bay presence...I would eat there daily.", "rating": 5, "date": "2008-07-29"}, {"excerpts": ["Both dishes were served with tofu.

Insiders laugh at the name as it is a quintessential misnomer. West Bay natives know that this neighborhood is known for fog. Much like it's cousin Daly City, sunsets can sometimes be a rarity. Fortunately, the sunset district is also know for its family atmosphere and it's food. Placed away from  maddening crowds of tourists & just south of Golden Gate Park, the neighborhood is a haven for SF foodies. \n\nIt is no surprise that this is where Marnee Thai calls home. Located on 9th Avenue between Lincoln & Irvine streets, it's a stones throw away from many Golden Gate Park attractions. \n\nMarnee Thai is know around the city for its great Thai Food, and they have even received a honorable mention from the famous/infamous Michelin Award critics. However, being the skeptic that I am, I like to let the food do the talking. Fortunately I had the pleasure of going to this restaurant with a large group of friends, and I was able to try a number of dishes. \n\nLet me digress. There are certain restaurants that are good to experience in groups. Marnee Thai is one of these restaurants for two reasons. \n\nThe first is the ability to eat in a family style setting let's you sample a lot more of the menu than you would if it were just two of you. Second, if you go in a large group, you have to request the back room. The restaurant is divided into essentially two dining rooms; the larger front room, and the back room. Though this may not bode well for people who need to be \"seen\", the back room is a more intimate setting for a large group and I think it gives you an insider feel as you walk past those in the front. How is that for reverse psychology? \n\nBack to the food. I started things out with their corn fritter appetizer. This was something that I have never seen in a Thai restaurant. This corn based dough fritter is served with traditional Thai vegetables. Simply put, its corn & its deep fried, its good! \n\nNext came the noodles. Samplings included Pad Thai  & Pad Se Lew. Both dishes were served with tofu. While I found the Pad Thai to be very flavorful, the Pad Se Lew was lacking. Overall the noodle dishes are not bad, but this really isn't their strong point. Though they are not bad by any stretch of the imagination, I've had better. For pan fried Thai noodles I would still recommend the aptly named King of Thai Noodle House in San Francisco's Richmond district.\n\nWhere Marnee Thai really  excels is in their curries. Here is where you begin to understand why they are so popular. I ordered the Green Pumpkin Curry with tofu.  This dish was presented well and looks very appetizing. I'm a big fan of spice and they definitely hit the mark on this. The dish had a stout kick to it! The spice didn't overwhelm the dish or destroy the flavor; it enhanced it as it should. Not to worry though, all their curries can be tuned down with no sacrifice to flavor for those who don't like so much spice. All things aside, this is one of the best curry dishes that I've had to date.\n\nOther samplings included their red chicken curry as well as another yellow vegetable curry. All underscored their masterful ability to balance spice & curry into dishes that  would cure the worse case of Thai homesickness. \n\nThis overall was a wonderful experience and I definitely can say that I'm a fan. If you are in the city, planning a trip to Golden Gate Park, or someone who doesn't mind driving for food, give Marnee Thai a try. You'll uncover great Thai food in one of San Francisco's finest neighborhoods.", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-06-28"}, {"excerpts": ["We also shared the crispy tofu. ", "OMG. ", "It was delicious.

When they don't have this, I get their other fish--BASA FILLET ................................................................................................................................12.50\n  ....Basa fillet pan-seared topped with you choice of sauce\n  ....* Pork, ginger, mushrooms and onions\n  ....* Spicy mushroom and Thai herb in curry sauce. (with coconut milk)\n  ....* Fresh garlic and black pepper sauce\n\nIt's really good.  Its the closest thing they have to the 3-flavored fish in other restaurants.\n\nMy 3rd favorite is their Pad Kee Mao.  Their spicy noodle sauce is sooo good.  It's not dry, instead, it's very flavorful!  I absolutely love it.  \n\nMarnee Thai is so good that we always order it for catering for UCSF school events.  \n\nYou can't really go wrong with anything at Marnee Thai!!

This was delicious! The tofu was so crisp and a bit chewy on the outside, with the sweet sauce completely coating each piece with a burst of flavor in each bite. The flavor is quite intense and the crispy basil adds a nice lightness and aroma. Highly recommended!\n\nThen, spicy ma kuer - sauteed eggplant with mushroom, fried tofu, baby corn, bell pepper, chili, garlic and Thai basil. I love eggplant so I enjoyed this, although the flavor wasn't as bright and satisfying as that of the tofu appetizer. The eggplant was very well cooked though, with the perfect soft texture, but not too mushy and falling apart.\n\nWe also got the pad se - ew with chicken - fried rice noodles with soy bean, broccoli and egg. I thought the flavor could have been taken up a notch on this. I would have also liked to see slightly thicker, chewier noodles that were slightly more charred, or with a more intense sauce coating it. The chicken could have been more juicy and tender as well.\n\nFinally, we got the roasted duck - roasted boneless duck on a bed of spinach with homemade special sauce. The duck was very tender and juicy, although with a thick layer of fat and soggy skin on top which was not appetizing. The duck itself had a strong duck flavor, which sounds strange as it seems duck should have duck flavor. However, this duck had it in a slightly unappetizing, game-y, not so fresh kind of way.

One of the tables next to us was given food and had it taken away just before they ate it because it was for another table.\n\nHowever the food was very good. I'm vegan so I ordered the jasmine rice with praram phak. This consists of assorted fresh vegetables like cauliflower or broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn and fried tofu with peanut curry sauce (with coconut milk). It was delicious. The peanut curry sauce tasted very good.\n\nWhen I ordered I specifically asked that no oyster sauce and no fish sauce be included in my order and the waitress said it was vegetarian so it didn't include it and not to worry but I'm skeptical because one of the items in their vegetarian menu section says it is made of oyster sauce in the description. I hoped mine didn't have any and thought the chances were good since it wasn't included in this items description and the waitress said it was fine.\n\nI would recommend for the food but warn you not to come at a busy time.

The weather was perfect in San Francisco today ~ sunny with a slight breeze.  We found parking on 9th Avenue, just a few cars up from the restaurant.\n\nWe missed out on the lunch crowd and looked forward to a nice meal together.  Our friendly waitress took our order of the following: Spicy Angel Wings, Panang Beef, Guay Tiew Koor with an extra serving of Roasted Duck plus Jasmine steamed rice.  Iced water for all and a Thai iced tea for me!\n\nI had never had their Spicy Angel Wings and they certainly did not disappoint me.  The chicken wings and drummettes were sauteed in a garlic-chili sauce, then deep fried with crispy basil set atop this finger licking sweet and spicy dish!  I like my food spicy so I will ask them to make it spicier next time.  As an option, you can ask for deep fried spicy tofu instead of the chicken wings/drummettes combo.\n\nChunks of tender beef with panang curry paste, coconut milk and Thai basils make one of our favorite main courses called Panang Beef.  We had the lunch portion which is half the size of what you receive for dinner. Both the lunch and dinner portions are served with steamed broccoli, which is served a tad crunchy which is how I like it.\n\nThe Guay Tiew Koor with an extra side of Roasted Duck was delectable as usual.  The only difference today was the wide noodles were not available per our waitress so we had instead a noodle half the size but this did not diminish the overall taste and presentation.  The fried rice noodles with chicken, fried egg, bean sprouts, ground peanuts and that amazing side of roasted duck made my taste buds swoon!  If I were dining by myself, I could order just this dish and take the other half home for another meal.  I prefer this to the Pad Thai that most folks order.\n\nSteamed Jasmine rice was both fragrant and an excellent foil for the flavors of all the dishes we enjoyed!

Don't forget to pair it with the sweet-n-sour cucumber salad that comes with it, adds an extra dimension of flavor.\n\nFor the main courses, we ordered a pad Thai, the duck in red curry, and the gai samoon prai (saut\u00e9ed sliced chicken with onions & lemongrass, wild ginger, peppercorns and Thai basil). The pad Thai was a bit on the sour side and not quite to my taste, although the rice noodles were perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The curry and sauteed chicken were just OK, nothing all that different from every other Thai restaurant that I've been to.\n\nThe food here is good, but simply did not live up to my expectations. I somewhat hoped for a more exotic menu than the run of the mill Thai places. I didn't save room for dessert, but looks like that's where a lot of the stand out items were, especially the sweet roti.

A light, red-flecked broth with white chicken meat, straw mushrooms, a few slivers of tender galangal (a nice surprise), and lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves for flavor.\n\nWe then had hau mok (on the special menu), a steamed 'casserole' of tender white fish fillet layered over cabbage, and embedded in a mousse of red-curry-flavored coconut milk.  All topped with a soft, custardy egg.  It makes a good comfort food and I enjoyed the texture, but at the same time, I wish it had a little more flavor \"oomph\".  I relied a bit on the kruang prung (four flavors of condiments you can ask for, to add spicy and salty tones to your food) for this.  My dining companion noted that it was \"okay, but grew on you\".\n\nLastly, and the best dish in our opinion, was chan pad poo, a thin rice noodle dish with an chili garlic sauce that was perfectly balanced in spicy, savory, tangy, and sweet tones, and studded with crab (real crab, I'm guessing the canned variety for convenience).

This year, I resolve to write my reviews as soon as I can.\n\nIf you have ever read my previous reviews of Thai restaurants you will know that the Boyfriend does not like Thai food.  So imagine my surprise when he asked to have it for dinner.\n\nWe started out with the Avocado salad which is pricey given it only had 3 prawns.  I couldn't taste the fried shallots or the toasted coconut but I did like the spicy dressing.  We then went on to the Hung Lay curry.  This is the only curry that didn't have coconut milk.  The pork belly was really tender & the curry was flavorful.  I know many people hate pineapple in savory dishes but the pineapple chunks in this dish were delicious as it soaked up the flavor of the curry.  In fact, i tis the pineapple that got the Boyfriend craving Thai food (we've had it once before).  We also had a Pad phed with chicken which was really spicy.  We finished with a Roti with coconut ice cream which was divine.  The ice cream was not too sweet, super creamy, & had chunks of coconut meat inside.  I really enjoyed the hot/cold sensation.\n\nFor whatever reason, it seems this location is more expensive than the Irving one.  Has anyone else noticed this?

We happened to be in the Sunset and I remember from YEARS (at least 15) ago that I went to Marnee Thai.  We were nearby, found parking... this could be a bit difficult. \n\nWhen you enter thru the doors, you are immediately hit with the fragrance of cooked Jasmine Rice....sooooo yummy.  We were greeted warmly and seated immediately...HINT....get there around 6ish (this was Thursday night).  Line starts forming around 6:30 - 7ish.\n\nThe only negative....they brought cold water to the table, after taking our orders...my wife asked for hot water (cold night outside)...the brought her the hot water, but took away the cold water....kind of strange there.\n\nThe waiter was really friendly and helpful.\n\nAngle Wings (Appetizer) $7.95\nThe wings were of deep fried, no batter, this made the wings really crispy without being heavy.  It was then smothered in a chili sauce.  We ordered it mild, but that was bit too spicy for the child.  The wings were meaty and juicy...just watch out, wait till they cool a bit before biting in...first hand experience here.\n\nAvocado Salad with Soft Shell Crab $12.95\nThe salad consisted of thinly sliced avocado strings (young fruit) over a bed of lettuce with fried soft shell crab sitting on top.  The vinaigrette was both sweet and tangy...this was a really good dish.\n\nMango Fried Rice with Duck $11.95\nThis was on the daily special menu, you can also order with chicken or beef or prawns...but I like slight gaminess of duck that seem to lend itself to sweet fruits like mango.  Most places chop up the duck or you have to actually hunt for it....here the pieces were large and generous...you can identify the individual ingredients of this dish.  This is a must order dish if you like to duck or want to try it.\n\nOK - 3 people...1 salad, 1 appetizer, 1 main course...still hungry?  We wanted to share and just try a sampling without going over board...this actually held us over pretty well...we had to save room for DESSERT!!\n\nSticky Rice with Mango $5.50\nThe rice was cooked in either cane sugar or another sweetener...yummy!!  The mangos were not mushy and was a good contrast to the rice.  Need to eat this right away, do not give the rice a chance to sit around too long.  The rice was warm, if it got a bit colder, the kernels become a bit toothy.\n\nSticky Black Rice with Coconut Ice Cream $5.25\nTrust me!! If you like to try a dessert out of the ordinary...this is the dish for you.  The rice is black (looks like wild rice), it was cooked in the same sweet concoction as the rice for the Rice and Mango dish.  For this one, if you can resist, let the ice cream melt a bit before digging in.\n\nThe Restroom:\nThey only had a single unisex room.  The room is clean and well maintained, however the waste paper basket needed to be emptied and the walls could use a new paint job though, there was some chipping towards the bottom.\n\nOverall my wife would have given this place 2 thumbs up...if she could have stopped eating the Black Rice Dessert.", "rating": 5, "date": "2012-03-09"}, {"excerpts": ["Roti with Coconut ice cream for dessert\nand Side of Rice (", "yeah..

I still think it should come with the dish, not as an extra but thats acceptable...\n\nthe service there was fantastic...until we had to wait 15 minutes for dessert and remind them 3 times....thats the only reason im taking off a star....I think thats kinda rare at this place since the waiters are very attentative, maybe they just had too much to do...but still....15 mins....=/\n\noh! before i forget, the bathroom review: 4/5. \nThey play music in the bathroom! COoL! but the door is kinda weird, it shorta shakes on its own lol \n\nOverall, the food here is DELICIOUS the service is GOOD\nand worth it. \n\nI ll be sure to come back but i do hope that i dont have to wait 15 mins for my black sticky rice with coconut ice cream which....I seriously thought was vanilla for a while....\n\nanyhow. yea, it was good.", "rating": 4, "date": "2008-07-01"}], "mango with sticky rice seasonal": [], "hot coffee  hot tea": [], "thai ice coffee": [{"excerpts": ["I even tried the Thai Ice Coffee and omg... that was amazing.

The blossoms and shrimp were cooked so the salad was slightly warm.  If you never ate banana blossoms, it's good to know that the cooked blossoms have a texture similar to artichoke hearts.  It was mixed with a delicious savory sauce.\n\nPad Thai:  It was similar to the Pad Thai I got on the streets of Bangkok.  This can be both good and bad depending on your view.  It is very simple yet tasty.  Some Thai restaurants will spruce it up by adding nicely saut\u00e9ed prawns and toasty tofu but not here.  There is no sear to this dish.  Once again, like the street food.\n\nFried pork belly:  They offer 3 sauces to choose from so we chose the basic chili/garlic sauce.  It was very good.  It is essentially a roast pork topped with a sauce.  The skin was crispy but the meat was a little dry. Fortunately the layers of fat complemented the meat well.\n\nThai ice tea:  unfortunately it was very weak in tea flavor (even though we asked for less cream) and super sweet.\n\nFried banana & honey:  it was good tasting but the portion was tiny.  They quartered a banana and fried two quarters, which is one order.\n\nThe service is a bit lacking but the staff was nice.

"], "author": "mimi c.", "review": "My husband and I decided to go to the 9th street location for dinner. We  did not get good service on prior visits and decided to give it another chance due to current reviews.\n\nPros:\nOverall service was good. We had reservations so the hostess got us seated immediately over 8 people that were there before our arrival. Server was sincere and professional while taking our order and we did not feel rushed. Water was refilled several times.  We felt they were all very attentive considering how busy the restaurant was that night,\n\nCons:\n1.Based on all the good reviews, we ordered the chicken wing appetizers. I would not order this again because it tasted like it had been sitting out reheated with a glob of sauce. Chicken was not that tender or fresh and I have had better wings.....especially at San Tung (those are  amazing)!!!!\n\n2. Entrees ordered were the Sea Bass and  a type of Coconut noodles (tasted like Pad Thai) and was not what we expected. We were surprised the sea bass tasted so oily and not with a lot of flavor inside. They did not over the fish but just was not season well for my taste. Instead it had globs of fried garlic over it. I LOVE garlic but it was so overcooked it was hard and tasted a bit burnt. The garlic definitely tasted like it had also been sitting out and was recooked. The  bok choy that came with the fish was stringy.  The coconut noodles were not what we expected....nothing that alerted our taste buds to be excited . Flavor was just OK and would not order again. \n\n3. Thai ice tea....it was ok. I have had better tasting ones where you can really taste the tea and the milk. \n\n4. Leaving the restaurant was the final disappointment. The kitchen is located in front so as you walk out you can smell that awful smell of lingering overcooked oil in the air. \n\nPersonally for us, we wouldn't mind the crowd if the food was well prepared and fresh. I would have preferred to eat at Park Chow, Ebisu, Hotei, San Tung, Yummy Yummy, Pasquale's, or even Perilla if we were in that general area.", "rating": 2, "date": "2013-02-15"}, {"excerpts": ["The only thing I wish they would do is provide complimentary re-fills on the thai ice tea, because, well I love thai ice tea ", "and they only provide a tall glass cup full of ice, which doesnt leave alot of room for the tea.

Everything from the starters, to Pad Thai, and the specials are well-prepared and with just the right portions.  This place gets packed during dinner time and you may have to wait a bit once the clock strikes 6pm - a testament to how good the food is.  Also, the one on 9th street has a very limited amount of seating, another reason why it fills quickly.\n\nI normally have the papaya salad to start off with, then the chicken with basil and peppers, and pad thai - the pad thai here is awesome!

My mom used to say that I used to fiend for the Angel Wings. I'm not sure why we stopped going.\n\nAnyways I hit up the one in 9nth incarnation recently. Wow it has changed. It used to be a really old mom and pop almost a dive type of restaurant. They've updated the furniture and decorations, but not overly so. I hate it when a place redecorates in attempt to look modern and it ends up being a pretentious & garish disaster. That didn't happen here.\n\nAnyways here was the hit list: Chilean Sea Bass, Angel Wings, Vegetarian Pad Thai, and Mango Crab Fried Rice. The dessert was Rotti with Coconut.\n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass was awesome! It had a flaky and mildy spiced exterior. Their was a hint of a Chili flavor in their that was nicely paired with the texture of the bass. The interior was succulent and juicy. What a flavorful fish! It was paired with some bok choy. The Chilean Sea Bass is a seasonal item. The waiter informed me that it was only available in the winter months.\n\nThe Angel Wings were good. Not as good as I remembered them, but I think that's because my palette has matured. A neat little tasty treat is to pour the sauce of the Angel Wings on to the rice. It's really delicious.\n\nThe Pad Thai and the Fried Rice were also great, but the Sea Bass really stole the show.\n\nThe Thai Ice tea was great! The tea was the perfect strength for me and the milk was added just right. Also it was lightly iced so the tea didn't taste diluted later.\n\nThe Rotti with Coconut Ice cream was a pleasant surprise as well. I learned that Rotti is a kind of fritter mixed with sugar and butter. It had a crispy exterior and a fluffy interior. Like all fried foods it is a great contrast to the ice cream.
