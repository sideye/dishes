Things are adapted, things are changed. Classics will always be classics, but the future deserves an ode too? \n\nNow, I read through some of the reviews before I stepped in and a lot of Yelpers were going back and forth on the price vs the thickness on the stacks of meat on their sandwiches. \n\nNow, I can tell you, I love a fist thick meat sandwich as much as the next Jew. I mean really. I am Jewish and I grew up with our father taking us to one or two particular restaurants in Rockville and Wheaton solely because of the thickness of their sandwiches. \n\nBut, in this new day and age of health, we can probably both admit that no one really needs to eat one sandwich with three quarters of a pound of corned beef on it. Imagine how much meat would be in our deli drawers at home if that was a normal thing. \n\nNow, the deli near me in Bethesda does that, we all love it, but everyone ends up taking the second half of their sandwich home. Not a bad thing, I mean, you get 2 meals for the price of 1; but ya don't REALLY need a sandwich that thick. \n\nNow, I will admit that I was a little nonplussed to see the amount of pastrami on the club sandwich I got. \n\nWhen it hit the table, I literally thought they had accidentally made the club sandwich with bacon because I saw 1 singular piece of thin brownish reddish meat sticking out of the side. \n\nThen I was like... wait... I'm in a Jewish Deli... there shouldn't even BE bacon #SheDoesn'tEvenGoHere. What do we say to the G-d of Bacon in a Jewish Deli... Not Today. \n\nIt WAS pastrami.\n\nAnd then I went back to the menu... just to remind myself what I ordered, and it seems that they're making a play on a traditional club sandwich. \n\nThey say \"Smoked diestel turkey, crispy pastrami\" etc.\n\nLike the pastrami is suppose to be a substitute for bacon \n\n... clever... \n\n#ButHeresTheCatch... even on my Club Sandwich... I like more than one piece of bacon. Gimme gimme more.\n\nThe horseradish mayo is an absolute delight. Not too pungent, the mayo has a keen sweetness to it before it delivers a faint background of that unique horseradish spice. \n\nThe potato salad that I got with my sandwich was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. Not overladen with mayo, wonderful forward notes of dill. A real expert fine chop on the red onion and herbs. Really fresh and clean tasting. I'd love to get this recipe. \n\nAnd the last thing I ordered: The Pickle Plate. You can add a pickle plate onto any one of the sandwiches for an extra 4.50. \n\nIt comes with: \n\nPickeled carrots: Not a fan *strong taste of... tumeric?\nPickeled beets: Huge fan! Probably my favorite thing on the plate\nSaurkraut: A solid fresh version that has a great toothsome bite \nRed Onion: Nah B *strong taste of... Anise... I'm sure of that one\nHalf Sour spears: I'm so so on this one. Not bad, but not great. \nPickle rounds: Mustard seed? Something too strong is happening with this one as well.\n\nIf it was me, I'd let the vinegar sing a bit more than they tried to do with the spices. \n\nSo... will I be back. Well, I'll tell you for 23.70 in San Francisco I was wonderfully stuffed. It was very quick, the service was good, and mustard gave me a compliment as soon as I sat down. \n\nNo for reals... all the tables have a squirt bottle of spicy mustard that reads \n\"Eat Something, You Look Skinny\" on the back. \n\nI will be back. I still need to try the Matzo Ball soup, the corned beef, and the smoked trout salad. That was probably the hardest thing not to order, cause whitefish salad is MY JAM. \n\nLike... I don't think I've met anyone that enjoys whitefish salad as much as I do. Little secret: it'll actually be the name of my next I phone\n\nOh... and they serve all their sandwiches on enamelware!

The space is gorgeous--warm brick wall, tons of natural light. The only thing I didn't understand aesthetically were the nails pounded into the surface of the tables. What image are they supposed to conjur? They would wreck anyone wearing a delicate fabric and looked painful, but would definitely keep pens from rolling off the table.\n\nI arrived at 12:45 and she had ordered for us after twenty minutes in line. Thirty minutes later our food arrived. I don't understand the American thing about not enough people behind the counter. I understand it was during their lunch rush, but a good business hires enough people to keep the line and and the food moving. My friend ordered the vegan reuben, which looked like a traditional cafeteria-style reuben (albeit short--nothing like Katz's) and came with a heap of potato salad. The faux meat tasted of liquid smoke and the potato salad was more salad than potato. But that wasn't the worst of it: I ordered the chinese chicken salad ($9.50) and what arrived was a heap of paper-dry slaw with three crispy things on top and a slice of rye bread. Huh? Where's the chicken? I dug down to the bottom of the bowl and there were three grey, sad pieces of chicken that looked like fingernails. At this point, I was starving, but reluctantly brought it to our server's attention. I asked for something else: a turkey sandwich. \n\nAt this point, the rush had dwindled, so as I waited for the sandwich, I went up to the counter to order espresso drinks. The person at the register told me the espresso machine was broken. (I could see it, sitting there, at the end of the prep line--no note taped to it.) Huh? A cafe with a huge sign advertising espresso?!! I got the impression that they weren't telling me the truth. At this point, with a pounding headache, I ordered two house coffees, which were served to me in paper cups and were $2.50 each. So disappointing. (There is apparently a window that serves to the outside--not sure which orders take priority when both the inside restaurant and the walkup window are ordering.)\n\nThe turkey sandwich arrived in ten minutes (whoa, that was fast!). It was so sad! The sliced turkey had that chemical preservative taste and was pressed next to a very pale piece of lettuce on that same sad light rye bread. I've had better meals in a hospital. The best thing about the sandwich was the dab of mustard. It came with pickle spears (one was crisp, the other two soggy) and guess what? Cole slaw. The same slaw as the chicken salad but with sauce. I was starving but the sandwich was really unpleasant. To the deli's credit, they brought us a free bowl of matso ball soup and apologized, which was a nice gesture. The soup, however, was luke warm, which defeats the purpose of soup, and at the bottom of the bowl were more sad, dry grey shards of chicken. Ew! I ended up eating the carrots out of the soup and a few bites of the sandwich. Left disappointed and hungry. The most discomforting \"comfort food\" I've ever had.\n\nBy the time we left the place, the inside had emptied out and it looked like they closed early. It's a bus-your-own-table joint, but we saw several patrons leave who didn't get the message. I don't mind bussing my own table--the compost bin got a lot of food off my plates.\n\nThe worst part about this restaurant is that with its location and cuisine, it could and should be absolutely fabulous. It should be the gem of the neighborhood.\n\nMy idea of a delicious salad is served only a block (443 feet) away at The Grove Yerba Buena (690 Mission Street). Their chinese chicken salad is $10.75 ($1.25 more than Wise Sons). When you order a salad there that claims to have chicken in it, you see the chicken proudly piled on top, in a generous amount. The quality of their ingredients is far superior and at a comparable price point. Yes, they get busy, too, but their ordering line moves smoothly and they bring the food out in a much more timely fashion.\n\nI'm not sure what's so wise about Wise Sons.

No line and no wait, my order was ready in under 10 minutes.\n\nI've never been to New York, but when I think of the Jewish deli's you see in the movies, I envision a local corner shop where someone's granny is in the kitchen whipping up the family secret ingredients. Meats that are so tender they dissolve in one bite, potatoes so fluffy they could almost be whipped cream. Well, Wise Sons is that place. \n\nI figured going with the Reuben would be the most optimal item on the menu to get the full experience of what they're all about. I picked a winner! The meat is just the right saltiness. The Sauerkraut has the perfect blend of tanginess and texture, safe from vinegary and limp. No mushy sauerkraut here. I'm not even a fan of Rye bread but their organic fresh baked bread was so buttery and toasted precisely at the ideal level of soft and crisp that I even ate the crust!\n\nGooey, melted, thick cheese, russian dressing, and sauerkraut are layered on each slice of bread.

Things are adapted, things are changed. Classics will always be classics, but the future deserves an ode too? \n\nNow, I read through some of the reviews before I stepped in and a lot of Yelpers were going back and forth on the price vs the thickness on the stacks of meat on their sandwiches. \n\nNow, I can tell you, I love a fist thick meat sandwich as much as the next Jew. I mean really. I am Jewish and I grew up with our father taking us to one or two particular restaurants in Rockville and Wheaton solely because of the thickness of their sandwiches. \n\nBut, in this new day and age of health, we can probably both admit that no one really needs to eat one sandwich with three quarters of a pound of corned beef on it. Imagine how much meat would be in our deli drawers at home if that was a normal thing. \n\nNow, the deli near me in Bethesda does that, we all love it, but everyone ends up taking the second half of their sandwich home. Not a bad thing, I mean, you get 2 meals for the price of 1; but ya don't REALLY need a sandwich that thick. \n\nNow, I will admit that I was a little nonplussed to see the amount of pastrami on the club sandwich I got. \n\nWhen it hit the table, I literally thought they had accidentally made the club sandwich with bacon because I saw 1 singular piece of thin brownish reddish meat sticking out of the side. \n\nThen I was like... wait... I'm in a Jewish Deli... there shouldn't even BE bacon #SheDoesn'tEvenGoHere. What do we say to the G-d of Bacon in a Jewish Deli... Not Today. \n\nIt WAS pastrami.\n\nAnd then I went back to the menu... just to remind myself what I ordered, and it seems that they're making a play on a traditional club sandwich. \n\nThey say \"Smoked diestel turkey, crispy pastrami\" etc.\n\nLike the pastrami is suppose to be a substitute for bacon \n\n... clever... \n\n#ButHeresTheCatch... even on my Club Sandwich... I like more than one piece of bacon. Gimme gimme more.\n\nThe horseradish mayo is an absolute delight. Not too pungent, the mayo has a keen sweetness to it before it delivers a faint background of that unique horseradish spice. \n\nThe potato salad that I got with my sandwich was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. Not overladen with mayo, wonderful forward notes of dill. A real expert fine chop on the red onion and herbs. Really fresh and clean tasting. I'd love to get this recipe. \n\nAnd the last thing I ordered: The Pickle Plate. You can add a pickle plate onto any one of the sandwiches for an extra 4.50. \n\nIt comes with: \n\nPickeled carrots: Not a fan *strong taste of... tumeric?\nPickeled beets: Huge fan! Probably my favorite thing on the plate\nSaurkraut: A solid fresh version that has a great toothsome bite \nRed Onion: Nah B *strong taste of... Anise... I'm sure of that one\nHalf Sour spears: I'm so so on this one. Not bad, but not great. \nPickle rounds: Mustard seed? Something too strong is happening with this one as well.\n\nIf it was me, I'd let the vinegar sing a bit more than they tried to do with the spices. \n\nSo... will I be back. Well, I'll tell you for 23.70 in San Francisco I was wonderfully stuffed. It was very quick, the service was good, and mustard gave me a compliment as soon as I sat down. \n\nNo for reals... all the tables have a squirt bottle of spicy mustard that reads \n\"Eat Something, You Look Skinny\" on the back. \n\nI will be back. I still need to try the Matzo Ball soup, the corned beef, and the smoked trout salad. That was probably the hardest thing not to order, cause whitefish salad is MY JAM. \n\nLike... I don't think I've met anyone that enjoys whitefish salad as much as I do. Little secret: it'll actually be the name of my next I phone\n\nOh... and they serve all their sandwiches on enamelware!

"], "author": "Mike B.", "review": "Much like the contemporary Jewish Museum that it sits in, Wise Son's Jewish Delicatessen seems a bit more of a new age perspective on classic Jewish Deli fare. \n\nA mushroom reuben? \nA kale Caesar? \nA smoked trout salad (their version of whitefish salad)? \n\nAll things that you wouldn't dare find in the black and white tiled deli giants that call New York City home; but so is life right? Things are adapted, things are changed. Classics will always be classics, but the future deserves an ode too? \n\nNow, I read through some of the reviews before I stepped in and a lot of Yelpers were going back and forth on the price vs the thickness on the stacks of meat on their sandwiches. \n\nNow, I can tell you, I love a fist thick meat sandwich as much as the next Jew. I mean really. I am Jewish and I grew up with our father taking us to one or two particular restaurants in Rockville and Wheaton solely because of the thickness of their sandwiches. \n\nBut, in this new day and age of health, we can probably both admit that no one really needs to eat one sandwich with three quarters of a pound of corned beef on it. Imagine how much meat would be in our deli drawers at home if that was a normal thing. \n\nNow, the deli near me in Bethesda does that, we all love it, but everyone ends up taking the second half of their sandwich home. Not a bad thing, I mean, you get 2 meals for the price of 1; but ya don't REALLY need a sandwich that thick. \n\nNow, I will admit that I was a little nonplussed to see the amount of pastrami on the club sandwich I got. \n\nWhen it hit the table, I literally thought they had accidentally made the club sandwich with bacon because I saw 1 singular piece of thin brownish reddish meat sticking out of the side. \n\nThen I was like... wait... I'm in a Jewish Deli... there shouldn't even BE bacon #SheDoesn'tEvenGoHere. What do we say to the G-d of Bacon in a Jewish Deli... Not Today. \n\nIt WAS pastrami.\n\nAnd then I went back to the menu... just to remind myself what I ordered, and it seems that they're making a play on a traditional club sandwich. \n\nThey say \"Smoked diestel turkey, crispy pastrami\" etc.\n\nLike the pastrami is suppose to be a substitute for bacon \n\n... clever... \n\n#ButHeresTheCatch... even on my Club Sandwich... I like more than one piece of bacon. Gimme gimme more.\n\nThe horseradish mayo is an absolute delight. Not too pungent, the mayo has a keen sweetness to it before it delivers a faint background of that unique horseradish spice. \n\nThe potato salad that I got with my sandwich was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. Not overladen with mayo, wonderful forward notes of dill. A real expert fine chop on the red onion and herbs. Really fresh and clean tasting. I'd love to get this recipe. \n\nAnd the last thing I ordered: The Pickle Plate. You can add a pickle plate onto any one of the sandwiches for an extra 4.50. \n\nIt comes with: \n\nPickeled carrots: Not a fan *strong taste of... tumeric?\nPickeled beets: Huge fan! Probably my favorite thing on the plate\nSaurkraut: A solid fresh version that has a great toothsome bite \nRed Onion: Nah B *strong taste of... Anise... I'm sure of that one\nHalf Sour spears: I'm so so on this one. Not bad, but not great. \nPickle rounds: Mustard seed? Something too strong is happening with this one as well.\n\nIf it was me, I'd let the vinegar sing a bit more than they tried to do with the spices. \n\nSo... will I be back. Well, I'll tell you for 23.70 in San Francisco I was wonderfully stuffed. It was very quick, the service was good, and mustard gave me a compliment as soon as I sat down. \n\nNo for reals... all the tables have a squirt bottle of spicy mustard that reads \n\"Eat Something, You Look Skinny\" on the back. \n\nI will be back. I still need to try the Matzo Ball soup, the corned beef, and the smoked trout salad. That was probably the hardest thing not to order, cause whitefish salad is MY JAM. \n\nLike... I don't think I've met anyone that enjoys whitefish salad as much as I do. Little secret: it'll actually be the name of my next I phone\n\nOh... and they serve all their sandwiches on enamelware!
