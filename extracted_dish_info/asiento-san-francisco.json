They have great DJs - who will spin during the evening - and if you're looking to dance - Asiento will have you grooving in your seat - or on their decent sized dance floor.\n\nIf you're more interested in imbibing on some stellar freshly muddled cocktails and nibbling on an impressive array of delectable finger foods - Asiento has both mastered. \n\nSeriously.\n\nMy friends couldn't stop gushing about the food.

It used to be the Monkey Bar way back when, and I'd always wanted to come here for my first drink as a 21 year old. Clearly...it did not happen...as it closed before I turned 21 way back when.\n\nI checked in to get the $7 for a specialty drink, which is normally $9.50. It's kind of interesting, because evidently the businesses pay yelp for the ability to advertise a discount...so they can get more reviews and visibility? I don't mind. Its $2.5 off for me! \n\nPer usual, I get distracted by the drink name. I got The Good Idea. Which, wasn't a bad idea at all. The drinks aren't strong (I had a sip of multiple drinks), but if was ok. Nicely made, actually. There was some thought put into the specialty drinks.\n\nThe food...initially would have put me at placing this place at a solid 3 stars. Overall, it came in way too small portions (even as tapas), and the flavor was kind of meh. Of all the tapas, I'd go with the squid in sauce because the sauce is delicious. There needed to be more bread with it. No need to grill the bread, just gimmie bread for that sauce! The squid was done well, and when you cook squid in sauce, it's easy for it to be over or under cooked. Well done, chef!\n\nThe other foods were just ok. Quick summary:\n\nGuacamole: Came out pretty, but the long chips makes it hard to eat without double dipping. So if you're germ phobe, no bueno.\n\nSpinach balls: Really odd tasting. Lots of spinach, but there was something else in there making it...weird tasting. Its like a green falafal ball.\n\nThai Spring Roll: Was just a sour sauce with fresh spring roll. Nothing Thai about it. I just tasted basil and bell peppers.\n\nFried Chicken Spring Roll: DON'T GET THIS THINKING ITS FRIED CHICKEN!!! That's what we all thought and it was severely disappointing. It is a chicken spring roll that's been fried. So. Chicken Spring Roll. I think the fresh ones are considered summer rolls.  Sauce was good, food was not. Hurm...i see a trend. \n\nChicken Kabobs: Was ok. The chicken was pretty juicy, and is basically ground chicken meat on skewers. \n\nSo...what bumped me from the solid 3 up to a 4 star?? The Juicy Burger. Seriously, of all things. Juicy burger. The flavors were really great in the meat, though I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the English Muffin bun. It was made mid-rare, which...it did not look like when I first bit into it. However, on hindsight, I think the way they marinated the meat made the meat darker, because even though it LOOKED mid-well, it TASTED mid-rare. \n\nPlus, the owner is a pretty stellar person. She was very nice in talking to us (until it got busy), and wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. If I had ONE critique about the layout, I'd say that she needs more tables further away from the bar. I saw her servers having to maneuver through a very dense crowd by the bar, but there was NO one in the open space between the bar and bathrooms. I felt bad for the server, and people didn't move out of his way. Seriously, if someone is trying to get through to deliver food to another patron, you should MAKE WAY. Instead of looking over, looking down at them, and continuing talking. I'm talking to you, white group in their 40's!!

I can try a little of everything and my tastebuds will be happy from the variety. So on the often occasion that I'm eating late but don't know what to eat, I open yelp, type tapas, click Open Now, and pick one. Asiento always comes up in my search because the kitchen conveniently closes an hour before the bar closes, which is 11pm Sun-Wed and midnight Thurs-Sat. \n\n3 stars because I didn't realize this place is more of a bar than a restaurant. I was just starving and wanted to finally check this place out, but I was thrown off because there was a legit bouncer at the door checking IDs. I guess that's my bad because I didn't thoroughly sieve through photos and reviews, but I figured maybe it'll be like one of those cool gastropubs or hopefully even a nice Latin American bar w/ food.\n\nMy hopes were set too high. I got inside and it was SUPER divey. There was a live DJ but the music was like James Brown radio on Pandora. It's ironic because for a place called \"Asiento\" (Spanish for \"seat\"), it was pretty hard to find somewhere to sit. There are a few couches and bar seating, all of which were taken, so we squished with another couple to use their table because they were just chatting. \n\nHonestly I was too hungry to scramble and switch locations, so we proceeded to order. The food was decent:\n-BOCADILLOS: Sandwich w/ your choice of meat (we chose carnitas), and it was the best thing we ordered. Bread was nicely toasted and the carnitas were flavorful\n-GAMBAS: pretty much gambas al ajillo, not bad but they only give you 4 pcs of shrimp. They served it with grilled bread, but there wasn't enough white wine sauce on the plate to really soak up.\n-QUESO FUNDIDO: Cheese fondue w/ chorizo. The flavor was all there and I would have really liked this, except the cheese was not really melted into a fondue. The chips were breaking trying to scoop it so I had to eat the cheese in chunks with a fork.\n-ASSORTED CHEESE AND SALAMI PLATE: Meh! The brie was fine, but the other two cheeses were as if they went to Safeway or Target and bought a cheese platter. These were thick slices of American-like cheese, so not very appetizing to my palette. The salami and olives salvaged this dish.\n\nSpecialty cocktails were also decent but honestly just not up to par with other places that specialize in mixology. On paper, the flavors looked good. My first drink had strawberries, mezcal, and some sort of chili pepper, which my bf ordered for me because he knows that's my ish, and it was good but not amazing. For my second drink, I ordered something else that also had a spicy kick except with passionfruit and tequila... same reaction. I think the combinations are right, but the balances are off. Good drinks, just not amazing.\n\nNow on another night when I'm not specifically looking for food, I'd give this place another chance if I'm feeling like it's a low key dive bar kind of night.

I love how chill the atmosphere is, and it feels like a neighborhood joint the way people gather.   \n\nBonnie usually tends bar Tuesday night and she is awesome - really easy to talk to and makes great drinks. \n\nGoing out on a Tuesday night can be a hard sell for me, but this is a nice, relaxing atmosphere to listen to tunes, drink some beers, and eat some tacos.", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-05-10"}, {"excerpts": ["Choose the chicken bocadillos.

The prices are mid-range, the food is way above standard bar fare and the vibe is damn good.\n\nDetails Below...\n\nOne: Asiento fits this perfect middle spot between the excruciatingly expensive, trendy night spots that give that \"you're not hip or rich enough to be standing nuts to butts in here\" and the full-on, yelling-prone halls of shit-shot-and-a-beer chaos. Let me say, however, so you know where I'm coming from, that I'm the kind of guy who prefers the loud, drunk dive over the mixologist bullshit every time I'm not with a beautiful woman, which is to say almost every time. I'd normally lean towards the grungier crowd but this place is great in so many ways that I find myself here often. \n\nTwo: They have real food. One of my favorite burgers in the city is their Juicy Burger. It's small size and few ingredients are assets rather than drawbacks; the thing is just good in savory, salty and creamy (the mayo makes it) ways. The Queso Fundido is as rich and deadly as it is in Mexico, the guacamole is better than average, and their assorted tapas plates are great for sharing.\n\nThree: I've had nothing but good experiences with the staff here. From coming by myself for dinner and a drink to bringing a cadre of friends for a full night of food, drink, dancing and revelry, the bartenders and especially the owner Debi have made my experience overwhelmingly positive. Being a regular here has also translated into privileges and personal treatment (remembering my drink, foods, and even bar hopping with them after closing some nights).\n\nMiscellaneous appreciation: \n\nThey accept Debit (not Credit) cards so it's a step above cash only.\n\nHere There Be Burners - it's not central to the bar but there's a real radical inclusion feel to this place.\n\nLocal talent. Art shows on the walls / Bay Area DJs / board game and trivia location. Makes for a cool visual/auditory  environment. Less hard rock and more soul. Sometimes lighter electronic music.\n\nExtra large open windows provide a view of Bryant St and allow natural light to flood  bar during the day.\n\nDecent brunch options although it is a bar brunch not restaurant brunch with mimosas thrown on. The few times I've done brunch that's exactly what I wanted: full-bar-brunch really shakes things up. Burbon and bacon!\n\nMany vegetarian options, a gluten-free bread option.\n\nI've seen lots of events here and attended two.\n\nOne issue: Pricing is very reasonable for most items although once in a while you can feel like you're paying too much for something. Guacamole and chips for $9 is kind of steep given that you can get one of the best burgers in five neighborhoods for $8.

Also very good and although it was just as small a portion as the gambas, it wasn't as glaring because of the way it was served. \n\nMixed Sausages -- Assorted sliced sausages with a mustard dip was pretty much what it said it would be.

Quick summary:\n\nGuacamole: Came out pretty, but the long chips makes it hard to eat without double dipping. So if you're germ phobe, no bueno.\n\nSpinach balls: Really odd tasting. Lots of spinach, but there was something else in there making it...weird tasting. Its like a green falafal ball.\n\nThai Spring Roll: Was just a sour sauce with fresh spring roll. Nothing Thai about it. I just tasted basil and bell peppers.\n\nFried Chicken Spring Roll: DON'T GET THIS THINKING ITS FRIED CHICKEN!!! That's what we all thought and it was severely disappointing. It is a chicken spring roll that's been fried. So. Chicken Spring Roll. I think the fresh ones are considered summer rolls.  Sauce was good, food was not. Hurm...i see a trend. \n\nChicken Kabobs: Was ok. The chicken was pretty juicy, and is basically ground chicken meat on skewers. \n\nSo...what bumped me from the solid 3 up to a 4 star?? The Juicy Burger. Seriously, of all things. Juicy burger. The flavors were really great in the meat, though I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the English Muffin bun. It was made mid-rare, which...it did not look like when I first bit into it. However, on hindsight, I think the way they marinated the meat made the meat darker, because even though it LOOKED mid-well, it TASTED mid-rare. \n\nPlus, the owner is a pretty stellar person. She was very nice in talking to us (until it got busy), and wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. If I had ONE critique about the layout, I'd say that she needs more tables further away from the bar. I saw her servers having to maneuver through a very dense crowd by the bar, but there was NO one in the open space between the bar and bathrooms. I felt bad for the server, and people didn't move out of his way. Seriously, if someone is trying to get through to deliver food to another patron, you should MAKE WAY. Instead of looking over, looking down at them, and continuing talking. I'm talking to you, white group in their 40's!!

"], "author": "Sean K.", "review": "Asiento is my favorite non-dive bar in the Mission. The prices are mid-range, the food is way above standard bar fare and the vibe is damn good.\n\nDetails Below...\n\nOne: Asiento fits this perfect middle spot between the excruciatingly expensive, trendy night spots that give that \"you're not hip or rich enough to be standing nuts to butts in here\" and the full-on, yelling-prone halls of shit-shot-and-a-beer chaos. Let me say, however, so you know where I'm coming from, that I'm the kind of guy who prefers the loud, drunk dive over the mixologist bullshit every time I'm not with a beautiful woman, which is to say almost every time. I'd normally lean towards the grungier crowd but this place is great in so many ways that I find myself here often. \n\nTwo: They have real food. One of my favorite burgers in the city is their Juicy Burger. It's small size and few ingredients are assets rather than drawbacks; the thing is just good in savory, salty and creamy (the mayo makes it) ways. The Queso Fundido is as rich and deadly as it is in Mexico, the guacamole is better than average, and their assorted tapas plates are great for sharing.\n\nThree: I've had nothing but good experiences with the staff here. From coming by myself for dinner and a drink to bringing a cadre of friends for a full night of food, drink, dancing and revelry, the bartenders and especially the owner Debi have made my experience overwhelmingly positive. Being a regular here has also translated into privileges and personal treatment (remembering my drink, foods, and even bar hopping with them after closing some nights).\n\nMiscellaneous appreciation: \n\nThey accept Debit (not Credit) cards so it's a step above cash only.\n\nHere There Be Burners - it's not central to the bar but there's a real radical inclusion feel to this place.\n\nLocal talent. Art shows on the walls / Bay Area DJs / board game and trivia location. Makes for a cool visual/auditory  environment. Less hard rock and more soul. Sometimes lighter electronic music.\n\nExtra large open windows provide a view of Bryant St and allow natural light to flood  bar during the day.\n\nDecent brunch options although it is a bar brunch not restaurant brunch with mimosas thrown on. The few times I've done brunch that's exactly what I wanted: full-bar-brunch really shakes things up. Burbon and bacon!\n\nMany vegetarian options, a gluten-free bread option.\n\nI've seen lots of events here and attended two.\n\nOne issue: Pricing is very reasonable for most items although once in a while you can feel like you're paying too much for something. Guacamole and chips for $9 is kind of steep given that you can get one of the best burgers in five neighborhoods for $8. Once you know what the best things are you'll do great (get that damn burger and you won't care for a second). \n\nCome in and don't be shy.

Clearly...it did not happen...as it closed before I turned 21 way back when.\n\nI checked in to get the $7 for a specialty drink, which is normally $9.50. It's kind of interesting, because evidently the businesses pay yelp for the ability to advertise a discount...so they can get more reviews and visibility? I don't mind. Its $2.5 off for me! \n\nPer usual, I get distracted by the drink name. I got The Good Idea. Which, wasn't a bad idea at all. The drinks aren't strong (I had a sip of multiple drinks), but if was ok. Nicely made, actually. There was some thought put into the specialty drinks.\n\nThe food...initially would have put me at placing this place at a solid 3 stars. Overall, it came in way too small portions (even as tapas), and the flavor was kind of meh. Of all the tapas, I'd go with the squid in sauce because the sauce is delicious. There needed to be more bread with it. No need to grill the bread, just gimmie bread for that sauce! The squid was done well, and when you cook squid in sauce, it's easy for it to be over or under cooked. Well done, chef!\n\nThe other foods were just ok. Quick summary:\n\nGuacamole: Came out pretty, but the long chips makes it hard to eat without double dipping. So if you're germ phobe, no bueno.\n\nSpinach balls: Really odd tasting. Lots of spinach, but there was something else in there making it...weird tasting. Its like a green falafal ball.\n\nThai Spring Roll: Was just a sour sauce with fresh spring roll. Nothing Thai about it. I just tasted basil and bell peppers.\n\nFried Chicken Spring Roll: DON'T GET THIS THINKING ITS FRIED CHICKEN!!! That's what we all thought and it was severely disappointing. It is a chicken spring roll that's been fried. So. Chicken Spring Roll. I think the fresh ones are considered summer rolls.  Sauce was good, food was not. Hurm...i see a trend. \n\nChicken Kabobs: Was ok. The chicken was pretty juicy, and is basically ground chicken meat on skewers. \n\nSo...what bumped me from the solid 3 up to a 4 star?? The Juicy Burger. Seriously, of all things. Juicy burger. The flavors were really great in the meat, though I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the English Muffin bun. It was made mid-rare, which...it did not look like when I first bit into it. However, on hindsight, I think the way they marinated the meat made the meat darker, because even though it LOOKED mid-well, it TASTED mid-rare. \n\nPlus, the owner is a pretty stellar person. She was very nice in talking to us (until it got busy), and wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. If I had ONE critique about the layout, I'd say that she needs more tables further away from the bar. I saw her servers having to maneuver through a very dense crowd by the bar, but there was NO one in the open space between the bar and bathrooms. I felt bad for the server, and people didn't move out of his way. Seriously, if someone is trying to get through to deliver food to another patron, you should MAKE WAY. Instead of looking over, looking down at them, and continuing talking. I'm talking to you, white group in their 40's!! Maybe if there were tables on that side, people would be more likely to move over?

"], "author": "Sean K.", "review": "Asiento is my favorite non-dive bar in the Mission. The prices are mid-range, the food is way above standard bar fare and the vibe is damn good.\n\nDetails Below...\n\nOne: Asiento fits this perfect middle spot between the excruciatingly expensive, trendy night spots that give that \"you're not hip or rich enough to be standing nuts to butts in here\" and the full-on, yelling-prone halls of shit-shot-and-a-beer chaos. Let me say, however, so you know where I'm coming from, that I'm the kind of guy who prefers the loud, drunk dive over the mixologist bullshit every time I'm not with a beautiful woman, which is to say almost every time. I'd normally lean towards the grungier crowd but this place is great in so many ways that I find myself here often. \n\nTwo: They have real food. One of my favorite burgers in the city is their Juicy Burger. It's small size and few ingredients are assets rather than drawbacks; the thing is just good in savory, salty and creamy (the mayo makes it) ways. The Queso Fundido is as rich and deadly as it is in Mexico, the guacamole is better than average, and their assorted tapas plates are great for sharing.\n\nThree: I've had nothing but good experiences with the staff here. From coming by myself for dinner and a drink to bringing a cadre of friends for a full night of food, drink, dancing and revelry, the bartenders and especially the owner Debi have made my experience overwhelmingly positive. Being a regular here has also translated into privileges and personal treatment (remembering my drink, foods, and even bar hopping with them after closing some nights).\n\nMiscellaneous appreciation: \n\nThey accept Debit (not Credit) cards so it's a step above cash only.\n\nHere There Be Burners - it's not central to the bar but there's a real radical inclusion feel to this place.\n\nLocal talent. Art shows on the walls / Bay Area DJs / board game and trivia location. Makes for a cool visual/auditory  environment. Less hard rock and more soul. Sometimes lighter electronic music.\n\nExtra large open windows provide a view of Bryant St and allow natural light to flood  bar during the day.\n\nDecent brunch options although it is a bar brunch not restaurant brunch with mimosas thrown on. The few times I've done brunch that's exactly what I wanted: full-bar-brunch really shakes things up. Burbon and bacon!\n\nMany vegetarian options, a gluten-free bread option.\n\nI've seen lots of events here and attended two.\n\nOne issue: Pricing is very reasonable for most items although once in a while you can feel like you're paying too much for something. Guacamole and chips for $9 is kind of steep given that you can get one of the best burgers in five neighborhoods for $8. Once you know what the best things are you'll do great (get that damn burger and you won't care for a second). \n\nCome in and don't be shy.

I guess that's my bad because I didn't thoroughly sieve through photos and reviews, but I figured maybe it'll be like one of those cool gastropubs or hopefully even a nice Latin American bar w/ food.\n\nMy hopes were set too high. I got inside and it was SUPER divey. There was a live DJ but the music was like James Brown radio on Pandora. It's ironic because for a place called \"Asiento\" (Spanish for \"seat\"), it was pretty hard to find somewhere to sit. There are a few couches and bar seating, all of which were taken, so we squished with another couple to use their table because they were just chatting. \n\nHonestly I was too hungry to scramble and switch locations, so we proceeded to order. The food was decent:\n-BOCADILLOS: Sandwich w/ your choice of meat (we chose carnitas), and it was the best thing we ordered. Bread was nicely toasted and the carnitas were flavorful\n-GAMBAS: pretty much gambas al ajillo, not bad but they only give you 4 pcs of shrimp. They served it with grilled bread, but there wasn't enough white wine sauce on the plate to really soak up.\n-QUESO FUNDIDO: Cheese fondue w/ chorizo.

The chips were breaking trying to scoop it so I had to eat the cheese in chunks with a fork.\n-ASSORTED CHEESE AND SALAMI PLATE: Meh! The brie was fine, but the other two cheeses were as if they went to Safeway or Target and bought a cheese platter. These were thick slices of American-like cheese, so not very appetizing to my palette. The salami and olives salvaged this dish.\n\nSpecialty cocktails were also decent but honestly just not up to par with other places that specialize in mixology. On paper, the flavors looked good. My first drink had strawberries, mezcal, and some sort of chili pepper, which my bf ordered for me because he knows that's my ish, and it was good but not amazing. For my second drink, I ordered something else that also had a spicy kick except with passionfruit and tequila... same reaction. I think the combinations are right, but the balances are off. Good drinks, just not amazing.\n\nNow on another night when I'm not specifically looking for food, I'd give this place another chance if I'm feeling like it's a low key dive bar kind of night.

That is the gist of my Asiento story. \n\nThe first time I went here was for a nightcap after a long night of drinking. My friends and I were driving around and popped into the first bar we saw. It was last call and the place looked pretty depressing  -- dark, quiet, and empty except for a few stragglers at the bar. A very forgettable experience. \n\nThanks to another random nightcap a few months later, we happened on this place again, and it was a completely different experience. \n\nSubdued lighting bathed everything in a warm glow. This time, I noticed the spacious seating area, the comfortable leather chairs, and the DJ dishing out the disco. I didn't want to mix my liquors and already started the evening out with wine, so I wasn't able to sample the cocktails. What really got me was their tapas menu. Delicious!\n\nQueso Fundido with Chorizo - Traditionally served with Oaxacan cheese, Asiento's version uses five different cheeses for extra richness and flavor. It's hot, ooey gooey, cheesaliciousness mixed up with ground chorizo that comes with some chips for dipping. Sooo good. \n\nGambas -- Plump, fresh shrimp cooked up in garlic, olive oil served with slices of bread (perfect for mopping up the plate). It was really good, but I was a little disappointed that it only had four pieces of shrimp. That seemed rather stingy to me, even if it was tapas.\n\nCalamares -- The squid was really fresh and soft, cooked in a mild sauce and served with bread. Also very good and although it was just as small a portion as the gambas, it wasn't as glaring because of the way it was served. \n\nMixed Sausages -- Assorted sliced sausages with a mustard dip was pretty much what it said it would be. I'm not sure what sausages they used though.\n\nEverything we ordered was a hit. We enjoyed our drinks, the service was great, the music was great. Asiento had a fun, energetic, non-pretentious vibe that I really connected with. I'm so glad we gave this place another chance or I would have completely missed out on this awesome neighborhood spot.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-07-05"}, {"excerpts": ["Gambas, crab cakes and guacamole all received thumbs up from the table.\n\n"], "author": "Madam Y.", "review": "Stopped here for the first time w/ friends before checking out the ShEvil Dead all-girl zombie production @ Cellspace.

Gambas, crab cakes and guacamole all received thumbs up from the table.\n\nThe 5 stars over 4 stars rating is because Debbi (sp?), the proprietor of this establishment, served us and the service was memorable. FYI--there is table service when it's not so busy but when it picks up later, you should order at the bar. This place has a chill, comfortable, fun and dare I say slightly edgy ambiance. For drinks, we had the basil lemonade, bitten cherry, punch (all sort of sweet) but 5 stars for the Debbi's willingness to create a pisco sour.

The thing about serving melted cheese is that you need to start with cheese, and not rubber. Trying to dip or scoop some of this cheese onto a chip was like trying to dissect a dead animal with a bookmark. It was like taking a slice of pizza where the cheese either falls off the slice completely, or you pick up the entire pizza's cheese attached to your single slice. You get the point - the melted cheese wasn't melted.\nThe hummus, which was flavorless and chunky and which should come with more than a few tiny slivers of bread.\nThe spring rolls, which were extremely bland, served on a plate of sauce which tasted like simple syrup suspending bits of red bell pepper, which actually made the rolls taste even less flavorful.
