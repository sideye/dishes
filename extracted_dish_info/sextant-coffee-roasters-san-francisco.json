But today, I had their blueberry crumb cake, and MAN. OH. MAN. IT WAS DELICIOUS. \n\nThe cake was moist and the crumbs on top were lightly sweetened with the perfect amount of crunch to make this piece the perfect snack or meal. The blueberries were relevant with the combination but I couldn't get enough of the crumbs on top. It got a bit messy, but don't worry, that's what my plate is for! It came in a HUGE slice! And it was one of the first times I couldn't finish my piece of cake by myself...I wanted to though... I really did!\n\nOn nice days, we like to sit in their back patio and enjoy the sun under the umbrellas (seems logical to me!) and on rainy days we enjoy sitting in front of their large window. The natural lighting, wooden furnishings, and brick walls will continue bringing me back as long as I'm in the area!", "rating": 4, "date": "2014-11-19"}, {"excerpts": ["The coffee to both was simply too weak for my taste and the iced coffee was a bit sour? \n\n"], "author": "Ian C.", "review": "The place looks awesome, great place to enjoy an afternoon. Has the new typical industrial style to the place, uses daylight to lit place for the most part. Lots of space for people to hang out but most tables are just enough for 2 chit-chatters or an individual with a macbook. Also I wasn't entirely sure where to look for the menu or order my coffee. Barista was very nice.\n\nThe coffee just wasn't up to my standards and took a bit too long to make. \n\nWe tried two drinks; ICE coffee and Mocha.
