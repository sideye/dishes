I came here with my friend on a Tuesday night and we had reservations at the bar. We both got the omakase nigiri sets.\n\nFOOD: The omakase nigiri set comes with small plates, 12 pieces of nigiri, soup, and dessert. The small plates were exceptional and varied. There was a fresh persimmon salad that was inside a hollowed out persimmon, fresh tuna, croquette and other bite size appetizers. All of them were great but the main attraction was of course the nigiri. \n\nThis sushi was the best I have ever had. I was sick with the FLU and super meh feeling and this STILL tasted amazing. First, the sushi rice was actually sushi rice which is already a huge plus compared to most places. It was soft and pillowy. What was even better was that the rice wasn't just sweet but also had a bit of saltiness with it.\n\nAll of the fish was exceptionally fresh and melt in your mouth. The fish came from all over the world and were definitely higher quality. Since the chef chooses and makes each piece individually when you are ready, I ended up eating many uncommon fishes such as abalone and clam. Surprisingly, they were amazing! My favorites were the otoro and yellow tail belly but I even loved the Uni which is normally dislike! \n\nThe miso soup and dessert were fine. A great end to the meal but nothing super amazing.\n\nEXPERIENCE/ATMOSPHERE: Sitting at the counter is great because you get to see the chefs work and they are very attentive in carefully spacing out your meal. They are happy to answer any questions to have about the fish. There is plenty of time to leisurely chat with your dining partner so make sure you like each other's company!\n\nThe restaurant itself is very intimate and small which I think allows you to really get the whole experience of enjoying the preparation. However, it would not be suitable for a big party. \n\nThere were two chefs who both were Japanese. They seemed like they were trained in Japan and very passionate about making their food taste great but also look beautiful. Furthermore, the chefs were very kind and engaging!\n\nLOCATION: This place is located on clement in the Richmond. There didn't seem to be any parking issues when we went.\n\nPRICE: The particular omakase I got was $100 per person which is quite pricy. An individual piece of sushi ranged from $6-8 per piece. Therefore, this place isn't cheap. However is it worth the price? If you are just looking to stuff your face with sushi then maybe not. However, if you are looking for a complete experience with sushi quality above most restaurants, even those on Japan, then I would really recommend checking Wako out. Again I was sick and this place was still enjoyable and was the best sushi I have ever had!!! I definitely would go back again!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: I see some complaints about the size of this sushi compared to other places in japantown or Irving. Personally, I do not think this is comparable to those places. Although the pieces are smaller and more expensive, the quality is much better (and I say this as someone who loves sushi from Irving and jtown.) This sushi melts in your mouth and taste so fresh, the quality is definitely a few grades above. Also, it is authentic compared to the places I have been in Japan. Yes there are some places in Japan that have cheaper and bigger sushi like the quality in your run in the mill sushi places in sunset but there is also higher end sushi like that found in Wako. If you are willing to spend more for amazing sushi then I would really recommend trying out Wako.

I made reservations for Mother's day a couple days beforehand and was glad I did - the restaurant only has 4-5 tables and bar seating. I would have preferred sitting at the bar but they only had a 5:30 reservation for table so I took that one instead. They do take down a credit card number in case you flake - so make sure you are going to go before you make the reservation. \n\nParking in the Richmond district is always tough so make sure to come early - we were stuck in SF traffic and called to let them know we were running a bit late. The restaurant was very gracious and understood but wanted us to keep in mind that the next table seating was at 7:15.

There were five items - fried squid and tuna with caviar were my two favorite items. This dish comes out shaped like art. \n2) Sashimi plate - not super fresh... I've had better. \n3) Vegetable dish - they do have fava beans - which are a favorite of mine. \n4) Tempura - fish cake tempura, tomato, and green beans. I like fish cake...but that was about it for this dish. \n5)  Onigiri - the squid and toro onigiri taste the best. Drooooool. The others are average. They do tell you that the sauce is already drizzled on the fish so no sauce is given. Although I do like the high grade ginger they gave us. \n6) Hamachi dumplings - this was an extra dish I ordered - very average and fishy, I was expecting something else.. these were more hamachi balls rather than dumplings. \n7) I was SUPER excited for the dessert given all the reviews - they had green tea mousse w/ a blackberry on top... unfortunately I'm allergic to blackberry so I asked if there were any substitutes.. none :( The desserts were all premade. \n\nHmmm, I noticed a lot of people said they prefer Wako to Kusakabe but I liked Kusakabe a looot more and the service was much better.

(4/5)\nItems included:\n-Seaweed w/ strawberry vinagrette: tartness of the strawberry went really well w/ seaweed's oceany taste and slimy texture was fun)\n-Sesame tofu w/ wasabi (tofu had almost mochi like stickiness w/ deep bitter taste from sesame\n-Cream cheese/shiso/tomato: Japanese cream cheese so it had a nice sweetness\n-Wagyu croquette w/ red miso: Croquette ok but sauce was great.\n-Deep fried sea eel/shiso/uni butter: Uni & eel's flavors came out but needed a bit more salt\n-Sweet egg\n\nVarious nigiri courses. Loved their combos. Very unique compared to other spots I've been to. Quality fish, rice could've been a bit more flavorful. Pieces on the small side but w/ everything I was at a light fullness so I'm happy.

(3.5/5)\n\n9) Red nose amberjack w/ yuzu: Also had scallop-like texture but less oily than the striped jack\n10) Barracuda w/ ginger: Fishy taste but w/ texture of light whitefish\n11) Bonito w/ chives, daikon pulp, garlic chip: Super light piece w/ garlic flavors enveloping it. Loved it\n12) Mackerel w/ sea kelp: Had rounded sweet taste and brine from kelp cuts through the fishiness\n13) Cold Cherry Smoked salmon: Smoke brought out salmon's natural sweetness.\n\n14) Steamed mackerel w/ snaps peas, clams, spinach: Most average dish. Fish was mostly tender. Broth was good but nothing special (3/5)\n\n15) Horse hair crab w/ crab miso & ikura: Crab envelopes all your senses thanks to the crab butter. Very compact and smooth texture\n16) Hokkaido Uni \"taco\": Everything was sweet, even the seaweed.\n17) Bluefin w/ caviar & gold: Almost like melted butter. Very few tendons so it was extra smooth\n18) Sea eel w/ sansho: Leaner saltier flavors. Slightly gritty\n19) Wagyu: Extra peppery (which I love) but still has a chew. Imagine the best burger you've ever had condensed into one tiny bite. Amazing\n20) Seafood egg: Like cross between egg and and cake. Salt & sweetness both very prominent.\n21) Cherry blossom tiramisu: 1 of 2 dessert options. Wasn't a huge fan of the hard candy on top.

It had the cleanest most pure taste imaginable and sometimes was very surprising. The tuna felt richer and more fatty than I'm used to and the salmon was leaner and tougher than I expected.

Without a doubt one of the best bites was the seared scallop - so succulent and beautiful. \n\nI was a bit disappointed that the nearly $100 fixed meal didn't include the Waygu beef nigiri but we had try it and each got a piece at $12 a pop.

I came here with my friend on a Tuesday night and we had reservations at the bar. We both got the omakase nigiri sets.\n\nFOOD: The omakase nigiri set comes with small plates, 12 pieces of nigiri, soup, and dessert. The small plates were exceptional and varied. There was a fresh persimmon salad that was inside a hollowed out persimmon, fresh tuna, croquette and other bite size appetizers. All of them were great but the main attraction was of course the nigiri. \n\nThis sushi was the best I have ever had. I was sick with the FLU and super meh feeling and this STILL tasted amazing. First, the sushi rice was actually sushi rice which is already a huge plus compared to most places. It was soft and pillowy. What was even better was that the rice wasn't just sweet but also had a bit of saltiness with it.\n\nAll of the fish was exceptionally fresh and melt in your mouth. The fish came from all over the world and were definitely higher quality. Since the chef chooses and makes each piece individually when you are ready, I ended up eating many uncommon fishes such as abalone and clam. Surprisingly, they were amazing! My favorites were the otoro and yellow tail belly but I even loved the Uni which is normally dislike! \n\nThe miso soup and dessert were fine. A great end to the meal but nothing super amazing.\n\nEXPERIENCE/ATMOSPHERE: Sitting at the counter is great because you get to see the chefs work and they are very attentive in carefully spacing out your meal. They are happy to answer any questions to have about the fish. There is plenty of time to leisurely chat with your dining partner so make sure you like each other's company!\n\nThe restaurant itself is very intimate and small which I think allows you to really get the whole experience of enjoying the preparation. However, it would not be suitable for a big party. \n\nThere were two chefs who both were Japanese. They seemed like they were trained in Japan and very passionate about making their food taste great but also look beautiful. Furthermore, the chefs were very kind and engaging!\n\nLOCATION: This place is located on clement in the Richmond. There didn't seem to be any parking issues when we went.\n\nPRICE: The particular omakase I got was $100 per person which is quite pricy. An individual piece of sushi ranged from $6-8 per piece. Therefore, this place isn't cheap. However is it worth the price? If you are just looking to stuff your face with sushi then maybe not. However, if you are looking for a complete experience with sushi quality above most restaurants, even those on Japan, then I would really recommend checking Wako out. Again I was sick and this place was still enjoyable and was the best sushi I have ever had!!! I definitely would go back again!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: I see some complaints about the size of this sushi compared to other places in japantown or Irving. Personally, I do not think this is comparable to those places. Although the pieces are smaller and more expensive, the quality is much better (and I say this as someone who loves sushi from Irving and jtown.) This sushi melts in your mouth and taste so fresh, the quality is definitely a few grades above. Also, it is authentic compared to the places I have been in Japan. Yes there are some places in Japan that have cheaper and bigger sushi like the quality in your run in the mill sushi places in sunset but there is also higher end sushi like that found in Wako.

Unfortunately we were unable to reserve seats at the bar for the full experience, but nonetheless we both found Wako amazing. \n\nThe setup of the restaurant was as expected of a high-end sushi restaurant--intimate, clean, and modestly decorated. The noise level was minimal and perfect for conversation, and for a high-end restaurant, the atmosphere was not overwhelming or intimidating. \n\nWe chose the $92 9-course meal and did not get the sake pairing. Sitting away from the bar, the courses were brought out and explained by a waitress. Regarding the food, this was both our first omakase experience and it was simply amazing! The food and presentation were mind-blowing definitely exemplified the chef's creativity and skill. \n\nThe service was okay. Our food was brought out in a very timely manner, but we did have to prompt our waitress a few times for more tea as we ran out of a few times. It was also hard to hear the waitress at times (warning: courses may be inaccurate or missing details, I stopped asking her to repeat herself after the first few times).\n\nThe courses:\n1) Seaweed with vinaigrette\nRefreshing \"shot\" of seaweed to start the meal.\n\n2) Assorted appetizers\n4 small appetizers bites with very cute presentation. We really liked the eggplant and the fish skewer. The other 2 were oyster and veggies that were okay.\n\n3) Sashimi\nSmall bowl with 2 types of sashimi was perfect. Only wish we were given more sashimi!\n\n4) Potato and fish soup\nThis was my least favorite course. The fish had little pieces of bones in it that I assume was intended to be chew-able, but I personally was not a fan of the little bones. I had one bone (or fish scale?) that surprised me with the first bite. The soup still tasted great and my boyfriend had no complaints about the fish bones and loved it.\n\n5) Nigiri round 1 (4 pieces)\n6) Nigiri round 2 (4 pieces)\nWe were brought 8 pieces of chef's choice as well as presented with a menu to order additional individual pieces. They were all delicious and with great rice to fish ratio. The rice had a really good consistency and texture. Flavoring for each piece was done by the chef and generally was great. The wasabi was a little bit heavy on maybe 1 or 2 of the pieces though (on the salmon nigiri, I teared up a bit and trust me I love wasabi). \nWe also ordered the wagyu nigiri as recommended by our friend and this piece was the absolutely most delicious thing I've ever taste.

Presentation was very nice.\n\n8) Miso soup (option of red or white)\nWe both chose red miso as the waitress describe this as \"richer\". Loved it.\n\n9) Dessert (option of persimmon or strawberry lychee pudding) \nWe got one of each types of pudding.

Omakase is expensive. I really don't want to spend a lot of money on an unsatisfied Omakase experience and so I always do a lot of research before trying out Omakase from a restaurant. Based on fellow Yelpers reviews, Wako sounds like a solid choice. Went and ate, did not disappoint a single bit.\n\nMade a reservation for three for a Sunday dinner at 8:30pm. Sat down and went straight for the Omakase 7-course. (The dishes didn't come in exactly 7-course style - I guess it has to do with chef's arrangements about what to eat first, what to follow, etc)\n\n#1st course\nCherry Blossom Shrimp Seaweed Salad, plus some small fish/scallop: A.\nOne main reason I am giving it an A for these slightly ordinary dishes is due to the fact that the presentation was super nice. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hf2ofAbVdZ0F6soFHvXKtw&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw) Especially that small pea plus scallop ball thing... very cute and you can tell how much time the chef put into making this omakase a perfect experience. The choices of those ingredients made this course a very nice start of the dinner.\n\n#2nd course\nBlue Fin Tuna and Sea Bass Sashimi: A-.\nThis was probably the best blue fin tuna I have ever had. Very fresh, and definitely tasted like some premium fish. The sea bass was very good too. These two kinds of fish are not my favorite so I might be a little biased here but even so I enjoyed the freshness a lot.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CxIYljpHTRWnInvXmHTFcQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#3rd course\nRed Snapper, Lotus Root and Braised Seaweed: A.\nThe red snapper was slightly grilled - the time and temperature must have been controlled very well, which allowed the snapper to keep its juice inside the meat while its slightly crispy on the outside. Brilliant.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KXiIVnQGP2YpV1DmunNlSQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#4th course\nTempura, Ginger Marinated Tomato, and Green Tea Soba etc: A.\nAnother presentation-win here. Those little tempura pieces were perfectly fried. Green Tea Soba was very refreshing after the grilled red snapper dish, and matched the tempura super well.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7YDvrNnKM1goSEPYULHjAw&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#5th course\nMackerel and Amber Jack nigiri: A.\nI never knew raw mackerel tastes that good!

The tuna belly was super, SUPER good. Completely feeling the fat. Snow crab was handled very nicely - didn't have the sea salt water taste whatsoever but with heavy, HEAVT crab smell and taste to it.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2SN8vfWMUkYXiNKPThjJGw&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#10th course\nRed Miso Soup: A-.\nPretty good. One of the friends got regular miso and he tried ours, and said he regretted not getting red type instead. It's got a pretty unique flavor in it in a good way.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RKCUJUmJ1GVz1Pb__g6BjA&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#11th course\nAlmond Ginger dessert: A.\nEven the dessert received tons of attention! Looks like a 6-star hotel high-tea dessert, this almond ginger pudding-sort-of dish was a nice way to close the dinner. Heavy almond and ginger taste. With all the kiwi and berries added, very enjoyable.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=K0hc8lccRf35Naw94YmGaQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\nWith all of the above, 3 bottles of beer, and 2 bottles of sake, it came out ~$120/person out of the door.

There were five items - fried squid and tuna with caviar were my two favorite items. This dish comes out shaped like art. \n2) Sashimi plate - not super fresh... I've had better. \n3) Vegetable dish - they do have fava beans - which are a favorite of mine. \n4) Tempura - fish cake tempura, tomato, and green beans. I like fish cake...but that was about it for this dish. \n5)  Onigiri - the squid and toro onigiri taste the best. Drooooool. The others are average. They do tell you that the sauce is already drizzled on the fish so no sauce is given. Although I do like the high grade ginger they gave us. \n6) Hamachi dumplings - this was an extra dish I ordered - very average and fishy, I was expecting something else.. these were more hamachi balls rather than dumplings. \n7) I was SUPER excited for the dessert given all the reviews - they had green tea mousse w/ a blackberry on top... unfortunately I'm allergic to blackberry so I asked if there were any substitutes.. none :( The desserts were all premade. \n\nHmmm, I noticed a lot of people said they prefer Wako to Kusakabe but I liked Kusakabe a looot more and the service was much better.

I called on a Wednesday and was able to secure a reservation for 7pm that same Saturday. Never mind that I had omakase on Tuesday and already had plans to eat it again the next day. Omakase all day every day!! Or in my case, every other day. I really hope mercury poisoning is not a real issue... \n\nTomo has an air of dignified reserve about him. He's not flashy but you can tell that he knows what he is doing. It almost reminded me of Jiro and his understated dedication to his craft (To be fair, I've never actually been able to secure reservations at Jiro's any of the times I've been to Japan. This statement is made purely off of what I've seen in the documentary and from stalking the front of Jiro's restaurant, catching glimpses of him, and hoping desperately that he would invite us in). Not to say that Tomo's not funny when he wanted to be! The other sushi chef, Atsushi, was equally great, very sweet, and consistently checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. \n\nIn my opinion, Wako stands out from the other omakase places in the city for a couple of reasons: \n\n1. Interesting marinades and toppings \nExample 1: Raw abalone with ground up liver sauce \nExample 2: Cold smoked cherry salmon \nExample 3: Blue fin tuna lightly torched and then marinated in jalapano soy \n\n2. Appetizer/warm dishes are very flavorful and well-balanced. \nExample 1: Uni Chawanmushi. The egg custard was exceptionally flavorful. You can really taste the dashi stock, which in my opinion, gives it a more umami flavor and really underscores the taste of Japanese cuisine. \nExample 2: All the fried stuff (fish, potato ball with wagyu, lotus root, octopus) were lightly battered, fried, and just really well done. \n\n3. Last, but definitely not least, AMAZING desserts made by one of the waitresses. I think the desserts alone are worth coming here! We had two different types of panna cotta esque desserts (blackberry currant and green tea with white choclate) that left me speechless. \n\nWhat prevents this from being a 5 star review is because: \n1. The rice was a bit too soft and sweet \n2. The temperature on some dishes and the temperature change between dishes were very extreme.

They answered all our questions.   So allow me to describe each dish in order\n\n1)The first dish that came out had 4 small plates. which had a squid dish, sesame tofu, oyster and a warm egg.  All of it was so good and super tasty!  You can tell just how fresh everything was!  \n\n2) The second dish was the sashimi.  It was two slices of tuna and two slices of butterfish (which is my fav!)  Super fresh as well and you don't even need the soy sauce. \n\n3)Dish number 3 was a dish with pink sticky rice on the bottom and salmon baked with something i forgot on top.   The sauce that went with this made it outstanding.   you will be licking the plate of that sauce.  \n\n4)Dish number four was my #2 favorite of the night (i'll get to #1 soon).  This was a fried shrimp with green tea salt powder.   It was amazing!  I wish i had more of this.  The green tea salt powder was powerful enough to make this dish stand out.  \n\n5) The plate of nigiri came out with 8 different choices for you .   I don't remember what they all were, but i enjoyed all but 2 of it. \n\n6) For your 6th dish you have an option of the regular miso or the red miso.  My friend and i both got the red miso.   It comes out in black and red bowl so you can't even tell what color it is.  It does taste different. It's not as salty or as tofu-y (if that is even a word).  My friend described the taste as it having an herbal taste with a hint of seafood  taste\n\n7) For dessert we had the passion fruit parfait.  Super light and tasted very tropical \n\nand finally my number one favorite dish.  We ordered this in addition, to our omakase.  As egg lovers, we just had to get the tamago.   It wasn't just any tamago it was the one without rice, just the egg itself.  When it came to our table it looked like a pound cake.  When you eat it, it sure taste like a super moist pound cake.

There are three omakase menus: a nigiri sushi and sashimi exclusive one, nigiri only, and a seven course mix of these with cooked and raw small plates; we chose the latter.  \nBeing exhausted from the hectic journey here, I wasn't fully focused on itemizing our courses, given the wide variety of fish in various sashimi and nigiri form. \nHere is a summary of the various offerings in our meal:\n\nThe two specials on the menu were the striped jack (sashimi) and the golden eye snapper. \nYellow tail baked apple and scallop bites were delicious as well as the fish cake tempura, as a different take.  The nigiri offerings included salmon, scallop, and yellow tail as one course and saba, king crab, and otoro as another course.  \nWanting to explore a bit more, I added yellowtail dumplings as a supplement.\nWe were offered the option of red or white miso soup (I had the red).  \nThe dessert was not memorable except that it was topped with a chestnut.\n\nThe restaurant is not very large and the tables are pretty close together so hope you aren't shy about sharing conversations.  I tried to add the abalone as another supplement, but they had another party waiting for our table so will save it for next time.\nThe consensus from my other Yelp friends who've reviewed this place is a rousing five stars (4.5 by Cherylynn, but rounded up).\nJust don't walk in here expecting a budget dinner or, as Ken K. dubs, \"jive ass rolls\" (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DS0Idr2XDhz5e7ZfSy0dYA) or bento boxes.

Parking on Clement can be insane especially during peak dinner hours. Be prepared to circle the block multiple times as even an illegal space was hard to come by!\n\nD\u00e9cor is typically Japanese with judicious usage of modern plank-wood on the walls, wooden furnishings and a pretty sushi bar. The vibe was chic and contemporary and more importantly, giving the restaurant a clean look.\n\nAs we wanted to try a good cross section of the menu, we opted for a table.\n\nSUSHI:  Wako is high-end. I savored each piece of fish in one mouthful with slow, deliberate bites, as there would be no reruns. Breathe in the pristine freshness, relish how each piece was delicately seasoned and sauced by the chef and notice the textural difference between each fish. Close your eyes if you must lest you might be distracted! Ala Carte nigiri prices are steep. The menu prices are priced per piece, not a pair and you can spend a pretty penny in a hurry! \n\nHere's a low down of today's nigiri specials and every fish was divine!\n\n1. Hirame (Halibut $6) : a very popular white fish with light and delicate flavor.\n2. Shima Aji (Striped Jack $6) : delicious, like a cross between kanpachi (amber jack) and hamachi.\n3. Kamasu (Japanese Baracuda $6) : like hirame, it was soft, juicy and light.\n4. Kinmedai (Golden Eye Snapper $8) : its texture was not too soft or too crunchy, with a slight sweetness and not fishy.\n5. Akamutsu (Rosy Sea Bass $8) : a rare find, not to be missed! A white fish that tasted like toro! (fatty tuna).\n\nThe kitchen entrees were equally glorious with some minor hiccups. Even the soy on the table was doctored for better taste. Presentation was the essence.\n\n1. King Crab and Baby Scallop Tempura ($12), light batter and the King Crab were beyond delicious! One piece was given the \"isobe\" treatment using roasted seaweed (nori) for added flavor. (5/5)\n2. Kaisen Chawanmushi ($9 Savory Egg Custard) made with jidori eggs (from specially raised chickens but who cares?). I appreciated the uber smoothness of the custard and the snow crab. But a dollop of uni? Didn't blend so well to my liking with egg custard! (4/5)\n3. Blue Fin Tuna cheek on Hotplate (14) was just so so as I preferred my tuna raw. But this was just me! (3/5)\n4. Grilled Ink Squid Legs ($8) was nicely salted and crunchy (4/5)\n5. Simmered Golden Eye Snapper Head (9) was a delicacy although your cat would love it too! I would have preferred it to be served warmer (temp-wise) and was too sweet  for my liking. (2/5)\n6. Grilled Sanma (pike mackerel) with Matsutake mushroom was definitely a work of art! The fish was completely deboned and the mushroom and sweet ginger complemented the umami flavors. Well done! (5/5)\n\nThis is the place to come if you are a purist seeking out authenticity and traditionality. I can see careful attention was given to every detail. The server was young, very pleasant although not quite as professional as I would have expected at a high-end place like this. All in all, we had an enjoyable evening!\n\nGochisosama deshita!

They were so personable and made us laugh with their lighthearted conversations.  They introduced themselves to everyone and asked us our names.

Amidst the cockfest of douchebags and losers, there's a real gem...somewhere. If you look hard enough that is. That gem is Wako.\n\nQuietly opening on May 27th, Wako took over the old Murasaki spot and is the 4th high-end sushi restaurant to open in SF after Akiko, Maruya, and Kusakabe. Wako's opening was not published anywhere and I happen to stumble upon it on Yelp after going through 100+ of sushi listings. My friend had mentioned that Clement doesn't need another sushi restaurant. I initially agreed with her but after thinking about it, Wako is one of the few authentic, Japanese owned and operated Japanese restaurant in the area (Okina is another). \n\nHailing from Sanraku, Wako's owner and sushi chefs serve up traditional Japanese fare. On the menu are nigiri, maki rolls (no dragon or gross bukkake rolls), binsho-grilled items, and izakaya dishes. All nigiri is individually seasoned and sauced so no soy sauce or wasabi is provided. Beware that the nigiri is charge by the piece and not by the pair so your bill will quickly rack up if you order strictly nigiri. Expect to spend about a $80-$100 pp. \n\nThey have an excellent sake and beer menu. Our waitress recommended a great junmai (I forgot the name but it was $10/glass) which I guzzled down. She also recommended the best beer I've ever had (and I don't usually like beer): http://bit.ly/1xOAq1R. It was pricey at $9 a bottle but I've never seen this banana beer before. It was smooth and light with a nice, sweet banana finish. Get this!\n\nAs suggested by the sushi chef, we decided to go with the smaller omakase so we can add additional a la carte items from the menu. \n\nOmakase Option #1: Two small plates, 1 binsho-grill, 7 piece nigiri & 1 miso soup for $43 or you can do the Omakase Option #2 that adds sashimi, tempura & dessert for $68.\n\nOMAKASE OPTION #1 ($43)\n*Braised Eggplant  & Housemade Sesame Tofu: http://bit.ly/1ubIk0t\n*Gindara: Grilled Black Cod: http://bit.ly/TNYXoa\n*Nigiri: Tai, Aji, Bonito, Canadian Salmon, Uni (Hokkaido), Otoro & Anago: http://bit.ly/1xOdM9W\n*Miso Soup: http://bit.ly/1lq9n7i\n*Complimentary Matcha Dusted Chocolate Truffles: http://bit.ly/1xOjSXE\n\nThe eggplant and tofu were great subtle openers. Loved the custardy texture of the tofu. As most of you know, I despise cooked fish but the generous portion of gindara was perfectly grilled and the flesh was super silky and moist.  \n\nThe best part of the omakase (as always) was the nigiri. The progression was on-point: from light to fatty fishes. The fish was pristinely fresh and each nigiri was individually seasoned and garnished with items that best complement the fish. Our favorite was the otoro; it's like sex in your mouth!\n\nWe had a choice of housemade miso or red miso for our last course. We received one of each to share. The red miso is a lot saltier so I liked the regular miso soup better. It was a bowl of comfort with velvety cubes of tofu.\n\nThe complimentary housemade matcha dusted chocolate truffles were like crack! They need to package and sell these babies!\n\nA LA CARTE ITEMS:\n*Tempura ($12): http://bit.ly/1jmvAz9\n*Gindara Tu Nasu: Braised Miso Black Cod ($9): http://bit.ly/1s8taNT\n*Chawanmushi: Steamed Egg Custard w/ Uni ($8): http://bit.ly/1iqJEr8\n*Ankimo w/ Ponzu Gelee ($8): http://bit.ly/1pnYPcc\n*Otoro ($8/piece): http://bit.ly/1hRfcMd\n*Matcha Daifuku: Matcha Mochi w/ Red Bean Paste ($4.50): http://bit.ly/SCIQIX\n\nBecause no Japanese meal is complete without tempura in Mr. NSS' eyes, we had to get an order of tempura which was one of the best I've had. The batter was airy and super light. The gindara tu nasu was bowl of savory, umami goodness and would have been perfect with a bowl of steamed rice. I loved the silkiness of the chawanmushi but the uni was a bit too brown for my liking. \n\nBack to cold dishes, the ankimo was deliciously buttery. Not Ino-san status but still very good. I liked the nouvelle touch of the ponzu gelee. The second otoro piece was sexlicious as the first. This is a must order!\n\nDo order dessert here as everything is housemade. The matcha daifuku was bomb! It had a fantastic chewy, carblicious mochi exterior with a delicate matcha flavor and red bean filling. Lolia S. would definitely approve. \n\nThe staff is sweet, attentive, and friendly. Feel free to chat it up with the sushi chefs as they're super nice. \n\nReservations are recommended as Wako only has 10 seats at the sushi bar, five 2-tops, and one 4-top. Do sit at the sushi bar for all the nigiri making action: http://bit.ly/1ljg5fR.\n\nParking in the area sucks so it's best to come on weeknights. \n\nHaving previously lived in Inner Richmond, Wako is breath of fresh air to the plethora of pseudo Japanese restaurants in the area. *ahem Ichiraku ahem* Just be prepared for the sticker shock for the area.

The bbq eel had an a really good char on it\n- Deep fried river fish and giant clam with edamame: the giant clam was really good, but the river fish was basically fish skin, which I didn't love as much\n- Shigoku oyster with yuzu pineapple sauce: the sauce on top was really good and unique\n\nSashimi: you're first presented with a little dish with gold flakes and their house blend soy sauce, which is probably one of the best flavored soy sauces I've ever had.  The sashimi is on ice with seaweed, shredded daikon, edible flowers, a lemon, wasabi, and most importantly the fish.  We got 2 pieces of blue fin tuna (so fresh and so good) and 2 pieces of kampachi (I liked the yuzu on it).\n\nSeasonal warm dish: Grilled swordfish in the center (super tender) and this almost gravy like mushroom truffle butter sauce that was very rich without being super heavy. It was a beautiful dish with different colors and textures - shimeji mushrooms, enoji mushrooms, okra, shiso leaf, edible flowers. This was a very impressive dish that I did not expect to come from a sushi place.\n\nSeasonal tempura: I thought - how good could tempura be? Their batter (not panko) and selection of things they fried were really unique, and the green tea sea salt for dipping was awesome.  We had pike eel, brussels sprouts, a fig, and a cluster of corn kernels.

We went with the 12pc nigiri option which was a good choice since we still got a couple of hot dishes but the main focus was on the fresh fish. Some of the standouts include toro with caviar and gold flakes and tempura fig. The sushi chefs were very knowledgeable about the fish and would describe where each piece came from. Our items came from Japan, Turkey, and even locally from Santa Cruz! When presented with the wagyu beef towards the end of the meal we got to see the certificate of where it came from including the little cow's nose print, his name, and his parent's names (they showed me this after I ate it, thank goodness!).\n\nOverall this was a great experience and well worth the price. It's less pretentious than some other omakase spots and the intimate yet casual feel allows you to really enjoy the experience. We've also been to Kusakabe and Sushi Yoshizumi. I would say Wako and Kuskabe are our favorites (Wako slightly more because we like the atmosphere more) and Sushi Yoshizumi was my least favorite.", "rating": 5, "date": "2016-08-12"}, {"excerpts": ["The menu choices are 9- or 11-course Omakase (\"chef's choice\") but you are able to request additional nigiri/sashimi pieces at a la carte prices.

A lot of people have given Wako 5 full stars, but after dining there, I found that I couldn't justify a rating above 3 stars. I've been eating sushi since I was 6 years old and have experienced omakase meals in some of the some of the best Japanese restaurants around the world (Tokyo, New York, San Francisco, London, etc.) San Francisco has recently seen an explosion of high-end Japanese restaurants many of which only offer set menus ranging from $95 - $250 per person. When I saw that Wako's reviews were highly positive and their prices were less ($85 for base omakase), I anticipated a meal that was expertly prepared and good value. Unfortunately, very few of the dishes we received hit the mark. \n\nIncluded, please find an overview of our 7 courses. Although, please note that they skipped one of the courses (tempura) that is supposed to be included according to the menu, and we didn't realize it until afterward.\n\n1. Starters: Toro Tartar, Okre with Daikon, & Fig Tempura. The fig was the standout but there was nothing special about the remaining appetizers (and the okre diakon could have been skipped entirely).\n\n2. Sashimi: Incredibly poorly chosen items with terrible presentation (an unappetizing and tasteless piece of eel with small bones, an OK piece of clam, and 2 pieces of blue fin tuna). The quality of the fish was OK, but this certainly isn't the right combination to get a person's palate prepared properly and the whole dish looked like it had been thrown together.\n\n3. Warm Dish: Whole cooked fish with a green vegetable sauce and a fried fish bone on top. This was the prettiest looking dish (photo attached), but after a few bites it was incredibly boring. The flavors just weren't present.\n\n4. Tempura: We never received our tempura dish at all! There was nothing even mentioned, and since they took away our menus, I did not realize this until writing this review.\n\n5. Nigiri: This is where the restaurant shines, and perhaps if I had only been eating Nigiri, I would have also praised this restaurant. I thought the selection could have been a little more intriguing, but the rice was great and the fish was fresh and expertly cut. Honestly, if we had only had this dish, I would have be able to provide at least a 4 start rating.\n\n6. Miso Soup: We opted for the more pungent red miso. The dashi and flavor was excellent. My only complain was there was very little in the soup (only a couple tiny pieces of tofu and a small flake of fish). The broth was excellent but the distribution of the soup could use greater attention.\n\n7. Desert: The deserts were nice. One featured Matcha and the other was sweeter. They were a pleasant way to end the meal.\n\nAll in all, we were disappointed with our meal, and in retrospect are surprised we missed an entire course. The way they served the nigiri (in 2 parts) made it seem like we were receiving all 7 courses, but in retrospect after re-reading the menu, I definitely recall the Tempura course being listed on the menu and missing from our meal.

The owner and sushi chef puts so much care into everything he does, and will go into great lengths to tell you about where each ingredient comes from. I went with the seven-course omakase, which was really the best way to get a good sampling of the menu and their fish specials.\n\nThe meal starts off with a small plate that comes with three components. The plate was probably one of the most beautifully composed plates I've seen, built around the theme of autumn. First is a housemade sesame tofu with a tiny dot of wasabi on top, and the texture was a lot creamier than most tofu. Next was a roasted eggplant slice made to look like a tree stump that was covered with a delicious sauce. Finally, a piece of kombucha squash was carved into the shape of a leaf and roasted just right. All of the flavors were simple and clean, but it was the perfect way to pique my appetite.\n\nThe next course was sashimi, which was served with a bit of lemon zest that really complemented the fish. The best piece was the king salmon, generously sliced and extremely fresh. To round out the appetizers, the tempura plate was the most substantial and further showed the creativity of the chefs. The matsutake mushroom and shishito pepper tempura were relatively standard, but the mackerel was first encrusted with rice cracker and then fried in tempura batter. It gave the tender fish an amazing crunch on the outside, adding both flavor and texture. \n\nThe main grilled course was served in between the nigiri servings, and the day's special was a potato-crusted salmon with seasonal vegetables. The salmon was essentially marinated in a potato puree that really softened the fish, and then it was topped with chestnut, green bean, and carrot. The dish was somehow a complete dish all combined into one piece. \n\nThe seven pieces of nigiri is really the most unique part of the omakase, with each piece served one at a time, with wasabi and soy sauce already carefully painted onto the nigiri in order to avoid any customer drowning their fish in soy sauce and wasting the flavor. The best piece was the toro, or the fatty tuna belly. It's the most buttery piece of fish, and I loved the rice to fish ratio. They're definitely not trying to fill you up on carbs, leaving you plenty of room to really enjoy the fish. Wako has also brought upon my appreciation for uni. I've never really had good uni before this meal, and the uni nigiri with the shiso leaf tucked in between the rice was perfect. The brine-y flavor wasn't overwhelming, but I still got a great flavor of the ocean. Another highlight was the crab nigiri, which was so tender. It was a simple bite, but the perfect way to highlight the crab. \n\nThe meal is finished off with a housemade strawberry mousse, maintaining that light quality that connected the entire omakase. The fresh strawberry chunks made it refreshing, and the mousse itself wasn't at all heavy or creamy. They also serve a complimentary piece of chocolate that they also make themselves, finishing off with a bit of decadence that you didn't realize you wanted after an amazing meal. \n\nWako Sushi is without a doubt one of my favorite Japanese spots in San Francisco, and I highly recommend it to anyone, sushi lover or not!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-10-22"}, {"excerpts": ["and there isn't anything phenomenally outstanding\n\n#3: 7 Nigiri\n- Beautifully made and very tasty!

But, I certainly think Wako deserves my very first review!\n\nWhile the whole town is hyping over the opening of Kusakabe, Mr. J and I decided to try this even newer, shy of a month old joint first.  I got home around 8:30 pm on Friday night after a long streak of working weeks and was telling Mr. J that we haven't had time to really enjoy a meal together.  So, maybe we should go somewhere nice for dinner.  Mr. J was laughing at me and said no good place would have an open reservation on a Friday night.  Well, I decided it doesn't hurt to try and gave Wako a call to see if their sushi bar is available at 9 pm.  I won't lie, but I was surprised when the lady over the phone told me that they are available.  And there, Mr. J and I rushed out the door.  On the drive over there, we kept thinking if we made the right decision and will we be disappointed at the end of the night.\n\nWhen we walked into Wako, I immediately fell in love with its cozy and inviting environment.

There are 10 seats at the bar and we got the perfect front view of Tomo-san and Atsushi-san!

I won't go into too much detail of our dishes as I believe a picture is worth a thousand words.  But, there are a few things worth mentioning.\n\n*** Rice - Mr. J and I are very particular and picky when it comes to the sushi rice.  We both agreed that the sushi rice at Wako is probably the best we've had in the bay area.\n\n*** Size - Some might find their nigiri to be on the smaller side.  But, I find them to be the perfect size to be eaten with hands in one bite.\n\n*** Rhythm - Tomo-san always asks if he may start preparing the next sushi.  And, every nigiri is prepared right before served.  I really hate to compare Wako to Maruya since Mr. J and I like them both.  But, we've seen fishes been sliced together beforehand at Maruya the last time we were there at the sushi bar.\n\n*** Tamago - Not your typical tamago at the sushi restaurant here.  The type they served is Kasutera, the kind that look and taste like the Japanese Castella cake.  And, it's Mr. J's favorite!  Tomo-san asked if we had this kind of tamago before and wanted our opinion.  After I took a bite and he saw my big smile, he said no words are needed as he can see it in my smile.\n\n*** Dessert - I cannot express enough the importance of a dessert at the end of every meal.  I don't care how good of a meal I had if their dessert is weak.  A great dessert = a perfecting ending to a meal.  Mmmm, I am still drooling over their house made matcha daifuku!\n\nTomo-san and Atsushi-san are both funny and interactive.  They totally made our night a happy one!

Each piece was around $5-$8 and was as good as my other favorite Japanese restaurants.\n\nThe blueberry panna cotta was small, but had a good creamy texture, and a tart blueberry aftertaste. We enjoyed it immensely.\n\nThe service was great, and the teapots were cool. Steel, and each table had a different one.\n\nReservations strongly recommended, as we saw people getting turned away left and right.\n\nWould I come back again?\n\nDo fish need water?\n\nHell yeah!", "rating": 5, "date": "2014-09-05"}], "half shell oyster": [], "gindara to nasu oroshini": [], "hamachi tsumire no kani yuba ankake": [], "mentai dashimaki": [], "agedashi dofu": [], "kaisen chawanmushi": [{"excerpts": ["Kaisen Chawanmushi ($9 Savory Egg Custard) made with jidori eggs (from specially raised chickens but who cares?).

I guess it comes with the territory! Parking on Clement can be insane especially during peak dinner hours. Be prepared to circle the block multiple times as even an illegal space was hard to come by!\n\nD\u00e9cor is typically Japanese with judicious usage of modern plank-wood on the walls, wooden furnishings and a pretty sushi bar. The vibe was chic and contemporary and more importantly, giving the restaurant a clean look.\n\nAs we wanted to try a good cross section of the menu, we opted for a table.\n\nSUSHI:  Wako is high-end. I savored each piece of fish in one mouthful with slow, deliberate bites, as there would be no reruns. Breathe in the pristine freshness, relish how each piece was delicately seasoned and sauced by the chef and notice the textural difference between each fish. Close your eyes if you must lest you might be distracted! Ala Carte nigiri prices are steep. The menu prices are priced per piece, not a pair and you can spend a pretty penny in a hurry! \n\nHere's a low down of today's nigiri specials and every fish was divine!\n\n1. Hirame (Halibut $6) : a very popular white fish with light and delicate flavor.\n2. Shima Aji (Striped Jack $6) : delicious, like a cross between kanpachi (amber jack) and hamachi.\n3. Kamasu (Japanese Baracuda $6) : like hirame, it was soft, juicy and light.\n4. Kinmedai (Golden Eye Snapper $8) : its texture was not too soft or too crunchy, with a slight sweetness and not fishy.\n5. Akamutsu (Rosy Sea Bass $8) : a rare find, not to be missed! A white fish that tasted like toro! (fatty tuna).\n\nThe kitchen entrees were equally glorious with some minor hiccups. Even the soy on the table was doctored for better taste. Presentation was the essence.\n\n1. King Crab and Baby Scallop Tempura ($12), light batter and the King Crab were beyond delicious! One piece was given the \"isobe\" treatment using roasted seaweed (nori) for added flavor. (5/5)\n2. Kaisen Chawanmushi ($9 Savory Egg Custard) made with jidori eggs (from specially raised chickens but who cares?). I appreciated the uber smoothness of the custard and the snow crab. But a dollop of uni? Didn't blend so well to my liking with egg custard! (4/5)\n3. Blue Fin Tuna cheek on Hotplate (14) was just so so as I preferred my tuna raw. But this was just me! (3/5)\n4. Grilled Ink Squid Legs ($8) was nicely salted and crunchy (4/5)\n5. Simmered Golden Eye Snapper Head (9) was a delicacy although your cat would love it too! I would have preferred it to be served warmer (temp-wise) and was too sweet  for my liking. (2/5)\n6. Grilled Sanma (pike mackerel) with Matsutake mushroom was definitely a work of art! The fish was completely deboned and the mushroom and sweet ginger complemented the umami flavors. Well done! (5/5)\n\nThis is the place to come if you are a purist seeking out authenticity and traditionality. I can see careful attention was given to every detail. The server was young, very pleasant although not quite as professional as I would have expected at a high-end place like this. All in all, we had an enjoyable evening!\n\nGochisosama deshita!

Over the summer I was in Tokyo and basically wanted to continue my high of quality sushi. When the date finally came to have dinner here I was more than excited. Stepped into a beautiful, cozy restaurant wrapped in wood. The decor in the place was completely inviting and intimate. The place can only sit about 30 people (you must make reservations and they book up pretty fast..). I really wanted to sit at the bar but it was completely booked even with calling 2 weeks in advance. \n\nWe decided on the 7 course omakase which was comprised of  3 small bites, 1 piece of grilled fish, 7 piece nigiri, 3 small pieces of tempura, miso soup and dessert. \n\nCompletely FRESH AND SIMPLE. Nothing too intricate or bold just simply delicious quality flavors that stayed true to their ingredients. I have to say the sushi nigiri pieces are VERY SMALL; even to Japanese standards. They were probably the smallest pieces of sushi I have ever had.. Even after the 7 courses we were still hungry so we ordered the kaisen chawanmushi - a small hot pot of jidori egg curd, snow crab and uni... AGAIN absolutely delicious but soooo small!! I was still soooo hungry. After dinner  I wanted to run to Genki for a crepe! \n\nBottom line this place is OK.

Buuuuut all hype was false unfortunately. \n\nFor food, we ordered the 10 piece nigiri omakase and the kaisen chawanmushi to share. Food is mediocre at best. Average. Nothing stood out to my friend and I. Maybe just the seared scallop nigiri, but that's out of 10 pieces of nigiri and a small plate. \n\nAs for service, we never got a refill on our tea. However, I noticed that the table next to us got an entire pot of tea while we just had a small cup. No one ever stopped by to ask us if we wanted a refill. Also, once the place got busy, we barely even saw our waitress unless they were giving us our food. Even then our food came out pretty fast.\n\nOverall, our experience here was definitely lower than what we had expected. The quality of food is so-so and just average. We were hoping that Wako would prove us wrong, but instead, they proved us right that their food indeed is just average. I'm not saying Wako is bad, but there are definitely other sushi restaurants that serve better fish than here for the amount we paid here. \n\nAlso, just to give you a glimpse of how much we spent, our total bill came out to be about $153 without tip -  $85 per person plus tip.
