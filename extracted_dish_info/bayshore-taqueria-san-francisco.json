I called as I was pulling out of the parking lot of BevMo and ordered an enchilada plate and a Horchata (because yelp had a check in offer for a free Agua Fresca and you can't beat free). \n\nWhen I got there, there was no parking, so I had to create-a-spot which is an old family secret. \n\nBayshore Taqueria is really dank looking, complete with a dim lighting and hobos crack-heading around outside the front door. Mmm, so hungry. The girl at the register was extremely sweet on the phone and in person. But I was surprised to hear my total for an enchilada plate and a free drink was a whopping $14.08 and the meal does not come with chips and salsa which was a huge boner killer. \n\nWhen I got home, I came to find out that this food seriously tastes exactly like La Corneta which you might think is a good thing but there's a reason that I don't go to La Corneta and that reason is that the food tastes really oily to me and I'm just extremely sick of it after going there for 10 years. Bayshore's beans are way better than Corneta's though. But La Corneta only has one hobo out front and that guy has a great sense of humor and is far less likely to shank you so Corneta wins on that count. \n\nWould I go back to this Taqueria? Only if I were in the same situation that I found myself in tonight, where my only other option was fast food, but, honestly, in that situation I would probably just go for fast food. This place wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, I just found it to be mediocre and coupled with the fact that it's overpriced and there's ABSOLUTELY no parking.", "rating": 4, "date": "2016-02-03"}], "combination enchilada taco and tamale": [], "fajitas plate": [], "taco plate": [{"excerpts": ["I had the taco plate, one carne asada taco and one al pastor, with rice and black beans.
