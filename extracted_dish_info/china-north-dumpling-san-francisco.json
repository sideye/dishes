"], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "After reading some of these negative reviews, I think Susy C.'s review is spot on - those people just came in with the wrong expectations.  Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.  The center was pretty good too, as it was slightly chewy and not bready, and the fresh green onions helped to add a lot of great flavor.\n\n-- NAPA CABBAGE WITH PORK DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#4yE81GGRooZiWYQGK_gaFg)\nAlthough they weren't as tasty as others I've tried (still good), it was awesome how they were so packed with filling.  I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.  It was simple (pork belly, bok choy, and their house sauce), but well done.  The bits of pork were cooked perfectly (soft and tender) and I thought the sauce added a slight tartness to the dish.\n\nConsidering the three of us were able to try five things for a measly $40 (with leftovers), it's safe to say the portions at China North are both plentiful and cheap.  Which is a good thing too since between the various types of hand pulled noodle soups (particularly the spicy beef noodle soup) and all of the dumplings, there's plenty more to try!

Arriving at 5:45 pm, the place was empty as it was on the early side for dinner and only three tables were occupied including ours. There were several servers with one hand preparing the pot stickers  two tables away from us. I literally had to do jumping jacks to get someone's attention letting them know we were ready to order.\n\nWith that being said and our order placed, our server came back with a small ramekin of salted peanuts and their Chinese version of kimchee which were complimentary. Unfortunately, upon closer inspection as my wife was getting ready to grab a piece of the napa cabbage used in the kimchee a single strand of course black hair was standing up like a lone weed in the ground!  YUCK....Of course we brought it to our server's attention and she emphatically said \"sorry.\"\n\nDishes that we ordered:\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup:  We all agreed this was the best dishes and the portion was big enough for four people. Noodles and beef were tasty as well as the spice (which was not as spicy as I thought it would be).\n\nGreen Onion Pancake: Blah - All dough and definitely lacked flavor. We had to dip it in the Spicy Beef Tendon dish juices in order to eat it.  We had four pieces remaining after we paid the bill. Kitchen needs to add more green onion in their pancakes or have a special dipping sauce to accompany this dish.\n\nSpicy Beef Tendon Cold Platter: I have had better that my brother in law has made. It was probably the second best dish\n\nCrispy Salt and Pepper Chicken:  Just so so. Didn't really stand out in my opinion. Kirin in the Richmond District is so much better. This dish just lacked flavor although the whole pieces of red chili were nice.\n\nPan Fried Pork and cabbage dumplings: Like many of the yelpsters - I have had better. Very disappointed in this dish as this is what this place is known for.\n\nShanghai Noodles with Pork: Okay - Yes , the noodles are hand made but again this dish did not stand out. The Napa cabbage mixed with this dish gave it a limp presentation wise and they could have chosen a more heartier green vegetable to make the presentation nicer.\n\nIn summary, I doubt that I will be coming back here again.

"], "author": "Mike L.", "review": "After reading some of these negative reviews, I think Susy C.'s review is spot on - those people just came in with the wrong expectations.  Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.  The center was pretty good too, as it was slightly chewy and not bready, and the fresh green onions helped to add a lot of great flavor.\n\n-- NAPA CABBAGE WITH PORK DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#4yE81GGRooZiWYQGK_gaFg)\nAlthough they weren't as tasty as others I've tried (still good), it was awesome how they were so packed with filling.  I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.  It was simple (pork belly, bok choy, and their house sauce), but well done.  The bits of pork were cooked perfectly (soft and tender) and I thought the sauce added a slight tartness to the dish.\n\nConsidering the three of us were able to try five things for a measly $40 (with leftovers), it's safe to say the portions at China North are both plentiful and cheap.  Which is a good thing too since between the various types of hand pulled noodle soups (particularly the spicy beef noodle soup) and all of the dumplings, there's plenty more to try!

If you want a real breakdown, it then varies from northeast to northwest by hand pulled noodles and the buns but I digress.\n\n- Northern China = colder climate which = limited range of food that can grow. As a result = pickled goodies (think garlic, scallions, leeks etc in oil and vinegar) \n\n- meat consumed is primarily beef and lamb\n\nSo for you noobs who order garlic cucumbers and whine about oil, don't come here looking for chow mein or fried rice either.  CHINA NORTH IS NOT SHANGHAINESE. There are NO XLBs here noobs!\n\nComplimentary peanuts and pickled cabbage upon seating. The pickled cabbage is spicy and tasty. \n\nChina North Dumpling does indeed have a variety of dumplings. They offer them steamed or pan fried. My friends and I took so damn long we decided to order the 3 vegetable dumplings [fried] and the mushroom and pork dumplings [steamed]. \nDon't let the 3 vegetable dumplings fool you, it is not vegetarian because there is shrimp. China North only offers vegetarian dumplings on the weekends. \n\nThe dumplings (both steamed and pan fried) were executed beautifully. Generous amounts of filling in the mushroom and pork especially. \n\nWe shared an order of the beef pancake wrap. I was a little disappointed there was no sour cabbage inside of it (that's a-ok w/ me it's just what I've grown accustomed to) but happy that there was no cilantro. The pancake itself looked delicate because it was so thin, but it held up the beef and hoisin sauce that was already inside pretty well. The pancake was crispy. Definitely order this.\n\nI had the spicy beef noodle soup w/ hand made noodles. Oh man. They gave me plenty of beef and there is PLENTY of noodles. The handmade noodles are thick and starchy (duh) and so filling. I LOVE THEM. They are cooked perfectly al dente and the spicy beef noodle soup broth is excellent. A good amount of cumin (totes normal for northern Chinese) and definitely hit the spot. \n\nI had a few bites of my friend's sesame handmade noodles. This is a cold noodle dish, and served with sliced cucumbers. Very refreshing but also filling because of the hand noodles. It would probably be best to share with another person. \nMy other friend had the dumpling noodle soup (also with handmade noodles) which was good and plentiful. The dumplings in his order had minced shrimp in it so I didn't try. \n\nTotal damage was about $50 and we had leftovers. \n\nI'm coming back to try more dumplings. Definitely don't shy away from the handmade noodles. The noodles and dumplings are made fresh here. I mean let's be real, you're not going to go to HOPR and order the fish right?

Arriving at 5:45 pm, the place was empty as it was on the early side for dinner and only three tables were occupied including ours. There were several servers with one hand preparing the pot stickers  two tables away from us. I literally had to do jumping jacks to get someone's attention letting them know we were ready to order.\n\nWith that being said and our order placed, our server came back with a small ramekin of salted peanuts and their Chinese version of kimchee which were complimentary. Unfortunately, upon closer inspection as my wife was getting ready to grab a piece of the napa cabbage used in the kimchee a single strand of course black hair was standing up like a lone weed in the ground!  YUCK....Of course we brought it to our server's attention and she emphatically said \"sorry.\"\n\nDishes that we ordered:\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup:  We all agreed this was the best dishes and the portion was big enough for four people. Noodles and beef were tasty as well as the spice (which was not as spicy as I thought it would be).\n\nGreen Onion Pancake: Blah - All dough and definitely lacked flavor. We had to dip it in the Spicy Beef Tendon dish juices in order to eat it.  We had four pieces remaining after we paid the bill. Kitchen needs to add more green onion in their pancakes or have a special dipping sauce to accompany this dish.\n\nSpicy Beef Tendon Cold Platter: I have had better that my brother in law has made. It was probably the second best dish\n\nCrispy Salt and Pepper Chicken:  Just so so. Didn't really stand out in my opinion. Kirin in the Richmond District is so much better. This dish just lacked flavor although the whole pieces of red chili were nice.\n\nPan Fried Pork and cabbage dumplings: Like many of the yelpsters - I have had better. Very disappointed in this dish as this is what this place is known for.\n\nShanghai Noodles with Pork: Okay - Yes , the noodles are hand made but again this dish did not stand out.

Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.

I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.

Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.  The center was pretty good too, as it was slightly chewy and not bready, and the fresh green onions helped to add a lot of great flavor.\n\n-- NAPA CABBAGE WITH PORK DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#4yE81GGRooZiWYQGK_gaFg)\nAlthough they weren't as tasty as others I've tried (still good), it was awesome how they were so packed with filling.  I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.

I literally had to do jumping jacks to get someone's attention letting them know we were ready to order.\n\nWith that being said and our order placed, our server came back with a small ramekin of salted peanuts and their Chinese version of kimchee which were complimentary. Unfortunately, upon closer inspection as my wife was getting ready to grab a piece of the napa cabbage used in the kimchee a single strand of course black hair was standing up like a lone weed in the ground!  YUCK....Of course we brought it to our server's attention and she emphatically said \"sorry.\"\n\nDishes that we ordered:\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup:  We all agreed this was the best dishes and the portion was big enough for four people. Noodles and beef were tasty as well as the spice (which was not as spicy as I thought it would be).\n\nGreen Onion Pancake: Blah - All dough and definitely lacked flavor. We had to dip it in the Spicy Beef Tendon dish juices in order to eat it.  We had four pieces remaining after we paid the bill. Kitchen needs to add more green onion in their pancakes or have a special dipping sauce to accompany this dish.\n\nSpicy Beef Tendon Cold Platter: I have had better that my brother in law has made. It was probably the second best dish\n\nCrispy Salt and Pepper Chicken:  Just so so. Didn't really stand out in my opinion. Kirin in the Richmond District is so much better. This dish just lacked flavor although the whole pieces of red chili were nice.\n\nPan Fried Pork and cabbage dumplings: Like many of the yelpsters - I have had better. Very disappointed in this dish as this is what this place is known for.\n\nShanghai Noodles with Pork: Okay - Yes , the noodles are hand made but again this dish did not stand out. The Napa cabbage mixed with this dish gave it a limp presentation wise and they could have chosen a more heartier green vegetable to make the presentation nicer.\n\nIn summary, I doubt that I will be coming back here again. On a separate note. We left after 1.5 hours only to find a line at the door. I still can't figure that one out but perhaps it the reasonable prices.", "rating": 2, "date": "2015-02-01"}, {"excerpts": ["For meat, we had the crispy salt and pepper chicken which was not greasy and had a little heat.

Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.  The center was pretty good too, as it was slightly chewy and not bready, and the fresh green onions helped to add a lot of great flavor.\n\n-- NAPA CABBAGE WITH PORK DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#4yE81GGRooZiWYQGK_gaFg)\nAlthough they weren't as tasty as others I've tried (still good), it was awesome how they were so packed with filling.  I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.

If you want a real breakdown, it then varies from northeast to northwest by hand pulled noodles and the buns but I digress.\n\n- Northern China = colder climate which = limited range of food that can grow. As a result = pickled goodies (think garlic, scallions, leeks etc in oil and vinegar) \n\n- meat consumed is primarily beef and lamb\n\nSo for you noobs who order garlic cucumbers and whine about oil, don't come here looking for chow mein or fried rice either.  CHINA NORTH IS NOT SHANGHAINESE. There are NO XLBs here noobs!\n\nComplimentary peanuts and pickled cabbage upon seating. The pickled cabbage is spicy and tasty. \n\nChina North Dumpling does indeed have a variety of dumplings. They offer them steamed or pan fried. My friends and I took so damn long we decided to order the 3 vegetable dumplings [fried] and the mushroom and pork dumplings [steamed]. \nDon't let the 3 vegetable dumplings fool you, it is not vegetarian because there is shrimp. China North only offers vegetarian dumplings on the weekends. \n\nThe dumplings (both steamed and pan fried) were executed beautifully. Generous amounts of filling in the mushroom and pork especially. \n\nWe shared an order of the beef pancake wrap. I was a little disappointed there was no sour cabbage inside of it (that's a-ok w/ me it's just what I've grown accustomed to) but happy that there was no cilantro. The pancake itself looked delicate because it was so thin, but it held up the beef and hoisin sauce that was already inside pretty well. The pancake was crispy. Definitely order this.\n\nI had the spicy beef noodle soup w/ hand made noodles. Oh man. They gave me plenty of beef and there is PLENTY of noodles. The handmade noodles are thick and starchy (duh) and so filling. I LOVE THEM. They are cooked perfectly al dente and the spicy beef noodle soup broth is excellent. A good amount of cumin (totes normal for northern Chinese) and definitely hit the spot. \n\nI had a few bites of my friend's sesame handmade noodles. This is a cold noodle dish, and served with sliced cucumbers. Very refreshing but also filling because of the hand noodles. It would probably be best to share with another person. \nMy other friend had the dumpling noodle soup (also with handmade noodles) which was good and plentiful. The dumplings in his order had minced shrimp in it so I didn't try. \n\nTotal damage was about $50 and we had leftovers. \n\nI'm coming back to try more dumplings.

If you want a real breakdown, it then varies from northeast to northwest by hand pulled noodles and the buns but I digress.\n\n- Northern China = colder climate which = limited range of food that can grow. As a result = pickled goodies (think garlic, scallions, leeks etc in oil and vinegar) \n\n- meat consumed is primarily beef and lamb\n\nSo for you noobs who order garlic cucumbers and whine about oil, don't come here looking for chow mein or fried rice either.  CHINA NORTH IS NOT SHANGHAINESE. There are NO XLBs here noobs!\n\nComplimentary peanuts and pickled cabbage upon seating. The pickled cabbage is spicy and tasty. \n\nChina North Dumpling does indeed have a variety of dumplings. They offer them steamed or pan fried. My friends and I took so damn long we decided to order the 3 vegetable dumplings [fried] and the mushroom and pork dumplings [steamed]. \nDon't let the 3 vegetable dumplings fool you, it is not vegetarian because there is shrimp. China North only offers vegetarian dumplings on the weekends. \n\nThe dumplings (both steamed and pan fried) were executed beautifully. Generous amounts of filling in the mushroom and pork especially. \n\nWe shared an order of the beef pancake wrap. I was a little disappointed there was no sour cabbage inside of it (that's a-ok w/ me it's just what I've grown accustomed to) but happy that there was no cilantro. The pancake itself looked delicate because it was so thin, but it held up the beef and hoisin sauce that was already inside pretty well. The pancake was crispy. Definitely order this.\n\nI had the spicy beef noodle soup w/ hand made noodles. Oh man. They gave me plenty of beef and there is PLENTY of noodles. The handmade noodles are thick and starchy (duh) and so filling. I LOVE THEM. They are cooked perfectly al dente and the spicy beef noodle soup broth is excellent. A good amount of cumin (totes normal for northern Chinese) and definitely hit the spot. \n\nI had a few bites of my friend's sesame handmade noodles. This is a cold noodle dish, and served with sliced cucumbers. Very refreshing but also filling because of the hand noodles. It would probably be best to share with another person. \nMy other friend had the dumpling noodle soup (also with handmade noodles) which was good and plentiful. The dumplings in his order had minced shrimp in it so I didn't try. \n\nTotal damage was about $50 and we had leftovers. \n\nI'm coming back to try more dumplings.

Although they do offer a few dishes from other Chinese cuisines, China North Dumpling (as its name suggests) focuses mainly on Northern Chinese dishes.  What does that entail, exactly?  Noodles and dumplings galore!\n\nWhile it may be disappointing for some not to see a favorite like Xiao Long Baos on the menu, China North has plenty of other great dishes to offer - about 160+ in total?  It's impressive that they can offer such an extensive range of appetizers, cold dishes, noodles, vegetable/tofu dishes, soups, seafood, and, of course, numerous types of dumplings (other than XLB).\n\n-- GREEN ONION PANCAKE...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#hqTKQ18DOMPJXD0N6zHPpw)\nIt was thicker than I typically prefer (thin and crispy), but the outside had a nice crust.  The center was pretty good too, as it was slightly chewy and not bready, and the fresh green onions helped to add a lot of great flavor.\n\n-- NAPA CABBAGE WITH PORK DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#4yE81GGRooZiWYQGK_gaFg)\nAlthough they weren't as tasty as others I've tried (still good), it was awesome how they were so packed with filling.  I wonder if the ones with mushroom or chives would have been better, but these were still solid overall.\n\n-- PAN FRIED DUMPLING...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#kpMtuyZ3pdrTKGisPAFoEw)\nLike with the dumplings, every one of these was loaded.  In this case though, the filling was both savorier and juicier.  The bottom crust was the highlight though - the skin had the perfect consistency and the bottom was so nicely browned!\n\n-- SHANGHAI STYLE CHOW MEIN (with Hand Made Noodles)...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#egMPX5J2nxWtfAjLDl3R1w)\nEven though they aren't very long (perfect for kids though), the hand made noodles are a plus.  They had just slight bite to them, and the sauce on the noodles was terrific.  A little more meat would have been nice, but it was just fine otherwise.\n\n-- HOUSE SPECIAL PORK...$8.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-north-dumpling-san-francisco?select=1g75lAzSyjmMm7P2jSh3bg#e6PEnwsgThYMy4kZcdF8Tw)\nWhile all of the other dishes were good, this one stood out the most.  It was simple (pork belly, bok choy, and their house sauce), but well done.  The bits of pork were cooked perfectly (soft and tender) and I thought the sauce added a slight tartness to the dish.\n\nConsidering the three of us were able to try five things for a measly $40 (with leftovers), it's safe to say the portions at China North are both plentiful and cheap.
