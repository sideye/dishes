I think Fish N Gari falls into the (very) good category. \n\nI came her with a couple friends who live in the neighborhood and seemed to know this place pretty well. It was empty when we walked in (it's a pretty tiny place) & the guy who was helping us (I'm assuming he was the owner) was very friendly. Honestly, I'm pretty open to anything when it comes to sushi so I let my dining companions do the ordering. \n\nWe started with gyoza, which I really liked. It was a little on the crispy side, which is how I like it. We also ordered a cucumber salad, which was, well...a cucumber salad (it's hard to mess that one up). We didn't even order edamame, but they brought it to us anyway just for the heck of it. I also don't know if it's because we ordered quite a bit of nigri & sushi, but they also randomly brought us a some sort of tuna dish. It was kind of like tataki, but was more cooked. It was yummy. \n\nAll of the nigri we ordered was good, and tasted fresh. The rolls we ordered included the Dragon roll, which I LOVED (eel +tempura + avocado is a delicious combination). We also did a Snow Beauty roll, which I really liked. I wasn't too familiar with butter fish, but I really liked it (we also had butter fish nigri). My favorite of the three rolls though was the Ocean Breeze. It tasted fresh and yummy!\n\nWe also sipped on unfiltered sake, which you can't go wrong with all. \n\nAll in all, this a great little neighborhood spot, which I would come back to. \n\nOoh...I should also mention they pretty fun music!
