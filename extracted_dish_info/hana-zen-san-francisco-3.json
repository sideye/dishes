The restaurant fit in the upscale casual market niche.  Our server, Sheryl, was doubling as hostess that evening, and immediately let us know that it was happy hour.  The bar was almost full, and she offered to let us have happy hour food and beverages at our table so we would not have to move.\n\nWe decided to go with a tapas style meal and choose different items to eat.  Our first three choices came off the happy hour menu and included traditional edammame ($4), a crunchy California roll ($6 for eight pieces) and a spicy tuna roll ($6 for six pieces). While all three were basic choices, the presentation of the two rolls showed the sushi chefs had some real skills.\n\nThey further showcased their abilities with our second course of sushi nigiri ($5.50-$8.50 for two pieces). All the fish was very fresh and perfectly sized.  We had yellowtail, white tuna belly and red snapper sashimi; with flying fish roe halibut and sea urchin sushi.  \n\nOur final course included three items from the main menu appetizers section, Goma-ae ($4.95 Boiled Spinach Salad), Gyuhireniku Tataki ($7.95 Beef Carpaccio Japanese style) and Deep Fried Scallops($12).

With a lot of great options in San Francisco, including many sushi restaurants, our expectations were high going into the meal and we were not disappointed.   \n\nHanna has two locations in the city and we visited the one on the end of Pier 39. The restaurant fit in the upscale casual market niche.  Our server, Sheryl, was doubling as hostess that evening, and immediately let us know that it was happy hour.  The bar was almost full, and she offered to let us have happy hour food and beverages at our table so we would not have to move.\n\nWe decided to go with a tapas style meal and choose different items to eat.  Our first three choices came off the happy hour menu and included traditional edammame ($4), a crunchy California roll ($6 for eight pieces) and a spicy tuna roll ($6 for six pieces). While all three were basic choices, the presentation of the two rolls showed the sushi chefs had some real skills.\n\nThey further showcased their abilities with our second course of sushi nigiri ($5.50-$8.50 for two pieces). All the fish was very fresh and perfectly sized.  We had yellowtail, white tuna belly and red snapper sashimi; with flying fish roe halibut and sea urchin sushi.  \n\nOur final course included three items from the main menu appetizers section, Goma-ae ($4.95 Boiled Spinach Salad), Gyuhireniku Tataki ($7.95 Beef Carpaccio Japanese style) and Deep Fried Scallops($12).  Wow! The Carpaccio was presented in a mix of finely cut vegetable in a ponzu sauce that really popped in your mouth.  We wished there were more pieces to share.  The Goma-ae was served with a light sesame dressing with toasted sesame seeds on top.   The scallops  were a big surprise with the breading being a light Panko covering with a mild-spicy mayo on the side.  \n\nSheryl moved the meal along through each course which included wine and micro-brews from the bar.  She was great at balancing too much and too little attention to our experience.  There are no white table clothes on the table and you can dress evening casual to meals here.

Actually, I don't think they menu has changed.  Now that I'm thinking about it, I think the waiter just wasn't familiar with the menu.  Also, there seemed to be a language barrier, but I'm not 100% sure.  Anyway, I ordered the Lunch menu: Zen's sushi combination and a seaweed salad.  \n\nMy co-workers ordered a few vegetarian sushi items from the menu.  One thing they ordered was two avocado rolls.  These are just like rice, seaweed, and avocado, and they're cheap.   \n\nWhen our food came, their avocado rolls had magically morphed into salmon and avocado rolls.  They told the waiter they ordered just avocado, but the waiter didn't seem to understand at first, and then he didn't seem to know what to do, so as the situation got more and more of a hassle, they just said they would take the salmon/avocado rolls so to avoid wasting food.  I should add, one co-worker doesn't want to eat salmon for ethical reasons, but he'd rather eat it than have it thrown out.  The other co-worker doesn't like raw salmon.  \n\nSO, they took the rolls.  The waiter seemed relieved.\n\nThe food was predictably dreadful.  (And the company was predictably delightful, THANK GOD FOR THAT).\n\nWhen the bill came, we were noticed we weren't comped the 30% discount (a main factor in our deciding to go there, by the way), and my co-workers were surprised to see that they were charged for two salmon avocado rolls @ almost $7 dollars each rather than two of the cheaper $5 avocado rolls. (I think that's still too much, but whatever).  Taking the salmon was kind of a hardship for them.  They just ate it to make things easier.  No one thought they'd be charged a higher price on top of that.\n\nI took the bill back to the waiter and explained to him that we should get a 30% discount on Thursdays due to a local merchant agreement. And I pointed on the bill where he'd billed us for the more expensive sushi we didn't order.  My co-workers didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I just told him that they didn't really want the salmon, and they just took it as a favor, so it didn't seem fair to charge them for something more expensive than what they actually ordered, particularly since they only took it so it wouldn't go in the trash.  \n\nHe returned with the re-worded bill.  Still being charged for the choked-down salmon, and the discount? now upped from 0% to 15%.\n\nWe left because it was a pleasant lunch and we didn't want to ruin it by bickering over ten or twelve bucks.\n\nI will probably avoid going back to this place.

The view is probably amazing during the day but it was a stormy night for us so all we say was blackness accented by little dots of light in the bay, with the occasional pedestrian scurrying by to avoid the rain. Not bad overall tho. \n\nThe service seemed sluggish. If they had just opened or were reopening, its understandable that it could be a little slow but that wasn't the end of it. Our food came out in a very odd order. We ordered edamame  and 3 rolls. The rolls came out haphazardly with the edamame  coming out after a roll had already arrived. This was just odd. They must have forgotten about the edamame  and then brought it once they remembered. Kinda strange. So Slow and maybe forgetful, with very few checks ins. Not great traits. \n\nOn to the food. Ok so first we ordered the Sunset Strip roll, a spicy tempura shrimp roll, and a spicy tuna. The spicy tuna roll was just what you would expect and was fine. Not great, but fine. The Sunset Strip roll was a special roll, so it was kinda pricey but not really that good. It had a lot of fish wrapped in cucumber, so it was unique, but lacked that special flavor combination that you expect when you order sushi. It was just various fish that melded to make generic fish flavor and lacked any sort of real depth. So it just seemed like a rip off. The spicy tempura roll however, was great. It had a nice crunch and good spice to it, with a good back of tuna flavor bringing up the rear, a good Crunch Spice Tuna combo that hit you satisfyingly. Quite good. In fact it was the restaurants saving grace. I mean without that roll, I would have been upset at the fact we ate here. But the combo of having the coupon and this roll saved my mood. Actually, come to think of it, the only reason I wasn't mad was that we had the discount coupon for it. This is important because I was going to go 2 stars for my experience, but for everyone else who didn't have the coupon, I am going to have to go 1 because the food and experience simply was not worth it.

The bar was almost full, and she offered to let us have happy hour food and beverages at our table so we would not have to move.\n\nWe decided to go with a tapas style meal and choose different items to eat.  Our first three choices came off the happy hour menu and included traditional edammame ($4), a crunchy California roll ($6 for eight pieces) and a spicy tuna roll ($6 for six pieces). While all three were basic choices, the presentation of the two rolls showed the sushi chefs had some real skills.\n\nThey further showcased their abilities with our second course of sushi nigiri ($5.50-$8.50 for two pieces). All the fish was very fresh and perfectly sized.  We had yellowtail, white tuna belly and red snapper sashimi; with flying fish roe halibut and sea urchin sushi.  \n\nOur final course included three items from the main menu appetizers section, Goma-ae ($4.95 Boiled Spinach Salad), Gyuhireniku Tataki ($7.95 Beef Carpaccio Japanese style) and Deep Fried Scallops($12).  Wow! The Carpaccio was presented in a mix of finely cut vegetable in a ponzu sauce that really popped in your mouth.  We wished there were more pieces to share.  The Goma-ae was served with a light sesame dressing with toasted sesame seeds on top.   The scallops  were a big surprise with the breading being a light Panko covering with a mild-spicy mayo on the side.  \n\nSheryl moved the meal along through each course which included wine and micro-brews from the bar.

However, the service we did receive was exceptional. Each person was nice and polite, visiting each time with a smile and ready to provide what you need. \n\nThe hot food seemed way overpriced, so we opted for a few basic and special rolls and vegetable tempura. At first glance, every thing on the sushi menu seemed to be fried, crunchy, or covered in something fried. We ordered the kamikaze roll with yellowtail, rock n' roll, Lion King roll (with raw salmon, instead of baked salmon on top), and the Hana Zen roll. Each were well-rolled, a good ratio of each ingredient (i.e. not a mouthful of rice), and fresh. The tempura was alright. The batter wasn't crispy enough, but there was a good variety of veggies. \n\nThe owners were actually Japanese, which is a good sign. I was disappointed that we were charged $3.50 for green tea from a tea bag. For a legitimate Japanese restaurant, I would expect that they could provide real green tea brewed from real green tea leaves. They wouldn't be breaking the bank if they brewed tea right. Even worse, we were charged for \"Numi Organic\" tea, when we were actually served something cheap. \n\nThis place could have five stars if they didn't skimp on the brewing proper tea that they charge for and if they could pick up the service.", "rating": 3, "date": "2011-04-10"}], "spicy shrimp tempura roll": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered edamame for an appetizer, and a Sunset Strip, and a Spicy Shrimp Tempura roll.

So far so good.\n\nWe ordered edamame for an appetizer, and a Sunset Strip, and a Spicy Shrimp Tempura roll. Since both rolls were specialty rolls, which are generally larger, we thought this would be enough.\n\nFirst major failure - the first item we got was the Sunset Strip. This was 5 pieces of small cubes of fish wrapped in cucumber. I thought this would come with some other filler, but no, it was glorified (expensive) nigiri. And only 5 small pieces.\n\nAfter seeing this tragic roll and scarfing it down, we realized we would be starving without something else, so we quickly ordered a Spicy Tuna roll to supplement. \n\nOrdered after, the Spicy Tuna was the next thing to come out. It was ok, quite spicy, but overall just ok. 2.5 stars.\n\nFINALLY, 2 out of 3 rolls down, our edamame comes out. Great, we finally get to snack on our appetizer.\n\nLastly, the Spicy Shrimp Tempura roll comes out. This is the only saving grace of this restaurant. It was good. 4 stars for this roll alone.\n\nThank god I had gotten an internet deal for $20 off our meal, cause had we paid full price for the worst service and food delivery I've ever experienced, I couldn't have given the saving grace extra star. \n\nI give this place 6 months, tops, before it's out of business.

My wife went with Hot Lava Rock - Asian Chicken. It was a raw Chicken breast served on 500 degree stone. You have to cook it to your taste on the stone. Interesting concept and but not something I would try again. We had also ordered the Goma-ae  (spinach salad), was ok but not worth coming back for. The two stars are for the view and the service, no star for food.\n\n#onetimer ; #touristtrap", "rating": 2, "date": "2015-11-08"}], "pork tenderloin": [], "scallops and prawns": [], "lamb chops": [], "vegetable tempura and grilled vegetables": [], "vegetable sushi": []}
