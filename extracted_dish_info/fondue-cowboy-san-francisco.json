I would've never sought out this restaurant on my own, but came here as part of a large group for a close friend's birthday.  So please take what I have to say about the cheese fondue with a grain of salt.\n\nI found the cheese fondue here to be incredibly bland, probably because it was garlic-free.  My partner and I split two different fondues:\n\nFirst we tried The Traditional ($18, Swiss Gruyere, Ementhaller, White Wine, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us), Fresh Ground Nutmeg).  Gruyere is my favorite cheese and I LOVE nutmeg in my creamy/cheesy sauces, so this seemed like it should be a no-brainer for me...but I found it intensely bland.  And of the items that were available to dip in it, the only two items that I a) wasn 't allergic to, or b) didn't hate (gerkins, olives) wound up being raw broccoli and bland pieces of bread (my partner tried the roasted potatoes that came with it as well, but I couldn't eat these because they, too, were cooked in garlic oil).\n\nThe second cheese fondue we tried was The Rawhide ($18;  Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us)).  While both of us agreed that this was the better of the two fondues we ordered, it still didn't have tons of flavor and seemed to be overwhelmed by the Emmenthaler...in fact, it didn't taste too terribly different from the first fondue we tried.  It was vastly improved, though, by adding copious amounts of salt...!\n\nDessert was a huge hit for me:  We ordered the Happy Trails ($16; Dark Chocolate with Cayenne).  At my request, they left out the cayenne, since I am not a fan of pepper, and only brought us grapes and bananas for the fruit (I'm allergic to their other fruit offerings).  My favorite things to dip into the delicious chocolate turned out to be the chocolate bread (!!!!) and madeleines...very tasty!!!\n\nSo if I was generally underwhelmed by 2/3 of my dinner, why am I giving this place 4 stars?  The service was AWESOME.  They were attentive, responsive, polite, and friendly.  They catered to my special requests without batting an eyelash.  The food arrived in a timely fashion, the mixed drinks we ordered were delicious and well-balanced, and the ambiance was warm, inviting, and cozy.  It was a relatively quiet restaurant, which was really nice for conversation with my friends, and the seats were super-comfortable, especially for a big-butted woman like me.  \n\nIt's not Fondue Cowboy's fault that I'm not really into fondue...and if someone invited me to go here with them for dinner sometime, I wouldn't hesitate to say yes.

These are my favorites:\n\nThe Traditional~ $24 a sharp, rich nutty pool of Swiss-only cheeses (Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental), white wine and nutmeg\n\nOutlaw ~ $24 robust mix of cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro\n\nRawhide ~ $24 Italian Dolce Gorgonzola and Emmenthaler gives it a nice kick, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic\n\nAnd if you think you have already been treated to a decadent meal it hasn't ended yet.  You have a choice of sweet sinful treats ~ $20 like  Happy Trails which is Dark Chocolate with Cayenne, the Buck-A-Roo ~Milk Chocolate and High Noon ~White Chocolate.  All are tempting but I have never had space for dessert.  So I must come in one day just for the sweet fondue.  They also have salads but I can eat a salad anywhere so I want to reserve all the space to stuff myself with  rich warm gooey melted cheese!\n\nGreat place for conversation and connection. The fondue is generous ~ good for two, imaginative and delicious, with something for everyone. Been here many times and have brought friends here to enjoy Fondue Cowboy just as much as I do!

Great place for fondue tapas snacks with draft wine.  The sweet fondue was just the right size, but the savory left me wanting for more.  Many of the dippers remained undipped due to inadequate cheese.\n\nThe Outlaw: Pretty soupy for fondue, was difficult getting the cheese to cling to any dipper except the bread.

Would have preferred that they steer towards a cheddar & ale Welsh rarebit since this incarnation of the cheddar was not that sophisticated.\n\nThe Stage Coach: AWESOME!  I could have easily ate a gallon of this.  Compte is such a brilliant cheese choice because of it's like the traditional fondue gruy\u00e8re, but with more personality.

The raw broccoli was a bit overpowering, even when smothered in cheese.  Apples and grapes were provided, not my thing but I suppose others like them.\n\nCured Meats Platter: Wish they skipped the melons and gave more meat.  Already enough fruit in the standard dipper selection.  The meats were prosciutto and thinly sliced salamis.  The cheese overpowered their subtlety, probably would have been better to have some cooked sausages like chorizo or kielbasa for a meatier side dish. \n\nHappy Trails: The cayenne had a bit of a kick in the first dip, but faded into the heavy dark chocolate pool afterwards.  Was very creamy for dark chocolate, but kept the bitter cocoa bite.  Seemed more like dark chocolate custard as opposed to melted dark chocolate, perhaps they need to ease up on the half-n-half.\n\nDippers for Sweet Fondue: The freshly sliced fruit was a win - strawberries, bananas and bing cherries.  The chocolate bread wasn't that chocolaty, which is actually good else it would have been overkill.  I wasn't keen on the regular bread since that's just weird in chocolate.

This fondue was my favorite, had a bit of a kick to it and did not have a strong wine taste.\n\nThe Quick Draw: manchego, white wine, roasted red puree, roasted garlic. Probably my least favorite out of the three and did not have a strong flavor, but it was still good.\n\nDessert Fondue:\nServed with marshmallows, bread, kiwi, strawberries, madelines and tangerines.\n\nHappy Trails: dark chocolate with cayenne. You MUST order this! I loved the dark chocolate dessert fondue and would go back just to have it for dessert. I liked that the cayenne taste was not weak and you could actually taste it.\n\nOther:\n\nRoasted Beet Salad: arugula, goat cheese, toasted walnuts and tarragon vinaigrette.

I fully admit that my review is colored by a comparison to La Fondue in Saratoga (see end of this review). Not having been to La Fondue, I might have given this place 4 stars. One star down for narrow offerings and the other star down for value for price. \n\nAtmosphere - Thematically \"western\" but with a sophisticated and elegant twist. A nice atmosphere for a date with dim lighting. The place is very small (reservations recommended) and probably cannot dine more than 20 people at tables at any given time. \n\nService - Excellent. Our waitress was attentive and professional. We saw another group of 6 come in while we were there who had accidentally booked their reservation for the next evening. They made every effort to accomodate them at the bar when all the tables were taken. \n\nFood - Tasty, but little that is special. Here's the hard, cold truth. Fondue is essentially easy. You melt cheese/chocolate in a pot and cut up some veggies/fruit to dip in it. If you're going to pay someone to make fondue for you, there should be something special. The cheese fondues had a decent selection allowing options for traditional \"authentic\" Swiss fondue and then other flavor combinations that were well thought out and differed enough from each other to make each a unique offering. The chocolate fondues, I found lacking. There were three options - dark with cayenne, milk with walnuts, white with strawberry. First, white chocolate isn't even chocolate, but it might float some people's boats so sure - keep it on the menu. For folks actually looking for chocolate you are left with two options. There are so many amazing things you can do with chocolate fondue so I find the narrow selection worthy taking off a star. The dipping options? The chocolate bread from the local bakery was different and special, but the other selections were not. 4 tiny marshmallows, a selection of fruit, and cut up Madeline cookies (which instantly crumbled and got lost in the fondue is just nothing special to me. \n\nOther things to note - They do not have a full bar and their wine/beer selection is limited, but tasty. They have very limited drink options for someone who does not drink alcohol or caffeine. It might be difficult to get a filling meal if you are kosher, vegetarian, or gluten-free. It's 3.5 blocks from the Civic Center BART station, but I don't recommend walking that distance alone at night as the streets are mostly vacant and rather dark. \n\nFor the best fondue experience available, check out my review of La Fondue in Saratoga. I would only recommend this place if there were transportation limitations that made driving down to Saratoga impossible or if you were just looking for an appetizer/dessert to begin/end a date in the city. \n\nAt La Fondue you can order piece-meal if you just want cheese or just want chocolate, but they also have a $90 feast for two where you each get a (1) choice of 3 delicious salads, (2) a choice of several cheese fondues paired with bread and veggies, (3) an entree course where you can have a grill, broth, or oil paired with a 4 oz portion of 6 meats including seafood, high-end cuts like filet minon, and exotic meets like kangaroo, and (4) a choice of several cheese fondues including a Frangelico fondue, a Godiva liquor fondue, and a rocky road one all of which are paired with the usual fruits, but also marshmallows, cookie dough, cream puffs, rice krispie balls, and snickers. \n\nFondue Cowboy has only a piece-meal menu. For two people to get salads, a cheese fondue, a supplemental plate of 3 cured meats, and a chocolate fondue costs $72.

There was not anything wrong with the food selections that it came with. If you are a bit more hungry, they also offer meat portions for an extra cost. Since we were getting a dessert fondue after, we decided not to get the meat portion with our fondue. We definitely will try the meat though next time we come! \n\nThe dessert though was amazing! The food items it came with (fruit, Madeline's, chocolate bread, and marshmallows) were perfect and made it a delicious dessert.\n\nOur waiter, forgot to ask his name, was EXTREMELY hospitable, kind, and caring throughout our stay. Knowing this is owned by him and his partner also was an interesting fact about Fondue Cowboy and how it was started out! \n\nIt is a small restaurant so I would recommend making reservations ahead of time. When we got there it was not packed at all..15 minutes later it was a full house! \n\nThank you so much for making our 3 year anniversary extra special!!!

It is a small place with a bar and maybe 5 tables. Paul greeted us when we arrived. Just an FYI, kids can sit at the bar since they serve food there. \n\nThe fondue menu has several options. Since our daughter was with us, we chose the more milder of the fondues. The Outlaw. Each fondue comes with bread, roasted potatoes, black olives, and pickles. For dessert, we had the Happy Trails dark chocolate fondue. It comes with marshmallows, strawberries, banana, and kiwi. All together, an incredible mix. \n\nThe bar serves beer and wine. The wine list is simple, but good. A little on the pricey side, but after all, it's San Francisco. \n\nFinding Cowboy Fondue was easy. It's a small place, but the sign is unique so you can't miss it.

The offerings covered a nice variety too:\n\nThe Traditional Fondue is a mix of swiss gruyere, emmenthaler, white wine, and spiced with roasted garlic, fresh ground nutmeg     \n \nThe Outlaw is a combination of aged cheddar, beer, slow roasted tomatoes, and spiced with roasted garlic, roasted jalapeno, cilantro  \n    \nThe Stage Coach mixes compte cheese, white wine, and is also spiced with roasted garlic      \n\nThe Quick Draw features manchego, white wine, roasted red puree, and is also spiced with roasted garlic   \n   \nAnd the Rawhide melts italian dolce gorgonzola, emmenthaler, white wine base together and is spiced with bacon and roasted garlic.\n\nThese fondues are each $18 and they come with substantial amount and mix of Roasted Potatoes, Sourbread sections, Fresh Broccoli, cut Apples and Olives.\n\nWe just ordered the first TWO (2) on the menu (The Traditional Fondue and the Outlaw Fondue) and we had at it.  I reserved my share of apples for the end and chose not to dip that in cheese, but every thing else was fair game and delicious.  \n\nI think for me the best sensual experience about the fondue is the delicious fragrance of the heated wine and melted cheese together.  It really fires up the taste buds if done right, and these 2 selections were absolutely magnificent in charging up my tongue.\n\nI had tongue-gasm one right after another with each delicious bite.\n\nThere were also a selection of meat fondues and dessert fondues, but we were just cheese-purists this night.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you really want to satisfy your \"cheese craving\" in a pretty spectacular way, a trek to Fondue Cowboy will appeal to all of your senses as well as your appetite!", "rating": 5, "date": "2011-03-07"}, {"excerpts": ["Tried the outlaw as it was recommended in most reviews and turned out to be amazingly delicious.

Many of the dippers remained undipped due to inadequate cheese.\n\nThe Outlaw: Pretty soupy for fondue, was difficult getting the cheese to cling to any dipper except the bread.  Tasty but bordered too closely to a nacho dip with the tomatoes, garlic, cilantro and jalape\u00f1os.  Would have preferred that they steer towards a cheddar & ale Welsh rarebit since this incarnation of the cheddar was not that sophisticated.\n\nThe Stage Coach: AWESOME!  I could have easily ate a gallon of this.  Compte is such a brilliant cheese choice because of it's like the traditional fondue gruy\u00e8re, but with more personality.  I think there were some well paired mushrooms in it too.  Perfect consistency for any dipper.\n\nDippers for Savory Fondue: The whole grain bread and roasted small potatoes worked well.  The raw broccoli was a bit overpowering, even when smothered in cheese.  Apples and grapes were provided, not my thing but I suppose others like them.\n\nCured Meats Platter: Wish they skipped the melons and gave more meat.  Already enough fruit in the standard dipper selection.  The meats were prosciutto and thinly sliced salamis.  The cheese overpowered their subtlety, probably would have been better to have some cooked sausages like chorizo or kielbasa for a meatier side dish. \n\nHappy Trails: The cayenne had a bit of a kick in the first dip, but faded into the heavy dark chocolate pool afterwards.  Was very creamy for dark chocolate, but kept the bitter cocoa bite.  Seemed more like dark chocolate custard as opposed to melted dark chocolate, perhaps they need to ease up on the half-n-half.\n\nDippers for Sweet Fondue: The freshly sliced fruit was a win - strawberries, bananas and bing cherries.  The chocolate bread wasn't that chocolaty, which is actually good else it would have been overkill.  I wasn't keen on the regular bread since that's just weird in chocolate.  Wish they had some cookies, angel food cake pieces or brownies for dipping.", "rating": 4, "date": "2010-06-17"}, {"excerpts": ["The Outlaw cheese fondue is soooooo delicious!

I also tried the High Noon, which is white chocolate with balsamic strawberry puree. The High Noon is good if you like your desserts very sweet. The strawberry really complements it well but I didn't taste much balsamic in it. And those tealight candles really work very well for keeping the chocolate warm.

One of the gals made reservations online and we took up about half of the restaurant with a long table and stools they had set up for us. The decor was warm, dark, and inviting and the space was quiet enough that we weren't screaming to hear each other.\n\nWe ordered four types of cheeses, several platters of dippers (mostly bread and potatoes), two sweet chocolate fondues (milk with walnuts and dark with cayenne), and wine for the table. We also had some plates of pickles and olives to compliment. My favorite savory fondue was the Outlaw which is cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic, and jalapeno. For sweet fondues, the dark chocolate with cayenne had a bit too much cayenne for my taste, and I preferred the milk.\n\nAlthough we occupied half the restaurant for several hours the staff never once rushed us (10 chatty women + wine = an all-night gossip-fest).\n\nThe damage? Less than $25/pp after tax and tip. That's WITH alcohol, my friends.\n\nThere are probably higher-end, better quality fondue restaurants out there, but Fondue Cowboy is super affordable, fun, and terrific for groups.

Scrambling, I used my handy-dandy Open Table app on my iPhone to search for restaurants in the area that had reservations. Fondue Cowboy showed up and I made the decision to take the plunge.\n\nWhen we arrived (at 7pm) it was pretty quiet. It's a rather small space with dark interior, a faux straw floor and sleek tables. All that with cowboy movies playing in the background. The menu is fairly simple, a choice of 4-5 cheese fondues, a similar number of chocolate fondues, some salads and meat plates. \n\nSince their were four of us, we opted for 2 salads and two cheese fondues to share. We got the white bean salad and mixed greens, and the white bean was definitely our favorite. Flavorful with a bit of tan from the picked red onions. The cheese fondues we opted for were the Desperado which had goat cheese and The Outloaw, a cheddar and jalapeno cheese mix. The Desperado was definitely the favorite. More flavorful and went really well with the side dish of cornichons, olives, broccoli and grapes. The Outlaw was good but we expected more of a kick from the jalapenos. It went really well with the bread and potatoes, tho.\n\nFor dessert we got the Happy Trails (dark chocolate and cayenne) and Buck-A-Roo (milk chocolate and walnuts) to share. These came with chocolate bread, marshmallows, madeleine cookies, as well as strawberries, bananas, and grapes. They were both delicious, especially the Happy Trails - but super rich. In hindsight, we probably should've only ordered one, but you live and you learn.\n\nI'm so glad I finally came to this place.

Got news that a new fondue joint was opening up in the City and was super excited-not only of the fondue but because it was cowboy themed!  The menu was pretty small but to the point.  It's a fondue restaurant so aside from 4-5 side dishes (mainly salads), everything else was fondue-either cheese or chocolate.  The interior was designed very well.  \n\nMy friends and I were here on a Tuesday evening and at 8:15pm, they tell us they are out of chocolate!!! WHAT?!!?  (& please keep in mind that we ordered our chocolate fondue with our cheese fondue at the beginning & the waiter says he'll order it later so that it can come after the cheese-but we had to ask and order again after all and now there was none left!) For goodness sakes, that's half your menu!!!!  People come here for fondue and you run out of chocoalte?!  That is like going to the bathroom and running out of toilet paper!  What's your other option? Water and your hands!  Imagine that. That's pretty much how I felt during my experience that I was SO looking forward to.   The group to the right of us were SUPER disappointed that after they were savoring their cheese fondues, they couldn't even have the option to try the chocolate fondue.  \n\nThe group to the left of us was told they were being given the last of the chocolate they had for the evening and they ended up complaining that it was \"weird\" \"clumpy\" and \"not creamy.\"  The waiter just told them \"sorry it must have been because it was the last of it and maybe they didn't have enough half and half either.\"  WHY would you tell your customers that AFTER you've served it to them?  Did you think you could get away with it?  Obviously not...\n\nFirst off, the portion size was pretty small.  We ordered the Outlaw, which was the better of the two we ordered.  We also ordered the Stagecoach, but it was so bitter it was almost inedible.  We just pushed it aside.  There was nothing spectacular here.\n\nThe service was poor as well.  The food took a long time to come out.  There was one guy running around doing everything looking disheveled.  We had to ask multiple times just to get water refilled.  Also, when he first served the accompaniments, he only served one saying that for lack of space on the table, he would bring the other later.  By the time he brought the other, there was no cheese left & the other one was inedible.  Our server didn't seem to know how to manage his tasks.  He was nowhere to be found everytime we needed something.  It didn't look like any co-workers were helping either.  There was a few minutes when there were no servers on the floor. \n\nIt's too bad because there aren't many fondue places to go to in the City and they really could have capitalized on a unique business idea.  If they stock their ingredients correctly and train their servers properly,  this place has the potential to thrive.  Unfortunately during my visit, both service and product were lacking.  I was lucky that I had great company, which saved the whole experience. \n\nI don't think I would come here again, nor recommend it to anyone.", "rating": 2, "date": "2010-06-23"}, {"excerpts": ["We ordered the Traditional, Outlaw and Rawhide.

The fire started less than 24 hours after my sister and I finished our dinner at Fondue Cowboy.  Even I would say that's just a little suspicious.\n\nWe made a reservation for 7 pm and showed up a few minutes early.  We had a choice of 2 tables, and we opted for the one closest to the kitchen.  There was nothing unusual about the table, except for a settee-like bench on the right, separating our table from a wooden barrel with an old saddle on top.  Yep, business as usual.  The LCD TV hanging behind the bar showed old westerns, and the walls were covered with wood.  It's as if an old saloon woke up and one day and decided to be \"metro.\"  I liked it.\n\nMy last fondue experience was at The Melting Pot (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-melting-pot-san-mateo#hrid:WOkgHqb1R8Bfq-8KBo4xiA).  I enjoyed it immensely, despite the fact it was an overpriced, mass produced fondue.  Come on, people: it's dipping stuff in cheese, hot oil and chocolate.  Who doesn't love it?  I was hoping for a more sophisticated experience at Fondue Cowboy, and I am happy to say: mission accomplished.\n\nWe ordered 2 salads to start: the white bean salad and the roasted beet salad.  The salads were light and refreshing, with just the right amount of dressing.  It's amazing how much you get for $8, and I would have been totally happy splitting the salad.  It's big enough for two.  We then ordered The Outlaw, which, according to Yelp, was the way to go.

We had plenty of stuff to dip: (bread, mushrooms, olives, pickles, broccoli, grapes, apples, fingerling potatoes).  I also opted for the $8 sausage plate.  It was a thinly sliced andouille sausage, and it was delicious. $8 was a bit aggressive for one sausage though.   Aside from olives, everything else tasted surprisingly great.  Our waiter (the owner?) informed us that he could bring us more veggies, but what we needed was more cheese.  Perhaps we didn't do a good job of dipping, but we had veggies left after the cheese was long.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a High Noon fondue, which was a white chocolate fondue with balsamic strawberry puree.  It tasted like strawberry compote to me, but I am sure the chef knows best.  For our dipping pleasure, we had a variety of fruit (strawberries, kiwi, bananas and mandarin slices), as well as a less healthy plate of cut p chocolate loaf, Madeleines, and homemade marshmallows.  Aside from being almost too sweet, it was a perfect way to end an evening of dipping.\n\nServe fondue in slightly bigger ramekins (is that what those things are called?), and you've got yourself a repeat customer.

The portions are petite, about 4 ounces a pot with a large variety of included dippers.  Great place for fondue tapas snacks with draft wine.  The sweet fondue was just the right size, but the savory left me wanting for more.  Many of the dippers remained undipped due to inadequate cheese.\n\nThe Outlaw: Pretty soupy for fondue, was difficult getting the cheese to cling to any dipper except the bread.  Tasty but bordered too closely to a nacho dip with the tomatoes, garlic, cilantro and jalape\u00f1os.  Would have preferred that they steer towards a cheddar & ale Welsh rarebit since this incarnation of the cheddar was not that sophisticated.\n\nThe Stage Coach: AWESOME!  I could have easily ate a gallon of this.  Compte is such a brilliant cheese choice because of it's like the traditional fondue gruy\u00e8re, but with more personality.  I think there were some well paired mushrooms in it too.  Perfect consistency for any dipper.\n\nDippers for Savory Fondue: The whole grain bread and roasted small potatoes worked well.  The raw broccoli was a bit overpowering, even when smothered in cheese.  Apples and grapes were provided, not my thing but I suppose others like them.\n\nCured Meats Platter: Wish they skipped the melons and gave more meat.  Already enough fruit in the standard dipper selection.  The meats were prosciutto and thinly sliced salamis.  The cheese overpowered their subtlety, probably would have been better to have some cooked sausages like chorizo or kielbasa for a meatier side dish. \n\nHappy Trails: The cayenne had a bit of a kick in the first dip, but faded into the heavy dark chocolate pool afterwards.  Was very creamy for dark chocolate, but kept the bitter cocoa bite.  Seemed more like dark chocolate custard as opposed to melted dark chocolate, perhaps they need to ease up on the half-n-half.\n\nDippers for Sweet Fondue: The freshly sliced fruit was a win - strawberries, bananas and bing cherries.  The chocolate bread wasn't that chocolaty, which is actually good else it would have been overkill.  I wasn't keen on the regular bread since that's just weird in chocolate.

The cheese fondue had good flavor with mushrooms adding a nice richness to the cheese.  The dippers were eh, and included a lot of filling carbs - bread, both regular and toasted, potatoes, apples, broccoli, pickles, and olives.  We also ordered a CURED MEAT PLATTER ($16), which was a spicy tasty selection of 3 thinly sliced meats with honeydew and cantaloupe.  Thank goodness we had the salad and the meat to go with all that cheese dipped bread.  \n\nWe opted to not get a chocolate fondue for dessert, as it would be an additional $16 to an already expensive meal, given what it was.

It's a small spot, and it was full for dinner, but there didn't seem to be a wait.\n\nSERVICE\nWe didn't love our server. As a group of six, it was important to us how many meatballs were in the Homemade Meatballs side. She said twelve - which is perfect! Two each. After we got the meatballs, we realized we were one short. We half jokingly brought it up to her, saying there were only 11 in our dish. No smile, barely any acknowledgement - she just asked, \"So do you want another order of the meatballs?\" My friend joked \"Only if there are 12,\" at which our table laughed. Again, no smile from the server, just \"So do you want another order?\" Man, so cold! I understand that picking over one single meatball is not a big deal, but she could've had a bit of a sense of humor, or acknowledged her misinformation to our group.\n\nCOST\n$197.06 before tip, split six ways. We got a couple drinks, 3 fondue pots, and 3 sides. \n\nSIDES\nSpicy Sausage was the best - juicy, and legit spicy. The meatballs were a bit dry. The sliced meat were a nice extra option to wrap around the bread or potatoes and dip in to your cheese. \n\nSAVORY FONDUE\nWe got the Rawhide (Gorgonzola), Desperado (Goat Cheese), and Outlaw (Cheddar). The Gorgonzola was the most flavorful, Cheddar the most bland. All were melted to a nice balance of thickness without being watery.

"], "author": "Amy L.", "review": "I have a complicated relationship with food.  Those who know me know I have a LOT of food allergies, and this often impedes my ability to fully enjoy and appreciate certain cuisine.  This restaurant is a hard place for someone like me to eat:  between the raw fruits and veggies and the fact that there's garlic in EVERY fondue (unless you order it without, which they can do!), it's one culinary hazard after another!\n\nI'll be honest with you:  Fondue isn't my thing, at least not as a main course.  I would've never sought out this restaurant on my own, but came here as part of a large group for a close friend's birthday.  So please take what I have to say about the cheese fondue with a grain of salt.\n\nI found the cheese fondue here to be incredibly bland, probably because it was garlic-free.  My partner and I split two different fondues:\n\nFirst we tried The Traditional ($18, Swiss Gruyere, Ementhaller, White Wine, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us), Fresh Ground Nutmeg).  Gruyere is my favorite cheese and I LOVE nutmeg in my creamy/cheesy sauces, so this seemed like it should be a no-brainer for me...but I found it intensely bland.  And of the items that were available to dip in it, the only two items that I a) wasn 't allergic to, or b) didn't hate (gerkins, olives) wound up being raw broccoli and bland pieces of bread (my partner tried the roasted potatoes that came with it as well, but I couldn't eat these because they, too, were cooked in garlic oil).\n\nThe second cheese fondue we tried was The Rawhide ($18;  Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us)).  While both of us agreed that this was the better of the two fondues we ordered, it still didn't have tons of flavor and seemed to be overwhelmed by the Emmenthaler...in fact, it didn't taste too terribly different from the first fondue we tried.  It was vastly improved, though, by adding copious amounts of salt...!\n\nDessert was a huge hit for me:  We ordered the Happy Trails ($16; Dark Chocolate with Cayenne).  At my request, they left out the cayenne, since I am not a fan of pepper, and only brought us grapes and bananas for the fruit (I'm allergic to their other fruit offerings).  My favorite things to dip into the delicious chocolate turned out to be the chocolate bread (!!!!) and madeleines...very tasty!!!\n\nSo if I was generally underwhelmed by 2/3 of my dinner, why am I giving this place 4 stars?  The service was AWESOME.  They were attentive, responsive, polite, and friendly.  They catered to my special requests without batting an eyelash.  The food arrived in a timely fashion, the mixed drinks we ordered were delicious and well-balanced, and the ambiance was warm, inviting, and cozy.  It was a relatively quiet restaurant, which was really nice for conversation with my friends, and the seats were super-comfortable, especially for a big-butted woman like me.  \n\nIt's not Fondue Cowboy's fault that I'm not really into fondue...and if someone invited me to go here with them for dinner sometime, I wouldn't hesitate to say yes.  After all, a restaurant is more than just the food:  it's about the experience, which I'd say is a good one here.", "rating": 4, "date": "2013-07-31"}, {"excerpts": ["Old John Wayne cowboy movies on a big screen TV behind the bar is about the only thing cowboy about this place, The cheese fondue selection is surprisingly diverse distinctive Western names of savory fondue like Outlaw, Stage Coach, Rawhide & Desperado.\n\n", "a sharp, rich nutty pool of Swiss-only cheeses (Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental), white wine and nutmeg\n\nOutlaw ~ $24 robust mix of cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro\n\nRawhide ~ $24 Italian Dolce Gorgonzola and Emmenthaler gives it a nice kick, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic\n\n", "a sharp, rich nutty pool of Swiss-only cheeses (Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental), white wine and nutmeg\n\nOutlaw ~ $24 robust mix of cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro\n\nRawhide ~ $24 Italian Dolce Gorgonzola and Emmenthaler gives it a nice kick, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic\n\n"], "author": "Maria M.", "review": "The farthest thing on my mind was associating a European dish with cowboys.

Scrambling, I used my handy-dandy Open Table app on my iPhone to search for restaurants in the area that had reservations.

The menu is fairly simple, a choice of 4-5 cheese fondues, a similar number of chocolate fondues, some salads and meat plates. \n\nSince their were four of us, we opted for 2 salads and two cheese fondues to share.

Those who know me know I have a LOT of food allergies, and this often impedes my ability to fully enjoy and appreciate certain cuisine.  This restaurant is a hard place for someone like me to eat:  between the raw fruits and veggies and the fact that there's garlic in EVERY fondue (unless you order it without, which they can do!), it's one culinary hazard after another!\n\nI'll be honest with you:  Fondue isn't my thing, at least not as a main course.  I would've never sought out this restaurant on my own, but came here as part of a large group for a close friend's birthday.  So please take what I have to say about the cheese fondue with a grain of salt.\n\nI found the cheese fondue here to be incredibly bland, probably because it was garlic-free.  My partner and I split two different fondues:\n\nFirst we tried The Traditional ($18, Swiss Gruyere, Ementhaller, White Wine, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us), Fresh Ground Nutmeg).  Gruyere is my favorite cheese and I LOVE nutmeg in my creamy/cheesy sauces, so this seemed like it should be a no-brainer for me...but I found it intensely bland.  And of the items that were available to dip in it, the only two items that I a) wasn 't allergic to, or b) didn't hate (gerkins, olives) wound up being raw broccoli and bland pieces of bread (my partner tried the roasted potatoes that came with it as well, but I couldn't eat these because they, too, were cooked in garlic oil).\n\nThe second cheese fondue we tried was The Rawhide ($18;  Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us)).  While both of us agreed that this was the better of the two fondues we ordered, it still didn't have tons of flavor and seemed to be overwhelmed by the Emmenthaler...in fact, it didn't taste too terribly different from the first fondue we tried.  It was vastly improved, though, by adding copious amounts of salt...!\n\nDessert was a huge hit for me:  We ordered the Happy Trails ($16; Dark Chocolate with Cayenne).  At my request, they left out the cayenne, since I am not a fan of pepper, and only brought us grapes and bananas for the fruit (I'm allergic to their other fruit offerings).  My favorite things to dip into the delicious chocolate turned out to be the chocolate bread (!!!!) and madeleines...very tasty!!!\n\nSo if I was generally underwhelmed by 2/3 of my dinner, why am I giving this place 4 stars?  The service was AWESOME.  They were attentive, responsive, polite, and friendly.  They catered to my special requests without batting an eyelash.  The food arrived in a timely fashion, the mixed drinks we ordered were delicious and well-balanced, and the ambiance was warm, inviting, and cozy.  It was a relatively quiet restaurant, which was really nice for conversation with my friends, and the seats were super-comfortable, especially for a big-butted woman like me.  \n\nIt's not Fondue Cowboy's fault that I'm not really into fondue...and if someone invited me to go here with them for dinner sometime, I wouldn't hesitate to say yes.

Love the simple concept of this restaurant, a hip little place in Soma which manages to bring a modern angle to this traditional cuisine.\n\nOld John Wayne cowboy movies on a big screen TV behind the bar is about the only thing cowboy about this place, The cheese fondue selection is surprisingly diverse distinctive Western names of savory fondue like Outlaw, Stage Coach, Rawhide & Desperado.\n\nA variety of dipping items for the fondue are a diverse and crunchy selection of  baguette squares, roasted fingerling potato, broccoli florets, black grapes, black olives,  green apples and pickles. I don't eat pickles but I love eating these pickles and dipping it into the different fondue.\n\nLove how the fondue is served in these cute colorful cast-iron chafing pots over a hot blue flame that keeps the wonderful melted cheese bubbling and warm.  These are my favorites:\n\nThe Traditional~ $24 a sharp, rich nutty pool of Swiss-only cheeses (Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental), white wine and nutmeg\n\nOutlaw ~ $24 robust mix of cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro\n\nRawhide ~ $24 Italian Dolce Gorgonzola and Emmenthaler gives it a nice kick, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic\n\nAnd if you think you have already been treated to a decadent meal it hasn't ended yet.  You have a choice of sweet sinful treats ~ $20 like  Happy Trails which is Dark Chocolate with Cayenne, the Buck-A-Roo ~Milk Chocolate and High Noon ~White Chocolate.  All are tempting but I have never had space for dessert.  So I must come in one day just for the sweet fondue.  They also have salads but I can eat a salad anywhere so I want to reserve all the space to stuff myself with  rich warm gooey melted cheese!\n\nGreat place for conversation and connection.

The fire started less than 24 hours after my sister and I finished our dinner at Fondue Cowboy.  Even I would say that's just a little suspicious.\n\nWe made a reservation for 7 pm and showed up a few minutes early.  We had a choice of 2 tables, and we opted for the one closest to the kitchen.  There was nothing unusual about the table, except for a settee-like bench on the right, separating our table from a wooden barrel with an old saddle on top.  Yep, business as usual.  The LCD TV hanging behind the bar showed old westerns, and the walls were covered with wood.  It's as if an old saloon woke up and one day and decided to be \"metro.\"  I liked it.\n\nMy last fondue experience was at The Melting Pot (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-melting-pot-san-mateo#hrid:WOkgHqb1R8Bfq-8KBo4xiA).  I enjoyed it immensely, despite the fact it was an overpriced, mass produced fondue.  Come on, people: it's dipping stuff in cheese, hot oil and chocolate.  Who doesn't love it?  I was hoping for a more sophisticated experience at Fondue Cowboy, and I am happy to say: mission accomplished.\n\nWe ordered 2 salads to start: the white bean salad and the roasted beet salad.  The salads were light and refreshing, with just the right amount of dressing.  It's amazing how much you get for $8, and I would have been totally happy splitting the salad.  It's big enough for two.  We then ordered The Outlaw, which, according to Yelp, was the way to go.  The Outlaw features melted aged cheddar with a splash of beer, a hint of roasted garlic and tomatoes, as well as a dash of cilantro.  It had a very unique flavor, which made dipping stuff in cheese far more sophisticated.  We had plenty of stuff to dip: (bread, mushrooms, olives, pickles, broccoli, grapes, apples, fingerling potatoes).  I also opted for the $8 sausage plate.  It was a thinly sliced andouille sausage, and it was delicious. $8 was a bit aggressive for one sausage though.   Aside from olives, everything else tasted surprisingly great.  Our waiter (the owner?) informed us that he could bring us more veggies, but what we needed was more cheese.  Perhaps we didn't do a good job of dipping, but we had veggies left after the cheese was long.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a High Noon fondue, which was a white chocolate fondue with balsamic strawberry puree.  It tasted like strawberry compote to me, but I am sure the chef knows best.  For our dipping pleasure, we had a variety of fruit (strawberries, kiwi, bananas and mandarin slices), as well as a less healthy plate of cut p chocolate loaf, Madeleines, and homemade marshmallows.

The fire started less than 24 hours after my sister and I finished our dinner at Fondue Cowboy.  Even I would say that's just a little suspicious.\n\nWe made a reservation for 7 pm and showed up a few minutes early.  We had a choice of 2 tables, and we opted for the one closest to the kitchen.  There was nothing unusual about the table, except for a settee-like bench on the right, separating our table from a wooden barrel with an old saddle on top.  Yep, business as usual.  The LCD TV hanging behind the bar showed old westerns, and the walls were covered with wood.

I enjoyed it immensely, despite the fact it was an overpriced, mass produced fondue.  Come on, people: it's dipping stuff in cheese, hot oil and chocolate.  Who doesn't love it?  I was hoping for a more sophisticated experience at Fondue Cowboy, and I am happy to say: mission accomplished.\n\nWe ordered 2 salads to start: the white bean salad and the roasted beet salad.  The salads were light and refreshing, with just the right amount of dressing.  It's amazing how much you get for $8, and I would have been totally happy splitting the salad.  It's big enough for two.  We then ordered The Outlaw, which, according to Yelp, was the way to go.  The Outlaw features melted aged cheddar with a splash of beer, a hint of roasted garlic and tomatoes, as well as a dash of cilantro.  It had a very unique flavor, which made dipping stuff in cheese far more sophisticated.  We had plenty of stuff to dip: (bread, mushrooms, olives, pickles, broccoli, grapes, apples, fingerling potatoes).  I also opted for the $8 sausage plate.  It was a thinly sliced andouille sausage, and it was delicious. $8 was a bit aggressive for one sausage though.   Aside from olives, everything else tasted surprisingly great.  Our waiter (the owner?) informed us that he could bring us more veggies, but what we needed was more cheese.  Perhaps we didn't do a good job of dipping, but we had veggies left after the cheese was long.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a High Noon fondue, which was a white chocolate fondue with balsamic strawberry puree.  It tasted like strawberry compote to me, but I am sure the chef knows best.  For our dipping pleasure, we had a variety of fruit (strawberries, kiwi, bananas and mandarin slices), as well as a less healthy plate of cut p chocolate loaf, Madeleines, and homemade marshmallows.  Aside from being almost too sweet, it was a perfect way to end an evening of dipping.\n\nServe fondue in slightly bigger ramekins (is that what those things are called?), and you've got yourself a repeat customer.

It's hard to go wrong with bowls of melted cheese, but the masterful pairings of the cheeses with the other added ingredients was what took it to the next level.  I would've ate the fondue by the spoonful, except the table setting didn't included spoons--perhaps to protect impulsive individuals like myself from cheese overload.  Each order of fondue came with bread, potatoes, Gherkins, broccoli, grapes, and apples.\n\nWe ended our meal with the Buck-A-Roo--milk chocolate fondue with walnuts.  Into the delicious melted chocolate goodness, we dipped various fruits, chocolate bread, marshmallows and madeleines.  \n\nEverything tasted great and we left full to the gills.  They'll give you more dipping items and we asked for extras for both the cheese and chocolate fondues!    \n\nThe western theme decor and ambiance was really cool; the old black and white western movie playing on silent behind the bar was a nice touch too.  All in all, great fondue experience.  I would definitely come again, but probably to their happy hour as it can get pretty pricy.

The fire started less than 24 hours after my sister and I finished our dinner at Fondue Cowboy.

There was nothing unusual about the table, except for a settee-like bench on the right, separating our table from a wooden barrel with an old saddle on top.  Yep, business as usual.  The LCD TV hanging behind the bar showed old westerns, and the walls were covered with wood.  It's as if an old saloon woke up and one day and decided to be \"metro.\"  I liked it.\n\nMy last fondue experience was at The Melting Pot (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-melting-pot-san-mateo#hrid:WOkgHqb1R8Bfq-8KBo4xiA).  I enjoyed it immensely, despite the fact it was an overpriced, mass produced fondue.  Come on, people: it's dipping stuff in cheese, hot oil and chocolate.  Who doesn't love it?  I was hoping for a more sophisticated experience at Fondue Cowboy, and I am happy to say: mission accomplished.\n\nWe ordered 2 salads to start: the white bean salad and the roasted beet salad.  The salads were light and refreshing, with just the right amount of dressing.  It's amazing how much you get for $8, and I would have been totally happy splitting the salad.  It's big enough for two.  We then ordered The Outlaw, which, according to Yelp, was the way to go.  The Outlaw features melted aged cheddar with a splash of beer, a hint of roasted garlic and tomatoes, as well as a dash of cilantro.  It had a very unique flavor, which made dipping stuff in cheese far more sophisticated.  We had plenty of stuff to dip: (bread, mushrooms, olives, pickles, broccoli, grapes, apples, fingerling potatoes).  I also opted for the $8 sausage plate.  It was a thinly sliced andouille sausage, and it was delicious. $8 was a bit aggressive for one sausage though.   Aside from olives, everything else tasted surprisingly great.  Our waiter (the owner?) informed us that he could bring us more veggies, but what we needed was more cheese.  Perhaps we didn't do a good job of dipping, but we had veggies left after the cheese was long.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a High Noon fondue, which was a white chocolate fondue with balsamic strawberry puree.  It tasted like strawberry compote to me, but I am sure the chef knows best.  For our dipping pleasure, we had a variety of fruit (strawberries, kiwi, bananas and mandarin slices), as well as a less healthy plate of cut p chocolate loaf, Madeleines, and homemade marshmallows.  Aside from being almost too sweet, it was a perfect way to end an evening of dipping.\n\nServe fondue in slightly bigger ramekins (is that what those things are called?), and you've got yourself a repeat customer.
