Well, I believe it means \"the dog took a shit.\"  I wanted to study French in high school, but my parents would not have it.  \"Where will you use French?  There are far more Spanish people in America than French.\"  So, Spanish it was.  Little did they know that a year of my life would later be spent living in Montreal...a lot of good my forced Spanish classes did me there.\n\nParfois je deteste mes parents.  (Sometimes I hate my parents) ((FR))\n\nPero yo digress (But I digress...)  ((I think, in ESP))\n\nEl Tesoro means TREASURE in Spanish.  This is an understatement.  I love this place.  Their Horchatas are bad-ass.  For those who have never tried one: I believe the Latin American version is referred to as Morro (or rice-based with Cinnamon) and it goes well with any meat you can stuff down your gourd, yes, even Cabeza and Lengua  (beef head and tongue).  I love ordering Horchatas - because I expect most gringos order a Pepsi.  Their pretty countergirls always do a doubletake.  \"Yeah sweet thang, that's right...a horchata, and please don't spill anything down the side of that styrofoam cup.\" Oh, isn't styrofoam an absolute no-no?  In fact, isn't it illegal now?  Illegal or not, minus one star for not doing their part to save the world.  I suppose I could bring my own thermos or cup...but I'm a lazy bastard.  Bitching about it is how I do my part.\n\nTheir Caldo De Res (beef soup) soothes the soul on those arctic San Francisco nights (you know...when the mercury dips below 60).

It's holy mayhem...\n\nIn retrospect, learning Spanish was not the end of my world.  El perro tomo una mierda WILL NEVER SOUNDS AS SEXY AS:  le chien a pris une merde.  But that's okay...you can't get a morro horchata in Paris...at least not a good one...no matter how many times you say s'il vous plait.\n\nFeliz Navidad!", "rating": 4, "date": "2007-12-21"}], "caldo de pollo": [{"excerpts": ["We ordered two caldo de pollo soups and their special fries/nachos from Postmates.
