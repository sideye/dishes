Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. \n\nAfter seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): http://bit.ly/1NaltR6\n*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): http://bit.ly/1LUlGaS\n*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, saut\u00e9ed veggies ($18): http://bit.ly/1NNmzCD\n*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): http://bit.ly/1KI2tb0\n\nBased on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. \n\nThe Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. \n\nThe Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. \n\nThe Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. \n\nThe Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.\n\nService was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. \n\nThe Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. \n\nParking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.\n\nThe Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-09-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Crispy calamari salad - comes with a generous portion of calamari; The dressing is packed with flavor and out of this world!\n", "4.

Super tender and flavorful short rib, but, be it the meat or the other sauces, the bao ended up also being too sweet. \n\n* Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen - Definitely the most solid and tasty dish of the three, with nice springy noodles, albeit a bit plain overall in terms of toppings and accoutrements. \n\nIf you're in the area and have a hankering for Asian, this certainly isn't terrible, but trekking a little into Chinatown goes a long way.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - There's a large single step/platform to get into the restaurant, so we opted to sit outside instead, which was marginally more accessible, because the way the table legs were positioned made scooting under impossible.

I was expecting a smaller bao, kind of like peiking duck style. But this thing was more like a cross between a bao and a taco if you will. The meat was really tender and came off the bone, just like the waitress said. Even though there was a bone in it, the amount of meat they gave us was still pretty generous. The bao was very thick and doughy. The combination of the two was a disaster in my mouth. Although the meat had a decent flavor to it, the bread completely overpowered the meat, and it was difficult to swallow because it was so dry. The pickled veggies helped, but not too much. After the first bite, I ended up eating the bao and the meat separately. Even though it wasn't intended to be served that way, it tasted much better in my opinion.\n\nHar Gow -- One order comes with four har gows, but they separate the har gows into two steamers so they don't stick together. There is also a piece of lettuce between the har gows and the steamer, maybe to keep it from sticking to the steamer or for sanitary reasons perhaps? I'm not quite sure. The skin of the har gow is really thick, unlike traditional har gows. It comes very close to tasting like bao to me. The skin is very sticky, so it sticks really well to the steamer and the lettuce, and I completely destroyed one of the har gows before I even got it onto my plate. :( The prawns were huge! But, the har gows soaked in the flavor of the lettuce in the steamer, which took away even more of the authenticity of the har gows. :(\n\nShu Mai -- The most authentic dish that we ordered, in my opinion.  They were slightly smaller than the har gows, but not by much. The texture of the skin was thin, and the filling had a good pork to mushroom ratio. The mushroom is subtly more noticeable than the pork, just how I like it.\n\nGarlic Aonori Fries -- They were surprisingly good! Most likely just frozen Sysco fries with garlic aonori powder. But I'm not complaining! I could sit in front of the TV and eat these all day!\n\nZen Noodle Soup -- The waitress said this dish is one of the few dishes that the owner bought over from the previous restaurant due to is popularity.

The shrimp was a bit overcooked, but that's usually the case when you order shrimp with a soup. They were very generous with the mussels, and it was probably the best part of the dish. The mussels were on the smaller side, but I guess the amount they gave us made up for it.\n\nWasabi Ale -- Not my cup of ale. Very interesting taste.

I really wanted to like it because of how unique it was, but my taste buds said no. :( My friend enjoyed it, so I just let him drink all of it.\n\nThe place is pretty small.

The choices vary by certain Asian cuisines, such as Thai or Vietnamese. Some also appear to be more Asian fusion as well.\n\nThe space is pretty limited and has a communal table.

Making it a cute little destination to stop by while exploring the area or perhaps before grabbing ice cream at Humphry Slocombe or Dynamo Donuts.\n\nSpice Jar is quite the small restaurant with capacity for around 15-17 tables including indoor and outdoor seating. The indoors is quite lovely with interesting light arrangements above their wooden tree-emulating tables. The orangey yellow dim but not too dim lighting make it a romantic spot but also a nice place to come to with family or friends! I feel right at cozy home when I walk in. \n\nIt can get quite busy here even on a random weekday night so I would call ahead to see. The waiters and waitresses are super nice, just a little busy sometimes. They give a family like vibe *but I am unsure of their relations haha*\n\nAs for food, it is quite phenomenal here! I love love it. True to their name, Spice Jar dishes are packed with flavors and I lay there floored by their food . A few... maybe a lot... that I have tried are as follows:\n\nEdamame (~$6) - covered in garlic and spice, I'm IN LOVE. I would not skip out on this especially as the portion size is a bit ridiculously large. Our table of 3 had leftovers.. a rare occurrence with edamame haha.\n\nFries ($6) - delicious thin fries covered in herbs with a clean feeling. Def have had better but also these hit the spot and as a potato addict I wouldn't skip out on these either\n\nSpice Jar Fried Rice ($14) - so I for one never get fried rice at restaurants cus PFT I can make that at home. But honestly it is so good here! With shrimp and chicken woven throughout the veggie packed fried rice, the flavor can't be beat. And interestingly enough, it's not salty. I think it attests to how they create great dishes with their unique spices!\n\nLaksa ($14) - MMMMMMMM. Is all I can say. Haha I love their laksa here. Flavor punch throughout. Thinnish just right noodles. All with some delicious dry tofu and chicken. Which I'm a fan of. If you like meaty dishes tho, maybe get something else because I found myself digging for some chicken that was on the dryish side.\n\nTonkatsu Ramen ($14) - the most meh dish of them all. Packed with flavor but the noodles are just like my shin ramen noodles and they get very puffy pretty quickly. Comes with a good chunk of Pork Belly but the meat in this is pretty good not great!

I was quite excited to try the Spice Jar given the glowing reviews and proximity to SFGH. \n\nA lot of fusion nowadays seems to be very hit-or-miss: either they have found the perfect balance and creatively synergized diverse cuisines, or it dilutes the wholesomeness of the original dish in a lackluster (though usually good-looking) concoction. \n\nThe Spice Jar features a menu of selected classics from Asian cuisine.

It turned out quite underwhelming from both a hard-core ramen enthusiast and an open-minded fusion enthusiast perspective. The tonkotsu broth was quite salty and lacked pork flavor, and its combination with shoyu made it even more diluted and rendered an indecisive, halfway-there profile. The braised spare rib had a nice fall-off-the-bone texture but not quite enough flavor. Perhaps the most anti-climactic was the hard-boiled egg. I guess my favorite part was the ample spinach. \n\nAmbiance is cozy and hip, with nice wooden tables in a cheerful, sunlit space. Something about the acoustics is off though; I was sitting across the table from friends and it was so noisy, we could hardly have a conversation. \n\nSpice Jar has a good concept as a homey, modern restaurant serving pan-Asian and fusion specialties, but the food isn't really quite there in my opinion.

Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. \n\nAfter seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): http://bit.ly/1NaltR6\n*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): http://bit.ly/1LUlGaS\n*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, saut\u00e9ed veggies ($18): http://bit.ly/1NNmzCD\n*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): http://bit.ly/1KI2tb0\n\nBased on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. \n\nThe Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. \n\nThe Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. \n\nThe Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. \n\nThe Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.\n\nService was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. \n\nThe Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. \n\nParking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.\n\nThe Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-09-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Laksa noodle soup - savory and deeply comforting & satisfying on a cold evening, made w variety of malay spices and a small amount of Japanese curry\n3.

The mushroom tempura came out cold, so I know they don't fry it when you order it. Also, there was no hint of the promised truffle salt. The gyoza was deep-fried, like they do at milk tea shops. The salmon was overcooked (not medium-rare), but otherwise seared well. The green yogurt(?) sauce it came with was unsavory, but there was furikake somewhere in the dish that was a pleasant surprise. \n\nOverall, this is a restaurant I would actively avoid. I honestly feel terrible about giving them two stars because the restaurant is fairly new and service was so wonderful, but I honestly feel cheated at the price we paid for the food we received ($35/head). There wasn't a single dish I really loved, but many dishes I wish I hadn't ordered. At the end of dinner, neither of us wanted the leftovers.\n\nI was dining with a pescetarian friend of mine, so we weren't able to order any of the recommended dishes. That might have contributed to our poor experience, but I'm a firm believer that all food on a restaurant's menu should be delicious.", "rating": 2, "date": "2017-06-01"}, {"excerpts": ["Hands down for the Mongolian dishes and the Laksa dish with coconut milk noodles with shrimps & tofu, they were simply delicious and very flavorful! \n", "The roti bread with curry was a little bit too much on the oily side but the curry dip was very good.\n", "To finish our dinner we all shared a small jar of their coconut rice pudding, I can just say that it wasn't my last time eating this, I'll so get it again next time I eat there! \n", "I'll be back!

Spice Jar is tucked away in a residential neighborhood b.w. the Mission & Potrero Hill but near the hustle and bustle of 24th Street. Making it a cute little destination to stop by while exploring the area or perhaps before grabbing ice cream at Humphry Slocombe or Dynamo Donuts.\n\nSpice Jar is quite the small restaurant with capacity for around 15-17 tables including indoor and outdoor seating. The indoors is quite lovely with interesting light arrangements above their wooden tree-emulating tables. The orangey yellow dim but not too dim lighting make it a romantic spot but also a nice place to come to with family or friends! I feel right at cozy home when I walk in. \n\nIt can get quite busy here even on a random weekday night so I would call ahead to see. The waiters and waitresses are super nice, just a little busy sometimes. They give a family like vibe *but I am unsure of their relations haha*\n\nAs for food, it is quite phenomenal here! I love love it. True to their name, Spice Jar dishes are packed with flavors and I lay there floored by their food . A few... maybe a lot... that I have tried are as follows:\n\nEdamame (~$6) - covered in garlic and spice, I'm IN LOVE. I would not skip out on this especially as the portion size is a bit ridiculously large. Our table of 3 had leftovers.. a rare occurrence with edamame haha.\n\nFries ($6) - delicious thin fries covered in herbs with a clean feeling. Def have had better but also these hit the spot and as a potato addict I wouldn't skip out on these either\n\nSpice Jar Fried Rice ($14) - so I for one never get fried rice at restaurants cus PFT I can make that at home. But honestly it is so good here! With shrimp and chicken woven throughout the veggie packed fried rice, the flavor can't be beat. And interestingly enough, it's not salty. I think it attests to how they create great dishes with their unique spices!\n\nLaksa ($14) - MMMMMMMM. Is all I can say. Haha I love their laksa here. Flavor punch throughout. Thinnish just right noodles. All with some delicious dry tofu and chicken. Which I'm a fan of. If you like meaty dishes tho, maybe get something else because I found myself digging for some chicken that was on the dryish side.\n\nTonkatsu Ramen ($14) - the most meh dish of them all. Packed with flavor but the noodles are just like my shin ramen noodles and they get very puffy pretty quickly. Comes with a good chunk of Pork Belly but the meat in this is pretty good not great! So if you're craving ramen like I was, maybe it's for you but it won't be amazing like some of their other dishes\n\nTL;DR @threelittlewhales (insta!)\nAmbiance 4/5\nService 4/5\nFood 5/5", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-10-18"}, {"excerpts": [", the Spice Jar fried rice would be your thang.

They usually suck and give you bubble guts.\n\nThen, you have Pan Asian restaurants that serve popular dishes from various Asian countries. Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. \n\nAfter seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): http://bit.ly/1NaltR6\n*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): http://bit.ly/1LUlGaS\n*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, saut\u00e9ed veggies ($18): http://bit.ly/1NNmzCD\n*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): http://bit.ly/1KI2tb0\n\nBased on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. \n\nThe Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. \n\nThe Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. \n\nThe Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. \n\nThe Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.\n\nService was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. \n\nThe Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. \n\nParking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.\n\nThe Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.", "rating": 3, "date": "2015-09-02"}, {"excerpts": ["Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps $18 (", "http://bit.ly/1EBSFZF)\nCooked outer, less cooked inner.
