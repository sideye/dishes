A staple particularly in This City of origin. San Francisco is considered the historic center of the economical and handy meal. How do fringe purveyors compete, with, with the legacy and with the outliers?\n\nTOMA is a huge addition to the Chestnut Street - Union Street communities of those who consider themselves connoisseurs and success stories in our Contemporary Era. When it was covered that, another, local vendor of Latino foods, had been frequented by one of our chosen, illustrious hurlers for a World Champion team of 'ballers, all was the rage, both for that singled-out provider of Fish Taco, but the lane, and its tangents, all providers of nutrition and flavor and texture, seemed to benefit: it is a challenge to arrive on time to one's Apple Store Genius Bar or Online Pickup appointment without having to step off of the curb and ride the bus stop to circumvent the words are wealthy eaters and shoppers at The Gap...\n\nTOMA took over a small insert from a former 'dog vender, which, I could never understand, how they could have possibly made a dent in the food consciousness of those just down the street serving one of the best 'burger meals in town, at Barney's, or, the greenaholics' Vegan food and juicer, The Planet Cafe (don't get me started about the 10 other eateries across a spectrum one also has to consider as you approach this hole in the wall.)\n\nThe uniqueness of TOMA is in its entire presentation of an eatery. Yes, one can gather a traditional fare down and around the corner at Los Hermanos, But, there seems to be a Fish Taco price war heating up between LH and Tacolicious: on the way up, not down, a disservice to the consumer, despite many who have deep pockets.\n\nWhat should one expect to pay for a burrito in San Francisco: any district to any degree of authenticity, substance, healthiness, cleanliness?\n\nAbout $9.\n\nAdd shrimp? Another $2.\n\nMy only complaint with TOMA: the board featuring its daily special meat option is nowhere near the main menu above the register; I had no idea I had an option other than standard fare or their signature, pre-defined burrito.\n\nYet, the staff were kind enough to provide me with a taste sample of the daily special, which was absolutely amazing.\n\nI had already committed to a pork protein which, grilled to order from a container where it had been marinating, was simply divine inside my burrito.\n\nThe size was not ginormous but it was substantial.\n\nThe beans were perfect: firm but giving to the teeth; fresh and flavorful; no extra liquid including the starchy substance one can encounter infusing a burrito.\n\nThe balance in texture, flavor, color, each ingredient layered, fresh: perfect.\n\nI am not a huge fan of any other burrito in San Francisco: consider a venn diagram to consider all burritos in San Francisco - those you may walk or drive to in your local community.\n\nThat is one interesting fact about the distribution of burritos in the San Francisco: somehow, the Illuminati of Ethnic Foods make it impossible to have real choice. Consider La Canasta, on Buchanan. They have an attitude of convenience, a constant pulse of families, au pairs, nannies, 'sitters, double parked to pickup phone orders.\n\nBurritos and pizza are in a neck and neck competition for the Lacrosse Moms and Dads as post- practice nutrition, reward and celebration substance.\n\nTOMA is hungry for success.

Anyhow, the tortilla itself was thick and too soft - to the point where I could not taste it and it kind of dissolved a bit from the liquid coming from the meat. They have special meats of the day and on Wednesdays it's carnitas. I also got a carne asada and camarones (shrimp) taco. ($3.25 each) The meat quality was great, the carne asada had large chunks of steak that was still a little rare, which I liked a lot. Shrimp and carnitas were made perfectly and well seasoned. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a carne asada quesadilla, a horchata, and a side of guacamole. He too, said the carne asada was really good. The salsa bar is limited and none of the salsas really stood out to me, they were pretty bland. The guac costs an extra dollar-something and they give it to you in a small container the same size as you would get from the salsa bar. I was disappointed to find that the guacamole was even more bland and very lacking in seasoning compared to other Mexican places I've been to.

The bowls are a similar price and came with much more stuff.\n\nHonestly, nothing really horrible to say about TOMA other than the fact that I didn't get the nicest vibe from the worker there. He was kind of blunt and slightly rude. It also kind of has a hole-in-the-wall feel to the place, which makes me automatically associate dirtiness with it, regardless of how clean the place actually is. Maybe they could amp up the decor a little bit more to make it seem more clean and welcoming.
