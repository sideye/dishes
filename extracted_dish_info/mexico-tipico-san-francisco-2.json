The fish was fresh, tender, full of flavor, & cooked to perfection.\n\nJust the right amount of dressing.  Enough to add moisture & flavor, without overpowering the tacos.  Too much would kill the whole thing.  They nailed it.\n\nAnd the lettuce?  If you told me they had just picked the lettuce from a garden in the back & shredded it 2 minutes before they filled my order, I'd totally believe it.\n\nThese tacos only reinforced my confusion as to why Guadalajara is so highly rated.\n\nMy man ordered the carne asada burrito.  He loved & inhaled it accordingly.  I did get 2 bites, & they were delicious.  There was a kick in the sauce, the steak was tender, & it was full of flavor.\n\nThe chips, however, are completely forgettable.  As are the salsas.\n\nBut the food?  Outstanding quality, freshness, & flavor.  Love, love, love.\n\n5 stars.", "rating": 5, "date": "2015-10-05"}, {"excerpts": ["We all had to compare notes about the respective situations -- pork quesadilla and fish tacos were both culprits.
