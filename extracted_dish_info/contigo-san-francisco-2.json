Maybe it was the company I went with that I felt items were slightly more expensive (by $0.50 for the tapas alone haha). \n\nAtmosphere- \nThey have a well-lit outside seating area in the back with heating lamps. The inside dining area is more dimly lit and can get loud. I think next time I'd sit at the bar.  The service was ok. I wish the servers were more interactive haha. \n\nOverall- this place could definitely be better - have more charcuterie options (get better jamon iberico). Come to experience the tapas.

"], "author": "Edna C.", "review": "I've always shyed away from tapas, since it usually entails copious amounts of decision-making for each small plate, which then rack up a daunting bill and may still leave you hungry. However I found myself quite fond of Contigo with its Tuesday special tasting menu ft. a giant pan of paella at $40/person.... First world problems solved.\n\nThe unique Spanish/Catalan flavors, combined with the fresh and sustainable sourcing in Californian spirit, in a cozy rustic space create a memorable dining adventure. I especially appreciated how all the dishes were carefully prepared with marked attention to detail in composition and quality. \n\nDespite its favorable Michelin rating, the service and atmosphere were gracious and not the least bit pretentious. One could describe it as homecooked Barcelona fine cuisine, though the Yelp brand of Spanish tapas bar speaks to its classiness. \n\n(+) Wood Oven Roasted Monterey Sardine and Avocado Toast, Pickled Onions, Smoked Salt ($3): Lol, of course there has to be avo toast in an SF restaurant. As denizens accustomed to chunky avocado toast, Contigo's version is a bit of a tease with its thin bread and light smear of avocado, used primarily to add a creamy dimension to contrast the savory sardine and sour pickled onions. The sardines are a feat in themselves, not fishy at all and not overpowered by salt or smokiness.\n\n(++) Croqueta de Jam\u00f3n Serrano ($3.50): Mmm, a crispy panko-like exterior surrounding a lusciously creamy filling, interspersed with Spanish ham. It's hard to appreciate the artisan jambon on its own the way you can focus on charcuterie board cuts, but the croquet as a whole is comfort-food tasty. Caution that the inside is really hot when it arrives, so you may want to take your sweet time on cross section pictures and such.\n\n(++) Hand Picked Dungeness Crab Salad, Chicories, Clementines, Avocado, Fennel, Lime Vinagreta ($16): Arguably among the most interesting salads I've had; it utilized the bitterness of chicory and made it very palatable by placing it in stark contrast to tangy clementines and lime vinaigrette, the earthiness of fennel, and the creaminess of pulled crab and avocado. \n\n(++) Smashed Pumpkin Tosta, Wild Mushrooms, Idiaz\u00e1bal, Baby Mustard Greens, Pepitas ($14) Although the trendiness of pumpkin is restricted to PSL season, I enjoyed the winter veggies take on toast. I think I would have liked more variety in the tasting menu than two toasts; nonetheless this turned out an excellent combination of familiar pumpkin with hearty mushrooms and rich smokey idiazabal. The hard cheese shavings are similar to Italian parmigiano reggiano, except it's made from sheep and has more zing.\n\n(+++) Seafood Paella of Jumbo Gulf Shrimp, California Rock Cod, Monterey Squid, Clams, Baby Artichokes, Saffron, Alioli: I was actually starting to get full before we even got to the paella, and then the huge pan arrived, occupying most of the table space. The paella is deliciously al dente like risotto, sauteed with a mix of saffron and tomato-based aioli. The seafood was also very generous, and the jumbo gulf shrimp were jumbo indeed. The shrimp was possibly my favorite item of the night--juicy, meaty, and a hint of peppery. Also, bonus points to the aesthetics. While paella is usually a hodgepodge, Contigo added flairs of microgreens, an artsy swirl of white sauce, and a fancy charred lemon.\n\nOverall, I think Contigo excels the most in balance; it boldly experiments with contrasting flavors which turn out surprisingly delicious. Prices are also very reasonable considering the large portions. (It's the first time in awhile we couldn't finish our food!)\n\nNote: prices listed are referenced from the regular menu. I'm not sure how they portion out the tasting menu for different numbers of people. If I were to go by myself, I wonder if I would get the same amount of food :3\n\nContigo is situated in the relatively quiet neighborhood of Noe Valley, where the small cluster of stores and restaurants is reminiscent of a quaint downtown of a smaller town--an alcove in SF where you can breathe and relax for a peaceful dinner (and find parking.)", "rating": 5, "date": "2017-01-18"}, {"excerpts": ["Wood oven roasted monterey sardine and avocado toast - the pickled onions balanced the slightly fishy sardine.

My one complaint about this is that they don't actually tell you in advance what that menu is going to be, and it changes regularly, plus it doesn't include paella (apparently Tuesdays are paella nights).  Luckily, they are super accommodating about allergies, and they sent out different dishes where necessary for my friends who were on gluten-free diets. \n\nWe were seated in the back patio area with heat lamps, and it was really nice back there!  \n\nThe menu was excellent.  A good variety of food and some standouts:\nSardine and avocado toast with pickled onion and sea salt - a sardine dish will never be a favorite of mine but surprisingly this was actually pretty good even for people who aren't in to sardines. \nCroqueta de jamon serrano - nicely done \nMelon con Jamon - yummy!

These are canned anchovies, which are salty, so not everyone will like this dish. The fillets are swimming in olive oil, so some of the saltiness is diluted. This simple presentation was a bit disappointing. Would u pay $8 for someone to open a tin can and place a small portion of the contents on a plate, then add olive oil? It would have been a much more interesting dish if they had paired them with red peppers or artichoke hearts, or with olives & cheese over toast, or with chopped tomatoes & egg over toast, like some preparations at bars in spain. Fresh anchovies (Boquerones) would have been a real treat.

I read the dish name in Spanish, so I knew there was no chicken. Customers who read the English part perhaps got confused, \"chicken broth\" would've been a better description. The soup is served in a shallow bowl, my spoon hit the bottom every time. It would have been easier to eat from a cup. There's a tasty poached egg in the middle and lots of chopped chorizo (item not listed on menu), but not much green garlic (I did see a few slivers of what looked like green onions, which is what green garlic looks like). So the description didn't match and I dislike shallow bowls.

The fish was perfectly cooked, tender & moist, and it had a thin layer \"skin\" of crispy Jamon Serrano on one side. I've had a similar dish in other places (salmon with bacon) using applewood smoked bacon instead (the flavor contrast is better).

The jamon was delicious and had a little bit of a smoky flavor.\n\nHands down the best dish of the night was the coca (flatbread) topped with wild nettles, bacon, caramelized onions and manchego cheese. The flatbread was served PIPING hot. That manchego cheese was like burning hot lava and I totally burned my tongue while trying to eat a piece. It was worth the pain because it was absolutely divine. The caramelized onions were cooked to a pulp and were nice and sweet. Bacon always makes any dish better so I'm not going to comment on the bacon.

The squid had a strange consistency and was softer than any squid I've eaten before. It was served on a bed of squid ink rice with chorizo and artichokes mixed in. The rice was really oily and heavy and the chorizo and artichokes didn't add much. I was disappointed because I like squid ink and the rice really didn't have much flavor. The albondigas were tasty and tender. I only wish that the portion was bigger!\n\nFor dessert, we split the churros with \"hot chocolate.\" The hot chocolate was more of a thick, chocolate sauce. It was rich, but not too sweet (though I don't know how you could drink it plain). Is this how Barcelona-style hot chocolate really is? It makes me want to travel to Barcelona and try a fresh cup for myself. The churros were AMAZING. Crispy and fried to perfection and lightly coated in sugar. The combination of churros and hot chocolate pair together perfectly.\n\nOverall, Contigo was an enjoyable meal, but I felt like the portions were a little small. A party of 2-3 people would be perfect. Anything larger and I feel like not everyone would get to have a taste of everything. It was cute to explore Noe Valley a little bit  (it's extremely family-oriented).

Came here with my bf on a Tuesday night for a late dinner.\n\nVenue / Service: well-lit interior and plenty of space to walk around/ sit down.  They also have outdoor seating with canopies.  Definitely didn't have a feeling of being cramped or in tight spaces, though it might have also been because we came in during a quiet time (8:30/9pm weekday). Service was pretty good- they came by frequently to check in and make sure we were done with dishes before they served the next one, waters were filled, etc.\n\nJam\u00f3n Serrano (Monte Nevado, Aged 15-20 Months, Rioja)($16) - lightly salted and still very savory!  My bf and I love jamon though this was a rather large portion of jamon; just enough bread to accompany the jamon too.\n\nWood Oven Roasted Monterey Sardine and Avocado Toast (Pickled Onions, Smoked Salt)($3.50 per toast) - huge fan of sardines and this was a pretty good toast.  Surprised that they were able to get the sardine less salty by pairing it with avocado and onions and thankfully the toast wasn't too thick.\n\nCroqueta de Jam\u00f3n Serrano (Crisp and Creamy Fritter of Spanish Serrano Ham)($3.50 per piece) - hard to go wrong with a croquette; this one was deliciously cheesy and not too much breading on the outside.  Lot of ham chunks inside too so you can really taste it!\n\nLittle Gem Salad (Roasted Beets, Garlic Chips, Mint, Sherry Mustard Vinagreta)($13) - recommended by our waitress out of the salads selection.  The mint and vinaigrette really made this salad, adding a lightness that was much needed in an otherwise somewhat-heavy meal.   \n\nSquid-Ink Seafood Paella (??) - Tuesday nights are paella night and so we ordered the special paella.  Yay for the plentiful seafood on the paella- they also included small bits of cod which I particularly liked.  Was kinda bummed that they didn't include the soccarat at the bottom of the paella, since I personally LOVE the crispy rice that you would normally find at the bottom of a paella.  The paellas are MASSIVE btw; I bet 3 people would be satisfied assuming they ordered tapas as well- we barely finished half of it.\n\nButterscotch Flan (Fresh Strawberries, Dark Chocolate-Sea Salt Cookie)($9) - loved the flan and a great way to end the meal!  Not too creamy/ heavy, and the caramel was salted a bit to cut the sweetness.\n\nLittle bit on the expensive side overall, but we were pretty satisfied with the quality of food- I'd place it as one of the top tapas places I've been to in SF so far.

We left STUFFED........ but satisfied :)\n\nTo start we started with individual mini tapas:\n\nOxtail Mini Hamburguesa ($5) - I've never had oxtail meat before but was pleasantly surprised! Braised oxtail meat just melts in your mouth! The meat was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor! But just a warning - you get one tiny hamburger that you can literally fit in one bite!\n\nCreamy Dungeness Crab Croqueta ($5) - delicious ball of crab meat, breaded and fried to perfection. The outside breading was crunchy and topped with a spicy sauce which complimented the creamy crab!\n\nWood Oven Roasted Local Sardine and Avocado Toast ($3) - a delicious fishy dish! Avoid if you can't stand fishy flavors! But the creamy avocado spread and smokey flavor evens out the sardine.\n\nNext came the bigger dishes called Raciones - plates for sharing:\n\nLittle gem salad ($11) - talk about fresh ingredients! Some of the most delicious and flavorful beets I've never had! Topped with flavor bombs = GARLIC CHIPS! Yum! The sherry mustard vinaigrette is a bit overpowering - so avoid if you like  sour flavors! \n\nPatates Braves ($8) - gotta have some carbs! A dish of crispy fried potatoes topped with a spicy salsa brava sauce. Generous portions - we couldn't finish this one!\n\nLocal calamars a la planxa ($11) - grilled calamari served on a bed of brussel sprouts kept piping hot on a steel plate. The salty calamari and capers paired perfectly with the hints of sweetness from the currants. Definitely would recommend this dish! \n\nSeared Hawaiian Ahi Tuna ($22) - by far my favorite dish of the night! 4 pieces of seared ahi tuna placed on top of a creamy celery root. The tuna was topped with broccoli and a oxtail broth was poured tableside. The tuna was seasoned delicately so that you could still enjoy the freshness of the fish but the seared skin was salty. For some reason me and my friend kept tasting something slightly sweet also, but couldn't put our finger on it. Either way - it blew us away!

The flatbread was served PIPING hot. That manchego cheese was like burning hot lava and I totally burned my tongue while trying to eat a piece. It was worth the pain because it was absolutely divine. The caramelized onions were cooked to a pulp and were nice and sweet. Bacon always makes any dish better so I'm not going to comment on the bacon.

The rice was really oily and heavy and the chorizo and artichokes didn't add much. I was disappointed because I like squid ink and the rice really didn't have much flavor. The albondigas were tasty and tender. I only wish that the portion was bigger!\n\nFor dessert, we split the churros with \"hot chocolate.\" The hot chocolate was more of a thick, chocolate sauce.

He explained that it was a favorite neighborhood eatery of his, so in an effort to do as the natives do, I made reservations for dinner at 5:30PM on a Sunday.\n\nAMBIANCE: Cute decor/ambiance.  Although the dining space isn't very large, the open kitchen and abundance of natural light makes it seem slightly larger than it is.  I will say that seating was somewhat cramped... and why they would seat us next to the only other diners in the entire restaurant when there was plenty of open space elsewhere was a mystery.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly.  A little bit scattered at time, but overall they did a good job.\n\nFOOD: Eeehhhh... nothing stood out to me.  We ordered a few items:\n- Sardine + avocado toast ($3): Good pairing of oily fish and fatty avocado, with the pickled onion to cut through the fat.  I think I would've enjoyed this bite more if the avocado had been sliced instead of mashed to a thin paste.\n- Little gem salad ($12): Light & refreshing.  I wish there were more beets and that the garlic chips were more flavorful.  It was not worth $12.\n- Coca (flatbread; $15): The version we had had chantarelle mushrooms and some porky product, along with a divine cheese.  My fave of the items we ordered, it was essentially a fancy pizza.  The crust was delicious, with a slightly smoky flavor from the wood-fired oven (?) they baked it in.  The flavors were bold yet harmonious, and I had to stop myself from inhaling the entire thing.\n- Local xipirons (squid) a la Planxa ($14): very tender squid, but slightly bland in flavor.  J didn't care for the beans in this dish, and thought the sauce was too watery.\n- Tripe with chorizo & chickpeas ($9): VERY tender tripe.  The sauce was basically a ragout, chunky and yummy.  I wish I had some bread to eat with this dish. \n- Molasses cake ($9): basically a spiced gingerbread-y cake.  I was expecting moist decadence based on the description, so imagine my disappointment when I took a bite of extremely crumb-y DRY cake! :( BOOFACE.  However, the salted caramel sauce was a delightful pairing with the cake flavor.\n\nOVERALL: I wasn't wowed by the food, but if I lived in the neighborhood, I could see this restaurant entering my weekly rotation.  However, its not something I'd drive all the way up from the south bay for.

The small plates are meant to be shared, the soft lighting and wood invite relaxation, and our amicable waiter had the easygoing manner of the Spanish. \n\nThere's not much going on in this little stretch of neighborhood other than the neighborhood bar next door. Which unfortunately means there's not much to do while you're waiting (unless you're smart and make a reservation in advance, which I highly recommend if you want an actual table or patio seat!) other than catch a basketball game and play some pool in The Peaks Bar. \n\nStool seats at the sturdy wooden counter opened first, so that's where we two ended up sitting after a 15 minute wait. Not bad considering we came on a whim! Way before our waiter even came I was already hard at work with my iPhone, snapping pictures of EVERYTHING because the whole setup is so picturesque. The stiff linen napkins, blooming red tulips... You can bet when I discovered the outdoor patio and the charming bathroom that I wished I had taken my phone with me on the short journey. The bathroom isn't one of those sterile, polished places - it feels more like a country cottage with its nature-y paint and wooden pallets under the toilet and sink. Contigo is the kind of place where everything has its place, from the decorative mortar and pestle pieces to the defined role of each cook. There's even someone solely dedicated to wiping completed plates clean before setting them out for the waiters (you can tell I took major advantage of the people watching). \n\nOkay, onto the meat of the matter:\n- Croquetas: we chose two crispy Jam\u00f3n Serrano croquetas that immediately jump-started our meal. It's pricy, at $3.50 for one meatball sized croquette, but the creamy-crispy combo is something you really need to try. If ham is not your thing, get a different filling! \n- Papas Braves: no bravery necessary for this saucy dish! Jokes and poor pronunciation aside, these are a Spanish favorite (also called papas bravas). Crispy-skinned potatoes for dipping in both aioli and tangy tomato salsa brava. Think  homefries, but better.\n- Tripe with Chorizo and Chickpeas: I didn't know what to expect, even after seeing it in front of me. But the sauce is a party on your tongue. The tripe makes for an interesting slippery texture (like glass noodles) and you never really know what you've scooped out of the stew until it's in your mouth.\n- Sauteed Greens Catalan style: this is not the way to go if you want bang for your buck. The greens seemed to be large leaves of spinach (or a relative) topped with pine nuts and raisins, with flavor assistance from garlic and lemon. Nothing special, would probably order a salad to get my greens next time.\n- Albondigas: these are also supposedly another Spanish classic, but the gaminess of the lamb was very much present. Texture-wise, I loved how crumbly yet juicy they were, but I think this could have been better.\n\nThe dishes here can be hit or miss, and I think as long as you like the ingredients going into the dish, you're safe.

Everything at Contigo had great execution, but after my dining experience at Coqueta, I realized Contigo was just OK (food-wise).\n\nMy friends and I came here on a Sunday night as part of our monthly food outing. Parking was actually not too bad, surprisingly. We were seated in the outdoor patio with the heated lamps. However, the heated lamps got pretty hot because it was heating our backs the whole time... Anyways, the four of us decided to share family style so we could try a little bit of everything. \n\nWood Oven Roasted Local Sardine and Avocado Toast: Really liked the texture of the toast as it added a crunch with the sardine. \n\nCoca (Flatbread) of Wild Nettles: I really liked this dish because it wasn't too cheesy nor too oily/greasy. I really liked how the crust was crispy. Felt pretty healthy just eating that.\n\nPatates Braves: I thought this dish was just OK. The potatoes were crispy and fried. However, there was a very good portion of potatoes.\n\nCharred Asparagus: Pretty interesting since it was served with egg and ham. But overall, the taste was just OK. Nothing too special.\n\nSeared Local Black Cod: One of my favorite dishes of the night. The black cod was soft and moist. \n\nMonterey Xipirons (squid) a la Planxa: Squid was pretty chewy and wasn't overcooked. I liked how it was presented over squid ink rice and chorizo. One of my other favorite dishes of the night\n\nAlbondigas: Contained pork and lamb in tomato sauce. I wasn't too big of a fan of the albondigas here.. Didn't really like the taste nor the texture.\n\nTCHO Hot Chocolate with Churros: Churros were the perfect portion size for dessert. The TCHO hot chocolate was really rich and chocolately, but complemented the churros well. However, after having almost the same dessert at Coqueta, I definitely prefer Coqueta's version of the churros with hot chocolate and mixed berries powder.", "rating": 3, "date": "2014-05-11"}, {"excerpts": ["patates braves: not sure what the sauce was, but wanted to lick the plate.\n\n"], "author": "Christine E.", "review": "Small restaurant, small plates!

The location right off 24th street in charming Noe Valley doesn't hurt either. \n\nYou simply have to order the chef's tasting menu of 7 courses for $42. It's such a freaking steal and you get the satisfaction of trying all the highlights on the menu. \n\nHere were our 7 courses: \n1. Ham croqueta: cheesy and crispy fried deliciousness. One of the better croquetas I've had in tapas restaurants.\n2. Sardine and avocado toast with pickled onions and smoked salt: Although I was a bit hesitant about sardines, this was quite possibly my favorite of the night. It was literally bursting with flavor at every bite and the texture combination of the soft avocados on top of the smooth sardine on top of the crispy toast... dear god. \n3. Arros negre (squid ink rice with squid): This was the unanimous table favorite as the squid was so plump and oozing with flavor and the rice was perfectly soaked in yummy squid ink. I'd say this was a close second to the sardine and avocado toast for me. \n4. Pork and lamb meatballs in tomato sauce: So well cooked, meaty and tender.\n5. A salad dish that I can't remember: Nothing noteworthy to write home about. It was just a salad.\n6. Patates braves: So crispy and fried to perfection. One of the best patates braves I've had!\n7. Brussel sprouts with jamon serrano, parsnip, capers and cava butter: So freaking flavorful and yummy! I could eat them all day in the wonderful sauce that the sprouts were covered in.\n8. Trout wrapped with prosciutto: The flavor profile of the fatty prosciutto piece seeping onto the perfectly seared trout with the special sauce on top... I can't even...\n\nAll in all, we were beyond impressed with the intricate detail that went into each course. Clearly, the highlights are the unique flavor profiles and intermingling of ingredients.

Every single dish was delicious, the ambiance was beautiful, and the service was excellent! Came here with a close friend and shared about 7 tapas. We left STUFFED........ but satisfied :)\n\nTo start we started with individual mini tapas:\n\nOxtail Mini Hamburguesa ($5) - I've never had oxtail meat before but was pleasantly surprised! Braised oxtail meat just melts in your mouth! The meat was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor! But just a warning - you get one tiny hamburger that you can literally fit in one bite!\n\nCreamy Dungeness Crab Croqueta ($5) - delicious ball of crab meat, breaded and fried to perfection. The outside breading was crunchy and topped with a spicy sauce which complimented the creamy crab!\n\nWood Oven Roasted Local Sardine and Avocado Toast ($3) - a delicious fishy dish! Avoid if you can't stand fishy flavors! But the creamy avocado spread and smokey flavor evens out the sardine.\n\nNext came the bigger dishes called Raciones - plates for sharing:\n\nLittle gem salad ($11) - talk about fresh ingredients! Some of the most delicious and flavorful beets I've never had! Topped with flavor bombs = GARLIC CHIPS! Yum! The sherry mustard vinaigrette is a bit overpowering - so avoid if you like  sour flavors! \n\nPatates Braves ($8) - gotta have some carbs! A dish of crispy fried potatoes topped with a spicy salsa brava sauce. Generous portions - we couldn't finish this one!\n\nLocal calamars a la planxa ($11) - grilled calamari served on a bed of brussel sprouts kept piping hot on a steel plate. The salty calamari and capers paired perfectly with the hints of sweetness from the currants. Definitely would recommend this dish! \n\nSeared Hawaiian Ahi Tuna ($22) - by far my favorite dish of the night! 4 pieces of seared ahi tuna placed on top of a creamy celery root. The tuna was topped with broccoli and a oxtail broth was poured tableside. The tuna was seasoned delicately so that you could still enjoy the freshness of the fish but the seared skin was salty. For some reason me and my friend kept tasting something slightly sweet also, but couldn't put our finger on it. Either way - it blew us away! We licked the plate clean!\n\nOverall, I had a wonderful dining experience.

It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. Had way better elsewhere. \n\nCroqueta de jamon serran-Cheese and ham filling in a crunchy ball. How can you go wrong?\n\n$25 jamon serrana ham-very expensive thinly sliced ham with some bread. This was really good. \n\nGoat cheese salad-very refreshing. They give you a big piece of goat cheese that you can cut up yourself\n\nPardon peppers-love these. They are just like the shishito peppers\n\nPatates braves-cripsy fried potatoes with yummy sauce. An upgraded version of french fries. Got to have them.\n\nChanterelle mushroom flatbread-oh so yummy and crispy crust.

I don't know if it's the tiny portions and me liking tiny things or if it's the shared plates and me liking to try a little bit of a lot of dishes, but a tapas restaurant is pretty much always a good choice for me, so I ended up picking Contigo to have my birthday dinner with friends. Not sure if reservations are usually needed/recommended since we came for an early dinner, but they take them so might as well make one in case.\n\nThe restaurant is modern and trendy but still has a cozy, intimate atmosphere. There's normal seating and bar seating inside, but my friends and I chose to sit on the patio out back. Limited seating out there though!\n\nThe menu has a good selection of tapas ranging from single bites to small plates to larger \"entree\" plates as well as beer and wine. I had done my Yelp research beforehand so I knew what I wanted, but since most of those dishes ended up being on the tasting menu for the night, we ended up just going with that. \n\nService was great! Our waiter was super friendly, energetic and very attentive. Food came out at a good pace, but each dish came out one at a time and I wish they had brought out multiple at once, but only more so for pictures than anything else.. (yes, guilty as charged)\n\nFood overall was pretty good. The tapas I loved and would recommend ended up being the ones that Yelp had recommended and that I had wanted to get in the first place: CROQUETAS, MONTEREY XIPIRONS (squid) and ALBONDIGAS (meatballs). The HALIBUT was pretty good too. The rest were mostly pretty forgettable - still really good but not special enough for me to want to order them again. If you're indecisive and/or unsure of what to order, then the tasting menu is definitely a good option! Otherwise, just skip the tasting menu and order what you actually want to try. There are definitely things on the menu I wish I had gotten instead of some things in the tasting. \n\nOur TASTING MENU ($46/person) consisted of:\n\n-GULF SHRIMP (off menu) - 3/5\nDidn't really leave an impression on me, neither good nor bad. Just normal shrimp. \n\n-CROQUETA DE JAMON SERRANO (normally $3.50 each) - 5/5\n[crisp and creamy fritter of spanish serrano ham]\nPerfectly fried! Crispy on the outside without being greasy, and creamy and savory on the inside without being too cheesy. Nice contrast of textures.\n\n-WARM DELICATA SQUASH SALAD (normally $14) - 3/5\n[chanterelles, pomegranate, fennel, frisee, shaved idiazabal]\nNothing memorable. The squash was cooked well but there was nothing special about the flavors or the salad in general. Not really worth getting.\n\n-SAMFAINA (normally $15) - 3.5/5\n[catalan autumn vegetable ratatouille, topped with farm egg]\nI love runny, undercooked eggs! Aside from that, the ratatouille was made well - veggies were tender and not too salty - but didn't really stand out much.\n\n-MONTEREY XIPIRONS (SQUID) A LA PLANXA (normally $16) - 5/5\n[arros negre, chorizo, ink, baby artichokes, allioli, guindilla chile]\nYUM. Superrr tender squid! Plump and full of flavor. I've never had squid ink before and thought it would have a more distinctive/unique taste, but while savory and tasty, the rice/ink was more normal than I expected. Also supposed to be a little spicy but I didn't feel any of the chile/heat. Definitely recommend!!\n\n-OLIVE OIL FRIED ALASKAN HALIBUT (normally $27) - 4/5\n[\"gazpacho salad\" of tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, croutons, basil allioli]\nBeautifully plated! Halibut was incredibly moist and flaky and, like the croquetas, perfectly crispy on the outside.

This would disappear with every last drop of the sauce.\n\nOur waiter was attentive in removing and bringing plates as well as refilling water and drink glasses as needed.  It was a very relaxed environment since we came before dark.  However, you'll need to order more if you are hungry or have a hearty appetite.  My friend somewhat joked about having a bowl of Thai noodle soup to finish the evening, so we compromised and went to Mitchell's for some ice cream for dessert.\nNice neighborhood spot and away from the heavy foot traffic 24th Street corridor.

I came for dinner in a group of three on a Friday night, and I found that the food and service here were both excellent, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was so welcoming and modern. \n\nAfter ordering a bottle of Bobol red wine to share, we were started off with bread and olive oil for the table. Our first dish to share was the seared goat cheese salad, which came with chicories, persimmons, apples, pomegranate, hazelnut, and a toasted crouton. This dish was absolutely delicious and perhaps one of my favorites that we tried--the salad was so lightly but perfectly dressed in a slightly acidic vinaigrette, and everything paired so well together--the freshness of the vegetables/fruit, the creaminess of the cheese, and the crunchiness of the crouton.\n\nNext, we had the oxtail hamburguesita, which was a hamburger \"patty\" made of strips of pulled, braised oxtail served with pickled onions in a bun. This dish was great, as the beef was so tender, but perhaps a tiny bit underseasoned. We also had the jamon crouquetas (fried fritter with serrano ham), which was nice and creamy, but not as hearty/savory as the name suggests. \n\nWe continued our meal with the smashed pumpkin tosta, which was basically pureed pumpkin on toast (with some other ingredients) and the espinacas con garbonzos (spinach and chickpea stew with moorish spices). Both of these dishes were decent with very clean flavors, but nothing all that mind-blowing. Finally, we finished with the squid a la plancha (also one of my favorites of the night), which was grilled calamari over roasted Brussels sprouts--the squid and the sprouts were unbelievably flavorful, and the dish also had a very nice texture to it. We also had the albondigas (the pork/lamb/jamon meatballs), which were so juicy and tender, but the tomato sauce that the meatballs were drenched it wasn't particularly flavorful and left something to be desired.\n\nOverall, Contigo offered some excellent food with clean flavors (definitely nothing too salty here, as I sometimes find in some tapas restaurants) and extremely friendly service.

Limited seating out there though!\n\nThe menu has a good selection of tapas ranging from single bites to small plates to larger \"entree\" plates as well as beer and wine.

Just normal shrimp. \n\n-CROQUETA DE JAMON SERRANO (normally $3.50 each) - 5/5\n[crisp and creamy fritter of spanish serrano ham]\nPerfectly fried! Crispy on the outside without being greasy, and creamy and savory on the inside without being too cheesy. Nice contrast of textures.\n\n-WARM DELICATA SQUASH SALAD (normally $14) - 3/5\n[chanterelles, pomegranate, fennel, frisee, shaved idiazabal]\nNothing memorable. The squash was cooked well but there was nothing special about the flavors or the salad in general. Not really worth getting.\n\n-SAMFAINA (normally $15) - 3.5/5\n[catalan autumn vegetable ratatouille, topped with farm egg]\nI love runny, undercooked eggs! Aside from that, the ratatouille was made well - veggies were tender and not too salty - but didn't really stand out much.\n\n-MONTEREY XIPIRONS (SQUID) A LA PLANXA (normally $16) - 5/5\n[arros negre, chorizo, ink, baby artichokes, allioli, guindilla chile]\nYUM. Superrr tender squid! Plump and full of flavor. I've never had squid ink before and thought it would have a more distinctive/unique taste, but while savory and tasty, the rice/ink was more normal than I expected. Also supposed to be a little spicy but I didn't feel any of the chile/heat. Definitely recommend!!\n\n-OLIVE OIL FRIED ALASKAN HALIBUT (normally $27) - 4/5\n[\"gazpacho salad\" of tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, croutons, basil allioli]\nBeautifully plated! Halibut was incredibly moist and flaky and, like the croquetas, perfectly crispy on the outside. The basil allioli was deeeeelicious!\n\n-ALBONDIGAS (normally $13) - 4/5\n[pork, lamb and jamon meatballs in tomato sherry sauce]\nMeaty, tender and juicy. Well-cooked, but I didn't find the flavor of the meatballs or the tomato sauce to be special or unique.

The small plates are meant to be shared, the soft lighting and wood invite relaxation, and our amicable waiter had the easygoing manner of the Spanish. \n\nThere's not much going on in this little stretch of neighborhood other than the neighborhood bar next door. Which unfortunately means there's not much to do while you're waiting (unless you're smart and make a reservation in advance, which I highly recommend if you want an actual table or patio seat!) other than catch a basketball game and play some pool in The Peaks Bar. \n\nStool seats at the sturdy wooden counter opened first, so that's where we two ended up sitting after a 15 minute wait. Not bad considering we came on a whim! Way before our waiter even came I was already hard at work with my iPhone, snapping pictures of EVERYTHING because the whole setup is so picturesque. The stiff linen napkins, blooming red tulips... You can bet when I discovered the outdoor patio and the charming bathroom that I wished I had taken my phone with me on the short journey. The bathroom isn't one of those sterile, polished places - it feels more like a country cottage with its nature-y paint and wooden pallets under the toilet and sink. Contigo is the kind of place where everything has its place, from the decorative mortar and pestle pieces to the defined role of each cook. There's even someone solely dedicated to wiping completed plates clean before setting them out for the waiters (you can tell I took major advantage of the people watching). \n\nOkay, onto the meat of the matter:\n- Croquetas: we chose two crispy Jam\u00f3n Serrano croquetas that immediately jump-started our meal. It's pricy, at $3.50 for one meatball sized croquette, but the creamy-crispy combo is something you really need to try. If ham is not your thing, get a different filling! \n- Papas Braves: no bravery necessary for this saucy dish! Jokes and poor pronunciation aside, these are a Spanish favorite (also called papas bravas). Crispy-skinned potatoes for dipping in both aioli and tangy tomato salsa brava. Think  homefries, but better.\n- Tripe with Chorizo and Chickpeas: I didn't know what to expect, even after seeing it in front of me. But the sauce is a party on your tongue. The tripe makes for an interesting slippery texture (like glass noodles) and you never really know what you've scooped out of the stew until it's in your mouth.\n- Sauteed Greens Catalan style: this is not the way to go if you want bang for your buck. The greens seemed to be large leaves of spinach (or a relative) topped with pine nuts and raisins, with flavor assistance from garlic and lemon. Nothing special, would probably order a salad to get my greens next time.\n- Albondigas: these are also supposedly another Spanish classic, but the gaminess of the lamb was very much present. Texture-wise, I loved how crumbly yet juicy they were, but I think this could have been better.\n\nThe dishes here can be hit or miss, and I think as long as you like the ingredients going into the dish, you're safe.

The delicata squash salad recommended by our server was delicious but only had about 3 small bits of squash in the entire salad. It could use more.

Unfortunately I don't remember the actual names of each dish, sorry, but I'll do my best to describe them.  After all, we had nine dishes while we were there. Maybe someone who works there will stumble upon this and tell me the actual names.\n\nOur first tapas was mangos with cheese. It truly was a great way to start. It was fresh, ripe, wonderful combination of the fruit and cheese. (4.5 Stars)\n\nWe moved onto toast with tomato bruschetta.  The toast was wonderfully crunchy despite the tomato spread on it. This was probably the least favorite of all the dishes, not a home run, but a double or triple. (3 Stars)\n\nI was the only one who wanted to try the monidito (sardines), which worked out well, all three for me. I was expecting a very salty piece of fish, but it was prepared in a way where it wasn't and the toast underneath helped to make the whole bite very mild. (4 Stars)\n\nNext on our palate was the albondigas (meatballs). It is pork meat balls in a tomato sherry sauce. OUT OF THE PARK HOMERUN! Wow, was this one out of two favorite dishes that night. After the meatballs were done, I was still scrapping the tomato sauce.  It was slightly spicy, just enough heat, making you want more. (6 out of 5 Stars)\n\nThe second favorite dish was the brussels sprouts. Up until this evening, I never ate brussels sprouts. This dish made me do an about-face for brussels sprouts. I now say I eat them. I feel like they blanched them before cooking them because they were cooked, yet still deliciously crunchy. It also had a lemon dressing that made you lick your lips and hoping there were some sauce on them. As a surprise, there was a layer of thinly sliced almonds underneath giving it just an additional flavor, but the right amount of texture. (5 Stars)\n\nI didn't see this one on the menu today, but if it's not, what a loss.  The next one was Pimientos de Padron (small peppers sauteed and sprinkled with sea salt). These were yummy and zero were left. I was expecting them to be spicy, but were not. They had just enough charred flavor that was complimented with the salt. (4 Stars)\n\nThe crispy potatoes arrived with a tomato dressing.  I think I would have enjoyed these more if it wasn't next to my favorite ones.  Since it was competing side-by-side, it fell to waste side. We finished them, don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but couldn't compete with the brussels sprouts and meat balls. (3 Stars)\n\nMoving onto dessert, we tried two. The first one was an ice cream dish, but I don't remember what type, once again competing side-by-side with a better dish. (3 Stars)\n\nThe dessert that left us wanting more was the chocolate caliente con churros.  These were delicious Mexican cinnamon sticks that we could dip into hot molten chocolate.

"], "author": "Jackie T.", "review": "In my quest for eating as much as possible during my last few weeks in San Francisco, I decided to venture outside my normal \"comfort zone\" all the way to Noe Valley. I can't believe I've lived in this city for over two years and have never been to Noe Valley. My supervisor had high praise for the restaurant  (she's also a foodie), plus it was another chance to check something off the 7X7  100 Things to Eat Before You Die list.\n\nMy friends and I started to meal off with the little gem salad with roasted beets and garlic chips; goat cheese salad with arugula, apples and hazelnuts; and the jamon iberico de bellota. The salads didn't really impress me much in terms of flavor combinations and they were also small. The jamon was delicious and had a little bit of a smoky flavor.\n\nHands down the best dish of the night was the coca (flatbread) topped with wild nettles, bacon, caramelized onions and manchego cheese. The flatbread was served PIPING hot. That manchego cheese was like burning hot lava and I totally burned my tongue while trying to eat a piece. It was worth the pain because it was absolutely divine. The caramelized onions were cooked to a pulp and were nice and sweet. Bacon always makes any dish better so I'm not going to comment on the bacon. I also liked how there was a little bit of kick with spicy pepper flakes on top. You have to order this dish if you go!\n\nI was surprised that the calamars a la planxa was on the 7X7 list. The squid had a strange consistency and was softer than any squid I've eaten before. It was served on a bed of squid ink rice with chorizo and artichokes mixed in. The rice was really oily and heavy and the chorizo and artichokes didn't add much. I was disappointed because I like squid ink and the rice really didn't have much flavor. The albondigas were tasty and tender. I only wish that the portion was bigger!\n\nFor dessert, we split the churros with \"hot chocolate.\" The hot chocolate was more of a thick, chocolate sauce. It was rich, but not too sweet (though I don't know how you could drink it plain). Is this how Barcelona-style hot chocolate really is? It makes me want to travel to Barcelona and try a fresh cup for myself. The churros were AMAZING. Crispy and fried to perfection and lightly coated in sugar. The combination of churros and hot chocolate pair together perfectly.\n\nOverall, Contigo was an enjoyable meal, but I felt like the portions were a little small. A party of 2-3 people would be perfect. Anything larger and I feel like not everyone would get to have a taste of everything. It was cute to explore Noe Valley a little bit  (it's extremely family-oriented). I don't think it's a restaurant that you need to go out of your way to try, but if you're in the area, Contigo is worth checking out.\n\nRead more reviews and see photos on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/spanish-and-catalan-tapas-at-contigo/", "rating": 4, "date": "2012-04-27"}, {"excerpts": ["Albondigas (AKA Pork and Jamon Meatballs) were okay.

Sadly, I should have left my excitement at home.  To call Contigo a big disappointment is unfair so we'll just leave it at . . . disappointment.\n\nWhen trying a new restaurant I like to experience as much of its cuisine as I can.  In that vein, my table and I opted for the chef's tasting menu.  For $40 per person we purportedly got the seven best dishes of the night.  If we ate the top seven, I feel bad for other patrons who ate the dishes in the bottom seventy-five percent of the menu.  I will say though that $40 per person for a comprehensive tasting menu is a good deal.\n\nOur meal started out with the arugula and strawberry salad.  The salad was balanced and tasty if you got all of the ingredients in your mouth in one bite.  If you didn't, the salad was unbalanced, a bit tart, and the strawberry flavor was misplaced.  In a continuing theme throughout the evening, or next course, the Monterey sardine on avocado toast, was brought out before we had finished our prior course (this happened with every single course).  The Monterey sardines were good if you like salty fish (which I do).  Our next dish was the beet salad which was nothing special.  The beets could have been roasted and pickled a bit more (a la Chez Panisse).   \n\nNext, we were served the Calamari with squid ink rice.  The Calamari was good but lacked a \"wow\" factor.  Following the squid was the Albondigas (pork meatballs).  These were dry and bland.  How you screw up Albondigas is beyond me but then again Contigo messed up Patatas Bravas (more on that later).  \n\nOur next course was the seared halibut which was overcooked and dry.  The sauce served with it was good but the errors in cooking the fish ruined the dish.  By this point in time our table was pretty full.  We'd had salads and we'd had proteins . . . yet strangely enough, it was at this point in time that the chef thought it was a good idea to cap our meal with a big plate of sauteed greens.  Needless to say, given that they weren't very good, all the table did was pick at it.\n\nOne of the patrons in my party, being informed that the patatas bravas was not part of our seven course meal, ordered it separately as she is a huge fan.  Unfortunately, she regretted her additional order.  The patatas bravas were cooked poorly (didn't really get the crispy exterior) and were served with an aioli more similar to sour cream and a bland romesco sauce.  Needless to say, neither she nor I was pleased with the dish.\n\nFor all you Yelpers who don't live in Noe Valley, you aren't missing anything if you don't make it to Contigo.

Went with my friend George and we were both starving after workouts and ready to eat a LOT.\n\nWe started off with a taste test between jamon serrano ($9) and jamon iberico ($21).  OK, $21 is a lot for a couple of slices of cured ham.  But it sure is delicious.  The iberico is more like a ribeye or kobe, super fatty and melt in your mouth.  The serrano is more like a ny strip, much meatier taste.  Both are great.  George preferred serrano, I preferred iberico.  But I'll prob get my iberico from Bi-rite next time.\n\nThe small tapas are $7 if you get 3 or more.  We got, in order of deliciousness:\n\n2 orders of oxtail croquettas (these are AMAZING rich croquettes, DELICIOUS)\nsnap peas and mushrooms (delicious, but you know, peas and mushrooms...)\npatatas bravas (delicious fried potatoes with OK sauce)\nbutter beans w/ chorizo/pig's ear/trotter (basically fancy pork and beans, except with a FRIED PIG EAR ON TOP, pretty solid)\nand the only real letdown\nalbondigas - very bland meatballs that were lukewarm, not seasoned, and a little undercooked\n\nSo, including the jamons, that was 8 total small items.  6 small or 4 small + 1 large is probably the right amount for 2 people.\n\nPlenty of good by the glass wine selections, and knowledgeable servers on both food and wine.\n\nFor dessert we had churros con chocolate (thick hot chocolate).  Delicious.  One order is definitely plenty for two.  George of course forgot the size of the order and insisted that we had to get two orders.  I suspected something was up when the waiter said in a very surprised voice, TWO ORDERS!?  The chocolate is great, the churros are pretty good, but not great.  A little too much sugar caked on them for me, but maybe I'm biased because I had to stuff down four of them.\n\nWe ordered way too much, but normal dinner here with a couple of glasses of wine each and dessert/coffee will prob run about $60.

It was our first taste of tapas in a long time, and it was a fabulous, table-pounding experience (not that we actually pounded the table). I always thought tapas were small plates that left you hungry. Contigo's tapas are small, but they are quite satisfying (unless you're a glutton). The secret is their freshness: the flavors seep out of every bite; their apparent simplicity belies their skillful execution. They date the menu, too, so you know it's not a predictable list.\n\nContigo is popular, so get there early if you want a table without waiting for it. On our first visit, on a Saturday around 8 PM, the wait for a table was 40 minutes but the counter was free, so we took it. On our second visit, on a Tuesday at 6, we specifically asked for the counter even though we could have sat anywhere. If you're just two people, by all means opt for the counter: the kitchen is right there and so much fun to watch -- not because it's chaotic but because it's so quiet. Your food is prepared calmly right in front of you -- and handed to you right over the glass partition. Such service!\n\nAs you can see from glancing at the kitchen, and the menu, the ingredients are local and very fresh. The (red and golden) Beets and Pixie Tangerines were a juicy combination, complemented by chopped almonds, arugula, and a dab of smooth ricotta. The Sardine and Avocado Toasts from their wood oven were a revelation: mouthwatering fish atop smooth, buttery avocado (which I normally dislike) and crisp toasts that did not completely fall apart when bitten. Gambas al Ajilloo were garlicky and generously sized Florida white shrimp, whose sauce was worth the price of another order of artisanal bread just for dipping into. Albondigas were tender lamb and pork meatballs served on a delicious puree of almond garlic ajo blanco. \n\nThese four \"pica-pica\" dishes ($8 each or $7 when ordering three or more) and two glasses of Cava (the complex Raventlos i Blanc, $9, and the rose-colored Mont Marcal, $8) were enough to fill us without denting our wallet too much -- and still left room for two desserts: Barcelona-style hot chocolate with crisp churros and a tangy lemon tart with caramelized sugar on the top.\n\nThe tab came to $62 -- steep, yes, but it was really delicious food served with attentiveness and care. Although we noticed on our recent trip to Barcelona that Cava is much less expensive in Spain, we didn't find any tapas dishes there that compare to the quality, fresh local produce, and meats that create the tapas at Contigo. Contigo serves up special, tasty plates using locally sourced ingredients in a relaxed atmosphere. Plus, any restaurant that says on its menu that it's closed May 1st in observance of International Workers' Day knows how to treat its workers right.", "rating": 5, "date": "2009-04-30"}, {"excerpts": ["seated on the patio next to a mini veggie garden we enjoyed the lomo, padron peppers, gem salad, patatas bravas, anchovies on toast, albondigas, and the flatbread.

We went to a nearby bar where we were called at 9:45PM and told that our table was ready.  When we got there, it was actually a bar seat available (there were 3 of us) so we waited for a table (another 15+ minutes).  Okay, no big deal, this place is beautiful inside and we were excited for the experience! \n\nBut, as soon as we sat down our waiter came over and asked us to order right away because the kitchen would be closing at 10.  Um, excuse me?  First of all, it was now 10:05 PM, and we just waited well over an hour for a seat!  Our evening was just starting!! If they couldn't accommodate us in the time their kitchen was open, they should have told us to dine elsewhere as opposed to taking our name and having us wait!\n\nAdditionally, because the menu is tapas, its nice to order over the course of your meal as opposed to all at once.  Anyway, we did not cop any attitude, and did some ordering.  The food was generally good.  I would say the shrimp special was a bit bland, the gem salad just fair but the arugala salad, the albondigas, the vegetarian ratatouille and the duck was very good.  The portions were too small. I mean really.  I did appreciate the sparkling water on tap! That was nice.\n\nHowever, even very good food and nice water cannot increase my star rating.     \n\nAfter our food came OUR WAITER NEVER CAME BACK TO OUR TABLE.  EVER.  We saw him take a seat at the bar, eat his dinner and talk and laugh with the other staff.  Mind you, the restaurant was still FULL of patrons, so it wasn't like we were the last people there.  We had finished a bottle of wine, finished all of our food and NO ONE came to check on us.  We had intended to order more food, more wine, but literally it was like we weren't even in the restaurant!\n\nI finally flagged (after a number of attempts) a bus-boy and asked him for another salad and my friend ordered another drink.  Twenty minutes after that, we flagged someone else down to ask for dessert menus.  \n\nTo top all of this off, two of the owner and/or managers (they seemed like a couple) came to sit at the table next to us and have their dinner.  They kept looking around the restaurant, seemingly oblivious to the horrible service we were receiving. I nearly leaned over and said something!\n\nDuring the time we were attempting to order dessert, we saw our waiter put on his sweater, and leave the restaurant.  He did walk right by our table when he did this, and did say goodbye to the owner/managers sitting next to us.  He never once came over to tell us he was leaving, or that someone else would be finishing serving us.  \n\nMaybe for some folks, a $150 dinner is no big deal - a weekly thing.
