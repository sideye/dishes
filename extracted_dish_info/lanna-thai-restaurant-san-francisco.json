At this point we were very excited about the food, but still wondering why the place was empty.\n\nThe place was empty on a Saturday night because the food is PURE FILTHY GARBAGE!!!! As we sat there waiting patiently for our food, we could hear the beeping  and the opening of the microwave in the kitchen, which looked pretty filthy as well through the little hole in the wall where the food comes out of. \nWe got the soup, which consisted of congealed globs of coconut in a mustard colored soup base with onions and mushrooms and other random pieces of obviously recycled vegetables.  However, the combo of spicy sour tamarind and lemongrass with the smooth creaminess of coconut can never go wrong, so that dish was palatable.  However, the microwaving sounds made the experience eating this soup difficult.   \nThe next course that came was the panang red curry - which looked like wilted precooked and then microwaved crap vegetables in a maroon slim that WAS NOT FREAKIN PANANG.  I gavve my boyfriend a disgusted look but preceded to try it because I was not going to throw it away or send back food at a restaurant where I was the only one present.

I noticed that some Yelpers stated that there were differences in the Yelp hours and the pictures of the restaurant's hours. Even when we went during the restaurant's hours, they were closed! \n\nThe second time I came back here with my mom and all was well. The restaurant was opened. We specifically came back the second time to order the stuffed chicken. We placed our order and drank our tea (btw they charge 1.25$ for tea). The server (he's also the owner of the restaurant) reported back to us that they were out of stuffed chicken. To our dismay, we ended up ordering the Pad Thai dish and the garlic pork chop dish.\n\nFinally, after learning our lesson multiple times, I called the restaurant specifically to ask if they had stuffed chicken. I was expecting a \"No sorry we ran out\" or even a \"Yes we do,\" but I was left listening to a dial tone. Even when the hours were specifically stated that they'd be open, apparently they were closed.\n\nDays later, I called to ask if the stuffed chicken was available and the owner said yes. I ordered takeout and went to pick it up. Let me just tell you, all those times of perseverance paid off...\n\nbecause their stuffed chicken is so so so delicious. They stuff the chicken with vermicelli and cabbage (aka Heaven). The vegetables on the side are cooked with butter. The sauce they provide with the stuffed chicken is like a universal sauce they give as a side for other dishes.\n\nMoral of the story: Call a restaurant before arriving, you never know if they decided to open or close. Make sure to ask if they have that one specific item you're looking for. Their Thai food differs from King of Thai or other Thai restaurants because they literally cook it there fresh for you; you can taste it!

When you look at this place from the street, you'd probably think this place was a little dingy and disappointing. But seriously, I would say Lanna is one of the best kept Thai secrets in San Francisco. Try their stuffed chicken wings--seriously the best I have ever had. Juicy and stuffed with ground pork and noodles and cabbage and fried to a perfect golden brown. Another favorite of mine is the garlic pork chop. It is super flavorful and super garlicky. Yum.

The Rama Tofu is a peanut-curry dish that comes on a bed of steamed spinach - almost had a flavor of a Japanese Gomae. We both felt that there was maybe too much sweetness/sugar though. Would like to see it with the sweetness toned way down, because the dish has great potential - I'd even see if I could order it less sweet, and maybe do some hot sauce with it. The flavor and consistency of the fried tofu in it was excellent, as was the spinach, which is why I might see if the sweet level could be modified.\n\nThe green curry we ordered with just veggies and it was full of them all cooked to perfection. I ordered it hot, which was maybe one degree too much for my friend, but I didn't even have to ask for water so I had no issues with it.

San Francisco is not one city but a cluster of culinary micro-climates like the heavily Asian fog bank that makes up this stretch of Noriega in the Outer Sunset. My massage therapist (yes, I have one...sometimes...don't judge me!) recommended it to me a while ago, and he looks like a very healthy eater with a penchant for spicy Southeast Asian by way of his Malaysian-bred wife. So I convinced Jamie W. to make the trek with me to try it on an evening where we felt the need to try something healthy. We didn't accomplish \"healthy\", but we managed to have some surprisingly good eats for the drive. \n\nWe started with a hearty $6.95 bowl of Tohm Kah, the coconut milk soup with chicken, mushroom, baby corns, green onion, lemongrass and lemon juice (see photo). Perfect starter on a cold night. The $6.25 order of Chicken Satay came with a couple of skewers marinated in curry paste and accompanied by the all-critical peanut sauce with a nice consistency (see photo). Entrees were solid. We went even more predictable with the $7.25 Pad Kee Mao, which offered the thick chow fun noodles mixed with chicken, broccoli and bok choy (see photo). \n\nJamie went back to his Kentucky roots when he was drawn to the $8.50 Barbecue Chicken, which came with four big pieces slathered with a sweet curry sauce that wasn't too overwhelming (see photo). It didn't seem like a particularly Thai dish but who cares. We should have been sated, but we decided to try the desserts since we made room. The $2.75 Flan was delicious enough, but the standout was the $3.75 Fried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream. Fried with a crunchy crust and a nice contrast to the bracing coconut flavor of the ice cream (see photos). Definitely worth a trip out to the far reaches of the Sunset for us downtown types. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...excellent Thai dishes, well priced \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...compact place, could do without the lotto boards \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...good though attention wavers when big parties come in \nTOTAL - 4 stars...barbecue chicken and fried bananas almost give this Thai place a country twang", "rating": 4, "date": "2011-01-04"}, {"excerpts": ["We also had this coconut-based soup, spring rolls, chicken satay, and fried banana with coconut ice cream.
